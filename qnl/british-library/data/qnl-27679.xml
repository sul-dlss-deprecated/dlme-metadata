Dear Sir, h / f 'j. if I am enclosing 3 loose sheets of pa^4 k 1 f''' of the Bahrain 1937 Draft Concession Agreement. The addition to Article 1, (as shewn in the l oose shee ts enclosed) was agreed by Mr.Belgrave. Two other points then remained open: (1) Article No.9 (a), which treats with oil in commercial quantities. Mr.Belgrave considered it should be less than 2000 Tons per day as stated in the Draft submitted. Mr.Belgrave agreed t® SRiKlX to submit to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain a production figure of 1000 Tons per day as being oil in commercial quantities. It was the question referring to Umm-Kisan Island as to whether it be included in the area covered by the Concession Agreement. These two last questions were not discussed again with Mr.Belgrave as in the meantime His Highness the Shaikh decided to defer further discussion-in respect of an oil Concession for the unallotted Area of the State of Bahrain^ for a period of one year. -2— v&gt; rrt ■ i P.T.O.-2- Dubai, 5-5-57. 1 Mr.Belgrave informed me of His Highness' decision on Saturday May 1st. I visited H.H. the Sahikh of Bahrain at Sakhir to call upon His Excellency the Shaikh of Ajrnan, on April the 28th. I arrived late on Suhday evening at Sharjah, the Shaikh of Dubai had returned to Dubai from Bahrain on the evening of Thursday April the 29th, he was unwell on Monday but sent word that he would call at my house to see me on Tuesday afternoon, which he did. The position at the moment is that he is ready to sign the r Concession after he has told his family what occured at the meeting with the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on April the 11th, in Bahrain. It is rumoured that the Shaikh of Kalbah died a few days ago, and that the Shaikh of Ras-al-khaimah had gone by camel to Kalbah to arrange affairs, as the Shaikh of Kalbah and the Shaikh of Ras-al-khaimah are of the same family. The absence of the Shaikh of Ras-al-khaimah from home may cause delay in obtaining his signature to his Concession Agreement. MUSCAT . I am asking the Residency Agent in Sharjah to code the following telegram to the Political Agent of Muscat:- -5- P.T.O.If 1 _5_ Dubai, 5-5-37• ' Political Agent Muscat ' Certain alteration in text of Concession ' Agreement Muscat B suggested by London ' Office are now in printers hands Stop ' The revised sheets containing alterations ' are expected arrive in Sharjah in about ' 10 days time and which will be sent to ' Political Resident for approval Stop ' Then if Kalbah event does not cause undue ' delay in concluding with Has— al—khaimah ' Ruler who is Kalbah Ruler's relation then ' Holmes should be ready visit Muscat at ' end of May Stop Regret delay in replying ' your telegram HOLMES '.

Mr. Belgrave agreed to reopen the subject with the Sheikh. Mr. Belgrave did so yesterday morning. Sheikhs Abdullah gynri Sulaiman were also present with His Highness. Neither His Highness nor the others present wished to reopen the negotiations. They wished Mr. Belgrave to point out that exactly the same message was given to each Company so neither Company should feel that any particular dis crimination was made in its case.

I do not consider that it is advisable to aomit the inclu sion of this addition. It is possible but not probable that in future certain areas which are now external to the State of Bahrain may be included within the Shaikh's Do mains and it is not improbable that Oil Concession Agree ments will have already* beon approved by His Majesty*s Government for such areas.

WALTOM.PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED City-Gate Houses PinsLury Square, London, E.C.8. 16th August, 193?. Dear Mr. 'Walton, As you know, we were desirous some months ago of obtaining a concession for the unallotted portion of the Bahrain Group of Islands. i /e appeared to be on the point of obtaining this when the Shaikh requested a postponement of negotiations for twelve months, owing to the difference which had arisen between him and the Shaikh of Qatar regarding Zubarah. Information now reaches us from Bahrain to the effect that the Shaikh would in all probability be willing to give us all the unallotted territory, on terms already substantially agreed between him and Major Holmes, acting on our behalf, provided that a clause be inserted in the concession agreement that 'no effort would be made to develop the oil resources of the Zubarah area'. Zubarah is, of course, on the mainland of Qatar and therefore included m our 03.tar concession. As E.M.o-., have ratified that concession (with its description the area covered, and its map attached) we assume your visw to be that Zubarah is part of the territory already granted us by the Shaikh of Qatar. Thus if we give the undertaking now asked for by the Shaikh of Bahrain we should appear tc be asking for the same territory twice over, and also, by implication, admitting the Bahrain claim to Zubarah, which would be hotly resented by the Shaikh of Qatar. At/ F # Z. 5452/37 PC.26/432At the same time we remain anxious to obtain the unallotted portion of the Bahrain IslandSs and. we feel that a formula for these could perhaps he j.ound which would leave the Zuharah question completely on one side. Might this he done, for instance, 'by emphasising the ?;ord 'Islands', that is, hy asking for 'the unallotted portion of Bahrain Island and all the other Islands under the Sovereignty of the Shaikh of Bahrain?' Do you think that the Political Resident would he able to advise the Shaikh that a concession in these terms would do nothing to deprive him of any claims to Zuharah (on the mainland) which he might ultimately he ahle to substantiate? We feel at the moment some difficulty about proceeding further with active operations on Qatar until we have obtained rights over the Bahrain group since the latter include the Hawar Islands; if, for example, investigations proved Qatar to be valuable, this would be likely to create intensive competition for the Hawar Group. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) Stephen H. Longrigg J.C.

His Majesty's Government would not, of course, be ahle, in any event, to agree to any alteration of the wording of the draft Concession which would give the Sheikh the impression that they are prepared to recognise his claim to ZUbarah. roura stnoeMiSfr (SUJ.O.WALTOS.

No. C/682-10/14 Political Agency, Bahrain, 2Snd September 1937 From, Captain T. Hickinbotham, I. A., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to India Office printed letter Ho. P.Z.5452/1937 dated the 28th August 1937. 2. I understand from Mr. C.D. Belgrave, C.B.E., the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, that there is at pre sent no intention of reopening the negotiations for the unallotted area. I have also enquired from Mr. E. Y. Packer, the local representative of the Petroleum Concessions Limitec and he tells me that he has made no comnunication to the Bahrain Government with regard to the reopening of negotia tions to date. 3. Mr. Belgrave informs me that when Major Frank Holmes was proceeding to the United Kingdom by Imperial Airways, he met him at the Moharraq Aerodrome and asked him quite unofficially whether it might be possible for him to obtain the views of his ConDany with regard to the insertion of a clause similar in effect to the one mentioned in para graph 2 of Petroleum Concessions Limited 1 s letter No. PC/ C 26/432 dated the 16th August 1937. I understand that Mr. Belgrave did not mean this to be taken in any way as offi cial and that it was in the nature of a private communica tion in order to obtain the private views of the Company. 4. There appear to be three points to be dealt with when considering Petroleum Concessions Limited's letter under/-under reference, and they are, firstly, the assumption that Zubarah Is part of the territory concession for which has been granted to them by the Shaikh of Qatar In the terms of the Qatar Concesslonj secondly. Petroleum Con cessions Limited's suggestion that they might emphasise the word 'Islands' In order to avoid any complication which might arise by the mention of Zubarah In the Con cession for the unallotted area; and thirdly, the poli tical effect of the inclusion of any clause which in any way restricts the Oil Company's development of the Zubarah area. 5. The first point raised by the Company is the assump tion that His Majesty's Government agree that Zubarah Is part of the territory the concession for which has already been granted to them by the Shaikh of Qatar. They base their assumption on the fact that His Majesty's Government have ratified that Concession, which is said to contain the description of the area covered and to have a map at tached. Article 2 of the Qatar Oil Concession is presumably the one which is meant when they refer to the description of the area and it reads as follows:- 'The State of Qatar means the whole area over which the Shaikh miles and which is marked on the north of the line drawn on the map attach ed to this Agreement,' # At the same time when the Qatar Concession was ratified the question of Zubarah was dormant and it had been dor mant since about 1905. The Shaikh of Bahrain did not raise the question and naturally the Shaikh of Qatar, who claims the Zubarah area, did not open the question. As a result of this. His Majesty's Government failed to consider the possibility of the Shaikh of Bahrain reviving his old claims/-claims to Zubarah and the more remote possibility of his being able to substantiate such claims. It was unfortunate that this point was overlooked at the time, but overlooked it was, and it remains for us to see whether the ratification of the Oil Agreement in any way committed His Majesty's Government with regard to the definition of the area 'under the rule of the Shaikh of Qatar.' From an examination of Article S of the Qatar Oil Concession I am inclined to the view that His Majes ty' s Government are in no v /ay committed, for the state of Qatar is defined as being 'the whole area over which the Shaikh rules and which is marked on the north of the line drawn on the map attached to this Agreement.' If the Shaikh of Bahrain eventually succeeds in proving his claim to the area known as Zubarah then ipso facto the Shaikh of Qatar cannot/said to rule over that area and, therefore, that area cannot be considered as part of the state of Qatar. However, I do not think it ad visable to reply to that part of the Co Bp any's letter which deals with this point at the moment. 6» The second point raised by the Company, i.e. the possibility of their ea^hasising the ¥.*ord 'Islands' does not appear difficult and I can see no harm in their in cluding a formla similar to the one suggested in their letter under reference but I would suggest that they speci fically state what is understood by the Bahrain Islands. They might, for instance, mention 'the unallotted portion of the Island of Bahrain and the other Islands constituting the Bahrain group' and in addition I would prefer to see a list of Islands which are said by them and by the Shaikh to constitute the Bahrain group so that there can be no question/-question of any Misunderstanding with regard to which islands were intended. 7« The third point is the political effect of this move by His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, unofficial though it be, on the present relations between Qatar and Bahrain and its effect on statements which have al - ready been made to ourselves by His Highness the Ruler with regard to his attitude towatds the Oil Company and their possible operations in the Zubarah area. On the 5th of May 19S7 a conference took place between His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin »Isa al Khalifah, K.C.I.E,, C.S.I., his brother Shaikh Abdullah bin 'Isa, his son Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, the Honourable the Political Resident and myself at which the Adviser to the Bahrain Government was present and the first and principal point ishich was discussed was the question of His Highness' attitude with regard to the Qatar Oil Agreement. His Highness 1 attitude as stated then is described in my letter D.0.No.C/334-4/13 dated the 5th May addressed v / to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, a copy of whijbh was sent to you under my printed letter Mo. T/16-4/13 dated the 29th May 1337. For easy reference I quote from paragraph S of the letter mentioned above n (a) His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain agreed that, if his claim to Zubarah was upheld, he had no objection to the Oil Conpany, who at present held the Qatar lease, work ing within or below the area and that his claim to the Zubarah area in no way affect ed the present lease of the Qatar Oil Com pany; (b) That he had no objection to the Oil Company constructing a port within the area of Zu barah and he stated that he would be respon sible for the protection of the said port.'so that His Highness' attitude was that with regard to the Zubarah question he was prepared to waive any pos sible oil rights that he might have had in that area. If his claim was upheld then he waives his rights; if his claim was not upheld then naturally the point does not arise. It would now appear, if the information con tained in the Company's letter is to be accepted literal ly, that His Highness, having already assured us that the question of his claim to Zubarah would not affect the Oil Lease and that he had no objection to the development of Oil in the area, is now endeavouring to prevent the deve lopment of the Zubarah area by the inclusion of a clause in the Agreement for the Bahrain unallotted area. This amounts to an allegation that His Highness is indulging in what can only be described as double-dealing. I ay- self do not for one moment believe that it was His High ness' intention to go back on his statement of the 5th May and in my opinion there has been a great deal of mis understanding. However, misunderstanding or no misunder standing, I consider that we should be wrong in any way to acquiesce in such a clause being inserted in the Agreement for the unallotted area, for, in the first place it might be read to imply that the Shaikh of Bahrain has territorial rights in the Qatar Peninsula, and secondly, it would have a bad effect on the already strained relations between Qatar and Bahrain should it ever come to the knowledge of the Shaikh of Qatar that such a clause had been included in the Oil Agreement, 8, While discussing this question, I wish to suggest a possible solution to the problem and at the same time a te possible solution to the Zubarah problem. The solution would/-would be for the Ruler of Bahrain and the Ruler of Qatar to agree that the Zubarah area be held by the Ruler of Bahrain as the personal property of the Shaikhs of Bah rain, and that His Majesty's Government should be re quested to agree to this compromise with the proviso that the mineral rights, i.e. oil, etcetera, in that area remain vested in the Shaikh of Qatar and that Petro leum Concessions/Limited who are the Company operating in the Qatar Peninsula should have every right of access for the development and working of Oil that might be lo cated in that area. Although the possibility of the two Rulers agreeing in this is by no means certain, I think it not unlikely that some such suggestion will be put for ward in the not very distent future as I have reasons to believe that various influential personages whose interests are proportionately divided between the two States are doing their utmost to bringing about a settlement of the Zubarah question.

I feel that it would be more satisfactory in every way for matter to be kept in suspense by Shaikh's refusal to modify decision to post pone negotiations until May 1938. Delay will afford opportunity for feeling over Zubarah to cool and there are other considerations. I hope that you may find it possible to influence Shaikh in this direction, 2. As regards Company's letter to you of Sep tember 23rd I have no confirmation that India Office have agreed to the renewed and direct approach by Company to Shaikh. You will remember that Bahrain Petroleum Company will have ground for complaint if negotiations ®re opened without their knowledge (see^-their letter to you of May 1st). 3. My interpretation of Shaikh's undertaking of 29th May 1937 relative to Zubarah would be that clause 'if his claim to Zubarah was upheld' was intended to operate as strict condition, failing fulfilment of which Shaikh would feel himself free to withdraw his agreement to operations at Zuba rah.

I agree, but if his claiiji to Zubarah were not upheld then Shaikh would have no say in the matter of Oil operations there and would presumably be discouraged from including clauses detri mental to and concerning territory of Shaikh of Qatar in agreement for unallotted area.

Longrigg, Esq., Petroleum Concessions Ltd., City Gate House, Finsbury Circus, E.G. 2. Yours sincerely. Sgd. J.C.WALTONMr. Longrigg and Mr. Packer came to see me this morning. It appears that yesterday Mr. Longrigg approach ed Mr. Belgrave with the proposal that he should discuss with His Highness the Shaikh the possibility of reopening at once negotiations for a Concession for the Unallotted Area at Bahrain and the Islands of the Bahrain Group. Mr. Belgrave, after consulting His Highness, informed Mr. Long- rigg this morning that the Shaikh was not prepared to re open the matter at present. Mr. Longrigg informed me that he was very disappointed by this decision as he had come a long way with the definite intention of trying to push forward that matter. He felt that he ought to have been allowed to raise the matter in conversation with His Highness himself and he did not quite like being, as it were, warned off, I was able to assure him that it was not a question of being denied access to His Highness for the purpose of discussing business, but that Mr. Belgrave had merely interpreted to him the decision of His Highness the Shaikh^which I myself knew to be quite definite. 2. Mr. Longrigg also had some apprehension that the American Company might be able to obtain access to His Highness and to negotiate a concession for the whole of the balance of the Bahrain Group of Islands without his own company knowing anything about it. On this point I gave him a definte assurance that when His Highness the Shaikh was prepared to consider once more offers for the Unallotted Area, Petroleum Concessions Limited would be informed^ and that there was no possibility whatsoever of their waking up one morning to find that the American Com- pany had obtained Concession while their own negotiations had been held up at the request of the Shaikh. I said that/-'that if and when His Highness showed an inclination to consider offers from either Company it would un questionably be necessary for the other company to be informed. 3. Mr. Longrigg also asked my advice on the ques tion of the formula to be used in describing the area for which a concession should be sought, in order to obviate the possibility of Zubarah becoming a stumbling block. He suggested referring to the Unallotted Area of Manamah Island (assuming that his Company continued to bid for that), plus other islands of the Bahrain Group, which were to be definitely named. I said that I thought it would be very wise to proceed on these lines, if only for the purpose of obviating any future doubt as to the e xtent of their Concession, if they obtained one. 4.

He a am strai^it throu^i Basra, staying there only an hour or two. 3» I returned his call at the Agency on the 27th, and he soon began to be, apparently, confiding. 4. He ssl d that his object this winter waa to obtain concessions, for the I.P.O., for three of Ifee finest potential oil fields In the world. He was sorry he wi s working for the I.P.O., as it was not wholly British, but what could he do. He would much prefer to work for a British Company and he ted recently interested two British groups in the same schemes. Here I tried to make him explain why he had not continued with them. He said that it was owing to the Red Line Agreement, and then turned for a time to other subjects. 5, Reverting to oil, he said 'what do I want? - I have got money w . '♦A Peerage is what I want'. Here he gave a brief chuckle, but I was left with the impression that it was not entirely ffecetiousness. /'Vi i Political Agency, Euwa it, 1st April 1938, / / r refer to your telegran No.T/88 Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Bahrain. 6./10./ 6. H© then showed me his plans printed for him he sa id by 'Allen' or Alan' in Igypt. (They were blue prints based on the Admiralty charts) (a) One area is 23 miles Norlh and South, by 17 miles Bast and West, covering the FASHT AJ JARIM peerl banks, with a corner (somewhere about SHURAIBA to BUDIYA} of Bahrein for necessary storing of material and oamps. He spoke most confidently about the valuable nature of the FASHT as a geological 'structure'. (b) The next plan showed an equally large aree taking in an oblong block down the Bahrain bay i.e. between Behrein Islands and ^atar. (c) I asked where was the third plan, but he said that it msnot ready yet and did not volunteer ■fee location of the area. 7. He led me to believe feat the I.P.C. bad approached the India office on 1he subject of these concessions, and that as soon as the Hon'ble the Res ideaS; returned from London he hoped to get down to Bahrain, where he sa id, the Sheikh knew about the scheme in principle, and had conversed about it with him before now. 8. H© asked me what was the position about rights at sea in the Persian Gulf, and before I could reply said that in these days it was no good trying to keep the Gulf exclusively fbr the British. How would we like it if some foreign power or neighbouring country just came in and insisted on having this area? We could do nothing. The sea was free. 9. He appeared to be about to become extremely upset but suddenly quietened down. 'Imight go to Ibn Saud', he said, but then as quickly added 'No I would not go to that raaif!,and gave a shudder.10. TMs is the gist of what he told me about his projects in the Gulf this winter. 11. Incidentally he was rather amusing about a gold mine in Austria which he had 'hawked* 1 in Amerioa and London, and got rid of 'just in tiaie' 'I expect they are after me now he said. Generally he seems vary full of life and fitter tban last year. 12. He has jiKst left for Iraq for some days, possibly in connection, with the taking up of the area just North of JOiwait, which owing to oil being found here, is now becoiae a matter of interest in His oil world.

Copies of this letter (with enclosures) are being sent to the Government of India and to the Political Agent, Bahrein. Youra Bincsrety.P.Z.2i|.12/3c 1% In considering T/hat portion of the Bahrein 'unallotted area' they should apply for, etroleum Concessions Ltd. have taken into account the known desire of the Sheikh to divide ^ the area between their Company and the Bahrein Petroleum Company. It is for this reason that they have for the moment given up the idea of applying :Jor the whole of the * 'unallotted area 55 . A ;■ * 2. Maps showiru the ti?o areas which they hope to obtain are attached at the 'bac'.: of the draft concession; for eass of reference I attach a rougn sketch map showing the total area covered by the two maps. 3» 'I'he proposed concession area includes certain non- 55 §£ territorial waters ? and it is suggested that we should seek outside the generally ) the advice of the Foreign Office as to whether there accepted three) mile limit. ; is any objection to this. Apart from a number of very small islands and reefs ? the proposed concession area also includes the folloy/ing islands (a) Fasht al Jarin and Khor Pasht, which lie to the North of the Bahrein Island; ( Td ) Pasht Dibal, which lies to the North-Past of the main Bahrein Island; and (c) the Hawar group of islands, which lie 3outh-East of the main Bahrein Island off the coast of Qatar. 5- All the above are claimed by the Bahrein G-overnment. The Ruler of ^atar has not been consulted in the matter, but the political ..gent, Bahrein; considers it possible that he might claim Pasht Bibal and that it is practically certain that he would claim the Kawar group. As regards the latter, it will be recalled that the question of the ownership of the/the Hawar Islands was considered in 1936 (see p 9 Z.^582/36 in Colin. 30/123) in connection with the earlier negotiations for the Bahrein 'unallotted area n . The decision then reached was u that on the evidence then available these Islands appeared to belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein? and that the burden of disproving his claim lay on other potential claimants 51 . This decision was communicated verbally to Mr. Belgrave (by Mr. ¥alton) on the l6th July? 1936., and it was explained to him that it would be impossible to give a final ruling without knowing whether the Sheikh of Qatar has a claim? and hearing it if he has one. Hitherto no attempt has been made to determine the sovereignty of the islands in question as between Bahrein and Qatar; but in view of the manner in which it has been raised by Petroleum Concessions Ltd.? a decision cannot be delayed further? and as a first step it is suggested that we should obtain the views of Sir Trenchard Fowle. Sd. A.C.B. Syrnon k/k Sir T. Powle, May Yie have your views please ? P.C.L. are pressing for an early decision because the year ? s interval laid down by the Sheikh expires on 1st May. Sd. A.G.B. Symon 5Aqo Mr- Symoiic, _ — y j Re our discussion and your note of the kth April. Until the 'unallotted area tl came into the front of the picture there was no object in H.M.G. giving a definite decision on the ovaiersnip of Hawar and this question could he left in the position described in para. 5 of your note • 2. Now ? however? that the P.G.L. want to commence negotiations with the Sheikh concerning this area in which Hawar is situated? H.M.Q. will have to give a decision as the Company will want to know 'before entering on negotiations whether Hawar does or does not 'belong to Bahrein. 3* The same remarks mutatis mu tandi s apply to the island of Fasht Dihal. U- I suggest Jiie following action:- (a) a letter to 'be written by me as Political Resident under instructions from H.M.G. to the Sheikh of Qatar? informing him that in connection with negotiations v/hich certain Companies are about to commence the question of the ownership of Hawar and Fasht Dibal must be decided. On the evidence at present available to H.M.G-. these islands appear to belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. H.M.G-.? however? have reason to believe that he? the Sheikh of Qatar? may wish to advance claims to these islands. If so he should submit these claims to H.M.G-. v/ithin a certain period (say two months) from the date of the letter? after which no claims should be considered. (b) a letter to be sent to the Sheikh of Bahrein enclosing a copy of the letter to the Sheikh of Qatar and explaining that when the the latter ? s reply has been/been received it rrould be communicated to him, the Sheikh of Bahrein. The latter will then have an opportunity of rebutting the claim of the Sheiich of Qatar should the latter advance one. (c) a second letter to be sent to the Sheikh of Bahrein referring to letter (b) and asking him if he would be good enoug, to postpone negotiations with the Companies concerned until the ownership of Hawar and Pasht Dibal have been decided. (d) a letter to be sent to the P.C.L. and to Bapco. informing them of the action taken. 5. The possible objection to the above line of action is that it may put ideas into the head of the Sheikh of 'Qatar. However., I am pretty sure that the ideas are there already and we cannot risk the muddle that would ensue if s after the P.C.L. and Bapco. had commenced negotiations on the assumption that the islands belong to Bahrein, the Sheikh of atar were to come forward with a sound claim. Apart from this it is only fair, I think, to Qatar, to give him an opportunity of having his say. 6. Prom the political point of view it will suit quite well if we give Hawar to Bahrein, as this will balance our previous decision of giving ^ubara to ^atar. 7. With regard to para. 3 of your note. As you suggest I think we should get the advice of the P .O. as to whether there is any objection. Sd. T.C. PowleHull 1 - A A *INDIA OFFICii!. P.Z.2412/38.

Last May (see enclosure to our printed letter No .p. Z.3824/37 of the 18th June, 1937) Belgrave informed the Political Agent, Bahrein, that the Sheikh had decided to postpone all discussions and negotiations regarding the unallotted area for one year, and, as you will/dee from the enclosed copy of a telegram dated 51st March, 1938, from the officiating Political Resident, the Bahrein Government have recently confirmed their intention not to resume negotiations until the year's interval ends. In the normal way, therefore, we may expect negotiations to recommence sometime after 1st May, but, as will be apparent from the ensuing, a complication has arisen. 3. Last week Mr. Lewisohn and Mr. Longrigg called here on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in order to leave the/ Brenan, Esq., OBE., Foreign Office.the enclosed copy of the draft lease relating to parts of the 'Bahrein unallotted area' and to say that the Company v/ished to know whether H.M. G. have any objection to their applying to the Sheikh (at the appropriate time) for a concession over the two areas indicated in the maps attached to the draft concession. The Company are anxious for an early decision in order that everything should be in readiness for the time when the Sheikh \V^ u indicates his willingness to open discussions. We have taken the opportunity of Powle's presence here to' discuss the question with him, and I do not thvnk I can do . better than to send you a copy of our Minutes, prima facie Powle's proposal to get the Sheikh to postpone negotiations until the ownership of the Hawar and other islands has been decided appears to be the best solution, and, subject to any views which the Foreign Office may have to offer, it is proposed to proceed on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 of,his Note. 4. As the matter is of some urgency we should be grateful for an early reply, and in due course we shall be glad to have your advice in regard to the point dealt with in paragraph 3 of Symon's note. 5. Would you kindly return the draft concession with your reply. Yours sincerely,. (Sgd) J.P.GIBSONMs 0 P.Z. 2727/1938. FOHDIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. (S 1985/413/91) April, 1938.

In view of the impending oil negotiations we feel that a decision on this question will he convenient and we agree with the views expressed by Powle in v cyv paragraph 5 of his minute? of the 5th April and with the proposed procedure for ascertaining the attitude of the Sheikh of Qatar before oil negotiations are resumed. 3. T fe thinlc it should be made clear to the company that any decision taken with regard to the sovereignty or ownership of the islands only holds good to the extent that His Majesty's Government are in a position to take and enforce a decision i.e. as between one protected State and another, and cannot be held to preclude His Majesty's Government from admitting the sovereignty of any foreign Power which may hereafter put forward a claim to the islands i f His Ma.l &amp;ajai^-e---a.

Concessions, Limited, on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. P Mr.B.»T. Peel (in the Chair) Sir T.Powle) ) Mr.LewisohnlHepresenting Mr.Gibson ) India Office. )petroleum Mr.Longrigg)Cone essions Mr-Symon ) )Liraited. Mr.Longrigg opened the discussion by saying that there were three matters which he wished to raise, Tiz:- A. The position in regard to the Koweit Neutral Zone; B. The position in regard to the Bahrein Unallotted Area; C. The position on the Trucial Coast, etc. 2. With regard to A (the Koweit ileutral Zone), Mr.Longrigg said tha/t as a result of our refusal to allow Major Holmes to act as their negotiator at Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast, Major Holmes had severed his connection with Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and the Company were afraid that he might now resume his connection with the California Company. Major Holmes was now at Koweit to consult with the Sheikh regarding the Neutral Zone and owing to his influence with the Sheikh they were apprehensivi lest he might persuade the Sheikh to give the concession to American interests before Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had been given a further opportunity of putting forward their proposals. Mr.Longrigg then went on to express the hope that His Majesty's Government might their way to discourage American interests, or at least to ensure that the Sheikh did not cede his oil rights in the Ueutral Zone until Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had been given a fair opportunity/1$ ^ 2. o opportunity of competing. He was promised that the Comparing! views would receiv e co nsideratio n. 3. With regard to B (the Bahrein Unallotted Area), Mr.Longrigg referred to his previous call on the 31st March, at which he had left a copy of the Company's draft lease relating to parts of the Bahrein Unallotted Area and he said that here again the Company were concerned about the future intentions of Major Holmes, who was fully informed as to their proposals. The Ccmpany were satisfied that there was little chance of the Sheikh of Bahrein giving them the whole of the Unallotted Area and that they had been led to believe that the Sheikh intended to give everything except the Hawar Group of islands to the Americans. For this reason they had departed frcm their original intention to compete for the whole of the Unallotted Area; but while they were prepared to leave the main island out of their plans, they wanted rather more than the Hawar Group and he hoped that His Majesty's Government would feel able to support the Company on the basis of the draft concession. Sir Trenchard Fowle intervened at this stage to point out that the Company's proposed concession area included certain islands (i.e. the Hawar Group and Fasht Dibal) whose ownership as between Bahrein and Qatar had not yet been clearly determined. While on the evidence at present available to His Majesty's Government these islands belonged to Bahrein there was reason to 'suppose that the Sheikh of Q,atar might wish to advance claims to them and he thought that it might be preferable to ask the Sheikh of Bahrein to postpone the resumption of negotiations for a short period (say two or three months) in order that the question of ownership could be final^/ determined. This suggestion/ 'T'7; 3. 3€ This seems to 'be the o-ase - In the fltar concession (Article 2) the State of Qatar is defined as 'the whole of the area over which the Sheikh rules and which is marked on the north of line drawn on the map attached to the Agreement. ' A. C . B. S. 19.4.38. suggestion had 'been put to Lord C adman. in a recent conversation and it was understood that His Lordship was agreeable. Mr.Longrigg said, however, that the Company were opposed to any postponement and he personally thought it would he a pity to put ideas of ownership into the mind of the Sneikh of Qatar. He pointed out, moreover, that if enquiries showed that the islands in question belonged to H the Sheikh of Qatar, they would be included in the concession which tne Company had already obtained from that Ruler; and he said that by entering into negotiations with the Sheikh of Bahrein for them, the Company were merely running the risk of paying twice for the same thing. The Company were prepared to take this chance and would definitely prefer to carry on with the negotiations without any postponement. Sir Trenchard Powle said that he had not appreciated the latter point and that in the circumstances he was inclined to withdraw his suggestion for postponing the negotiations. Mr . Peel wound up this par t of the d iscussion by s aying that t he views put fo rward pn_ behalf of the Co mpany would_be carefully considered an d tha t a gi^n as soon as_possible. 4. With regard to C (the Trucial Coast, etc.), Mr.Longrigg said that there were two separate points, viz: (1) Concessions; (2) Exploration. With regard to (l) (Concessions), the present position was that the Company had obtained concessions in respect of Debai and Sharjah; but so far all efforts to induce the remaining Sheikhs to come into line had proved unavailing. As far as was reasonably possible, the Company had met the various demands put forward by the Sheikhs and he thought that fully adequate terms had been offered; but the Sheikhs seemed/. , ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ' ■ , ■seemed to 'be completely out of hand and appeared to be convinced that eventually they could get whatever terms they liked to ask, A state of deadlock had been reached and the Company felt that unless His Ma f jesty f s Government were prepared to intervene, the only alternative open to them was to temporarily withdraw their negotiators. Asked for his views, Sir Trenchard Fowle said he thought that if the Sheikhs were left alone, for say six months ? they Y /ould probably come round and accept the Gompany f s offers. Mr. Longrigg said, however, that in cil matters waiting usually resulted in bigger demands and 'he thought that delay in cominp; to terms might make it more difficult for the Sheikhs to withdraw from their present position. If, however, the Political Resident advised waiting, the Company would of course accept his advice, but they hoped that it would be found possible to do something to hasten matters. Mr. Le wisohn then a sked if the Company cou ld regar d their pres ent privileged position as watertight and w as inf ormed that for t he present; at any rat e, they had no need to worry on th is sco re. Mr. Ley/isohn then went on to say that he thought that the Political agreement might have something to do with the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah f s refusal to come to terms and he a'sked whether His Majesty's Government regarded it as essential to obtain the Sheikh ! s agreement. Mr. Longrigg agreed with his colleague and suggested that the terms of the agreement were sufficiently binding ^n the Company without bringing in the Sheikhs. Mr. Peel pointed out, however, that as t/zo of the Sheikhs , namely Debai and Sharjah, had recognised the agr e ements 5 it might be difficult not to follow the same procedure in the case of the others, but he promised that the quest ion would be re-examined . As regards exploration, Mr. Longrigg said that from the Company's point of view, the present situation was completely/completely unsatisfactory. He said that although much of the territory concerned could probably be written off as valueless., some parts appeared to have definite interest and they must see it all» Up to the present the Company f s efforts to visit certain ,f interesting^ areas through the medium of the Trucial Sheikhs had been unsuccessful and the Company had formed the conclusion that it would probably be best to leave the Trucial Sheikhs alone for the time being and to try and operate through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg mentioned in this connection that he had seen the Sultan during the latter^ recent visit to London and had been told that in addition to certain parts of Muscat territory5 the Sultan might be able to arrange for a party to reach Baraimi (which the Sultan claimed belonged to him) through Muscat. Mr. Lonp:ri f g:ff said that this su g gesti o n seemed to offer greater promise of getting something done and he enquired whether it might not be possible for His Ma t iesty ! s Government to co -operate with the Sultan , He wa s pro m ised th at the point would be considered , 5. Sir Trenchard Fowle mentioned that during his recent conversation with Lord Cadman he had been asked to suggest the name of a suitable person to act for Petroleum Concessions Limited in connection with the forthcoming negotiations at Bahrein and Koweit, Sir T. Fowle said that normally he would hesitate to give advice^ but as the present circumstances were somewhat peculiar he was prepared to do so. The names which occurred to him were Messrs,Longrigg, Lermitte and Packer and he said that so far as the local Political authorities were concernedp all these gentlemen would be acceptable. He also thought that they would be acceptable to the Rulers concerned. A. C. B. S. INDIA OFFICE. 12th April 1958.Whitehall, S.T, 1 a P.Z.2727/38. IMMEDIATE. 20th April, 1938. My dear Brenan /' Would you kii&gt;uly refer to your letter of the 13th J April (No/E,1986/413/91) and part (3) of the enclosed record of a further discussion with representatives of Petroleum Concessions Limited ahout the resumption of oil negotiations for the 'Bahrein unallotted area' 1 ? As you will see from the record of the discussion on 12th April, Fowle is now prepared to withdraw his suggestion for postponing the negotiations and in the light of the representations put forward on 'behalf of the Company we are inclined to tell them forthwith that so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned there is no objection to their applying to the Sheikh of Bahrein (at the appropriate time) for a concession over the two areas indicated in the maps attached to the draft concession, subject to any reservation which the Foreign Office may consider desirable in regard to non-territorial waters . At the same time it would be made clear to the Company V. Brenan, Esq.jQ.B.Ei Foreign Office, S.W.I, that/that any decision subsequently taken with regard to the . sovereignty or ownership of the islands or reefs included in the proposed concession areas will only hold good to the extent that His Majesty 1 s GoYerninent are in a position to take and enforce a decision^ i.e. as between one protected State ana another, and cannot be held to preclude His Majesty's Government from admitting the sovereignty of any foreign Power which may hereafter put 'forward a claim to the islands or reefs if His Majesty 1 s Government in their sole discretion think it expedient to admit that We should be glad to hear as soon as possible whether the Foreign Office agree with the above procedure, and, if so, what reservation, if any, should be made regarding non-territorial waters. If we act on the lines suggested we must, of course, explain the position to the Shaikh of Bahrein and it is possible that he himself may- wish to postpone negotiations until the question of ownership has been settled; but we shall have done our best, from the Company's point of view, if we tell them now that so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned, and subject to the warning we propose to give them regarding/o • regarding the ovmership of the islanas? and reefs., the way is clear to negotiate on the basis of their draft lease. Copies of this letter and of the connected ftJC \ correspondence are being sent to Seal and Starling. We cannot let them have copies of the draft lease as the copy enclosed with my letter of 7th April'is the only one which the Company can spare at this' stage; but we are sending them a copy of Article 1 of the draft lease (which defines the proposed concession areas) and copies of the J two maps attached .to the draft lease, I enclose copies / of the latter for your file. , Would you kindly return the draft lease with your reply?

Iimnediate. &amp; V Ivly dear Gibsoiip / Ye have been considering your letter P.Z. 2727/38 of the 20th April about the resumption of negotiations for the ^Bahrein unallotted area u . In the light of the further discussions which you have held witn the representatives of Petroleum Concessions / Limited we agree generally^ subject to a suggestion by Beckett, referred to below, to the line which the India Office propose to take in their reply to the Company regarding their not further postponing their approach to the Sheikh. \ 1 \ * i Beckett has made certain suggestions as regards the wording of the second part of Article 1 of the Draft Lease, a copy of which formed an enclosure to your letter of the 7th April and which I now return, and I cannot do better L \^p than send you a copy of his minui?€nerewith. If his suggestion as regards the substitution of the words 'submerged land' for 'waters' is adopted there wil . of course be no need to use in your reply to the Company the words 'underlined in paragraph 2 of your letter. I am sending copies of this letter to Seal and Starling. Yours sincerely, Sd. T.V. Brenan J. P. G -ibson Esq.r7 FOREIGN OFFICE, S. 7.I. I Gcry (E 2288/1+13/91) I - ^ 1 There are two points on which I should like to say something, the first concerns the Hawar, group of islands. The position here is as I understand it, that these islands probably belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but may conceivably belong to the Sheikh of Qatar or even to Ibn Saud. The company v/ish to secure the rights over these islands by this concession on the assumption that they belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. If they belong to the Sheikh of Qatar they have already got rights over them under their agreement with Qatar and if they should turn out to belong to Ibn Saud they realise that neither this proposed agreement nor the agreement with Qatar will give them any rights there and that they are not getting any guarantees by H.M.G. that a claim by Ibn Saud will not be recognised by them. This being the position, it seems to be to be better to word the 'Secondly' in Article 1 of the draft concession as follows, 'The whole of that portion of the Sheikh's dominions (leased area No. 2) including all J v ^ islands, reefs, shoals and waters belonging to the Sheikh within the following boundary limits ....' The boundary limits which are defined by geographical co-ordinates clearly go round the Hawar group of islands and therefore if they belong to the Sheikh the concession covers them. On the other hand, the fact that they are not mentioned in this way by name avoids the difficulty that the concession definitely contains a statement that the islands do belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. This way of treating the matter seems to me to be/be more appropriate in view of the circamstances indicated above. Then there is the point about territorial waters which arises as I understand it in this way. 'The proposed concession refers to all v/aters within the proposed leased area, and the area includes waters outside 3 mile limit, but it cannot be intended that the oil should actually be extracted from the sea water and the intention I think; must be to obtain the right to extract oil from the land under the sea within this area and this point is relevant because so far as the water is concerned not only does the Sheikh have no right over water outside the three mile limit but also in the ordinary way he cannot acquire by occupation or prescription any sovereignty over such water. On the other hand, as regards the sea bed and the land under the bed, although the Sheikh has at present no right to such land outside the three mile limit, it is recognised that the bed of the sea and the land under it is capable of acquisition by occupation beyond the three mile limit. And indeed both pearl fisheries and Cornish tin mines which extend beyond the three mile limit are held to have been appropriated in this w .y. Consequently, I should thint that it would be better to substitute for the word 'waters- 1 the words -submerged land' 1 , so that the phrase would run 'islands, reefs, shoals and submerged land belonging to the Sheikh comprised ....' The effect of this would be that the company would get the right to the land below the sea immediately within the three mile limit and also outside the three mile limit as soon as they had appropriated it, its appropriation by the company having the effect I think of also vesting it in the Sheikh from the point of view of sovereignty since the company are working under a concession from the Sheikh/Sheikh. j±t any rate the insertion of the phrase 'belonging to the Sheikh' gets over any difficulties from our point of vieT/ as regards territorial waters.

Z. 2904/38. WHITEHALLf S. W. I. 29th April,. 1938. /V 1 With reference to the recent discussions about the resumption of negotiations for the Bahrein unallotted area, I am now desired to inform you that, subject to what is said below, there is no objection so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned, to petroleum Concessions Ltd. applying to the Sheikh of Bahrein (at the appropriate time) for a concession over the two areas indicated in the maps attached to the draft concession which you left here on the 31st March. 2. As your Company understands, there is a possibility that the Sheikh of Qatar might wish to advance claims to certain of the islands, reefs or shoals, and if he should do so such claims would have to be considered by His Majesty's Government with a view to reaching a decision. 3. It should also be clearly understood that any decision subsequently taken with regard to the sovereignty or/ S.H. Longrigg, Esq., petroleum Concessions Ltd., City-Gate House, Pinsbury Square, E.C.2.,or ownership of any of the islands, reefs or shoals included in the proposed concession areas will only hold good to the extent that His Majesty's Government are in a position to take and enforce a decision, i.e. as between one protected state and another, and cannot he held to preclude His Majesty's Government from admitting the sovereignty of any foreign Power which may hereafter put forward a claim to the islands, reefs or shoals if His Majesty's Government in their sole discretion think it expedient to admit that claim. U- With regard to the definition of the proposed concession areas we think that as the boundary limits which are defined 'by the geographical co-ordinates in Article 1 of the draft lease clearly go round the Hawar group of islands it would he advisable in present circumstances to avoid mentioning these islands by name. 5» We are also of opinion that it would be better to substitute 'submerged land' for 'waters' in the suggested definition. We are advised that, so far as the water is concerned, the position is that not only does the Sheikh have no right over water outside the three mile limit, but also in the ordinary way he cannot acquire by occupation or prescription any sovereignty over such water3. rv. •c u ■but that on the other hand as regards the sea hed and tne land under the sea^ although the Sheikh has at present no right to such land outside the three mile limit, it is recognised that the 'bed of the sea and the land under it is capable of acquisition by occupation beyond the three mile limit. 6. In the light of the foregoing we suggest that the relevant parts of Article 1 of the draft concession should be reworded as follows:- PIRoTLY:- The whole of that portion of the Sheikh's Dominions (Leased Area No.l) including all tne islands, reefs, shoals and submerged land belonging to the Sheikh comprised between... » » s s 'SECONDLY:- The whole of that portion of the Shexkh's Dominions (Leased Area No.2) including all fcne islands, reefs, shoals and submerged land belonging to the Sheikh within the following boundary limits ' /.

Our Managing Director, Mr. Skliros, is going out to Baghdad in a week or ten days, and while in Baghdad he proposes to make an occasional -crip to Bahrain in connection with certain negotiations which may then be in progress. He could probably secure a seat on the Imperial Airways plane from Baghdad to Bahrain without any difficulty, but equally probably he would find it impossible to get a seat for the return journey from Bahrain to Baghdad because so many people will be flying home from India and Persia about that time. In the circumstances he is very anxious to obtain permission to use one of our own planes to take him from Baghdad to Bahrain and back from Bahrain to Baghdad, as occasion may arise. The plane he would use would be a twin engine Dragon Rapide owned by the Iraq Petroleum Transport Co.Ltd., and of British registration. These planes are piloted and serviced by Imperial Airways 7 pilots and engineers and they fly regularly on the Company's business in Palestine, Trans Jordan and Iraq* It would be equipped with wireless.

Dated, May 7 — 1938 R/Awal 7, 1357 C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire. C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I am instructed by His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., to forward to you the enclosed note of the terms under which His Highness is prepared to grant oil concessions over the unallotted area of his dominions to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and the Petroleum Concessions Limited, together with plans and schedules pertaining to the areas. &lt; 2. The plans are not exact, the points will have to be correctly plotted and described on admiralty charts. Regarding the area for the Bahrain Petroleum Company: this will include the pipe line and terminus off Sitra island which is not at present shown on available charts. The exact position of the reef off the extreme southern end of Bahrain island is also uncertain, so the two points in that neighbourhood are liable to some —some slight alteration. The reef will be included in the Bahrain Petroleum Company's area. 3. The concession to the Bahrain Petro leum Company will be an extension of the company's existing lease and all conditions in the exist ing lease will apply to the additional area except where conditions are modified or enlarged accord ing to the enclosed schedule.. 4. The new concession to the Petroleum Concessions Limited will be in the form of the 1937 draft lease for Bahrain which was handed to the Bahrain Government a year ago with the addi tion of certain clauses and changes which are shown in the schedule. 5. His Highness has given special consi deration to the possibility of the Petroleum Concessions Limited, in the event of their dis covering oil, requiring a site for an oil refinery and storage tanks. The only available land area which they will obtain is the HalaR group of islands which are surrounded by shallow seas. It is therefore suggested that the company shall be permitted to erect an oil refinery and storage tanks on Muharraq island, although this island will fa^(£ to the share of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The area would be allocated by the Bahrain Government after consultation with the British Government and consideration of the require ments of existing and future aerodromes. 6. His Highness wishes to prevent oil, which may be found in the area to be granted to the —the Petroleum Concessions Limited, being piped across to Qatar where possibly a refinery might be made. To achieve this object he has inserted a clause restricting refining Bahrain oil in i4atar„ 7, There has already been cause in Bahrain to suggest possibility of labour trouble between the two companies, a clause has therefore been inserted governing the conditions under which one company may employ persons who have been in the employment of the other company. His Highness is very anxious to avoid possible friction between the two companies. 8. His Highness last year refused to allow his hunting island, Om al Nassan, to be included in any concession. He now agrees to it being included in the Bahrain Petroleum Company's area with the proviso that no work is to be done there except with his specific permission. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Dear Sir, jv:f^ The Adviser and I had our third discussion regarding the Additional Area this morning. Mr, L.N.Hamilton was also present. The offer which I made during my second discussion with the Adviser, and which is set forth in my letter No, PA/15&amp; of April 2nd to you, was amplified and extended during this morning's dis cussion so that the offer now embraces the following points. that, if His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa al- Khalifah, K.C.I.E,, C.S,!., will grant to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited an oil con cession covering the Additional Area, that is to say all the territory under the dominion of His Highness (including territorial waters), other than that which has been selected by my Company under the terms of the present Mining Lease, such concession to be under the terms and conditions of the present Mining Lease except as to the following obligations which my Company is prepared to undertake with respect to the additional area: 1. My Company will pursue, with diligence and without unnecessary delay, geological work including structure drilling and geophysical work if necessary; 2. If a favourable area is found by Company will drill a test well and if sufficient oil should be discovered to justify my company in drilling further wells, such drilling will be continued until oil in commercial quantities has been obtained, or until the area is no longer deemed a favourable one. 3, My Company will pay His Highness Rs 100,000/- upon the granting of such concession and a further sum ofRs300,000/- upon the disco very of oil in commercial quantities. In view of our previous discussion about the meaning of our term 'Commercial quantities' I suggested, for the further assurance of His Highness, that my Company would be pre pared to accept a provision stating in effect that as soon as a well, or wells, had been drilled capable of producing, m accordance with gooa oil field practice, a daily average of a fixed amount, say 500 tons, of oil, it would be deemed that oil has been found in commercial quantities. 4, Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities my Company will continue drilling with at least one string of tools until a sufficient number of wells have been drilled within —within the productive area to meet the requirements of good oil field practice, it being understood, however, that this obligation may be suspended curing such time^as the wells then drilled are capable of a total daily average production or at least 1000 tons of oil: 5. Commencing with the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities the royalties received by His Highness shall not be less k -&lt; than at the rate or Rs 50,000/- each year. The above offer relates to all of the Mditional Area, but in view of His Highness's insistance upcm reserving the use of the Island of Umm al Hassan it is understood that the Company may not drill upon that island without first obtaining the consent of His Highness. The form of the concession, of course, will be subject to the approval of the parties concerned« Yours very truly. Sd/ H.A,Skinner. Countersigned: Sd/ C. Dalrymple Belgrave.

It will be noted that Muharraq Island is at least as well, if not better, situated than an xmarea near Budaiyah in relation to the Islands and ••submerged lands* over which the concession is offered to Petroleum Concessiona Limited. need only remark further that the actual location of the surface rights area must necessarily be selected after juouutiticxg consultation with the Air Officer Coiamanding, British yoroes in Iraq, in order to ensure that there should be no interference with the Royal Air force landing ground . Highness* 'ternas* contain a provision designed to prevent labour disputes between the two companies { cf. Additional Articles to both Schedules ) and it seems necessary also to draft a clause with the object of obviating saoh disputes as might arise sere either company to attempt to exercise one of the 'non-eKclusive' rights in the territory of the other, e.g. by building a road, constructing a harbour and so on. on this point in particular the advice of the Petroleum TJepartraent is solicited, &lt;3 * In rqnur*to the financial terms applicable to the two concesiions offered I have no particular conrnenta to make. It is true that rupee figures tend to sound more impressive thanthan in fact thay are and if Mil Highneag* daraanaa for yayaienta prior to the time wlaen royalt ie« become operatiire are converted into sterling it will, I thinlc, be considered that they are not excessive, particularly for areas so closely adjacent to a proTed oil field. 3, The period allowd before drilling operations must coiomence isay be considered soraewhat brief, but in practical f/ effect either company should be able without undue difficulty to comply with them; and it would, in my opinion, be not only improper in respect of His Highness* interests but also highly undesirable in respect of the desiderata of His ijsjesty's Government, to urge on His Hig'oness an extension of the period which he lays down. In other words, if drilling is while In either of the concessional areas it can and should begin within the period stated. 8. In regard to paragraph 3 of your telegram i agree that some warning trhould be conveyed to the Shaikh of Bahrain in regard to possible claims by other Rulers or Powersto parts of the concession areas now under consideration. I must, however, enter a protest against the sugtestion that the claims of a foreign Power might be admitted by His Majesty's Government if it were thought expedient to do so. I suggest that expediency should play no part in the determination of a foreign claim to territory already claimed by the Shaikh of Bahrain and that such claims should be decided only on their merits. If therefore a sommunication in the sense suggested is to be conveyed to the Shaikh of Bahrain it should be to the effect that claims by foreign Powers or other lihaikhs to parts*4/ of the conoasaional areas must be considered and decided by Jll# Eajeety's SoTernraent on their .uerita.

The Hon.Lt.Colonel Sir T.C.W.Fowle, KCIE.,CBE., H.B.M.'s Consulate-General, Bushire.1:1 PTE • Mr.Ballantjme (Bahrein Petroleum Company) called on the 6th May and, among other matters, spoke about the negotiations for the Bahrein unallotted area. He said he had heard a statement on good authority that His Majesty's Government were abandoning their attitude of Impartiality in favour of Petroleum Concessions Limited. His Company would be quite content to see no concession given for the rest of the Sheikh's territory but if one were given they were anxious to obtain the whole of the unallotted area, since they thought it would be regrettable if two companies were operating side by side in so small an area. I said that, so far as I was aware, the decision rested entirely with the Sheikh and that His Majesty's Government would not intervene if he should choose to give the whole of the unallotted area either to the Bahrein Petroleum Company or to Petroleum Concessions Limited. We had heard, however, that there was a possibility that the Sheikh, who we thought was in no hurry to give a concession at all, might decide to divide the unallotted area between the two Companies. i .lr.Ballantyne suggested that it would ease our difficulties in that quarter if the Hawar Islands went to Petroleum Concessions Limited. I denied that we were influenced by any such motive. I told him that in fact there was no final ruling as to the ownership of Hawar and that it was a matter of indifference to us whether the Bahrein Petroleum Company or Petroleum Concessions Limited were gi'/en a concession there* If a concession over Hawar were given to either Company it would probably be necessary to give a ruling on the question of ownership; if it should be found that the island belonged to Qatar it would presumably follow// follow that it was already included in the Petroleum Concessions Limited Qatar concession, but in our view the question of ownership would not be affected by any consideration as to which Company was given a concession professed to be relieved at this removal of his suspicion. As regards the division of the unallotted area between the two Companies I said that so far as I was aware this was an idea that the Sheikh himself had proposed. Mr.Ballantyne said he was aware that Mr.Belgrave had had this idea under examination for some time, and he believed that it had been suggested to the Sheikh a couple of years ago by His Majesty's Government. However, he seemed satisfied by what I had said and did not pursue the matter. I did not tell him that our impartiality might be modified to the extent of indicating to the Sheikh if necessary that, if His Highness wished to divide the unallotted area, such and such a division would be fair to Petroleum Concessions Limited. (I have since looked at the 193 6 papers and from Mr .Belgrave 1 s letter of 23rd September 1936 on P. Z. 68/82/36 it seems to me that Mr .Ballantyne was wrong and that the / idea of dividing the unallotted area was in fact the Sheikhas alone). it almost certainly belonged to Bahrein. In any case over Hawar 'by the Sheikh of Bahrein. Mr .Ballantyne J.P.G. 7th April 1938.NOTE. Lord Cadman telephoned me to-day to say that he had just received a telegram from Bahrein which indicated that the question of the disposal of the unallotted area had been decided by the Sheikh and t hat the Company were not t o get what the;/ wa nt ed. He said he was very disturbed about this ne%s and asked (a) whether it was true and (b) what he should do. As regards (a) I told him that we had received a telegram from Sir T^Fowle (sent from Bahrein) which seemed to donfirra the rumour that the Sheikh did intend to divide the area between .American interests and Petroleum Concessions Limited and that the division would probably give the latter substantially/ what they required. As regards (b) I said that there seemed nothing to do except to wait until the Sheikh had intimated that he was ready to re-open the discussions. a..c.b. symoit, 9th May 1938.By Air Mall. p-z-iiw 193/ INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, 1 - : nu\ Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

NOTE. The question of the future employment of Major Prank Holmes in the Persian Gulf T/as discussed at a meeting at Britannic House on the 25th April at which Lord Cadman, Mr» Eraser^ Mr, Skliros* Sir Trenchard Powle and Mr # Symon v /ere present. Mr♦ Skliros said that his understanding of his conversation with Mr # Walton on 9th December was that, while His Majests^s Government objected to the continued employment of Major Holmes on the Trucial Coast, these objections did- not apply to Bahrein and Koweit* He said that soon after his conversation with Mr. Walton lie had left for Bagdad and it was while he was there that he pursued the idea of employing Major Holmes at Bahrein in connection with the negotiations for the ^Unallotted Area s? . Pie had accordingly asked the London office of the Company to send out Major Holmes provide d he was fit and th at t he India.^„pftlce_ saji no object ion . When Major Holmes came to Bagdad he had assumed that it was with the approval of the India Office. This apparently was not the case. On learning that His Majesty T s Government were not prepared to allow Major Holmes to act on behalf of the Company at Bahrein he had immediately withdrawn Major Holmes, who since then had severed his official connection with the Company* Mr. Skliros then went on to say that because of his influence with the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Sheikh's family the Compaq were still anxious that Major Holmes should act for them in connection with the forthcoming negotiations; but if this was not acceptable to His Majesty's Government he would not press the point, and would try and tie Major Holmes up so as to prevent him from acting on behalf of their rivals. Sir Trenchard Powle then said that he could only confirm what the Company had already been told, viz. that as a/to. v a negotiator Major Holmes was persona non gra ta to His Majesty's Government; and he '.vent on to point out that if, as appeared likely, the Sheikh had already made up his mind to divide up the unallotted area between the American Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited the need for having Major Holmes on the spot would not arise, Mr, Skliros then asked whether the objections to Major Holmes applied to Koweit as v /ell as to other parts of the Persian Gulf. Pie was informed by Sir Trenchard Fowle that this point would be considered. Lord Cadman said that he was prepared to accept the position as regards Major Holmes and ?/ould not press for reasons; but, as regards what Sir Trenchard Powle had said about the Sheikh dividing up the area, it was possible that the Sheikhas ideas might fall short of what the Company wanted, and it was in this direction that personal influence with the Sheikh and his family might prove to be the decisive factor. He said the Company attached considerable importance to securing the area shown in Map 1, and leaving aside the question of obtaining oil they were most anxious to prevent their Arnerical rival from extending their influence in this direction. He therefore hoped that His Majesty's Government would see their way to influencing the Sheikh to accept their proposals. Lord Cadman was promised that his views would be submitted for consideration. As regards procedure. Sir Trenchard Powle said that nothing could be done until the Sheikh had intimated that he was ready to re-open negotiations. In reply to Lord Gadman, Sir Trenchard said that if the Company wanted to send out a negotiator from England he had no doubt that the Sheikh could be persuaded to wait until the negotiator arrived. Mr. Skliros then said that it was possible that as he was returning to Iraq, shortly he might go to Bahrein himself to conduct the negotiations personally. (Sd.)

Since lie called on tne 6th May he had tieen in Albania, and meanwhile messages nad been coming in from Bahrein to his Office indicating that, notwithstanding what had been said to him here on the 6th May, the belief persisted in the minds of his Company's representatives that His Majesty's Government had abandoned their neutral attitude and had advised the aheikhs go partition the area. He understood that in compliance with this advice the Sheikh had made proposals which had been sent to the India Office for the division of tne unallotted area. Mr. Peel and I said that so far we had received no such proposals, and that Government wore not attempting to influence the Sheikh against giving one concession for the whole area. Whether the area should be given wholly to one Company or the other or divided between them was a matter for the Sheikh to decide and His Majesty's Government's attitude thereto was neutral and unbiassed. ile added however that if the Sheikh should decide to divide (an idea which from our papers seemed to have originated with the Sheikh himself) then Government would, naturally, wish to see a reasonable partition between the two Companies. It seemed necessary to say this to Mr. Ballantyne in order to offer a possible explanation for the reports emanating from Bahrein which at the same time satisfying Mr. Ballantyne that His Majesty's Government were still genuinely neutral on the question of div ision versus a single concession for the whole area - and, in the latter case, neutral as between the Bahrein Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Mr. Ballantyne said he proposed to write at once to * Mr. Belgrave, who was a personal friend of his, telling him of/of the rumours he had received from Bahrein and of his conversations at the India Office from which he understood that Governments attitude in the matter of a simgle concession versus partition was neutral and impartial. He added that he would probably wish to follow up the letter by a personal visit to Bahrein in order to satisfy himself of the true position on the spot. If he decided to go to Bahrein he would Y /ish to call at Bushire on his way in order to talk matters over with Sir Trenchard Fowle. Sd. J.P.

The islets Ghassar Noon, A1 Hool and Ghassar Rock, to which reference is made in the boundary descriptions, are located close to the southern extremity of Bahrain Main Island, but as they lie in an area which has not yet been covered by an Admiralty Survey it is not possible to state their exact position by longitude and latitude.

I have recently had an opportunity of flying over the whole area, and the notes attached to the description are partly hased largely on observations made during that flight. It should be noted that the plans already forwarded were prepared by the Bahrain Land Department from two Admiral ty charts of different scale, that much of the southern part of the two areas has never been accurately surveyed a nd that the plans therefore are not more than moderately accurate. At one or two points the Land Department has indicated the existence of islands or reefs where the Admiralty charts show only variations in depth of water.

To Political Resident, Bushire. No. 98 . Dated 23rd May 1938. Bahrain Unallotted Area. Yesterday Thornberg indiEated to I second oil company obtained a concession in Bahrain his own Company might be c ompelled to c oncentrate on their Saudi properties to the detriment of Bahrain production. 2. I saw him today. He told me he had had communication from London informing him that disposal of Unallotted Area was a purely commercial affair in which political considera tions had no weight and in which His Majesty's Government would not interfere, (cf. correspondence resting with India Office Printed letters Nos. P.Z.3234 dated the 14th May and -f / (&gt; 4- the 17th May). This being so his Company would treat it as such and following were main considerations: (1) The Bahrain Petroleum Company, i.e. Galtex, had contemplated considerable expansion of activities in Bah rain, involving the expenditure of millions of dollars, on production and refinery of oil from deep horizon here now practically certain, plus refinery in Bahrain of crude oil from Saudi Arabia. He hinted that his Company would regard advent of second oil company in Bahrain territories as so damaging to their interests that it might cause complete revision of this programme, slowing down of Bahrain produc tion and concentration on ascertained and expected resources in Saudi Arabia, (cf. paragraph 49 of my Intelligence Sum- . ^ p mary No. 8 of 1938). (2) His Company have good reason to believe that Petro leum Concessions Limited's main object in applying for part/- f ielgrave that if-2- part or whole of Unallot.t.ad Area was 'to creat.e nuisance value and not to develop oil. They knew that Anglo-Iranian Oil Com pany could vastly increase output at Abadan by merely opening valves and they deduced that Petroleum Concessions L-jmited's bid for Bahrain was therefore mainly for above purpose or altamatively for possible reserve. In either event the Shaikh of Bahrain could not expect active production by them beyond minimum required under terms of concession. (3) To his own Company the Unallotted Area was worth im mensely more than it was last year (a) for keeping out compe titor companies seeking for nuisance value and (b) for poten- tial development in sea area on a line betv/een deep horizons recently proved at l)amman and now almost certain in Bahrain, and possibly between Bahrain end structurally hopeful Qatar. Even though his Company had markets in the East for greatly increased oil shipments from Persian Gulf (b) was of less immediate importance than (a) and his Company would pro bably increase last year's offer several fold even if they were not allowed to develop Additional Area. 3. In these circumstances and if this were purely a com mercial af 'air between the Shaikh and the Companies he thought that the Shaikh should at least know what he stood to gain or lose. I was unable to induce him to define exactly how Petro leum Concessions Limited would create nuisance value even after a fairly definite hint regarding proposed allotment of Manamah Island. 4. I have insufficient knowledge of world-wide actions and reactions betv/een major oil companies to be able tto judge how seriously Caltex might view the advent of Petroleum Con cessions Limited to Bahrain, or how genuine the scarcely- veiled threat to transfer major activities from Bahrain to Arabia may be. But Thornberg showed me a sketch map indicat ing locationJelected for Refinery near Jubail north of Has Tanura/-Tanura on main land and indicated that this was v/here d fevelop- ment v/ould come in conjunction with field explored near Abu Hadriyah if his Company 'lost confidence in Bahrain'. 5. In these circumstances I request instructions what com munication, if any, should be made to the Shaikh of Bahrain. The whole thing may be a bluff, for it is difficult to believe that Caltex would fail to utilise fully and immediately for revenue purposes their field and refinery assets in Bghrain On the other hand the stakes are so Immense that it may be best to inform the Shaikh of the gist of this conversation and leave him to decide whether to stick to his present pro- posal or to open an optj-oEi for the whole Unallotted Area# - Political -Telegram 'Q* From Political Resident, Bushire.

Brenan, Esq., O .B .E. , Foreign Office. 'be/ E,A.Seal, Esq., ; ; Admiralty, P.O.Starling, Esq., Petroleum Department.'be that his objections to the idea of division will be appreciably reduced when he learns that it is proposed to divide the area in a way that, save for surface rights on Muharract, will not give Petroleum Concessions a footing on the main islands and v/ill presumably prevent drilling operations by Petroleum Concessions Limited interfering in any way with Bapco's fields. If, therefore, the Departments concerned concur in principle in the Sheikh's proposals we would propose, as soon as instructions have been sent to the Resident, to let both Companies in London know what the Sheikh has in mind. I should add, with reference to Ballantyae's points, that we do not ourselves think that his Company has any claim to priority in respect of the unallotted area. Indeed the ball was set rolling by petroleum Concessions Limited over two years ago and Bapco showed not a little hesitation in joining in. In the matter of unneighbourly relations it is probable that, as suggested above, Ballantyne will admit that his objections lose much of their force in the light of the Sheikh's scheme of division. Moreover the draft concession proposed by Petroleum Concessions Limited (of which we still lack spare copies) contains3. provisions for the protection of the rights aoove and below ground of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As it appears that Ballantyne may be s at any rate partially5 under a misapprehension as to the position and as to what the Sheikh has in niindj we should be glad to be able to inform powle that we have no objection in principle to the division which the Sheikh proposes to offer to the companies5 and so be in a position to let the latter know informally of His Highness's intentions. Seal and Starling, I am sending a similar letter to Brenan and Starling, Brenan and Seal, Yours sincerely. (8gd.) j. p. gibsonjfl Bahrein Unallotted Area. / ^ Mr.Ballantjme called again to-day. He had already been told that since his visit on the 13th May we had learnt of the proposals which the Sheikh had in mind in connexion with the unallotted area. He said he was increasingly anxious and disturbed at the prospect offered by the reports he had been receiving regarding the division of the area. His points were :- (a) The Sheikh had said it was his own wish to give the whole of the area to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. He had said this to Mr.Thornberg, an American engineer who is a director of the Ccmpany. Mr.Thornberg had an understanding with the Political Agent that he would not talk business with the Sheikh, but naturally he had social intercourse with the Sheikh and his family and could not prevent the Sheikh from expressing opinions to him. Hence the Company's officials in Bahrein were convinced that, if it were not for pressure from other quarters, the unallotted area would be given entirely to 'Bapco'. I repeated that no pressure was being exerted from here and that in any of the papers I had read I had not seen anything to confirm that the Sheikh's own wish was to give the unallotted area to the Bahrein Petroleum Company only. (b) Mr.Ballantyne said his Ccmpany considered they had a priority in the negotiations for the additional area. They were being kept out of the Trucial Coast and the Aden Protectorate on the ground that another Ccmpany had entered the field first, and they would feel they had a real grievance if they were not given the benefit of the priority they claimed at Bahrein. (c)/(c) He felt it would be a gra,ve mistake to allow a second ccmpany to operate in so small an area; the intrigu and confusion it would cause would te intolerable. This objection. would not apply to conceding the Hawar group to Petroleum Concessions Limited, but it certainly would in the event of Petroleum Concessions Limited being admitted to the Bahrein archipelago. Mr.Ballantyne professed to be very suspicious of the French influence in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and feared that such a 'cosmopolitan crowd' would be a source of trouble in Bahrein. As an example of the trouble that would follow if Petroleum Concessions Limited were admitted close to the Bahrein Petroleum Company he said that a member of Petroleum Concessions Limited has asserted that when they got their concession fram the Sheikh they would drive a well at an angle in order to tap the Bahrein Petroleum Company's oil sources. Mr.Ballantyne said this device was not unknown in oil practice but had been made illegal under American law. (d) .Finally he said he would be glad if it were possible to delay any decision for a week or so, in order to gite/him an opportunity to develop an idea which had occurred to him as offering a solution which would, he thought, be acceptable both to His Majesty's Government and to his Company. On being asked what the idea he said he could only speak unofficially at present as he did not know whether his plan would find support. It was, that the unallotted area should be given to a new company formed from a canbination, which might be in a fifty fifty proportion, of the American operating interests with English financial interests. I said that, putting aside the objection/objection that the suggestion presupposed that we were able to dictate to the Sheikh how the concession should be given, I did not understand why it was thought that the Bahrein Petroleum Company would receive less support from His Majesty's Government than a company formed in accordance with Mr.Ballantyne's suggestion. Mr.Ballantyne apparently thought that the 'Red Line agreement' was operating to the prejudice of his company and that His Majesty's Government objected to any further extension of purely American interests in Bahrein. I said I knew of nothing to support this view; any proposal for dividing the area came from the Sheikh himself and was not the outcone of any prejudice on the part of His Majesty's Government against the Bahrein Petroleum Company. I said finally that I could do no more than report Mr.Ballantyne's views for consideration before any decision was taken here. J. P.

As first step I consider Shaikh should be advised that in the light of new situation his best course would appear to be to elicit the views of the two Companies on his scheme. For this purpose he should as a first step put his original proposals as to a method of geographical division (irrespective of question of financial terms) in writing (through Political Agent) to each Company as a scheme of limits which he is prepared to consider and ask for their views and offers in writing (through Political Agent). This besides clearing up any misapprehension which may exist on the part of the Bahrain Petroleum Company as to area offered to them will elicit a clear statement of any objections they have to it and any alternative they have to suggest. On receiving the replies of the two Companies Shaikh can consider matter further. 3. If you see no objection please instruct Political Agent to advise Shaikh as in preceding paragraph and report result by telegram. If Shaikh acts on it we shall be in a better position on receipt of the replies of the two Compa- * nies to decide(?) what further advice to give him. 4.

He now feels that in new situation his Company has been considerably handicapped by absence of a negotiator with knowledge of local personalities during last few months, 3. .Whatever substance there may be in his representations we teel it is in any case desirable in new circumstances to allow Company to the latter the negotiator whom they think most suitable in their own interests (viz. Holmes) unless you consider it vital from Government's point of view to maint_ain our objection to him on account of special activi ties directly detrimental to our interests. Our objection was based on general risk of confusion and intrigues and on his activities on Trucial Coast. So far latter may have been open to objection from point of view of Government interests (as distinct from those of Company) we suggest there may be much -much less risk at Bahrain than on the Truclal Coast where supervision Is out of question. therefore you agree we would propose In new circumstances which have arisen to In form Company of our rendlnes? to withdraw our objections to Holmes.

BAHREIN UNALLOTTED AREA, Mr. Ballantyne called this afternoon to speak about a Cable he had received from Bahrein. In it Mr. Thornberg said he had been told by one of the Sheildily family that the Sheikh wanted to give the whole of the area to the Bahrein petroleum Company but was afraid that he would be punished, if he did so, by the loss of Hawar^ Mr. Ballantyne said that to his mind the Sheikh's fear was fantastic but he wanted our assistance in dispelling it. It was clear enough that he hoped to receive an explicit denial which he would transmit as from the India Office, but his specific suggestion was that we might report the matter to the Resident and get him to tell the Sheikh through the Political Agent that his fear of being penalised by the loss of Hawar was quite unfounded. I said I thought that in the circumstances it would be best if the matter were cleared up locally with the Political Agent either by the Sheikh or his relatives or by Mr. Thornberg. The Political Agent, after all, was immediately concerned in the negotiations, and he was in the best position to give an effective answer to the Sheikh or his relatives, whom of course he knew well. Mr. Ballantyne appeared to be disappointed but he agreed that it would be best to take the matter up with the Political Agent. (It may be that one of his reasons for showing no enthusiasm for the suggestion is his reluctance to disclose the name of Mr. Thornberg's informant, as it was for this reason that he did not show me the actual telegram which he had with him). Before/Before 1 e av i ng ? Mr # Bal 1 antyxie me nt i one d t hat lii s Company had .had another letter from the Sheikh of Ahu Dhabi, who was anxious to treat with the Company and professed to be completely freed from any obligations to Government. The Sheikh had been given a similar answer to the reply given him last year, to the effect that the Company were not at present in a position to discuss matters with him. But Mr. Ballantyne added that his Company might before very long wish to enter into negotiations with the Sheikh, though of course before they did so they would come and discuss matters with us. ■ He said that Abu Dhabi objected to Petroleum Concessions Limited because of the political obligations with which a concession given to them would be tied up.Awali, Bahrain. ^Tune 5th, 1938. Dear Belgrave, As I hay© indioatad previously we are not interested In Hawar as a proaising place to find oil, hut rather to protect our present heavy investment and our plans for the future against possible disturbance from having a rival concessionaire in this small sheikhdom. Last year me offered &amp;8.100,000 cash, and Hs.300,000 if oil were found in coBaaercial quantities. Now we are prepared to offer this entire aasount. Re.400,000 in cash for the entire '•additional area'. Enough has been aaid, I think, to inform you fully as to our reasons for believing that we should not be forced to share the remaining area with a rival who has played no part in the development of Bahrain's prosperity, and who comes in now with everything to gain and nothing to lose. I have expressed to you the opinion that no experienced oil company would see in Hawar Island even a fair prospect for comrercial oil development. On the face of it this opinion is worth less as evidence concerning the actual presence or ab sence of oil. It does lead to another thought however. You have said that you believe that our rivals want Hawar because of its oil possibilities. Is it not then, if it is to be denied to us, to require that it be prospected immediately by those to whom it is given, and demonstrated by them to be commercially productive, or relinquished to us so that at least from then on we can feel free to proceed with our own developments here without the threat of a potentially disruptive influence hanging over us. Certainly while such a threat exists it will be reflected in our own commercial policies here. You have been made acquainted with conversations between both Sheikh Hamad and Sheikh Abdullah, and our selves, within the past few days, and with their statements that except for certain apprehensions on their part they would retain us sole concessionaires within this Sheikhdom, 'hat ground they may have for such apprehensions is neither within our knowledge nor our province to inquire - although in view of contrary assurances we have received from The India Office sons curiosity on our part might be excused. However If, for reasons of State, His Highness decides that Hawar must be awarded to our rivals, surely the soleJune 5th, 1938 aim which need be recognized on their part is the development of oil if it be present; and our request that the presence of oil be de tens in ad proinptly, or the area assigned to us as protection against recurring troubles, seems a reasonable one. I know that the day you have set for leaving here is very near and I shall do everything possible to avoid any delays on our part in connection with this matter. Plesse consider that my time is completely at your own disposal until this business is closed. Youre sincerely, Original signed by Max Thornburg.No. -1^ of 1357 Office of the Adviser to the Government. Bahrain, Dated. R/Thany 9. 1357 June 8, 1938 From To C.

His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. v ' j Dear Sir, i I tiave received your letter dated 8 June, 1958 on the subject 'Bahrain Unallotted Area', together with its attachments, inviting my Company's' views on the scheme proposed by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and an offer in regard to financial terms. These matters have received consideration by my Company and I have to reply as follows- My Company is shocked to read the proposal which appears to be under consideration, as described in this correspondence. If after more than 6 years of tremendously hard work on our part, and harmonious and profitable cooperation betv/een us. His Highness now wishes not only to bring our rival into his Shaikhdom but to offer that rival three Quarters of his Shaikhdom, it seems that what we can write on paper during this last hour is of little importance. believe we have already written it better in the great oil field and refinery operations around his new city Awali, and in the abundant prosperity of his Shaikhdom, and in the happy faces of his people. However, since we are now asked to name the amount of money which we are prepared to pay to continue our development within his Shaikhdom, 1 and the terms which would be acceptable to us, we request that His Highness be advised as follows; My Company is prepared to pay His Highness Es.400,000 upon the granting of a concession covering all territory, including waters, under the dominion of His Highness^ other than that already held by my Company under its present Mining Lease. It is my Company's intention that its present Mining Lease would be extended to cover the 'Unallotted Area' to which the present offer pertains, except for certain modifications applying specifically to the 'Unallotted Area'. These modifications would embrace the following points, details concerning which would be arranged to the satisfaction of both parties: My Company would carry out geological work making use of the most modern scientific methods ap plicable, including the drilling of structure wells;- 2 - 8 June, 1938 His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. drill test wells for oil wherever geological evidence warranted; continue drilling further wells, if oil should be discovered, until oil in commercial quantities (daily average of 500 tons with good oil field practice) has been obtained or until the area is no longer deemed favourable; and, upon discovery of oil in commercial quantities, continue drilling within the productive area until the requirements of good oil field practice have been met, this obligation however being subject to sus pension during such time as wells then drilled are capable of a total daily average of at least 1000 tons of oil. My Company would also agree to substantially increased obligations on its part for additional drilling within the area now covered by its present Mining Lease, including more wells to the present main pay, more wells to the newly discovered deep zone if coibmercial produc tion is developed there, and resumption of drilling in our Deep Test to determine what possibilities exist at even greater depths than we have now explored. My Company would also guarantee a minimum royalty of Rs.50,0p0 per year from the 'Unallotted Area' commencing with the date of discovery of oil in commer cial quantities, and would be willing to discuss the matter of substantially increasing the minimum royalty now established for the area now covered by its present Mining Lease, My Company wishes now to point out to His Highness its reasons in brief, for objecting to a rival oil company entering this Shaikhdom: Peace and prosperity can be enjoyed only where there is trust and security. We have had all these in Bahrain. They cannot be found in any other country in this entire part'of the world. We ask His Highness to look about and say if this is true. We ask His Highness to say what part we have had in making it true. To answer this it is better to look at our years of work than to read what we might write now on paper. -? With a strong ri yaT in this Shaikhdom we would not feel safe. Trust and'security would' be gone. We do not mean that our rivals are wicked, but only that they are rivals. When we are alone or with our friends in our own house we go-about our affairs in security and think only of doing our duties well. But if a rival comes into the house we have only one eye and v one hand for our family and friends, and keep one eye and one hand ready to guard ourselves if necessary. His Highness may ask what our rivals might do to bother us. We can only- 3 - 8 June, 1938. His Britannic Majesty's Political .Agent, Bahrain. answer that our Company comes from the oldest oil company in the world, and it has learned by much ezperience that the greatest dangers to any company are the things a rival can-do, when both want something which only one can have. During the past two years, while we have been developing markets in many countries, for Bahrain oil, we have found our road blocked in many ways,and have been forced to fight our way step by step. If His Highness wishes this to be repeated here in his own. Shaikhdom we cannot prevent it, but until, it is done we can urge against it. After it has been done all we can do is look out for ourselves. 4 j Jy If someone suggested to His Highness that a strong rival Shaikh be invited to move i in with his people, the dangers would be recognized inmediately. A large Company with a tremendous outlay of money and plans for a long future to'protect, will see the same thing. A rival outside the house is merely a rival, but when the door is opened for him to come in and step between friends he becomes a danger, and the smaller the house the greater the danger. His Highness may wish to know what effect the presence and possible activities of a 1 rival would have upon our plans. We can say only that, with due regard for our obligations as set down in the concession agree ment, we would adopt new plans based upon the changed situation. Under any circumstances, however, His High ness may be assured that we shall faithfully discharge every obligation put upon us by our concession agreement. More than thait we cannot say. Because we know that it has been discussed by others, my Company wishes to say plainly here that it is a British corporation, paying British tazes, employing largely British, subjects,, and cooperating most whole heartedly with His Britannic Majesty's government in all ways which are possible; and that it has been assured that its efforts in this direction have been recognised and are appreciated. Our capital is American. We neither deny it nor cover it up. ' No third foreign country owns any part of our company. My Company wishes to point out that the demand for oil to supply^its present markets cannot nearly be met from its present production at Bahrain,, and that it is forced to buy very large quantities of products to supply its own customers. Under these circumstances my Company points out that its own search for crude oil can not be looked upon as a move merely to secure a reserve source of supp^, to be used when and if its ordinary source of supply is cut off, for example in the event of- 4 - 8 June, 1938. His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. war. Also it points out that it lias a large and modern refinery, an excellent shipping terminal, an established operating organisation and a well developed living com- munity already available for refining and shipping any additional oil that may be discovered within this Shaikh- dom. My^Company suggests that all these circumstances be taken into account when comparing the probability, between two companies, of actively developing a new oil field here. My Company was asked to state its views con cerning the proposal presented by His Highness, and to make an offer in regard to financial terms. Both these instructions have been complied with here. In presenting these views we have emphasized the importance to us of avoiding a conflict between two large oil com panies within this shaikhdom. We wish to point out that the very substantial increase in our present cash offer oyer the one of a year ago represents the price we are willing to pay for the privilege, which it now seems we must buy, of working in peace and harmony instead of in conflict. Division of the area wipes out this value. Trusting that the foregoing statement will give His Highness the information he seeks, I am Yours faithfully.

Now, at relatively much less expense, we could expand these basic facilities to accoMsadate increased operations, if any bacose possible, and enjoy an ultimate economy to offset our rather excessive initial outlay. .3 She advantages of our own work — in demonstrating productivity of certain geological zones, in de veloping drilling methods, in training local labor, in bringing now and worldwide shipping lines into Bahrein, in promoting the growth and utility of auxiliary services such aa'ajerohants, transportation, and contributing to the social and industrial welfare of the people and to the assimilation of ideas be tween two widely different cultures will inevitably be reaped by viiomever proceeds from this point with generally similar operations. that this should be so Inheres in the situation and is not contingent upon who proceeds with the work nor upon the terms of any formal agreement, A In addition to our capital outlay on Bahrein Islsnd itself, and to oar other development activities there, we have — during the last two years — made the name Bahrein known, and favorably, throughout the entire world; and have made a capital outlay of millions of pounds in distributing and marketing facilities, including large and thoroughly modern tankshlps — one of which bears the name 'BAHRiSIH'. The foundation of this tremendous enterprise was a limited proven production from the first Bahrein structure, and our faith in our ability to supplement this by further production from yet undiscovered fields as that first production normally declines. .8 We have been lead to believe, by tbose competent to make such an expression, that we enjoy a preferential right over other applicants in re spect of the 'Additional Area', and that this- 2 - preferential rlgbt was reoogclzed and aocep ad by those eon^eteot to give effect to itj and oar own eonduet of negotiations looking toward extend ing oar present concession bas been based upon this understanding. That this is so has been well known by wt i those closely concerned with the natter and is further evidenced by our complete aquiescence to the Bahrein Governimnt' b request of about one year ago that we do not press our application until again invited to do so — eren though it has been well known to us that coapetitiTe interests have hot shown the same consideration. To learn now that in the final hearing we should be denied the weight we already have gained, and be placed in an even balance against a newcomer, would indeed be a rude shock. Bahrein Government has no apparent reason for displeasure: .1 Our Company's ability to find and produce oil speaks for itself. ,g oar Company far exceeded its contractual obligations for drilling, even during a period when most large companies were pursuing conservative policies owing to world-wide economic disturbances, and before any plans had even been formulated for providing norteal outlets through our own refining and marketing facilities. ,3 Our refinery, as to processes and equipment installed up to now, is probably the most up-to-date oil refin ery in the world. In the face of many obstacles — such as Industrial and marine strikes at home, severe climate, isolated location and untrained labor, this refinery was designed, erected and put into operation - again with untrained labor - in a time so -short that even now it is scarcely believed by thfcse unacquainted with the actual facts. We doubt if anything even approaching this can be found in the entire history of rival applic nts for further developments here. .4 we have observed meticulously every wish of Sheikh Hamad and of the local Government, whether contrac tual or subsequently expressed or implied by them, in respect of religious or social customs of the local people.(236 . 3 .

We have watched rival conworcial interests eater these provinoes and have assisted them with geological iaforastioa, mechanical ser vice ei^i supplies. It met be recognised that when we refrained from these negotiations we wore in far greater need of crude supplies than were our rivals, and from ooamerciel considerations alone bed every reason to consider ourselves en titled to etuai opportunity.Oar actlTities as well as oar intereats la ooanao- tion with oil ooncessioas are parely oomeroial and not at all political.

By oar respect for and cooperation with H.B.M. QoTem- aent we helieTe m hare enhanced its prestige among the non-British residents of this region, and certainly we have taken no steps to enhance oar own at its sz- liense. Nor have ws resorted to bribes, propaganda or chicanery in any form to indace any persons to act in oar interests or to sabvert those of H.B Ji. or of oar coramercial rivals. .4 We have spared no effort to learn for oarselres, and through invited coansel, the ways in which we might adapt and atilize oar facilities for the convenience of H.B.M. defense services. .5 Despite the specialized nature of oar work and the hazards of unskilled operation, we have pursued, and shall continue to pursue, a program of employment and training of British subjects to take over all positions in the organization as rapidly as competent men can be foand or trained. From many years experience in selecting and training men at home, under much more favorable circumstances, we know that this problem is iaost difficult . We know, too, that anyone acquainted with such problems will find oar plans and oar accomplish ment commendable, and will agree that uninformed insist ence on haste for haste's sake may have most serious consequence®. .6 we do not believe that any ground exists for retal iatory measures against oar interests, because of dis crimination against British oil companies in oar own country, as in fact such companies operate on equality with oar own, as is well known. 4.0 a are better prepared than any others to continae development in Bahrein.! ,1 As a result of more thro 6 years of continuous geological investigation and development of production in this locality, we have a knowledge of subsurface conditions, drilling methods and measures necessary for safeguarding the oil reserves, which cannot even bo approached by any others at this time, and not at any time until similar experience hers has been had by them-m over a long period. 1M,1» we heve assisted others by supplying information along these lines, such willingness on our part cannot las taken as the equivalent of years of actual trial and error on their own part. .2 We haw already on the ground as a going oonoern a complete organization of men and equipment, readily aTellable with only minor supplementing to undertake geological, geophysical, production, refining, shipping, and general administrative work essential to the testing and full development of the region. No other concern has, or can possibly have, an organ ization to compare with this one until it has been developed here as this one has. .3 The most trying and hazardous stage In the develop ment of a new undertaking such as ours here, occurs during its first few years while It is learning and adjusting Itself to the social, political, religious and eomaerclal economies of a particular iheijshdom; and the wishes, policies and even fancies of a par ticular Sheikh and his people. These things, while of the utmost importance, are only vaguely indicated in the beginning and are learned only through ex perience within the Sheikhdom. Most Important of all is the development of mutual confidence, which - between peoples of widely differing racial, cultural and. religious backgrounds - is at bast a fragile thing. Adjustments have been necessary on both sides. Mis understandings have developed and been cleared away. Untruths have been whispered, and brought into the light. We admit freely that Sheikh Hamad has earned and won our confidence and respect, and we believe - and shall not readily change our view - that we have his. Certainly no other applicant can put forward mora than rhetorical evidence in prediction of a similar harmony, and scarcely even this without at the sacie time pointing out the hazards of introducing an entirely new system of policies, practices and relationships into a Sheikhdom which has, with patience and difficulty, hardly yet completely assimilated the first. 5.0 The Additional Area should not be divided; ,1 While the speculations of daymen regarding the presence or absence of oil in an untested area is valueless, the experienced judgment of specialists based upon expert examination and correlation with adjacent formations, thoroughly known to them,.st - 6 - mist tea recognized as, at least, the best guide we can hare short of actually drilling. Based upon such experienced judgment our opinion is that the Additional Area holds little proaise of deTelopoant ' into a Taluable oil producing region. To us, however, who have already spent Tast sums of money, years of time, and endless effort on the part a great organ isation both at home and here, toward the deTelopaent of a permanent institution of which the physical, the commercial and the human dimensions have been equally problems and are equally vital to its continued success, the fringe of this Sheikhdom possesses a value which it cannot on any legitimate ground have for any other commercial interest. We do not deny, in fact we assert, that another such interest inter posing its influence between the Sheikh and ourselves might easily bring our presently harmonious relation ship to a state permitting the third party to dominate through exercise of a balancing power. We think we might almost say that, taking all eireumstanees into account, we see no other reason why such a third Interest would seek a foothold in this Sheikhdom. Certainly it is the chief reason for us objecting to one coming in. from this point of view the extent of such a third party holding is of no consequence. fo whatever extent it may be argued that a rival applicant is interested in oil production alone, we point out that a survey of the present holdings of our rival interests in the countries bordering the Persian Gulf, both developed and undeveloped, leaves little ground for giving the argument weight, or for supposing that a program of development in an area promising relatively so little, would be pro secuted beyond the absolute minimum forced upon them by contract. mile possibly only of indirect concern to us, we call attention to the unquestionable fact that the development of an oil concession, particularly in this part of the world, imposes a very real burden upon the Ruler and his Govermaent, and would, in this instance, necessitate not merely a repetition of assimilating a new institution into the Sheikhdom, but doing it under conditions charged with the conflict of external Interests. The stakes involved in this issue between our rivals and ourselves are entirely unequal. After many years of supposedly successful and widely publicized operations in this small and hitherto little-knownSheikhdom, if w« were now forced to share its develop ment with another oil company the erent would not pass unnoticed anywhere in the oil-interested world. To beliere that this is of minor importance to us is to disregard entirely its signifioanoe. This stake cannot be matched by our riTals.

Reference India Office telegram No. 1050 dated the 3rd June 1938. Bahrain Unallotted Area. 2. I returned to Bahrain by air on the 7th June 1938 and after a long interview with Mr. Skliros in the morning, I met His High ness the Shaikh of Bahrain in the afternoon. His Highness was accompanied by Shaikh Mohammad bin 'Isa, Shaikh Abdullah bin 'Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, and also by Mr. Belgrave. 3. It was evident that the Shaikhs' fear of the Bahrain Petro leum Company's hint (i.e. threat) that partition of the Unallotted Area might cause them to transfer their attention and their major operations to Saudi Arabia had not diminished, and that they were more than ever anxious to relieve their own minds by opening imme diate negotiations with the Bahrain Petroleum Company for the whole Unallotted Area minus the Hawar Islands. His Highness was in parti- cularly poor form, unable to appreciate arguments and patently eagei to be relieved of his difficulties. Indeed it was necessary to con sult the brothers and son again separately before the Adviser was able/- / i i&lt;iM g v 11' mfp—825s&amp;p—(m-1070)—14-9 34—10»000.~»3~ attitude of indifference displayed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited towards the Hawar Islands, and he and his Family feel very definitely that the allocation of Hawar to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited must involve them in unending diffi culties in future. Indeed 'both Mr. Belgrave and I have little doubt, from remarks which His Highness has passed, that he has some confused idea in his mind that the grant of a concession for Hawar to the Bahrain Petroleum Company might result in the loss of his sovereignty over that group of Islands. 6. I am submitting a further report with more detailed com ments to the Political Resident. Meanwhile I need only add that Mr. Belgrave will arrive in London about the 19th June and will call at the India Office in case his knowledge of the local back ground may be of assistance.

Dear Sir Trenchard, s 1 &gt;.ill you please refer to my express letter Mo. C/374- 10/14 dated the 10th June 1938 reporting the developments In regard to the Bahrain Unallotted Area. I have attempted to I exclude any expression of opinion from that letter t and I have omitted nueh of the detail of the negotiations of the last few days, since It seems right that these should be reported to you in the first instance and that you should decide how much or how little should be passed on. 2. I think it will be well to begin fairly far back. Hu mours of whet had occurred while you were in Bahrain soon reach ed both Packer and Thornberg and enquiries were at once afoot, ■ It was necessary for both to be informed unofficially that His Highness had formulated a certain scheme of division of his remaining territories and had asked for His Majesty's verrsment's advice on this scheme. Then followed Thornberg 1 s interviews with Belgrave and myself and I gather that some coismunicatlon In very much the same tenor was made to Shaikh / k Abdullah bin 'Isa. I must digress a little here and explain one or two points to which you refer in your telegram ifo. 206 dated the 26th May. The /•merlcnn Company had, of course, in formation of the Shaikh 's idee of division last year, but they were vehemently opposed to it as last year's comimnleations showed. Their information about Bahrain horizons is still far from complete and I regret to say that they have still to make a/- ie Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel, Sir Trenchard Powle, s^.C.I.S., C.B.ICv , • Political resident in the Persian Gulf, Buehire•mm * a real 'strike' In the lower horizon here comparable with that at Dammam. In Damraam their experimental well only came in in I,!arch and of course required weeks of testing before it could be pronounced good. Finally it a fact that they had made no approach to the Shaikh since last year's closure of negotiations up to the time that His Highness 1 proposals for partition came to us. Thus there is, I think, no parti cular deduction to be drawn from the 'timing' of their threat. 3. Again I am not sure that the Company's desire to strip Saudi Arabia of oil as fast as possible — for obvious reasons - may not be of more importance than Ibn Saud's own wishes; for the latter may find it difficult to decide whether any parti cular rate of production is or is not the maximum. Consequent ly the Company'8 good will towards Bahrain may, from this as pect of the question, be of very considerable importance. Also it is worth mentioning in this connection that the suggestion has been made to me that His Majesty's Government (i.e. the Admiralty) might themselves be glad to see Bahrain reserves maintained, while Hassa is being stripped. ( ^ 4. To return now to facts. As reported in ray telegram No. 99 dated the 28th I ay 1938, the Bapco threat had immediate results and I had to step in and tell His Highness and the Shaikhs to await His fajesty's Government's advice. While I was away on the Trucial Coast two things happened. The first was the birth of the conviction in the Bahrain Petroleum Com pany 1 s mind that the Shaikhs would give them the whole Un allotted Area if they were not frightened of His Majesty's Government's reactions. (1 think His Highness really has some confused apprehension that he might lose Hawar if he tried to give it to the Americans, but I do not think he fears any more). The second was the arrival of Skliros. He saw the/-&lt;mQm the Shaikh, and of course the report that he was quite satis fied with the offer of Hawar was totally erroneous, as you thought. In fact, from what I now hear, his interview with His Highness seems to have been a complete comedy of ndsunder- standings on both sides. 5, I got here early on the 7th and had a long interview with Skliros that morning. I was somewhat embarrassed to find / that he did not know — or pretended lie did not know — what I meant by 'the Bapco threat'; and I had to explain. I thought from paragraph 4 of India Office telegram No, 1050 of the 3rd June that lie was being informed of the whole situation. Skliros meanwhile had had a great deal to say about the damage done to his Company by the refusal to allow Holmes to come here. In the end, I think, he did see that Holmes' presence or ab sence could not have had the faintest effect, but I am sure that neither he nor his Board will ever admit this officially. His main anxiety seemed to be that he should be allowed to pre sent his Company's 1938 Draft Concession (i.e. for the A and B areas of which you know); and I informed him that I hoped he would have his opportunity inside 24 hours. I might leave the chronological order of events now for the moment and say that I had another long discussion with Skliros the same night — an exhausting affair as he is extremely deaf. By the time we finished 1 think he realised that the only effective counter to the Bapco threat was a guarantee from Petroleum Concessions Limited to the Shaikh against loss of royalties. (The posi tion seems to me that if Petroleum Concessions Limited say that the Bapco threat is bluff they must back their opinion), Nevertheless he argued that Petroleum Concessions Limited ought to have had more effective support, and an anxiety to ignore hard facts was frequently apparent. It was however possible ultimately to make him realise that much of the objection to Holmes'/-Holmes* advent here rested in the inevitable effect on the minds of those Trucial Coast Shaikhs who are holding out against his Company's offersj and 1 am glad to report that he has since written a letter to Holmes, of which I have got a copy, warning the latter to detach himself completely from Trucial Coast matters• 6. I now come to my intervl w with His Highness and his brothers and son on the afternoon of the 7th June. His High ness was, I think, feeling the heat. He was impatient, most of his remarks were beside the point, he seemed unable to appreciate the very simple advice offered him, and when he left (after being held back twice) neither Belgrave nor I was quite sure if he intended to act on Kis Majesty's Govern ment* s advice or not. He pronounced a new theory that a re finery on Muharraq Island was impossible; he thought that if Petroleum Concessions Limited could not refine on Hawer they might at least pipe their oil from that area to a submerged reef near the Fisht al Jibal ana apparently refine it thereI He assured me that Hawar was full of oil, a standing obsession with him. He then remarked that it might be better not to include the northern and western reefs in anyone's concession (this indicates some vague fear of Tbn Saud); and any way all he wanted to do was to please everyone. The other Shaikhs were obviously distressed and sent me an apolo.Ty afterwards. When they had gone Belgrave and I revised the letter which he had already composed on the lines suggested by His Majes ty's Government (in view of His Highness' expressed objection to a refinery on Juharraq we thought it better to omit mention of 'surface rights' for the time being), and early the follow ing morning Belgrave called in Shaikhs Mohammad, Abdullah and Salman to authorise him to send it. This they did, and I immediately/-immediately arranged for both Skliros and Thornberg to call on me receive this letter. I gave both of them a brief explanation of the situation and asked them to reply as soon as they possibly could. As you will have seen from their re plies both have ignored His Highness* proposals and have sub mitted their own views of v&amp;at should be done. 7. Both Companies' letters arrived before the end of the King's Birthday functions, and the Shaikhs and Belgrave began their discussions at once. I myself kept out of it except for saying that I wanted their views at once so that I could obtain His Majesty's Government's further advice for them; and I received His Highness' letter about 7 O'clock last night. 8* It is worth reporting that, irrespective of threats, the Shaikhs were not at all impressed by Petroleum Concessions Limited's offer but were favourably disposed to the Bahrain Petroleum Company's offer. So Belgreve tells me. Personally I think they are secretly relieved that in spite of the fact that the Bahrain Petroleum Company have the whip hand their offer is apparently a good deal better than that from Petro leum Concessions Limited. 9. I have reported as fully as I can the various factors which, it seems to me, have to be taken into account in assess ing how dangerous the Bapco threat is; and it is necessary also to attempt to assess the more or less indirect benefits, if any, which might result from acceptance of the Bahrain Pet roleum Company's offer. There are already very definite indi cations that the Bahrain Petroleum Company will increase their minimum royalty figure from Hs. 1A lakhs to Rs. 5 lakhs annual ly if they get the balance of the Unallotted Area^and I believe it will not be difficult to make a very good bargain with them, on/-on the liries of a fixed ratio between the quantities of Bahrain and Saudi oil to be refined here if the California Arabian Standard Oil Company can get Ibn Saud to agree to Darmam oil being refined on this Island, and the Refinary is enlarged. It seems that this latter possibility is not quite so remote as expected. The latest story is that Tbn Saud insists only on sufficient oil being refined in Saudi Arabia to meet Arabian requirements and that he does not care where the rest goes. I canhot guarantee the accuracy of this but it is borne out, up to a point, by tentative suggestions from Thornberg to Beljrave that if the Bahrain Refinery is increased to a capacity of 35,000 barrels per day — to accomwodate some Saudi Arabian oil — certain ratios might be fixed between the amounts of Bahrain and Arabian oil to be refined here. (Belgrave's understanding of the suggestion is a little too vague for me to be more particular at present). One of these factors has an almost / Ls certain credit value while the other though problematical must be taken into account. 10. The main thing, however, is the threat. We can be pretty sure that Petroleum Concessions Limited would never guarantee Bahrain against loss as a result of partition, «nri without such a guarantee or without the most excellent reasons for holding that the Bahrain Petroleum Company are bluffing it is difficult to see how His Majesty 1 s Government could advise the Shaikh to disregard this threat. It would of course be very nice to have even a half-English Company working a concession in Bahrain, but I should imagine that His Majesty's Government's main conern is that oil should be produced here, and not who should produce it, (This, of course, so long as the Company concerned is not of a hostile nationality). And except for the very strongest reasons the interests/-interests of the owners of the territory must prevail. On the other side it is easy enough to appreciete the overwhelm ing effect of the threat in a State which has risen in a matter of two years from ./rinding poverty to undreamed-rof wealth, purely as a result of the royalties which the Bah rain Petroleum Company pays. The Shaikhs see the possibi lity of a return to poverty — at a time when the pearl market is in a worse state than it has ever been; they fore see the loss of the prestige that wealth has brought to Bah rain, the end of all their schemes of development, His High ness unable to indulge his twin passions for building and for extravagant generosity, and his family deprived of their almost unlimited pocket money. Ko one can doubt that His Highness' original wish was t o discharge some part of his debt of gratitude to the British Government and to give proof of his loyalty by offering e British Company (he is unaware of the cosmopolitan composition of Petroleum Concessions Li mited) a substantial part of his territories, while at the same time 'pleasing' the American Company which had succeeded, where an English Company had failed, in providing him with great wealth. These admirable sentiments must now yield to the knife which he and his family see at their throats# 11, Hawar is a different matter. It seems impossible for the A1 Khallfah to consider Hawar without at the same time wondering how much they can annoy or perhaps damage the Al Than! of Qatar, His Highness has this absurd con viction that, whatever 'the engineers' may say, t ere is oil in Hawar, and if the Company operating in Qatar can produce oil from Hawar for Bahrain it will give him Immense, if childish, pleasure. He does not want to offer Hawar in any/--8- any case to the Americans, as I have reported officially, and the present intention is that if an agreemeat cannot be reached with iit^cPetroleum Concessions Limited then iiawar will remain outside any concession. At the same time the Shaikh seems to think that Petroleum Concessions Limited can work Hawar alone without taking any oil found into Qatar. X have told him that this is quite impossible, but so far he fails to face the fact. I dare say that in due course it will be possible to get over this difficulty. Sven so it is not entirely simple to suggest what advice should be offered to the Shaikhs. The Bahrain Petroleum Company demands the whole of the Bahrain territories, and as it stands their threat holds good if any part, even Hawar, is allotted to Petroleum Concessions Limited. However they have protested on various occasions that Hawar is of no In terest from the point of view of producing oil; and there is moreover on record the definite suggestion made by the Company's representative in London that Hawar should be given to Petro leum Concessions Limited (vide enclosure to Peel's demi-offi cial letter No. P. 2.3234/38 dated the 11th Pay 1938). On the whole I imagine His Highness would be quite safe in giving Hawar to Petroleum Concessions Limited, if they can arrange terns. Whether the Company will take it or not is another matter. ^ 15' ^ 12. Belgrave left by air this morning. He was completely exhausted and for his health's sake I did not think It advi sable to detain him any longer, especially after His Highness had said he could go. His Knowledge of local colour may pei^ haps be useful in London. Yours sincerely,-i P &gt;s . I think I Will put my last remark in a P»S, as it is so typically 'oily'. If His Majesty's Government do not prohibit the grant of most of the Unallotted Area to the Americansj they may be able to make some capital out of it in regard to the Truciel Coast - i.e# they can say to the Americans t' e did not stand in your way in Bahrain.

Bahrain i To His Britannic Majesty t s Political Agent, Bahrain, Sir I have the honour to inform you that on Monday 6th June 1938 Mr. Skliros was received by His High ness Shaikh Sir Hamad at Sakhir. Mr. Skliros was accompanied by Mr. Packer, with His Highness were Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa Alkhalifah, Shaikh Abdullah Shaikh Sulman and myself. 2» After some conversation on trivial matters His Highness introduced the subject of the additional area and invited Mr. Skliros to inform him what he had to say on the subject. Mr, Skliros stated that he had not come to discuss the matter and there was some conversation on the subject ^ Major Holmes and Mr. Packer; His Highness stated that he would willingly negotiate with either of these persons but as Mr. Skliros was present he would like him to deal with the matter. His Highness enquired whether Mr. Skliros was authorised to do so and was informed by Mr. Skliros that he had the authority to deal with and conclude the matter.3« His Highness then stated, 'very definitely, that the only area over which he was prepared to consider granting a concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited was the Hawar group of islands. The other Shaikhs took part in the conversation and all strongly emphasised this point. Mr. Skliros mentioned areas north of Muharraq_ and His Highness replied that areas anywhere else were entirely out of the question and were not for discussion. Finally His Highness asked Mr. Skliros if he vrould consider the matter and pre pare a definite offer for the Hawar group of islands. His Highness suggested that I should see Mr. Skliros and acquaint him with the matters previously discussed, about a year ago, as Mr. Skliros stated that he was not entirely conversant with the previous proceedings. Mr. Skliros then left. 4, His Highness instructed me to inform the Assistant Political Agent about the conversation at once and to explain exactly what had taken place, which I did immediately. 5, On the same day I had a meeting with Mr. Skliros and Mr. Packer, at which Mr. Skliros's Secretary was present. 6, Maps and plans were produced and there was a long discussion about previous offers and areas previously considered. Mr. Skliros decided that he could not make any definite offer until after consul- tat ion with you. He informed^that he was not aware in the morning that no conversations should be held without previous intimation from you. 7, In the morning he appeared satisfied with His Highness's suggestion that negotiations should — 3 —-3- should proceed regarding the Hawar islands but in the afternoon he appeared to be somewhat indignant that His Highness had so clearly refused to discuss any areas other than Hawar. Be was most anxious to know the reason for this but was not informed. 8. On Monday morning I had a conversation with Mr. Thornburg who had heard of Mr. Skliros's interview with His Highness and something of what that had passed. He explained/from his point of view it appeared that His Highness had favoured Petroleum Concessions Limited by discussing the additional area with Mr. Skliros. I informed Mr. Thornburg that His Highness had not made any decision as to a con cession and that doubtless he would be given a similar opportunity of discussing the matter. 9. I think it is desirable that this brief account of the last two days oil conversations should be on record. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

D.O.No. C /42&amp;. 10/14 Dated the 28th June 1938, It was typical of Holmes that after carefully giving the impression in Basrah on the 18th June that he might be going to Bahrain in a few days' time, though he did not want to, he actually arrived here by air early the following morningI 1 2 » H e came to c all on me on the 20th and I repeated to him v i v the information which you had given him on the general situation and tie Bapco 'threat'. He hinted that he would be in Bahrain for three days and has actually stayed for ten, 3. As you know, I was somewhat pre-occupied with Dubai last week and was away from Wednesday till Friday, so my information of what has happened is not as complete as It might be. I gather Holmes met everyone and paid a call on His Highness on Thursday I at Hamaithah, (Since then His Highness has been rather unwell and running a bit of a temperature so a further interview has not ' been possible), I gather too that Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman have been fairly guarded, thou^i I have not yet heard their accounts. At all events he sent Packer to me on Sunday morning with a request for a copy of Bapco's 'threatening letter'. Na turally I refused to give him copies of any correspondence, point- ing out that I had no authority to do so and that both you and I had already gone to the limit « and even perhaps a little beyond it - in telling him exactly how things stood, I asked Packer why Holrnes did not come himself to make a request of this nature and was told that Holmes was nervous of met I think we can spy here the probable trend of the report he will put in, and it may be/- The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel X Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I,B,, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Karachi,x be as well to stress the fact that no obstacles whatsoever have been put in his way here, other than the refusal of this extraordinary request for copies of correspondence. 4.
