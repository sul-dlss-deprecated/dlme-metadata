Mr. Pickthorn asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he has considered approaching the Saudi Arabian Government regarding the withdrawal of the Italian Legation at Jedda? Mr. Law: Yes, Sir. His Majesty’s Gov ernment requested the Saudi Arabian Gov ernment some time ago to ask the Italian Government to withdraw their legation from Jedda. In view of the cordial rela tions which exist between Saudi Arabia and this country, the Saudi Arabian Government agreed to this request. The Italian Minister and his staff, accom panied by five civilian residents of Jedda, left on 8th February on their way back to Italy.I £ a*a -A&amp; no } f GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, ^ D„„™iS' EXPRESS LETTER 1940 .

These measures may be placed in three categories;- / Si. x P.Z.675/39 flagged. P.Z.2488/39 flagged (l) Special measures required to influence the Arab Rulers in the Gulf. On the 17th March the Foreign Office addressed despatches (P.Z.1698/39) to H.M.’s Representatives at * Angora, Bagdad, Jedda and Tehran on the subject of the measures to be taken to influence the countries to which they v/ere accredited in favour of Great Britain in the event of war. The drafts of these despatches came before the Secretary of State on the 30th January x and were approved by the G.I.D. on the 16th February. Copies of the despatches issued on 17thMarch were sent to the Government of India and the Persian Gulf. On the 19th April the Foreign Secretary telegraphed that the Viceroy, on reading the correspondence, thought that an examination should be made, in consultation with the Political Resident, of the necessity for taking special measures in like circumstances to influence the petty Arab Rulers of the Gulf. The Government of India had not been aware that this aspect of the matter had not been overlooked here, and the position was explained to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe in our telegram of the 28th April (P.Z.2500/39, which please see). On the same day the Political Resident, who had hastened to consider the matter in the light of Sir A. Metcalfe’s telegram of the 19th April, sent ^610) Wt 25956/235 10 000 9/38 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 (8650) Wt.40880/22 10,000 1/39T' L- ^ off an express letter (P.Z.2892/39) containing his views and recommendations. The Government of India 1 s views thereon are avEiited, and the correspondence has heen circulated to the G.I.D. Middle East (Official) Sub. Committee. The principal points in the Political Resident’s letter are as follows:- Saudi Arabia: The Political Resident suggests Captain de Gaury as the Political Officer who might he sent to Riyadh if war breaks out while de Gaury is on leave# Also, he digresses to the''question of the importance in certain circumstances of placating the Rashid family of Hail. The importance of the l Hasa oil field is stressed and the possibility A-J /&gt;N -a. * suggested of securing a pre-emption agreement with the ^ ^ ^ * c ^ / c^y / Company. ^ i /W- oj! it, yil , Iraq. He now tempers his early enthusiasm for an Iraqi ^ £ t port in Koweit in view of recent hostility shown to ^ ^ L Koweit by the Iraqis. Arab Sheikhs. He refers to the question of giving assistance in the matter of arms, particularly to Muscat and also to Qatar; this is a matter tied up with the Defence Scheme v/hich is being handled by the R.A.P. and Air Ministry. As regards Muscat, he points out that the Sultan is an independent ruler and will not be automatically at war on our side. He therefore discusses the question (arising in connexion with the defence scheme) of giving Muscat a guarantee of defence, and here he suggests, as an alternative means of ensuring the Sultan's good will, the grant of a monthly subsidy 'for the The/- Minute Paper. Department. ^ lisTT^i umj*. u*. U * * Tv. /- ^ 4 fK)U&gt; f^r ^ tt^ a 7 ^v'*-kh) , y~J The posting of a Politisl Officer to the r _rucial Coast is recommended, and for the immediate future Captain Howes is suggested. Finally, propaganda. The Political Resident seems satisfied with present arrangements for time of peace hut suggests that these should he supplemented in time of v/ar and asks authority now to recruit extra staff for the purpose as required when the emergency occurs. Defence question^- the giving of assistance to local Rulers hy way of grants of arms, etc. and the question whether a guarantee of defence could he given to Muscat - will have to he considered, in connexion with the Gulf Defence Schemes, hy the appropriate Suh-Committee of the C.I.D. The other suggestions- i.e. presents to local Rulers, better representation on the Trucial Coast, circulation of news sheets to extend ardsupplement the broadcasting of nev/s hy the British Broadcasting Corporation, etc. can probably he disposed of departmentally in consultation with the Government of India, as they a re on a scale suited to the modest needs of the situation. The question of the need to give the Sultan of Muscat a subsidy alternative or additional to a guarantee of protection can only he decided when the time comes - and should present no difficulty then. (2) Local Defence schemes for Bahrein, Koweit, the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms and Muscat* These schemes have been prepared hy the A.O.C. Iraq in consultation with the Political Resident and have now been received in the Air Ministry. They have sent us copies of the various scheres and we have asked the Government of India for their comments(see papers at P.Z.3257 at top of separate file). It is understood that the schemes will he considered hy the Overseas Defence Committee of the C.I*. D. in July. We know that the .Political Resident considers that these schemes are very satisfactory. The general idea of the schemes is to train and equip local forces adequate to deal with attempts at sabotage and tribal raiding parties, at any rate until reinforcements can arrive. These reinforcements would be provided either from N&amp;val sloops or from the British forces in Iraq, but it is recommended that if such reinforcements are not available, a battalion of infantry should be sent from India to the help of * M. 3 6 tM&amp;L+L, ^ 4 Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat, and a platoon to Sharjah We must wait to hear what the. Government of India have • to say about this, but they may not be very willing to commit themselves to this extent (3) Bmergenc y legislation to equip the Political authorities with the necessary powers . In consultation with the Foreign Office we have drafted an Order-in-Council for the application of emergency legislation in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf in which we exercise jurisdiction. The Order-in-Council would be issued under the U.K. Jar Emergency Powers (Defence) Act and the Trading v/ith the Enemy Act, and would empov/er the Political Resident to make Defence Regulations and Trading with the Enemy Regulations. Draft Defence Regulations have been prepared, while the Trading v/ith the Enemy Regulations are now under consideration. Except for one or two minor points of detail v/hich are being further considered, the draft Order-in-Council aid the Draft Defence Regulations have now been agreed to by the Government of India and the/Minute Paper Department Sv ^r^ / ~ a ^\ ^ W«./7 c A 6 W fc .25950/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

The Defence Regulations v/ould give the Political authorities such powers as the following: to exclude unauthorised persons from 'protected” places: to deal v/ith sabotage and espionage: to deport undesirables: to institute censorship. As the Regulations can of course apply only to persons over whom v/e possess jurisdiction in the territories concerned, it will be necessary simultaneously to invite the various Ru^rs in the Gulf to issue proclamations applying to persons under their jurisdiction such of the Regulations as are relevant. In order to avoid possibly dangerous delay on the occurrence of an emergency, the Political Resident has recently been instructed to broach the subject to the Rulers forthwith, informing them that in case of war he would be issuing Defence Regulations and inviting them to consider the preparation of suitable proclamations on similar lines for application to persons under their own jurisdiction. It is not anticipated that any of them will make any trouble about / this, but they will no doubt need a little time for consideration and discussion and it is desirable that : / they should take this time before and not after the outbreak of war. -L ^ tc, ‘T^j!

In regard to its position in war please see my letter no.c/122 of tne 1st ^arcn 1939 (sent to you and tne G-overnmeut of India under Printed Letter no. c/123 of same date). From paragrapn 3 of this letter it will be seen that tne Sultan before engaging nimself on our side would require from nis Majesty’s Government a definite guarantee of defence. Althougn, as explained in my letter quoted above, we could use tne Sultan’s territory even tnougn ne remained neutral it would nevertneiess be an advantage if ne were formally on our side, for example, in / dealing &gt;)v / 14 dealing witn enemy Agents (and in tnis connection it must be remembered tnat all foreigners except Britisn subjects and Britisn protected persons are under tne jurisdiction of the sultan), and in seizing enemy merchant shipping, if any sucn too* refuge in muscat waters, especially in tne naroours of muscat and Matt rah. 1'here may be objections against giving tne Sultan tne guarantee ne ashs for.

Rear Gibson, We have been considering your letter No.P.Z.6964/37 of October 25th to Beckett about the question of War Emergency Legislation in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, and I now enclose a copy of a minute by Beckett on the subject. We agree that it will be as well to take advantage of Eowle’s presence in London to go into the question of precisely what powers and arrangements are necessary, having regard to local circumstances in the Persian Gulf and the exact interests which need protection. We think that the Service Departments should be in on the discussion as well. You may therefore like to consider arranging an interdepartmental meeting at the India Office to consider these preliminary aspects of the problem some time before Eowle has to return to the Gulf. Someone from here (probably myself) will gladly attend. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) T.V.Brenan. J. E. Gibs on, Esq., India Office.MI2TUTB BY MR.BECKETT. The question of what regulations must he put in force in the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms to safeguard British interests there in war time is a question to he decided primarily and in the first place hy Political and Service Departments and is not a question for a Legal Adviser. It depends upon what are the special British interests there which would require protection, the dangers against which they should he protected and what is the hest way of dealing with them. Therefore it seems to me that the next action to he taken is for the India Office, while Sir T.C.Fowle is still in England, to call* a meeting to consider the question at which representatives of the Service Departments and the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office and perhaps Mr.Orchard should he invited to he represented or to attend. 2. There are, however, a certain number of points raised in Sir T.C.Fowle's memorandum on which perhaps I can say something useful now. 3. In paragraph 5 of his memorandum, Sir T.C.Fowle raises , rightly I think, wha.t must he a preliminary question for the consideration of the whole of this matter, namely, are we to consider these Persian Gulf sheikhdoms as neutral territories in a war in which His Majesty is engaged or being involved in the war as part of the British Empire ? In dealing with this question Muscat must he separated from the others and dealt with later. As these principalities are British protected States enjoying no foreign relations with any other country and stand upon much the same footing as the Malay States or Zanzibar, the natural conclusion would he that in case of war they will he involved in the same manner as other/( other British protected States. It would appear from 2 . Sir T. C. Fowls’s memorandum that in fact in the last war we did not in any way treat the territories of these rulers as neutral territories and that our actions there would have entitled any of our enemies in the late war to consider them as belligerent territory, though in fact the question whether they were to be considered neutral or belligerent was never raised or decided in any direct and concrete form. Possibly the records of the Foreign Office or the India Office may throw further light on this point. In any case, as Sir T.C.Fowls correctly observes, in present conditions when the territories of these rulers are from the British point of view the Suez Canal of the air as well as being the sources of most Important oil supplies , it would seem obvious that our action and conduct there must be such as to make it inevitable that any contention that the territories are neutral territories would be patently false, and that it would be Impossible to keep up any fiction that they were in any respect neutral territory. I think therefore we should have to proceed on the assumption that they must be regarded as belligerent territories participating in the war in the same way as British i territories in general. 4. The position of Muscat is different because it is technically an independent State enjoying relations with other countries besides His Majesty's Government, but in fact our influence with the ruler of Muscat is so preponderant that I presume that if we found it necessary to do so, we should put pressure on him to declare war and come into it as an ally of the British Thipire. I do not know, however, that the practical considerations involved would lead5./ lead us to take this course, with France to be taken into connexi on. 3. There is the 1862 declaration consideration in this 5. With reference to paragraphs 8 to 10, where :&gt;ir T.C.Fowle deals with Koweit, Bahrein and Q,atr, I think ohat in supposing that the new regulations which have to be made will be ning’s Regulations under the existing Koweit, Bciirein and Qatr Orders-in-Council as the case may be, he ovexlooxcs trie fact that it is contemplated that new Orders- in-Council would be made under the future Act (which is still a Birlj and that these Orders-in-Council would themselves emoody the bulk or all of the new regulations required to be put into force in the emergency. It is a matter for consideration whether we should have three new Orders-in- ^ ouncil, one for each of these territories, or one applying to each of the three territories. In spite of the fact that there is a difference between the classes of persons who are subject to our jurisdiction in Bahrein on the one hand and Q,atr and Koweit on the other, I think that probably one Grder- in-Council could be made. If we proceeded in this way, it would be desirable I think in order to provide for developnents to include in the Crder-in-Council the article giving the Political Resident power to make further regulations of the same kind by King’s Regulation and to amend or repeal provisions of the regulations in the Order- in-Council by King’s Regulation. The alternative procedure would be that the Orders-in-Council made under the present will (future Act) would be short Orders-in-Council giving the Political Resident power to deal by regulation with all the matters which are covered by the Bill. He would then, acting under this Order, immediately make three new sets of King’s Regulations.4. 6. In any case the action taken would not be action under the King’s Regulation articles of the existing Orders- Therefore it is not necessary to consider in such detail as Sir T.C.Kowle does the extent to which his powers under the existing Orders a,re sufficient. The new Orders-in-Couneil must of course provide that they and the regulations made thereunder override, to the extent of any inconsistency, the provisions of the existing Orders-in-Council and regulations made thereunder. It will of course be necessary in drafting the new Orders-in-Council and regulations to bear in mind the general legal system of the territories for which they are designed, viz. that laid down by the existing Orders-in-Counci.l and the fact that we are legislating for territories where the ordinary law applied to British subjects through our tribunals is Indian law and not English law. 7. I agree with Sir T.C.Eowle that it will oe no doubt desirable that some or all of these emergency regulations are also made applicable to the persons in these territories who are not under our jurisdiction and that for this purpose the Political Resident will have to get the three rulers to legislate, making some or all of these regulations also enforcible through their own tribunals upon their ov/n subjects and other persons subject to their jurisdiction. 8. It is then necessary to consider the case of Muscat and a preliminary question here is that already discussed above as to whether Muscat is going to be considered as being neutral or not. If Muscat is going to be considered to be neutral, then the regulations which we shall have to make for British subjects in Muscat will probably/5. probably be more limited than those made in the case of the other Persian Gulf territories, and I do not think we can expect the ruler to make them binding upon other people in Muscat. Our own regulations will have to be limited by the consideration that they are regulations to be enforced by us on neutral territory. If, on the other hand, Muscat is going to come into the war with us, then the matter can proceed upon much the same footing as in the other three territories and we can legitimately ask the ruler to enforce our regulations upon all the persons subject to his jurisdiction. A point, however, which has to be considered in this connexion is this. Is it not the case that the French and United States also possess consular jurisdiction over their nationals in Muscat, and if so do they exercise it ? 9. There ramain the other sheikhdoms of the Trucial coast. Here, as Sir T.C.Fowle explains, we have no Orders-in-Council in force at the moment because we have never had any grant of jurisdiction from the rulers. Before the emergency arises, it is possible that we shall have received grants and made Orders-in-Council. To the extent that this is so, these territories will fall into the same class as Bahrein, Koweit and Q,atr. We have to consider, however, the position on the assumption that these things have not happened. Sir T.C.Fowle suggests that we should, so to speak, arrogate jurisdiction to ourselves without any grant and when the emergency occurs enact the regulations for these territories by an ad hoc Order-in-Council. Though I appreciate the reasons why he suggests this, I do not think it will do. In the first place, the Order-in-Council which/© 6 . which he envisages would have to be made either under the Bill (future Act) or under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. It could not, however, be made under the Bill as at present drafted because that limits the power to legislate by Order-in-Council to the extent of the jurisdiction which we possess in the territory concerned and ex hypothesi Sir T.C.Fowle’s proposal would mean legislating in a case where we had not got any existing jurisdiction. It could not be based under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act because we could not justify it on grounds of 'grant, usage, sufferance, etc.' The only way therefore we could do anything of this kind would be if we first annexed the territories of the rulers concerned or turned them at any rate into British colonial protectorates and this is a step which I think would have to be ruled out on political grounds. Therefore I think the only thing we can do in the case of these territories is that directly the emergency arises we should exercise our pressure and get immediate grants of jurisdiction from the rulers. Having done so, we should then immediately issue two Orders-in- Council for these territories, one a general Order on the lines of the Q,atr Order and the other an emergency Order-in- Council of the kind under consideration for the other Gulf territories. It may be said that this is rather a lot to undertake in a hurry in time of emergency, but I see no alternative. 10. I fear it would be impossible to adopt the proposal in paragraph 13 of Sir T.C.Fowle r s memorandum. Unless we first obtained new grants of jurisdiction from all the Rulers, the Order-in-Council suggested here would be/Toe ult ra vires our powers under rather the Foreign Jurisdiction Act or the new Bill. Further the Political consequences in the sheikhdoms would surely be mos undesirable. ci-^uXii Seox^e t * j) • 0* ico • 4 &lt; 2?t)0 - ji P.

X « K * X I have road the extract from the Minutes of the 347th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence recording the Committee's conclusions in regard to the recommendations submitted by the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee in their report (C.I.D. Paper 1517-E) as to the measures which might be taken to influence certain countries in the Middle East on the outbreak of any European war in which we were involved. As regards Iran the Sub-Committee express the view that Iran will probably maintain a strictly neutral attitude at any ra^e in the initial stages of a conflict, but that her attitude might well be changed to our disadvantage if the progress of the war seemed t o offer a safe opportunity for Iran to take by forcre whatever she wanted in the Persian Gulf. To influence Iran it is proposed to send a Press Attach^ to Tehran and to issue news broadcasts in the Iranian languageo It does not appear from the Report of the Sub committee that the Committee appreciated that from the point of view of our war time supplies of oil, it is of paiamount importance that we should have the goodwill of Iran in the event of a major emergency. Under allocations made by the Oil Board, Iran has been scheduled as a source of supply of about 10,000,000 tons in the first year of war, v/hile her potential output is about 14,000,000 tons per annum. The latter figure represents about one-half the requirements of the Empire on a war basis. There is no alternative to Iran for certain supplies and if theywere denied to us, the situation would he very serious. If Iran were to become hostile, her first step would probably be to attempt to deny to this country the use of the oilfields and refineries. I imagine that the need for taking steps in the last resort to prevent this have been planned. But it is of the highest importance to make overy effort to avoid such an issue arising by doing every thing that is practicable to keep Iran friendly. Perhaps the Middle East Sub-Committee have considered this point, but unless you see ary objection, I would suggest that the importance attached by the Oil Board to Iran should be brought to the notice of the Sub-Committee with a view to their considering whether some further measures might not be taken. k x x x x *-3- &lt;£) 2. MEASURES TO IflPIUEIICE AHAB 3TA:J:2S AsW MINOR POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST ON THE OUTBREAK OF A EUROPEAN WAR INVOLVING THE U1TITED KINGDOM * THE SUB-COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Secretary for Mines to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Paper No. H.E. (0) 300), arising from a Report by the Sub-Committee (Paper No. M.E. (0) 294), approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence (Paper No. M.E. (0) 297). THE CHAIRMAN explained that the letter from the Secretary for Mines (paper No. M.E. (0) 300) arose from paragraph 10 of the Sub-Committee’s Report (Paper No. M.E. (0) 297), recommending measures for Iran. The Petroleum Department were naturally anxious about the safety of the Anglo-Iranian Oil wells and the refinery at Abadan, and it might seem advisable to the Sub committee to strengthen their recommendations for action to be taken in Iran on the outbreak of war. MR. STARLING- explained that the output from the Iranian oil wells was vital to the Empire in war ^including supplies for the Navy. The Secretary for Mines was seriously dimturb:;! by the first two sentences of paragraph 10 of the report which ran:- ’’We think it might be taken for granted that, in the eventuality of a war in Europe, Iran would at first make every effort to remain neutral. It is probable that this attitude would be maintained, at any rate in the initial stages of the conflict, but might well be changed to our disadvantage, if the progress of the war seemea to offer a safe opportunity for Iran to ^ake by force whatever she wanted in the Persian Gulf.”MAJOR MALLABY explained to the Sub-Committee that a scheme existed for the defence of the oil fields by a force from India. The despatch of this force would not be automatic, but would only tahe place if the situation appeared to require it. WING COMMANDER ELY pointed out that this scheme was not designed to deal with action by a hostile Iran. Some of the Air Forces assigned to the force would not be available in the event of a major war. He suggested however that the danger envisaged by the Mines Department was somewhat academic. He could noo see Iran giving up her neutral position while we retained control of the sea, since the only outlet for her oil was by the sea, and the Iranian revenues depended on its sale. If Iran attacked and captured the oil fields they could not market the oil, while we held the Persian Gulf. THE CHAIRMAN agreed, but suggested that there might be political measures which, if taken, would ensure a benevolent attitude on the part of the Iranian authorities. Reference was made to the experience of the Great War, during which the security of the pipe line had been maintained largely through the influence of the local Khans but MR. BAXTER pointed out that the Government in Iran had now been centralised and the local chieftains deprived of any authority. Hence action would have to be taken with the Central Government. MR. STARLING explained that Iran obtained a substantial income from the Oil Company amounting -4~in 1937 to £3-§- millions. The Iranian authorities were very anxious to keep the output as high as possible, but circumstances might arise in war - for example, as the result of a shortage of tankers - in which at certain periods we could not remove the full outjjut of the wells. This might give rise to irritation and political troubles. Iran was badly in need of money and he suggested^ for the consideration of the Sub-Committee, that some form of grant or subsidy might be considered which would compensate for loss of income, and assure a friendly attitude. MR. BAXTER said that the repor” referred to by Mr. Starling, (which had been drafted by the Foreign Office), had only been intended to deal with measures which could be taken at once on the outbreak of war, and which could be sanctioned and arranged in advance. He detailed other measures, covering the supply of railway materials and of aircraft and insurance against commercial loss, which had been considered in the case of Iran, but were being held in reserve for use later in a war. The Foreign Office view'was that at any rate in the early stages of a war Iran would remain neutral, and there would be time to consider further action. MR. HALE reminded the Committee that the provision of foreign exchange would entail serious difficulties in war. MR. STARLING said that the Petroleum Department felt that this question was of such paramount importance that it ought not to To left for decision until war broke out. MAJOR GROVER and MR. BAXTER agreed with Wing Commander Ely unless we lost control of the sea routes entirely - in which case we should lose the war - we should retain control of the Persian Gulf, and thus of the output of the oil wells. It seemed to them very improbable that Iran would do anything toconflict with her own financial interests MAJOR GROVER suggested that some scheme might be devised by which we could offer to safeguard the financial position of Iran during periods when output might drop because we were unable to remove the oil. WING COMMANDER ELY agreed, COLONEL CAWTHORN suggested that we should give an undertaking to Iran directly war broke out that she would not suffer financi-.lly if we were unable to take the output of the oil wells, MR. STARLING suggested that this point might be discussed with His Majesty's Minister in Iran* and that if a proposal were agreed upon action could best be taken through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. MR, BAXTER thought that nothing should be said to the Iranian Government until war broke out. MR. STARLING agreed, but suggested that a decision on the action to be taken should be reached now. MR. HALE said that the Treasury could not agree to offering the Iranians a blank cheque because of the exchange difficulty. CONCLUSION. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed ~ (a) that some form of guarantee should be given to the Iranian Government against financial loss arising out of any temporary failure on our part, in time of war, to take the output of the Iranian oil we11s 0(b) that the Foreign Office, the Treasury and the Petroleum Department should consider the question, and submit a Memorandum jointly to the Sub-Committee as early as possible. (c) that in any event no communication in this connection should be made to the Iranian Government before the outbreak of hostilities,,In any further communication oA this subject, please quote j No. S 1731/G SECRET.

I am, however, fully aware of the import rice of retaining the King 1 a benevolent neutrality, and I realise that in the face of lavish territorial offers from the enemy direct financial assistance may be necessary in order to obtain this end. His Majesty's Government therefore recognise in principle that they may be obliged, at an early stage after the outbreak of hostilities, to authorise the grant of a substantial subsidy to Ibn 3aud. ft. The exact time when eueh an offer should be nadc, the fora In which it could be iadc most acceptable to His h&amp;je^ty, , nd the imount of the subsidy, are matters which, I think, umst be left for later decision.

His ajesty’s Representative at Jedda should report by telegram, on or after the outbreak of a war, immediately he considers the time ripe for an offer of financial assistance to Xbn ,aud, the form in which the o fer should be made, and the minimum sura which wo ild, in his opinion, be adequate* In order to i’ive you some indication of the amount to whi^h Hie Ra^esty’s Govern -tent might be prepared to agree, I would suggest that the recormendation might be to the effect that an initial payment should be offered of not more than £200,000 to be Xbllowed at intervals, but not necessarily monthly intervals, by further instalments* 4. / /^In paragraph 4 of your despatch, Jiou propose that Hi a Majesty’s Government should compensate Ibn Gaud for losses arising from the inevitable decline in the annual Pilgriniage to Mecca; and in paragraph 10 you suggest that Great Britain should offer to take the place of Egypt in financing the construction of the tiedda-Uecca-.*rafat and Je&amp;da- edina roads. Both these proposes have been examine^ but it seems on the whole preferable to expend any sujtis devoted to the rjiaintenance of audi Arabian neutrality in a direct subsidy to the Ring rather than on the performance of specific services in the country.

In the ligfrt of the circustances existing after the outbi^esik of hostilities, the pocaibiiity of offextag to provide Ibn ;$uud with arms, amiBitlon and military equipment on the easiest terns possible, though it ie doubtful to what extent in time of war such arms and .mnitions could be made available, fear that, owing to the necessities of war, it is in the highest degree improbable that any assistance could be offered to Ibn ^aud in aviation matter© althou$i this point could also be considered further in the light of existing conditions, 6. I approve your suggestion that it would be very valuable if a British Political Officer could be sent at once on the outbreak of war to stay at Riyadh, if Ibn ^aud would permit this, in order to explain the situation to him day by day and to help to counteract the enemy propaganda which would be reaching him by wireless and perhaps by other means also. His fa^eety's Government have sanctioned in princix^le this proposal to send a British Officer to Riyadh an one which might be put to bn baud immediately on the outbreak of war* 7* There are circunetancea, especially if it were to be apparent that Jbn aud were becoming less able to manage personally the affairs of hla Kingdom, in which it mi^itbe desirable to set aside a certain sum (say £85,000} to be need, if opportunity offered, to influence one or two of the leading Saudi Arabian officials In our favour* Hio Majaaty’a Government would be prepared to cons icier favourably any pro osals to this effect which Hie Majesty’s Hapretentative at Jedda might wish to put forward after the outbreak of a war, provided that he were aattefied that important results could thereby be obtained.a* the meusiurea onggested in paragraph 5 o your deepatch, In connexion with the Haaa oil-field f CiJi be further expioired when the eaergeney arises. It see e probable that there would be no reduction in the King 1 © profits fron this source, since the demand for oil would be stimulated by a war and its price would rise accordingly. Moreover, it is unlikely that the working of the Hasa oil-field would be disturbed by military operations. His Bajwaty 1 © Government wovsid certain, y be prepared to consider in case of need how far they could help in providing transport for the American staff of the oil-field, and for the necessary taterial. I am, with great truth and regard, dir. Your obedient -ervant, (l or the Secretary of State) (signed) C.W.BAXTER.~ir t I have had under concideratioii your secret despatch ;io. T06 ( 601/5/38} of the 31st August regarding the measures which might be taken, on the outbreak of war between the United kingdom and a Suroi^ean rower, to influence the Iranian Government in favour of this country. 2, I agree that, in such an emergency, the Iranian Government would at first make every effort to remain completely neutral. It v/ould be difficult, if not impossible, to induce them to adopt an attitude more favourable to this country than that of strict neutrality. It foilova therefore that no measures involving financial expenditure on a considerable scale need be contemplated at present with a view to influence the Iranian Government in favour of the United ingdom on the outbreak of hostilities. 3# I share your view that it will be necessary, on the outbreak of hostilities, to avoid giving the Iranian Government any cause for complaint in the Persian Gulf area, and to avoid, for example, any steps which the Iranian Govern:nent might conceivably regard as directed against the legitimate interests of Iranian nationals in Bahrein. I appreciate too that steps will have to be taken to avoid giving the Iranian Government any cause for complaint that the political Resident in the Persian Gulf is carrying out on i ersian soil functions such as are incompatible with his residence in a neutral country. 4. After fully considering your i^ecamnendations, His Majesty’s Government have reached the conclusion that the measures to be taken in Iran iiTTraediutely on the outbreak of war J. eymour, dsq,.. C.M.G., C*V*o., etc., etc., etc., British Legation, Tehran.&gt; - 2 - nar can probably be limited to QMsures connected with propaganda. 'They have approved in principle your suggestion that a press attach^ should at once be setit to Tehran to concern himaelf with all matters connected with propa,: undo and with the Iranian press. They have also approved your suggestion that arrangements should now be made whereby news broadcasts in the version language on be started immediately on the outbreak oi* a war, and the British Broadcasting Corporation have already been up presetted in this ^ connexion. ’ 5. His Wijiitf^e Gowemnent appreciate that It mlf/xt at a later stage be necessary t as the best ;. j eon3 of inducing the : rani an Government to maintain a strictly imi&gt;artial attitude, to conteniplat&lt; an offer to them of economic or financial assistance. &lt;uch assistance as you suggest f take the fom o ^ railway material or aircraft, although it is evident that in war time His Majesty’s Government would have considerable difficulty in sparing material of this nature, and there are other countries, such as ~gypt, Iraq and Turkey, with prior elai a In this respect. . You have also suggested the! assistance to the Iranian Government might take the form of arrange enta to supply goods from the United Kingdom, or to finance purchases elsewhere, to take the place of Iran 1 © imports from the enemy countries. This suggestion is one Tvhich wiHUiave to be fully considered in the light of the circumstances existing at the ti «e. It would be impassible at present to decide whether His Majesty f s Government would be in a p altion to supply Iran with the type of goods which she would be lost likely to require. It is conceivable, however, that, if political consideratione made it desirable, and if the volume ofir Ho: 150. (i. 1751/0) 1 have had under consideration the report enclosed In Your e xcellency’s despatch No«589 (451/3/58) of the 18th July, regarding the Pleasures which ail^ht be taken to influence the Iraqi Government In fav&gt;'Mr o'' this country in the event ot the united Kingdom becamlng involved in a war with a Oreat ower. 2, I have noted your observations in paragraph 5 o ’ your re ort, regarding the measures which might be taken to ensure that Iraq shall implement wholeheartedly her obligations under the ijnglo~Iraqi treaty of Alliance. s you are aware, steps were taken during the international crisis last bept© iber to keep the Iraqi Government fully informed of all developments in the situation, and it i® evident that in any future emergency similar arrangements will have to be made to enable the imbaery to keep in close touch with the Iraqi Government concerning the general situation, to such all extent that the Iraqi Government will be unable to claim that they have not been fully consulted. I agree moreover with your view that the greatest care will have to be taken to eneurc that war docs not occur in circumstances which could be held by Iraq to contravene the covenant of the League or the fuet of aria. 5. ulnae the receipt of your despatch under reference, the Iraqi krime , Inieter has expressed to -r fouutoun-foaw&amp;ll his earnest hope, as recorded in Bagdad telegram No*143 of ,eptember 29th, that should the financial position of Iraq suffer from a war, through for example the closing of the Mediterranean to Merchant vessels, (i^hich would mean that no oil could be exported from Kirkuk, with a consequent loos of royalties}, or if the economic position of the population should become ouch that B.D.

The Iraqi Government may be assured, in reply to any similar rcvjueat during an international criais, that His ajesty’s Government will give their most sympathetic consideration to any request for inancial assietance vhich the Iraqi Government may feel obliged to make in the event of such difficulties arising. 4. In paragraph 6 O- your memorandum under reply, you have put forward eight other suggestions which might be of use in case some further measure might be found n oeasary in order to induce the Iraqi Government to adopt an attitude favourable to this country. Of these measures, points ( c d) and (8), being merely assurances which would not involve Kie Majesty 1 8 Government in any more extensive obligations than those at present existing # can be approved without further qualification. Yoi arc accordingly authoriued, at your discretion, and if you think that such action would in fact assist In influencing the Iraqi Government^ attitude in favour of this country, to give them the following assurances: (a) A renewal of the undertaking regarding the incidence of expenditure under article 4 of the Trdaty given In the High Commiaaioner’s letter to the raqi i rime inieter, Ho.187 of November 23rd, 19 31. (b} Aa assurance that the use by His ajesty’s Government of the facilities to Tfcich they arc entitled under rticle 4 of the Treaty would in no vvay prejudice Iraq 1 © complete independence as a sovereign State. £. As regards your further suggestion (Bo.5) of an offer of a new loan on very easy terms, say 41,000,0 0 at 2/ , to enable Iraq to meet war expenditure, His Majesty’s Government would, if necessary • e • » •3 necessary, be prepared to accord their most sympathetic consideration to such a scheme. It is not, however, clear that Iraq, if the United 'Ingdom were involved in war, would be obliged herself to incur 'war expenditure'* Your suggestion lio.7, that an offer night be made to furnish . raq free of charge with the necessary artillery and small arms, aramunition and other military equipment to enable her forces to carry out the work which would devolve upon them under Article 4 of the Treaty of Alliance, would also be favourably considered if the emergency were to arise. It is not, however, clear that the Iraqi forces would be required to carry out military operations, at all events at the outset of a European war, and it must further be borne in mind that, if the United 1 ingdom were at war, it might be difficult, or even impossible, to spare arms and ammunition vdiich would certainly be urgently required elsewhere. 6 . The following further suggestions which you have advanced do not, I feel, require an iraaediate decision at the present stage, since they would not have to be acted upon immediately on the outbreak of war. In some cases, it might be best to wait until definite requests are received from the Iraqi Government; but in each case 1 think it best to leave it to Your Excellency to raise the question after the outbreak of war, if circumstances should appear to you to render It desirable to adopt some such course. These suggestions, which His Majesty's Government would be prepared to consider Airther in the event of war, if resubmitted together with an urgent recommendation from Your .xcellency, are as follows:~ (1) Ail undertaking that in the event of victory Hie Majesty's Government would assist Iraq politically and financially to c; rry out the project of establishing an Iraqi pott either at • • • •at Xhor .bitulXiih or on tho Bay o ‘ Kow^lt. (2) The cancellation of the outstanding inatalrienta due to Hla Gorerment for the ^ ort of liaara (coat about 270,000). (3) jj offer to bear the Y/hole or part of the cost of the sinking tmd of the Iraqi btate Loui) of 1937 (1:96,000 a year for about 15 years}* (4) An offer to arrange at the end of the war with a British firm for the building on very favourable terms of one of Iraq*a essential major irrigation works. f. I appreciate that, once the Ira ^i Govemsient have been won over to wholehearted coo^jeration, it will be desirable or neeeeaary to take further meaeurea, for which the Iraqi Ooverrrnent Till probably* require cOime financial assistance from His Majesty’s Ooveraaent. For instance, as you eeggest, it would be leairablL to endeavour to persuade the Iraqi Government toi (a) Increase tile strength of the ilitary Mission (Coct: Five Officerss about .210,CXX) &amp; year). (b) Fo increase the British adviaory staff in the biniotry of the interior and to appoint British fdfiinistrativo Inspectors to the ehlef provincial centres. (Co ts ivc officials: i!10,CX)0 a year}. (c) To stop trading with the hostile Fewer. 8 . I think, however, that further consideration mi^t usefully be given to the measureo which would bo re uired on the outbreak of wisr to assist the Iraqi Government to control their press, tc arrange for the publication of suitable Rsaterial, and to counter or auppresc enemy propu an da.

MEASURES TO INFLUENCE ARAB STATES AND MINOR POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST ON THE OUTBREAK OF A EUROPEAN WAR INVOLVING THE UNITED KINGDOM. (Previous Paper No. M.E. (O.) 270.) REPORT. THE Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East have already submitted (C.l.D. Paper No. 1447-B)* a preliminary Report in conformity with the following conclusion of the 315th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence :— “ (iii) That the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee should investigate and report on the measures which might be taken, either before or on the outbreak of war, to influence those Minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war.” 2. In that preliminary report it was pointed out that measures to influence Minor Powers and Arab States, as envisaged in the foregoing conclusion of the Committee of Imperial Defence, could be considered as falling under two heads:— (a) Measures required in the event of war or imminent war ; (b) Measures which might be taken before the outbreak of war. 3. The measures which might be taken before the outbreak of war were fully dealt with in the preliminary report, which was dated the 13th July, 1938 (C.l.D. Paper No. 1447-B), and has already been considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence! and by the Cabinet.:} The Sub-Committee do not wish at present to put forward any further recommendations under this head. 4. The present report will therefore deal only with the measures required in the event of war or imminent war; and it has been drawn up in the light of the views and recommendations of His Majesty’s Representatives in the countries under consideration. * Also Paper No. M.E. (O.) 270. f C.l.D. 329th Meeting, Conclusion 7. j: Cabinet 35 (38), Conclusion 10, and 36 (38), Conclusion 2. [18612] B2 5. We have interpreted the term “Minor Powers and Arab States as referring to those Middle Eastern countries with which the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee are ordinarily concerned, and the present report will therefore deal with the following countries : — (1) Turkey. (2) Iran. (3) Iraq. (4) Transjordan. (5) Saudi Arabia. (6) The Yemen. (7) The Arab States of the Persian Gulf. We have decided not to include Egypt and the Sudan, partly because these are countries with which the Sub-Committee are not ordinarily concerned, partly because the problems arising in these countries are very different from those arising in the Asiatic territories which we have considered, and partly because the considered views of the local British authorities have required some modification in the light of experience gained during the international crisis last September, and are not yet available in their final form. We understand, however, that His Majesty's Ambassador in Cairo has already forwarded several reports, and that his further views and recommendations have been forwarded by the Foreign Office and are now under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff. Effect in Arab Countries of British Policy in Palestine. 6. We feel it necessary at the outset to point out, as an essential part of our report, the strong feeling which exists in all Arab States in connection with British policy in Palestine. It is evident that by far the most important measure which could be taken to influence Arab States in favour of the United Kingdom would be the modification of our Palestine policy. We assume that, immediately on the outbreak of war, the necessary measures would at once be taken (if a settle ment by agreement with the Arabs had not already been reached) in order to bring about an appeasement of Arab opinion in regard to Palestine. If we fail thus to regain Arab goodwill at the outset of a war, no other measures which we can recommend are likely to influence Arab States in favour of this country. On the contrary, we shall have run a serious risk of incurring their active hostility. We are aware, however, that consideration has already been accorded to this problem, and that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciate the importance of the point to which we have felt compelled to draw attention. 7. We have suggested in the course of this Report that financial assistance or supplies in kind might have to be offered to certain countries in order to maintain their neutrality or secure their co-operation. It will be appreciated that once hostilities are in progress on a large scale our capacity to give such assistance might be severely limited by the lack of supplies and the'more pressing needs of our own defence. Moreover, financial assistance to these countries must inevitably react on the expectations of other countries, e.g., Greece, Roumania and Portugal, who will be waverers. Our exchange difficulties in the event of war are expected to be very serious and the Treasury consider that it is a mistake to suppose that our capacity for giving financial help to foreign countries can be counted upon. Turkey. 8. In the case of Turkey, His Majesty’s Government have already take certain very important measures to influence that country in our favour in a emergency. The measures taken have been notably successful We do not a present wish to recommend any further measures in the wav of financial to Turkey in the event of war or imminent war. It would; of course be necessar to maintain in such circumstances the closest diplomatic co-operation wih Turkey, to ensure that the two countries pursued a common policy in neighbouring countries both in Europe and in Asia. It would likewise be necessary to accori the most sympathetic consideration to any suggestions or requests that the Turk ^ Government might put to us. The question now for consideration however whether there are any measures which ought to be approved in nrinmr^ A present stage. We think that there are two points. neither of gr^UraportLSwhich might be approved now as likely to facilitate close Anglo-Turkish co operation in the event of war. In the first place, it would in our opinion be desirable on the outbreak of war that whole-time Service Attaches should at once be attached to His Majesty's Embassy in Turkey, and that His Majesty’s Ambassador should be able to tell the Turkish authorities that these Officers were at their disposal, under his guidance, to discuss any measures of co-operation which the two Governments might consider necessary or useful. Another suggestion which is, we think, worth pursuing is that His Majesty’s Ambassador might be authorised to discuss frankly with the Turkish Government, in the event of war or imminent war. the measures which might be arranged to ensure that the British and Turkish press should speak with one voice, and that his Excellency should be authorised to suggest to the Turkish Government that, if money were required to promote any form of publicity which the two Govern ments considered desirable in their mutual interests. His Majesty’s Government would be very willing to make a proportionate contribution. 9. We do not intend in the present report to discuss the question whether, m the event of the outbreak of war in Western and Central Europe, we should wish Turkey to enter the war on our side, or to remain a benevolent neutral. It is evident that, if we wished Turkey to become a co-belligerent, we might have to consider far wider and more important measures to influence her in our favour, but this is a larger issue which falls, we think, beyond the scope of the present report. Iran. 10. We think it may be taken for granted that, in the eventuality of a war in Europe, Iran would at first make every effort to remain completely neutral. It is probable that this attitude would be maintained, at any rate in the initial stages of the conflict, but might well be changed to our disadvantage if the progress of the war seemed to offer a safe opportunity for Iran to take bv force whatever she wanted in the Persian Gulf. We see no reason, therefore, to recommend any measures of importance to influence Iran’s attitude at the out break of hostilities, though it might later be necessary to contemplate an offer of economic or financial assistance, as the best means of keeping the Iranian Government impartial. Such assistance might take the form of railway material or aircraft, or else might consist of arrangements to supply goods’ from the I nited Kingdom, or to finance purchases elsewhere, to take the place of imports from the enemy countries. The only measures which we think might usefully be taken immediately on the outbreak of war would be certain measures connected with propaganda, such as the despatch of a press attache to Tehran and the putting into force of arrangements, which would have to be previouslv organised for the broadcasting of news in the Iranian language. Iraq. 11. It will be remembered that at the time of the recent European crisis the Iraqi Government, as the allies of His Majesty’s Government, spontaneously declared to us their firm intention of carrying out in full their obligations tc us under the Treaty of Alliance. Provided that we are able soon to satisfy Iraqi opinion with regard to our Palestine policy, and provided that Iraq remain' convinced of our ability and intention to protect her under the Alliance it may be hoped that the Iraqi attitude in any future emergency will be equally satis factory It is probable, however, that the Iraqi Government will expect to receive from us m return a considerable degree of financial assistance. Last September, for example, the Iraqi Prime Minister expressed to the British representative in Bagdad his earnest hope that, should the financial position ot Iraq suffer from a war, through, for example, the closing of the Mediter ranean to merchant vessels (which would mean that no oil could be exported from Kirkuk, with a consequent loss of royalties), or if the economic position of the population should be such that Government assistance should be necessarv the Iraqi Government could look to us for aid. It proved not to be necessary before the termination of the emergency period, for His Majesty’s Government to reply to this request. We recommend, however, that, if any similar request should be received from the Iraqi Government in some future emergency they should be assured that His Majesty s Government would &lt;dve their most [18612] B 2 'sympathetic consideration to any request for financial assistance which the Iraqi Government might feel obliged to make in the event of such difficulties arising. 12. We recommend, moreover, that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad should be authorised to renew an assurance already given to the Iraqi Govern ment in 1931 regarding the incidence of expenditure in respect of the facilities which, under Article 4 of the Treaty of Alliance, the Iraqi Government would have to place at our disposal in the event of war or the imminent threat of war. The assurance was to the effect that His Majesty’s Government would indemnify the Iraqi Government against any additional expenditure incurred by them, but would not expect to be asked to pay, for the movement or accommoda tion of troops, rates higher than those charged for Iraqi troops, or pay for the use of existing facilities when no additional expense would be involved To the Iraqi Government. The renewal of this assurance of 1931 would not, of course, involve His Majesty's Government in greater expenditure than that to which we are already committed. 13. If there were any likelihood of Iraq being involved, through her alliance with us, in military operations, we think that it would be necessary to contem plate the offer to Iraq of financial assistance in order to enable her to meet war expenditure. An offer ought also to be made, if possible, to furnish Iraq free of charge with the necessary artillery and small arms ammunition, and other military equipment, to enable her forces to carry out the work which would devolve upon them under the Treaty of Alliance. 14. We have no doubt that further measures involving considerable financial expenditure in Iraq will have to be considered by His Majesty’s Government as the war proceeds, but we think that it will be best in most cases to wait until definite requests are received from the Iraqi Government before considering the question what further measures will be required. 15. We think, however, that consideration should be given to the measures which will be required to assist the Iraqi Government to control their press, to arrange for the publication of suitable material, and to counter or suppress enemy propaganda, Transjordan. 16. In Transjordan, as a British mandated territory, conditions are different from those obtaining in the other countries dealt with in the present report. It will be possible, for example, on the outbreak of hostilities to take drastic measures against undesirable agitators. We believe, however, that it will probably be necessary to afford financial assistance to the Amir of Trans jordan, and perhaps also to subsidise certain tribal Sheikhs. We recommend therefore that the High Commissioner for Transjordan should now be instructed that, when it becomes clear that hostilities are imminent, he should seek authority from His Majesty’s Government to place at the disposal of the British Resident at Amman the sum of £10,000, with which to afford financial assistance to the Amir, and to subsidise tribal Sheikhs as considered necessary. The one news paper published in Transjordan could also be subsidised out of the £10,000 mentioned above. Additional funds for the purpose of these subsidies would have to be provided later. Saudi A rabia. 17. In Saudi Arabia, so long as present circumstances remain more or less unchanged, the problem is how to maintain Ibn Saud’s goodwill. For this purpose a settlement of the Palestine problem is essential. The assistance already promised towards the reconstruction of the Hejaz Railway will be very helpful, and any further steps to convince Ibn Saud that it is to his advantage to keep on good terms with us should be taken as and when opportunity arises. We must, however, remember that our enemies are in a position to promise him all he wants in the way of territorial expansion, without cost to themselves. Ibn Saud claims specifically Aqaba and Ma’an, now in Transjordan, and the Jebel Naqsh and the Khor-el-Odeid in the Persian Gulf, which His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Government of India have maintained to be the property of the5 lich the Iraqi ilties arising. 3 r at Bagdad raqi Govern- the facilities ■nment would ent threat of nment would e incurred by r accommoda- r pay for the ivolved ; to the lot, of course, hat to which Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. The enemies of Great Britain would no doubt promise him the satisfaction of all his claims against Transjordan, and the Arab States on the Persian Gulf, and might indeed promise to assist him in vaster territorial designs at the expense of Palestine, Transjordan. Iraq and the Persian Gulf States. It is improbable that Ibn Saud would in fact accept these suggestions from our enemies, however attractive they might appear to him, unless he was fairly certain that they were going to win the war, and at the beginning of a war his policy would probably be to try to get the best terms for his neutrality. 18. It is therefore to be expected that, at the beginning of the war, Ibn Saud would ask us for the satisfaction of his territorial claims with regard to the Jebel Naqsh and the Khor-el-Odeid, and possibly also with regard to Aqaba and Ma’an. If His Majesty’s Government were unable to make any concession on these points, their refusal would drive up the price of Ibn Saud’s neutrality in other coin. h her alliance ry to con tern- [• to meet war ish Iraq free &gt;n, and other which would •able financial overnment as to wait until nsidering the the measures heir press, to ippress enemy mditions are n the present dities to take fever, that it nir of Trans- e recommend he instructed ;eek authority tish Resident [stance to the 'he one news- the £10,000 bsidies would i more or less ill.

It seems, therefore, that it would be necessary to pay a subsidy, in one form or another, to Ibn Saud in return for his neutrality. We do not think it possible to give in advance even an approximate estimate of the amount which would be required, although the subsidies to the Sharif Hussein during the war, admittedly in return for his active military support, w r ere very large indeed, and no doubt Ibn Saud’s calculations of what he may expect from us will be worked out on some such basis. Nor is it possible to suggest in advance the form in which the offer of a subsidy could be made most attractive to the King. We recommend, therefore, that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda should be informed that, on or after the outbreak of a war, he should report by telegram, immediately he considers the time ripe for an offer of financial assistance, the form in which the offer should be made, and the minimum sum which would, in his opinion, be adequate. It might be indicated to His Majesty’s Minister, merely for his personal information and guidance, that His Majesty’s Government might be prepared to agree to an initial payment of not more than £200,000, to be followed at intervals by further instalments. 20. Other measures, which might be used to supplement the financial measures suggested in the preceding paragraph, might be an offer to help Ibn Saud by providing arms, ammunition and equipment for his regular army, or by an offer of assistance in aviation matters. A special effort ought, in any case, to be made to keep the pilgrimage running as far as possible, for example, by seeing that lack of shipping shall not prevent any intending pilgrims to Mecca from proceeding on their journey. 21. We think it would be very valuable, moreover, if a British Political Officer could be sent to stay at Riyadh, if Ibn Saud would permit this, in order to explain the situation to him day by day, and to help to counteract the enemy propaganda which would be reaching him by wireless and perhaps by other means also. We think that a proposal to send an officer to Riyadh might be put to Ibn Saud immediately on the outbreak of war. 22. There are circumstances, especially if it were to be apparent that Ibn Saud were becoming less able to manage personally the affairs of his Kingdom, in which it might be desirable to set aside a certain sum (say £25,000) to be used, if opportunity offered, to influence one or two of the leading 8audi Arabian officials in our favour. We suggest that His Majesty’s Minister might be encouraged to put forward definite recommendations to this effect after the outbreak of a war, provided that he were satisfied that important results could thereby be obtained. The Yemen. 23. The Governor of Aden has put forward certain suggestions for influencing the Yemen in our favour. One of these suggestions (the giving of presents to the Imam and senior Yemeni officials on such occasions as Moslem festivals) can with advantage be adopted at once, and the necessary approval has been given. The other measures proposed by the Governor do not call for any r &gt;1immediate action, hut will require consideration when an emergency arises. T e position is set out in the despatch to the Governor which is attached as Appendix F. The Arab States of the Persian Gulf. 24. During the recent European crisis the Political Resident at Bushiie telegraphed that it was essential for him to have a fund at his disposal for special intelligence in the Arab States of the Gulf. This fund was required not only for obtaining information, but for special payments to the Sheikhs and others to keep them on our side in case of necessity. We think that a sum of £4,000 might be devoted to this purpose immediately after the outbreak of a war, and that the allocation of this expenditure, as between the Tnited Kingdom and India, should be determined in accordance with the general principles which may govern the allocation of war expenditure between the United Kingdom and India. Propaganda. 25. In the preceding paragraphs one or two measures connected with propaganda are recommended. These are for the most part based on suggestions received from His Majesty’s Representatives in the territories concerned. But it is presumed that those responsible for the planning of a Ministry of Informa tion will prepare a comprehensive scheme for propaganda in war time in the area with which this Report is concerned, in consultation with the Foreign Office, India Office, Colonial Office and Service Departments. It is suggested that this should be undertaken immediately. Draft Despatches. 26. Draft Despatches to His Majesty’s Representatives in the countries concerned, based upon our recommendations, are contained in Appendices A-E. Summary of Recommendations. 27. Our recommendations, as described above, may be summarised as follows (the action recommended is intended, unless otherwise stated, to be taken immediately war has broken out) : — Turkey — (a) The despatch of whole-time Service Attaches to Angora. (b) Discussion with Turkish Government of joint measures, including financial measures, in regard to the Turkish press. Iran — (c) Despatch of Press Attache to Tehran. (d) News broadcasts in the Iranian language. Iraq — (e) Offer to Iraqi Government (but only in reply to their requests) to consider sympathetically request for financial assistance in the event of loss of oil royalties or economic difficulties. (/) Renewal of assurance to Iraqi Government that they would be reimbursed the cost of the facilities mentioned in Article 4 of the Treaty of Alliance. (If Iraq is involved through the Alliance in military operations, a loan and the free supply of war material may also be necessary.) (g) Measures to assist Iraqi Government with their press and in countering enemy propaganda. Transjordan — (h) Before the outbreak of hostilities, £10,000 should be placed at the disposal of the British Resident at Amman for financial assistance to the Amir Abdullah, subsidies to certain tribal Sheikhs, and a subsidy to the local newspaper.■ ) 'O'*. 7 Saudi Arabia — (i) His Majesty’s Government should be prepared to contemplate a subsidy to Ibn Saud, in whatever form and at whatever time His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda recommends such an offer. We suggest an initial payment of not more than £200,000. O') Further measures to provide Ibn Saud with arms, ammunition and military equipment, or with assistance in aviation, should at once be considered in the light of existing circumstances. (k) Assistance in pilgrimage matters. (l) Despatch of Political Officer to Riyadh, if Ibn Saud agreed. (m) Subject to recommendations for His Majesty’s Minister, a certain sum, say, £25,000, might he placed at his disposal to influence leading Saudi-Arabian officials. The Yemen. See Appendix F. Arab States of the Persian Gulf. (n) £4,000 to be placed at disposal of Political Resident at Bushire, for special Intelligence matters, including payments to the Sheikhs if necessary. Propaganda. (o) Steps should be taken now to prepare a comprehensive scheme for war-time propaganda in the Middle East.

SHUCKBURGH, Chairman. Richmond Terrace, aS.IF. 1, February 8, 1939.&gt; » 8 APPENDIX A. Draft Despatch to His Majesty’s Representative in Turkey. Sir P. Lor (line, Angora. Sir, February 1939. I HAVE had under consideration Your Excellency’s secret despatch No. 378 (330/4/G/38) of the 28th July regarding measures which might be adopted to influence Turkey in favour of this country in the event of the United Kingdom becoming involved in a war with a Great Power. 2. I do not intend to deal in the present despatch with the question whether it would be of great value to the United Kingdom that Turkey should enter the war on the side of this country, rather than that she should take up an attitude of benevolent neutrality. Nor do T intend to consider the inducements which might be offered to the Turkish Government to become co-belligerents with His Majesty’s Government. These points will be considered separately, and I propose now to limit my observations in the main to the suggestions and recommendations put forward in paragraphs 6 and 7 of your despatch under reply. 3. I entirely agree with your Excellency that great advantage may be derived from the closest possible diplomatic co-operation with the Turkish Government, immediately on the outbreak of a war in which the United Kingdom is involved, in order to ensure that the two Governments shall pursue a common policy in neighbouring countries, both in Europe and in Asia. I appreciate that frank discussions on these lines would be one method of achieving that reciprocity, upon the importance of which your Excellency rightly lays emphasis in paragraph 12 of your despatch. 4. His Majesty’s Government have also approved your suggestion that, in the event of war, whole-time Service Attaches should at once be attached to His Majesty’s Embassy, and that His Majesty’s Ambassador should be able to tell the Turks that these officers were at their disposal, under his guidance, to discuss any measures of co-operation between the British and Turkish military authorities which the two Governments might consider necessary or useful. 5. I agree, moreover, that an endeavour might be made to ensure, with the co-operation of the Turkish Government and after consultation with them, that the British and Turkish press should speak with one voice. His Majesty’s Government would be willing to authorise His Majesty’s Ambassador to state that, if money were required to promote any form of publicity which the two Governments considered desirable in their mutual interests, a proportionate contribution might be made available from British funds. 6. In paragraph 7 of your despatch you suggest that it might be exceedingly useful if, in the early stages of the war, when merchant shipping may be particularly exposed to hostile action by service vessels, and before His Majesty’s Navy have been able to ensure the complete command of the seas, the Turkish Government were requested to agree, for their part, to allow certain units of British mercantile shipping to be registered under the Turkish flag. I fear that such a project could not be entertained by His Majesty’s Government. Nor is it likely that an offer could be made, as suggested in paragraph 8 of your despatch, to maintain during the period of hostilities the exchange value of Turkish currency. Apart from the financial problems with which His Majesty’s Govern ment are themselves likely to be faced, and the likelihood of requests from other countries to support their currencies. His Majesty’s Government feel that there are overwhelming objections in principle to undertaking indefinite commitments which may involve assuming responsibility for the possibly unsound financial policy of foreign countries over which His Majesty’s Government are not in a position to exercise control. 7. The other suggestions contained in your despatch will be considered in connection with the further examination of the matter referred to in paragraph 2 above. It seems probable, however, that some of them will only require a decisionafter the war has broken out, in view of the circumstances then existing, and ^n the light of any suggestions or requests that may be received from the lurkish Government. APPENDIX B. Draft Despatch to His Majesty’s Representative in Iran. Mr. Seymour, Tehran. Sir, February 1939. I HAVE had under consideration your secret despatch No. 305 (601/3/38) of the 31st August regarding the measures which might be taken, on the outbreak of war between the United Kingdom and a European Power, to influence the Iranian Government in favour of this country. 2. I agree that, in such an emergency, the Iranian Government would at first make every effort to remain completely neutral. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to induce them to adopt an attitude more favourable to this country than that of strict neutrality. It follows therefore that no measures involving financial expenditure on a considerable scale need be contemplated at present with a view to influence the Iranian Government in favour of the United Kingdom on the outbreak of hostilities. 3. I share your view that it will be necessary, on the outbreak of hostilities, to avoid giving the Iranian Government any cause for complaint in the Persian Gulf area, and to avoid, for example, any steps which the Iranian Government might conceivably regard as directed against the legitimate interests of Iranian nationals in Bahrein. I appreciate, too, that steps will have to be taken to avoid giving the Iranian Government any cause for complaint that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is carrying out on Persian soil functions such as are incompatible with his residence in a neutral country. 4. After fully considering your recommendations, His Majesty’s Govern ment have reached the conclusion that the measures to be taken in Iran immediately on the outbreak of war can probably be limited to measures connected with propaganda. They have approved in principle your suggestion that a press attache should at once be sent to Tehran to concern himself with all matters connected with propaganda and with the Iranian press. They have also approved your suggestion that arrangements should now be made whereby news broadcasts in the Persian language can be started immediately on the outbreak of a war, and the British Broadcasting Corporation have already been approached in this connection. 5. His Majesty’s Government appreciate that it might at a later stage be necessary, as the best means of inducing the Iranian Government to maintain a strictly impartial attitude, to contemplate an offer to them of economic or financial assistance. Such assistance might, as you suggest, take the form of railway material or aircraft, although it is evident that in war time His Majesty’s Government would have considerable difficulty in sparing material of this nature, and there are other countries, such as Egypt, Iraq and Turkey, with prior claims in this respect. 6. You have also suggested that assistance to the Iranian Government might take the form of arrangements to supply goods from the United Kingdom, or to finance purchases elsewhere, to take the place of Iran’s imports from the enemy countries. This suggestion is one which will have to be fully considered in the light of the circumstances existing at the time. It would be impossible at present to decide whether His Majesty’s Government would be in a position to supply Iran with the type of goods which she would be most likely to require. It is conceivable, however, that, if political considerations made it desirable! and if the volume of trade were not large, some arrangements might be made whereby Iran could be supplied with certain goods through an export licensing system. [18612]10 APPENDIX C. Draft Despatch to His Majesty's Representative in Iraq. Sir Maurice Peterson, Bagdad. Sir, February 1939. L HAVE had under consideration the report enclosed in your Excellency’s despatch No. 329 (451/3/38) of the 18th July, regarding the measures which might be taken to influence the Iraqi Government in favour of this country in the event of the I nited Kingdom becoming involved in a war with a Great Power. 2. I have noted your observations in paragraph 5 of your report, regarding the measures which might be taken to ensure that Iraq shall implement whole heartedly her obligations under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. As your are aware, steps were taken during the international crisis last September to keep the Iraqi Government fully informed of all developments in the situation, and it is evident that in any future emergency similar arrangements will have to be made to enable the Embassy to keep in close touch with the Iraqi Government concerning the general situation, to such an extent that the Iraqi Government will be unable to claim that they have not been fully consulted. I agree, moreover, with your view that the greatest care will have to be taken to ensure that war does not occur in circumstances which could be held by Iraq to contravene the Covenant of the League or the Pact of Paris. 3. Since the receipt of your despatch under reference, the Iraqi Prime Minister has expressed to Mr. Houstoun-Boswall his earnest hope, as recorded in Bagdad telegram No. 143 of the 29th September, that should the financial position of Iraq suffer from a war, through, for example, the closing of the Mediterranean to merchant vessels (which would mean that no oil could be exported from Kirkuk, with a consequent loss of royalties), or if the economic position of the population should become such that Government assistance should be necessary, the Iraqi Government could look to their allies for aid. The Iraqi Government may be assured, in reply to any similar request during an inter national crisis, that His Majesty’s Government will give their most sympathetic consideration to any request for financial assistance which the Iraqi Government may feel obliged to make in the event of such difficulties arising. 4. In paragraph 6 of your memorandum under reply, you have put forward eight other suggestions which might be of use in case some further measure might be found necessary in order to induce the Iraqi Government to adopt an attitude favourable to this country. Of these measures, points (2) and (8), being merely assurances which would not involve His Majesty’s Government in any more extensive obligations than those at present existing, can be approved without further qualification. You are accordingly authorised, at your discre tion, and if you think that such action would, in fact, assist in influencing the Iraqi Government’s attitude in favour of this country, to give them the following assurances: — (a) A renewal of the undertaking regarding the incidence of expenditure under Article 4 of the Treaty given in the High Commissioner’s letter to the Iraqi Prime Minister, No. 157 of the 23rd November, 1931. {b) An assurance that the use by His Majesty’s Government of the facilities to which they are entitled under Article 4 of the Treaty would in no way prejudice Iraq’s complete independence as a sovereign State. 5. As regards your further suggestion (No. 5) of an offer of a new loan on very easy terms, say £1,000,000 at 2^ per cent., to enable Iraq to meet war expenditure, His Majesty’s Government would, if necessary, be prepared to accord their most sympathetic consideration to such a scheme. It is not, however, clear that Iraq, if the United Kingdom were involved in war, would be obliged herself to incur “ war expenditure.” Your suggestion No. 7, that an offer might be made to furnish Iraq free of charge with the necessary artillery and small arms, ammunition and other military equipment to enable her forces to carry out the work which would devolve upon them under Article 4 of the Treaty of Alliance, would also be favourably considered if the emergency were to arise. It is not,\ 11 however, clear that the Iraqi forces would be required to carry out military operations, at all events at the outset of a European war, and it must further be borne in mind that, if the United Kingdom were at war, it might be difficult, or even impossible, to spare arms and ammunition which would certainly be urgently required elsewhere. 6. The following further suggestions which you have advanced do not, I feel, require an immediate decision at the present stage, since they would not have to be acted upon immediately on the outbreak of war. In some cases, it might be best to wait until definite requests are received from the Iraqi Government; but in each case I think it best to leave it to your Excellency to raise the question after the outbreak of war, if circumstances should appear to you to render it desirable to adopt some such course. These suggestions, which His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to consider further in the event of war, if resubmitted together with an urgent recommendation from your Excellency, are as follows - (1) An undertaking that in the event of victory His Majesty's Government would assist Iraq politically and financially to carry out the project of establishing an Iraqi port, either at Khor Abdullah or on the Bay of Koweit. (2) The cancellation of the outstanding instalments due to His Majesty's Government for the Port of Basra (cost about £270,000). (3) An offer to bear the whole or part of the cost of the sinking fund of the Iraqi State Loan of 1937 (£95,000 a year for about 15 years).. (4) An offer to arrange at the end of the war with a British firm for the building on very favourable terms of one of Iraq's essential major irrigation works. 7. I appreciate that, once the Iraqi Government have been won over to wholehearted co-operation, it will be desirable or necessary to take further measures, for which the Iraqi Government will probably require some financial assistance from His Majesty’s Government. For instance, as you suggest, it would be desirable to endeavour to persuade the Iraqi Government to— (a) Increase the strength of the Military Mission. (Cost: Five officers, about £10,000 a year.) (b) To increase the British advisory staff in the Ministry of the Interior and to appoint British Administrative Inspectors to the chief provincial centres. (Cost: Five officials, £10,000 a year.) (c) To stop trading with the hostile Power. 8. I think, however, that further consideration might usefully be given to the measures which would be required on the outbreak of war to assist the Iraqi Government to control their press, to arrange for the publication of suitable material, and to counter or suppress enemy propaganda. APPENDIX I). Draft Despatch to His Majesty’s Representative in Transjordan. Sir, I HAVE the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your despatch Secret A of the 9th August regarding the measures to be taken in Transjordan in the event of an outbreak of war, and to inform you that the proposals contained in Mr. Hall’s secret despatch of the 23rd October, 1935, have been reconsidered in the light of the observations contained in your despatch under reference. [ 18612 ] D2. It is agreed that the following measures should he taken at the High Commissioner’s discretion either when an outbreak of hostilities becomes imminent, or when hostilities commence :— (i) When it becomes clear that hostilities are imminent, all possible moral support should be given to His Highness the Amir of Transjordan, and authority should be sought to place at the disposal of the British Resident the sum of £10,000 with which to afford His Highness financial assistance and to subsidise tribal sheikhs as considered necessary. Since the principle of the payment of subsidies is accepted, it need not be anticipated that there will be any delay in dealing with a recommendation of this nature. The question of supplying additional funds for this purpose would be dealt with in the same manner and, if desired, at the same time. If the situation should be such as to make the military organisa tion of the tribes the object of the subsidies, as contemplated in the Defence Scheme of 1934, rather than their political appeasement, it would, of course, be desirable that their distribution should be undertaken by the military authorities. (ii) On the actual outbreak of hostilities, undesirable agitators in Trans jordan would be placed in enforced residence in suitable localities under the powers conferred upon the Amir by the Prevention of Crime Law, 1927. (iii) The one newspaper published in Transjordan would be subsidised financially, and it is suggested that the expenditure for this purpose should be debited to the sum of £10,000 to be provided for subsidies under (i) above. 3. In paragraph 2 (v) of his despatch of the 23rd October, 1935, Mr. Hall raised the question of jamming enemy broadcasts in war time, and in paragraph 3 (v) of Mr. Thomas’ secret despatch of the 18th March, 1936, a further communication on this subject was promised. Consideration has been given to the possibility of interfering with broadcasts from hostile stations, and it has been decided that this measure should not be resorted to in time of war save in exceptional circumstances. What would constitute such exceptional circumstances cannot be determined in advance, but would be a matter for an ad hoc decision at the time. 4. I note that the question of the formation of a mobile unit of the Arab Legion for the protection of the pipe-line in Transjordan will be considered by the Military Authorities in connection with the general military measures for the control of defence of Transjordan in time of war. I have, &amp;c. APPENDIX E. Draft Despatch to His Majesty’s Representative in Saudi Arabia. Sir R. Bullard, Jedda. Sir, February 1939. THE suggestions contained in your secret despatch No. 141 of the 7th July, regarding measures which might be taken to influence Saudi Arabia in favour of this country in the event of the United Kingdom becoming involved in a war with a Great Power, have now received the careful consideration of His Majesty’s Government. 2. Except in the event of an attack on the Aden Protectorate by the Imam of the Yemen, or of an attack on the Yemen by some hostile Power should the Imam remain well disposed towards this country, it is unlikely that the military assistance of Ibn Saud, even if obtainable, would be of service to His Majesty’s Government. I am, however, fully aware of the importance of retaining the King’s benevolent neutrality, and I realise that in the face of lavish territorial *. i i T t A ^ offers i obtain they m; the gra 3. could b matte n month 1 militar last re; neutral on sud Majest conside prevail telegra ripe fo should In ord Govern might £ 200 , 0 ' furthei 4. ment si in the ; Britaii the Je( been e&gt; to the rather the pilj would provid 5. light o: of offei on the war su the nec could l: be com 6 .

His Majesty's Government therefore recognise in principle that they may be obliged, at an early stage after the outbreak of hostilities, to authorise the grant of a substantial subsidy to Ibn Baud. 3. The exact time when such an offer should be made, the form in which it could be made most acceptable to His Majesty, and the amount of the subsidy, are matters which, I think, must be left for later decision. In the last war, the monthly subsidy to the Sherif Hussein was granted in return for his active military support, and although I note your view that it may be necessary in the last resort to pay a like sum to Ibn Baud merely in return for his benevolent neutrality, it is by no means certain that, even if a subsidy is necessary, payments on such a large scale need be offered, at all events in the first instance. His Majesty’s Government have therefore decided that all details will have to be considered afresh when the emergency arises in the light of all the circumstances prevailing at the time. His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda should report by telegram, on or after the outbreak of a war, immediately he considers the time ripe for an offer of financial assistance to Ibn Baud, the form in which the offer should be made, and the minimum sum which would, in his opinion, be adequate. In order to give you some indication of the amount to which His Majesty's Government might be prepared to agree, I would suggest that the recommendation might be to the effect that an initial payment should be offered of not more than £200,000, to be followed at intervals, but not necessarily monthly intervals, by further instalments. 4. In paragraph 4 of your despatch you propose that His Majesty’s Govern ment should compensate Ibn Baud for losses arising from the inevitable decline in the annual pilgrimage to Mecca; and in paragraph 10 you suggest that Great Britain should offer to take the place of Egypt in financing the construction of the Jedda-Mecca-Arafat and Jedda-Medina roads. Both these proposals have been examined, but it seems on the whole preferable to expend any sums devoted to the maintenance of Saudi Arabian neutrality in a direct subsidy to the King rather than on the performance of specific services in the country. As regards the pilgrimage, however. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India would doubtless be willing to consider, when the occasion arose, the means of providing shipping for the transport of pilgrims from India to the Hejaz. 5. His Majesty’s Government would also be prepared to consider, in the light of the circumstances existing after the outbreak of hostilities, the possibility of offering to provide Ibn Baud with arms, ammunition and military equipment on the easiest terms possible, though it is doubtful to what extent in time of war such arms and munitions could be made available. I fear, that owing to the necessities of war, it is in the highest degree improbable that any assistance could be offered to Ibn Baud in aviation matters although this point could also be considered further in the light of existing conditions. 6. I approve your suggestion that it would be very valuable if a British Political Officer could be sent at once on the outbreak of war to stay at Riyadh, if Ibn Baud would permit this, in order to explain the situation to him day by day and to help to counteract the enemy propaganda which would be reaching him by wireless and perhaps by other means also. His Majesty’s Government have sanctioned in principle this proposal to send a British Officer to Riyadh as one which might be put to Ibn Baud immediately on the outbreak of war. 7. There are circumstances, especially if it were to be apparent that Ibn Baud were becoming less able to manage personally the affairs of his Kingdom, in which it might be desirable to set aside a certain sum (say £25,000) to be used, if opportunity offered, to influence one or two of the leading Saudi Arabian officials in our favour. His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to consider favourably any proposals to this effect which His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda might wish to put forward after the outbreak of a war, provided that he were satisfied that important results could thereby be obtained. 8. The measures suggested in paragraph 5 of your despatch in connection with the Hasa oil-field, can be further explored when the emergency arises. It seems probable that there would be no reduction in the King’s profits from this source, since the demand for oil would be stimulated bv a war and its price wouldC R H T 672 j M,E.(Oo) 293c COPY IIP. 12, HEASUREh TO IirPLUEITCZ! jililOR PO'.ERS -JID ARAB STATES.

In that preliminary report it was pointed out that measures to influence Minor Powers and Arab States, as envisaged in the foregoing conclusion of the Committee of Imperial Defence, could be considered as falling under two heads (a) Measures required in the event of war or imminent war; (b) Measures which might be taken before the outbreak of war© 3© The measures which might be taken before the outbreak of war were fully dealt with in the preliminary report, which was dated the 13th July, 1938 (Cd.D. Paper No© 1447-3) and has already been considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence© The Sub-Committee do not wish at present to put forward any further recommendations under this head. 4. The present report will therefore deal only with the measures required in the event of v/ar or imminent v/ar; and it has been drawn up in the light of the views and recommendations of His Majesty’s Representatives in the countries under consideration© -1--2' W) 5« ''e have interpreted the terra 'r.iinor Powers and Arab States'* as referring to those Piddle Pastern countries with which the Piddle : ast (Official) Sub-Committee are ordinarily concerned, and the present report will *olierei.ore deal with the follov/ing countries (1) Turkeyo (2) Persia* (3) Iran, (4) Transj or&amp;an* (5) Saudi .^rabia* (6) The Yemeno (7) The Arab States of the Persian Gulf* T 7e have decided not to include Tyypt and the Sudan, partly because those are countries with w rich tee Sub committee are not ordinarily concerned, partly because the problems arising in these countries are very different from those arisiny in the Asiatic territories which we have consid.ered, and partly because the considered views of the local British authorities have required some modification in the liyht of experience pained durine; the international crisis last September, an are on j^ct available in their final form* &gt;o understand:., nowever, that His P.ajesty’s Ambassador in Cairo has already forwarded several reports, and that his further views and recommenda tions will be dealt with on arrival in the usual way by the Foreign Office in consultation with other interested Departments. Effect in A rab Countries of British Policy in Palestine . 6m We feel it necessary at the outset to point out, as an essential part of our report, the strong feeling which exists in all Arab States in connection with British policy in Palestine. It is evident that b 3 ^ far the most important measure which could be taken to influence Arabk II States in favour of the United King’d on; would oc tne modification of our iulestine polic^o c assume unc.t, immedi: tel:/ or. the outbrea 1 : of war, the necessary measures would at once he taken, (if a settlement oy agreci.ient with the Arabs had not already oeen reachea) in 01 cxer to bring about a complete appeasement of Arab opi nion i-- Palestine and in neighbouring countries«, If we fail tnus to regain Arab goodwill at the outset of a war, no other measures which we can recommend will serve to influence Arab States in favour of this countr/o On tne contrary, we shall have run a serious risk of incurring their active hostilitye V/e understand, however, that consideration has already been accorded to tnis problem, and that x_is Majesty’s Government fully appreciate the importance of the point to which v/e have felt compelled to draw attentiono Turkey o 7* In the case of Turkey, -is Majesty’s Government nave already taken certain very important measures to influence that country in our favour in an emergency* The measures taken have been notably successful* Me do not at present wish to recommend any further measures in the way of financial assistance to Turkey in the event of war or imminent war* It would of course be necessary to maintain in such circurnstances the closest diplomatic co-opex &gt; ation with Turkey, to ensure that the two countries puisued ^ common policy in neighbouring countries both in Europe and in Asia* It would likewise be necessary to accord the most sympathetic consideration to any suggestions or requests that the Turkish Government might put to us. The guest ion *. ow for consideration, nowever, is whetner inicre are any measures v/hicli ought to be approved in principle - 3 -© -4- at the present stage. we think that there are two points, neither of great importance, which might he approved now as likely to facilitate close Anglo-Turkish co-operation in the event ox* war* In the first it would in our opinion he desirable on the outbreak of war that whole time Service Attaches should at once be attached to His hajesty*s Embassy in Turkey, and that His ]lajesty’s Ambassador should be able to tell the Turkish authorities that these Officers were at their disposal, under Ids guidance, to discuss any measures of co-operation which the two Governments might consider necessary or useful. Another suggestion which is, we think, worth pursuing is that His Hajesty’s Ambassador might be authorised to discuss frankly with the Turkish Government, in the event of war or imminent war, the measures which might be arranged to ensure that the British and Turkish press should speak with one voice, and that Ids Excellencj/ should be authorised to suggest to the Turkisn Government that, if money were required to promote any form of publicity which the two Governments considered desirable in their mutual interests, His Majesty’s Government would be very willing to make a proportionate contribution. 8. V/e do not intend in the present report to discuss the question whether, in the event of the outbreak of war in Western and Central Europe, we should wish Turkey to enter the war on our side, or to remain a benevolent neutral. It is evident tnat, ii we wished Turkey to become a co— belligeren o, we might have to consider far wider and more important measures to influence her in our favour, but this is a larger issue which falls, we think, beyond the scope of the present report.- 5 - Persia * 9. : 7e think it may he taken for granted that, in the eventuality of a war in Europe, Persia would at first make every effort to remain completely neutral. It is probable that this attitude would he maintained, at any rate in the initial stapee of the conflict, hut might well be changed to our disadvantage, if the progress of the war seemed to offer a safe opportunity for Persia to take by force whatever she wanted in 'die Persian Gulf c Pe see no reason therefore to recommend any measures of importance to influence Persia r s attitude at the outbreak of hostilities, though it might later be necessary to contemplate an offer of economic or financial assistance, as the best means of keeping the Persian Government impartial#- Such assistance might take the form of railway material or aircraft, or else might consist of arrangements to supply goods from the United Kingdom, or to finance purchases elsewhere# to take the place of imports from the enemy countries, • The only measures which we think might usefully be taken immediately on the outbreak of war would be certain measures connected with propaganda, such as the despatch of a press attach^ to Tehran, and the putting into force of arrangements, which would have to be previously organised, for the broadcasting of news in the Persian language, Iraq , 10, It will be remembered that at the time of the recent European crisis, the Iraqi Government, as the allies of His Ilajesty* s Government, spontaneously declared to us their iirm intention of carrying out in full their obligations to us under the Treaty of Alliance, Provided that we are able soon to satisfy Iraqi opinion with regard to our Palestine policy, and provided that Iraq remains convinced of our ability and intention to protect her under theAlliance, it may be hoped that the Iraqi attitude in any future emergency will be equally satisfactory. It is probable, however, that the Iraqi Government will expect to receive from us in return a considerable degree of financial assistance. Last September, for example, the Iraqi Prime i'inister expressed to the British representative in Baghdad his earnest hope that, should the financial position of Iraq suffer from a war, through for example the closing of the Mediterranean to merchant vessels (which would mean that no oil could be exported from Kirkuk, with a consequent loss of royalties), or if the economic position of the population should be such that Government assistance should be necessary, the Iraqi Government could look to us for aid. It proved not to be necessary, before the termination of the emergency period, for His Majesty 1 s Government to reply to this request. !7e recommend, however, that, if any similar request should be received from the Iraqi Government in some future emergency, they should be assured that His Majesty^ Government would give their most sympathetic consideration to any request for financial assistance which the Iraqi Government might feel obliged to make in the event of such difficulties arising. 11. We recommend, moreover, that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad should be authorised to renew an assurance already given to the Iraqi Government in 1^1 regarding the incidence of expenditure in respect of the facilities which, under Article 4 of the Treaty of Alliance, the Iraqi Government would have to place at our disposal in the event of war or the imminent 'threat of war 5 The assurance was to the effect that His Majesty’s Government would indemnify the Iraqi Government against any additional expenditure incurred by them, but would not expect to be asked to pay, H-7- for the movement or accommodation of troops, rates higher than those charged for Iraqi troops, or pay for the use of existing facilities when no additional expense would 'be involved to the Iraqi Government. The renewal of this assurance of 1931 would not, of course, involve i.'.is IvIa;jesty T s Government in greater expenditure than that to which we are already committed^ 12. If there wore any livelihood of Iraq 'being involved, through her alliance with us, in military operations, we think that it would be necessary to contemplate the offer to Iraq of a loan on very easy terms, say £1,000,000 at 2^'/j, to enable Iraq to meet war expenditure. An offer ought also to be made, if possible, to furnish Iraq free of charge with the necessary artillery and small arms ammunition, and other military equipment, to enable her forces to carry out the work which would devolve upon them under the Treaty of Alliance. 13# Y/e have no doubt that further measures involving considerable financial expenditure in Iraq will have to be considered by His majesty's Government as the war proceeds, but we think that it will be best in most cases to wait until definite requests are received from the Iraqi Government before considering the question what further measures will be required. 14. We think, hov/ever, that consideration should be given to the measures which will be required to assist the Iraqi Government to control their press, to arrange for the publication of suitable material, and to counter or suppress enemy propaganda. Transjordan. 15. In Transjordan, as a British mandated territory, conditions are different from those obtaining in the other countries dealt with in the present report. It will be possible, for example, on J :hp, outbreak of hostilities totalie drastic measures against undesiralole agitators. Me believe&gt; however, that it will probably be necessary to afhord financial assistance to the Anir of Transjordan, and perhaps also to subsidise certain tribal Sheikhs* he recommend therefore that the iligh Commissioner for Transjordan should now be instructed that, when it becomes clear that hostilities are imminent, he should seel: authority from His majesty's Government to place at the disposal of the British Resident at Amman the sum of £10,000, with which to afford financial assistance to the itiiiir, and to subsidise tribal Sheikhs as considered necessary# The one newspaper published in Transjordan could also be subsidised out of the £10,000 mentioned above. Addioional funds for the purpose of these subsidies would have to be provided later. Saudi Arabia. 16. In Saudi Arabia, so long as present circumstances remain mor... or less unchanged, the problem is how to maintain Ibn baud’s goodwill. For this purpose, a settlement of the ^olostine problem is essential. The assistance already promised towards the reconstruction of the Ilejaz Railway will be ^ery nelpful, and any further steps to convince Ibn Saud Cxiat ic is to nis advantage to keep on good terms with us should be taken as and when opportunity arises. Me must, however, remember that our enemies are in a position to promise him all he wants in the way of territorial expansion, vitnout cost to themselves. Ibn Saud claims specifically AQ.aoa and La’an, now in Transjordan, and the Jebel Naqsh and the Khor-el-Odeid in the Persian Gulf, which His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India have maintained to be the property of the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. The enemies of Great Britian would no aoubt promise him tne satisfaction of all his claims amainst - 8 -£V -9- Transjordan, and the Arab States on the Persian Gulf, and might indeed promise to assist him in vaster territorial designs at the expense of Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq and the Persian Gulf States. It is improbable that Ibn Saud v/ould in fact accept these suggestions from our enemies, however attractive they might appear to him, unless he was fairly certain that they were going to win the v/ar, and at the beginning of a war his policy would probably be to try to get the best terras for his neutrality. 17. It is therefore to be expected that, at the beginning of the v/ar, Ibn Saud v/ould ask us for the satisfaction of his territorial claims with regard to the Jebel Uaqsh and the Khor-el-Odeid, and possibly also with regard to Aqaba and Ivla*an. If His Majesty’s Government were unable to make any concession on these points, their refusal would drive up the price of Han Saud’s neutrality in other coin. 18. It seems, therefore, that it v/ould be necessary to pay a subsidy, in one form or another, to Ibn Saud in return for his neutrality. Y/e do not think it possible to give in advance even an approximate estimate of the amount which v/ould be required, although the subsidies to the Sharif Hussein during the v/ar, admittedly in return for his active military support, were very large indeed, and no doubt Ibn Saud’s calculations of what he may expect from us v/ill be worked out on some such basis. Tor is it possible to suggest in advance the form in which the offer of a subsidy could be made most attractive to the King. We recommend, therefore, that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda should be informed that, on or after the outbreak of a war, he should report by telegram immediately he considers the time ripe for an offer of financial assistance, the form in which the offer should be made, and the minimum sum which would,ill his opinion, be adequate. It might be indicated to His Majesty's Minister, merely for his personal information and guidance, that His Majesty's Government might be prepared to agree to an initial payment of not more than £200,000, to be followed at intervals by further instalments 19• Other measures, which might be used to supplement the financial measures suggested in the preceding paragraph, might be an offer to help Ibn Saud by providing arms, ammunition and equipment for his regular army, or by an offer of assistance in aviation matters* k special effort ought in any case to be made to keep the pilgrimage running as far as possible, for example, by seeing that lack of shipping shall not prevent any intending pilgrims to Mecca from proceeding on their journey. 20. V/e think it would be very valuable, moreover, if a British Political Officer could be sent to stay at Riyadh, if Ibn Baud would permit this, in order to explain the situation to him day by day, and to help to counteract the enemy propaganda which would be reaching him by wireless and perhaps by other means also. '!e think that a proposal to send an officer to Riyadh might be put to Ibn Saud immediately on the outbreak of war. 21. There are circumstances, especially if it v/ere to be apparent that Ibn Saud were becoming less able to manage personally the affairs of his kingdom, in v/hich it might be desirable to set aside a certain sum (say £25,000) to be used, if opportunity offered, to influence one or two of the leading Saudi Arabian officials in our favour. 7e suggest that His Majesty's Minister might be encouraged to put forward definite recommendations to this effect after the outbreak of a war, provided that he were satisfied that important results could thereby be obtained.The Yemen 22. The Governor of Aden has put forward certain suggestions for influencing the Yemen in our favour, but some of these suggestions are measures which can with advantage be adopted at once before the emergency arises, and have therefore been dealt with separately, 51 while others need only be considered after the outbreak of war.-, We have therefore no recommendations to put forward as regards the Yemen. The Arab States of the Persian Gulf. | 23* During the recent European crisis, the Political Resident at Bushire telegraphed that it was essential for him to have a fund at his disposal for special intelligence in the Arab States of the G-ulf. This fund was required not only for obtaining information, but for special payments to the Sheikhs and others to keep them on our side in case of necessity. We think that a sura of £4,000 might be devoted to this purpose immediately after the outbreak of a war, and that the allocation of t is expenditure, as between the United Kingdom and India, should be determined in '■—r® 1 *««* accordance with the general principleejgoverningjthe all ocation of_ j7&amp;r expenditure- between the United Kingdom , and India. Propaganda* 24. In the precedi ng paragraphs one or two measures connected with propaganda are recommended. These are for the most part based on suggestions received from His Majesty's Representatives in the territories concerned. But it is presumed that t \ose responsible for the planning of a Ministry of Information v/ill prepare a comprehensive scheme for propaganda in v/ar time in the area with which this Report is concerned, in consultation v/ith the Foreign Office, India Office, Colonial Office and Service Departments, is suggested that this should be undertaken immediately. *Paper No. M.E.(O) 291. -li lt-12- summary of RYOori: :::iiD^Tiors. 25^ Our recommenclations, as described above, may be sur.imarised as follows: (Trie 8.ction recomi'iiended. is intended, unless otherwise stated, to be taken immediately war has broken out).

Sir ?• Loraine, January, 1939* iJTGOPA. Sir, I have had under consideration Your Excellency's secret despatch no. 378 (330/4/G/38) of the 28th July regarding measures v/hich might he adopted to influence Turkey in favour of this country in the event of the United Kingdom becoming involved in a war with a Great Power. 2. I do not intend to deal in the present despatch with the question whether it would be of great value to the United Kingdom that Turkey should enter the war on the side of this country, rather than that she should take up an attitude of benevolent neutrality. Nor do I intend to consider the inducements which might be offered to the Turkish Government to become co-belligerents with His Majesty's Government® These points v/ill be considered separately, and I propose now to limit my observations in the main to the suggestions and recommendations put forv/ard in paragraphs 6 and 7 of your despatch under reply. 3® I entirely agree with Your Excellency that great advantage may be derived from the closest possible diplomatic co-operation with the Turkish Government, immediately on the outbreak of a war in which the United Kingdom is involved, in order to ensure that the two Governments shall pursue a common policy in neighbouring countries both in Europe and in Asia. I appreciate that frank discussions on these lines would be one method of achieving that reciprocity, upon the importance of which Your Excellency rightly lays emphasis in paragraph 12 of your despatch.-15- 4. His Majesty’s Government naive also approved your suggestion that, in the event of war, whole time Service Attaches should at once he attached to His iiajesty’s Embassy, and that His I.Iajesty's Ambassador should be able to tell the Turks that these officers were at their disposal, under his guidance, to discuss any measures of co-operation between the British and Turkish military authorities which the two Governments might consider necessary or useful* 5* I agree, moreover, that an endeavour might be made to ensure, with the co-operation of the Turkish Government and after consultation with them, that the British and Turkish press should speak with one voice- His I‘ajesty ! s Government would be willing to authorise His Majesty’s Ambassador to state th.t, if money were required to promote any form of publicity which the two Governments considered desirable in their mutual interests, a proportionate con tribution ight be made available from British funds. 6. In paragraph 7 of your despatch you suggest that it might be exceedingly useful if, in the early stages of the war, when merchant shipping may be particularly exposed to hostile action by service vessels, and before His Majesty's Navy have been able to ensure the complete command of the seas, the Turkish Government were requested to agree, for their part, to allow certain units of British mercantile shipping to be registered under the Turkish flag. I fear that such a project could not be entertained by His Majesty’s Government. Nor is it likely that an offer could be made, as suggested in paragraph 8 of your despatch, to maintain during the period of hostilities the exchange value of Turkish currency. Apart from the financial problems with which His Majesty’s Government are themselves likely to be faced, and the likelihood of reguests from other countriesto support their currencies, Kis Itajesty's Governraent feel that there are overwhelming objections in principle to undertaking indefinite commitments which may involve assuming responsibility for the possibly unsound financial policy of foreign countries over which His majesty’s Government are not in a position to exercise control. 7. The other suggestions contained in your despatch v/ill be considered in connection with the further examination of the matter referred to in paragraph 2 above* It seems probable, however, that some of them will only require a decision after the war has broken out, in view of the circumstances then existing, and in the light of any suggestions or requests that may be received from the Turkish Government. -16- f * —January, 1939 APrUHDIX B, PERSIA. Mr. Seymour, TEHRAN. Sir, I have had under consideration your secret despatch No. 305 (601/5/38) of the 31st August regarding the measures which might be taken, on the outbreak of war between the United Kingdom and a European lower, to influence the Iranian Government in favour of this country. 2. I agree that, in such an emergency, the Iranian Government would at first make every effort to remain completely neutral. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to induce them to adopt an attitude more favourable to this country than tlw.t of strict neutrality. It follows therefore that no measures involving financial expenditure on a considerable scale need be contemplated at present with a view to influence the Iranian Government in favour of the United Kingdom on the outbreak of hostilities. 3. I share your view that it v/ill be necessary, on the outbreak of hostilities, to avoid giving the Iranian Government any cause for complaint in the Persian Gulf area, and to avoid, for example, any steps which the Iranian i Government might conceivably regard as directed against the/interests of Iranian nationals in Bahrein. I X appreciate too that steps will have to be taken to avoid giving the Iranian Government any cause for complaint that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is carrying out on Persian soil functions such as are incompatible with his residence in a neutral country.4* ...fter fully considering your reco:.v.~enc.ations, ills Majesty’s G-overnment have reached the conclusion that the measures to he taken in Iran immediately on the outbreak of war can probably be limited to measures connected with propaganda° They have approved in principle your suggestion that a press attach^ should at once be sent to Tehran to concern himself with all matters connected with propaganda and with the Iranian press. They have also approved your suggestion that arrangements should now be made whereby news broadcasts in the Persian language can be started immediately on the outbreak of a war, and the Tritisli Broadcasting Corporation have already been approached in this connection* 5. his Majesty's Government appreciate that it might at a later stage be necessary, as the best means of inducing the Iranian Government to maintain a strictly impartial attitude, to contemplate an offer to them of economic or financial assistance.. ouch ssistance might, as you suggest, take the form of railway material or aircraft, although it is evident thet in war time his Majesty's Government would have considerable difficulty in sparing material of this nature, and there are other countries, such as Egypt, Iraq, and Turkey, with prior claims in this respect. 6. You have also suggested that assistance to the Iranian Government might thke the form of arrangements to supply goods from the United Kingdom, or to finance purchases elsewhere, to take the place of Iran's imports from the enemy countries* This suggestion is one which will have to be fully considered in the light of the circumstances existing at the time* It would be impossible at present to decide whether His Majesty's Government would be in a position to supply Iran with the type of goods which she would be most likely to require-&gt; It is conceivable, however, that, if political considerations made it desirable, and if the volume of trade were not large, some arrangements might be made where by Iran could be supplies with certain goods through an export'1 APPEEDIX C January, 1939. Sir i.xciurice Peterson, BAGHDAD. Sir, I have had under consideration the report enclosed in Your Excellency ? s despatch ITOo 329 (451/3/38) of the 18th July, regarding the measures v/hich might he taken to influence the Iraqi Government in favour of this country in the event of the United Kingdom becoming involved in a war with a Great Power. 2. I have noted your observations in paragraph 5 of your report, regarding the measures which might be taken to ensure that Iraq shall implement wholeheartedly her obligations under the Anglo-Iraqi 'Treaty of Alliance. As you are aware, steps were taken during the international crisis last September to keep the Iraqi Government fully informed of all developments in the situation, and it is evident that in any future emergency similar arrangements will have to be made to enable the Embassy to keep in close touch with the Iraqi Government concerning the general situation, to such an extent that the Iraqi Government will be unable to claim that they have not been fully consulted. I agree moreover with your view that the greatest care will have to be taken to ensure th. t war does not occur in circumstances which could be ' eld by Iraq to contravene the Covenant of the Loagne or the Pact of Paris. 3. Since the receipt of your despatch under reference, the Iraqi Prime Minister has expressed to Mr. Ileustoun-Boswall his earnest hope, as recorded in Baghdad telegram Ho. 143 of 29th September, that should the financial position of-20- Iraq suffer from a war, through.-for example the closing of the he&amp;iterranean to merchant vessels, (which would mean that no oil could be exported from hirkuk, with a consequent loss of royalties), or if the economic position of the population should become such that Government assistance should be necessary, the Iraqi Government could look to their allies for aide The Iraqi Government may be assured, in reply to any similar request during an international crisis, that his I.ajesty’s Government will give their most sjmipathetic consideration to any request for financial assistance which the Iraqi Government may feel obliged to make in the event of such difficulties arising# 4# In paragraph 6 of your memorandum under reply, you have put forward eight other suggestions which might be of use in case some further measure might be found necessary in order to induce the Iraqi Government to adopt an attitude favourable to this country. Of these measures, points (2) and (8), being merely assurances which would not involve His Ilajesty's Government in any more extensive obligations than those at present existing, can be approved without further qualification# You are accordingly authorised, at your discretion, and if you think that such action would in fact assist in influencing the Iraqi Government’s attitude in favour of this country, to give them the following assurances: (a) A renewal of the undertaking regarding the incidence of expenditure under Article 4 of the Treaty given in the High Commissioner's letter to the Iraqi Prime finister, lb® 157 of 23rd November, 1931# (b) An assurance that the use by His majesty’s Govern ment of the facilities to which they are entitled under Article 4 of the Treaty would in no way pre judice Iraq’s complete independence as a sovereign State.-2 5. As regards .your further suggestion (lTo« 5) of an offer of a neu loan on very easy terms, say .11,000,000 at 2-feTo, to enable Iraq to meet war expenditure, his ajesty's Government would, if necessary, be prepared to accord their most sympathetic consideration to such a scheme. It is not, however, clear that Iraq y if the United Kingdom were involved in war, would be obliged herself to incur 'war expenditure'. Your suggestion ho, 7, that an offer might be made to furnish Iraq free of charge with the necessary artillery and small arms, ammunition and other military equipment to enable her forces to carry out the worh which would devolve upon them under in?tide 4 of the Treaty of Alliance, would also be favourably considered if the emergency were to arise. It is not, nowever, clear that the Iraqi forces would be required to carry out military operations, at all events at the outset of a European war, and it must further be borne in .and that, if the United Kingdom were at war, it might be difficult, or even impossible, to spare arms and ammunition which would certainly be urgently required elsewhere. 6. The following further suggestions which you have advanced do not, I feel, require an immediate decision at the present stage, since they would not have to be acted upon immediately on the outbreah of war. In some cases, it might bo best to wait until definite requests are receivedfron the Iraqi Government; but in each case I think it best to leave it to Your Excellency to raise the question after the outbreak of war, if circumstances should appear to you to render it desirable to adopt some such course. These suggestions, which His majesty's Govern lent would be prepared to consider further in the event of war, if resubmitted together with an urgent recommendation from Your Excellency, are as follows:- IC*-22- (l) An undertaking thc.t in the event of victory Aia iiajesty's Govenxient would aesist Iraq, politically and financially to carry out the project of establishing an Iraqi port, either at Khor Abdullah or on the Bay of Kov/eit. (2) The cancellation of the outstanding instalments due to His Hajesty’s Government for the Port of Basra (cost about £270,000), (3) An offer to be^.r the whole or part of the cost of the sinking fund of the Iraqi Gtate Loan of 1S37 (£96,000 a year for about 15 years)* (4) An offer to arrange at the end of the war with a British firm for the building on very favourable terms of one of Iraq’s essential major irrigation works. I appreciate that, once the Iraqi Government have been won over to wholehearted co-operation, it will be desirable or necessary to take further measures, for which the Iraqi Government will probably require some financial assitance from His Hajesty’s Government. For instance, as you suggest, it would be desirable to endeavour to persuade the Iraqi Government to: (a) Increase the strength of the H.ilitary Mission (Cost: Five officers: about £10,000 a year). (b) To increase the British advisory staff in the Ministry of the Interior and to appoint British . dministra- tivo Inspectors to the chief provincial centres. (Cost: Five officials: £10,000 a year)* (c) To stop trading with the hostile lower* 8* I think, however, that further consideration ight usefully be given to the measures which would be required on the outbreak of war to assist the Iraqi Government to control their press, to arrange for the publication of suitable materia -1 and to counter or suppress enemy propaganda.- 23 - * APPENDIX D T RAN S - J ORDAE Sir, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your despatch Secret A, of the 9th August regarding the measures to he taken in Trans-Jordan in the event of an outbreak of v/ar, and to inform you that the proposals contained in Mr. Hall T s Secret despatch of the 23rd of October, 1935, have been reconsidered in the light of the observations contained in your despatch under reference. 2. It is agreed that the following measures should be taken at the High Commissioner’s discretion either when an outbreak of hostilities becomes imminent, or when hostilities commence:- (i) When it becomes clear that hostilities are imminent, all possible moral support should be given to His Highness the Amir of Trans-Jordan and authority should be sought to place at the disposal of the British Resident the sum of £10,000 with which to afford His Highness financial assistance and to subsidise tribal sheikhs as considered necessary. Since the principle of the payment of subsidies is accepted, it need not be anticipated that there will be any delay in dealing with a recommendation of this nature. The question of supplying additional funds for this purpose would be dealt with in the same manner and, if desired, at the same time. If the situation should be such as to make the military organisation of the tribes the object of themmsubsidies, as contemplated in the Defence eenemc- o. 1934, rather than their political appeasement, it v/onlu . -i -hiiein distribution snoula 'bo of course be desiraale ^nen u^oux undertaken by the military authorio*c,oo (ii) on the actual outbreak cf dostilities, undesirable agitators in Trans- Jordan would be placed in enforced residence in suitable localities under the powers conferred upon rhe nrnir by one P./eenuio.i cf Crime Law 1917o (iii) The one nonspa x j^ ixi would be subsidised facially and it is suggested that the expenditure lor this purpose suoulft i-o c - w- the sum of 310,000 to be provided for subsidies under (i) above* e In paragraph* 2(y/} cf ms aespaach ox October, 1935, Hr* hall raised the question cf jamjmng ■nemy broadcasts in war time i; ad .‘.n e.. 0 _ t-ph d v v) ir.

His Majesty^ Government have therefore decided that all details will have to be considered afresh when the emergency arises in the light of all the circumstances prevailing at the tinie c His majesty’ s Representative at JeGGa should report by telegram, on or after the outbreak of a war, immediately he considers the tine ripe for an offer of financial assistance to Ibn Saud, the form in which the offer should be ma.de, and the minimum sum -liich would, in his opinion, be adec_uate 0 In order to give you some indication of the amount to which His Hajesty’s Government might be prepared to agree, I would suggest that the recommendation might be te the effect that an initial payment should be offered of net more than £ 200,000 to be followed at intervals, but not necessarily monthly intervals, by further instalments*, 4* In paragraph 4 of your despatch, you propose that His Hajesty’s Government should compensate Ibn Saud for losses arising from the inevitable decline in the annual Pilgrimage to Mecca; and in paragraph 10 you suggest that Great Britain should iffor to take the pi.ce of Bgypt in financing the construction of the Jedda-Hecca~Arafat and Jedda-Hedina roads-. Both these proposals have been examined, but it seems on the whole preferable to expend any sums devoted to the maintenance of Saudi Arabian neutrality in a direct subsidy to the King rather than on the performance of specific services in the country. As regards the pilgrimage, however, His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India would doubtless be willing to consider, when the occasion arose, the means of providing- shipping for the transport of pilgrims from India to the- 27 - Heo'az 9 5* His Hajesty’s Government would also He prepared to consider, in the lipht od the circiWiistances existing after the outbreak of hostilities, the possibility of offering to provide Ibn Baud with arms ammunition and military equipment on the easiest terms possible, though it is doubtful to what extent in time of war such arms and munitions could be made available,, I fear, that owing to the necessities of war, it is in the highest degree improbable that any assistance could be offered to Ibn Baud in aviation matters although this point could also be considered furuher in tne lignt oj. existing conditions. 5 , I approve your su gestion that it would be very valuable if a British Political Officer could be sent at once on the outbreak of war to stay at Riyadh, if Ibn Baud would permit this, in order to explain the situation to him day by day and to help to counteract the enemy propaganda which would be reaching him by wireless and perhaps by other means also&lt;&gt; His majesty’s Government have sanctioned in principle this proposal to send a British Officer to Riyadh as one which might be put to Ibn Baud immediately on the outbreak of war* 7 . There are circumstances, especially if it were to be apparent that Ibn Baud were becoming less able to manage personally the affairs of his Kingdom, in union it might be desirable to set aside a certain sum (say £25,000) to be used, if opportunity offered, to influence one or two of the leading Saudi Araoian officials in our favour* His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to„ — 00113 ider favouraoly any proposals to this effect which His Majesty's Representative at Jedda mipht wish xo ...ut forward after the outbreak of a war, provided that lie were satisfied that important results could thereby be obtained* Co The measures suggested in paragraph 5 of your despatch in connection with the Kasa oil-field, can be further explored when the emergency arises* It seems probable that there would be no reduction in the King T s profits from this source, since the demand for oil would be stimulated by a war and its price would rise accordingly* Moreover, it is unlikely that the working of the liasa oil-field would be disturbed by military operationso His Majesty’s Government would certainly be prepared to consider in case of need how far they could help in providing transport for the American staff of the oil-field, and for the necessary material*aiCCR^T. 1 1959 J J«nu??ry, 19?-9* I oncloBo « copy of o dcft!&gt;«tch which we hove sent to th*’ Ooreroor of Aden rerr^rding the laeHsuros to be te&lt;en to influence the Yenen in our fevour on the outbreak of ^ r nr. ‘i* You will i^co.llect th^t thie despatch was to be considered ns n dreft with the 'Report an Kcesures to Influence i^inor Powers end 4 r^b $tntee% but after consul tine the Porcign Office, re have sent it without writing for the report, re it seemed a pity to hold up notion on pcrsrrmph *? of the despatch.

M.E.(O) 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277 and 280. After full discussion the following conclusions were recorded. CONCLUSIONS. (A) Ceneral . THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed:- (1) That a draft report to the Committee of Imperial Defence containing a brief summary of its recommendations should be prepared in the Foreign Office, and circulated in draft to the other Departments concerned. (2) This report should be accompanied by draft despatches to H.M. representatives in Turkey, Persia, Iraq. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which should be prepared in the Foreign Office and circulated in draft to the other Departments concerned. Similar draft despatches to H.M. High Commissioner in Transjordan and to the Governor of Aden (qua the Yemen) should be prepared in the ColoniBl Oftice, and circulated to the other Departments concerned. These drafts should, when necessary, be the subject of inter departmental discussion. (3) The covering report should mention, inter ali a, the serious effect which the situation in Palestine is having in many of the countries concerned, and the special position of Iraq and Egypt owing to their Treaties of Alliance with this country. (4) That the discussions should cover not only the hypothetical case of a war against Italy, but also the situation which may arise from the present European crisis, v/hether or not Italy is a belligerent. -1--2- The following considerations as regards the despatch of the Keport to Sgypt were agreed to:- The draft despatch to H.M. Ambassador in Cairo should empower his Excellency to take certain measures if and when an emergency arises, without being obliged to refer home for instructions. The observations of the Board of Trade would be required as regards the suggestion for the disposal of the Egyptian cotton crop, and certain other information required, e.g. the measures to be applied to control the Cairo btock Exchange, would be sought from the Departments concerned. it was suggested that, in the list of measures which the Ambassador should be empowered to adopt, some might be placed high on the list, to be used immediately, while others would only be used if the Ambassador were compelled to resort to them. Their employment would, however, be left to the Ambassador’s discretion. A further point was raised to the effect that, in the event of war, as few British officials as possible should be recalled from Egypt for service in England, as their presence in Egypt would be of serious importance. As regards the anti-aircraft defences of Cairo and Alexandria, the bub-Committee were informed that this question was already under consideration by the Foreign Office and the War Office. It was, however, necessary to emphasise the importance of taking effective measures under this heading as soon as possible, in view of the danger to be apprehended as a result of aerial bombardment of a volatile and hysterical population. (C) The Yemen . It was agreed that presents might be given to the Imam and important Yemeni officials on Moslem festivals. The Colonial Office would consider the possibility of providing the money to enable such presents to be made without waiting for an emergency to arise. Money might also be provided for hospital equipment. The other measures suggested by the Governor of Aden, e.g. supply of arms and military advisers, should be further considered when the emergency arose.(D) baud! Arabia . It was agreed that the provision of a subsidy to Ibn i^aud v/ould probably be necessary, but that the amount of the subsidy could only be determined by circumstances, bir R. Bullard should be instructed to raise the question by telegram when he considered the moment opportune to make an offer. bir R. Bullard might be authorised to spend a sum not exceeding £25,000 to be used on the outbreak of war to influence one or two of the leading baud! officials in our favour. (E) Iraq . It was decided that the following suggestions might be considered in a special category as worthy of acceptance:- (a) A renewal of the undertaking to indemnify Iraq for expenditure incurred in the provision of the facilities mentioned in Article 4 of the Treaty of 1930. (b) An offer of a loan on easy terms (say £1 million at 2^&gt;b) to cover Iraq’s war expenditure, if any. (c) An offer to furnish Iraq free of charge with munitions and. anti-aircraft equipment as far as these are available. (P) Turkey . It was agreed to recommend the appointment of whole-time bervice Attaches at Angora on the outbreak of war. borne discussion took place regarding the desirability of Turkey remaining neutral, or of her entering the war as an ally of the United Kingdom. If it v/ere desired that Turkey should enter the war as an ally of the United Kingdom, it would be expedient (a) for His Majesty’s Government to offer to protect the Turkish ports and coast-line as far as possible. (b) that the practicability of absorbing Turkish exports should be considerea in consultation with the Board of Trade.(o) that consideration should he given to the question of the future of the Italian Dodecanese Islands, and the possibility of discussing their demilitarisation or future ownership with Turkey and Greece in case of victory* (G) Persia . It was agreed that the Foreign office would consider further the question of making preparations to begin news broadcasts in Persian immediately on the outbreak of war. The Board of Trade should be consulted regarding the possibility of offering to finance or supply Persian imports in compensation for those lost owing to the war. 2.

WEBB. Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1. 22nd September, 1938Suggest ed Measures to Influence Minor Powers and ifmb States in favour of Great Britain in the Svewt of War. The following proposals have been made by His Majesty's Representatives in Turkey, Persia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq., Egypt find the Yemen regarding measures likely to influence those countries in favour of Great Britain. In the cases of Turkey, Persia, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, the purpose of these measures would be to secure at any rate the benevolent neutrality of the Government in the face of intrigues and propaganda promoted by the enemy. In the cases of Iraq and Sgypt, the aim is to ensure that the Governments will be ready to implement the Anglo-Iraqi and Anglo-Egyptian Treaties of Alliance. Political and Diplomatic action Io Turkey (a) His Majesty's Government might offer in the case of vic tory to press for the demolition of the fortifications in the Dodecanese, and to discuss with the Turkish and Greek Governments the question of the ultimate ownership of the islands. (b) The problem of guarding the overland routes from the Persian Gulf to Turkey, and of ensuring a supply of oil to Turkey, might be discussed immediately v/ith the Turkish Government. (c) His Majesty's Government might, on the outbreak of war, offer to transfer to Turkey the Italian allotment of the Mosul oil-fields. (N.B. His Majesty's Representative in Turkey prefaces his recommendations by suggesting that in the case of Turkey it will be wise to treat the matter on a basis of reciprocity, /e should not make the mistake of giving only, but should also be anxious to receive assistance from Turkey; and any suggestions we may make to the Turkish Government should be more concerned with the coordination of British and Turkish efforts for a common end than with the direct assistance of a powerful Britain to a weak Turkey. Sir P. Loraine2. M # /V Sir P. Loraine further proposes that he may be authorised to discuss the situation immediately and frankly with the Turkish ^vemment, in particular as regards coordination of diplomatic action with the Near and Middle Eastern States. He observes that Turkey' s value in maintaining the neutrality of the Balkan and Saadabad Ententes cannot be over-estimated and that the strategic importance of Smyrna Harbour to the British Navy is worthy of consideration. Its value might, in fact, turn the balance in favour of bringing Turkey into the war as an ally rather than assistiqgi'xjr to maintain her neutrality. He suggests that immediate enquiries might be made of the Turkish Government regarding the possibility of British merchant ships being allowed to register under the Turkish flag if Turkey remains neutral.) II. Persia (a) Every effort should be made to avoid outraging Persian susceptibilities in Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms. (b) The Residency should be moved as soon as possible from Persian soil, in order to remove one probable cause of friction. (His Majesty's Representative adds that in order to forestall any designs which the Persian Government may have on the Arab States in the Persian Gulf, it will be necessary for the Royal Navy to retain sufficient ships in the Gulf to assure the maintenance of control). ( III. Saudi Arabia His Majesty's Representative points out that it is impossible for Great Britain, but easy for her enemies, to offer Ibn Saud the territorial gains which he is anxious to obtain, e.g„ Akaba and Ma’an, Jebel Nakhsh and Fhor-el-Odeid. The question of the Khor-el-Odeid is already under active consideration. IV. Iraq • • •3. IV. Iraq (aj In accordance with Article IV of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty 1930, Great Britain already has the right to enjoy all facilities and assistance on Iraqi territory in the event of war. It is there fore of major importance to prevent the enemy from persuading the Iraqi Government not to honour its Alliance with this country. For this reason: (i) The Iraqi Government should be informed and consulted on matters of international importance likely to lead to war, so that they may not be able to contend that, ov/ing to the lack of fall and frank consultation before war was declared, Article IV is not binding; (ii) The Iraqi Delegate to the League of nations should be induced to vote for a Resolution on the war which puts Great Britain in the right. (b) An assurance should be given that the use by His Majesty's Government of the facilities to which they are entitled under Article IV of the Treaty would in no way prejudice Iraq's indepen dence as a sovereign State. (c) The British Advisory Staff in the Ministry of the Interior should be increased, and British Administrative Inspectors should be appointed to the chief provincial centres. The cost of five extra officials is estimated at £10,000 a year. (d) A settlement in Palestine satisfactory to the Arabs is essential if the goodwill of Iraq is to be retained. V. Egypt (a) A display of force will be necessary in order to convince the Egyptians that Great Britain is likely to be victorious, and to counteract any panic resalting from Italian air raids or from initial successes of the Italians in the ’/estern desert. (bj As in Iraq, a solution of the Palestine problem satis factory to the Arabs would remove a fertile source of enemy propaganda. (c) • • ©(c) Liaison Officers and iclitical Advisers should he appointed to organise the Bedouins, the police, and the Civil Administration. (dj The King might he assured of our readiness to support him on the throne if he cooperated wholeheartedly with us. (e) A close watch should he kept on German and Italian resi dents in order to prevent sabotage. (f) Ext:a medical assistance should he furnished to the Egyptian Government, as the investigations of the British Resources Committee have shown that there is likely to he a shortage of hospital accommodation and of medical supplies. (The Embassy would also he grateful for information regarding measures to he taken in connexion with: (1; Brnoon exchange control (2) The control cf shipping. (3) The internment of enemy nationals, vessels and aircraft, and the confiscation and custody of enemy property and ■businesses.) VI. The Yemen It would he advisable to maintain British forces in the Red Sea adequate to 'prevent the intrusion of other pov/ers into South Arabia, since the Yemenis are certain to he impressed by a visible display of power. It is pointed out that many of the measures suggested with regard to the Yemen have already been adopted by the Italians in time of peace, and it is therefore suggested that they should he put into force now, before the outbreak of war, in order to make up some of the lost ground. Economic assistance..Economic Assistance I. Turkey (a; The readiness of His Majesty's Government to support the Turkish currency in case of war should he intimated to the Turkish Government. (b) We might express our willingness zo taice from Turkey those exports which had been deprived of their normal markets owing to war conditions. II. Pers ia (a) His Majesty's Government should offer to make up the loss to Persia which world be entailed by the interruption of her imports from the enemy countries either by financing their purchases else where, or by supply from the United Kingdom. This suggestion amounts to granting a subsidy to Persia which it is estimated would cost about £1,000,000, but it is pointed out that no suggestion of a loan should be made, doubtless because the Shah considers such an expedient to be humiliating. (b) 7e might offer to provide railway material to assist in completing the Shah's project of railway development. III. Saudi Arabia . (a) A subsidy might be paid to Ibn Saud on the scale of that given to King Hussein during the last War, v/hich apparently amounted to £200,000 a month. (Sir R. Bullard considers that we should begin by demanding military assistance in return for the payment of this subsidy). (b) 7e might assist Ibn Saud to maintain the annual pilgrimage by providing shipping transport for the pilgrims, and compensate him for financial losses resulting from a diminution in the number of pilgrims. (c) 7e might assist in the exploitation of the Hasa oil-field by providing shipping and material, giving passages to American employees, and if necessary by helping to absorb the output of oil,or by compensating Ibn Sand directly for any loss resulting from a falling-off in sales. (d) Our assistance should be given to repair the Hejaz Railway. (This has already been agreed). (e) We might agree to finance Jedda-Medina and Jedda-Mecca road-building projects (at a cost of about £245,000, some of which might be recoverable). IV. Ira q (a) Great Britain might promise to protect Iraq's exports of oil and raw materials. (b) Compensation might be provided for the loss of oil royal ties attributed to the war. (c) Great Britain might promise help for the construction cxf^er the war of a port on the Bay of Koweit, connected by rail to Basra. (d) A reaffirmation might be given of the 1951 Undertaking that His Majesty's Government would indemnify the Iraqi Government., against any additional expenditure incurred in the provision of facilities mentioned in article IV of the Treaty (i.e. the use oi railways, rivers, ports, aerodromes and means of communication). (e) he might offer to cancel the outstanding debt due to .His Majesty’s Government for the Port of Basra. This would amount to a gift of about £2/0,000. (f) We might offer to bear the whole or cart of the interest and sinking fund of the Iraqi 1957 Loan. This would cosc £95,000 per annum for 15 years. (g) We might offer to arrange at the end of the war for a British firm to construct some major Iraqi irrigation work (e,g. Hie Habbanniyah Escape) on very favourable terms (at a cost of £400,000). (h) We should take steps to prevent trade with any hostile Power, presumably by offering to compensate Iraqi traders for any losses entailed thereby.((i) An additional possibility, not mentioned by His Majesty's Representative is that we might wipe out the long-standing and irritating question of the date-gardens of the Sheikhs of Howeit and Monammerah by renouncing all further claims, both as regards possession and taxation, against the Ir qi Government; and at the same time (a) pay the Sheikhs or their heirs for past taxation losses and (b) offer to purchase the properties outright at a generous figure thereafter disposing of the properties as best we could. This might incidentally be a useful step vis-h-vis the Sheikh of Koweit). V. Egypt . (a) Everything must be done to ensure the disposal of the Egyptian and Sudanese cotton crop, i.e. His Majesty's Government must be prepared to buy the whole crop at current Liverpool prices. (b) In the case of the Sudan, a subsidy may be necessary to provide plentiful and cheap sugar. (c) The Egyptian currency may need to be supported. (d) i/e might offer to supply shipping for the transport of Egyptian sea-borne commerce. VI. T he Yemen It is stated that any of the following offers would be appreciated by the Yemeni Government: (a) To irrigate a locality in the Yemen. (b) To dig Artesian wells. (c) To equip hospitals. (It is estimated that £5,000 would suffice for this). Military Assistance I. Turkey (a) whole-time Service Attaches should at once be attached tr the Embassy at Angora and might be placed at the disposal of the Turkish Government in all matters relating to the military co operation of the two Governments. (b) ...0. (Id; British naval protection might Be given to Turkish ports and coastline communications* (o'; Arms and munitions should he supplied to Turkey on the easiest possible terms. (d) Ae should do our best to supply technical assistance for Turkey. II. P sr sia The best method of winning the favour of the Shah would be to provide aircraft for the Persian Air Force. III. S au di_ Ambia (a) Arms should be supplied for Ibn Saud' s new Regular Army. (b) A Military Officer of political experience might be stationed at Riyadh to explain the military situation to the King and to help to counteract enemy propaganda. (c) It is worth considering whether it might be possible in time of war to offer assistance to the Saudi Air Force, although this assistance has been refused in peacetime on the cround of incompetence in that Air Force. IV. Traa (a) To enable Iraq to carry out the ^nglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, it is suggested that a supply of ammunition might be granted to her free of charge. (b) Convincing preparations should be made to show that Great Britain would fully protect Iraq from attack, especially by air. Anti-aircraft equipment should also be provided if future aerial developments were to bring Bagdad within effective range of the Italian air bases in Libya, (c) The strength of the Military Mission might be increased. An extra five officers would cost about £10,000 a year. V. Kgypt (a) The British authorities should take in hand the aerial defence of Cairo and Alexandria. (b) ..9 * (b) His Majesty’s Government should he prepared to purchase for the Egyptian Government anus and munitions which His Majesty's Government were themselves unable to supply (N.B., however, that E^pt is already being supplied as generously as possible). (c) Liaison Officers should be supplied for the purpose of organising the Bedouins. VI. The Yemen (a) The provision of military advisors would be profitable. (b) Arms and munitions should only be supplied to the Govern ment if the Yemen came into the war on our side. (c) Offers to fortify the coast, to build defensive works, or to provide anti-aircraft material would be welcomed by all if the Yemeni Government would accept them. Propaganda I. Turkey While opposed to any attempt to buy the Turkish press, Sir P. Loraine suggests that if money were required to promote any form of publicity which the two Governments considered desirable in their mutual interests, His Majesty's Government should make a pro portionate contribution. II. Persia (a) It will be necessary to maintain intensive British pro paganda in Persia in order to prevent the Government being bribed into the opposite camp by the promise of receiving advantages in the Persian Gulf. (b) Wireless propaganda should begin immediately on the out break of war, and plans should be drawn up in advance. (c) As the press is entirely controlled by the Government, favourable propaganda could only be obtained by the good offices of the Persian Government. It is therefore suggested that a British press officer should be appointed to keep in touch with the Agencc Pars and to counteract enemy attempts to influence the Persian Government' .10. Government against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and other British interests. (d) This officer could concern himself with the distribution of British films, for which there is great scope in Persia, and if provided free these films would doubtless be extensively exhibited. III. Saudi Arabia Arabic broadcasts are already in existence, and written pro paganda could only be effected in Saudi Arabia with the consent and assistance of the King. In any case, it is not likely to be of great use in a country of illiterates, though if Ibn Sand were favourable British propaganda might be circulated among the popula tion of the towns. IV. I raq, (a) A matter of primary importance will be to suppress enemy propaganda in Iraq., especially if, as seems likely, the Palestine question remains a source of irritation. (b) For the purpose of controlling the press and establishing a censorship, His Majesty’s Embassy are of the opinion that a few pounds a week to about half a dozen newspapers would suffice. V. Egypt (a) A censorship scheme, which is now held in readiness by Military General Headquarters, provides for a War Press Bureau which, so far as the Arabic press is concerned, would work through the Egyptian Government Press Bureau. The War Press Bureau would have the double function of censoring press measures and of propa ganda, and would work in close contact with the Oriental Secretariat at the Embassy. VI. The Yemen (a) The Yemenis are much influenced by the foreign Arabic press (e.g. regarding Pa&amp;estine). If the press in Iraq, Egypt, etc. were bought or subsidised, it would therefore be much to our advantage as far as the Yemen is concerned.i ( V n. (b) Much good might be done by the printing of a first class Arabic nev/spaper (say in Egypt) for free circulation in Arabia, In ETTjw of the fact that previous papers of this type have been extremely dull apart from the actual nropaganda contained in them, it is suggested that it should contain: (i) sections on theology and religious matters. (ii) sections on sport, together v/ith photographs. It would then be assured of a wide circulation. ’’Bribe ry' of _officials_ or tribal chiefs . I. Turkey Sir P. Loraine makes no suggestions under this heading. II. Persia Mr. Seymour makes no suggestions. III. Sa udi Arabi a Sir R. Bullard suggests that it might be profitable to spend £25,000 or so on bribing important Government officials. IV. Iraq . Sir M. Peterson does not consider that the bribery of officials would produce any solid advantage, and he points out that the tribes will follow the lead of the Government. V. Egypt (a) The bribery of highly- laced officials may be considered as a measure which will not normally be necessary, and can be left aside until necessitated by circumstances. (b) This is not, however, the case with Palace officials, v/hose cooperation might be lukewarm and whose action escapes the ties which Anglo-Egyptian Treaty relations impose on the Egyptian Government. The amount of money necessary to bribe Palace officials v/ould depend on the competing corruption to be encountered at the time. (c) ...12 . (c) The bribing of tribal chiefs would be considered as part of the general question of the organisation of the desert Bedouins. (d) It is considered that existing funds, slightly increased, would be sufficient to buy the Egyptian press, provided that the nng1o-Sgyptian press censorship works effectively. VI. The Yemen (a) No direct bribes should be offered to highly placed officials, but pres ents might be given to the Imam and to officials on Moslem festivals and other such occasions. The cost of these presents is estimated at .£1,600 annually. (b) Assistance might be given to the important family of the Vazirs, who have already made overtures to the Aden Government. This assistance should probably take the form of arms and munitions rather than of money.. (c) The loyalty of Sheikh Mohammad Nurnan, who has influence with many of the Shafais, could be secured by the supply of arms and munitions and by a subsidy of £800 per annum.

Sir, High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, Jerusalem. 23rd October, 1935» I have the honour to inform you that, in connection with the present political situation, I have considered what reactions are likely to he felt in Trans-Jordan in the event of a European War, and what measures should he taken to prevent or minimise any local unrest in ouch circumstances. 2, I transmit herewith a copy of a memorandum prepared hy Major J.B. Glubb, O.B.E., M.C., on the subject, which has furnished a valuable basis for discussion of these questions. After consultation with the Air Officer Commanding and the Acting British Resident I have reached the following conclusionss- (i) that if it should become evident at any time that an outbreak of hostilities involving Great Britain was imminent, a sum of LP.10,000 should be made available to the British Resident for the subsidising of tribal sheikhs^ (ii) that all possible moral support should be given to His Highness the Amir, who should also be accorded, if necessary, financial assistance from the funds referred to in the preceding sub-paragraphs (iii) that on the actual outbreak of any hostilities in volving Great Britain, undesirable agitators in Trans-Jordan should be placed in enforced residence in Akaba, under the provision of the Trans-Jordan The Right Honourable Malcolm MacDonald, T.C., M.P., etc., etc., His Majesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.Prevention of Crime Law; and the one newspaper published in Trans-Jordan should be subsidised financially; (iv) that it is most unlikely that His Majesty’s Government would be willing in the contingency contemplated to make any statement, as suggested by Major Glubb, on the subject of their policy regarding the admission of Jews to Trans-Jordan; (v) that consideration should be given to the possibility of creating interference with broadcasts from hostile stations* Consideration has already been given to the similar problem arising out of Soviet broadcasts, which formed the subject of correspondence ending with the High Commissioner's despatch Confidential B of the 24th November, 1933, and I anticipate that it would be possible to arrange such interference through the Police wireless system; ( v ^) that the Officer Commanding, Arab Legion, should work out the details of a scheme to provide a light car patrol along the pipe-line of the Iraq Petroleum Company, in the event of an outbreak of hostilities involving Great Britain. Such a force would consist of about six cars, which could, if necessary, be hired locally, and approxirna te ly thir ty men. I have, etc. , (sgd. ) J. Ha THORN HaLL.

TP^ \S-JORDAN SECRET o Sir 5 I have the honour to refer to your secret despatch of the 23rd of Octoher 9 1935 5 regarding the measures which might he adopted in Trans-Jordan in the event of a European war. 2. Major Gluhh f s memorandum on this subject has been read v/ith interest and the conclusions reached by you have been noted. 3. After consultation with the Air Council^ I have the following comments to offer on the conclusions recorded in paragraph 2 of the despatch:- (i) and (ii)„ The advisability of being prepared to subsidize the tribal SheiKhs and possibly His Highness the Amir is recognised 9 but the funds to be made available for this purpose would depend upon the political situation existing at the time and the nature of the emergency to be met. (iii) In connection with the proposal to subsidize the one Trans-Jordan newspaper 5 it is noted that Article 4(i) (a) of the Trans-Jordan beience Law 5 1935, empowers His Highness the Amir to made regulations concerning the censorship, control and suppression of publications, writings, maps, plans, photographs, communications and means of communication. THE ACTING HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR TRANS-JORDAN—4— (iv) I'he question whether any statement should be made by His Majesty’s Government on the subject of their policy regarding the admission of Jews to Trans—Jordan, is one which would have to be decided in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time&lt;, (v) Attention is invited to my predecessor’s secret telegram No 0 529 of the 4th November, 1935, regarding the proposed ’’jamming” of the Italian broadcasts frcm Baric The general question of interfering with hostile broadcasts in w ar time is under consideration and a further communication will be addressed to you on the subject im i later date 0 (vi) It appears desirable that a detailed scheme for the protection of the pipeline in time of emergency should be preparedo It is assumed that this would be a subsidiary scheme framed under paragraph 31 on page 16 of Part I of the Defence Scheme,, It is, however, suggested that before the submission of proposals for incurring any expense on raising a special force, the possibility of ensuring the security of the pipeline by means of the proposed subsidies to the Sheikhs and the enforcement, with the assistance of the Air Forces in Trans-Jordan, of Tribal responsibility should be further explored,, I have, etco ? (Signed) J 0 H. THOMAS.•TKANS-JORDAN. SECRET . A. REFERENCE NO.TO/57/38. 9th August, 1938. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your secret Trans jordan despatch of the 4th July, 1938, on the subject of measure's to be taken in Trans-Jordan in time of war, and to inform you that only in two respects do I desire to qualify the conclusions recorded in Mr. Hall’s secret despatch of the 23rd October, 1935. 2. First, the sum of LP. 10,000 mentioned in paragraph 2(i) of Mr. Hall’s despatch as being required for the subsidising of tribal sheikhs would no doubt be sufficient in the first instance, but I do not doubt that it would need to be supplemented at intervals. In this connection I invite reference to paragraph 3 of Mr. Thomas’s secret despatch of the 18th March, 1936, in which it was stated, inter alia , that the funds to be made available for subsidies to Trans-Jordan tribes and possibly to His Highness the Amir, would depend upon the political situation existing at the time and the nature of the emergency to be met. In the event of such an emergency it would be essential to begin subsidising the tribes at once. Unless subsidies are paid from the very beginning of the emergency tribes may get out of hand and it would then be more dif ficult and more expensive to get them under control. The Right Honourable Malcolm MacDonald, P.C., M.P., His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.3. Second, as regards paragraph 2 (vi) of Mr. Hall’s despatch, the question of the formation of an Arab Legion mobile unit for the protection of the oil pipe line in Trans-Jordan has not yet been settled, and it will be remebered that Sir Arthur l/auchope, in his despatch secret ’A* of the 5th August, 1936, stated that the formation of this unit would be considered in con nection with the arrangements to be made under the Defence Scheme for the protection of the pipe line. I have again consulted the General Officer Commanding and the British Resident, Trans-Jordan, on this point and Sir Henry Cox recommends an immediate decision. General Raining, however, holds the view that in the light of present conditions the formation of a special local unit for the protection of the pipe line would be useless as a defensive measure unless it were closely related to the question of the force required to deal with the general situation likely to arise in Trans-Jordan in the event of war, of which general question the defence of the pipe line is only a small part. I agree with General Haining’s advice on this point and I propose to leave the question for consideration by the Military Authorities in connection with the general military measures for the control and defence of Trans jordan in time of war.

(Signed) F.B. WEBB. Richmond Terrace, S.W.1., 15th September, 193d.BRITISH EMBASSY, No. 378, ISTANBUL. (330/4/G/3S) , 28th July, 1938 My Lord, SECRET'. I have the ho of the despatch No, 287(E 87(E&lt;&gt; 3067/Gr) Secret of 2nd July, hy which Your* Lordship was so good as to ask for my views on the special measures which it might be desirable for His Majesty’s Government• to fake, in the event of the United Kingdom becoming involved in a war with a Great Power (specifically Italy), in order to influence Turkey in their favour, 2. In furnishing these views, I am to base myself on the present political situation, and on the present attitude of Turkey towards the United Kingdom, an attitude which is dictated by an ever—increasing conviction of the basic coincidence of Turkish mceresos with those of the United Kingdom and offers a gratifying prospect of durability c It may be confidently asserted that certain measures, which it would be open to His Majesty’s Government to take to influence Turkey in their favour in an emergency, have in fact already been taken, - and taken with notable successo The reports which I have had the honour to address to you and your The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G*, G.C.S.I,, G„C,I„E., etc., etc., etc.-2- support of this statement 0 4. I may nevertheless refer you more particularly to two, viz», the postscript of my despatch No. 100 of 16th February, paragraph 3; and the statement by Dr. Aras, related in my confidential letter to Mr. Eden of 24th February, 1937, that in the case of another war ’’Turkey would fight on the side of England”. I believe this statement to be both authoritative and binding; not merely because it was made by a responsible Turkish statesman, though even so not in any official form, but because it is the logical sequence of a policy of which I have been watching the steady and undeviating evolution during a period of four years. These measures on the part of His Majesty’s Government have been both general and particular - the pursuit of a world policy designed to promote peace, international security and the observance of international decencies with which Turkey, on grounds both of interest and inclination, has been very willing to associate herself; an understanding of the objectives and needs of the Turkish Republic; and assistance, lately intensified, to Turkey in the development of her economic and military strength. The British rearmament programme, I should add, has deeply impressed a realistic and practical—minded Turkey by its immense extent, by the energy with which it is being applied, by the volume of national support, and the willing acceptance of sacrifice, which it has evoked. I therefore believe that His Majesty’s Government may regard it as axiomatic that in a grave international emergency jeop ardizing the vital interests and naval power of theI £ United Kingdom and thenceforth imperilling the ideals and cohesion of the British Empire, Turkey would he ready, and indeed eager, to concert as closely as possible with His Majesty’s Government, with a view to defeat, by diplomatic or military co-operation, the designs and ambitions of The King’s enemies (please see again my confidential letter under reference). It is in terms of the scope of this axiomatic liaison and pro bable effective co-operation between the two countries that it is my purpose to reply to Your Lordship’s despatch. 5. That despatch mentions the possible value of Turkey’ s benevolent neutrality. Taking broad considera tions there are, in my view, circumstances in which such neutrality on Turkey’s part might well be of greater value to the United Kingdom than her armed co-operation. I offer the suggestion that it is desirable, as a matter of high political strategy, that Turkey’ s vis-k-vis a Great power war should be considered in conjunction with her membership - and in fact moral leadership - of the Balkan and Eastern Ententes, particular of the former, but not negligibly of the latter. One main aim of both those ententes is to keep a given territorial area clear of the devastation of a war which the respective parties realise quite well - a..1 none better than the Turks - may doom the existing world to extinction. Postulating, as I naturally do, the victory of British arms in the struggle under consideration, might it not be better that the United Kingdom, in the post-war period, - 3 -I ~ should find at least a certain area which had escaped the ravages of the contest, and would still offer economic possibilities in the succeeding period? Again, assuming a duel between Italy and the United Kingdom, is there not some risk that Turkey’s entry into the war on our side might bring into play some understanding implicit in the I tale'—German axis but of which we are unaware, and thus extend the scope of hostilities? We are aware (see again my confidential letter to Mx»c Eden of 24th Pebrua: y 5 19^) that if the United Kingdom were at war with Germany, Turkey vould wish to wait and see in which direction the Italian cat was jumping before throwing her military weight into the struggle. Is it not therefore possible that the converse might be equally true? 6. In any event, as I see the position, the period during which war is possible or imminent will inaugurate discussions between His Majesty’s .iovernment and the Turkish Government about the means of defending the interests and principles which they have in common, and it behoves us to ensure in advance that this liaison is as close and comprehensive as possible. To this end I consider, firstly, that His majesty’s Government should authorise their Ambassador here to discuss the situation, in its widest aspects with the Turkish Government for the purpose of ascertaining whether the two Governments can co-ordinate their diplomatic action vis-fe-vis the near and middle eastern states, andparticularly the /rah world*, Though the Arabs may look askance at Turkish policy at the moment, Turkey still possesses for them a considerable measure of prestige which, coupled with the influence of His Majesty’s Government, might prove decisive^ Secondly, Dr. Aras has admitted to me the necessity of something more than casual contact between the British and Turkish military authorities in a serious emergency. It is, in my view, desirable that in such circumstances whole-time service attaches should at once be attached to this Embassy, and that His Majesty’s Ambassador should be able to tell the Turks that these officers were at their disposal, under his guidance, to discuss any measures of co-operation which the two Governments might consider necessary or useful. Thirdly, an effort should be made, by whatever machinery seems most suitable, to ensure that the British and Turkish press speak with one voice. While I am opposed to any attempt to ’’buy” the Turkish press, I should see no objection to stating that if money were required to promote any form of publicity which the two Governments considered desirable in their mutual interests, His Majesty 1 s Government would be very willing to make a pro portionate contribution. 7, Whatever Turkey’s ultimate decision in the event of an outbreak of hostilities may be, a period of iurkish neutrality is more than a possibility. During any such period the liaison recommended above should be maintained and strengthened as far as possible, in an atmosphere of frankness and confidence. And I olfer for consideration the question whether it might not be exceedingly useful,-6— if, in the early stages of a war, when merchant shipjoing may he exposed to hostile action hy surface vessels, submarines and aircraft, and before His Majesty’s Navy had been able to bring to a general action and to destroy the enemy's main fleet and so to ensure the complete command of the seas, the Turkish Government were requested to agree, for their )art, to allow certain units of British mercantile shipping to be registered under the Turkish flag. 8. I turn now to the measures which might be sug gested to the Turkish Government in the event of their becoming co-belligerents with Kis Majesty's Government. In the political sphere, it might be intimated to them that, in the event of victory, His Majesty's Government would press for the demolition of the fortifications and military bases in the Dodecanese, and would be prepared to discuss, with both the Turkish and Greek Governments, the question of the ultimate ownership of the islands. In the military sphere Kis Majesty's Government should, I consider, be ready to afford, on request, protection to Turkish ports and coastwise communications in the Mediterranean. This, again, is a question to be dealt with through the system of military liaison on which I have already touched, as is also the question of the provision of arms and munitions for the prosecution of the war by Turkey. In the financial and economic spheres sereral possibilities suggest themselves, first that His Majesty's Goverunent should express readiness (on- 7 - the analogy of the support given to Greek currency after Greece’s entry into the war of 1914-18) to main tain during the period of hostilities the exchange value of Turkish currency (and to furnish credits to maintain its value after the close of hostilities), and secondly that they should intimate their willingness to examine every possibility of taking from Turkey such of her ex ports as might he deprived, by reason of hostilities, of their normal markets.. Thirdly His Majesty’s Government should announce that they v/ill consider sympathetically any requests from the Turkish Government for technical assistance (the elimination of the German teclinicians in this country is, ex hypothesi &gt; possible, and we should be in a position to replace them). Fourthly, the Turkish Government always regretted that in the Mosul settle ment they were unable to obtain any allotment of the Iraq oil shares. An offer to support, in the peace settlement, the transfer of a block of such shares to Turkey, more especially the Italian shares, if still owned by Italy, would undoubtedly have considerable attraction. 9. As a matter of tactics, I consider that we should endeavour rather to ascertain from the Turkish Government the measures of assistance which they desire, than seek to impose our assistance on them unasked. And if we, on our side, afford such assistance, I anti cipate that the Turkish Government will expect to furnish us with assistance in return, for reasons of national—3E? •&lt; -8— (v^) prestige if for no others.. In making this statement I have in mind the Turkish attitude towards the reciprocal guarantees for mutual assistance exchanged during the period of the Italo-Ahyssinian v/ar, an attitude which was recapitulated in paragraph 6 of my despatch No. 100 of February 16th. 10. The Fastern Department’s Secret letter No. S 3067/G of 5th July states that our military authorities have given consideration, inter alia , to the question of overland routes between the Persian Gulf and the Medit erranean and oil supplies. I ma,y mention, in this con nexion, that the Turkish Government are apprehensive as regards their oil supplies in war, and that it might be useful if we could offer to keep them supplied over the Iraq frontier, or elsehow. Moreover this route, assuming a junction to have been effected between the Iraq and Turkish railways, might, though clearly costly, be of use to His Majesty’s Government in the event of a temporary interruption of or embarrassing threat to our sea com munications in the Eastern Mediterranean. 11. In the preceding paragraphs I have tried, in response to Your Lordship’s request, to put forward a number of suggestions for definite action. Having done so I beg leave to draw your attention, with some earnest ness, to the psychological factors which, in my confident prediction, may well make or mar the success of the measures on which His Majesty’s Government may eventually rely to secure the co-operation, passive or active, of the Kemalist Republic.- 9 — 12# Reciprocity, and the handling of all dis cussions in a spirit of reciprocity, are essential; as much in respect of obligations as of benefits. Treat Turkey as an egual and you will get the Turkish best: and it is no mean best* Treat her as an inferior, and you will reap, sooner or later — but not I think until she has discharged her iDart of an accepted bargain - her lack of confidence and the alienation of her friend- shipr The Turk can be a very good ally: he is never likely to be a good catspaw* He has a pride of race, he is the heir of far from inglorious military traditions, and the consciousness of both things has grov/n visibly under the leadership of Ataturk. If he feels that his own ideas are receiving proper consideration at our hands, he will be receptive of our ideas. He much dislikes being overridden. 13. In military affairs he is willing to learn from masters; not from pupils. He has been steeped too long and too deeply in the German traditions of army organization, strategy and tactics to be able now to abandon them. On the sea and in the air he is willing to learn in the British school. I have, etc., (Signed) PERCY LORAINE.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT)• G R E T. M»E.

My Lord, Your Lordship’s secret despatch No. 833 (E 3067/G) of 2nd July arrived here at a time when many persons com petent to express opinions and who, in ordinary circum stances, would have been consulted on the measures necessary to dispose Egypt in our favour in the event of war, were either absent or about to depart on leave. 2. It would have been preferable to await their return before attempting to reply but, in view of the present trend of events in Europe, I have thought it best to collate, without further loss of time, a number of prelim inary observations, which can if necessary be amplified later, and these have been embodied in the enclosed memor andum which is the work of Mr. Sterndale Bennett in collaboration with Mr. Smart and the Commercial Secretary. A number of tentative suggestions by Mr. Gillan in relation to the Sudan have also been included. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief and the Air Officer Commanding have been furnished with copies of your despatch and their staffs are at present studying its implications. I propose to discuss the whole question with Sir Robert Gordon-Pinlayson and Air Vice-Marshal Nicholl on their return from Cyprus in the near future. 3. I am aware that in some respects the enclosed memor andum goes beyond the limits set out in Your Lordship’s The Right Honourable Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I •, GoCrI.S., etc., etc o, etc &lt;• -1-despatch, while in others it falls short of them* It endeavours inter alia to foresee the probable reactions of the Egyptians towards the Alliance in the possible event of initial enemy success at the beginning of war, and also touches on the steps which might be taken to restrict the activities of those who could be counted upon to work to our disadvantage in wartime« On the other hand, it does not enter into too great detail regard- what may, for convenience, be called the positive steps to be taken in the direction of ensuring continued Egyptian goodwill towards Great Britain j This has been done pur posely because Egypt, not being in the same position vis-a - vis of Great Britain as some of the other countries men tioned in Your Lordship’s despatch, calls for ad hoc treatment„ 4. One of the main recommendations in the memorandum is that, whatever else happens, every effort must be made in wartime to assist in the disposal of the cotton crop of Egypt and the Sudanc In view of the importance of cotton in the manufacture of munitions, this would presum ably be doubly to our advantage» If such assistance is not given the economic fabric of Egypt and the Sudan will crumble, and in Egypt the blame will be laid at the door of the Allianceo The number of those who contend that the Alliance favours Great Britain more than Egypt, and that it will make of Egypt a battlefield in our ouarrels, is likely to increase as the prospect of war becomes clearer: and it will cextainly not decrease if, in war, it is found that there is no way of disposing of Egypt's staple product*-3- 5o Important as this consideration is, it is not so serious as the preservation of internal order and the prevention of panic under the stress of modern war, as now indiscriminately practised on large citieso It may he true that air bombing in Spain and China has not unduly diminished the resistance of the populace, but it would probably not be true of the townsfolk in Cairo and Alexandria and of the people of the Delta, The danger has already been pointed out by Sir Miles Lampson (see paragraph 11 of His Excellency’s Most Secret despatch No, 1257 of 3rd November, 1937), and I would again emphasise it 0 The means of active defence against air raids are patently insufficient. Passive air defence is not yet organised and material is lacking. Added to this is the Egyptian tendency to mob hysteria. Severe aerial bombardments of Cairo and Alexandria would probably produce uncontrollable panic, which might completely disorganise the communications of the British Forces operating in the Western Desert and virtually create another British front by adding the control of the Delta population to the task of the General Officer Commanding-in~Chief. To meet this possibility, it is clearly essential that the measures for the aerial defence - passive and active - of the two cities should be completed with the utmost dispatch, 6. Last, but not least, there is Palestine, This question is beyond my province. It is sufficientto state that so long as some solution (not necessarily ideal or permanent) not unfavourable to the Arabs remains undiscovered, we are running the gauntlet of Egyptian sentiment both secular and religious, with consequences that can hardly be foreseen - especially if war . omes in the near futureo I am, etc-c, (S i gued) C, H, BATEMAN.—5- Memop ajiduni on PQ s i^lg War Meas ures in En.TPt , Lroadly speaking, the problem set in Fopeirjn Office secrec despatcn No 0 855 of July 2nd is how to ensure the maximum degree of E^ptian co-operation with us in the event of a war between the United Kingdom, on the one hand, and on the other, Italy or a combination of Italy, Germany and Japan e In considering chis problem it would be best to proceed on the assurap tion that Italy, safeguarded in Europe, either actively or passively by Germany, would be in a position to strike a blow against us in Egypt, and that Egypt would in fact be an actual theatre of war 0 start off in Egypt with the advantage of a Treaty of Alliance under which, on the 'ernption that we have done everything possible to settle by peaceful means the dispute leaning oo war, Egypt is bound to participate as our ally and to give us all possible assistance, including the use of ports, aerodromes and means of communication (Article ? of the irea by) 0 v¥e have the additional a dvantage of having troops stationed in Egypt and a British Military Mission which should be able to ensure effective control over the activities of the Egyptian Army prior to and after the outbreak of war 0 Further more, there is a natural reason why Egypt might n ' vcr.lly be expected to fulfil her obligations to us in a war with Italy* Having seen the Italian expansion in Libya and the conquest of Abyssinia, Egyptians are apprehensive of Italian designs on Egypo and have no wish to come under Italian domination,, 3&lt;&gt; ihere are nevertneless certain factors which might militate againsi their wholehearted co-operation with us 0 There is a feeling among a section of Egyptian public opinion that the Alliance is dangerous to Egypt in that it tends to- 6 - embroil them in quarrels which are not theirs 0 Experience since the signing of the Treaty has not been such as to re-assure us regarding Egypt being 100% forthcoming in an emergency, and the Italians may be expected to do everything possible by propaganda to disclaim territorial designs and to convince Egypt that she has nothing to fear from Italy,, Furthermore, a growing realisation of the damage which Italy could do by air bombardment from Libya may, as time goes on, have its effects 4 0 It is possible, therefore, that Egypt would try to sit on the fence or that her co-operation with us would be at the best lukewarmo There are three other factors which must be taken into accountc In the first place if there were any doubt in the minds of the Egyptians as to whether we were likely to be the winning side there would be a natural tendency to ’’trim” in the hope of getting favourable terms eventually from the Italianso Secondly, although the Italians might on political grounds refrain at first from bombing anything but purely military objectives, v/e must count on Italian air raids even tually producing ouch a degree of panic and chaos as virtually to paralyse Egyptian co-operation. Thirdly, there is the attitude of neighbouring countries to consider, 5. It is unfortunately doubtful v/hether the British Forces normally stationed in Egypt will be strong enough or sufficient ly equipped for the task which will fall upon them at the out break of war. An initial success by the Italians in the Western Desert, accompanied by aerial bombardment of the cities of the Delta, could not fail to shake the Egyptians, and if, to the virtual closing of the Mediterranean, which must be accepted as practically inevitable at the outset, were added the closure of the Red Sea through the Italian domination of the Bab el Mandeb, our chances would not look very promising- 7 - ■I ■—■ in Egyptian eyes, which would naturally he riveted on immediate local factors rather than on the more remote and wider ones which would make themselves decisively felt as the war went on. 6. The most effective way of ensuring Egyptian support would undoubtedly be an immediate and convincing display of force when war was imminent or on its outbreak, designed to remove any doubt as to our ability to defend Egypt. This would presumably be less difficult to arrange as regards the Navy and the Air Force than as regards the Army, which might be dependent on reinforcements from India and further East. It would be of the first importance also to deal speedily with the Italian position at the southern end of the P.ed Sea. In the meantime it seems wise to pay particular attention to the provision of active anti-aircraft defence in Egypt and to do everything possible to speed up Egyptian anti-aircraft precautionso 7. It remains to consider the attitude of neighbouring countries. The Foreign Office despatch suggests that develop ments in Palestine should be ruled out from the present survey. But, in this respect, our policy in Palestine is of capital importance. The Italians and the Germans will certainly exploit it to the full. The danger of the creation of a hostile Arab bloc has already been frequently represented. Egypt cannot remain indifferent to the attitude of her Arab neighbours; indeed her active interest in the Palestine problem is steadily increasing. It seems essential, therefore, to reach at all events a temporary solution of the Palestine problem, acceptable to the Arabs, if, as is indicated by the Foreign Office, it is ‘ essential to secure any considerable co-operation from the Arab countries and Egypt. II. Qc So far this memorandum has dealt with considerations cf a general order affecting the probable attitude of Egypt.Assuming her co-operation as an ally, it remains to consider the particular measures which would he advisable in order to ensure her maximum effectiveness in the actual prosecy, .ion of the war. 9. The extent of these measures will depend on the vitality which we may have been able to infuse into the Alliance by cur policy prior to an outbreak of war # The following paragraphs are purely tentative and designed to suggest the lines of further detailed enquiry. 10. The Eastern Department of the Foreign Offi .*&gt;, in their letter of 2nd July, have suggested various measures already mentioned in the discussion of this question in London in relation to Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Transjordan and the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. It may be convenient to determine first how far they are applicable to the case of Egypt e S ub sidies to .the Government. 11. In the case of Egypt these would presumably take the indirect form of credits for such purposes as:- (i) 'Dhe purchase of any arms and munitions v/hich His Majesty ? s Government might not be able themselves to supply. (ii) the financing of Egyptian cotton crops. (iii) the support of Egyptian currency. The consequences of the war upon the Egyptian budget and currency might profitably be discussed with Sir Frank Watson and Sir Edward Cook on their return from leave. Bribes to h ighly-placed offic ials . 12. These need not be considered as a measure likely to be normally necessary, and can be left aside until and unless shown to be necessitated by circumstances. An exception would be the case of Palace officials, whose co-operation might be lukewarm and whose action escapes the control which Anglo- Egyptian Treaty relations impose on the Egyptian Government. It might become necessary to bribe one or more of them, butM3 the necessity or opportuneness of this cannot 'be decided now. The personnel or influence of its members is liable to vary. At the present moment it would be advisable, for instance, to buy Mourad Mohsin Pasha, the Head of the Royal Khassa. Two to three thousand pounds would probably keep him well-disposed during the first year of the war. But the amount would depend on the competing corruption to be countered at the time. The H buying u of tribal or other elements. 13. This should be considered as part of the general question of the organisation of the desert Bedouin, to which further reference is made below. It will no doubt be desirable to subsidize certain men of influence in the tribes, and it is proposed to ask the British Military Liaison Officer in the Western Desert to indicate the persons to whom payments should be made and the manner in which this should be done. The 'buying” of the press. 14. It is the view of the Oriental Secretary that existing funds, slightly increased, would probably be sufficient for this purpose, provided the Anglo-Egyptian Press Censorship works effectively. Intensification of propaganda. 15. No censorship scheme has yet been worked out with the Egyptian Government under Article 7 of the Treaty, but the censorship scheme which Headquarters, British Troops in Egypt meanwhile hold in readiness for production to the Egyptian Government in case of need provides for a war press bureau which, so far as the Arabic Press is concerned, would work through the Egyptian Government Press Bureau. It is understood that the war press bureau would have the double function of censoring (or assisting the Egyptians to censor) press messages and of propaganda. Its organisation is about to be discussed with Headquarters, British Troops in Egypt. It would have to work in close contact with the Oriental Secretariat of the Embassy,w and in fact the intention is to amalgamate the existing press services of the Embassy and of Headquarters, British Troops in Egypt* It may be necessary to detach some member of the Oriental Secretariat to act as political adviser to the press bureau, and it has been suggested that Mr. Hamilton might be earmarked for this purpose. Economic assistance. 16. For some time past a British Resources Committee, presided over by the Commercial Counsellor to the Embassy and consisting of members of the Embassy, Headquarters, British Troops in Egypt, Headquarters, Royal Air Force, Middle East, and the Naval Liaison Officer, have been collecting, in anti cipation of the ultimate formation of a joint Anglo-Egyptian Resources Board, particulars of available suppliesof various commodities in relation to the probable requirements of the British military forces; and it appears from their work so far that Egypt would be, generally speaking, self-supporting in essential food supplies (e.g. wheat, barley, sugar, meat, rice, fruit, vegetables, milk and butter). 17. The main problem in time of war is likely to be the transporter Egypt’s sea-borne exports and imports, and in particular the disposal of Egyptian cotton. If the Mediterranean and/or the Red Sea remain open, the rationing of shipping for this purpose may be necessary. If, on the other hand, the sea routes through the Mediterranean and Red Seas were closed for any considerable time, and a lena route through the Sudan to Mombasa proves (as seems likely) impossible to establish, except perhaps for the movement of small quantities of merchandise, then His Majesty's Government may have to take steps to purchase Egyptian cotton at a good price and store it for future disposal. In fact, an announcement at the outset of hostilities that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to purchase the entire Egyptian cotton crop at ruling Liverpool prices would probably be the most effective economic -10--11- step that could be ta^en to identify Egyptian interests with our own. 18. A breakdown of Egypt’s domestic economy would produce a reaction of definite ill-will and even hostility towards us. Despatch of suitable officials as political or military advisers. 19. Faced by the danger of war a relatively well-disposed Government and people would no doubt be only too ready to acquiesce in our taking the lead and to follow our advice. It is important that, in such circumstances, we should avoid any undue appearance of wishing to assume actual control, except in the case of certain key military posts. Virtual control may be thrust upon us in other spheres, but the willing co-operation of the Egyptians will probably be obtained most effectively by an appearance of trust and of leaving responsibility with them. 20. A certain number of advisers and liaison officers may nevertheless be required, either with the Egyptian military forces or in the V/estern Desert in connexion with the organisa tion of the Bedouin, or in the civil administration, and especially the Police, who may find the task of controlling the civilian population under conditions of aerial warfare a par ticularly difficult one. 21. It is necessary also to contemplate a situation in which, with an ill-disposed Government and people, we might be com pelled to take over the actual control of administreition to the extent required by our military position and communications. 22. Headquarters, British Troops in Egypt, and Headquarters, Royal Air Force, Middle East will no doubt be able to supply the names of officers and ex-officers particularly qualified for liaison work, and the Secretary of the Association of British Officials of the Egyptian Government will be asked to keep a similar confidential list of suitable British officials who have served or are still serving with the Egyptian Govern ment. Meanwhile, a list is being prepared in the Embassy of(rw the most suitable retired British members of the Egyptian Government, who might in the event of war be asked to return to take up posts in Egypt, Free provision of arms and ammunition. This v/ill be discussed with Headquarters, British Troops in Egypt and the Military Mission. But it does not seem par ticularly applicable to Egypt. Every effort is at present being made to supply the needs of the Egyptian Government con sistently v/ith our own rearmament programme, and, in war, Egypt would presumably continue to be supplied with British arms. Whether the supply should be free could only be decided in the light of circumstances. 24. In addition to the above measures it might be necessary to consider suitable steps:(l) to influence the King and the Palace generally. In this connexion bribery has been dealt with in paragraph 12. The King might have to bo given incon venient assurances of our* support to maintain him on the Throne if he co-operated whole-heartedly with us. (2) To counter enemy activities. Plans already exist to forestall attempts at sabotage by tne large Italian community in Egypt (estimated at some 54,000 persons). These plans could easily be applied to Germans also, though the German community is comparatively small and scarcely likely to engage in sabotage on the same scale as the Italians. In the event of hostilities involving Italy but not Germany, the German community might nevertheless need careful watching, as they might conceivably act in various commercial and other matters os Italian agents. The Commercial Secretary has already drawn up lists of the principal firms in Egypt under German or Italian ownership or control, or having close commercial relations with Germany or Italy. (3) To provide extra medical assistance. The investigations of the British Resources Committee referred to above have shown that there is likely to be a serious shortage not only of hospital -12--13- accommodation for civilian air raid casualties but also of medical supplieso IIIo 25 0 Tde enquiry in Foreign Office despatch No. 833 extends also to the Sudan and was tentatively discussed with Mr. Gillan, the Civil Secretary to the Sudan Government, during his recent passage through Alexandria on leave. Mr. Gillan was reluctant to express definite views without prior consultation with the Governor-General, hut the following is a summary of his tentative and purely personal views. 26c, The attitude of 90^ of the Sudanese will depend on general contentment with the administration. This may he assumed at the commencement of hostilities and prohahly for another year or so* The attitude of most of the remaining 10^ (the intelligentsia) will also he pro-government, though if things went badly it might waver sooner than that of the mass* The above-mentioned minority of 10$ (a potentially troublesome one in relation to its size) would be largely influenced by the Egyptian attitude. 27. Sudan revenue and the prosperity of the people depend primarily on cotton, and to some extent on gum, hides, etc. To keep the people in heart (and the Government in funds) it would be necessary to find a market for Sudanese cotton. The effect of war upon the cotton market is difficult to forecast but His Majesty’s Government may have to come in, by direct purchase or otherwise, to ensure the sale of the cotton crop and possibly of gum, etc. 28. Of imports the first contraction that the people would feel would be sugar. To remain contented they must have plentiful and cheap sugar. This might require planning and subsidy. 29. The Sudan press presents no real difficulty in control, whether by propaganda, bribery or suppression. Its real-14- ( M) influence is very limited. It would 'be necessary to watch the attitude of the Egyptian press* 30. Any release (except in a very few individual cases) of British personnel to join His Majesty ! s Forces would he very shortsighted. It would probably be necessary to assume some form of control over the personnel of Sudan Plantations. Cotton would be, so to speak, a national service. IV o 31. Although perhaps not strictly relevant to the Foreign Office enquiry, which relates to measures necessary to ensure the maximum willing Egyptian co-operation, it may be useful to refer to certain lines of action which are already being followed (apart from specific defence plans) with a view to preparedness for war. Passive air defence. The interest of the Prime Minister in civilian anti-air raid precautions has been stimulated by His Majesty’s Embassy to the extent that he lias set up a central Egyptian committee in Cairo, to report on the adequacy of the existing organisation, and two sub-committees - one in Cairo and one in Alexandria - to work out schemes for the respective cities. A certain amount of paper organisation exists, but gasmasks and other essential equipment are almost entirely lacking. The Embassy are doing their best to bring the Egyptian Government to the point of asking for a Home Office expert to come to Egypt to advise and co-ordinate. Organisa tion ofthe Bedouin. Colonel Hatton, late executive Commander of the Frontier Administration Forces and now a member of the Military Mission, has drawn up a scheme for tho formation of an Arab territorial force, with senior officers drav/n from the Egyptian army and junior officers from among theA robs thems e Ives The General Officer Conmanding-in-Chief has recommended to the Chief of the Military Mission that this he brought into force on a small scale hi the first instance in the Siwa District, and gradually extended if successful. The whole question is to he further considered between the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief and the Chief of the Military Mission on the latter’s return from leave. It will no doubt be necessary to attach qualified British officers to the Egyptian commanders in order to give the Bedouin the necessary confidence and to ensure effective desert control. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief and the Military Mission will be asked to have ready a list of suitable candidates for this task. Resources. As already recorded In this memorandum, a British committee has been going into the question of existing resources in Egypt (food supplies, transport, engineering and medical stores ? and oil) in relation to the war requirements of the British and Egyptian Forces and the civilian population, A great deal of information has been collected, and the Egyptian liaison officials appointed for the purpose by the Prime Minister are conducting supplementary enquiries. It remains to discuss with the Egyptians the question of distribution and rationing, and it will be necessary to consider some form of price control, 32. Other questions winch appear to require consideration are: - (a) Stock Exchange control, (b) the control of shipping, (c) the internment of enemy nationals, vessels and aircraft, and the confiscation and custody of enemy property and businesses.Anx suixUuiCG from London on the manner in which these things should he organised would he welcome,, No doubt they are already provided for In Great Britain and we should get instructions In duo course 1' war broke outo But events move more speedily now than in 1914, and it would be well to be prepared in advance 0 (Sgdo) Jo Co STERNDALE BENNET 27th August , 1933c —^ ' -•*—»i MO rum-rm(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT.)

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your secret despatch of the 4th July, 1938, regarding the special measures, if any, that it would he desirable for His Majesty’s Government to take on the outbreak of war involving the United Kingdom in order to influence the Yemen in favour of Great Britain. 2. I have discussed this question with Lieut.-Colonel M.C. Lake, Political Secretary, and with Captain B.W. Seager, the Frontier Officer, whose duties have brought him into close personal contact with the King of the Yemen and with the leading personalities in that country. At my request, Captain Seager has written a Memorandum dealing particularly with the measures mentioned in the second paragraph of Mr. Baxter’s secret semi-official letter of the 3rd June to Sir Reader Bullard, a copy of which was enclosed with your despatch. I enclose a copy of this Memorandum, with which I am in complete agreement. 3. The present King of the Yemen is politically a very hard bargainer, but he has the reputation of keeping his word when he has once given it. Having signed a Treaty of Friendship with His Majesty’s Government, he would not, in my opinion, lightly break The Right Honourable Malcolm MacDonald, M.P., H.M.’s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, London.■■■■I ft it; but this may not be true of all his advisers or his successor. In existing circumstances, I think that the King's main object in the case of, say, an Anglo-Italian war, would bo to maintain his neutrality and, as far as possible, to observe his treaty obligations to both powers. Circumstances may, however, prove too strong for him, and it must be remembered that measures such as are now under contem plation for influencing the Yemen in time of war have already for many years been adopted by the Italian Government in time of peace. Anglo-Yemeni relations have, moreover, been strained by the recent frontier dispute and by the situation in Palestine. fhere is, therefore, a good deal of lee-way to make up, and, if His Majesty's Government were prepared to consider such a suggestion, it would be of great benefit if some of the measures now proposed could be adopted at once without waiting for the outbreak of a war. 4. The most potent factor affecting the policy of the Yemen in the event of war will be that which influences most weak neutrals, namely the question as to which of its powerful neighbours is likely to be the victor. The most effective measure lor securing the assistance or benevolent neutrality of the Yemen would, therefore, be the maintenance Ox Brition forces in or near the Red Sea adequate to prevent the intrusion of any other European Power into southern Arabia. If this could be done all other measures would be of secondary importance. I have, etc., (Signed) B.R. REILLY. Governoro -2*I have the following observations to make on the form of questionnaire at the end of the Secretary of State’s secret despatch of 4th July last, 2,. Reference (a) . No observations. r Reference (b) . It is advisable not to give straight bribes to highly placed officials but presents to the Imam and senior Yemeni officials on Moslem festivals etc. This would be by no means an out-of-the-way move because such presents would be greatly appreciated while it would create an expectant and friendly atmosphere. The value of the presents should not exceed a sum of £1,600 annually. Reference (c). (1) The Wazirs (who are at present the most influential family in the Yemen after that of the Imam’s) have been making overtures to the Aden Govern ment in the past 3 years for some assurances that we would assist them in time of need: and that to date we have been careful enough to make no such assurances nor have we given them an opening to put forward their proposals. In the event of hostilities the VVazirs might well be of the greatest use to us as they are Zeidis (the present Ruling Class) governing Shafais who form the greater part of the Yemeni population (and the Shafais are much discontented with Zeidi rule. If the Wazirs were to be informed that our support would be forthcoming in the event of hostilities this would no doubt make them friendly disposed. It would probably not be a matter of subsidising the family but they v might require promises of supplies of arms and ammuni tion in abundance and at the given moment. One can onlyhazard a guesc as to their reactions.. (2) The Shafais (particularly those who live in the area from Sheikh Said, opposite perim, to a point on the Ta* iz -Aden road N.N»VV, of Aden) are under the influence of the Nu T man Parnily (once the paramount authority in the area described). Sheikh Muhammad Nu' man, the Acting Head of the family, only a week, ago told me that uhe ohafais would side with us at the word- Sheikh Muhammad who happens to 'be a good iriend o.l mine, is worth cultivating as he cGuid get at uho o -nor Shafais in the Yemen* Promises of arms^aud uion and a subsidy of £800 a year to Sheikh Muliammad would guarantee the overwhelming support o^- ^he ohafais provided they were not overrun by enemy troops « dav or tv/o after the outbreak ox hostilities.

This information is required to enable the competent Departments of His Majesty^ Government to prepare, with the assistance of similar reports from other British Representatives in the Middle East, a comprehensive plan showing the measures which might be taken to influence countries such as Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Persia, Transjordan, and the various States of Arabia, whose assistance, or even benevolent neutrality, might be of substantial value to the United Kingdom in ti e of war. 3. It is evident that, in the case of Saudi Arabia, any suggestions or recommendations which you may wish to put forward must be based on the assumption that the outbreak of the supposed war will find the Government of King Ibn Saud still in power. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for you to submit recommendations which would be applicable to the different circumstances of a different regime. Similarly, it would be difficult for jaou to attempt to take into account the full effects of any changes which might later take place in the political situation. I recognise, Sir R.W. Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., etc., etc., etc., British Legation, Jedda. -2-in particular, that developments in Palestine, and the action eventually taken as the result of the Technical Commissions 1 s report, mny profoundly change the whole situation, either for the 'better, if the action taken in Palestine is acceptable to King Ibn baud, or is at least such as he may feel able to regard with resignation, or for the worse, if the action taken in Palestine is unacceptable, and leads to increased hostility on the part of the Arab Governments and peoples* It will therefore be sufficient for you to base your report largely on the existing situation, not only regarding the continuance in power of King Ibn 3aud and his Government, but also as regards the continuance of his present general attitude towards His Majesty*s Government. 4. You may also assume, for the sake of simplifying your report, that the supposed war is a war between the United Kingdom on the one hand and Italy, with or without Germany and Japan as her allies, on the other. 5. The financial and economic resources of the United Kingdom are far greater than those of its potential enemies, and the object of the study which is being accorded to this problem is primarily to prepare plans showing how this advantage could be exploited to the utmost upon the outbreak of war. The existence of such plans, even though they may require modification as the result of subsequent developments in the political situation, will, it is hoped, be of great value in enabling a fully considered policy to be put into effect without delay in an emergency. 6.

My dear Bullard, We are sending you by to-day’s bag an official despatch calling for a report on the measures which might be taken in Saudi Arabia on the outbreak of a war between the United Kingdom and Italy. The origin of this request was a report by our military authorities which dealt with the whole strategic situation in the Middle East, including such matters as the overland routes between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean, oil supplies, air routes, the position at Aden, and so forth. One of their recommendations was that the Departments concerned should investigate and report on the measures v/hich might be taken, either before or on the outbreak of war, to influence those minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance, or even benevolent neutrality, might be of value to us in time of war. We have not given you in our official despatch any indication what measures we have in mind. We certainly do not wish to limit the scope of your recommendations in any way. But it may perhaps help you if I now mention one or two of the measures which have been mentioned here; some of them, of course, are not applicable to Saudi Arabia, but were thought of in connexion with the very different circumstances prevailing in (for example) Turkey, or Transjordan, or one of the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf area. Such measures are (a) subsidies to the Government, (b) bribes to highly placed officials, Sir R. W. Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., British Legation, Jedda.(c) attempts to tribal or other elements, (d) attempts to 'buy' the press, (e) intensification of propaganda, (f) economic assistance, (g) despatch of suitable officials as political or military advisers in time of war* (h) free provision of arms and ammunition etc* for the expansion of forces for local defence or for participation as allies of the United Kingdom. I hope that these suggestions will be of some use to you in preparing your report, which will, I am sure, be of great value to us in drawing up our more comprehensive plans for the whole Middle Eastern area. It will, of course, make your report more valuable still if you can give some idea of the scale and cost of any measures you may recommend* (Signed) C.W.

INDIA OFFICE The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax,ENCLOSURE IN BAGHDAD DESPATCH NO. 329 OP 18/7/38. Rerw^rt on the Special Measures which it woula be desirable for His Majesty's Government to take, on the outbreak of war between Great Britain and, one or rnorG of* the Great Powers^ in order to influence Iraq in favour of Urg.^b Britain. 1. In accordance with instructions, it is assumed in this report that the war is between the United Kingdom and Italy and that the situation in Iraq, is in general similar to that which exists at the present time. It should, however, be borne in mind that unless war breaks out very soon, the situation in Iraq at its outbreak will be fundamen tally different from what it is now. The question of the future of Palestine is soon to be settled finally and the form of settlement will profoundly influence the situation in Iraq. If it is acceptable to the Arabs, it will be far easier to win over Iraq to our cause in the event of war; if not, the hostility towards us which will follow will make this purpose difficult to achieve. In either event the situation will be essentially different from the state of suspense and uncertainty which now obtains in Anglo-Arab relations, and an appreciation of the problem under consideration, which is based on the idea of things in this country remaining as they are, is therefore to a great extent artificial. In view of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance concluded in 1930, the position of His Majesty’s Government vis-a-vis Iraq in the event of Great Britain becoming involved in war with a Great Power would be very different from their position vis-a-vis other countries in the Middle East, such as Turkey or Persia.Article 4 of that Treaty provides that in the event of Great Britain becoming engaged in war, Iraq will immedi ately come to her aid in the capacity of an ally and that this aid shall consist in furnishing to Kis Majesty’s Government on Iraqi territory all facilities and assistance, including the use of railways, rivers, ports, aerodromes and means of communication* This definition of Iraq’s obligations is comprehensive and it would seem that, provided that these obligations were fully met, His Majesty’s Government would, at all events at the beginning of the war, have small need to ask for more. 3. It must be borne in mind, however, that Iraq might be very reluctant to be drawn into a British quarrel with one or other of the Great Powers. It would probably seem to the Iraqi Government that they would have little to gain from such a struggle, that the country would be exposed to serious risks while it was in progress and that Iraq would be in danger of dismemberment and extinction if Great Britain were defeated in the end. It must therefore be foreseen that the Iraqi Government might in such circumstances endeavour to preserve their neutrality and to evaae their treaty obliga tions. Some of the means which they might employ to this end are outlined below: (l) They might find grounds to argue that the provisions of Article 3 of the Treaty (as interpreted by the assurance given in the High Commissioner’s letter to the Iraqi Prime Minister, No. 256 of 7th November, 1930 - see Bagdad despatch Secret ’A’ of 11th November, 1930, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies), coupled with those of the second“4— paragraph of Article 1, had not been fully observed. That is to say, they might contend that there had • not been full and frank consultation with them before war was declared and that, in consequence, Article 4 was not binding. (2) They might maintain that they were called upon to give the aid specified in Article 4 in circumstances which prejudiced their rights and obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty for the Renunciation of War signed at Paris in 1928 (Article 9 of the Treaty) and that therefore this aid could not be given. (3) They might take the line that it would be suicidal for them to act in accordance with Article 4 as by so doing they would expose themselves to immediate enemy action of a kind which would be disastrous to the Iraqi State. 4. It must also be expected that enemy diplomacy will be exerted to persuade the Iraqi Government to follow one or more of the above courses. Assurances will be offered that Iraqi interests will be respected if Iraq remains neutral, but no room for doubt will be left that Iraq will be attacked with all the resources of the Great Power hostile to Great Britain if she is true to her bond as Great Britain’s ally. 5. The first need therefore will be to deny to Iraq the opportunity to wriggle out of the alliance and by overcoming her fears or exciting her cupidity to persuade her whole heartedly to implement Article 4 of the Treaty of 1930. Seme steps which might be taken with this object in vieware outlined below: (1) Pull consultation with the Iraqi Government concerning any situation which is likely to lead to a rupture with one or other of the Great Powers. (2) Careful arrangements at Geneva to ensure that war does not occur in circumstances which could be held by Iraq to contravene the Covenant of the League or the Pact of Paris. For example, the Iraqi delegate should, if possible, be brought to vote for a resolution or some other act of the Council or Assembly v/hich would put Great Britain in the right. (3) Convincing preparations to show that Great Britain will fully protect Iraq from attack (especially by air) and will safeguard her essential economic interests, e.g. her exports of oil and raw materials. If it could not be demonstrated that Iraq’s sea borne trade would be effectively protected, compensation for established losses might have to be offered. For example, a payment of money equal to any loss in oil royalties directly attributable to the war. 6. These measures in themselves might not be enough to secure the desired end, and in that event, one or more of the following means of persuasion might be usefully employed: (1) An undertaking that in the event of Great Britain being victorious, His Majesty’s Government would assist Iraq politically and financially to carry4 h L w A Opuax djuK.

(2) A renewal of the undertaking regarding the incidence of expenditure under Article 4 of the Treaty given in the high Commissioner^ letter to the Iraqi Prime Minister, No. 157 of 23rd November # 1931 (see Colonial Office Secret despatch to Sir Francis Humphrys of 13th November, 1931). (3) The cancellation of outstanding instalments due to His Majesty’s Government for the Port of Basra. (Cost about £270,000). (4) An offer to bear the whole or part of the interest and sinking fund of the Iraqi State Loan of 1937. (Cost: £95,000 a year for about 15 years). (5) An offer of a new loan on very easy terms to enable Iraq to meet war expenditure. (Cost: Say £1,000,000 at 2i%). (6) An offer to arrange at the end of the war with a British firm for the construction on very favourable terms of one or more of Iraq’s essential major irrigation works (i.e. Habbaniya Escape). (Cost: Estimated cost of this project is £400,000). (?) An offer to furnish Iraq, free of charge, with the necessary artillery and small arms, ammunition and other military equipment to enable her forces to carry out the work which v/ould devolve upon them under Article 4 of the Treaty of Alliance. Anti-aircraft equipment would be required if future aerial developments were to bring Baghdad -6—&gt; * within the effective ran&amp;'e of the Italian air- 'bases in Libya* (Cost: Difficult to estimate) 0 (8) An assurance that the use 'by His Majesty’s Government of the facilities to which they are entitled under Article 4 of the Treaty would in no way prejudice Iraq’s complete independence as a sovereign State, 7. The principle underlying these suggestions is that it should he demonstrated to the Iraqi Government that it will he hoth safe and profitable to he on the side of Great Britain* 8. It is not thought that attempts to bribe individual Cabinet Ministers or other influential personages would bring any solid advantage* As regards the tribes, little trouble need be expected so long as the Government them selves are on the right side* 9. Ho attempt of Italy to pose as the natural protector of Moslem States would be taken seriously in Iraq* 10* Cnee the Iraqi Government have been won over to wholehearted co-operation, it would be necessary to take measures to protect the country from the contamination of enemy influence. For this purpose it would be desirable to endeavour to persuade the Iraqi Government to: (a) Increase the strength of the Military Mission,, (Cost: Five officers: about £10,000 a year)* (b) To increase the British advisory staff in the Ministry of the Interior and to appoint British * Administrative Inspectors to the chief provincial centres, (Cost: Five officials: £10,000 a year), (c) To suppress enemy propaganda and arrest enemy agents. -7“*(d) To control the press and establish a censorship, (Cost: A few pounds a v/eek to about half-a-dozen papers should be enough)* (e) To stop trading with the hostile Power-, Sach one of these measures (except (d)) would be expensive and the readiness of the Iraqi Government to adopt them would vary in ratio with the willingness of His Majesty^ Government to bear part of the cost.4' 1' Ho. 305 British Legation, (601/3/38) Tehran. SBC R L T. ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY ^ ust ' 1938 No. 1 3 3 OMAR 1539 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND No. 1 3 My Lord » inw.y&gt; mix .■lull I imy■ I I ■!-—»H' ■■ SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE In your Lordship’s despatch No* 220 of the 2nd July, (E.3067.G.), you instructed me to report on any measures which His Majesty’s Government might take, on the outbreak of a war between the United Kingdom and Italy, to influence Iran in favour of the United Kingdom. 2. I think that it may be taken for granted that in an eventuality of this kind, Iran will at first make every effort to remain completely neutral. This attitude I should expect to be maintained at any rate in the initial stages of the conflict, but might well be changed if the progress of the war seemed to offer a safe opportunity for Iran to take what she wants in the Persian Gulf. Practical assistance is not to be hoped for from Iran; the efforts of His Majesty’s Government would be most usefully directed if concentrated on maintaining in Iran this attitude of complete neutrality, which in practice would no doubt to a great extent mean attempting to counteract Italian efforts to influence Iran against the United Kingdom. The most useful approach to the question set by Your Lordship may therefore be to enumerate some of the measures which might be taken by Italy, suggesting in each case the steps which might be taken by His Majesty’s Government, preferably in advance, to counteract the Italian measures. The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., etc*, etc., etc., The Foreign Office.*-2- 3* The Italians might v/ell endeavour, hy means of intensive propaganda in Afghanistan, directed from Tehran, to raise the North-West Frontier tribes against the Army in India, and generally to influence the Afghans against British interests. They would further, no doubt, encourage the Iranian Government to hamper the production of oil from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company oilfields, if not actually to seize them. (The Italians would no doubt encourage acts of sabotage in the oil refineries and on the pipe-lines; this, however, is a matter for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to deal with, and it would he difficult for His Majesty's Government to assist.) Efforts in these directions would have to he checked hy counter-pressure on the Iranian Government and in this connection economic assistance hy His Majesty’s Government, prohahly in the form of the provision of railway material and, if possible, aircraft would suggest itself as the best means of keeping the Iranian Government impartial. I think the offer of such assistance, if it could he made in the early stages of a war, would he of great practical benefit. It would he the more important if Germany, from which country Iran now draws so much machinery, etc., were also involved. 4. Intensive efforts to turn Persian opinion against the United Kingdom would doubtless he made by the Italians, not only hy means of propaganda hy radio from Italy and Libya, (the effect of which would not, however, he very great unless there is a noticeable increase in the number of receiving sets in this country), hut also hy means of propaganda, if possible, in the press.I -3- Radio propaganda could be counteracted by broadcasts of news in Persian by the British Broadcasting Corporation, on lines similar to that organisation’s present broadcasts in Arabic; these broadcasts, to have full value, should begin immediately on the outbreak of hostilitieso The possibility of propaganda in the press is dependent upon the general attitude of the Iranian Government, since the press as a whole is strictly government-controlledo The official agency already receives the British Official News, from which it drav/s to a fair extent for its material; if the Iranian Government were friendly-disposed, it would not be difficult to secure the publication of many more extracts. This might be facilitated by the a-ppointment in Tehran of a special press officer, whose main duties would be to maintain contact with the Agence Pars. To him would also fall the task of counteracting attempts by the Italians to discredit British commercial concerns in Iran, such as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Iran. He also could usefully concern himself with the distribution of British films, official or otherwise. These, if provided free, would probably be extensively exhibited, particularly in view of the dearth of modern films in Iran due to the lack of the foreign exchange necessary to secure them. 5. I feel it is certain that the Italians would do their best to exploit Persian grievances against us in the Gulfo It would therefore be essential to-4' e remove these so far as possible. Thus,for example, any steps which the Persians night conceivably take as inimical to their nationals in Bahrein would have to be avoided. I think also that it would become necessary to transfer the Residency from Bushire without delay, as the functions of the Political Resident in time of war would in all probability be such as the Iranian Government would regard as incompatible with his residence in a neutral country. 6. The Persian Gulf is of course the key to the whole problem; as long as the Royal Navy holds control there I think we can count on Iranian neutrality; once control is lost there, any attempts to secure or retain Persian friendship may well prove futile. If control in the Gulf were lost, I do not think Iran would be able to resist the temptation to seize the oil industry, a step which would no doubt be urged upon her by the enemy Government, and to try to extend Persian political influence along its shores. 7. To sum up; I recommend (a) that the nucleus of an organisation for propaganda and broadcasting in Persian should be organised, to be brought into use immediately on the outbreak of war: (b) that His Majesty*s Government should be prepared, on the outbreak of war, to offer to make up, either by supply from the United Kingdom, or by financing purchases elswhere, the loss to Iran which would be entailed by the interruption of her imports from the enemy countries. The offer might be to finance or £1,000,000 . supply such imports up to, say, one million pounds in the first place. The terns would have to be a-5— j9 » \ matter of arrangement; Iran could probably repay part of the expense: the rest would be a disguised subsidy. It should not, in view of the shah r s known views on foreign loans, be suggested that the assistance offered should take the form of a loan, I have, etc., (Signed) E.J.

On more than one occasion I have compared the position of Ibn Saud, in the case of the outbreak of such a war as your despatch envisages, with that of the Ottoman Empire in August 1914; our enemies could promise him all he v/ants, without cost to themselves, Ibn Saud claims specifically Aqaba and Ma’an, with a corridor connecting his kingdom with Syria, and Jabal Naqsh and Khor el Odeid, and the enemies of Great Britain would doubtless promise him these, and give him a free hand with the Arab States on the Persian Gulf. Ibn Saud is however a far-seeing man, and would not join our enemies unless he was certain that they were going to win, since to be found on the other side at the end of an unsuccessful struggle would mean ruin, and at the beginning of a war he might be expected merely to try to get the best terms for his neutrality. It would almost certainly be useless to expect him to fight on our side, and indeed it does not seem clear to me that his help would be more useful than his benevolent neutrality, except perhaps in the eventuality of an attack on the Aden Pro tectorate by the Imam of the Yemen. Ibn Saud would probably The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., etc., etc., etc. , The Foreign Office.-2- ask for those territorial concessions which he has con sistently asked for in peace-time - Jabal Naqsh and Khor el Odeid; and as to Aqaba and Ma 1 an, the least he would demand would be a definite guarantee that they would never be handed over to his enemy, the Amir Abdullah, without the restraining hand of Great Britain to hold him in check. If, as seems probable, His Majesty’s Government were unable to make any concession on these points, their re fusal would drive up the price of Ibn Baud’s neutrality in other coin, 3. The experience of the Great War suggests, I think, that what neutrals like best is to be able to pursue their normal affairs with the least possible interference from belligerents, and I conclude from that experience, and from what we know of Ibn Baud, that he would be glad if three forms of activity in his country could continue with the minimum of hindrance, viz. the pilgrimage; the development of the Hasa oil field (and of the Parsan field, in the unlikely event of oil being found there in commercial quantities); and the reorganisation of the Saudi army which is referred to in my despatch No. 132 dated 28th June, 1938, These three points may be considered one by one. 4. The pilgrimage. The King is interested in this on religious as well as on financial grounds. Moreover, a numerous pilgrimage offers political advantages to Saudi Arabia in that what the pilgrims spend in addition to the Government dues helps to keep the Hejaz quiet. We ought therefore to do our best to keep the pilgrimage up to a paying level, by seeing that lack of shipping shall not prevent any pilgrims from executing their pious intention. If in spite of our efforts the pilgrimage fell off-3- ftp HAxi “ j) Lm+c~* lv&lt;vj ; It Gaa*. Ltip 4xbiM*k r -*r ! f (X*C*H*4t*4*e4&gt;4 4 J&amp; 1 ** Q. Kbi' J f iv*A.b /xd-u^4* considerably, His Majesty’s Government might consider the possibility of compensating the Saudi Arabian Government for the consequent loss of revenue. To ascertain the loss would, however, involve complicated calculations, as pilgrims from the various countries are under different tariffs, and moreover some of the charges (e.g. those represented by the fact that the state holds some of the shares in the transport company) are indirect and in other respects also are difficult to ascertain exactly. It would be simpler to give a subsidy in round figures that took no account of the exact losses on the pilgrimage. 5. As the Hasa oil-field is being developed by an American company, the work would suffer no direct inter ference if the United States Government remained neutral. There might however be difficulty in obtaining the necessary material or the shipping to carry it, and His Majesty’s Government might be able to give assistance in this respect, e. g. by allowing the export of iron and steel from India to Hasa that would otherwise be taken for military purposes. No estimate of the cost of such assistance can be made. His Majesty’s Government might also give travelling facili ties to the American engineers and other members of the Hasa staff, if these should be required. And if war con ditions resulted in a reduction of the demand for Hasa oil, His Majesty’s Government could perhaps take enough to make up the shortage, even if they did not require it urgently. But here again a general subsidy might be the best means of making up the loss. 6. The Parsan oil wells present a special problem, in that the Company concerned is largely British and French, and that the islands are close to an Italian naval and air base. In these circumstances, and in view of the fact thatit seems doubtful whether oil will ever be found there in commercial quantities, it seems best to leave this factor aside, with the proviso that Ibn Saud would in this case also be disappointed if oil had been found and development was interrupted. 7. As I reported in my despatch No, 132 dated 28th June, 1938, Ibn Saud has just taken the preliminary steps towards the creation of ?. standing army of 'tens of thousands' of troops trained on more or less modern lines. To meet the cost he is dejjending on Hasa oil, but even if that source of revenue proves to be rich, a large army could probably absorb it all, and more, for some years. The arms, ammuni tion, and equipment for so large a force would cost a large sum, and so would the pay of the professional officers needed for the purpose. The present regular force is so small that it may be said that everything required for the proposed army has to be provided. 8. In case of war it might be possible to afford that assistance in aviation which seems to His Majesty's Govern ment to be impossible in peace conditions, but I do not recommend this strongly as I do not believe that the Saudis will be able, for many years to come, to do more than fly a few simple machines maintained for them by other people. 9. What store Ibn Saud sets by the Hejaz railway is well known. Whether it would be possible to set about the repair of the damaged portion of the line in the middle of a European war seems doubtful, but perhaps a promise could be given that the work would be executed wholly or partially at the expense of His Majesty's Government on the conclu sion of peace.- 5 - 10. Another project of importance is the construction of the Jedda-Mecca-Arafat and Jedda-Medina roads. In a recent despatch (No. 129 dated the 23rd June 1938) I described the present position of the project, which Saudi- Egyptian co-operation would have embarked upon before this but for disagreement as to the control of the work and the expenditure. Should a war break out before this project has been begun, His Majesty’s Government might offer to take the place of Egypt in financing a project which is not only of great interest to Ibn Saud but which if completed would greatly diminish the hardships suffered by pilgrims, and also increase the life of motor transport in Saudi Arabia - an important consideration in v/ar time. This would mean, according to present calculations, the xxrovision of a sum of £145,000, which might or might not be recoverable from the Egyptian waqfs, and of a sum of £100,000, which the Saudi Government might pay off out of the road tax on pilgrims. Por the repayment easy terms would have to be granted, for the number of pilgrims would fall off, and the sums already collected by the Saudi Government as Road Tax in 1937 and 1958 have doubtless not been paid into a separate account but thrown into the till for general purposes. 11. It may be taken for granted that whatever revenue he obtains, Ibn Saud will always need more money, and that a subsidy would not come amiss to him. During the Great War and afterwards, for a period of seven years or more, he received from His Majesty’s Government a subsidy of £5,000 a month, in addition to a large present of arms and ammunition whereas his rival, Husain, received a subsidy of (I quote from memory) £200,000 gold a month. Now it Is unlikely that yIbn Saud v^ill estimate his own value at the present time as less than that of his rival in 1916, It is true that Husain gave his active help (for what it was worth) in exchange for his subsidy, whereas I am assuming that we could not expect more than benevolent neutrality from Ibn Saud; but then we were helping Husain to attain his own ends, whereas the effect of neutrality upon Ibn Saud would be to cut him off from the attainment of his chief aims, viz. territorial acquisitions. We must be prepared, then, in the last resort, to pay a subsidy as 'JU+hAX* ^ r . great as was paid to Husain, though we ought to begin by asking for military help (if military help would be of use) fL 4mm ' *C/ ^ ■ *•'£?'' 1 in return for so large a subsidy. This subsidy would not x ^fr**\*r*a deck A, ^ include the cost of any arms, etc., which we found it possible to supply to Ibn Saud. 12. There are few officials - probably not more than three- who have any influence with the King, and to influence them in favour of His Majesty*s Government, and even to get in contact with them, might be difficult. It is unlikely that a sum of more than £25,000 could be usefully employed in this direction, 13. Apart from the Arabic wireless broadcasts any propaganda done in this country could only be effected with the King's consent and perhaps even his assistance. The press, which consists of two weekly newspapers of little influence at ordinary times, is entirely in the hands of the Government. If Ibn Saud decided to remain neutral he might be glad to have British propaganda in Arabic for distribution to influence the population in favour of his attitude, but the town population does not count for much, and the tribes - 6 -are illiterate, so that written propaganda would not he as useful here as in a European country v/here everybody reads. CVcuS • (‘uA (Cu. '{xMtf) ' it , fa k - f' X^Uv* h ‘fr**** tL. /vv-* v &gt; TClJUiU &gt;Ua*\&lt;a (uf O t . ) 14, It is unlikely that Ibn Saud would admit non-Moslem military advisers into the interior of his country, and the only Moslem advisers on whom we could rely, viz. Indians, would not be welcome to him either. As however we are supposing that he would probably be neutral this is not perhaps of great importance. It would however be valuable if a British officer of political experience could be at Riyadh, when the King was not in the Hejaz, in order to explain the situation to him day by day, and to help to counteract the enemy propaganda which would be reaching him by wireless and perhaps by other means also. It is not certain that the King would permit this, but the offer should be made. 15. These, then, to sum up, are the measures which might be taken to influence Ibn Saud in our favour:- (l) Pay him a subsidy which might have to be as large as the subsidy the Sharif Husain received during the Great War, and is not likely to be much smaller. (2) Help with arms and ammunition and equipment for his new regular army. (3) Consider v/hether help in aviation can be afforded. (4) Try to keep the pilgrimage running as far as possible, e.g. by seeing that shipping is not lacking. (5) Try to remove any hindrances to the development of the Hasa oil field that might result from war conditions, e.g, by giving passages to the staff, providing shipping and material, and if necessary helping to absorbthe output, or to make up in some other way any loss resulting from a falling off in sales, (6) Embark on the repair of the Hejaz railway if that is feasible, or - better - promise to carry out the work wholly or partially at the expense of His Majesty^ Government on the conclusion of peace. (7) Finance the Jedda-Mecca and Jedda-Medina road-building project, at a cost of £245,000, some of which might be recoverable, (8) Set aside a sura not exceeding £25,000 to be used, if opportunity offers, to influence one or two of the leading officials in our favour, (9) Provide some printed propaganda in Arabic if Ibn Saud consents to its being used. (10) Keep a political officer at Riyadh, if the King will allow it, to explain the situation as it develops and to counteract hostile propaganda. 16, The measures suitable for adoption, or at least for discussion with Ibn Saud, if war was imminent, would appear to be those numbered (2), (3), (6), (7), and possibly (9) and (10).

EXTRACT FROM CABINET CONCLUSIONS 36(38) DATED 28th July 1938. 2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of Conclusion 7 (c) of the draft Minutes of the 329th Meeting of the C.I.D., on the subject of a proposed contribution of £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi-Arabia section of the Hedjaz Railway, on which a decision had been reserved by the Cabinet at their previous Meeting pending the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ascertaining whether H.M.Minister at Jedda, who was now in London, realised the conditions attached to the proposed contribution. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Foreign Office had communicated by telephone with Sir R.Bullard, who was at Oxford. He adhered to his opinion that the £30,000 proposal would be most helpful. Both the possible difficulty for Ibn Saud of raising the larger sum (roughly estimated at £300,000) and the risk of the Railway being useless were present to his mind, but he felt strongly that those points had best be brought out at the meeting at Jedda and explained to Ibn Saud. In the meantime Sir R.Bullard much hoped that the £30,000 proposal might be approved. The Cabinet agrees:- To approve the following recommendations made by the C.I.D. at their 329th Meeting on the 19th July: ”(b) To authorise the F.O. to inform H.M.Minister at Jedda that H.M.G. agree to the holding of a Conference at Jedda, to be attended by representatives of Great Britain, France, Syria and Saudi Arabia, with a view to reaching an agreement as to the repair of the damaged portion of the Hedjaz Railway: (c) That at the Jedda Conference the British representative should be authorised to inform the representative of the Saudi Arabian Government that H.M.G. were prepared to contribute £30,000 towards2 . the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hedjaz Railway, provided that the Saudi Arabian Government were able to make satisfactory arrangements for obtaining the remainder of the estimated cost (i.e. some £300,000) of this section from other sources: (d) To note that the contribution of H.M.G. could not stop at £30,000, since the restoration of the Maan- Mudawara Section (without which the restoration of the Saudi- Arabian Section would be useless) would necessitate further expenditure, tentatively estimated at £100,000.'EXTRACT PROM CABINET CONCLUSIONS 35(38) DATED 27th JULY 1938. MEDITERRANEAN, MIDDLE EAST &amp; NORTH EAST AFRICA. (Previous Reference: Cabinet 9(38) Concl. 4.) 10. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (C.P.178(38)) circulating for the information of his colleagues at the request of the C.I.D., a Report by the Standing (Official) Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East (C.I.D. Paper N0.1447-B) on the measures which might be taken to Influence those minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance or even benevolent nertrality might be of •, value to us in time of war: together with the relevant extract from the draft Minutes of the 329th meeting of the C.I.D. (minute 7). In the course of the discussion some doubts were expressed as to conclusion (c) (That at the Jedda Conference the British representative should be authorised to Inform the representative of the Saudi Arabian Govt, that H.M.G. were prepared to contribute £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hedjaz Railway provided that the Saudi Arabian Govt. were able to make satisfactory arrangements for obtaining the remainder of the estimated cost (i.e., some £300,000) of this section from other sources). Questions were asked as to whether Ibn Saud realised that the contribution of £30,000 was only to be given on condition that he was able to find the remainder of the £300,000 required for the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabia Section of the Hedjaz Railway? Was it likely that Ibn Saud would be able to raise so large a sum? If not, was this proposal likely to be of much help? If', as stated in para.11 of Enclosure No.I to C.P.178(38), the railway was likely to prove an economic burden, would not Ibn Saud's satisfaction be converted into resentment?2 The Cabinet were informed that what had influenced the C.I.D. was that the proposal was reported to have originated with Ibn Saud himself, ihe Committee had been influenced to a considerable extent by the immediate situation in Palestine Ibn Saud might prove a very important factor in that \ situation so that the present proposals were perhaps more important from a short than from a long point of view. The idea of the C. I.D. has been that someone should go to Jedda to talk with Ibn Saud with authority, if he found it advisable, to make this offer of £30,000. The Cabinet were informed that Sir xteader Bullard, H.M.Minister at Jedda, on whose judgment the ?.0. relied, had been immensely pleased to hear of this proposal and had said that it would be most helpful. The Sfor Foreign Affairs said, however, that if the matter could be placed on the agenda again on the following day, he would like the opportunity to make sure that Sir deader Bullard had realised that the promise of £30,000 was conditional on Ibn Saud being able to raise the larger sum. Referring to conclusion (f) of the C.I.D. on the South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia (That, with a view to the settlement of the S.E. frontiers of Saudi ^rabia on lines acceptable to x bn Saud, the F.O. and I.O. should be authorised to take up the question of the cession by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of a strip of territory in the Persian Gulf known as the Khor-el-Odeid: and that, should compens ation in the form of a cash payment prove necessary, the expenditure of a sum tentatively estimated at £25,000 for this purpose should be provisionally authorised, subject to the usual arrangements for obtaining Treasury sanction), the S/S for India warned the Cabinet that the G.of 1. saw strong objections to the proposal to take up the question of the3 cession by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of a strip of territory in the Persian Gulf known as the Khor-el-Odeid, as they thought that this would have a serious effect on the Trucial Chiefs. He was prepared, however, to discuss the matter further with the G.of I. The Minister for Co-ordination of defence, in reply to the Prime Minister, said that apart from conclusion (c) which had been reserved, the Cabinet need only take note of the remaining conclusions of the C.I.D. The Cabinet agreed: (a) To take note of the conclusions of the C.I.D. at the 329th meeting as-set-ferth-abeve, subject to - (b) The reservation of conclusion (c) on the subject of a proposed contribution of £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi ^rabia Section of the Bedjaz Hailway until a meeting to be held on the following day; (c) That in the interval the S/S for F.a. should ascertain whether H.M.Minister at Jedda, who is now in London, realised the conditions attached to the proposed contribution of £30,000.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAKHIC MAJEi, SECRET M.E.(O') 270 COMMITTEE Op IMPSRL^I.

MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH-EAST AFRICA REPORT. THE Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East have had under consideration the following conclusions of the 315th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence :— “ (iii) That the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee should investigate and report on the measures which might be taken, either before or on the outbreak of war, to influence those Minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war (paragraph 259). (xiii) That the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee should investigate and report on the possibilities of the overland route from Mombasa to Egypt as a reinforcement route to Egypt.” Overland Route f rom Mombasa to Egypt. 2. With reference to conclusion (xiii) above, the Sub-Committee have taken evidence from the Inspector-General of the King’s African Rifles and West African Frontier Force, who has recently completed a journey over the route from Mombasa to Egypt. They have also invited the War Office, in consultation with the Air Ministry, to arrange for a memorandum in a form suitable for despatch to the British Ambassador at Cairo and to the Governments of Kenya and Uganda, asking that certain information regarding the route from Mombasa to Egypt should be checked and verified. On receipt of this information a report by the Sub-Committee will be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence. Measures to Influence Minor Powers and Arab States. 3. The measures to influence Minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war referred to in conclusion (iii) of the 315th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence fall under two heads :— (a) Measures required in the event of war or imminent war; (b) Measures which might be taken before the outbreak of war. 4. As regards the measures required in the event of war or imminent war, the Sub-Committee, as a preliminary to reporting to the Committee of Imperial [17515] ' B2 Defence, have invited the Foreign Office and other Government Departments concerned to obtain the views of His Majesty’s representatives in the following countries :— Saudi Arabia, Iraq. Egypt and Sudan, Transjordan, When these views have been received the matter will again be considered by the Sub-Committee and a report submitted. 5. The present Report therefore deals with the measures to influence Minor Powers and Arab States which might be taken forthwith without waiting until war was imminent. These may be summarised as :— (i) Possible assistance to Ibn Saud in the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hedjaz railway. (ii) The proposal for the provision of an all-Arab Port on the Mediterranean coast. (iii) Frontier questions at issue with the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. (iv) The supply of arms to Ibn Saud and other Arab States. (i) Possible assistance to Ibn Saud in the reconstruction of the Saudi A rabian section of the Hedjaz Railway. 6. The Hedjaz Railway, which runs from Syria to Medina, suffered much -damage in the Great War. The sections in what are now Syria, Palestine and Transjordan have to a great extent been restored, and the line is functioning as far south as Maan in Transjordan. But the section from Maan to the Saudi- Transjordan frontier at Mudawara needs extensive repairs, and the section from Mudawara to Medina, though partially restored after the War, has since become derelict, and remained so mainly because the Government of Ibn Saud have never been able to meet the cost of repairing it. The restoration of the section from Maan to Mudawara has as a consequence not been attempted. The cost of restoring the Saudi-Arabian section might be as much as £300,000 and the Transjordan section £100.000, but these are only tentative estimates and need confirmation. 7. The Railway was built some time before the War with capital raised partly by voluntary contribution from Moslems all the world over, and partly from taxation and other sources. The purpose of the railway was ostensibly purely religious, to enable pilgrims to travel easily and quickly to the Holy Cities; but, in point of fact, it had also a military object, and was intended to strengthen Turkey’s hold on Arabia, It has for many years been an aim of the Saudi Arabian Government to reopen this line to pilgrim traffic, Ibn Saud himself attaching great sentimental value to its restoration. Several efforts have in recent years been made by the Saudi Arabian Govern ment to induce His Majesty’s Government and the French Government to admit the principle that the Railway, the ownership and administration of which is now divided between Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and Saudi Arabia, should be treated as one indivisible whole, and that all the Governments concerned should contribute to the restoration of the derelict section in Saudi Arabia. Neither His Majesty’s Government nor the French Government have been able to accept this contention. 8. The Saudi Arabian Government have recently again requested His Majesty’s Government and the French Government to examine a proposal that the whole line from Syria to Medina should be taken over, exploited and administered by some international company, e.r/., the International Sleeping Car Company. The Saudi Arabian Government profess to see no difficulty in raising the necessary capital to achieve the restoration of the derelict section in Saudi Arabia, provided the functioning of the line as a whole by an international combine can be assured in advance. Iran, Turkey and Aden.8 9. No reply has yet been returned to this communication from the Saudi Arabian Government: and the Sub-Committee have discussed the question whether some offer to assist in the restoration of the Saudi Arabian section of the railway might help to secure the continued goodwill of Ibn Saud. If so, such assistance would evidently constitute a measure to influence the Saudi Arabian Government, ^ as contemplated in the present memorandum. It would also be in accordance with the policy of the Cabinet conclusion of the 22nd December, 1937, regarding the desirability in principle of exploring the possibility of financial assistance generally to Ibn Saud. The Foreign Office Representative on the Sub-Committee has suggested that the reconstruction of the Railway presents an exceptional opportunity of giving such assistance in a matter on which Ibn Saud has set his heart and which he thinks, rightly or wrongly, will benefit his country and the interests of Islam generally; and he has recommended that a start should be made by an offer from His Majesty’s Government to contribute £30,000 (this being the sum which the Syrian Government and Ibn Saud himself seem prepared to contribute) towards the estimated cost (i.e., some £300,000) for the Saudi Arabian section, without prejudice to the necessity of increasing this offer later. 10. The Foreign Office have also suggested that, if an offer is made, it should be accompanied by some stipulation that the contribution shall be properly used and applied to the purposes for which it is intended, the remainder of the money being raised from elsewhere, and at the same time some constructive suggestion put forward (since it is unlikely that any international company could be formed in practice) to the effect that the Saudi Arabian Government might appoint the Palestine Railway Administration to be their managing agents for the carrying out, through agreed contractors, of the work of reconstruction and thereafter for the operation of the Saudi Arabian Section, at the expense of the Saudi Arabian Government, until such time as other arrangements could be made. 11. As against this various objections are seen in other quarters. In the first place, it is suggested that an offer of £30,000, if made subject to conditions which might not be^ possible of fulfilment, particularly in regard to raising the much larger residue of the money required, would not gain any lasting gratitude from Ibn Saud and might merely render necessary much larger offers, ending even with His Majesty's Government being obliged to bear the greater part of the expense. In any case, the contribution of His Majesty’s Government could not stop at £30,000, since the restoration of the Maan-Mudawara section (without which the restoration of the Hedjaz section would be useless) would need another contribution, tentatively estimated at £100,000. Moreover, as it is common ground that the restored line would be most unlikely to be a commercial success, they might be faced with recurrent annual deficits on running in respect of the Transjordan section. Finally, it is suggested that if Ibn Saud were to discover, as he inevitably would, that the restored Railway was a burden instead of an asset, his gratitude for any contribution His Majesty’s Government might have made would turn to resentment at the action of His Majesty's Government in encouraging him in an unprofitable venture, which might mean that His Majesty’s Government would have to bear the deficit on running the Saudi Arabian section also. 12. The Foreign Office admit to the full the force of these arguments. But the point to which they attach importance (on exclusively political grounds and because of the need in the present international situation of neglecting no opportunity of influencing Ibn Saud in favour of this country) is that a gesture should be made to Ibn Saud which would show him that His Majesty's Govern ment, while feeling it their duty to make it unmistakably plain to the Saudi Arabian Government that the reconstruction of the line was most unlikely ever to be a profitable concern, are nevertheless sympathetic in principle towards a project in which the Moslem world is keenly interested. Moreover they consider f a further important point to be that the offer should be communicated to the Saudi Arabian Government at the earliest possible opportunity. The next year or so constitutes the dangerous period, when Ibn Saud's friendship is essential. In the most favourable circumstances the Railway is unlikely to be working within that time, and difficulties thereafter in operating the line are likely to be less important. The Railway may even never be operated at all, whatever [17515] n 2offer His Majesty's Government may make. But from the political point of view the important thing is, not that the Railway should be operated successfully, but that the Saudi Government should be influenced in favour of this country by an offer to assist them in a project which they have at heart. As regards the possibility that an offer of £30,000 might merely lead His Majesty s Govern ment into a position in which much larger offers might be necessary, the Foreign Office have never regarded £30,000 as a final figure. Nevertheless, if it were represented to Ibn Saud that in addition to this sum (w^hich they would represent as a token payment or gesture of goodwill), His Majesty s Government would have to undertake at their own sole expense the reconstruction of the Maan- Mudawara section, they could probably insist without incurring resentment that £30,000 was the outside limit of the assistance wdiich they would give in the form of money to the Saudi Arabian section. 13. It may be added that the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan strongly supports, on political grounds, the suggestion of the Foreign Office and urges that if anything is done it should he done soon. 14. In the circumstances the Sub-Committee can only put the reconstruction of the Railway forward as one way in which it has been suggested it would be possible to spend money with the object of obtaining an immediate, though possibly not a lasting, benefit in the form of gratitude from Ibn Saud. (ii) Proposal for the Provision of an All-Arab Port on the Mediterranean ('oast. 15. It is understood that for commercial, and even more for aentimental reasons, the desire for a port on the Mediterranean coast under exclusively Arab control is strongly felt among the Arab States in the Middle East. Control of Beirut and Alexandretta having been denied to them by the inclusion of these ports in the Lebanese Republic and the independent Sanjak respectively, the satisfaction of Arab aims must be sought, if at all, in Palestine. The question of the future political status of Palestine is at present under consideration by the Palestine Partition Commission, and it cannot be assumed at the present stage that any particular scheme of partition of Palestine will be adopted; but it seems not unlikely that under any scheme of partition the port of Haifa would fall either under Jewish or British, but not under Arab, control. The outline scheme of the Palestine Royal Commission provided for the inclusion of Jaffa in the independent Arab State, with which, however, it would not be geographically connected. The only alternative port which could be included in Arab territory would be that at Gaza, which is at present in an entirely undeveloped state. The question is one which the Palestine Partition Commission can hardly fail to take into consideration when preparing their Report. (iii) Frontier questions at issue with the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. (a) South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi A rabia. 16. It has recently become apparent that a settlement of the long-standing dispute over the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Trucial Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf might be secured were it possible to concede to Ibn Saud territory which w^ould give him access to the Persian Gulf at the Khor-el-Odeid. This cannot in any case be done without the agreement of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who owns the territory in question. In order to secure his agreement, it would presumably be necessary to offer him some form of compensation, possibly including a payment in cash. Objections have in some quarters been advanced on political and strategical grounds to allowing Ibn Saud a footing on the Trucial Coast, and the question how far, if at all, it is politically desirable to make the concession, and for that purpose to try to persuade the Sheikh to part with some of his territory with or I without the offer of money for doing so, is still the subject of inter-departmental discussion, and the Sub-Committee do not wish to make any recommendation upon this point. But a settlement of the South-Eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia is in itself an object which it would unquestionably be well worth while to attain at the expense of a reasonable financial outlay—if that should be the only price to be paid—both as a means of securing the'goodwill of Ibn Saud in the presentinternational situation and on the longer view of peace and security in Eastern Arabia. Without prejudice, therefore, to the consideration of the question in its wider aspects, the Sub-Committee suggest that expenditure with the object of settling the South-Eastern frontier question is a possible way in which His Majesty s Government might usefully use their financial resources as suggested by the Committee of Imperial Defence. I he amount necessary cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy. But a figure of £25,000 might provisionally be authorised for this purpose. (b) The King of the Y('men and Shabwa. 17. In June 1937 proposals were under consideration for the conclusion of an agreement between His Majesty's Government and the tribes of the Shabwa area in the Aden Protectorate. In September, however, before any such agreement had been concluded, the King of the Yemen protested against the attitude of the Aden authorities in respect of these tribes, and represented that the Shabwa area formed part of the Yemen, alleging that administrative action by the Aden authorities in this area was a breach of Article III of the Treaty of Sanaa. His Majesty’s Government have resisted this claim, but have adopted the attitude that, while they claim all territory up to the “ violet ” line (i.e., the line agreed with the Turks before the war), the King of the Yemen is not precluded by the Treaty of Sanaa from disputing their claim. They have suggested that, at some convenient date, there should be an informal and friendly discussion between representatives of the two Governments with a view to arriving at an agreed settlement of the boundary in this area. Meanwhile, negotiations with the Shabwa tribes have been deferred. The matter is a very live issue at the present time owing to the fact that the King of the Yemen has recently shown signs of intervening actively in the Shabwa area. 18. The situation was discussed at a recent meeting of the Middle East Sub-Committee, and it was agreed that the Governor of Aden should be informed :— (a) that negotiations with the Shabwa should not be proceeded with for the present. (b) that the Imam should be invited to enter upon a friendly discussion of the whole question of the Shabwa area. (c) that the previous decision of His Majesty’s Government, that any attempt by the Imam to seize the territory by force should be resisted, must stand, and that the Imam .should be informed beforehand of our intentions. (d) that the Governor of Aden should be informed that His Majesty’s Government concur in his view that the Shabwa area is of small importance to us, either from the political or strategical point of view. (Some criticism of this view has, however, been expressed bv Mr. Ingrams, Resident Adviser in the Hadhramaut.) 19. It might be possible to placate the King of the Yemen by conceding forthwith his claim to the Shabwa area; but it was agreed at the meeting of the Middle East Sub-Committee referred to above that the best policy was for the Governor of Aden to endeavour to start negotiations with the Imam on a friendly basis. It was felt that if, as the outcome of such negotiations, it was finally decided to abandon our claim to the Shabwa area, the prestige of His Majesty’s Government would not suffer to the same extent as if we abrogated our claim without negotiation. It may be said, therefore, that, so far as this question is •concerned, the possibility of placating the King of the Yemen by some concession in this area is being kept fully in mind. (iv) The Supply of Anns to I bn Sand and the Arab States. 20. This question can be considered under two heads :— (a) The sale of arms to independent rulers who are anxious to purchase from His Majesty’s Government.6 (b) The free provision of arms to those rulers who are dependent in greater or lesser degree upon His Majesty's Government for protection, and who are unable to afford to purchase the arms they require. » Category (a) includes Saudi x\rabia and the Yemen. Category (b) includes Koweit, the Tracial Sheikhs, Mascat, and m the Sheikhs of the Aden Protectorate. ™ (a) The Yemen and Saudi Arabia. 21. In the past the Yemen and Saudi Arabia have made enquiries from His Majesty’s Government as to the availability of war material and the terms on which it could be supplied to them. In the case of the \emen no orders were placed, presumably because we were unable to meet their requirements either as regards delivery or terms of purchase. It is believed that the \ emen is about to place large orders with the Italians, who have made offers at much reduced prices and on easy terms of repayment. In the case of Saudi Arabia we were able to supply machine guns and field guns last year up to the amount which Ibn Sand was able to pay in cash. He is now engaged in negotiations with various continental countries for further supplies. While it is understood that present conditions preclude the provision of even obsolete or obsolescent war material for these States, it is suggested that any future opportunity of meeting their requirements should as far as possible be met. To make the transactions attractive, it is important that the prices quoted should be as low and the terms of payment as easy as possible. In the case of Saudi Arabia especially, low prices and easy terms are the main consideration. (b) The Minor Arab Sheikhdoms. 22. The importance of the States situated along the coast of Arabia from Koweit to Aden lies in the air routes which pass through them and the oil installa tions (particularly in Bahrein) which they contain. 1 hese States are liable, even in peace, to attack by marauding Arab tribes from the interior, and the oil installations offer a tempting object for sabotage or for attack with loot as the primary incentive. In war or in time of general unrest in the Middle East, these dangers may be considerably increased, particularly if the larger Arabian States were unfriendly to Great Britain, or unable to restrain their less amenable tribes. 23. It is suggested that we could consolidate our relations with these minor States and improve their ability to safeguard our interests, as well as their own, against local attack, internal or external, by offering them comparatively small amounts of small arms and ammunition. Such arms and ammunition might be ■ , issued to local levies raised and maintained in peace time, or might be stored for issue to levies which would be raised in time of emergency. It is suggested that f, this problem might be investigated by the local British Authorities in order to fl produce a detailed plan. Conclusions. 24. Our conclusions on the question of the measures to influence Minor Powers and Arab States which might be taken before the outbreak of war may be summarised as follows :— (i) The Saudi Arabian Section of the Hedjaz Railway. That, whilst the proposal is fraught with many difficulties, the recon struction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hedjaz Railway is worth consideration as one possible means by which an immediate, though possibly not lasting, benefit in the form of gratitude from Tbn Saud might be obtained (paragraphs 6-14). (ii) Proposal for the provision of an All-Arab Port. That the proposal for the provision of an all-Arab Port is one which cannot be carried further pending the report of the Palestine Partition Commission (paragraph 15).7 (iii) Frontier questions at issue with the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. Rastern frontier of Saudi Arabia is a proposal worthy of consideration (paragraph 16). (b) That the Departments concerned should continue to examine the possibility of placating the King of the Yemen by some concession in the Shabwa area (paragraphs 17-19). {iv) The Supply of A rms to Ibn Saud and other A rab States. (a) That any future opportunity of meeting the arms requirements of the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen should as far as possible be met. To make the transaction attractive, it is important that the prices quoted should be as low and the terms of payment as easy as possible. (b) That our relations with the Minor Arab Sheikhdoms might be con- i solidated, and their ability to safeguard our interests as well as their own improved, by offering them comparatively small amounts of small arms and ammunition; and that this problem might be investigated by the local British authorities in order to produce a detailed plan i (paragraphs 20-23).

G-iFA ~J) 9 Inspector General of the hiny’ s .African Hifles and West African Frontier Force, ,ave a description of a journey he had recently undertaken over the route from Mombasa to Sg^rpt. He did not think that there v/ere any difficulties as regards tne capacity o^. tne . c-nya— Uganda railway which ran as far as ooroti. ^.c had, however, brought home with him tne latest report on one railway and handed it to the War Office. fhe Director of Railways hoc. informed him that tne sidings at ooroci could easily be extended. The country around was suite flat. • A survey to Lira 60 or TO miles further west ha.d been completed and tne Director of Railways had informed him that it would be possible to lay that railway at the rate of about a mile a day. The road from Soroti to Juba was an all- weather road canable of taking two streams of traffic. except in a few snort stretches where it crossed swamps. -In these areas some form of traffic controlJuba-Kostwould Tdg nccesaary. Prom Soroti the road went via Lira and Gulu to Laropi, At Laropi, which lies south-west of Nimule, there is a ferry over the Nile, whence a road ran via the west Lank to Juba, This road ran North-west for some distance until it joined the road from Juba to the Belgian Congo. He had not seen the road west of the Nile. The new road follows the old one via Gulu to Attiak whence a road direct to Nimule is being con structed. The first 30 odd miles had been cleared leaving 11 still to be cleared but it had not been made all-weather although work was now proceeding. At the river Unyama, about 7 or 8 miles from Nimule, there were concrete bridges capable of talcing one-way traffic. It was thought that the track Attiak- Nimule would be made into a perfectly sound all-weather road in the course of this year. Prom Nimule to a point opposite Juba on the right bank of the Nile, there was a first-class all weather road capable of taking traffic in both directions. Prom Juba traffic is water-borne by Nile steamers to Kosti, whence the route proceeds 800 miles by rail to Wadi Haifa - the Sudan Government Railways. In reply to a question by the Chairman, he said that the route ran its whole length through British territory. He was not aware of the capacity of the river Nile, but he understood that imormation on this subject as to the number of troops which could be transported by steamer was being obtained. The ferry at Juba was capable of taking lour mobor carst -3- or lorries across at a time.» He did not think there would be much difficulty in constructing quays, etc., on the bank opposite to Juba, as there appeared to be plenty of deep water pretty well up to the bank, and the draught of the steamers was about S'e*' to 4 1 . Leaving aside the river he was of opinion that the route he traversed was perfectly feasible for traffic at all times of the year. In reply to a further question by the Chairman, he said that the distance by road from Soroti to Juba was about 300 miles and he thought it would take a convoy from two to three days to do the journey. COLONEL THORP, replying to a question by the Chairman, understood that the Sub-Committee were to consider the route from the point of view of whether it would be possible to despatch a small force fpon Mombasa to Egypt and to work out the time this would take. Reinforcements from India were contemplated. The War Office had worked out a provisional timing from Mombasa to Cairo. This, of course, had only been done on the information they had been able to receive and it would have to be verified. In reply to questions, Colonel Thorp said that the journey from Juba—Kosti would take approximately nine days down stream, and sixteen days up stream; these timings being liable to variation according to the state of the river. He added, in reply to a question by the Chairman, that the calculations had been based on a force of approximately one Brigade or 3,000 men.-4- GEHErjLL GIPPAP.D did not finticipate that there would be any difficulty in obtaining sufficient motor transport locally to move this force,, In discussion it was pointed out that it would take approximately 7 days to move this force from Khartoum to Cairo. As regards the time to transport a force along the whole route 3 COLONEL Ti'ORF said it had been estimated that the leading troops would reach Cairo from Mombasa in about 28 days from the time they left Mombasa P and that the whole force could be concentrated in Cairo in about 37 days* GENERAL GIERARD pointed out river transport from Juba to Khartoum would be the weak link. COLONEL THORP agreed. THE CHAIRMAN asked whether further surveys were being made. COLONEL THORP said it had been suggested that it might be possible to get further information from the local officials. At the moment the War Office did not intend to send anybody to survey the route from the War Office as it was felt that information could be obtained from the authorities in the Sudan and elsewhere to check and supplement the figures already available. MR. PASKIN assumed that if it was desired that the Colonial Office should make enquiries on any points on which the Service Departments required further information 5 they would be furnished with precise particulars of the information desired.-5- MR* PINK suggested that it would he necessary to enquire from the Sudan Government as to the river transport likely to he available-* He did not imagine that this would he very much* as the amount of trade helow the river at Khartoum was smallo GENERAL GIPPARD said that from the figures he had seen he thought that some 40 odd steamers would he available. COLONEL THORP explained that from Juba to Kosti there were 24 steamers* 11 tugs and 92 barges. He thought that the Memorandum* which had been prepared by the War Office on General Giffard’s report* should be sent to the Sudan Government with a questionnaire asking for further details. A copy of the Memorandum would be handed in for circulation to the Sub-Committee. After discussion* it was agreed that the Memorandum and questionnaire should be sent* not only to the Sudan Government* but also to the authorities in Egypt* Kenya and Uganda. GROUP-CAPTAIN CORYTON considered that the Memorandum should also be examined from the point of view of reinforcements of material. It was hoped to complete an aerodrome at Mombasa* and the Air Ministry would desire to know the maximum tonnage and size of packages* etc.* which could be transported by the various roads* railways* etc. THE CHAIRMAN suggested* and it was agreed* that the best method would be for the War Office and Air Ministry to consult together before the Memorandum was completed with a vie?/ to framing a questionnaire that would cover all the relevant points.MR*SEAL raised the question of the vulnerability of the route to air attack, and the necessity for some measure of anti-aircraft defence. COLONEL THORP explained that this point v/ould be considered in the plans for moving the force. THE CHAIRMAN summarised the discussion and suites ted that the War Office in consultation rith the Air Ministry should be invited to prepare a memorandum in a form suitable to be despatched to the British Ambassador at Cairo and to the Government of the Sudan? Kenya and Uganda, asking that certain information in regard to the route from Mombasa to Egypt should be checked and verified. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed. CONCLUSIONS, THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - (a) To invite the War Office, in consultation with the Air Ministry, to arrange for a memorandum to be prepared in a form suitable for despatch to the British Ambassador at Cairo and to the Governments of the Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, asking that certain information regarding the route from Mombasa to Egypt should be checked and verified, (b) That,on receipt of the information referred to above,a report should be prepared for submission to the Committee of Imperial Defence on the possibilities of the overland route from Mombasa to Egypt as a reinforce ment route, in accordance with Conclusion (xiii) of the Minutes of the 515th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,-7- M'SAbUH'Sb TU INFLUEHCH: MINOR Pow^kb Al^Jj ARAB bTATgb. (Papers Nos. M.E.(O) 261, 263, 264, 265, 266 and 267). THE SUB-COMMITTEE had under consideration the following Papers : Conclusion (iii) of the 315th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence.

Memorandum by the Colonial Office. (Paper No. M.E.(O) 266). Memorandum by the India Office. (Paper No. M.E.(o) 267). THE CHAIRMAN recalled that the Conclusion of the Committee of Imperial Defence regarding the measures which might be taken to influence Minor Powers and Arab States had been recorded on the 25th March. At that time the conversations with Italy were in their early stages. Since then the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April had been concluded. As a result there had been a marked change in the general international atmosphere since the Committee of Imperial Defence recorded their Conclusion^ This was a factor which must clearly be borne in mind. A number of memoienda had been circulated to the Committee but, as the questions at issue were primarily a Foreign Ofiice matter, he would ask the Foreign office representative to open the discussion.MR. BAXTER explained that the Foreign Orifice Memorandum (Paper No. M.E.(o) 265) was of a tentative nature and had been prepared as a basis of discussion. The Foreign Office would like, as a result of to-day’s discussions, to prepare a despatch to His Majesty’s representatives in the countries concerned asking for their views. Discussion ensued as to the scope of the countries which were affected by the measures under consideration, MAJOR CA'VTHORN explained that when the Joint Planning Committee were preparing the Middle East portion of the appreciation (C. 0. S. 691)^. in regard to which the Committee of Imperial Defence Conclusion was recorded, it became apparent that it might be necessary for us to use overland communications, as an alternative to the Suez Canal, and that therefore it was felt that some measures must be taken to ensure that we could reasonably count on the friendship or neutrality of the peoples through whose territories the routes ran. After further discussion it was agreed that the discussion should cover the following territories Saudi-Arabia, Iraq. Egypt and Sudan, The Yemen. Syria, Transjordan.Tif&gt;J JiLuiXM/iN suggested that tv/o types of measures would have to be considered. Firstly, measures that could be carried out im iediately, and secondly measures to be undertaken on the outbreak of war. MAJok UAJTHuRN agreed that the idea was to consider temporary measures that might be taken now in the case of a sudden emergency, and long-range measures to ensure that the attitude of the people concerned would be, if not friendly, at least neutral, Trlh JliAitaAR considered that long-range measures to ensure continued friendliness in the countries concerned were matters of high policy which seemed to him rather beyona the purview of the bub-Committee. He suggested that, in the first instance, at any rate, the discussion should be narrowed down to what might be described as ''immediate' measures, such as those proposed in the memoranda circulated by the Foreign office and other Departments. He would start with the suggestions put forward in the Foreign office memorandum (Paper No. M.'L.(o) h65). The first was the question of assistance to baudi Arabia in the reconstruction of the oaudi Arabian beet ion of the iledjaz railway. The Foreign office baudi Arabian Section of the Hed.iaz Railway ^y. proposal was that we might advance money to the baudi- Arabian G-overnment to h-.lv them to reconstruct this section. 'V This would presumably mean that we ourselves or the Trans jordan Government would have to reconstruct the Trans-Jordan-10- section that had fallen into disuse; one section would be no use without the other. The British Ezcheguer might have to find the money towards both. There was also the question of finding annual sums required for the upkeep of the railway, if it ran at a loss. MR. BAGGALLAY did not consider that we should commit ouselves to any responsibility as to pay lent for upkeep. He thought, however, that it was very necessary that a gesture should be made which would at least show Ibn Saud that we were sympathetic to the idea and did not wish to block it entirely. In reply to a question by Colonel Thorp, he said that Ibn Saud definitely wanted the railway, but he though it would be only fair to warn him that it was a doubtful financial proportion. MR. DO'VNIE was of opinion that our support of the proposal should be conditional on a scheme being worked out and proper estimates prepared. He thought the whole scheme would probably cost about £300,000. He pointed out that while we should no dcubt require Saudi-Arabia to meet the annual deficit on their section, His Majesty’s Government would have to bear the less on the Transjordan section. MR. HALE said it would be clear that, in present financial circumstances, a very high degree of necessity would have to be shown for expenditure on a project of this nature before it could be justified. He felt, however, doubtful whether we should get any enduring gratitude from Ibn Saud for a gesture of this nature. He thought it was clear that if we did anything we should probably in the end have to put up the whole of the money, not only for reconstructing the Transjordan Section but for the railway down to Medina, and that in practice we should find that we had only male the position worse if the railway fhiled to work satisfactorily*-11- He understood that there would be little demand for the railway for the purposes of pilgrim traffic; and there was, of course, an alternative route by sea. A heavy- loss on the railway must be assumed and unless we bore that loss the effect of erecting a railway, which after wards either failed to work, or was a constant drain on Ibn Gaud's finances, would be worse than if nothing had been done. THE CHAIPIIAIT thought that there would be great difficulty in asking Parliament to vote money for an enter prise which was foredoomed to meet with a financial failure. The argument that the expenditure represented an essential political gesture would not be an easy one to sustain. MR. BAGGALLAY explained that all the ideas of spending money put forward in the Foreign Office Paper had the object of tiding ourselves over a very dangerous period in the next year or two. In reply to a question, he said that in the offer to Ibn Saud it should be made quite clear that we should expect a reasonable plan to be made out by Ibn Saud which would show where the rest of the money required for the project would come from. THE CHAIRMAN thought that the exact form of approach to Ibn Saud would have to be carefully considered. He asked whether there had been recent correspondence with him on the subject. MR. BAGGALLAY replied that Ibn Saud had sent a note on this question two years ago to which no reply had been sent. More recently he had made enquiries as to when he might expect an answer.TIIC CHAIRMAN asked whether our ap roach might not take the form of an offer to investigate this question on Ibn Saud’s behalf, with a view to determining whether there was any way in which the railv/ay could be re-opened without financial loss. This at least would take some time, and might tide over the period of danger. When the figures had been worked out it should be possible to demonstrate to him that the project was quite impracticable on financial grounds. HR. BAGvALLAY explained the difficulty about this was that it had already been done as a result of a meeting which took place two years ago in Jerusalem and the conclusions of which showed that the cost of reconstruction would be heavy and unlikely to be remunerative. Ibn Saud had been represented at this meeting and he knew all about its conclusions. MR. HALE was of opinion that whilst it would be necessary to answer Ibn Saud’s note it would be most unwise to make a financial offer. HR. DOWITIE asked whether Ibn Saud could not be dissuaded from the Railway project altogether and whether we could not possibly help him with a road. MR. BAGGALLAY said that this suggestion had been made befbre (although not to Ibn Saud) and had much to recommend it. But apparently for sentimental reasons Ibn Saud attached great importance to the railway.Proposal for the provisior of an all- Arab Port.-13- Further discussion ensued as to the financial aspects of the proposal and the general opinion of the Committee was that on these grounds it could not be justified. UR. 3AGGALLAY did not thinly that the proposal for the Kedjaz railway was in a different position fundamentally from many other suggestions which had been made. The question was not whether the project itself was a good one, but whether we were in such a position internationally that we had got to do something in the countries concerned to help or placate them. On this basis he thought that the Ledjaz railway project was as good a way as any other. iHE Ci.jAIzh.AN agreed that tnis was one conceivable way of influencing Saudi Arabia in our favour. There were many difficulties. The chances that the railway, once reconstructed, would pay its way were exceedingly remote; there was every prospect of further demands to meet the cost of upkeep. The Parliamentary difficulties were obvious. Nevertheless, it was one possibility which he considered should be put before the Committee of Imperial Defence. As such it should be included in the Sub committee’s report. r11 ., SUB-C0M1.IITTSE agreed. Proposal for the provision of an all- Arab Port. THE SUB-COIII.IITTEE then discussed a proposal contained in Foreign Office Memorandum (Paper No, M.E.(O) 265) for the provision of an all-Arab Port (i.e. one under Arab sovereignty and joined to the rest of any eventual Arab State by territory under Arab sovereignty) •p -14- The discussion turned first on the question of the most appropriate location for such a port, if it was decided either to create or to make an existing port availahie-j waifa, Jaffa and G-aza were all mentioned in this connection© COLOIikL THORP asked whether we were in a position i/O discuss Jaffa at the moment as the question was still s yfo jua ice and there had been various views put forward to the Tecnnical Commission by the Service Departments© 1HL CHAIRMAN saad that we were not in a position to assume that any particular scheme of partition of Palestine would be adopted; but that did not preclude all reference in the Sub-Committee’s report to the proposal for an all-Arab port© It might suffice to sa.y that, whatever might be the nature of the Palestine settlement, the question of a port was one to which the Arabs in general were likely to attach importance; and ohat it might go some way towards placating them or reconciling them to a settlement which they disliked if their views in this respect could be met. Further than that it seemed hardly possible to go© THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed.-15- Iraq , THE CHAIRMAN drew attention to paragraph 29 of the Foreign Office Memorandum, which raised the question of giving increased facilities for the Iraqi Government at the port of Haifa. The Colonial Office representatives pointed out that this mstter was already in hand. South Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia. Khor-el- Odeid. Yemen. THE SUB-COMMITTEE next considered whether some measure of propitiation could not be achieved by the settlement, on lines favourable to the Arab rulers concerned, of certain outstanding frontier questions. In paragraph 17 of the Foreign Office Memorandum the Foreign Office had suggested that the expenditure of £20,000 or even a larger sum in order to secure the consent of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to the cession to Ibn Saud of the Khor-el-Odeid would be in accordance with the policy of the Committee of Imperial Defence. MR. GIBSON explained that the views of the India Office on this question had just been communicated to the Foreign Office and the correspondence had been circulated to the Departments concerned though not to the Sub-Committee. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that the Report might include a statement to the effect that there were certain boundary questions outstanding between the British Government on the one hand and the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen on the other, in respect of which it might be possible to make concessions to the two rulers concerned; but that, in regard to some of them, it might be necessary to find money for the purpose of compensating our own proteges for the loss of territory which they had hitherto regarded as fully within their jurisdiction.MR. HALE was of opinion that to make concessions to one Arab ruler at the expense of another and then to pay compensation to the latter appeared to be particularly undignified. MR. PEEL said that that point of view had recently found strong support from the Resident in the Persian G-ulf who was of opinion that to pay compensation to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi would be fatal to our prestige all along the Persian Gulf as it would be considered that we had been driven to this action from fear of Ibn Saud. MR. HALE thought that all the arguments in this connection should be put forward for the consideration of Ministers who could not take a decision as to spending money unless they had axl the considerations before them. After further discussion the CHAIRMAN said that the Sub-Committee had been instructed to suggest means of placating certain people. They were not necessarily bound to pronounce judgment upon any particular method or methods. What they had to do was to submit as full a list of suggestions as possible, with an indication of the arguments for and against, for the consideration of higher authority. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed. COLONEL THORP raised the question of influencing the Arab states by giving greater facilities for those States to obtain arms from this country. The general opinion of the Sub-Committee was that this suggestion should be included in the Report and that it would have a good effect on the tribes concerned.17- GROUP CAPTAIN CORYTON referred to the question of an Air Mission to Ibn Saudc This proposal had been discussed with the Foreign Office at an earlier stage and the conclusion reached that it was extremely improbable that the Mission would be successfule This question was one of great difficulty as it was now becoming more difficult to meet demands outside our own air requirements and it would not be possible, at present, to allot the required personnel for the Mission^ Ke explained that the Air Ministry’s view was that the despatch of an Air Mission could not be considered at present 0 THE CHAIRMAN thought that the Air Ministry's view regarding the Air Mission must be accepted* He understood that no applications for arms from Ibn Saud or the other Arab rulers were outstanding at present; but he suggested that the Report should record that an:/ application that Ibn Saud may make for arms etc* should be, as far as possible, sympathetically treated» MR. HALE agreed but pointed out that there were many financial difficulties about the supply of arms to Ibn Saud which had occurred in the past and would occur again. It was difficult for him to pay a price which the Service Departments could take on its merits, and a lower price was bound to be regarded in the nature of a gift, which would raise Parliamentary difficulties. MR. GIBSON mentioned in this connection suggestions which had recently been made for strengthening the local defence resources of Koweit. Bahrein and Muscat* It was in this direction that the Politico! ^^i^ent had suggested that expenditure -could be incurred with most advantage by His Majestylc Government on the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf. The suggestions were dependent on a review of themeasures for the defence of the Persian Gulf in the event cf a major war which had been initiated by the Resident and informally discussed recently with the Departments concerned, and which would, shortly be brought before the Committee of Imperial Defence. It was considered that the matter would be dealt with more appropriately by the Oversea Defence Committee. THE CHAIRMAN summarised the discussion on the measures which could be taken now to influence the minor Powers and Arab States. He proposed that a Report should now be prepared for submission to the Committee of Imperial Defence which should cover the following points (i) Possible assistance to Ibn Saud in the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hedjaz Railway. (ii) The proposal for the provision of an all- Arab port. (iii) Frontier questions at issue with the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. (iv) The supply of arms to Ibn Saud and other Arab States. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed. Meaaures required in the event of War or imminent War. Discussion followed on the measures required in the event of War or imminent War. In this connection the Foreign Office had stated in paragraph 4 of their Memorandum that no definite suggestions could be made without consulting His Majesty's representatives in the countries concerned. It was agreed that this should be done and that the despatch to the Ambassadors concerned should be drafted by the Foreign Office. MR. BAXTER suggested, and the SUB-COMMITTEE agreed, that the despatch might be accompanied by a semi-official or private letter to the Ambassadors concerned, explaining to them how this matter had arisen.9 In discussion as to the countries regarding v/hich the reference was to he made, it was considered that the following countries should he included:- Saudi Arabia; Iraq; Egypt and Sudan; Trans Jordan; Persia; Turkey; and Aden. CONCLUSIONS. THE SUB-COiii.iITTEE agreed:- (a) That with reference to Conclusion (iii) of the Minutes of the 315th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, a re-pqrt. on measures which might he taken before the outbreak of war to influence those minor Powers and Arab States v/hose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war, should be prepared for submission to the Committee of Imperial Defence: the report to cover the following proposals, which might be taken forth v/ith without waiting until war was imminent:- (i) Possible assistance to Ibn Saud in the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian Section of the Hedjaz Railway. (ii) The proposal for the provision of an all-Arab Port. (iii) Frontier questions at issue with the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. (iv) The supply of arms to Ibn Saud and other Arab States. (b) That as a preliminary to reporting to the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Measures required in the event of v/ar or imminent war, to invite the Foreign Office and other Government Departments concerned to obtain the views of His Majesty’s representatives in the following countries Saudi Arabia; Iraq; Egypt and Sudan; Transjordan; Persia; Turkey and Aden,, Whitehall Gardens, 6th May, 1938.

Reference No. CF/l7/35-Wo Sir, Commissioner for Transjordan, Jerusalem. 23rd October, 1935. I have the honour to inform you that, in connection with the present political situation, I have considered what reactions are likely to he felt in Transjordan in the event of a European War, and what measures should he taken to prevent or minimise any local unrest in such circumstanceso 2. I transmit herev/ith a copy of a memorandum prepared hy Major J.B* G-luhh O.B.E, , M„C. , on the subject, which has furnished a valuable basis for discussion of these questions. After consultation with the Air Officer Commanding and the Acting British Resident I have reached the following conclusions:- (i) that if it should become evident at any time that an outbreak of hostilities involving Great Britain was imminent, a sum of LP. 10,000 should be made available to the British Resident for the subsidising of tribal sheikhs; . (ii) that all possible moral support should be given to His Highness the Amir, who should also be accorded, if necessary, financial assistance from the funds referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph; The Right Honourable Malcolm MacDonald, p.C , M.P. ? ate. , His Majesty 1 o rrincipal Secretary of State for the Colonies* -1-t I (iii) (a) that on the actual outbreak of hostilities involving Great Britain, undesirable agitators in Transjordan should be placed in enforced residence in Akaba, under the provision of the Transjordan Prevention of Crime Law; (b) and the one newspaper published in Transjordan should be subsidised financially; (iv) that it is most unlikely that His Majesty’s Government would be willing in the contingency contemplated to make any statement, as suggested by Major Glubb, on the subject of their policy regarding the admission of Jews to Transjordan; (v) that consideration should be given to the possibility of creating interference with broadcasts from hostile stations. Consideration has already been given to the similar problem arising out of Soviet broadcasts, which formed the subject of correspondence ending with the High Commissioner’s despatch Confidential B of the 24th November, 1933, and I anticipate that it would be possible to arrange such interference through the Police wireless system; (vi) that the Officer Commanding, Arab Legion, should work out the details of a scheme to provide a light car patrol along the pipe-line of the Iraq Petroleum Company, in the event of an outbreak of hostilities involving Great Britain. Such a force would consist of about six cars, which could, if necessary, be hired locally, and approximately thirty men. I have, etc. , (Signed) J. Hathorn Hall.

X X X X X KEEPING TRANSJORDAN OUT f Force would certainly de a most undesirable weapon to employ in Transjordan, in order to keep the inhabitants of that country from interference in any disturbances which might occur in Palestine. To begin with, there is probably not enough force in the country to do it, as Imperial Forces stationed in Transjordan are usually called to Palestine when trouble begins. Secondly, the Transjordan Arabs are genuinely friendly to the British, and we to them. To start by shooting them down would be both immoral and unpolitic. Three principal methods seem open to us, in order to keep the Transjordanians from joining in anti-Jewish disturbances. a) Gash gifts and subsidies to Sheikhs. (2) The influence of His Highness the Amir. (3) Prompt action against agitators. (4) A favourable press. ( 5 ) Control of W/T propaganda. GIFTS AND SUBSIDIES. Most of the tribal Sheikhs are open to persuasion, if accompanied by a douceur in cash. Moreover the sums required are trivial? compared to the expenses of a war. In the event of an outbreak of hostilities, however, it would be essential to offer gold. It is impossible to foresee the expenses of warlike operations of any kind,'but I should say that 5 on the outbreak of war 5 a sum of ten thousand pounds in gold should be immediately handed to the British Residents to distribute as necessary. HIS HIGHNESS. The influence exerted by His Highness on the inhabitants of Transjordan is much greater than is often believed by his detractors. Especially is his assistance valuable in the case of disturbances with a semi-religious origin s such as the cry that the Jews and Christians are killing Moslems in Palestine. Every effort should therefore be made to secure the energetic and whole hearted co-operation of His Highness from the start. His Highness ? s sons could probably conveniently visit out- districts 5 or accompany British officers sent to quell disturbances. X X X X X-5- Extract from a secret despatch from the Secretary of State to the Acting High Commissioner for Transjordan dated 18th March, 1936. XX XX I have the honour to refer to your secret despatch of the 23rd October, 1935, regarding the measures which might be adopted in Transjordan in the event of a European war. 2. Major Glubb’s memorandum on this subject has been read with interest and the conclusions reached by you have been noted. 3. After consultation with the Air Council, I have the following comments to offer on the conclusions recorded in paragraph 2 of the despatch:- (i) and (ii). The advisability of being prepared to subsidize the tribal Sheikhs and possibly His Highness the Amir is recognised, but the funds to be made available for this purpose would depend upon the political situation existing at the time and the nature of the emergency to be met. xxx xcopy High Commissioner for Palestine PALESTINE. SECRET. REFERENCE No, t J emsalem, 31st August, 1936. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 33 of the 30th June, 1936, on the subject of the payment of subsidies to Transjordan tribal sheikhs and other influential persons with the object of preventing the spread of the Palestine disorders to Transjordan. 2. So far I have sanctioned the following disbursements by Major Glubb: LP. Haditha el Khewaisha 50 Adhoob Ibn Zebn 50 Dhahir Jbn Dhiyab 50 Turk! el Haidar 25 Miflih Ebn Zebn 25 Minor Beni Sakhr Sheikhs camped near Amman 200 Mohamed Abu Taya 50 Bakhit Ibn Danish 50 Subbat Abu Nuwayir 25 Mitab Ibn Abtan 25 Minor Howeitat Sheikhs west of Ma ! an 200 Sheikhs in pipe line area (Sirhan, Isa, and Jebel Tribes) 150 AdhoJb Ibn Zebn (Beni Sakhr) 20 Audeh Ibn Najad (Howeitat) ^ 20 Subbah Abu Nuwayir (Howeitat) 20 Minor Sheikhs of Beni Sakhr 45 Minor Sheikhs of Howeitat 45 Total LP. 1050 Major Glubb has already distributed LP. 1,000 of this total. 3. The Amir Abdullah has now spent Lp.3,500 in the following manners Payments to Beau 3} oikhs Payments to Notables Agents in Palestine Palestine and Syrian Press Religious personnel in Palestine His Highness’ own additional expenses The Right Honourable W.G.A.

Both the British Resident and Major Glubh are of the opinion that the subsidising of tribal sheikhs is proving efficacious^ and His Highness the Amir also attaches very great importance to this method of keeping the Bedu in hand. As Lieutenant-Colonel Cox observes^ the natural reaction of the Transjordan Arab* v/hether he . is a Beduin sheikh or a village notable, when he is called upon to do something for the Government, or merely to refrain from doing something undesirable, is t o ask for a quid pro quo . The consideration may be money, or the remission of some payment due from him, or the grant of a coveted plot of Government land, or the pardon of a relative sentenced to imprisonment, or the employment of some relation: and of all these possible methods I think that the offer of a present in money is the most suitable for the Amir to adopt. I consider that His Highness* remarkable success in preventing the spread of disorder to Transjordan durlxg the past four months is to be attributed in part to the judicious use which has been made in the disbursement of subsidies. 5o in my telegram under reference I informed you of the allocation of £5,000 out of the total of LP.10,000 9 the expenditure of which was conditionally approved in your telegram No.39 of the 27th June. I propose to continue to allot LP.500 monthly to Major Glubb, subject to the submission of his detailed proposals for my prior approval, and to make further sums available to His Highness the Amir as may appear necessary on the recommendation of the British Resident.

(Paper M.E.(0).261). The Inuia Office wishes to offer the following observations in respect of the Arab Sheikhdoms 01 the Persian Gulf and of Muscat. 2. The importance of these territories to His Majesty’s Government in time of war lies in their situation on the air route to India and in their significance as actual or potential sources for the supply of oil. They are politically backward, and except to some degree in the case of^Koweit the Rulers and their subjects are not sensitive to the currents of Pan-Arab politics; it is significant that they have shown little active interest in the cause of the Palestine Arabs, and, unless there should be a serious weakening of Brixish prestige in the Persian Gulf, they may be expected to acquiesce without demur in whatever decision His Majesty’s Government should reach on the Palestine problem. Their attitude in time of war would similarly depend on the prestige enjoyed in their eyes by Great Britain. Prestige, manifested particularly in the form of naval supremacy, has for over a century been the basis of British influence among the minor Arab States of the Gulf. There has been no system of subsidising the Sheikhs as is follower for example in the Aden Protectorate, ana no sufficient reason is seen for departing from this traditional policy, which has proved economical and has been justified by its results. The point of cardinal importance is the maintenance of British/British prestige ana the avoiaance so Bar as r.iay be possible of any measures that would impair it in the eyes of the Rulers or their subjects. One valuable measure for increasing British influence with the Rulers is the promotion of direct contacts by the exchanges of visits. The recent visit of Princess Alice and Lord Athlone to Bahrein, although only private and incidental to their visit to Saudi Arabia, had an excellent effect with the Sheikh. The Sultan of Muscat has just completed a very successful visit to England as the guest of His Majesty's Government. The Sheikh*of Bahrein and Howe it have also both visited this country in recent years. 5. With regard to the Arab Sheikhdoms, while there seems no occasion for incurring expenditure in tne form of direct * payments to the Rulers at any rate in time of peace, there are certain other ways in which expenditure might profitably be incurred. The Political Resident has recently initiated a review of His Majesty's Government's policy for the defence of the Gulf in the event of a major war. His views have already been informally aiseussed with the Service Departments and it appeared that the defence measures thought desirable in tne protected Arab States would probably not go beyond the raising and equipping of local forces for the prevention of sabotage and for defence against raids from tne intoi ioi . Opportunity was taken Oj. tne uesiuent' s recent deputation to London to consult him on the questions raised by the paper M.E. (0) £61, ana it was ascertained that in his view money would be spent most profitably in the Sheikhdoms of the Gulf by assisting the Rulers in developing the local defence schemes envisaged/envisaged at the informal meeting with the Service Department*. The subject of Gulf defence will be further considered when the Government of India’s viev/s have been received^ It is assumed that expenditure of the hind suggested by the Political Resident would be met from Imperial revenues. T^ere may be other ways in which expend! might be usefully incurred in the near future for the enhancement of British prestige in the Arab Sheikhdoms. Proposals are already under consideration for removing one of the grievances of the Sheikh of Koweit by a monetary payment in discharge of the obligation assumed by His Majesty's Government in 1914 in respect of the exemption from taxation of the Sheikh's date gardens in Iraq. Suggestions have also been made for increasing British influence on the Trucial Coast, e. g. by the appointment of a medical officer, but the Government of India have so far been unable to provide the necessary funciG * lf the Proposals which they have made for the luture incidence between Imperial and Indian revenues of diplomatic and consular expenditure in the Gulf are accepted, fresh expenditure of this kind would fall upon His Majesty's Government and it may be that the Middle (Official) Sub-Commifctee would wish to express an opinion on the desirability of such expenditure in the event of the Government of India’s proposals being dopted. It is possible of course that in the event of war oome systen ox direct payments, particularly to the Trucial Sheikhs, may be found necessary for the maintenance of settled conditions along the air route, ^ is feltmnecessary to consider this in advance.4 -C m 5. It is rioted that reference is made in the memoranda prepared by the Foreign Office and War Office to the suggestion for the cession of the Khor al Odeid as a means of securing Ibn Saud T s agreement to a settlement of the frontier of South-Eastern Saudi Arabia. The views of the Secretary of State for India on this suggestion are being circulated; in brief he considers that if the cession coulu be arranged at all it could only be secured by means that would seriously impair British prestige on the Trucial Coast and in the whole of the Arab Sheikhdoms. The Sub-Committee might wish to consider whether the funds which it is suggested might be made available for this purpose would not be spent with less injury to His Majesty's Government's interests in the form of direct assistance in arms etc. to Ibn Saud. 6. Muscat is in a different position from the Sheikhdoms by reason of its independent status.' It is clear that any definite advantages would be derived from any form of financial assistance that could be given to the Sultan. He has raised with the Government of India the question of renewing the 'Arms Traffic Subsidy' of Es.l lakh which was paid to the Ruling Sultans from 1911 to 1935, and the possibility has been suggested of utilising- a renewal of thf-^ subsidy to secure some form of political control in Muscat. The Government of India consider that renewal would not be justified by any reasons connected with the arms traffic, and if His Majesty's Government were to think that the subsidy should be renewed in return for political advantages the Government of India consider that the liability should fall on Imperial revenues. It is however doubtful/5* doubtful if the Sultan could in tnis way be crouynt more definitely unaer British influence. He is extremely sensitive on the matter of his inaependent status, and it is quite probable that rather than impair it he would prefer to remain without the subsidy. may be possible to give him some form of assi regard to local defence schemes. But he is conscious of his dependence on Great Britain protection in the case of trouble from within his State to bo Y. r 0 ll — bisposed to His Iviajestj 1 in the event of war without the incentive 02 stance in sufficiently for or without s Government finaneial inducements. 7. The above observations must be regarded as provisional ann subject to the views of the Government of India and the further views of the Political Resident which will be called for if the Sub-Committee so desires.Date.

M, E 0 ( 0 ) 261 0 The Air Ministry desire to make the followifig observations on the questions referred to in M,E.(0) 261, paragraph 2 (iii) and (xiii) 0 It is understood that when the recommendation made at conclusion (iii) of ChChS., Paper No. 691 was formulated the Chiefs of Staff primarily had in mind that H. M. representa tives should be given the necessary authority in peace to dirhurse funds, on a large scale if necessary, to highly placed officials of the States concerned immediately before or on the outbreak of war, 3. In addition to this measure it may be expedient to consider other measures under two headings (i) Measures to be taken in peace. (ii) Measures to be taken on the outbreak of war. 4. With regard to (i) the following appear to be suitable means towards the establishment and maintenance of cordial relations during peace (a) The provision, when practicable, of military and/or air equipment and training facilities for those minor Powers or Arab States who desire such assistance, for example, Saudi-Arabia, (b) The grant of long rerm loans to facilitate (a) above if required. (cy The prevision ol me a ;s whereby better cultural and educational facilities may be introduced for exa:\.p_. so cools, public works, reads, telegraph or W/T communication etc. (d) Measures to reserve the services of suitable officials wao could be sent out as political or military advisers in time of war* -1 -V r \\ mu-** 5. As regards (ii) v/e should be x^reoared:- (a) To make considerable subsidies to local govermnents to counter enemy offers of financial assistance as and when required. (b) To despatch the officers referred to at paragraph 4(d) above. (c) To take such steps as are within our power to safeguard the territory of these Arab States from enemy aggression. 6. l/ith reference to conclusion (xiii) the Air Ministry would welcome the establishment of such a route for the conveyance of personnel and heavy stores to Egypt as an alternative to the route via Basra and Iraq, in the event of the Red Sea being closed to us. 7. At the sane time they doubt if the construction and maintenance of an all-weather road adequate for this purpose, and more especially to meet military requirements - particularly through the area lying between Soroti and Malakal or Kosti - is practicable, except at prohibitive cost. In any event it would appear to be essential to arrange for a detailed reconnaissance of the country through Y/hich this route would pass before even an approximate estimate of the cost can be obtained. 8. j-.s pointed out in the final sub-paragraph of paragraph, 1^9 oi C.O.S. Paper Fo. 691, the whole of this route would lie within range of a limited scale of air attack from Italian East Africa and, in this connection, the Air Ministry desires to soress the fact that the suggested southern terminal - Mombasa — oners an easily located and vulnerable target to air attack within comparatively short range of Italian air forces based at Kismayu or other points in Southern Italian Somaliland. Y/hile the lack of facilities for unloading aircrait, bulky ancillary stores and military equipment at L -2--3- Mombasa can doubtless be overcome after considerable expenditure of time and money, such facilities could be considerably disorganized by a light scale of air attack. To meet this danger however the first reinforcements for despatch by this route would include air defence units. 9. Under the existing mandate our possession of Tanganyika is not permanent. The Air Ministry feel therefore that in spite of the fact that both Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam are at considerably greater distances from Italian air bases than Mombasa these two ports cannot be considered as alternatives to Mombasa. 10. As regards the air route, improvements have alreadjf been effected or are in the process of being carried out at certain intermediate landing grounds (for example Malakal and Juba) between Khartoum and Nairobi, and tentative steps have been taken to acquire land at mort Reitz, in the immediate vicinity of Mombasa, to provide an aerodrome of adequate size. On completion of this aerodrome it should be possible to despatch a restricted number of R.A.F. flying units by air over this route at any season of the year. The introduction of modern types of aircraft will facilitate the passage by air of reinforcing squadrons to Egypt by this route, but the problem of re-provisioning with bulky stores and war materials, etc. still remains.l™-f_®°^“™_^L™_ PR0PERTY 0P HIS BR ITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT. ) S. ” C R E T.

It is understood from the Colonial Office that a road report on the section Soroti to Juba is on its way from Kenya by air mail. 3. The route is divided into the following sections:- (a) Kalindini - Soroti, 600 miles 3.3. gauge single track railway. (b) Soroti — Juba, 280 miles of all weather motor track. (c) Juba - Kosti, 800 miles river. (d) Kosti - Wadi Haifa, 800 miles rail. (e) Wadi Haifa - Shellal, 230 miles river. (f) Shellal - Cairo, 556 miles Egyptian State Railways. 4. The War Office are therefore of the opinion that while a reconnaissance may eventually be necessary, it would be best to postpone consideration of this question until the reports mentioned above have been received, when the matter can be discussed in fuller detail* The War Office, 27th April, 1938(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT.)

(e) What measures can be taken in peace to improve relations with Great Britain. (f) What further measures can be taken on the outbreak of war. w: - Lnor ^ w ers concerned are Egypt, Saudi Iraq, Yemen and Iran. The Arab States comprise, Kuscat&gt; Koweit, the Trucial Shaikhdoms and the local rulers in tho Aden Protectorate. Wo must also consider Palestine, Trans jordan and the Sudan, though those are in effect controllod by Great Britain already, and the question of Syria and too Lebanon will also have to be discussed owing to their proximity to our important interests in Palestine, Trans- Jordan and Iraq. These Stat&amp;s may be again divided into those which are in varying degrees unlor our control, and those which arc independent of us. i a tholatter category we can place the Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, and the Lebanon® The former category comprises all the remainder, and in these States it is of great importance irrespective of the degree of control which we exercise over their rulers, to ensure the goodwill of the peoples themselves, since the degree of actual control exercised by the nominal rulers is far less than in more civilised countries® 3. Ignoring the complications arising from Palestine, to which reference is made below, the countries listed above fall into four groups in respect of their present relations with Great Britain!— (u) Sgyp c a nd Iraq. , whose relations with theory, all outstanding differences are either settled or in a fair way to settlement® In fact, however, causes of friction exist in Doth cases, and are liable to come into play over questions of the maintenance of essential British interests® While motives of self- protection are at present strong enough to prevent either country seriously opposing British interests, the force of these motives tends gradually to diminish; this is particularly the case in Iraq where suspicions of British intentions, combined with consistently unstable internal political conditions, make her attitude unreliable®('b) Saudi-Arabia, Yemen and Iran? whose relations with us may be described as ’•correct', and who are sufficiently impressed with British prestige not to allow their several outstanding claims of a territorial nature against Great Britain seriously to affect their attitude under present conditions® (c) The Sudan, Transjordan, Aden Protectorate; Koweit, the Trucial Shaikhdo ms and Muscat , territories whose relations with us are governed by treaty or who are under British control or , influence, and which have no outstanding problems likely to cause a major change in their present satisfactory attitude j so long as British power and presltge remain unimpaired® (d) Syri a and Lebanon?, whose official relations with Great Britain are at present governed by relations between Great Britain and Prance, but where in view of the impending termination of the French Mandate, the goodwill of the people will become a factor of considerable importance in the future* (e) Palestine , whose relations with Great Britain could scarcely be worse and where the existing conditions are affecting to an increasing extent the attitude of many of the other countries mentioned above®4. British interests affected. -4- The principal British interests likely to be affected in war and the countries most directly concerned in each case aret- (a) Suez Canal . Egypt and Palestine. (b) Overland routes from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. (i) Basra-Baghiod-Haifa . Iraq, Saudi-Arabia, Transjordan and Palestine; and indirectly Koweit, Iran, Syria and the Lebanon. (ii) Koweit -Aq aba-Suez. Koweit, s Saudi-Arabia, Palestine; and indirectly Iraq and Transjordan. (c) Ojj. supplies . ( i) Anglo-Iranian Oilfields . Ir-an and Iraq. (ii) Iraq-Haifa Pipe-line . Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine; and indirectly Syria and Lebanon. (iii) Bahrein and other North-Arabian Fields. Trucial Shaikhdoms and Saudi-Arab!a. (d) A i r routes . (i) North-Arabian route . Muscat, Trucial Shaikhdoms, Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine. (ii) South-Arabian route . Muscat, the Aden Protectorate. (e) Aden. The Yemen and the Aden Protectorate.-5- (f) Air Base at Dhi'b'ban . Iraq. (g) General position in Iraq . Iraq and indirectly Iran. ( h) Overland route Mombasa-Sudan-Egypt . The Sudan and Egypt. 5. All these territories are permeated by an intense spirit of nationalism, the placation of which it is essential to include in any measures undertaken to bind their interests to those of Great Britain. They are all, with the possible exception of Iran, connected racially and linguistically and the predominating religion is Islam. Measures taken in one country are therefore likely to react on the others. This suggests that certain measures of a general nature should be applied in addition to those particularly applicable to individual States. Suspicion of western nations in general is rife and requires circumspection in the methods of approach. A pronounced characteristic is the tendency to 'sit on the fence' in the first instance even in situations involving their own friends, and to waste time in fruitless discussion before deciding on action. In many of the States* the personality of the British representative is still a big factor in determining the attitude of the rulers. Personal rivalries and intrigue play a big part in their politics and offers scope for influencing the rulers. Money is an even more potent weapon than is the case elsewhere. 6. Measures designed to strengthen the6 A \1 U it) OWt. friendly attitude of these countries which can he taken before the outbreak of war fall into four categories:- (a) Early settlement of outstanding political and territorial questions between them and Great Britain or between themselves. (b) Propaganda and other expedients to strengthen British prestige and influence and to counteract anti-British influences. (c) Strengthening of economic ties with Great Britain by development of trade, assistance in economic, cultural and social development, to induce a greater dependence on the British connection. (d) Encouragement of the use of British war material to induce dependence on us for maintenance in war. With regard to (a) the earlier the outstanding problems are settled and above all that of Palestine, the better will relations become. The longer some decision in Palestine is deferred, the greater the chances of Arab hostility in emergency and the more lee-way we shall have to make up in rebuilding our friendship with these countries. Unpalatable settlements made without delay would be preferable to leaving open opportunities for friction, which may even become weapons of blackmail in critical times. If unpalatable decisions are inevitable, as seems certain in some cases, the sooner they are in force the sooner will the immediate unfavourable reaction U it ) ©vtfcdie down. This applies particularly to the frontier disputes with Saudi-Arabia and the Yemen. Political settlement seems to be the primary measure to be taken in peace time; without it, the remaining proposals given above are likely to cause suspicion and so defeat their own object. The aim of ( c) and ( d) above should be to produce such an interlocking of economic interests in peace as will ensure benevolent neutrality in war by a judicious mixture of economic pressure and the payment of subsidies. 7. As regards measures to be taken on the outbreak of war, these must largely depend on the situation at the time, including the attitude then existing and our own particular necessities. If measures ( c) and ( d) above have been effectively implemented in peace there will be a good basic on which to build. Further measures might then include - (a) An intensification of propaganda particularly by broadcasting news in such a way as to enhance respect for British arms and ach i e veme nt s. (b) The payment of subsidies. (c) Free provision of warlike stores including arms and ammunition where required for the expansion of forces for local defence or for participation as allies of Great Britain. As in the past, the personal factor in local British representatives and the effectiveness of British propaganda on the outbreak of war will decide the issue in some cases. The characteristic -7-of H sitting on the fence’' already referred to should give us time to appreciate the situation and ‘cUzz- the measures necessary to meet it in countries whose attitude is doubtful. As matters stand at present the attitude of Ibn Saud is likely to govern that of other Arab countries and his attitude in the immediate future will be largely governed by a generous settlement of the boundary / dispute and by our ultimate policy in Palestine, To sum up, the following measures are recommended in peace s~ (i) Early settlement on generous terms of political and territorial disputes now outstanding, particularly the Palestine problem and the frontier dispute v/ith Ibn Saud. (ii) Increase economic penetration. (iii) Improvement of British influence by propaganda. and on the outbreak of war s- (i) Intensification of propaganda. (ii) The payment of subsidies. (iii) Free provision of warlike stores. The War Office, 27th April, 1938.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY f S GOVERNMENT)• L SECRET . COPY NO. I I M.E. (0) 59th Mt£.

The attached memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office with reference to Paper No. M.E.(0)261, Conclusion iii, is circulated and will he for consider ation at the next meeting of the Suh-Committee to he held on Friday, 6th May, 1S38. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 29th April, 1938.MEASURES WHICH MIGHT IIIELUENCE THOSE MINOR POWERS AND ARAB STA TES W HOSE ASSISTANCE OR BENEVOLENT NEUTRALITY MIGHT BE OF VALUE TO HIS MAJESTY 1 'S GOVERNMENT IN TIME OF WAR, It is assumed for the purpose of the present Memorandum that in view of the terms of paragraph 259 of the Appreciation hy the Chiefs of staff which was hefore the 515th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, recommendation (iii), that - 'the Middle East (Official) Suh-Committee should investigate and report on the measures which might he taken, either hefore or on the outbreak of war, to influence those Minor Powers and Arah States whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war' refers mainly to financial measures, that a war with Italy is primarily envisaged and that the extent of the financial assistance to be given must be commensurate with whatever is required to achieve the objects in view. It is difficult to act upon this recommendation unless it is also assumed that the hostilities for which precautions are to be taken would find the Governments now in power in one various Middle Eastern countries, their hold upon those countries and their attitude towards His Majesty* s Government, the same as they are to-day, especially in the matter of Palestine, in regard to which the Arab States, while fearing the worst, are still hoping for the best, in other words, that the supposed war is coming almost at oncec 3. Tne action eventually taken in Palestine as the-2- result of the report of the Palestine Technical Commission may, hov/ever, change the whole basis upon which these measures have to he taken - possibly for the better, if the action is acceptable to the Arab States, or, even if unacceptable, is nevertheless regarded with resignation; possibly,- if the action is unacceptable and leads to increased hostility on the part of their Govern ments or peoples, for the worse. It is to be feared, how ever, that if the change were for the worse, no expenditure of money, however lavish, could be relied upon infallibly to placate the Arab Governments or peoples concerned or to prevent them from supporting our enemies* 4 # No definite suggestions as to the measures required in the event of war or imminent war can be made without consulting His Majesty’s Representatives in the countries concerned and it will be easier to frame enquiries to His Majesty’s Representatives after an exchange of ideas in the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee. In particular it will be desirable to know whether in the event of imminent hostilities His Majesty’s Government would take powers to employ public funds abroad in any manner which seemed best to them without further Parliament ary sanction being necessary. In the meanwhile the following observations may assist the discussion in the Sub-Committee 0 5. It is difficult to lay down positively an order of importance for the countries of the Middle East to which the recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence might apply. But subject to the proviso made in-3- /^\ paragraph 2 the order of importance of these countries for the purpose of the present enquiry is probably as follows: Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, The Yemen, Persia. 6. Turkey is placed first because she now forms the main, if not the only, obstacle to German penetration towards the Middle East and her friendship is a vital strategical necessity to this country, more especially in view of the difficulties arising out of the Palestine situation. Persia is placed last because so long as the Soviet Union is not in a position to embark upon adventures outside its own territories Persia is the Middle Eastern country least exposed to foreign influence and intrigue, and also the most remote from the Mediterranean and Red Sea areas which would inevitably be the scene of an Anglo-Italian conflict; but it must be remembered that Persia could seriously embarrass this country in time of war by interference with the Anglo- Iranian oil fields. The order of importance as between Iraq and Saudi Arabia is somewhat difficult to assess. The fact that the air communications of the British Empire pass through Iraq suggests that Iraq should take priority. On the other hand, the prestige of Ibn Saud is so great that his hostility would probably affect large numbers of Arabs and other Moslems outside his own territory. 7. The possibility and necessity of securing the assistance or benevolent neutrality of these states by financial measures might be summarised as in the following Table A, which must be understood to consist of generalisations only, subject to the limitations inherent4 - in all generalisations:- A. War or Imminent War with Italy* (May 1938). ^ (1) Governments. (a) No need and prodatily no way to ,, 'buy” the Turkish Government. Great need to help them. (h) Perhaps a way hut probably no need to 'buy' the Iraqi Government. Some need to help them. (c) No way and no need to ,, buy ,, Ibn Saud. Great need to help him. (d) Great need and perhaps a way to 'buy' the Imam Yahya. Some need to help him. (e) Perhaps a way but probably no need to 'buy' the Persian Government. No need to help them. (2) Other elements and the press, (a) Can be ignored while the Turkish Government maintain their present hold. (b) Doubtless a v/ay to 'buy' various Iraqi political elements and the press and some need to do so. (c) Doubtless a way to 'buy' various Saudi- Arabian elements, tribal and otherwise, which are opx^osed to the Palestine policy of* His Majesty’s Government and so might side with Italy, but no need to do so if adequate help can be given to Ibn Saud. Press unimportant.(d) Doubtless a way to '‘buy' the pro-Italian elements in the Yemen and some need to do so, even if the Imam Yahya is also ,, ■bought ,, . Press unimportant. (e) Can he ignored while the Persian Government maintain their present hold. 8. But the action to he taken when war is imminent will depend to a great extent on the action already taken during times of peace. It is not clear whether the phrase 'before .... the outbreak of war' includes action which may he taken now without waiting until war is imminent, hut in any case a wise use of the financial resources of this country at the present time may serve an equally useful purpose with the expenditure of even larger sums when war is imminent or has broken out. 9o The following Yable B is therefore given showing the forms of financial aid, some of them already under consideration, which might he desirable or possible at the present time even though no war seems imminent:- B 1 JTo^mmjal^t JVar ;- (May 1938) (1) Governments. (a) Help necessary for Turkey in the form of Indusorial credits and a loan or credits for armaments.-6- M (c) (^) (e) No special help or 'bribery' necessary for the Iraqi Government, so long as their arms purchases can he met reasonably promptly. Help necessary for Ibn Saud in some or all of the following matters: The Hejaz railway. The South-Eastern Frontiers* Rifles, machine guns, etc. An Air Mission and aircraft. 'Bribing' the Imam Yahya might be useful, but no concrete suggestions are possible without con sultation with the Aden authorities. No special help or 'bribery' necessary in the case of the Persian Government. (^) Ot her El eme nts and Press. No special action is desirable in normal times beyond what is already done in regard to the subsidising of certain news agencies. lO. The question of financial assistance for Turkey in the form of credits enabling her to buy industrial equipment or armaments (especially warships) is already engaging the close attention of various Departments of His Majesty’s Government,and it is hoped that ways and means may be found for granting an industrial credit of at least £3,000,000 and perhaps £10,000,000 through the agency of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, and in addition a credit of some £6,000,000, for which a special Act of Parliament may be required, to facilitate the purchase of warships.-7- 11 A special Act of Parliament for the purchase of war ships may give rise to considerable difficulty, both Parliamentary and otherwise, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed that the reasons which have been given by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for finding a way to give Turkey these credits are of overwhelming importance, and that some means must be devised if in any way possible of giving effect to the policy which Lord Halifax has recommendedo 12. For the purposes of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee, therefore, the question of the Turkish credits may be noted, but need not be considered further for the momento 13. Iraq has recently raised a loan for railway develop ment etc. with at least the moral backing of His Majesty’s Government and she is now seeking credits for the purchase of railway material from the Export Credits Guarantee Department. It is desirable on general grounds that these credits should be granted, if commercially justified; but Iraq’s finances are upon the whole very sound, while she draws large sums by way of oil royalties outside the range of her ordinary expenditure. There is therefore for the moment no particular need to assist Iraq financially. 14. The question of financial assistance for Saudi Arabia has recently been raised in two forms (a) possible assistance in the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hejaz Railway. (b) (indirectly) possible compensation for the Sheikh of Abu D habi for the surrender to Saudi Arabia of the area adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid.-8— 15o The question of assistance in regard to the Hejaz Railway has 'been dealt with in Foreign Office letter Ee1237/1237/25 of 1st April, 1938, to the Treasury and the Colonial Office, copies of which were circulated at the time to all Departments represented on the Middle East Sub committee, and in Colonial Office letter 79086/38 of 11th April to the Foreign Office, copies of which have been similarly circulated to the interested Departments* A further letter from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office commenting upon the letter of 18th April is being circulated separately 0 16- The Foreign Office wish to stress the point that in recommending that financial assistance should be offered to Saudi Arabia in regard to this railway, they are well aware that even if the original estimated cost of £190,000 were correct the difficulties in the way of raising this whole sum might be found to be insuperable and that even if the sum could be raised and the railway rebuilt, the rail way’s utility would be extremely doubtful. But the point to which they attach importance is that a gesture should be made by showing Ibn Baud as soon as possible that His Majesty’s Government, while unable to conceal their belief that the reconstruction of the railway is unlikely to be attended by useful results, are nevertheless sympathetic in principle towards a project in which the Moslem world is keenly interested* They therefore hope that the Committee will agree that an offer of £30,000 or even of a much larger sum would be in accordance with the policy advocated by the Committee of Imperial Defence. 17o The question of compensation for the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi cannot be decided unless a decision is first taken with regard to the whole question of the south-eastern, frontiers of Saudi Arabia* The Foreign Office hope soon to be in a position to make further recommendations with regard to the disposal of the area adjoining the Khor-el- Odeid and for the moment they would only ask that, assuming for the sake of argument that it is eventually decided that the consent of the Sheikh to the surrender of part of his territory should by some means or other be secured, the expenditure of £20,000 or even a larger sum in order to secure this consent would be in accordance with the policy of the Committee of Imperial Defence* 18o There remains the Question of more direct assistance to Ibn Saud, in regard especially to the equipment of his armed forces. There is reason to hope that as a result of the finding of oil in Hasa his financial difficulties may from now onwards be somewhat less acute* But even if he receives substantial royalties from this source, there can oe no question bub tnat the sale of arms at reduced prices or alternatively on long credits, would greatly assist him to consolidate his position and so enable him to withstand the more readily one pressure which is being brought to bear upon him as tne result of tne policy of His Majesty* s Govern ment with regard to Palestine* 19© .lIig arms which would be of most use to him are probably those of a relatively simple kind, such as rifles, field-guns, machine-guns, and ammunition for these weapons and it is possible that the expenditure of some such sum as £50,000 in assisting him to purchase such weapons would be well expended, 20© ibn Saud’s own ambitions, however, point in the direction of aircraft, in spite of the fact that he &gt;has no pilots or ground personnel capable of flying and main.taining10- modern machines. These difficulties have already been closely examined by the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office and the view has hitherto been taken that unless he could be supplied at the coot of His Majesty’s Government with a small Mission capable of training his pilots and maintaining for him his aircraft and repair shops, the gift of aircraft alone would be of little use 0 The view has, moreover, been taken by His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda that as an Air Mission would almost inevitably fail even after a long period to produce capable pilots, given the unsatisfactory material upon which it would have to work, no Mission could hope in the end to succeed in improving Anglo-Saudi relations. 21* notwithstanding these difficulties, some of which might not become apparent until the dangerous period immediately ahead had been passed, there is much to be said for reviewing the question of providing an Air Mission, together with a small gift of aircraft. The cost of such a policy was estimated some months ago at from £27,850 to £33,4-00 as an ini cial outlay for the provision of training a:lr..;ratt ? together with spares and incidentals, with a father recurrent expenditure of from £11,000 to £13,000 in respect of the above, as well as a minimum annual expenditure oi £6,000 for a small service mission© There is, however, one difficulty connected with the appointment of an Air Mission which has only recently arisen a ' ld that is the inclusion of the Anglo-Italian .Agreement aha; .Arabia, It is true that nothing in this Agreement expressly rules out the appointment of a Mission and in actual fact a small Italian Air Mission has been employed at Jedda m recent years, notwithstanding the provisions of the confidential Rome Understanding of 1927. nevertheless.-11- having regard to the atmosphere created 'oy the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian settlement and in particular the provisions of the Anl/£o-Italian Agreement about Arabia (which is a valuable instrument from the point of view of His Majesty's Government) it would probably be necessary to secure at least the acquiescence of the Italian Govern ment in any British Mission, more especially as the reason professed by Ibn Saud for desiring a British Mission is his desire to get rid of the Italian Mission® 23 0 It is doubtful whether there is at the moment any practical manner in which His Majesty's Government can assist the Yemen financially, especially as the Imam is, compared with Ibn Saud, well supplied with financial resourceso It might, however, be desirable to ask the Governor of Aden whether in his opinion there is any way in whoc h the Imam can usefully be assisted. There is furthermore the possibility that his goodwill might be secured, not by financial expenditure, but by territorial concessions e 0 go a'u Shabwa or in the Seiar country® 24 e Persia, is at the moment in a very difficult economic position, mainly because her ambitious programme of industrial development, railway construction and armament purchases has drained the country of all its available resources, notwithstanding the large sums drawn annually oy way of royalties from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company® The result is a great shortage of foreign exchange and. for this and other reasons, a great reduction in the volume of United Kingdom exports to Persia. This being so, the most useful way in which money could he spent in regard to Persia would probably be found to be the granting of credits for the purchase of material such as machinary, etc.-12- @) in this country which Persia could not huy here on ordinary credit terras, even with the assistance of the Export Credits Guarantee Department* 25. But although the Board of Trade could, if tne Committee thought this desirable, be consulted as to possible ways of granting credits, the Foreign Office do not consider that such credits are necessary on political grounds. It will be remembered that the Persian Government have in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company not only a steady source of revenue, but also a 'banker' who has been willing on occasion to accommodate her with advances on future royalties enabling them to tide over the worst moments in their xoreign exchange position. 26. In addition to the foregoing proposals, there is one further proposal which, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, may prove of great importance. It concerns primarily the mandated territory of Palestine and not any particular independent Middle Eastern country. This proposal is one fbr the provision of 'an all-Arab port'. 27. The illustrative scheme of partition embodied in the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine gave Jaffa to the proposed Arab State in full sovereignty, but at the same time interposed between Jaffa and the remainder of the Arab State a stretch of territory under British mandate. fhe recommen- dations which the Palestine Technical Commission may make in regard to this question cannot now be foreseen, but the Foreign Office feel that it is most important, not merely on practical grounds, but having regard to tne psychological effect on the Arab peoples outside Palestine, that if partition is eventually adopted and enforced, the Arab State should at least be provided with a first-class portunder exclusive Arab sovereignty and that this port should be joined to the remainder of the Arab State by territory under the continuous sovereignty of that State. It is known that the Arabs, or at least the Moslem Arabs, fool that with Beirut and Haifa and now Alexandretta in non-Moslem Arab hands, their access to the Mediterranean Is being throttled and they fear that if the Jewish State succeeds in securing, if not Jaffa itself, at least a belt of territory surrounding Jaffa, and possibly Gaza as well, they will be cut off from the Mediterranean altogether. 28. If therefore it is impossible for any reason to give Jaffa to the Arab State on these terms, the Foreign Off ice suggest that the possibility of developing Gaza as a first- class port for this purpose should be consideredo There may be no economic necessity for a third large port on the Palestine coast and the cost of development may well be heavy. But, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, as Majesty 1 s Government should consider bearing the cost of developing either Gaza or some other port as ”an all-Arab port', as a measure of appeasement which, should the policy of partition be enforced, may prove of substantial value. 29. It has also been suggested that His Majesty*s Government might induce the Iraqi Government to withdraw their opposition to the proposed partition of Palestine by giving them increased port facilities on the Palestine coast. It is most unlikely that this alone would be a sufficient 'bribe', but the suggestion may nevertheless be worth investigating for its own sake.

In accordance with the policy for the co-ordination of plans approved 'by the Chiefs of Staff in connection with preceding appreciations ? i.e„ ? 'Planning for War with Germany' (Paper No. CoO^S. 549) and the 'Far East Appreciation*' (Paper No. C.O.S, 590), we recommend that plans should now he prepared on certain aspects of the situation in Mediterranean, Middle East and North East Africa and should, similarly, he communicated in due course to the Joint Planning Suh-Committee. These plans would include;- (i) Naval Mediterranean War Plan, including plans for offensive operations (an Admiralty Memorandum now in course of preparation); (ii) Plans for the movement of initial reinforcements; (iii) Suez Canal Defence Plan (when revised edition is complete); (iv) Such other plans as may devolve from the recommendations which follow. Additional recomm end ations and pla ns. 258. The following additional recommendations and plans are exclusive of the various measures which have recently been approved hy the Committee of Imperial Defence for improving our general defensive position in the Eastern Mediterranean. Moreover, we have not included certain other questions, relevant to this appreciation, which are referred to in separate papers and are now under active consideration hy the Department or Departments concerned.In the above category are included the measures proposed in the Combined Defence Plan for the Defence of Egypt* recently submitted by the three local commanders in the Eastern Mediterranean (e.g** the provision of defences at Alexandria* coast defences in Mersa Matruh* the provision of anti-gas equipment for Egyptian civil population, the fomation of an Egyptian Navy, the relief of the infantry company in Cyprus on the outbreak of war, the use of civil aircraft, etc#).m V -7- (b) Reference conclusion (iii) a Politicale 259. O • O Q O o O (iii) Since, in the financial and economic sphere our resources are far greater than those of our potential enemies, we should not hesitate to exploit this advantage to the utmost upon the outbreak of war in an endeavour to influence those Minor Powers and Arab States v/hose assistance or even benevolent neutrality would mean so much to us e All of them are particularly susceptible to offers of financial assistance, and timely expenditure on a scale adequate to ensure their co-operation might ultimately save us far greater expenditure. If, however, such negotiations are to be successful it is essential that plans should be prepared which can be implemented without delay on the outbreak of war, and we recommend that the necessary action should now be taken by the appropriate body to investigate this question, e.g. the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee. (c) Reference conclusion (xiii) . Route via Mombasa. 128. At the present time it would be inpracticable to make reinforcements by this route. It would involve transportation over 600 miles of single track 3.3-gauge railway to Soroti. Prom Soroti a fine weather motor track runs for 180 miles over high, stony, bare country to the Nile on the Sudan frontier; but the Nile is not navigable at this point. Before it can be decided. whether this route could -in the future he the movement of troops, the whole route would have to he reconnoitred and the possibility of collecting suitable transport investigated. No plans can he based on the use of this route at present, hut there would he every advantage in developing it. There is an air route from Mombasa to Egypt at the present time, hut it is unsuitable for short-range aircraft, such as we anticipate having to send with our Bomber squadrons in April 1938. Moreover, the port facilities at Mombasa and Dar-es-Salaam are not designed to deal with the disembarkation of aircraft from ships and their erection in large numbers on shore. Conclusioiic 129. We conclude that the scale of air attack upon convoys through the Red Sea is most unlikely to be so intensive, even initially, as that upon convoys through the Mediterranean, and that at equal speeds of advance the Red Sea convoy might only be in danger of sustained attack for less than half as long as it would in the Mediterranean. The risks to an 8-knot convoy in the Mediterranean would be very much greater than to an 18-knot convoy, and, in the absence of war experience of air attack and A.A. defence on a large scale, to attempt the passage of such a slow convoy through the Mediterranean could not be considered justifiable unless it was the only way to save Egypt, and steps should be taken to avoid its necessity. If Italy decided that war with Great Britain was inevitable, she could undoubtedly do much in time of peace to improve her facilities for air attack against shipping in the Red Sea. Even so, the Italian effort —8—from East Africa will decrease with the rjassage of time as her resources 'become exhausted* With regard to the land routes: that via Mombasa to the Sudan v/ill not 'be practicable in 1938, 'but the eventual development would have the advantage of being an H All-Red’' route and involve no new commitment as far as defence against land attack is concerned. On the other hand, it will be vulnerable throughout almost its entire length to attack from Italian air forces situated in Italian East Africa. The route via Iraq, and Palestine from Basra can be used given preliminary organisation, but has the disadvantage that internal security consideration may necessitate the use of troops to maintain our line of communications. On the other hand, Italian air attack is an unlikely contingency. m » K 144. As regards Air Forces, maintenance units at present exist in Egypt, Iraq, and Indian Of these, \ Aboukir, in Egypt, is within range of Italian air attack and it is, therefore, undesirable that we should rely upon it, otherwise than as an advance base. Dhibban is next in distance from our operations and its value will depend upon the situation in Iraq. Karachi is too far from our operations to be of practical value as a base depot for Egypt. It is clear, therefore, that Dhibban would be of considerable value to us, especially in the initial stages, and, on the assumption that the Iraqi Government is friendly, its security should not involve us in any large military commitment. In a war of this nature it is essential to develop a main air base for aircraft supply in the neighbourhood% If '-'f of good port facilities such as exist at Basra or could he developed at Mornhasa or Dar—es—Salaarn* Local examination at these places appears to indicate that Basra already meets our requirements, and the air and land routes from there to Egypt are more fully developed tiian those from Mombasa or Dar-es-Salaam # A further consideration is that although the overland route from Mombasa is reasonably secure from land attack, the greater portion of it passes within range of Italian air attack from Abyssinia or Libya, v/hereas the route from Basra to Egypt would only be liable to attack from Palestine onwards. Nevertheless, we are dependent on the goodwill of the Iraqi Government for the use of air facilities and communications in Iraq, and we must, therefore, be prepared to develop Mombasa and the overland route from there to Egypt as an alternative. i - 10 - A s+ Jr V;</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001d1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3896A</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001d1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3896A</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/160(S) 'C.I.D.

The Sub-Committee had been charged by the Committee of Imperial Defence to 'investigate and report on the measures which might be taken, either before or on the outbreak of war, to influence those Minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war' (folio 77). The work of the Sub-Committee focussed on Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, the Yemen, and the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, and the papers contain reports and discussions of British policy in relation to all those countries.The papers contain memoranda drawn up by the Foreign Office, the India Office, the War Office, and other British Government departments, and by British representatives in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Aden, etc. for submission to the Sub-Committee; agenda and minutes of meetings of the Sub-Committee; reports of the Sub-Committee; and India Office minutes.The Arab shaikhdoms of the Persian Gulf and Muscat were said by the India Office to be of importance to the British Government because of their situation on the air route to India, and in their significance as actual and potential sources for the supply of oil (folio 285); folio 327, folios 285-289, folio 98, and folios 4-44 relate particularly to the Persian Gulf.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
