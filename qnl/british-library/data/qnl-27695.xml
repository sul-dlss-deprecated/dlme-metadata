(302/5/49) BAHRAIN. 27th September, 1949. As reported in telegrams Nos. 33 and 34 from Muscat I had discussions with the Sultan on the 24th and 25th of September about exploration for oil in the Huqf area in Southern Arabia. At my first interview I said that we were very anxious to find oil in this area as the carry would be so much shorter than it is from the Persian Gulf. There were two alternatives either to give the. Sultan funds to raise a force strong enough to protect the company* s personnel while they were establishing themselves in the area and operating in it or to give the company a free hand to make such arrange ments as they wished direct with the tribes. The Sultan said that he would consider the matter but that in no circumstances would he give the company a free hand as it was this policy that had led to so much trouble in the Buraimi area. I asked him when he would be able to let us have a reply and he enquired when he might expect a reply about the oil company*s Intentions in Dhofar. 2. The next day he came to see me at the Agency and showed great interest in the Huqf project. He asked me first of all to explain in more detail the proposal that he should be given financial assistance to raise a force. I said that the idea was that he should be given money and materials to enable him to recruit and train from 200 to 400 tribesmen for the. protec tion of the company* s personnel when landing on the coast and operating in the interior. He then said that before making up his mind what to do he must know in more detail what the company's plans were and asked the following questionss- (a) Where do the company propose to make a landing ? (b) Will they operate from the coast or from a base in the interior ? (c) How far inland will they penetrate ? (d) What is the number of personnel involved ? (e) Will the company provide rations and trucks for the local guards it will be necessary to employ ? I will ask Lermitte to let me have the replies to these ques tions here and communicate them to the Sultan. 3. The Sultan went on to say that the only tribes involved are the Janabah and the Harasis. The Wahibah lived a long way away. If the company proposed to confine their operations to the coastal area only the Janabah would be concerned and he would deal with them through the Janabah shaikhs of the Sur area with whom they had connections. If the company penetra ted further inland they would enter the Harasis country and he would deal with this tribe through their own shaikhs who recog nised his authority. When Thesiger visited their country they had sent a deputation of fifty men to his Wali in Dhofar and enquired what attitude they should adopt. They had been instructed not to allow any stranger to visit their country in /future B.A.B. Burrows, Esq., Foreign Office, London.- 2 - future without his permission. At a later stage he said that about the 1st October he would send two special men to enquire about the conditions prevailing in the area in which we are interested. , 4. I then pointed out to the Sultan the uproar that should probably occur in the press and elsewhere if the Huqf were occupied by force and casualties incurred and expressed a fear that the Imam might create trouble. The Sultan admitted the first point and it is clear that he hopes to obtain a footing for the company by negotiation rather than force* With regard to the second point he said that the Imam had no influence or authority whatever in the area concerned and it was uni versally recognised that his jurisdiction ended at the Bilan^fX Bani bu Hasan. This contradicts Thesiger but I should hesi tate to say that the Sultan Is necessarily wrong. I think Thesiger has rather exaggerated ideas of the extent of the Imam’s authority and the 'golden age” enjoyed under his rule. The Sultan went on to say that his relations with the Imam were most cordial, that they frequently exchanged correspondence and that he had recently sent one of his Walls to treat him for cataract (which he did, I gather, by branding him on the forehead and cheekbone !). At this point I mentioned the possibility of the Saudis trying to deal with the Imam as a separate entity during the boundary negotiations and he replied that in all foreign matters he and the Imam were one. He confirmed that in any case the Imam and his followers had a religious hate of the Wahabis. 5. The Sultan may be over optimistic but we must obviously allow him to endeavour to obtain an entry for the oil company to the Huqf area by negotiation with the tribes concerned as the first move in the game. I will report his further re actions after the replies to his questions in para 2 have been communicated to him. 6.

Dear Residency, Will you please refer to your letter No.6/37/49 of May 4th about the employment of Hungarians and Roumanians by Petroleum Concessions Limited. We have thought it best to take up this question with P.C.L.'s London Office and you will see from the enclosed copy of a letter to Longrigg that we have informed him that H.M.G. do not favour the recruit ment of Hungarians and Roumanians in Qatar and the Trucial Coast. In coming to this decision we have taken into account the fact that any Hungarians or Roumanians who might be recruited by P.C.L. would probably have relations in their countries of births by pressure or threat of pressure on these relatives the Communist Regimes might be able to make use of the men working for P.C.L., however hostile they might personally be to Communism to act as propagandists or as active agents for Communism. Although Hungarians may possibly still be able to leave their countries legally, Roumanians could certainly not unless they were agents provocateurs. Yours ever, EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

Lermitte, Bird and Henderson were present and to say that it was understood that 1) The Company would be able to send a party to the Huqf area about October this year. 2) The party would land at a place to be selected on the coast south west of Masirah where it would establish a base from which to operate. Your Highness was understood to have said that the people who could give advice as to the best site for a base on the coast were in Sur and would be consulted. We understood Your Highness would let us know the result of your enquiries as soon as possible. 3) Armed guards (abid) would be provided by the Muscat Govt., commanded by a responsible person selected by Your Highness and that they would be available in Muscat in time to be collected and transported by the Company to the site of our operations. I am now to ask Your Highness if you would be good enough to confirm that this understanding is correct in order that the Company may start planning for its work in that area next winter. We shall also be glad to know what site on the coast Your Highness recommends for use as our base. Yours faithfully, * t (Sd) Richard Bird. p.p.

I spoke to the Sultan on 27th April about the behaviour of the Naim and A1 Bu Shamis towards Mr. Bird's party at / Buraimi. The Sultan said that he had expected the Naim to create difficulties and this was why he had asked Mr. Bird to abandon the expedition for this year. He had finally yielded to his persuasion and reluctantly agreed that the parjfcy should set out. He made no suggestions regarding what should be done next. 2. I also handed to the Sultan a copy of a letter from Mr. Lermitte asking for permission to explore the Huqf area (opposite Masirah Island) next cold weather.

Burrows of the Foreign Office to Sir H. Hay, Residency, BahraA Please refer tc your despatch Ko. 164 (228/2/48) dated 6th December 1948, on the subject of Petroleum Concessions’ exploration in Dhofar. I agree generally with the views expressed in paragraph 2 of your despatch but the extract from the minutes of a meeting with oil company representatives which I enclose puts rather a different complexion on the matter. We feel that the Sultan must be held in play until the strategical possibilities of finding and exporting oil from Southern Cman have been explored. I enclose also a copy of a letter sent by Longrigg to Nuttall. If the Sultan is pressing for a reply he can be told that the Company hope to be able to say something definite to him when he visits this country. (SGD). B.A.B. BURROWS.* • . 3 Copy of letter dated the 4th March from Mr, S.H. Longrigg of the Iraq Petro fe urn Company Limited, 214, Oxford Street, London W.l to Mr, W.L.F. Nuttall, Ministry of Fuel and Power. Kitchin tells me that you have been enquiring about our intentions with regard to our Dhcfar Concession and would like from us some statement of our position. You are av/are that we have sent Geologists into the Dhofar territory twice, once before the war and once since. They have not reported any formations of interest, although I should ada that their full report upon the 1948/4S • expedition is not yet to hand. Cur own Geologists however - that is, those of the I.P.C as distinct from those of our constituent Groups - have expressed the view that the territory does not appear to be worth holding. We are aware at the same time that the Sultan of Muscat would like us to abandon the Dhofar concession so that, as he says, he could admit the geologists of other companies to see if they find anything which we have missed. And we realize that it would not be easy or satisfactory merely to retain the territory and do nothing further about it. There is, therefore, a case ofor giving it up. I am not, however, able to tell you that this decision has yet been reached. Firstly, we should wish for unanimity in that sense among our Group Geologists: and secondly, we cannot forget that the inland frontier, as against Saudi Arabia, is quite unfixed,, which means that if a northerly alternative is finally adopted, a wide area of country towards or in the Ruba al Khali would be included in Dhofar - an area which we have not seen yet. I I shall probably be able to inform you of the Company's final decision in the matter about the middle of May.Mr. Skliros said that the I.P.C intersts considered that the terms of their existing concessions, except in the case of Qatar, included the territorial waters of the areas concerned, but that I.P.C intersts intended to make no claim to any area outside territorial waters. Mr. Burrows then asked Mr. Skliros if he could give any indication of the prospects of the I.P.C intersts finding oil in Southern Oman in sufficient quantities to justify its export southwards through the South Coast of Arabia rather than through the Narrows of the Persian Gulf which from a strategic point of view were more vulnerable to interference by a hostile power. Mr. Skliros said that the I.P.C interests had not been able to go as deep into the interior of Oman as they could have wished as the Sultan had been unable to arrange for the protection of the Company’s survey parties. He knew that the Sultan was not satisfied with the progress made so fai and would like the I.P.C interests to abandon their concession in Dhofar. It was possible that the Company would agree to do this. They had arranged in any case to give him a present of an extra £10,000 and in the meantime were arranging for another survey, the results of which they hoped to give to the Sultan when he came to the United Kingdom this spring.Confidential (2D PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN, 19th March, 1949. (36/9/49) In paragraph 2 of my semi-official letter (35/3/49) of the 25th January I reported that the Sultan had agreed that Petroleum Concessions Limited should send their geological party into the Buraimi area at once and that Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the Na^m should be ignored. 2. The party in due course travelled to the Buralmi area from the Batinah Coast by the Wadi al Jlzzl. They were fired at by a solitary sniper in the Wadi but sustained no casualltles. When they reached Buralml, the Na*im openly stated that they did not recognise the Sultan’s authority and demanded that the Company should enter into a separate agreement with them. The Al bu d hamis subsequently adopted the same attitude. The party therefore withdrew to Sharjah, and Bird, its leader has left for the United Kingdom. 3. We cannot in my opinion connive at this flouting of the Sultan’s authority by encouraging the company to enter into separate agreements with the tribes concerned, nor can we compel the tribes to submit to the Sultan's authority. We must, I think, advise the company to be patient and hope that the tribes in due course will knew realise that it will pay them better to work with the Sultan than against him. B.a.B.

Bazaar rumour has it that Sheikh Saqr refused to discuss the question with Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim and demanded an initial payment of 5 lakhs before opening negotations. Bird refused to pay the amount and the party returned. Local gossip is that Saqr told Saiyid Ibrahim that in the past the Sultan had no thought for the tribes and treated them with scant courtesy but now that there was appossibility of oil being found in the area the Sultan's attitude had changed. Saqr is also said to have stated that since Britain cannot now employ Indian troops xitadbEk against the tribes, and Buraimi is too far for British warships to pound, there only way of pacifying the tribes is by money and direct negotations with 9 H9. them.Vw XT . r : ^b/3/4D) PERSIA*: dU' R^IDiixCY, BaHIUIK . 25th January, 1949* Please refer to ay bettor (228/7/4B) of the dCth December on tiie subject of Petroleum Concessions Li dted’s prograisise of exploration in Buraimi. 2* Longrlgg and Lar^d tte l^ve recently beei, tc see the Sultan arid he has withdrawn the letter in which he stated that he considered that the Company 1 * work in Buralmi shouir be post poned for this season, and the Company therefore intend to send their geological party into the area'at once, 'ihc oultan has taken over responsibility for 'pollties j. direction” in tiie area and lias agreed that bhaikh ^aqr bin bultari of tlie ha’im, who has not yet gone U&gt; see him, should be ignored as it is believed that his following in his tribe is a small one. 3.

British Residency, Bahrain, Persian Gulf.PEhSlAN GULP RESIDENCY t BAHRAIN, 20th Lecemb»r, 1948. In my monthly Imttmr for November, I stated that It vas hoped that Petroleum Concessions Limited would be able to carry out their current season's programme of exploration In Buraimi and the Dhahirah without trouble to themselves and without treading on the Sultan's toes. Unfortunately this hope now appears unlikely to be fulfilled, as two days after I left Muscat, the Sultan wrote to Bird stating that he considered that the Company's work In Buraimi should be postponed this season. The Sultan gave no reason in his letter. I have discussed the situation with Lermitte and Bird who consider it probable th^t the Sultan has received some unsatisfactory letter from Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the Na'im. All the important Shaikhs of the area concerned have been to see the Sultan, and assured him of their loyalty, except Shaikh Saqr, who has been hesitating and now apparently refused to come in. Bird hoped to go and see the Sultan in December and if possible take Saqr with him, but has been compelled to postpone his visit on account of illness. He now hopes to visit Muscat in January for a talk with the Sultan, and it remains to be seen whether Saqr will also go there or not. 2. While I was discussing this subject with Lermitte and Bird, they stated that even if some satisfactory arrangement were reached with the Sultan and Saqr this year, the state of the country was such that they saw little prospect of being able to carry out continued operations in it over a number of years unless they were supported by some kind of forces. There have recently been two cases of the shooting up of Government officers or oil company personnel in the neighbourhood, though the incidents in both cases were more in the nature of demonstrations and there does not appear to have been any serious attempt to kill. Lerraitte said he considered that a mobile force of about 60 men locally recruited from the tribes, in the same manner as the Arab Legion in Transjordan, would be sufficient for the purpose, provided they had a competent officer in charge of them. I replied that I thought it might be difficult to obtain Government approval, except perhaps after a long delay, for a proposal of this nature, even though Government were admittedly very much interested in the development of oil in the area, and I also pointed out that there were objections to the employment of a Government force in the Sultan's territory* I suggested therefore, that the Company should raise and train its own force of guards with the Sultan's consent.
