The main lists in the file include columns for the serial number (the confidential subject letter and an incremental number), the file/volume number (derived from the A and B series), the file title, and the date range associated with the file.A typewritten note at the front of the file (folio 2) states that files marked with a red cross were destroyed in September 1939 (the eve of World War Two) on the Political Resident’s orders. The note also states that files marked with a blue pencil ‘B’ have been retained at Bushire (the date of the note, 1 June 1947, coincides with the Residency’s relocation from Bushire to Bahrain. A handwritten addition, dated 18 February 1953, states that files marked ‘FO’ were scheduled for transfer to the Foreign Office.The file lists are typewritten, but include numerous subsequent annotations marked in black, red and blue pencil, and black/blue ink. There are handwritten additions to many of the lists, indicating new files opened after the creation of the index. Other annotations indicate changes in the status of files, including: destruction in 1927, 1939, 1946 and 1953, weeding, intention to transfer certain files to the Foreign Office in 1953, and amendments to file dates.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100022598735.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
