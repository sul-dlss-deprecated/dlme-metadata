Lipit-Ishtar (also rendered as Lipit-Eshtar) ruled over the city-state of Isin (in south central Iraq) ca. 1934-1924 BCE. To establish the extent of his power, Lipit-Ishtar lists the territories (Sumer and Akkad) as well as the cities (Nippur, Ur, Eridu, and Uruk) then under the control of Isin. The section about setting “justice in the lands of Sumer and Akkad” may refer to the law-code of Lipit-Ishtar, which predated the more famous laws of Hammurabi of Babylon by about a century. Around one hundred examples of this text are known, of which the Walters Art Museum has three. \r\n\r\nClay cones and nails were inscribed in the name of a ruler of a Mesopotamian city-state to commemorate an act of building or rebuilding, often of a temple for a specific deity. Deposited in the walls or under the foundations of these structures, the words of the texts were directed at the gods but would be found by later restorers.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1929", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/498", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Edgar J.
