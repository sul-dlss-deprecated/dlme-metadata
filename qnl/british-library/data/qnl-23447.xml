Bahrain, September 3, 1945. Certificate. Mr. F.J. Wakelin held the post of Director of Education in the Government of Bahrain for four years, from 1941 till 1945. He came at a time when conditions in the Department were diffi cult as neither teachers nor boys had become accustomed to the various new systems introduced by Mr. Wakelin’s predecessor. Mr. Wakelin tackled his duties with keenness and sensibility and during the four years that he was in Bahrain his interest in his work was sustained. He did work which will be of lasting use and produced satisfactory results. He firmly established the Government Secondary School and enlarged the scope of the hostel which became a cultural centre for schoolboys and boys who had left school. His relations with the teaching staff and with the boys were good. When he left Bahrain a number of leading merchants petitioned to His Highness asking that Mr. Wakelin should retain the post. Sd. C.
