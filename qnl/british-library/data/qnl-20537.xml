V.Biscoe, The Hon'ble Political Resident, The British Residency. 'pi 1 o' 1 - Sir usdire KIH-I-MUND TEST AREA We have the honour to advise you that the present position at Kuh-i-Mund is as follows:- About 120 labourers are no.; employed cutting the road from Bunds rvLavar along the newly surveyed line of entry into the area. Arrangements are being made to provide a motor maheilla to run between Lavar and Bushire in addition to the runner who goes every Monday morning by the overland route to convey to Mr.Shields messages.letters,etc. Fakhi Hohamed Khan the ruling Khan of the Lavar area is at present in Bushire and arrangements are being concluded to employ his son Abbas Khan as head guard - in charge of a number of guards to be provided by Fakhi Molumed Khan under the instructions of h.e .the Governor. These guards will be armed with Government rifles for which special license villi be obtained - their number is now being considered by h.s. and will be communicated to Abadsn within the next few days. Everything is quite quiet at Lavar and there seems to be every hope that the survey will go through with no Political trouble. For your confidential information we beg to advise you that the Russian engineers who are now surveying the projected land route from Bushire to Bunder -Abbas via Lingah are reported to have made anti-British expressions of opinion to some of the locals at Lavar. The Company has decided not to pursue this petty propaganda as they feel that they will only attract attention to something that, left alone, will die a, natural death. You will be kept au fait aith the movement of affairs at Kuh-i-Mund and anything of important nature which transpires will be communicated to you immediately. L.
