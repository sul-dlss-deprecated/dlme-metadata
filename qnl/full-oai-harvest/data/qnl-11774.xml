The file begins with details of a request from the Sultan to appoint an officer (preferably British) as Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the possibility of the officer also being required to act as financial adviser. The correspondence documents British efforts over the course of three years to recruit a suitable officer. It includes discussion of potential candidates, as well as related matters such as the terms of employment for the position and the difficulty of finding a suitable British candidate with some knowledge of Arabic. Candidates considered for the role include a British Indian officer named Lieutenant-Colonel Mohamed Ataullah, and numerous British officials such as William Harold Ingrams, Colonel Valentine Hugh Wilfred Dowson, and the explorer Wilfred Thesiger. An appointment was eventually made in October 1948, with Lieutenant-Colonel Basil Woods Ballard accepting the position.Notable correspondents include the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; officials of the Government of India's External Affairs Department, the India Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, the Foreign Office, and the Colonial Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Basil Woods Ballard</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Wilfred Patrick Thesiger</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Valentine Hugh Wilfred Dowson</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Conditions of employment</topic></subject><subject><topic>Recruitment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000033#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000033#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000033#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000033#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
