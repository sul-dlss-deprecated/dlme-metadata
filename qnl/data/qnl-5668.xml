This proposal was ultimately refused due to the resistance of the Russian and British governments for its perceived contravention of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, which had divided Persia into Russian and British zones of influence.The majority of the correspondence in the file is between Sir Edward Grey, Foreign Secretary; Sir George Barclay, British Ambassador to Persia; and Sir George Buchanan, British Ambassador to Russia. The file contains a limited amount of correspondence in French, including drafts of letters to be sent from the British Government to the Government of Persia. Copies of correspondence between Shuster and Barclay are also enclosed in the file.The volume includes a divider which gives the year that the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in it arranged by year. This divider is placed at the front of the volume.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Russia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Treasurer-General</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Claude Bayfield Stokes</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Russian Entente (1907)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000058#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000058#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000058#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
