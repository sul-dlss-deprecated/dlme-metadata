ARTICLE I. The powers declare that the most effective means for counteracting the Slave Trade in the interior of Africa are the following ;— 1. Progressive organization of the administra tive, judicial, religious, and military services in the African territories placed under the sovereignty or protectorate of civilized nations. 2. The gradual establishment in the interior by the Powers to which the territories are subject of strongly occupied stations, in such a way as to make their protective or repressive action effectively felt in the territories devastated by slave-hunting. 3. The construction of roads, and in particular of railways, connecting the advanced stations with the coast, and permitting easy access to the inland waters, and to such of the upper courses of the rivers and streams as are broken by rapids and cataracts, in view of substituting economical and rapid means of transport for the present means of carriage by men. 4. Establishment of steam-boats on the inland navigable waters and on the lakes, supported by fortified posts established on the banks. 5. Establishment of telegraphic lines, insuring the communication of the posts and stations with the coast and with the administrative centres. 6. Organization of expeditions and flying columns, to keep up the communication of the stations with each other and with the coast, to support repressive action, and to insure the security of high roads. 7. Restriction of the importation of fire-arms, at least of modern pattern, and of ammunition throughout the entire extent of the territories infected by the Slave Trade. \ ARTICLE II. The stations, the inland cruizers organized by each Power in its waters, and the posts which serve as ports of register for them shall, independently of their principal task, which is to prevent the capture of slaves and intercept the routes of the Slave Trade, have the following subsidiary duties :— 1. To support and, if necessary, to serve as a refuge for the native populations, whether placed under the sovereignty or the protectorate of the State to which the station is subject, or independ ent, and temporarily for all other natives in case of imminent danger; to place the populations of the first of these categories in a position to co -operate for their own defence j to diminish inland wars between tribes by means of arbitration ; to initiate them in agricultural works and in the industrial arts so as to increase their welfare; to raise themto civilization and bring about the extinction of larbarous customs, such as cannibalism and human sacrifices. 2. To give aid and protection to commercial undertakings; to watch over their legality by controlling especially contracts of service with natives, and to lead up to the foundation of per manent centres of cultivation and of commercial establishments. 3. To protect, without distinction of creed, the Missions which are already or are about to be established. 4. To provide for the sanitary service, and to grant hospitality and help to explorers and to all who take part in Africa in the work of repressing the Slave Trade. ARTICLE III. The Powers exercising a sovereignty or a protec torate in Africa confirm and give precision to their former declarations, and undertake to proceed gradually, as circumstances permit, either by the means above indicated, or by any other means which they may consider suitable, with the repres sion of the Slave Trade, each State in its respective possessions and under its own direction. When ever they consider it possible, they will lend their good offices to the Powers which, with a purelv humanitarian object, may be engaged in Africa upon a similiar mission, ARTICLE IV. The States exercising sovereign powers or pro tectorates in Africa may in all cases delegate to Companies provided with Charters all or a portion of the engagements which they assume in virtue of Article III. They remain, nevertheless, directly responsible for the engagements which they con tract by the present Act, and guarantee the execu tion thereof. The Powers promise to receive, aid, and protect the national Associations and enter prises due to private initiative which may wish to co-operate in their possessions in the repression of the Slave Trade, subject to their receiving previous authorization, such authorization being revocable at any time, subject also to their being directed and controlled, and to the exclusion of the exercise of rights of sovereignty. ARTICLE V. The Contracting Powers undertake, unless this has already been provided for by their laws in accordance with the spirit of the present Article, to enact or propose to their respective Legislatures in the course of one year at latest from the date of the signature of the present General Act a Law for rendering applicable, on the one hand, the provisions of their penal laws concerning the graver offences against the person, to the organizers and abettors of slave-hunting, to perpetrators of the mutilation of adulls and male infants, and to all persons who may take part in the capture of slaves by violence; and, on the other hand, the provisions relating to offences against individual liberty, to carriers, transporters, and dealers in slaves. The associates and accessories of the different categories of slave captors and dealers above speci fied shall be punished with penalties proportionate to those incurred by the principals. Guilty persons who may have escaped from jurisdiction of the authorities of the country^, Admimstr the crimes or offences have been committed si fi re ' arms 1 be arrested either on communication of the in fr om Sl i l&lt; '' 1 minatory evidence by the authorities who fo ^ on ^ ^ ascertained the violation of the law, or on prod . tion of any other proof of guilt by the Power re ^ use ^ whose territory they may have been discoverd j suc ^, aS 1 shall be kept without other formality at the disa W j e of the Tribunals competent to try them. ridges, c: them.

ARTICLE VII. Any fugitive slave claiming on the continent: protection of a Signatory Power shall obtain: and shall be received in the camps and static officially established by such Power, or on k the vessels of such Power plying on the lakes j rivers. Private stations and boats are only pern ted to exercise the right of asylum subject to t previous sanction of such Power. • ARTICLE VIII. The experience of all nations who have int course with Africa having shown the pernicious a; preponderating' part played by fire-arm s in SL Trade operations as well as in inlcrnal vvar betw the native tribes; and this same experience havi: clearly proved that the preservation of the Afria populations whose existence it is the express « of the Powers to safeguard is a radical impos bilitv if restrictive measures against the trade lire-arms and ammunition are not established, t Powers decide, in so far as the present state their frontiers permits, that the importation offc arms, and especially of rifles and improved we»p« as well as of powder, balls, and cartridges,: except in the cases and under the conditions p: vided for in the following Article, prohibited ii)! territories comprised between the ^Oth parallel north latitude and the 22 nd parallel of son latitude, and extending westward to the Atlfflt Ocean and eastward to the Indian Ocean, and dependencies, comprising the islands adjacent j the coast as far as 1UU nautical miles frnm' shore. ARTICLE IX. The introduction of fire-arms and ammuniti when there shall be occasion to authorize it in' possessions of the Signatory Powers which exert rights of sovereignty or of protectorate in Afe shall be regulated, unless identical or morerigon Regulations have been already applied, in f* following manner in the zon e laid down in Arti All imported fire-arms shall be deposited, at ; cost, risk, and peril of the importers, in a warehouse placed under the supervision of ^ Indepe by Gover and the &lt; exception sufficient delivered sold to tl with a d that the exclusive ,w All an ing parac the authc shall deli bear arm showing These li&lt; improper but may The rn shall also From flint-lock gunpowd traite '). nition of shall det and amn by the Persons i the publi Adminisl indicatin sold, as i store-hoi The G may dee ment as importaf and amr entry or the pass: Trade is The a of the Z( withhelc pass acr Power i: inland t protecto Power, i to the se&gt;» ^3 1 ; escaped from • the country wii. i committed s| ,tion of the horities who ^ iw, or on prod, by the Power )een disco verd,! ility at the disp y them. ite to each of: elay the Laws i in execution e of the stopps iterior of the t amstances pert , the local autk &gt;ssible th^ir ma elp them to set i the continent; r shall obtain: mps and statio iver, or on ba on the lakes i ;s are only pem m subject tot [. who have lntf the pernicious»: re-arm s in Sir ernalwar betwd jxperience hare on of the Afria the express a- radical impos inst the trade: ; established, t present state nportation offtt m proved weapoi id cartridges,; e conditions p: prohibited int ^Oth parallel parallel of soc to the Atlait i Ocean, and ands adjacent i 1 miles from' and ammuniti ithorize it in )rs which borate in Ate i or more rigor• applied, in l g . . down in Art* deposited, at kers, in a pervision of Administration of the State. No withdrawal of fire-arms or imported ammunition shall take place from such depots without the previous authoriza tion of the Administration. This authorization shall be, except in cases hereinafter specified, refused for the withdrawal of all arms of precision, such as rifles, magazine-guns, or breech-loaders, whether whole or in detached pieces, their cart ridges, caps, or other ammunition intended for them. At the seaports and under conditions affording the needful guarantees the respective Grovernments may permit private depots, but only for ordinary powder and flint-lock muskets, and to the exclusion of improved arms and their ammunition. Independently of the measures directly taken by Governments for the arming of the public force and the organization of their defence, individual exceptions shall be admitted for persons affording sufficient guarantees that the arm and ammunition delivered to them will not be given, assigned, or sold to third persons, and for travellers provided with a declaration of their Government stating that the weapon and ammunition are destined exclusively for their personal defence. All arms in the cases provided for in the preced ing paragraph shall be registered and marked by the authorities appointed lor the supevision, who shall deliver to the persons in question licences to bear arms, indicating the name of the bearer and showing the stamp with which the arm is marked. These licences are revocable in case of proved improper use, and will be issued for five years only, but may be renewed. The rule above set forth as to shall also apply to gunpowder From the depots can be withdrawn for sale only flint-lock guns, with unrifled barrels, and common gunpowders, called trade powders (' poudres de traite - '). At each withdrawal of arms and ammu nition of this kind for sale, the local authorities shall determine the regions in which these arms and ammunition may be sold. The regions infected by the Slave Trade shall always be excluded. Persons authorized to take arms or powder out of the public depots (warehouses) shall present to the Administration every six months detailed lists indicating the destinations of the arms and powder sold, as well as the quantities still remaining in the store-houses. ARTICLE X. The Governments shall take all measures they may deem necessary to insure as complete a fulfil ment as possible of the provisions respecting the importation, the sale, and transport of fire-arms and ammunition, as well,as to prevent either the entry or exit thereof by their inland frontiers, or the passage thereof to regions where the Slave Trade is rife. The authorization of transit within the limits of the zone specified by Article VIII cannot be withheld when the arms and ammunition are to pass across the territory of a Signatory or adherent Power in the occupation of the coast, towards inland territories placed under the sovereignty or protectorate of another Signatory or adherent Power, unless this latter Power have direct access to the sea through its own territory. It this access placing in depot be completely interrupted, the authorization of transit can no longer be withheld. Any demand of transit must be accompanied by a declaration emanating from the Government of the Power having the inland possessions, and certifying that the said arms and ammunition are not destined for sale, but are for the use of the authorities of such Power, or of the military forces necessary for the protection of the missionary or commercial stations, or of persons mentioned by name in the declaration. Nevertheless, the territorial Power of the coast retains the right to stop, exceptionally and provi sionally, the transit of arms of precision and ammunition across its territory, if in consequence of inland disturbances or other serious danger there is ground for fearing that the dispatch of arms and ammunition might compromise its own safety. ARTICLE XI. The Powers shall communicate to each other the information relating to the traffic in fire-arms and ammunition, the licences granted, and the measures of repression in force in their respective territories. ARTICLE XII. The Powers undertake to adopt or to propose to their respective Legislatures the measures necessary to insure the punishment everywhere of infringers of the prohibitions laid down m Articles VIII and IX, and that of their accomplices, besides the seizure and confiscation of the prohibited arms and ammunition, either by fine or by imprisonment, or by both penalties together, in proportion to the importance of the infraction, and in accordance with the gravity of each case. ARTICLE XIII. The Signatory Powers who have in Africa possessions in contact with the zone specified in Article VIII bind themselves to take the necessary measures for preventing the introduction of fire arms and ammunition across their inland frontiers into the regions of the said zone, at least that of improved arms and cartridges. ARTICLE XIV. The system stipulated in Articles VIII to XIII shall remain in force during twelve years. In case none of the Contracting Parties shall have notified, twelve months before the expiration of this period, its intention of putting an end to it, or shall have demanded its revision, it shall continue to remain obligatory for two more years, and shall thus continue in force from two years to two years. Chapter II.— Caravan Routes and the Land Transport of Slaves. ARTICLE XV. independently of the repressive or protective action which they exercise in the centres of the Slave Trade, the stations, cruizers, and posts the establishment of which is provided for in Article II, and all other stations established or recognized by Article IV by each Government in its possessions, will furthermore have the mission of supervising so far as circumstances will permit, and in proportion to the progress of their administrative organization, the roads followed on their territory by the slave- dealers, there to stop the convoys in their march, or to pursue them wherever their action can be legally exercised.&gt; ' ARTICLE XVI. In the regions of the coast known to serve habitually as places of passage or terminal points for Slave Traffic coming from the interior, as well as at the points of intersection of the principal caravan routes crossing the zone contiguous to the coast already subject to the influence of the or Protective Powers, posts shall be established under the conditions and with the reservations mentioned in Article III by the authorities to whom the territories are subject, with the purpose of intercepting the convoys and liberating the slaves. ARTICLE XVII. A rigorous watch shall be organized by the local authorities at the ports and places near the coast in view of preventing the sale and shipping of the slaves brought from the interior, as well as the formation and departure landwards of the bands of slave-hunters and dealers. Caravans arriving at the coast or in its vicinity, as well as those arriving in the interior at a locality occupied by the territorial Power, shall, on their arrival, be submitted to a minute inspection as to the persons composing them. Any such person being ascertained to have been captured or carried off by force or mutilated, either in his native place or on the way, shall be liberated. ARTICLE XVIII. In the possessions of each of the Contracting Powers the Administration shall have the duty of protecting the liberated slaves, to repatriate them . if possible, to procure for them means of existence and, in particular, to take charge of the education and subsequent employment of abandoned children. ARTICLE XIX. The penal arrangements provided for in Article V shall be applicable to all offences committed in the course of the operations connected with the transport and Traffic of Slaves on land whenever such offences may be ascertained. Any person having incurred a penalty in conse quence of an offence provided for by the present Act shall incur the obligation of providing security before being able to undertake any commercial operation in countries where the Slave Trade is carried on. Chapter III.— Repeession of the Sea-borne Slave Trade. § I. General Provisions. ARTICLE XX. The Signatory Powers acknowledge the oppor tuneness of taking steps in common for the more effective repression of the Slave Trade in the mari time zone in which it still exists. ARTICLE XXI. The zone extends, on the one hand, between the coasts of the Indian Ocean (those of the Persian Gulf and of the Red Sea included) from BeiucJiusian to Cape Tangalane (Quilimane), and, on the other hand, a conventional line which first follows the meridian from Tangalane till it meets the 26th degree of south latitude ; it is then merg ed in this parallel, then passes round the Island Re of Madagascar by the east, keeping 20 milej, II. the east and north shore, till it crosses the merit at Cape Ambre. From this point the limit of] zone is determined by an oblique line which,' tends to the coast of Bekichistdn, passing 20 n i Rule off Cape Ras-el-Had. ARTICLE XXII.

At present nothing has been done, hut I am sending the Legation a few copies of a Persian translation of the General Act,and will mention the need for action by the Persian authorities', until that is taken we can do nothing more than we have hitherto been able to do under existing Treaties. It might be useful also to enquire from the Ambassador at Consuant inople whether the Ottoman Govt has taken any steps under Art LXVIII,and to bring to notice the frequent importations at Koweit 9 which is a great dis tributing centre for the countries bordering on the Persian Gulf of slaves brought overland from Jeddah. I was told some time ago that there is a large traffic in slaves from Pelool,a port below Massowah and in the inds of the Italians,and that most of those which are zen to Arabia come from that place. The Aden author- % i t i esauthorities no doubt can verify the point,which was mentioned to me by Capt Cross of the Cossack, That part of the Gulf of Oman which belongs to Persia is referrea to in Art LXIX as a separate locality: 'presumably however that part which is under Maskat is included in the maritime zone defined in Art XXI, though it might have been better,as being more pre- cisely correct,to add the words'Gulf of Oman'after 'Persian Gulf'in that Art. It woula be well I think to invite the Sultan of Uaskat,under Art XCVIII.to give in his adhesion to the Act. It might be aifficult for His Highness to accept the General Act in its entirety,from considerations that will appear on reading the correspondence enaing with Foreign Department letter No 1093E of the 25th May 1891,but he might subscribe to Chap IV. It is unfortunate that the Sultan is crippled by want % of an armed vessel with which to enforce respect for his authority,but he is not likely to be able to raise t the necessary funas on his own account,and,as you are no doubt awaretGovemment have not seen their way to granting him a loan on the conditions he wished to \to impose. I should he glad in the event of his agreeing properly officered there would point being reconsidered. Wi ing his oraers the adhesion Act would be purely nominal. he shoula he in a posi tion to act along his own coast: our cruisers can act out at sea and beyond Ras~ul~Hadd, but they cannot be everywhere 9 and there can be little aoubt of the continued frequency of slave importations into Oman when there are constant exhortations from it into Persia and the Pirate coast-unless indeed slaves are bred in Oman for export&gt;as I have been told they are in some villages on the opposite coast. In any case however exportation from the Batineh coast calls for greater vigilance all along it, Bahrein and tke Trucial Chiefs should I think come into the general scheme f so as to make it universal in these waters:probably they would agree to follow the Sultan's lead especially if they understood that they woula be alone in opposition,ana vjould be even more carefully watched than hitherto, so as to deprive them of their ch i efI chief source of supply from Oman. Please let me nnow if it is thought desirable to approach the Sultan ana the rest on thNo: / Of 2893.

I 1 uo 'existing Treaties between the British Govern ment and the Truoial Jhiefs' of which your office has a copy, there has been an Agreement in force since 1879 among the Sheikhs inter s© in regard to the treatment of indebted divers absconding irom one principality to another to evade debt. This agreement has been a valuable instrument for the preservation of peace both on the -trab ^oast itpeif and on th© pearl banks, is regarded as a very-*^ ' important safe-guard^ of their interests by the Sheikhs them selves, and is consistently upheld by us, ? During the last year or two, however, I have had a great deal of difficulty withthe Trucial Sheikhs owing to the tendency of indebted divers, not necessarily slaves by any means, to bolt over to Bunder Abbas and Lingah and obtain manumission certificates there on their bare statements (or after inadequate verification) and thus evade the Instrument of 1879. In consequence I instructed our Agents last year to continue to give such fugutives sanctuary as heretofore but to postpone issue of manumission certificates until they had communicated with the Residency and ascertained the history of th© case.

It is advisable therefore that whenover pooaible the history of each case should be inquired into before tlie certifi- cato iasues; and in the Gulf where we have oo many Agents and are in such close touch with the native Chiefs, it is hardly possible for a case to occur where the verification of a negro's story would not be easily pOBsible, under these ciroumstances, seeing that nis iiajesty^ Chips are liable to be used as a source of refuge in the same way as our Agencies on shore, I write to ask you if you see no special objection, to enquire from iiis Excellency the liaval .o: : , .nder-in-Ohief whether he could see his way to extend the application of the special instructions contained in the Station Order Booic or the Squadron in respect of . .uscat, to other ports in the oulf where there is a British Political Officer#besio, li® v &lt;: ^sian.,%^ H.M.S.

Dear Major Cox, I have received your D.O. letter of 2nd inst * ' 1 one to fugitiv e slaves and I quite see your point and appreciate the difficulty and misunderstanding that can arise. a1 aoughj^s I informed you, Cominanding Officesn- of H-M.Ships in the Gulf have special instructions in the Station order Book v /ith regard to the procei^dure in the case or fugitive slaves from Muscat Territory, there are other instructions in the Station Order Boo^ which specially draw attention to the prescription of Commanding Officers of H.M. Ships in the matter of granting immediate and definitive freedom to fugitive slaves received on board their vessels under the powers conveyed by Art .mill of the Brussels Act of 1889» Therefore, before representing the matter to the Commander in Chief, I write to ask whether it would meet your requirements if a fugitive, seeking refuge and being received oh board one of H.M.Ships in the Gulf and given a manumission certificate by the 0.0. on prima facie evidence of being d slave, were kept on board the ship and handed over, together with his certificate^ at the first con - venient opportunity to the Political Officer concerned. TheIh= latter t„„ M lh . of To acc ordingly # in the event of the fugitive tu^ out not to b J a slave I uoula suggest that the manumission certificate, obtained under false pretences, should be for • f01 ^ the Po:Liu&amp;al Officer and returned to the flom - manding officer of the ship endorsed to that effect. T ' C aain POin,; ls ' 1 understand, to determine whether the fugitive is or is n6t a bona fide slave or merelya fu - gitive from Justice or debt .Clearly a Political Officer is in a better position to determine this point than the 0.0. of the ship and if the fugitive is not a slave Article JCXmi of the Brussels Act is of course inapplicable. If you see no objection to this alternative course I propose to submitter the consideration of the Commander-in- Chief as an alternative to an extension of the special in - stractions with reference to Muscat waters and I would su £ - gest that the procedure, if approved, should be applicable to all Gulf waters including those of Muscat. //^ &lt;*&lt;!&lt;■ &amp;S-Z* *e- /J d&lt; 12th June 1909• W ^any tiianks for your deml official let tor of 4tlx Juno In answer to mine of iind. I fear the alternative suggeation which you make ould not meet the case from my point of view, and it oeeme to me open to objection on principle. ihe .axn point, in fact the whole point, is, as you rightly say in your penultimate paragraph, to deter- -i.o v/iio^iior a rofugee negro is really a olave or only a fugitive frc»a justice or debt; but this can only properly be done before any certificate is granted and not afterwards* To give the negro applicant a certifi- ; ue, wuich in the (iulf carries abnormal oignificance, after the superficial enquiry which as a rule is all that is possible on the part of a iiaval Commander vjho is hore today eina gone tonorrov^ is^ in itself mia- leading, z'or it postulates tlxat the negro is a slave entitled wider Shirley Litcnfi&amp;fcd, U.O. zi.. .o. u Liphin^: u iiu shire •entitled to the benerite of the Brusoels Act; the grant of a certificate with the ianowledge that a few ■Lxoure later it nay be found undeserved and taken away, oe ms to ne open to several objections. xt ggg. g to me that in those o6nfined waters where we have Agents on shore at frequent intervals and tiie Political Lf floor is able in a short time to ascertain for certain the history of any (iulf negro and to pro tect him meanvrhile, there is really no moral need for Lis majesty's ohip lying in harbour to take any acticn at all, beyond passing the applicant on to the juriti^i Officer on shore.

No. I If (e X, TE' Sir, I have the honour to request that you will inform me vrhat procedure you consider should be followed in regard to fugitive slaves who may take refuge on board His Majesty 1 s Ships within Masqat waters* 3. In the 1907 edition of the East Indies Station Orde? Book, Art. 179 directs that the course is to send such slaves to the British Consulate to be dealt with. Art,173, however, lays down that any slave who may take refuse on board one of His Majesty's Ships is to be immediately and definitely freed. Copies of these two articles are attached for convenience of reference. Ihey appear to be somewhat contradictory. Art.173 has been repeated in the 191S edition of the Station Orders (Art.433), but Art.179 has been omitted. 3.
