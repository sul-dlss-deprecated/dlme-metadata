( The principal defect in the 1908 Order which was revealed in the judicial decision in L’gypt, which has been referred to above, was that under Article 15 of the present Order, it seems to be impossible to collect additional Probate fees where the estate hc'8 been undervalued in the original affidavit of the personal representative unless such personal representative makes a corrective affidavit. But it has been thought necessary, in addition to correcting this obvious drafting error, to confer upon the Court expressly/I expressly the powers set out in Articles 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the new draft Order In addition to this, one or two further amendments have been made which seem desirable and Articles 6 and 7 of the 1908 Order have been redrafted, and It is hoped that in their present form they are clearer. The period with regard to dona b io mortis causa has been raised from twelve months to three years and a proviso excepting certain gifts from the operation of the clause has been added in accordance with the amendments of the law effected in England since 1908 o FOREIGN OFFICE, October 11, 1934A Case 62 of 1931 CROftN PKOSKCU TJ R v, CLSAiSNT DWEK &amp; ANOTHER J U D Q If B -K T SIH MICHAEL P 3 J, McOONHELLi Parag Dwek died on the 18th April* 1920 s having hy his will dated 21st January, 1920, appointed Clement Dwek and Gabriel Shama as his executors 0 On the 23rd June, 1920, Clement Dwek swore a declaration for probate purpose© valuing the deceased f s estate at ^58,445ollc4&lt; t On the 24th June, 1920, he paid to the Registrar of HeBoM* Consular Court at Alexandria the Court Probate Pees amounting to £1,755, calculated on such valuation in accordance with the rate prescribed by the First Schedule to the Rules of Court of 1914, item 25, and on the same date a grant of probate was made to him, power to make a similar grant to his co-executor Gabriel Bhama being reserved 8 On the oth August, 1920, Gabriel Shama swore a declaration valuing the deceased's estate at the same figure of £58 j,455t,ll o4 , and probate was granted to him jointly with Clement T &gt;wek 0 On the 7th June, 1927, - almost seven years later - Clement Dwek and Gabriel Shama filed a notice of motion at the registry of H 0 BJI.

On the 4th November, 1932, the present action was tried and Judgment given for the plaintiff-respondent setting aside the order of the 13th June 1927, prom that Judgment the defendant Gabriel Shame appeals. In arriving at a decision in this case it is necessary Jn the first place to consider in detail the relevant provisions of the Foreign Jurisdiction (Probates) Order in Council 1908* Article 5 (1) provides for the affidavit with which the person applying for probate or administration must accompany his application* Article 5 (a) provides for corrections in the original affidavit being made by a further affidavit, to be sworn by the person who applied for the grant of probate or administration* Article 9 provides that the Court may obtain further information, by affidavit or otherwise, regarding the estate from any person, or may direct enquiries concerning it, and then goes on 'the information or report so received shall be 'deemed to be a portion of the affidavit of the applicant for 'probate or letters of administration'. Finally, Article 13 lays it down that where a further affidavit is sworn under Article 5 (2), and the Court is - satisfied either that a larger fee or a smaller fee should have been paid on the grant of probate or administration.vhe Court may direct a further fee to he paid as may he due r or may direct such sum to he repaid to the applicant ae may Beera just. That is to say, it is only when a further affidavit correcting an error in the first affidavit is made hy the person who applied for prohate or administration, and to whom © grant of prohate or administration has issued, that Article 13 comes into operation* To give any other meaning to Article 13 is to reduce the first line of that article to a nullity, and as was said hy Jessell ifUZ-U in Yorkshire Insurance Company v* Clayton (1881), 8 Q a BoD, f at p 0 424, 'Although it may not always be possible to give 'a meaning to every word ueed in an Act of 'Parliament, it is a general rule that it is 'right not to treat words as surplusage if a 'meaning can he fairly given to them'* The same canon of interoretation of course applies also to legislative enactments hy His Ka^esty in Council. By treating the words in Article 13 'where a ’’further affidavit is sworn under Article 5 (2)' as prescribing a condition precedent upon the fulfilment of which alone thfe remainder of the article can be held to operate, we can fairly give a meaning to the article, which, it must not be forgotten, is concerned with the revenues of the Crown and is therefore a legislative instrument which calls for a strict interpretation* This being so, I am hound to hold that Article 13 is not applicable in the circumstances of the present case and that the appeal on behalf of Gabriel Shama must succeed. As the Crown Prosecutor in this case was suing as an officer of the Crown in performance of a public duty f we makemake no order as to costa 0 As to the appeal on behalf of clement Dvek in which we have already held that couneel should not be heard, we order that each party bear ite own costs both here and in the Court below* 20th January p 1933* As._toncosts: Mr. S.

Security in £300, Necessary steps to be taken within 3 months. 20 th January p 1933* SIR H3RBERT C. STRONGE: I concur in the judgment of the President*SIR VASEY STERRY ; I have not much to add but I should like to say a few words. We have had some discussion as to whether the order of the Court in 1917 was a ministerial or a judicial act, and I should like to deal with that point firsto The duties put on the Court under the Foreign Jurisdiction (probates) Order in council in Article 9 seem to resemble duties put on the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under the Finance Act p 1894 s and as there is no provision for the Crown being represented and no suggestion that the Court’s determination under Article 13 is inter partes I still remain of my former opinion that the act of the Court was a ministerial and not a judicial one 0 The next point on which considerable emphasis has been laid by the appellants is that the money sought by the Crown is a fee and not a duty&lt;&gt; I quite agree P though the point comes oddly from the parties who asked the Judge for a return of estate duty and obtained an order for the return of estate duty* The Crown, however, does not press that point, otherwise I should have been inclined to say that the Order and application for repayment were both bad ab Initio * We are then to assume that the case is to be considered on the footing that the application for repayment was for repayment of fees and that the order for repayment related to feeSo Now the importance of this is it is said that no action for return of fees can lie unless there has been some promise to pay and therefore that the Crown here cannot recoverBT— -cover e 1,e i 0:iCe the y have been approved by the Judge, In my view, however true thia may or may not be a 6 an exposition of the law of fees in general, the form of procedure laid down in the Foreign Jurisdiction (Probates) Order in Council necessarily implies a promise to pay on both sides, on the part of the Crown and of the subject. It is assumed in section 13 that the case will arise where too great or too small fees have been paid, and provides for the necessary adjustment, and that though the act of probate for which the fees are paid has been issued. But granted that probate fees are not irrecoverable, is that sufficient in the present case? i ie ave out the question of fraud which has not been alleged, for it ha© not been put higher than a mistake on the part of the Judge in accepting the then present value of the estate instead of the value at the time of Farag iiwek'e death, ihe other members of the Court have discovered a point which was not made to me in the Court below and has escaped the ingenuity of counsel on the appeal, but which appears to me to be irrefutable, it is this that it is by Article IS alone that fees are made repayable, and that that article in terms limits the case to one where a further affidavit has been filed, which seems necessarily to imply that it is by this further affidavit that the Court is to be satisfied, 1 ?here is no power in this Court to correct the wording of Article 13, though it may be -hat there is a draftsman's mistake 0 'There was apparently an attempt to adopt the procedure of the Customs and Inland Sevenue Act, 188*. in these ratters, but under that procedure, if the Commissioners ere satisfied the(*£) the value of an estate ie Insufficient, they can compel the applicant for probate to file a corrective affidavit under aevere penaltiesr This is not the case here.. What is contemplated s so far as the Order in Council lays it down, is, first, the filing of an affidavit£ second, under Article 9 enquiry, if need be, before probate is issued; third, a corrective affidavit; but if once probate has been issued, then the enquiry under Article 9 ie useless, unless the applicant files a further affidavit, or presumably in case of fraudo It might be argued that the report should be considered part of the further affidavit, but Article 9 says distinctly it is to be part of the affidavit, which can only mean the affidavit referred to in Article 5, The result is that I concur with the judgment pronounced by the other members of the Court* 20,1.1933 c</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000366_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3320</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000366</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3320</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 25/16 'Orders-in-Council: Foreign Jurisdiction (Probate) Order-in-Council 1934'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-11-23T22:46:53</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (35 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in chronological order from the back to the front.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 37; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence relating to the drafting and issuing of The Foreign Jurisdiction (Probate) Order in Council, 1935.
