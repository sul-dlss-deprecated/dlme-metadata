On receipt of your letter No.B.G.»5/l of 27th February, I took up the matter with His Highness the Sultan on my next visit to Dhofar in the last week of April. His Highness stated that since there was no evidence forth coming that the area originrlly granted for the Post Office buildings was the some os that shown in the plan for orded by you with your letter of February 27th, 1936, he was unable to permit the enclosure of this ground by a boundary fence as proposed. His Highness declared that he considered the area required woe unnecess orily large but that he would leave the matter in my hands and would authorise the erection of a fence around the Post Office Buildings to enclose ground the amount of which was in my opinion reasonable and unobjectionable from the point of view of not inconveniencing S* 6® M*T— 400 S&amp;P- -{M- 4 S 0 J— 26-7 -£ 4 — 2 , 00 , 000 . the-2 the public. The Sultan promieed to write to his Representative the at Muscat to issue/necessary instructions* Unfortunately His Highness apparently omitted to write any letter as the Muscat authorities declare they have no instructions in the matter and without these they ore unable to give permission for any action to be given* 3. The Sultan is not expected bock in Muscat until October and since it will not be possible to get into communication with him before that dote the question of the fence must be postponed until then. 4. I would point out that your action in giving instructions to the Poet Master to commence work on enclosing on area of ground by a fence before formal sanction was obtained through this Agency from the Sultan was not in order. I am informed that the Post Master actually started the work but the Wali on this being reported to him at once stopped it. The Wali’s action was of course perfectly correct since Muscat is on independent Sovereign State and all matters such os enclosures of any ground or erection of buildings etc by foreign subjects must be formally sanctioned beforexhand by His Highness the Sultan.Telegram, ijnclair.

Subject:- Boundary fencing round the Gwadur post office buiIdings# Sir, r In connection with your interview at my office on the 31st August 1938, on the subject of a boundary fencing round the Gwadur post office buildings, I have the honour to state that in 1935 the Sub Postmaster, G w adur represented that in the absence of a boundary fencing or compound wall round Ihepost office buildings, members of the public be- » sides trespassing used to loiter about the office premises aimlessly. My predecessor who visited Gwadur the same year also recorded that the post office premises should be marked by wire fencing. Accordingly an estinr-t e for a wire fencing was prepared and forwarded to the Sub Postmaster, Gwadur. As no fixed area was recorded as the boundary of the post office buildings, the Sub Postmaster requested that His Hi £hness the Sultan of Muscat should oe approached to fix some boundary, as the v/ali, Gwadur expressed his inability to allow the work to be executed or to do any tiring in the matter until he had received the necessary p ermi ssicn f rom tire Sultan of Muscat. You were therefore addressed on the 27th February 1936 Kindly rirrAh,— p. t. o •kindly to obtain the formal sanction of the Sultan of Muscat for the erection of the boundary fencing. A copy of your reply 'to.753 dated the 23rd July 1936 is attached herewith for your information. From the letter it will be seen that His Hi^iness the Sultan promised to leave necessary instruc tions regarding the fencing but unfortunately left on his [uxopean tour without leaving any instructions ^ith uis representatives at Muscat. From the above letter it will be seen that HisHi^iness the Sultan has left the matter to you for decision regarding the exact area to be bounded^ I therefore request you kindly to do the needful in finally settling this case, as the material for the fencing is lying at iwadur and is likely to become lost if not utilised early. 2. The building at present occupied by the Meteorological office belongs to this Department. It was being used as rest house and has been let to the Meteorological office as a temporary measure until they shift to Jiwani. The fencing was therefore proposed to include also this building within the «( compound.

On receipt of your letter No. B. Gr. 5/1 of 27 th February, I took up the matter with His Highness- the Sultan on my next visit to Ehodar in the last week of April* His Highness stated that since there was no evidence forthcoming that the area originally granted for the post office buildings was the same as that shown in the plan forwarded by you with your letter of February 27th, 19 36, he was unable to permit the enclosure of this ground by a boundary fence as proposed. His Highness declared that he considered the area required was unnecessarily large but that ne would leave the matter in my hands and would authorise the erection of a fence around the post office buildings to enclose ground the amount of which was in my opinion reason able and unobjectionable from the point of view o f not in- con i eniencing the public. The Sultan promised to write to nis Representative at Muscat to issue the necessary instruc tions. Infortunately His Highness apparently omitted to write any letter as the Muscat authorities declare they have no instructions in the matter and without these they are un able to give permission for any action to be given. 3. The Sultan is not expected back in Muscat until October and since it will not be possible to get into communia t ion with him before that fence must be postponed until then. 4. I would p.int out that your action in giving inatruc- tions to the Postmaster to commence work on enclosing an area of ground by a fence before formal sanction was obitained thr 0 ugh feis Agency from the Sultan was not in order.

Sven supposing (for the sake of argument) that he accepted so little as Rs. 10/- per mensem, the additional capital sum would be absorbed in less than four years; and the Posts and Telegraphs Department woulc would then be faced with a continuing liability (as the private purchaser's offer is contingent on his title to the land being guaranteed). I do not think His Highness is likely to be pre 3. pared to sell the land outright, for the reasons given in my first paragraph. Nor can I believe than he would in any case, sell it for as little as Rs. 450/-. I therefore advise th^t the Sultan's offer of bs / 1000/-1,000/- should be accepted, particularly if, a8 you eiy&gt; a heavy bill for repairs may otherwise be anticipated.
