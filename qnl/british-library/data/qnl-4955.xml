I enclose a copy ol' a contract between tne Angl o-Iranian Oil Company and tne Snaikn or Kuwait relating to tne transporta tion of shingle and sand 1'rom Kuwait territory, wnicn was given to me to-day by Hr. H. Gordon, Assistant General Manager oi' tne Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, wno came down rrora Abadan to discuss * various matters witn me. He mentioned tnat early tms year 1 tne Shaikn instructed tne t) orn pa ny * s contractors to cease | transporting sand on tne ground tnat tne area from wnicn it was taken (i.e. Bandar Snuwaikn) was required by tne Kuwait Oil Company. 2. On tne Comp; ny’s Snipping Manager visiting tne Snaikn in February it turned out tnat tnis ground was not required by tne Kuwait Oil Company, and tne ban on tne removal or sand was removed. In the course or an interview wnicn tne Company’s official nad witn tne Snaikn, nowever, tne latter mentioned tnat tne area nad been left very untidy by tne excavations and that ne would like tne Company to rill tnese up. Tne Company nave estimated tne c ost of doing tnis and rind tnat it would come to sometning like £ 20,000/-. Tnere is notning express in tne contract obliging tne Company to fill tne pits, and in a contract of tnis nature I am of opinion tnat tnis obligation could not be read as implied. It seems to me, tnerefore, tnat tnere is sometning benind tne Snaikn’s request. It may be tnat ne merely wisn.es to make trouble with a view to getting better terms on the expiry or tne present contract in May 1939. For tneir part tne Company would like to scrap tne present contract and enter into a fresn one. Gordon tells me tnat ne would like to / Captain G.S.de Gaury, MC. , Political Agent, Ku wait.- 2 - i to visit Ku^vait and interview tne onaiicn and yourseli in tne near future in tne nope or arriving at a settlement witn nis Excellency. He could not give me a definite date and 1 asked nim to communicate witn you direct. 5. Could you please look into tne question generally against ni s arrival witnout, nov/ever, letting tne Snaikn know at tills stage of my opinion tnat ne is not legally entitled on tne contract to require tne Company to rill tne excavations.idiHHlL MSMOIANDTO ACrH^MSNT made between His Excellency 3haikh Ahmed dl Jabar el Jabeh, C.I.E. , Amir of Kuwait, and ANGLO-PER31.AN OtX COMPANY LIMITED (incorporated in Great Britain) hereinafter referred to as 'The Company IN CONSIDERATION of the payment by the Company to His Excellency of the sum of Rs.32,000/- (Rupees Thirty-two thousand), less any sum which may have accrued to him by way of payments firstly in respect of two concessions granted to Haji Ibrahim Bechar i of Basrah, dated 13th May 1937 (? 1927), relating to the transporta tion of shingle and sand from Kuwait territory and the farming of Customs and Manifest dues and secondly in respect of the document, dated 13th August 1927. cancelling those concessions, signed by Haji Ibrahim Bochari and now in the possession of His Excellency, IT IS AGREED AS WVLL073 :- 1.
