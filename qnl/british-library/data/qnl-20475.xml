In Persian territory no pass is required. The snipe shooting is paiticularly good, but a steam launch is al most essential as most of the best places lie some distance away. Shooting is also to be obtained on the Turkish side of the river, for which a pass has to be obta ined. Let not the sportsman be discouraged, however, for the requisite forms may be out of stock in Busrah, when the pass will be granted free. Fishing either with fly, spoon or dead bait is so rarely obtained as to be scarcely worth try ing for, though some Arabs may be seen any day sitting on the bank fishing with the most simple tackle but with only occasional success. Outside Mohammerab one may ride for miles in the desert : except for water channels in a few patches of cultivation there is no jumping. Jack and foxes abound and with a few long dogs (excellent ones are to be obtained in the neighbourhood at very moderate prices) good runs may be obtained with the sporting mem bers of the English community. As regards horseflesh, Jit might naturally be supposed that in a place so close to Busrah, where all Arab ponies are shipped for the Bombay market, well bred ponies were to be obtained, This, however, is not the case. The local Arabs have of recent years neglected the horse breeding for which they were formerly renowned and it is with great difficulty that ponies in any way suitable for the Indian market are to be procured. No description of Mohammerah would be complete without mention of Abacan, a few miles below it on the left bank of Shat-ul- Arab. Here are situated the oil refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company whither the crude oil is conveyed in iron pipes from the wells at Masjid-i-Suleiman, some sixty or seventy miles north west of Ahwaz. This company has obtained from the Persian Govern ment the right to work all oil that may be found in this part of Persia, and though found- edjsome years ago itjhas onlyjrecently extended its export trade outside the Gulf. A visit to the works will well repay the time spent. The European personnel are without exception Scotsmen, the natives, who number over three thousand, include Chinese, Japanese, Arabs, Luris, Bakhtiaris and nearly every class of i ndian. One more item deserves notice, namely, the fact that from Mohammerah will start the Commission which is to demarcate the actual frontier line between Turkey and Persia. It is to be composed of delegates from Britain, Russia, Turkey and Persia, though it is understood that the Russian delegates will not join the Com mission until it has proceeded some distance along the frontier. Several portions of the frontier require exact delimitation but it is in the vicinity of Lake Urumiah that the chief difficulty of the Commissioners will lie. Both Turkey and Persia claim the district under dis pute. which was quite recently the scene of a skirmish between the Turkish and Persian two defects neither of which able.

A COEBESPONDENT.] As Mohamiliemh has lately been attracting a jertain amouat of public attention, possibly 1 few notes oitha place by one who had occa- don recently joispend a few months there may je of interest to your readers. Situated ab^ulGO miles from the bar off the nouth of the Shat-el-Arab and 40 miles from ?ao at its moath, Mohamm )rah is the capital md most iaiBortant town of the province of Arabistan anilies at the junction of the present nain exit of tie Karun and Shat-ul-Arab rivers. Chis exit knowi as the Uaffar Canal (haffar-digj 3 supposed to; have been built by Alexander he Great to avoid sailing down the Karun and ocidentally to open up direct communication vith the Shaflul-Arab. Whether this be true •r not, Alexaader—according to Lord Curzon — ounded one. of his Alexandrias on or tear tha site, of the present town. After lestruction by flood it was successively known ,3 Antiojhia aad Oh irax. j Ardeshir Babahan rebuilt the town in A. D. (35 and changed its name to Astrabad ; when t received its present name is unknown. Some entunes ago when Dizful, Shuster and Ahwaz rare importadt cities, Mohammerah was a port f some renown. LWith the daclinj of these ities, however, it fell into disuse, for early in he present century it was rebuilt by one of the heikhs of tha .Mahaisen tribe of Arabs with he object of resisting Turkish encroachments. &gt;pened a few years later as a free port by one f hissuccassors.tha new port so greatly inter- ared with the trade of Basrah that the Turks ant an expedition and captured it in 1837. t was during, the wars that ensued that the hen ruling Arab chief called to his aid the 'atsians/who ware not then the negligible lilitary quintity that they have siuce become, he Persians in f it made the Arab chief overaor aad reruined in occupation of the &gt;wn, the possession of which was a fruitful rase of dispute bet ween them and the Turks atil 1847 when, thanks to the diplomatic ipport afforded Persia by Russia and Britain, nuohammerah was finally ceded to Persia by the treaty of Erzerum, and with them it has since remained. t Daring the Persian war of 1887 Mohammerah Hfits the scenj of soma fighting. Batteries fpere erected on the north and south banks of the Ilal'far canal and the Britis!! war vessels and transports were subjected to a heavy fire as they proceeded up the river, though with lif.le or no lisutt. A snell from one of the warships fortu- 1)Utely exploded the chief Persian magazine I bout mUday of the 2t)th March, shortly after ■fca disjmbarkatiorf of thj British co.oinenced, B'hich so greatly demoralised them that no ■oonei 1 had the troops fojmad up to Black tham they disappeared. Retreat ing—or rather flying—along the right Rank of the river they took up another Jsition in tha vicinity of Ahwaz, from which a 5w days later in a bloodless encounter 10,000 |f^ersians wore driven by some 300 men of the Mth an 1 7Bth Regiments. Signs of the Bri* Bsh bombardment are still to be seen in jhe deep fm-ro &gt;s on a few of the date- P^lms in the neighbourhood, while some of the ■hell picked up after tha bombardment are to this day used as weights in the main Caravanserai. An island opposite Mohana- erah, where a bittery wa.j posted, is also known as Aaa-ul-Rasas (Mother of Shell). General John Jacob, who accompanied the Persian expedition, in command of the cavalry, strongly urged that Mohammerah, which had bacomo British by right of conquest, should be retained to gether with the province of Khuzistan, or Arabistan as it is now called, which he considered wore of tremendous strategical importance. After a lapse of na arly 60 years it is interest ing to consider what advantages Britain would have derived had his advice been followed and how suprema would have been her influence by the present tima in this neighbourhood which is rapidly becoming of great world interest. It is very many years now since the atten tion of the British was first attracted to the value and possibilities of the Karun trade route, but notwithstanding the repeated efforts of British merchants in conjunction with two Bakhtiari chiefs to obtain concessions for trade on the Karun—the latter unfortunates were either imprisoned or put to death by the Persian Government—no concessions were granted until 1888, In that year the Karun was declared open as far as Bander Nasiri, situated at the rapids some two miles below the town of Ahwaz, whither merchandise after arrival at the for tier place is now conveyed by horse-drawn trams. Messrs Lynch Bros, accordingly inaugurated their steamboat service. Their steamer the Malamir—nimad after a well-known plain in the heart of the Bakhtiari country—does the journey to Nasiri, about 110 miles, in 36-48 hours, depending on the time of year and amount of water in the river, with two iron barges loaded with cargo lashed to either side. Owing to the numerous shoals that are encountered, the steamer anchors for some hours during the night : running aground is frequent and it says much for the Captain's skill and knowledge of the river that the delays are no longer, B'ollowing the opening of the trade route, a British Vice-Consul was ap pointed in 1890, to be raised to the status of Consul a few years later as trade deve loped and the number of British subjects increased. As might be expe cted from the name Arabis tan, tha population of Mohammerah, numbering some4,033 -5.003, exel uding the oil refineries of t!.e Anglo Persian Oil Company at Abadan, is mainly composed of Arabs, The remainder is made up of natives of Dizful and Shuster, a fe*.* merchants from other parts of Persia, Baghdadi Jews and Christians, Mention must also be made of the community of Sabians, some 20 families of whom occupy a small and entirely distinct villaga outside the main town. Many and conflicting reports have been written of this interesting people who style themselves fol lowers of St, John (Mandai Yaheiya), Accord ing to Curzon, they rtcognise St. John the Baptist as their chief prophet, although acknowledging the divinity of God. They have no churches and running water plays an important part in their ritual. The visitor if he is fortunate, may, as he passes the village in his 41 belum,' see one of their baptisms. These baptisms are frequently renewed; marriage and prayer also require running water. In appearance and dress, the Sabians cannot be distinguished from the local Arabs : they intermarry only among them selves, aro smiths by trade and usually in a state of poverty. The Sheikh of Mohammarah, though flying the Persian flag and nominally a Persian sub ject, is virtually independent. He is the chief of the already mentioned Muhaieen Arabs, the majority of whom living on the right bank of the Shat-el-A rab are of course Turkish subjects. His palace at Feilieh on the same river, four to five miles above Mohammerah and quite close to the Perso -Turkish frontier, is an imposing two-sto ried structure fitted with electric light. Here on the King's birthday and the Id he entertains most of the European community at dinner : he also keeps an English speaking doctor, Tha town itself is governed by an official styled the Naib-ul-Hukumeh, who pays the Sheikh a yearly stipend for this privilege. He derives his income from the fines he can extract from malefactors, vaiious rentals and other privileges which are in his giving. Even more important than the above is the Rais-ul-Tujar (chief of the merchants). Him self an enterprising and most successful mer chant, he is the Prime Minister and chief adviser to the Sheikh on all matters relat ing to trade and other allairs. Nor must mention of the Kar ^Guzar (Akram-ul- Mulk) or Foreign Office Agent be omitted. Appointed by the Central Government, his duties are to superintend mercantile oper ations and represent the Persian Foreign Office. Lord Curzon in his Fer&amp;ia mentions having been put to grave inconvenience during his travels in this part of Persia from one of these officials, but at the present time, the posi tion of the KarGuzar is to all intents and pur poses a sinecure. The present holder of the office is a most charming man, who regards his sojourn among the Arabs as little short of exile. Like many Persians he is devoted to gardening and always welcomes Europeans with that charm of manner for which the better class Persians are so justly renowned. As regards the relations between the Arabs and Persians, it is recorded that during the Per sian war of 1857 all the fugitives and wounded Persians that fell into the hands of the Arabs were massacred, British troops alone prevented the camp being looted after the Persians' flight. Relations, though greatly improved since then, cannot even now be termed cordial: the Arabs refer to the Persians as ' Apim ' or Barbarian and regard them as eUeminate, while the Persians regard the Arabs as plotters, Mohammerah may best be reached by B. I, S. N. Company, of which there is a bi-week ly service—fast and slow mail. The former touches only at Muscat and Bushire to pick up mails and passengers, the journey taking five days from Karachi: the latter touches at all the ports on the Gulf, the journey from Karachi taking anything from ten to fourteen days Rarely a week passes without two or more tramp steamers passing Mohammerah, but their arrival and departure is uncertain. The steamer arrives at the mouth of the Shat el- Arab about 12 hours after leaving Bushire. Here it is usually necessary to anchor, for the bar can only be crossed at full tide when there is i8 feet of water. Fao, on the Turkish side of the river, where the cable end of the Gulf section of the In 1o-European Telegraph Com pany comes up, is passed a few miles higher up. Here there has been erected a fort which only diplomatic pressure at Constantinople and the presence of a British warship at Fao pre vented being mounted with guns to become a menace to the shipping. There are no hotels or caravan-serais in Mo- hammerab where travellers may put up, so if a stay is intended previous arrangements should be made. The steamers anchor opposite the junction of the HaEfar Canal, which is here about 600 yards wide and 20 to 30 feet deep. After a medical inspection, the visitor will be taken ashore in a 'belum' as the local boats are called, numbers of which come to meet every steamer on arrival. These are long, narrow craft something like a racing punt and are sailed by a mast and sail or poled or paddled. Most of the European residents have ' bplums ' of their own, hiring local Arabs as ' balumchies ' to pole or paddle the craft. From frequent working together these acquire great dexterity and are only too keen to bet or gamble with the crew of a rival ' bclum ' on tha result of a race—which latter sometimes culminates in a free fight when the most violent language is used and knives are drawn butseldum any blood. Proceedipg up stream are passed the C ustoms House, in the hands of Belgian officials, the ware-houses and offices of the various business firms and the Consulate, which is shortly to be rebuilt. Both in Mohammerah and Ahwaz, the British Consulates are unimposing looking buildings and quite unbefitting tha dignity of a great power like Britain, It is believed that during Lord Curzon's Viceroyalty plans and estimates for more fitting consulates were prepared, to be pigeon-holed on his de parture from India. Considering what British interests are in this neighbourhood and the Eastern respect for pomp and show, it is surely to her interest to provide suitable residences for her Consuls. It is to be,hoped the new Consu late will be on a larger and grander scale. Almost all the firms haveadopted and altered to their requirements Persian houses, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company alone having built a fresh building. This is a fine two storeyed building lighted by electric light as is tha ' English' Club which lies adjacent to it. Mohammerah at the utmost cannot boast more than thirty-five European residents, and it speaks much for the enterprise of these that they have completed a club with tennis and badmington courts and billiard room which can bear comparison with the average up-country Indian one. Passing the club, the next building of any note is the residence of Haji Rais, the Rais-ul- Tujar already mentioned. The town of Mohammerah is next reached. Wiih a river front of half a mile, it stre.chea back into the desert for some three-quarters of Fir almost its entire length the is lined with coffee shops, where in the early morning and again towards limbers, an air a mile, river front sunset the male inhabitants wend their way and, squatting crosswise on the wooden benches sip a cup of tea or coffee, discuss the local news and doubtless criticise the passers-by. The most conspicuous of these coffee shops, and they are quite the feature of Mohammerah, is that frequented by the Jews ; supported on piles it is built out into the river. The bazaar itself hes behind these. Like most bazaars in Persia it is roofed in and is closed for several hours in the middle of tha day. Beyond the making of copper vessels and trays Mohammerah has no special industry like Shiraz, Ispahan or Kirman and the shops are consequently indifferent and uninteresting. A straggling Sabian village is oext passed aid a little later the 'Arsenal' with the arGuzar'a house next to it. The Arsenal consists of fife muzzle-loading guns and with soma barracks in rear, of blight and decay over the whole. What might have formed a quite picturesque picture is spoiled by the wooden structure which has been erected directly in front of the guns : its use may be best left to the imagination. Beyond this lie the residences of the officials of the Imperial Bank of Persia, by far the best buile and most comfortabl e of the European houses. All the above lie on the right bank, with the exception of the quarantine station and oae small village iha left bank is lined with date groves, in the cultivation of which the entire Arab popula tion find employment. These date gardeao' with an occasional crop of wheat or barley grown (beneath the palms, extend about eigh^ miles up the river. The banks of the Shat-ul- Arab are also lined with them from its mouth to some considerable distance above Busrah, I hey form a restful and pleasing contrast to the rest of the surrounding country, which is dead flat, bare and monotonous in the extreme. The traveller who in other parts of the world has seen the value that is made of all available water cannut fail to notice how little use is made of this, the largest and most important of Persian rivers. The already mentioned date groves rarely extend more than a quarter of a mile inland and are irrigated by water channels dug at right angles to the banks of the river, which are filled and emptied at each rise and fall of the tide. Were the most primitive methods of rais ing water to be introduced, large areas of fer tile soil now neglected could easily be brought under cultivation. Remains of abandoned cul tivation prove that a much larger area was formerly under cultivation, but Government oppression ani the enormous percentage of revenue des -anded (sometimes as high as sixty per cent of the crop) have had their natural effect. In any other hands bat those of the Persians the district with its vast natural resources would have been a very different place to what it is at the present day, Mohammerah is also the headquarters of the Persian ISavy or more correctly Customs Preventive Service, which,ccnists of two steam ers and two small yachts fitted with one Or two guns each. The largest of these, the Persepolis, is the flagship of the squadron. Tradition says that it was bought from a Ger man firm, who fitted it with a ram to please the Shah and charged for it accordingly. It is extremely doubtful whether it could put to sea in safety, though the others are more ser- viceabla. A Belgian naval officer is in charge of the squadron and the crew are almost entirely composed of Arabs who make far better seamen than the Persians, which is hardly to be wondered when their former traditions are considered. Much has been written of the climate of the Persian Gulf, Its horrors are a bye-word amongst officers of the East Indies Squadron and British India, Bad it undoubtedly is, but Mohammerah enjoys, and deservedly, the. reputation of having the best climate of these parts. Until the end of July when the south wind commences the climate compares very favourably with that of the averaga Indian plains station. During August and until the middle of September the climate is exces sively damp and trying, while the thermometer records a temperature several degrees higher than that of Bombiy at its worst, Without this wind, however, the district would not have gained the reputation it has of producing the finest dates in the world, for the ripening of the date crop and the arrival of Indian dhows which come for their annual cargo of dates entirely depend upon it. Incidentally, most excellent soles aro to be obtained during these months and form a welcome addition to tha rather indifferent local supplies.THE PIONEER, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1913. Sportsmen will be interested to hear that from the middle of October onwards good snipe, duck, partridge and eandgrouse shooting is to be obtained. In Persian territory no pass is required. The snipe shooting is particularly good, but a steam launch is al most essential as most of the best places lie some distance away. Shooting is also to be obtained on the Turkish side of the river, for which a pass has to be obta ined. Let not the sportsmin be discouraged, however, for the requisite forms may be out of stock in Busrah, when the pass will be granted free. Fishing either with fly, spoon or dead bait is so rarely obtained as to be scarcely worth try ing for, though some Arabs may be seen any day sitting on the bank fishing with the most simple tackle but with only occasional success. Outside Mohammerab one may ride for miles in the desert : except for water channels in a few patches of cultiyation there is no jumping- Jack and foxes abound and with a few long dogs (excellent ones are to be obtained in the neighbourhood at very moderate prices) good runs may be obtained with the sporting mem bers of the English community. As regards horseflesh, Jit might naturally be supposed that in a place so close to Busrah, where all Arab ponies are shipped for the Bombay market, well bred ponies were to be obtained. This, however, is not the case. The local Arabs have of recent years neglected the horse breeding for which they were formerly reno wned and it is with great difficulty that ponies in any way suitable for the Indian market are to be procured. Ho description of Mohammerah would be complete without mention of Abacan, a few miles below it on the left bank of Shat-ul- Arab. Here are situated the oil refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company whither the crude oil is conveyed in iron pipes from the wells at Masjid i-Suleiman, some sixty or seventy miles north west of Ahwaz, This company has obtained from the Persian Govern ment the right to work all oil that may be found in this part of Persia, and though found- ed^some years ago itjbas only|recently extended its export trade outside the Gulf. A visit to the works will well repay the time spent. The European personnel are without exesption Scotsmen, the natives, who number over three thousand, include Chinese, Japanese, Arabs, Luris, Bakhtiaris and nearly every class of 1 ndian. One more item deserves notice, namely, the fact that from Mohammerah will start the Commission which is to demarcate the actual frontier line between Turkey and Persia. It is to be composed of delegates from Britain, Russia, Turkey and Persia, though it is understood that the Russian delegates will not join the Cum mission uutil it has proceeded some distance aloug the frontier. Several portions of the frontier require exact delimitation but it is in the vicinity of Like Urumiah that the chief difficulty of the Commissioners will lie. Both Turkey and Persia claim the district under dis pute. which was quite recently the scene of a skirmish between the Turkish and Persian troops. It is to be hoped that the Commission will prove more successful in their efforts than the previous one which met over a decade ago. Such is Mohammerah at present. And the future ? Surveys of the Mohammerah-Khurma- bad Railway have already been made as far as Shuster—two years at the utmost should see work started on this section. Railways on the North-West Frontier of two defects neither of which are insuper able. Firstly.— The bar at the mouih of the river which, as has already been mentioned, can only be crossed at high tide and now that Turkey has formally handed over to Britain the lighting and policing of the LiLilf, there can be little doubt that dredging operations will be undertaken in the near future and this defect removed. Secondly.—It must be remembered that Turkey owns one and Persia the other bank of the Shat-el-Arab and i n the event of hostilities the between Turkey and Perbia, shipping could be subjected to fire from on e or other of the banks. The contingency is a rem ote one, it is granted, but is worthy of notice, notwith standing the fact that the free navigation of the river has been secured by the Anglo- 'urkish Cbnven tion of July of this year. In any case, an alternative route to the Gulf exists in the channel oftheKarun River it self, both banks of which are in Persian ter ritory. During the war of Ifefj? one of H.M's warships actually used this channel, but it was of very light draught as is proi'ed by the fact that it was able to get over the rapids of Nasiri and reach Ahwaz. Dredging operations on a large scale would therefore be necessary to make this loute practicable. ; It is hoped that sufficient has been said to prove that Mohammerah must expand. This will probably be in a north-westerly direction along the left bank of the Shat-el-Arab when ocean-going steamers will be able to discharge their cargo within a stone's throw of the bank. In the writ r's opinion there is no p'ace in the world that will make greater strides towards prosperity in the near future than this little known spot. UNITED PROVINCES LOCAL RATES. ♦ W e find that the copy of section 8 of the United Provinces Local Rates Bill as supplied to us after its amendment in the course of the Council proceedings on Tuesday was not quite correct. The following is the wording of the section as it finally appears in the Act :— Where a local rate is imposed in Oudh under subsection (I) of clause 3 on any estate, the landlord may rfcover the rate from an under- proprietor or a permanant lessee of land within the estate whose rent has been fixed or record ed by a competent court or frpm a person who holds land comprised in the estate free of rent, in perpetuity, to the following extent, namely, from such under-proprietor or lessee a sum bearing the same proportion to a sum calculat ed at 2^ per cent on the annual value of the land held by him as such annual value after deduction therefrom of the rent so fixed or recorded bears to half such annual value, and from such person a sum equal to 2i per cent on the annual value of the land held by him, and (a) if at the date of the commencement of this Act the rural police rate payable under the United Provinces Local and Rural Police Rates Act, 1906, in respect of such land was wholly recoverable from such under-proprietor, pern^ajtent lessee or person, then from such under-proprietor, permanent lessee or person the whole of the difference between a sum calculated on such annual value at 2J per cent and a sum calculated thereon at the percentage leviable as local rate in respect of the estate, and (b) if at such date the rural police rate was partially recoverable from such under- proprietor, permanent lessee or person, India have, it is almost needless to relate, ^ e u j ' j then from such under-proprietor or permanent lessee a sum bearing the aforesaid proportion had a very civilising effect on the inhabitants of those parts. It is not unnatuial there fore to hope that the building and ultimate opening of this Railway will have the same effect on the umuly Luris and Bakhtiaris, who are at present so great a thorn in the side of the Teheran Government. The Railway will tap an enormous area, naturally rich, which only needs law and order and an assured market for its products to develop into its former prosperity. The trade of this district should increase enormously. A few more years may possibly s* e the Baghdad Railway at Busrah, which should likewise develop, though there is little likelihood of Busrah and Mohammerah in terfering with one another's trade : a glance at the n ap will prove bow entirely distinct are the districts that these Railways will feed. It is, however, quite possible t^at a branch line will be built between the two poits : the distance is only ID miles aiid a line across the desert should present no engineering difficulties. Mohammerah has the natural conditions re quisite for developing into a great port with to such difference, and from such person the whole of such difference.

Messrs Samuel Montagu and Company's silver circular says that the huge specula tions of the Indian Specie Bank have caused much uneasiness for three years past, and the burden of carrying large stocks involved has been exceedingly heavy to those concerned. Negotiations have just been completed whereby the-bank's entire unrealised stock here, both in actual silver and in the form of contracts for forward delivery, have been acquired by a powerful London syndicite.

[48352] No. I. Sir H. Babington Smith to Sir E. Crowe. 50, Cornhill, London, October 23, 1913. D ear S ir E yre, I lir.ve to thank you for your letter of the 6th October, communicating to me, in confidence, an extract from the agreement initialled on the 11th September, between M. Pichon and Djavid Bey, with reference to the ports of Samsoun and Trebizonde. It may be convenient that I should inform you of the present position of this As I stated in my letter of the 10th June, the period for the consideration and settlement of the plans was extended. The new date fixed for the completion of such consideration was the 16th (29th) August, 1913, from which date the period of two months for the option would run. In fact, however, the examination and discussion of the plans was not completed by that date ; and, up to the present time, the Ministry of Public A\ orks, which had suggested certain modifications, has not arrived at any decision as to the exact form which the schemes should assume. We have naturally represented that, until a decision is arrived at by the Government, it is impossible to consider whether we should exercise our option; and that the period of two months for the option should run from the date when the plans are finally settled. This is clearly the intention of article 4 of the preliminary contract. We found, however, considerable reluctance on the part of the Ministry of Public Works to admit this point of view; and we have some reason to think that influences are at work behind the scenes with the object of making our concession The present position is that the Minister of Public Works has asked that engin eers mav be sent to Constantinople to discuss the modifications of the plans, and has undertaken verbally that if this is done at once they will agree that the period of ontion runs for two months from the final settlement of the plans. _ We have replied thatSirJohn Jackson's engineers will start on^ Sunday, the 26th mstant; but that, as the 29th October is the date by which, according to the contention of the Ministry, the ontion must be exercised, we must have a written communication, before the engineers start, in the sense of the Minister's verbal assurances. We are awaiting a reply to a telegram to this efiect, which was despatched on the 21st instant. question. lapse. C610FD126 The attitude of the Ministry of Public Works may be, no doubt, due in part to the belief that the National Bank of Turkey is not likely to take up the concession. You are aware of our general attitude as regards new business m iurkey ; and if the bank alone were concerned, we should not be justified in asking for assistance from the Government. It is, however, a question of works in which an important British firm of contractors—Sir John Jackson (Limited)—is interested ; and, failing the National Bank of Turkey, there can be little doubt that Sir John Jackson would be able to secure financial co-operation from other quarters. We are anxious to en sure that Sir John Jackson's interests shall not suffer by our withdrawal; and, if circumstances should require it, I hope that we may have Sir Edward Grey's sup port in claiming that the concession should not be allowed to lapse through an un reasonable interpretation of the option clause.

With reference to my despatch No. 45 of the 31st July last, I have the honour to report that the branch line of the Baghdad Railway Company from Toprak-kaleh to Alexandretta will probably be opened to traffic next month (November). With regard to the contemplated branch line from Ulu Kishla via Kaisarieh to Sivas, it is stated that Ulu Kishla is favoured as the point of junction by the Turkish Government, while the railway company would prefer a point further west, Chai-han, between Ulu Kishla and Konia being mentioned in this connection. It is stated that great natural difficulties exist between Ulu Kishla and Kaisarieh, and the rail way company are doubtless also influenced by a desire to have the junction as near the port of Haidar Pasha as possible. I learn that surveys and studies will shortly be undertaken to the north of Diarbekir, in the direction of Sivas. It is stated that information is required res pecting the route of the branch line from El Halif via Mardin to Diarbekir, and for a contemplated extension md Kharput and the Dersim to Sivas.127 (Received on the 8th December 1913, with Political Secretary's letter No. 47, dated the 21st November 1913.)

[November 7.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [50643] No. 1. Hen von Kilhlmann to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 7.) (Confidential.) German Embassy, London, November 3, 1913. Dear Sir Edward, The counter-draft to the British draft of the 18th September 1913, which I had the honour to submit to-day, might require some confidential explanations, which I shall attempt to give in the following :— In article 1, clause (a), we would prefer to say in the seventh line * e construc tion of the Baghdad Railway system,'' because that would cover the main line and the branch lines granted by the concession, as they shall be finally settled between the German and Turkish Governments. The word ' Railvay ' at the beginning of the ninth line of the English counter-draft to be replaced by '' Undertaking.'' We would like the last part of article I, beginning with ' under ' and ending with '' this clause,' to be transferred to the note explicative. Our legal advisers IS, do not hold the opinion that by accepting this clause England would bind herself , , g to support any future increase of Turkish customs because an increase might seem desirable in the interest of the Baghdad Railway, but we consider at the same time that it would, as would the spirit of this convention, prevent England from opposing existing revenue or increases of the customs, ir principle already accept ed by the Powers, being in part used for the Baghdad R&amp;ilwiy. In clause (b), ' declare that they will not oppose ' might be replaced by agree to.' Clause (c). The Imperial Government is quite willing to use its influence to see that British capital should be admitted to the Baghdad Railway Company under fair and reasonable terms. The clause would then read as follows :—• thenoit^ ' The Imperial German Government declare that they will use their best endeavours to secure that two British directors agreeable to His Britannic Majesty's Government shall be admitted as representatives of a group of British shareholders to the Board of the Baghdad Railway Company.' %128 The Imperial Government is of opinion that this clause might be left out altoffether if a group of British shareholders can be formed before the signature nf this aareement As for the election of the British directors, I am glad to see Itthe'a^gemei suggested in Prince Lichnowsky's note are satisfactory to His Majesty's Government. The German Government considers that clause (c), article 1, in its amended form should better be left out of the convention and put m the note explicative. If however His Majesty's Government could not agree to this, but insisted on retaining this clause in the convention, the Imperial Government would agree to this provided the second section of clause (c), article 2, which, according to Prince Lichnowsky's note of the 16th July 1913, was to be put m the note expli cative, would he restored to the text of the convention. The prospects laid by Herr von Gwinner befbre Sir H. Babington Smith on the 14th June 1913, were, to use a financial expression, ground-floor terms as favourable as could be offered at that period. The Baghdad Kailway Company will try to obtain from the Turkish Government more favourable terms. Any concession which they might be able to secure will be offeied as a matter of course to the British group. In article 2, clause {d), the words ' c 50 per cent.' should be replaced by 4 ' not less than 20 per cent.' What Prince Lichnowsky said about our willingness to agree to a British participation of 40 per cent, is entirely maintained , but the Imperial Govern ment attaches the greatest importance to this particular wording, and I would strongly recommend its acceptance. The last paragraph beginning with ' 4 any '' and ending with 4 ' commission •' could be left out. It is contained in the Anglo-Turkish _ Convention, and will be confirmed in the agreement between the Baghdad Kailway Company and the Turkish Government. In article 3, clause (c), the Imperial Government would like to see the words '' within the provinces of Mosul and Baghdad '' replaced by '' in Ottoman territory east of Aleppo,' and after ' Baghdad Railway Company's lines ' inter polated'or in contradiction with that Company's existing rights.' The first alteration is based on the belief that the wording proposed in the British counter-diaft would not sufficiently protect the Baghdad Railway in terests against the possibility of a competing line from some point of the Medi terranean to Lower Mesopotamia being supported by His Majesty's Government. It is hoped that the plan of constructing a line from Aleppo to Meskene can be successfully dealt with during the Franco-German negotiations about railways in Asia Minor. Article 4, clause {h), asks for a 20 per cent, participation in the shares of the River Navigation Company. This is the irreducible minimum we must ask for, and nothing less, but this participation could , in the opinion of the Imperial Govern ment, lead to a successful conclusion of this agreement. The German Govern ment lays great stress on the wording proposed, which establishes some sort of parallelism with clause (d), article 2, but it is at the same time understood that the wording does not mean to establish any claim beyond the 20 per cent, share we ask for. This 20 per cent, share is meant to represent a permanent proportion of the share capital, so that in case of future changes in the capitalisation this pro portion shall always be maintained. In article 4, clause (c), we propose to strike out the words beginning with ' not continue ' till 'case they shall.' The Baghdad Railway interests are quite willing to let their transport privi leges on the river lapse after the completion of the main line to Basra, but do not see their way to agree to a fixed time limit, as proposed in the British counter- draft. It is hoped, however, that some arrangement, as contemplated in the last section of clause (c), might be ^ concluded before the signature of this convention, rendering the proposed time lin it altogether unnecessary.1 -sSSSJ 1 129 In article 5, clause {h), it is proposed to insert after f&lt; to use ' the words fi at their stations on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates and.' We propose to restore the contents of our former article 5 as article 5 A, or clause (c) of article 5, British counter-draft, in the wording of our counter-proposal. In view of the paramount importance which the Shatt-el-Arab has for our interests, being the only access by sea to the terminus of the great railway in which so much capital has been sunk, it is necessary for us to have a direct assurance from His Majesty's Government that the river will be kept in good conservancy and open under terms of absolute equality. In article 6 we agree to the first section, but would like a clause added expressly stating that the rights acquired by the capitulations, shall not be im paired. The Imperial Government thinks that the machinery provided by the second section of article 6 is open to a good deal of criticism, and proposes, if their original article 6 should be accepted, striking out the words from the 'Shatt-el-Arab shall'' to ' of Basra and '. Turkey has not ratified The Hague Convention of the 18th October 1907. There does not seem, therefore, to be any real guarantee that the British Government would in every case succeed in making the Turkish Govern ment accept the reference to a Commission of Enquiry, as proposed in the British counter-draft. Such a Commission seems in the opinion of the German Govern ment a rather clumsy instrument and probably there would be a good deal of delay before any decision could be arrived at. The decision of the Commission would in no way have the character of an arbitral decision or any binding charac ter whatsoever. The decision leaves, as stated in article 35 of The Hague Convention, absolute liberty to the parties concerned. It seems, therefore, that if after protracted negotiations the Commission of Enquiry should give a decision unfavourable to the Commission, there would be under the scheme as it stands now no guarantee whatever that the Riverain Commission either changes the objectionable policy or is replaced by a body better adapted for the needs of commerce and navigation. The Imperial Government for the same reasons that have led to ask for the retention of article 5 A attaches great importance to get a direct undertaking from His Majesty's Government concerning dues on the Shatt-el-Arab. P The desire to retain the second part of our article 6 beginning with '' That dues shall '' has no doubt contributed to the desire to let our article 6 stand as proposed by us. Therefore, it seems advisable in case the retention of our article 6 should not be agreed to, to attach its second part to article 5 A. In article 7 the Imperial Government agrees to the proposal of the British counter-draft, but would like to see clause (d) retained in a form given in our counter-draft. Article 8 is agreed to. Believe me, etc. KUHLMANN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum.

Such launches shall not exceed tons British measurement. Article 5 A, His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Imperial German Government will use their best endeavours to secure that the Shatt-el-Arab shall be brought into and permanently kept in a satisfactory state of conservancy in order that sea going vessels may always be assured of free and easy access to the port of Basra, and to secure, further, that the navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab shall permanently be kept open for sea-going vessels, and be carried on on terms of absolute equality for the vessels of all nations, without regard either to the nationality of the vessels or to their cargoes.

The Imperial Govermnent are ready, by means of an exchange of notes, to declare as follows : The Baghdad Railway Company have assured the Imperial Govern ment that all rates of freight and conditions of transport shall be duly (•' ange- messen ') published, and the same with every change proposed therein ; further, that any change in these conditions or rates of freight, both increases and decreases, shall be published at least two months before they come into force.

Revised Draft by Mr. Hurst of Article6 A eticle 6. The Imperial German Government having taken note of the Anglo-Turkish ±ne under which the free navi- sationof the &lt; Shatt-el-Arab' &gt; is assured to the shipping of all nations and a commission fs established for the execution of such works as may be necessary for the improve ment of its channel and for its maintenance and for other like purposes set out therein and being of opinion that the provisions of the Convention are conducive to the best interests of international commerce, will, so long as the duties imposed unon the Commission by the said Convention are satisfactorily carried out uphold the Convention, and will undertake that German subjects and German shipping shall comply therewith, and with all regulations issued by the Commission, and shall duly discharge all obligations properly imposed upon them in pursuance of the provisions of the said Convention. The Imperial German Government take note in this connection of the declara tion, signed on the 21st of October 1913 and attached to the said Convention, to the effect that articles 7 and 8 of the above Convention do not affect the rights enjoyed in the Ottoman Empire by the nationals of the Treaty Powers. His Britannic Majesty's Government on their part undertake that they will not, without a preliminary agreement with the Imperial German Government, consent to the imposition of dues exceeding 1 franc per registered ton. If at any time the Imperial German Government are of opinion that the duties imposed upon the Commission are not satisfactorily carried out, or that the reason able requirements of the commerce of the river in matters within the competence of the Commission are not adequately met, and if the Commission in such case has not seen its way to give effect to important recommendations laid before it in the interests of German shipping, with the object of removing the above -mentioned causes of complaint, His Britannic Majesty's Government will use their good offices with the Imperial Ottoman Government to ensure the reference of the questions whether in any particular respects the duties of the Commission have not been satisfactorily carried out, and whether there is good ground for thinking that the Commission, if maintained, will not be able to provide for the reasonable require ments of the commerce of the river to a Commission of Enquiry.T 139 This Commission shall consist of three members, one of whom shall be appointed by the Impeiial Ottoman Government, one by His Britannic Majesty's Government, and one by the Imperial German Govern ment. The member appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government shall be Alternative. This Commission shall consist of five mem bers to be drawn from the Powers most inter ested by reason of the magnitude of their ship ping in the Shatt-el-Arab; the Ottoman mem ber of this Commission shall be the President. the President. The procedure to be followed in the investigation of the questions referred to the Commission shall be determined by the Commission itself, but, subject thereto, shall be in general accordance with that followed by Commissions of Enquiry ap- oointed under the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. The Commission of Enquiry shall, unless the time is extended with the consent of all parties, publish its report within six months of its appointment. The Govern ment of His Britannic Majesty wi 1 ! use their good offices with the Imperial Ottoman Government to ensure that the proposals contained in such Repoit are carried out.

Sir, With refeience to my letter No. 51887 of the 15th instant, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a communica tion from the German Charge d'Affaires, enclosing the German counter-diaft of the proposed Anglo-German Convention respecting the Baghdad Eailway a ad cognate, matters. Sir E. Grey considers that it would be convenient if the German reply and the proposed agreement between the Ottoman Government and the Baghdad Railway Company were discussed at a conference of representatives of the Board of Trade and India Office, and he would suggest that the conference should take place at the Board of Trade, if possible, this week. Mr. Clerk and Mr. Parker would represent the Foreign Office. He further consideis that the negotiations with Herr von Kiihlmann should now be conducted orally as far as possible, with a view to expedition. I am to add that, subject to any recommendations which may be made by the proposed inter-departmental conference, Sir E. Grey is in substantial agreement with the marginal minute printed on the enclosed paper ; he would, however, deprecate an explanatory note, as he is of opinion that the convention itself ought to be so clear and precise as to require no explanation, and such a note as proposed would only have sense if it were in the nature of further stipulations not to be pub lished. He entertains strong objections to any secret stipulations. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) EYRE A. CROWE. The Under Secretary of State, India Office.140 [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABTA. CONFIDENTIAL. [50643] No. 1. JJerr von Kuhlmunn to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 7), (Confidential). German Embassy, London, November 3,1913. Dear Sir Edward, The counter-draft to the British draft of the 18th September 1913, which I had the honour to submit to day, might require some confidential explanations, which I shall attempt to give in the following :—■ In article 1, clause {a), we would prefer to say in the seventh line ' con struction of the Baghdad Railway sys tem,' because that would cover the main line and the branch lines grant ed by the concession, as they shall be finally settled between the German and Turkish Governments. The word ' Railway' at the beginning of the ninth line of the English counter-draft to be replaced by ' Undertaking.' We would like the last part of arti' cle 1, beginning with 'under' and ending with ' this clause,' to be trans ferred to the note explicative. Our legal advisers do not hold the opinion that by accepting this clause England would bind herself to support any fu ture increase of Turkish customs be cause an increase might seem desirable in the interest of the Baghdad Railway, but we consider at the same time that it would, as would the spirit of this con vention prevent England from oppos ing existing revenue or increases of the customs, in principle already accepted by the Powers, being in part used for tne Baghdad Railway. In clause (6), ' declare that they will not oppose ' might be replaced by ' agree to.' Clause (c). The Imperial Govern ment is quite willing to use its influence [November.] Section 7. Minute hy Mr. Parker. Provided it is expressly agreed, per haps in the note explicative referred to by Herr von Kiihlmann, that the drafting of article 1, clause {a), does not in advance preclude His Majesty's Government from opposing future variations of the con cession, and provided His Majesty's Government are furnished with authen tic copies of all existing agreements bet ween the Ottoman Government and the Germans, including the modifications now under discussion with Djavid Bey, I do not think exception need be taken to the words ' system ' and ' under taking.' It is, however, essential that His Majesty's Government should know precisely what they are asked to agree to. There does not seem the same objec tion to leaving out these words from the convention if they are inserted in the note explicative, which might advantage ously define their somewhat ambiguous meaning. I think this is an improved wording in which His Majesty's Government might certainly concur.s The original idea of securing the ap pointment of two British directors was to guard against discrimination in rates; subsequently the German Government pointed out that in practice this could only be arranged by such directors representing British shareholders, and to this His Majesty's Government agreed. I am, however, doubtful as to whether this text should be adopted. The words 4 ' as representatives of a group of British shareholders ' appearing in the body of the convention appear to lend the official support of His Majesty's Government to active British participation in the Bag dad Railway—and such an attitude might, in view of the past history of the question, be difficult to defend. It is indeed matter for consideration whether, as the German Government suggest, clause (c) of article 1 should not be left out of the convention and put in the note explicative. As very great im portance is not, I believe, attached by the Board of Trade to the appointment of British directors at all (so far as dis crimination against British trade is con cerned) it might be best to omit all men tion of such appointments even in the note explicative, thus leaving it open to British financiers to participate on their own terms as regards representation on the board. Thit would enable us to resist the German claim as embodied in the last paragraph of article 2, clause (c), and its insertion either in the con vention or in the note explicative; that claim is one which the India Office are anxious should be resisted. The expression ' ground-floor terms ' can seldom have been so flagrantly mis applied. Herr von Gwinner proposed to Sir H. Br.bington, Smith, as regards Bri tish participation, terms far less ^' v ® ur ' able than those conceded to the Bagdad Railway Company by their convention of 1903. It was this which prompted the remr.rks in the British note of 18th Sep tember, and in the reply these considera tions should be emphasised. At the same time it is true that, owing to the war and other causes, the 1903 concession is finan cially less attractive than it was at the date of signature. Instead of 50 per cent, in the port of Basra, we are offered ' not less than 20 percent.,' which includes participation c610fd 141 to see that British capital should be admitted to the Bagdad Railway Company under fair and reasonable terms. The clause would then read as follows ;— ' The Imperial German Govern ment declare that they will use their best endeavours to secure that two British directors agreeable to His Bri tannic Majesty's Government shall be admitted as representatives of a group of British shareholders to the Board of the Bagdad Railway Company.' The Imperial Government is of opi nion that this clause might be left out altogether if a group of British share holders can be formed before the sig nature of this agreement. As for the election of the British directors, I am glad to see that the arrangements sug gested in Prince Lichnowsky's note are satisfactory to His Majesty's Gov ernment. The German Government considers that clause (c), article 1, in its amended form should better be left out of the convention and put in the note ex plicative. If, however, His Majesty's Government could not agree to this, but insisted on retaining this clause in the convention, the Imperial Govern ment would agree to this, provided the second section of clause (c), article 2, which, according to Pr nee Lich nowsky's note of the 16th July, 1913, was to be put in the note explicative, would be restored to the text of the convention. The prospects laid by Herr von Gwinner before Sir H. Rabington Smith on the 14th June, 1913, were, to use a financial expression, ground- floor terms as favourable as could be offered at that period. The Bagdad Railway Company will try to obtain from the Turkish Government more favourable terms. Any concession which they might be able to secure will be offered as a matter of course to the British group. In article 2, clause {d), the words ' 50 per cent.' should be replaced by ' not less than 20 per cent.' *142 What Prince Lichnowsky said about in' the eonstruction contracts ' if any.' VVnat rrmce ijiouu y „ expression not less than 20 per our willingness to agree tirely cen t.' is retained merely to confuse the participation of pe ^ Gov _ Gerinan public into believing that there maintained, bu e j eatest i m - is a parallel between article 2, clause (i), portance hiT particSar lording. and Lticle 4, clause (6) but it is explain- ana I would Strongly recommend ed that Germany is still willing in point ana i wuuka &amp; j ^ {act to | et us have 40 per cent. His its acceptance. Majesty's Government gave good rea sons for asking for a 50 per cent, parti cipation in their note of the 18th Sep tember. If now His Majesty's Govern ment agree to 40 per cent, they might well only do so on condition of British participation in the port of Bagdad as well as in that of Basra. Lord Inch- cape considered participation in Bagdad valueless ; but the point merits fresh con sideration as opportunity for such parti cipation now arise .3 again, and in any case His Majesty's Government should stipulate against discrimination as between vessels of different nationality at the railway port of Bagdad. The last paragraph beginning with It is true that this is not primarily a ' any ' and ending with ' commis- ™tter for an Ang o-German convention ; sion could be left out. It is con- but there is, nevertheless, some advantage tained in the Anglo-Turkish Conven- m securing the German Government s tion, and will be confirmed in the agree- assent to sue a s 'pu a ' ori a ^ n or 18 ment between the Bagdad Railway reason ^ seems we o re am i . Company and the Turkish Govern ment. In article 3, clause (c), the Imperial ^ no ^ ye can safely agree to Government would like to see the g eo g ra pl llca ^ definition, even if the words ' within the provinces of Mosul Aleppo-Meskene question is settled. We and Bagdad ' replaced by 'in Otto- could hardl y mortgage the future as re man territory east of Aleppo,' and g ar( I s an y ^ ne f r( &gt;m the ^Mediterranean after ' Bagdad Railway Company's to Lower Mesopotamia ; and, as it is, 1 lines ' interpolated or ' in contradic- think we should attacl1 to the tion with that Company's existing tion a map showing the limits of Bagdad rights.' &amp; ?

It is hoped that the plan of constructing a line from Aleppo to Meskene can be suc cessfully dealt with during the Franco- German negotiations about railways in Asia Minor. Article 4, clause (b), asks for a 20 per cent, participation in the shares of the River Navigation Company. I his is the irreducible minimum we must ask for, and nothing less but As 20 per cent, is the maximum we could agree to as regards German parti cipation in the river navigation [article 4, clause (6)] it seems undersirable and indeed deceitful to adopt the wordingI 143 'not less than' with regard to such participation. It would ultimately have to be explained in Parliament what the real understanding was, and it thus seems useless to adopt a wording which is not straightforward in the convention. Herr Zimmermann is, I understand, the devoted parent ot this ridiculous ' paral lelism'. It is of great importance that we should secure a time limit j but it seems that we should now first aim at an arrange ment as contemplated in the last para graph of article 4 (c), and that negotia tions to this end should be hastened. This proposed addition goes beyond anything conceded in the Baghdad Rail way Convention of 1903, and, from the wording (as read to me by Hakki Pasha), of a draft agreement between the Com pany and the Ottoman Government, it is evidently the aim of the Company to secure thereby rather extensive rights of navigation. I think the limits of such navigation rights, if conceded, should be carefully restricted, and possibly the services in question might be performed by Lord Inchcape's Company in which the Germans are to participate. His Majesty's Government might pos sibly undertake to use their best endea vours to this end, but it is considered objectionable to admit the German Gov ernment to any share of responsibility. The ' recommendations ' made at the informal conference of the 9th Septem ber 1913, might be the interpretation of this article, and might be embodied in an annex to this convention. this participation could, in the opi nion of the Imperial Government, lead to a successful conclusion of this agreement. The German Govern ment lays great stress on the wording proposed, which establishes some sort of parallelism with clause {d), article 2, but it is at the same time under stood that the wording does not mean to establish any claim beyond the 20 per cent, share we ask for. This 20 per cent, share is meant to represent a permanent proportion of the share capital, so that in case of future changes in the capitalisation this proportion shall always be maintained. In article 4, clause (c), we propose to strike out the words beginning with *' not continue ' till ' case they shall.' The Baghdad Railway interests are willing to let their transport privileges on the river lapse after the comple tion of the main line to Basra, but do not see their way to agree to a fixed time limit, as proposed in the British counter-draft. It is hoped, how ever, that some arrangement, as con templated in the last section of clause (c), might be concluded before the signature of this convention, rendering the proposed time limit altogether un necessary. In article 5, clause (6), it is proposed to insert after 'to use ' the words ' at their stations on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates and. ' We propose to restore the contents of our former article 5 as article 5-A^ or clause (c) of article 5, British counter-draft, in the wording of our counter-proposal. In view of the para mount importance which the Shatt-el- Arabhas for our interests, being the only access by sea to the terminus of the great railway in which so much capital has been sunk, it is neces sary for us to have a direct assurance from His Majesty's Government that the river will be kept in good conser vancy and open under terms of abso lute equality.144 In article 6 we agree to the fi rs ^ sec ' tion, but would like a clause added ex pressly stating that the rights, acquired by the capitulations, shall not be im paired. The Imperial Government thinks that the machinery provided by the second section of article 6 is open to a good deal of criticism, and proposes, if their original article 6 should be accep ted, striking out the words from the ' Shatt-el-Arab shall' to ' of Basra and.' Turkey has not ratified The Hague Convention of the 18th October 1907. There does not seem, therefore, to be any real guarantee that the Bri tish Government would in every case succeed in making the Turkish Gov ernment accept the reference to a Com mission of Enquiry, as proposed in the British counter-draft. Such a Commission seems, in the opinion of the German Government, a rather clumsy instrument, and probably there would be a good deal of delay before any decision could be arrived at. The decision of the Commission would in no way have the character of an arbi tral decision or any binding character whatsoever. The decision leaves, as stated in article 35 of The Hague Convention, absolute liberty to the parties concerned. It seems, therefore, that if after protracted negotiations the Commission of Enquiry should give a decision unfavourable to the Commission, there would be under the scheme as it stands now no guaran tee whatever that the Riverain Com mission either changes the objec tionable policy or is replaced by a body better adapted for the needs of commerce and navigation. The Im perial Government, for the same reasons that have led to ask for the retention of article 5-A, attaches great importance to get a direct undertak ing from His Majesty's Government concerning dues on the Shatt-el- Arab. The desire to retain the second part of our article 6 beginning with '' That dues shall '' has no doubt contributed to the desire to let our article 6 stand as proposed by us. Therefore, it seems advisable, in case the retention of our article 6 should not be agreed to, This may, subject to any observations of the Legal Adviser, be agreed to as it is covered by the additional convention signed by Hakki Pasha on the 2lBt Oc tober. Possiblv the words in no other res pects ' should be substituted for ' in no wise.' From oral explanations of Herr von Kiihlmann it is understood that^ he per sonally is strongly opposed to a ' comite de surveillance,' which, he recognises, would be unsatisfactory in practice. It seems therefore advisable to concentrate on the improvement of article 6 of the British draft so as to meet the German criticisms as here expressed. Perhaps Mr. Hurst would suggest an amended wording. This should be considered in the light of articles 11 and 16 of the Anglo-Turkish Shatt-el-Arab Convention of the 29th July 1913.mZm0m mm 145 to attach its second part to article 5-A. Article 7 seems very objectionable. let. [Herr von Kiihlmann stated that our request (see note covering our draft of ISth September) concerning the Smyrna- Aidin Railway was under consideration at Berlin, and it was hoped a favourable settlement would be reached.] I venture to suggest that the most expeditious way of dealing with the German proposals would be for them to be sent, with this minute, to the India Office and Board of Trade with the suggestion that a conference should meet early next week to discuss the nature of the reply. It is important to conclude the agreement as soon as pos sible. A. r. Foreign Office, November 11, 1913. In article 7 the Imperial Gov ernment agree to the proposal of the British counter-draft, but would like to see clause {d) retained in a form given in our counter-draft. Article 8 is agreed to.

Foreign Office, 22nd November 1913. Cofy. Immediate and Confidential. No. 52549-13. - Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 14th instant in which you state that, as the negotiations between Germany, Great Britain and Turkey relative to the Bagdad Railway are to form one whole, and as it appears highly desirable that the arrangements incorporated in the different treaties and conventions should exactly correspond, it seems expedient for the present merely to initial the agreements with the Turkish Government, in order that it may be easier to insert any necessary alterations in order to bring about complete confor mity. You add that, for this reason, the German Government will for the present only initial the agreements to be concluded with Djavid Bey at Berlin. In conveying to you the thanks of His Majesty's Government for this com munication, I have to inform you that the agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Ottoman Government relating to railways in Asiatic Turkey will not be signed yet; but the agreements relating to the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Concession and to the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Commission were, /153 as I have already informed His Highness the German Ambassador privately, signed some months ago. In accordance, however, with the semi-official statement which His Highness made some time ago, that the German Government would regard it as very con ciliatory if His Majesty's Government did not publish their agreements with Turkey pending the conclusion of the Anglo-German agreement, His Majesty's Government will defer such publication for some weeks, though they desire to lay papers before Parliament reassembles, and they therefore trust that all the agree ments may be concluded before December 31st, 1913. I have to state further that His Majesty's Government are in full agreement with the German Government as to the importance of complete concordance, and they are also of opinion that any agreements now under discussion with Djavld Bey or Hakki Pasha in which the three Powers, Germany, Turkey, and Great Britain, are interested, should be merely initialled pending direct discussion between Germany and Great Britain. In conclusion, I have to add that I hope to furnish you at an early date with the observations of His Majesty's Government on the German counter-draft, which you were good enough to communicate to this Department, of the proposed agreement between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Eailway Company. I have the honour to be. With high consideration, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant (for Sir E. GEEY), EYRE A. CROWE. Herr von Kuhlmann, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Translation.

In conformity with my instruc tions I have to-day communicated to the proper Department in the Foreign Office a copy of the counter proposals which the Imperial Government desire to put forward in connexion with these declarations. As the negotiations relative to the Bagdad Railway between Germany, England, and Turkey are to form one whole and as it appears highly desirable that the arrangements incorporated in the different treaties and conventions should exactly correspond, it seems expedient for the present merely to intial the agreements with the Turkish Government in order that it may be easier to insert any necessary alterations in o^der to bring about complete conformity. For this reason the Imperial Government will for the present only initial the agreements to be concluded at Berlin with Djavid Bey. I have, &amp;c., (Sd.) KUHLMANN. His Exeellency Sir E.

In reply I am to state that in the opinion of the Board the undertaking now offered by the German Government is of a satisfactory nature and to suggest that, should Sir E.

Enclosures in Foreign Office covering letter dated 24th November 1913. Board of Trade, Gwydyr House, Whitehall , S. W., (52480) November 17 th, 1913. My dear Parker, You mentioned to me some little time ago the possibility of discrimination in respect of railway rates in favour of goods carried by rail from Bussorah to places north of Baghdad, as against goods carried by water to Baghdad and there put on rail for conveyance northward ; and enquired if the Board of Trade thought it possible to introduce into the Anglo-Turkish or the Anglo-German agreement any provision to prevent such discrimination. I write now to say that, after very careful consideration and consultation with our Railway Department, it does not appear to us to be possible for His Majesty's Government to take any action in this matter. The purpose of the provisions as to rates introduced into the agreements referred to above is to insure British goods against discrimination of any sort, not to protect the river companies against railway competition. Differentiation of the kind contemplated is a not uncommon feature of traffic competition, and it would be scarcely possible to argue that it is unreasonable or ' unfair '. And it would be very difficult to frame a provision directed against such differentiation, which could be defended in argument. The point was not overlooked when the articles in the agreements were being drafted, but the rather vague provisions of Article 4 as in the Anglo-Turkish Con vention seemed to be the best we could devise as protection against unfair dis crimination of any kind. Yours very truly, (Sd.) PERCY ASHLEY.155 156 Copy (52623). Hakki Pasha said to me to-day that the great difficulty in the river conces sion was the desired stipulation as to the British and Turkish members of the Board votins in block, should Lord Inchcape so decide. He said the necessity for such an arrangement appeared to rest entirely upon the danger of Mr. Lynch acting m an unpatriotic manner, and the obvious solution was, if this were so, the exclusion of Mr. Lynch. In any case he had done nothing but intrigue for months, and he would be a constant element of trouble on the Board of the new company, hinder ing its working at every turn. Mr. Lynch was an Armenian and, as he had remark ed to me before, an Armenian differed from a Jew in that he went on intriguing even when it was to his own detriment to do so. Surely Mr. Lynch had forfeited all claim to the support of His Majesty's Government by his recent misconduct Hakki Pasha was convinced, though he could not of course say so ottLcially, that Mr Lynch had for months been intriguing against the concession through some agent at Constantinople, and that the delay in signing the concession and the difficulties which were now being created, were largely due to Mr. Lynch, who no doubt had relations with minor officials in the Ministry of Public W orks. I told Hakki Pasha that Mr. Lynch was now at Constantinople, and he replied that he supposed he had gone there as his attempt to get at Tewfik Pasha through the Persian Minister in London had failed. I asked him if he could find out what Mr. Lynch was doing at Constantinople, and he said he would send a telegram asking what business he was discussing, and would let me know the result. Lord Inchcape tells me that even if Mr. Lynch goes out voting in block must be retained. I was not able to pursue this to-night, but I will ask Lord Inchcape the exact reason when I see him on Friday. I am to have a further meeting with Hakki Pasha about the navigation conces sion to-morrow morning and one with Hakki Pasha and Lord Inchcape on Friday. Meanwhile, until we hear more as to what Mr. Lynch is doing in Constantin ople, no action with regard to him seems possible. Mr. Slaughter, his solicitor, k very much annoyed at his having gone, as he advised him emphatically not to go, as the visit would certainly be liable to misconstruction. (Initialled) A. P.

Section 1. [53422] No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to German Charge d'Afjaires. Sir E. Grey presents his compliments to the German Charge d'Affaires, and, with reference to the draft, communicated by Herr von Kuhlmann on the 14th November, of the proposed agreement between the Baghdad Railway Company and the Ottoman Government, has the honour to transmit the accompanying counter- draft, which, in so far as British interests are concerned, appears to His Majesty's Government to meet the requirements of the situation. A sentence has been added to article 1 so as to bring that article into accord with the corresponding stipulation in the Anglo-German draft. No changes are made in articles 2 and 3. Article 4, as drawn in the German draft, is impossible of being carried into execution. In the first place, a vessel drawing 24 feet would require a depth of159 considerably over 24 feet in the river ; in the second place, a;; the depth on the bai of the Shatt-el-Arab is, as explained in Sir E. Grey's memorandum of the 23rd August, only 11 feet at low water springs, a depth of 24 feet over the bar cannot be attained except at high-water springs, and, even so, such a depth (24 feet) must be regarded as a desirable consummation rather than as an assured possibility. For this reason His Majesty's Government consider that it would serve no use ful purpose, and would indeed formulate an impossible condition, if a more posi tive or unqualified wording than that contained in the British counter-draft were adopted. A paragraph has been added to article 5 in order to avoid a conflict of juris diction which might otherwise arise. There is no change in article 6. A paragraph has been added to article 7 so as to render it more complete. Article 8 has been modified so as to be more in accord with the British counter- draft of the 18th September of the Anglo-German agreement. The final para graph has been added after consultation with Lord Inchcape, the concessionnaire for the Kiver Navigation Company under the Turkish declaracion of the 29th July, 1913. His Lordship is fully prepared to provide, on terms to be mutually agreed, all reasonable facilities to the Baghdad Railway Company; but His Majesty's Govern ment, having regard especially to section 3 of the proposals made on the 7th May, 1913,'would be unable to assent to the grant outside Baghdad of such rights as are contemplated in article 8 of the German counter-draft communicated on the 14th November.

If no such arrangement as suggested by the Russian Ambassador (Constanti nople telegram No. 580 ) can be considered by His Majesty's Government, I mipht endeavour to induce the Russian Government to enter into an arrangement with us by which they would delegate the functions of the Russian consul ad hoc to the British commissioner, who w r ould keep Russian consulate fully informed of matters affecting Russian subjects. 1 could argue that this involves no diminution of treaty rights. {Received on the 21 at December 1913, with Political Secretan/s letter No. 49, dated the 5th December 1913.)

Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive the observations of the Marquess of Crewe on this draft and the enclosures, and, as the German Government have recently been pressing for a reply, he would be glad if his Lordship's observations could be furnished as soon as possible. Lord Inchcape has already been consulted regarding the clauses which especially concern the river na\igation, and they are m substantia] accord with the corre sponding ones in his concession. 1 am, Sm, \ our most obedient, humble servant, EYRE A. CROWE. The Under Secretary of State, India Office. CO NFIDENTIAL. [5064 3] Draft to German Charge d'Affaires. His Majesty s Government have very carefully considered the counter of tt proZe ^lhi &amp;V™t„ C 0™ a \ Cllalg ® d ' Affsiles cn the 4th November, allied questions, and the 'note ^ commenting upon this document. ' e11 lvon ^uhhnann165 Sir E. Grey now lias the honour to transmit a further draft, which is somewhat amended both in form and in substance. The changes of form are primarily due to exigencies of procedure, and are designed to meet the fact that certain stipulations must necessarily, in the first instance, be agreed between the Ottoman Government and the Baghdad Railway Company or the proposed River Navigation Company, as the case may be. The changes of substance are largely attributable to the desire of His Majesty's Government to recall the German Government as nearly as possible to the original proposals which they put forward, as a basis of negotiation, on the 7th May, 1913, and from which each successive counter-draft seems to have constituted a further departure. So wide indeed has been the departure that even such import ant conditions as those contained in section 2 (h) and the first and third sentences of section 3 of the memorandum of that date,—which went far to constitute the credit side of the transaction from the British standpoint,—have now, by the wording of the German counter-draft of the 3rd November, 1913, (article 2, clause (c), last paragraph, article 4, clauses (b) and (c), and article 5, clause (b) ), been substantially whittled away. His Majesty's Government reccgnise that the proposals made on the 7th May, 1913, were to some extent tentative and non-committal, and they have accordingly not been unwilling, as the German Government are aware, to concede certain important points in the course of negotiation in the interests of a general settle ment ; but they are persuaded that they cannot go further in this direction with out so weakening the conditions secured in British interests as to expose the whole Convention to unanswerable criticism and therefore to insuperable objection. This will be the more apparent when attention is drawn to the following consi derations, a course which His Majesty's Government adopt in no controversial spirit. The principal desiderata of His Majesty's Government have from the first been, and, as indicated in the present British counter-draft, still are, confined to two points :— (a) That there should be no change detrimental to British interests in what His Majesty's Government regard as the political status qo at the head of the Persian Gulf. (6) That there should be no sort of discrimination against British trade on the Baghdad Railway. These points are largely covered by section 2 of the memorandum of the 7th May 1913, and by the proposal, confidentially explained to Herr von Kiihlmann on the same date, for the institution of a Riverain Commission on the Shatt-el- Arab. On the other hand, the desiderata of the German Government, as conceded in the present counter-draft, ere relatively not inconsiderable id) His Majesty's Government ag^'ee to an increase in the Turkish customs duties to be borne largely by British trade which represents some 30 per cent, of the total foreign imports into Turkey ; this increase is virtually a sine qua non to the successful completion of the Baghdad Railway. (b) His Majesty's Government undertake not to oppose the construction and management of the proposed railway right down to Basra, the only natural commercial terminus of such a line, by the Baghdad Railway Company. They thereby abandon all claim to British control mthe Baghdad-Basra section : it will be recollected that the satisfaction of this claim was at one time a principal condition of British assent to the customs increase. (c) His Majesty's Government agree that, in the important provinces of Baghdad and Mosul, where British trade has long been predominant, they will support no railway undertakings either in direct competition with the Baghdad Railway Company's lines or with that Company's existing rights. (d) His Majesty's Government agree not to oppose the acquisition by German interests of 40 per cent, of the share capital allotted to Turkey in the proposed Ottoman River Navigation Company. c610fd166 (e) His Majesty's Govemment acquiesce in certain facilities being granted to the Baghdad Railway Company on the River Tigris at Baghdad. While His Majesty's Government have no desire to exaggerate the disparity between these respective desiderata, they are confident that the German govern ment will appreciate their attitude in regarding the proposals put forward in the revised counter-draft now enclosed as representing the utmost limit of concession to which they can properly agree. Sir E. Grey will now proceed to deal seriatim with the points raised by Herr von Kuhlmann in his covering note of the 3rd November, and to refer when necessary to the corresponding clauses of the counter-draft. His Majesty's Government are in principle opposed to explanatory' notes, holding that a convention itself should be so clear and precise as to require no explanation; nevertheless, they recognise that, in the present instance, many points of detail are involved and that their inclusion in the text of the convention might prove somewhat cumbrous and inconvenient, and they are accordingly prepared to defer to the wish of the German Government, on the distinct under standing that the explanatory note is ratified and published at the same time as the convention. His Majesty's Government agree to the adoption of the words tc system and undertaking ' as proposed in article 1, clause (a), provided they are first funished with authentic copies of all existing agreements between the Ottoman Government and the BagKdad Railway Company, including the final text of the supplementarv agreements now under discussion at Berlin, as it is clearly essential that they should know precisely what they are asked to agree to ; provided also that it is expressly agreed in the explanatory note that their freedom of action with regard to future variations of the concession is not impaired by this wording. His Majesty's Government would also agree to the inclusion in the explana- torv note of the words ' under the express condition that no prejudice of an economic or financial nature is caused to Great Britain in pursuance of this cla use. They consider further that the obligations of Great Britain under this clause should be defined in the same document. In the view of His Majesty's Govern ment, Great Britain would be bound, after the signature of this convention and the conclusion of all pending negotiations with Turkey, not to oppose the increase of the Turkish customs duties up to 15 per cent, ad valorem, and not to oppose the allocation of a portion of this increase or of existing Turkish revenues for the purposes specified in article 35 of the Baghdad Railway Convention of March 1903: such an obligation would not, however, commit His Majesty 's Government in advance to support the allocation of any particular revenues, but merely that of adequate revenues, to such purposes. His Majesty's Government prefer the wordsdeclare that they will not oppose ' to those suggested in article 1, clause (6), of the German counter-draft;, this undertaking corresponds, moreover, to that which the German Govern ment assume in article 4, clause {a). The addition suggested by the German Government of the words ' as re presentatives of a group of British shareholders 'in article 1, clause (c), does not commend itself to His Majesty's Government. It is essential that there should be British representatives on the board of the Baghdad Railway/and His Majesty's Government attach importance to an assurance from the German Government that they will use their best endeavours to this end ; but it appears to them otiose to enter in the Convention into the technical formalities which the admission of such representatives may entail. Her von Gwinner explained tc Mr. Parker at the German Embassy on the 7th June, 1913, that their admission could only take place in a manner such as is suggested in Prince Lichnowskv's note of the 16th July, 1913, and, subject to the successful formation of a British group, His Majesty's Government intimated that the arrangements indicated would be satisfactory. While they adhere to this position, they would point out that they have since taken legal advice respecting the bearing of the statutes of the Baghdad Railway Company and of the provisions of Turkish company law on the question, and they are advised that it would not in fact be contrary either to the167 one ot to the other for British representatives with a qualifying holding to be admitted to the board independently of the votes of the shareholders. [Passage to be inserted here by Board of Trade respecting the ' ground-floor terms '* offered bv Herr von Gwinner to Sir H. Babington Smith on the 14th June, 1913.] As regards article 2 certain changes have been made, with a view to greater clearness, in the lettering and numbering of the several clauses and sub-clauses: it will be observed that no alteration of wording is made in clause {a), sub-sections (i) and (w), or in the first paragraph of sub-section (Hi) ; but His Majesty's Govern ment are unable to concur in the proposal that German capital should be repre sented by directors on the board of any railway which might be built from Basra (Zobeir) to the Persian Gulf. Such a proposal, as has already been pointed out, is in direct conflict with section 2 (b) of the memorandum of the 7th May, 1913 ; it also appears to His Majesty's Government misleading and inequitable to stipulate that German representation on such a line should be similar as regards conditions and proportion to any Briti ih participation on the board of the Baghdad Bailway ; the counterpart of any such British participation as may be arranged is rather to be found in German participation in the proposed River Navigation Company. His Majesty's Government attach great importance to all the stipulations which now appear in italics in article 2, clause (a), section (iv) of the British counter- draft being ' adhered to ' by the German Government in the present Anglo- German Convention, even though they may in the first place be the subject of agreement between the Ottoman Government and the Baghdad Railway Com pany. Clauses {h) and (c) of article 2 provide for a British participation, both in the capital and directorate of the company or companies of the ports of Basra and Baghdad, and in the contracts for construction and maintenance, of 40 per cent, of the whole. Such a percentage is, according to Prince Lichnowsky's note of 16th July, what the Baghdad Railway Company are prepared to concede to British interests ; as British participation in the port of Basra up to 50 per cent, is not conceded, as suggested in the British note of the 18th September, 1913, His Majesty's Government now revert to the proposal for British participation in both ports. Clause (d) of article 2 appears very desirable in order to ensure complete equality of treatment. Clauses {a) and (h) of article 3 have not been altered. The German Government express a wish that two changes should be made in clause (c) of article 3, viz,, that the words ' in Ottoman tarritory east of Aleppo ' should be substituted for ' in the provinces of Mosul and Baghdad ', and that the words ' or in contradiction with that Company's existing rights ' should be inserted after the words ' the Baghdad Railway Company's lines.' His Majesty's Government regret that they cannot possibly agree to an ex tension of the geographical area under this clause ; they have had very great hesi tation in agreeing even to the area originally suggested, having regard to the established position of British trade and influence in the provinces specified, but they certainly could not agree to mortgage the future as regards any line which might, at some distant date and under wholly altered conditions, possibly when the Baghdad Railway system is fully developed, be projected from the Mediterranean to Lower Mesopotamia. His Majesty's Government understand that no project for a competing line with the Baghdad Railway from any point on the Mediterranean is at present under contemplation, and that, as regards the Aleppo-Meskene project, nothing beyond a purely negative obligation has been assumed by the Ottoman Govern-168 As regards the second alteration of wording suggested in this clause, His Majesty's Government are prepared to adopt it subject to the insertion of the word ' either ' after ' railway undertakings and provided a satisfactory settlement respecting the oil concessions in Mosul and Baghdad is reached, as they trust may be the case, before the signature of this Convention. His Majesty's Government do not consider that there is any parallel in fact between German participation in the River Navigation Company and British parti cipation in the ports of Baghdad and Basra : if it is desired to establish a parallel it should be sought, due regard being had to the relative magnitude of the two concerns, between German representation in the River Navigation Company and British representation in the Baghdad Railway Company, which, under the convention of 1903, include concessions for the ports of Baghdad and Basra. His Majesty's Government could in no case agree to the wording of article 4, clause (6) of the German counter-draft of the 18th September, any more than they could to that of article 2, clause [d] of the same document : they consider it abso lutely indispensable that British participation in the ports should be fixed in precise terms in the convention itself at 40 per cent, of the whole, and that German participation in the navigation should be expressly limited in the convention itself to a stated maximum; they are further of opinion that the real facts of the agreement would have to be revealed eventually inParhament, and that no obj^it would therefore be gained by their temporary obscuration. If, however, the German Government are anxious to maintain a spectacular parallel, perhaps the wording of article 4, clause (h) of the counter-draft now enclosed might seive the purpose in view. In agreeing not to oppose German participation, to the extent indicated, in the River Navigation Company, His Majesty's Government take formal note of the assurances contained in the German Ambassador's com munication of the 16th July 1913, to the effect that the German Government does not aim at any combination which could endanger effective British control of the navigation, and that the German Government would therefore be prepared to receive favourably any proposals about voting arrangements which would seem to His Majesty's Government desirable in order to assure the effective British control of the River Navigation Company. It will be observed that clause (c) (i) of article 4 has been amended in form, and that the time limit of five years is re-inserted. His Majesty's Government attach cardinal importance to a specific limitation in the duration of the rights of the Baghdad Railway Company under article 9 of the convention of 1903; thev must, in pursuance of section 3 of the memorandum of the 7th May 1913, continue to press for such a limitation, which is not moreover inconsistent with the terms of agreement between the Baghdad Railway Company and either the ' Societe de Transports fluviax ' or Messrs. Lynch Brothers. Sir E. Grey would add that he understands that Messrs. Lynch Brothers are pre pared, so far as they are concerned, to conclude an arrangement such as that con templated under article 4, clause (c) Hi). The changes in article 5 {h) have already been explained in substance in Sir E. Grey's memorandum of the 25th November 1913 ; slight verbal changes have since been made with the object of greater precision. His Majesty's Government, after the most careful consideration, are not able to agree to stipulations such as are contained in articles o-A and 7 of the German counter-draft of the 4th November ; but they would be willing to agree that article 6 of the British counter-draft should be interpreted, so far as possible, in the light of the recommendations of the 9th September 1913, and that these recom mendations should be embodied in the explanatory note ; they understand 'however from Hakki Pasha, that the specific revenues named in section II of those recom mendations have already been earmarked by anticipation for another purpose a subject upon which Djavid Bey may possibly be able to throw more light. V hile resolutely opposed, for the practical reasons explained in Sir E. Grey's memorandum of the 18th September 1913, to the system of dual control which a ' comite de surveillance ' would entail. His Majesty's Government have made a considerable modification in the wording of article 6 in order to meet the criticisms169 of the Grerman Government, and they earnestly trust that the draft in its present form will be acceptable. A copy of the Anglo-Turkish declaration, respecting the rights enjoyed by the nationals of the Treaty Powers in Turkey, is enclosed. In order that the document which formed the enclosure in Sir E. Grey's memorandum of the 25th November 1913, may exactly correspond with the present British counter-draft, a revised version is transmitted herewith. In conclusion, and while expressing the hope that these negotiations may be completed and the Anglo-German Convention signed in the course of next month, His Majesty's Government would again draw the attention of the German Govern ment to the desiderata of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company, which, if dealt with on a sympathetic and broad basis would, they confidently believe, con tribute to the ultimate benefit both of the Smyrna-Aidin and the Anatolian Rail way systems.

I have spoken to my Russian colleague, who telegraphed his views to his Government three days ago. He was reassured on learning that Turkey was a party to declaration of 21st October, which he thought was between us and Russia, as he said that Russian rights could not be made dependent on declaration from us. But he maintained that greater precision was necessary. It must be stated in article 7 that foreign consuls, or dragomans, must be present on occasions when foreigners are brought up, and in article 8 there must be provision for consular sanction in arrests (except perhaps in cases of flagrante delicto) and for detention by consular authorities. I pointed out that declaration amply safeguarded these rights, but he was, rather insistent, saying that these were only his personal views and he was not authorised to discuss them. Perhaps some additional declaration might be suggested which would satisfy- Russian Government if they do not accept it as it stands.

[December 15.] C onfidential . section i . [50543] No. 1. Memorandum communicated to German Charge d'Affaires. His Majesty's Government have very carefully considered the counterdraft, commimicated by the German Charge d'Affaires on the 4th November, of the proposed Anglo-German Convention respecting the Baghdad Railway and allied questions, and his note of the 3rd November commenting upon this document. Sir e. Grey now has the honour to transmit a further draft, which is iome- what amended both in form and in substance. The changes of form are primarily due to exigencies of procedure, and are designed to meet the fact that certain stipulations must necessarily, in the first instance, be agreed upon between the Ottoman Government and the Baghdad Railway Company or the proposed River Navigation Company, as the case may The changes of substance are largely attributable to the desire of His Majesty's Government to recall the German Government as nearly as possible to the original proposals which they put forward, as a basis of negotiation, on the 7th May 1913, and from which each ^ successive counter-draft seems to have constituted a further departure. So wide indeed has been the departure that even such important conditions as those contained m section 2 {h) and the first and third sentences o sec ion o e memorandum of that date,—-which went far to constitute the credit side of the transactom from the British standpoint, -have now, by the wording of the German counter-draft of the 3rd November 1913 [article 2, clause (c), last paragraph, article 4, clauses (6) and (c), and article 5, clause (6)], been sub stantially whittled away. v /J His Majesty's Government recognise that the proposals made on the 7th May, 1913, were to some extent tentative and non -committal, and they have186 accordingly not been unwilling, as fhe German Government are aware, to concede certain important points in the course of negotiation in the interests of a general settlement ; but they are persuaded that they cannot go further in this direction without so weakening the conditions secured in British interests as to expose the whole Convention to unanswerable criticism and therefore to insuperable objec tion. This will be the more apparent when attention is drawn to the following considerations, a course which His Majesty's Government adopt in no contro versial spirit. The principal desiderata of His Majesty's Government have from the first been, and, as indicated in the present British counter-draft, still are, confined to two points :—• {a) That there should be no change detrimental to British interests in what His Majesty's Government regard as the political at the head of the Persian Gulf. (b) That there should be no sort of discrimination against British trade on the Baghdad Railway. These points are largely covered by section 2 of the memorandum of the 7th, May, 1913, and by the proposal, confidentially explained to Herr von Kiihlmann on the same date, for the institution of a Biverain Commission on the Shatt-el- Arab. On the other hand, the desiderata of the German Government, as conceded in the present counter-draft, are relatively not inconsiderable :■ {a) His Majesty 's Government agree to an increase in the Turkish customs duties, an increase which must be borne largely by British trade, seeing that such trade represents some 33 per cent, of the total foreign imports into Turkey , this increase is virtually a sine qua non to the successful completion of the Baghdad Railway. (6) His Majesty's Government undertake not to oppose the construction and management of the proposed railway right down to Basra, the only natural commercial terminus of such a line, by the Baghdad Railway Company. They thereby abandon all claim to British control in the Baghdad-Basra section . it ill be recollected that the satisfaction of this claim was at one time a principal condi tion of British assent to the customs increase. (c) His Majesty's Government agree that, in the important provinces of Baghdad and Mosul, where British trade has long been predominant, they will support no railway undertakings either in direct competition with the Baghdad Railway Company's lines or with that Company s existing rights. (d) His Majesty's Government agree not to oppose the acquisition by German interests of 40 per cent, of the share capital allotted to Turkey in the pro posed Ottoman River Navigation Company. (e) His Majesty's Government acquiesce in certain facilities being granted to the Baghdad Railway Company on the River Tigiris at Baghdad. Wlile His Majesty's Government have no desire to exaggerate the disparity between these respective desiderata, they are confident that the German Govern ment will appreciate their attitude in regarding the proposals put forward in the revised counter-draft now enclosed as representing the utmost limit of concession to which they can properly agree. gjj, Grey will now proceed to deal sefiaZiv/i with the points raised by Herr von Kiihlmann in his covering note of the 3rd November, and to refer when necessary to the corresponding clauses of the counter-draft. His Majesty's Government are in principle opposed to explanatory notes, holding that a convention itself should be so clear and precise as to require no explanation ; nevertheless, they recognise that, in the present instance, many points of detail are involved and that their inclusion in the text of the convention might prove somewhat cumbrous and inconvenient, and they are accordingly prepared to defer to the wish of the German Government, on the distinct under standing that the explanatory note is ratified and published at the same time as the convention.187 His Majesty's Government agree to the adoption of the words ' system ' and undertaking ' as proposed in article 1, clause (a), provided they are first furnished with authentic copies of all agreements between the Ottoman Government and the Baghdad Railway Company, and provided they find no occasion for objection in the final text of the supplementary agreements now under discussion at Berlin, as it is clearly essential that they should know precisely what they are asked to agree to ; provided also that it is expressly agreed in the explanatory note that their freedom of action with regard to future varia tions of the concession is not impaired by this wording. His Majesty's Government would also agree to the inclusion in the explana tory note of the words 44 under the express condition that no prejudice of an economic or financial nature is caused to Great Britain in pursuance of this clause.' They consider further that the obligations of Great Britain under this clause should be defined in the same document. In the view of His Majesty's Govern ment Great Britain would be bound, after the signature of this convention and the conclusion of all pending negotiations with Turkey, not to oppose the increase of the Turkish customs duties up to 15 per cent, ad valorem, and not to oppose the allocation of a portion of this increase or of existing Turkish revenues for the purposes specified in article 35 of the Baghdad Railway Convention of March 1903, such an obligation would -not, however, commit His Majesty's Govern ment in advance to support the allocation of any particular revenues, but merely that of adequate revenues, to such pruposes. His Majesty's Government prefer the words ' declare that they will not oppose ' to those suggested in article 1, clause (£), of the German counter-draft; this undertaking corresponds, moreover, to that which the German Government assume in article 4, clause {a). The addition suggested by the German Government of the words &lt;c as re presentatives of a group of British shareholders ' in article 1, clause (c), does not commend itself to His Majesty's Government. It is essential that there should be British representatives on the board of the Baghdad Railway, and His Majesty's Government attach importance to an assurance from the German Govern ment that they will use their best endeavours to this end ; but it appears to them otiose to enter in the Convention into the technical formalities which the ad mission of such representatives may entail. Herr von Gwinner explained to Mr. Parker at the German Embassy on the 7th June, 1913, that their admission could only take place in a manner such as is suggested in Prince Lichnowsky's note of the 16th July, 1913, and, subject to the successful formation of a British group, His Majesty s Government intimated that the arrangments indicated would be satisfactory. V hile they adhere to this position, they are bound to state that the legal advice which they have obtained respecting the bearing of the statutes of the Baghdad Railway Company and of the provisions of Turkish company law on the question is not quite in accord with the view then expressed by Herr von Gwinner. In this connexion it must be remarked that the terms outlined by Herr von G\\ inner to Sir H. Babington Smith on the 14th June, 1913, are not such as are likely, m the opinion of His Majesty's Government, to encourage British financial participation in the undertaking. The British subscribers are to be required to pa) or their shares in full at par, whereas the original shareholders paid actually onh one-halt of the nominal value of their shares, the remainder being credited to them out of the profits on the construction of the first section of the railway-— a course which seems open to criticism on purely financial grounds. V\ hilst as regards participation in the profits arising from the construction and working o e rai way, British shareholders would thus be in a less favourable position an he original subscribers, they are to be required to put themselves in the same position as original subscribers as regards the very onerous obligations o e syndicate for realising the Government bonds. If substantial British nacua par icipa ion m the enterprise is desired. His Majesty's Government trust that the German Government will use their influence with the Baghdad ai \\ ay ompany o secure an appreciable modification of the terms suggested. creator artlc }® 2 certain changes have been made, with a view to greater clearness, m the lettering and numbering of the several clauses andI mam 'iSSS mi w or{l8 loi fer- 0 rieif' 188 sub-clauses : it will be observed that no alteration of wording is made in clause (a), sub-sections (i) and (ii), or in the first paragraph of sub-section (iii); but His Majesty's Government are unable to concur ip. the proposal that German capital should be represented by directors on the board of any railway which might be built from Basra (Zobeir) to the Persian Gulf. Such a proposal, as has already been pointed out, is in direct conflict with section 2 {b) of the memorandum of the 7th May, 1913 : it also appears to His Majesty's Go\ernment and inequitable to stipulate that German representation on such line should be similar as regards conditions and proportion to any British parti cipation on the board of the Baghdad Railway ; the counterpart of any such British participation as may be arranged is rather to be found in German partici pation in the proposed River Navigation Company. His Majesty's Government attach great importance to all the stipulations which now appear in italics in article 2, clause {a), section (iv) of the British counter-draft being ' adhered to ' by the German Government m the present Anglo -German Convention, even though they may in the first place be the subject of agreement between the Ottoman Government and the Baghdad Railway Com pany. , . . . , I - 1 Clauses (b) and (c) of article 2 provide for a British participation, both m the capital and directorate of the company or companies of the ports of Basra and Baghdad and in the contracts for construction and maintenance, ot 40 per cent, of the whole. Such a percentage is, according to Prmce Lichnowsky s note of 16th July, what the Baghdad Railway Company are prepared to concede to British interests- as British participation in the port of Basra up to 50 per cent, is not coticeded,' as suggested in the British note o£ the 18th September IQtS His Majesty's Government now revert to the proposal for British participation m both ports. Clause {d) of article 2 appears very desirable in order to ensure complete equality of treatment. Clauses {a) and (6) of article 3 have not been altered. The German Government express a wish that two changes should be made in clause (c) of article 3, viz., that the words ' in Ottoman territory east of Aleppo should be substituted for - in the provinces of Mosul and Baghdad and that the words ' or in contradiction with that Company s existing rights; should be inserted after the words ' the Baghdad Railway Company s lines. His Maiestv's Government regret that they cannot possibly agree to an extension of the geographical area under this clause ; they have had very great hesitation in agrelng even to the area originally suggested, having regard to the established position of British trade and influence m the provinces specified, but thev certainly could not agree to mortgage the future as regards any line which might, at some distant date and under wholly altered conditions possibly when the Baghdad Railway system is fully developed, be projected from the Mediterranean to Lower Mesopotamia. ^ Hk Mai estv's Government understand that no project for a competing line with the Baghdad Railway from any point on the Mediterranean is at present under contemplation, and that, as regards the Aleppo-Mesvene project, nothing beyond a purely negative obligation has been assumed by the Ottoman Government. As regards the second alteration of wording suggested in this clause His Majesty's Government are prepared to adopt it subject to the insertion of the word 'either' after 'railway undertakings 'and provided a satisfactory Settlement respecting the oil concessions in Mosul and Baghdad is reached, as they trust may be the case, before the signature of this Convention. His Majesty's Government do not conader that there is any parallel 'n fact between German participation in the River Navigation Company and British participation in the ports of Baghdad and Basra ; if it is desired to establish a parallel it should be sought, due regard being had to the relative magnitude of t P he two concerns, between German representation m he River Navigation Company and British representation in the Baghdad Railway Company which undlr the convention of 1903, includes concessions for the ports of Baghdad and BaSI His Majesty's Government could in no case agree to the wording of article 4 clause (&amp;) of the German counter-draft of the 3rd November any more than they could to that of article 2, clause (d) of the same document: they consider it C658F. D.189 absolutely indispensable that British participation in the ports should be fixed in precise terms in the convention itself at 40 per cent, of the whole, and that German participation in the navigation should be expressly limited in the con vention itself to a stated maximum ; they are further of opinion that the real facts of the agreement would have to be revealed eventually in Parliament and that no object would therefore be gained by their temporary obscuration. If, however, the German Government are anxious to maintain a spectacular parallel, perhaps the wording of article 4, clause {b) oi the counter-draft now enclosed might serve the purpose in view. In agreeing not to oppose German participation, to the extent indicated, in the Eiver Navigation Company, His Majesty v s Government take formal note of the assurances contained in the German Ambassador's communication of the 16th July, 1913, to the effect that the German Government does not aim at any combination which could endanger effective British control of the navigation and that the German Government would therefore be prepared to receive favourably any proposals about voting arrangements which would seem to His Majesty's Government desirable in order to assure the effective British control of the Kiver Navigation Company. It will be observed that clause (c) (i) of article 4 has been amended in form, and that the time limit of five years is re-inserted. His Majesty's Government attach cardinal importance to a specific limitation in the duration of the rights of the Baghdad Railway Company under article 9 of the convention of 1903 ; they must, in pursuance of section 3 of the memorandum of the 7th May, 1913, continue to press for such a limitation, which is not moreover inconsistent with the term of agreement between the Baghdad Railway Company and either the ' Societe de Transports fluviaux ' or Messrs. Lynch Brothers. Sir E. Grey would add that he understands that Messrs. Lynch Brothers are prepared, so far as they are concerned, to conclude an arrangement such as that contemplated under article 4, clause (c) (ii). The changes in article 5 (h) have already been explained in substance in Sir E. Grey's memorandum of the 25th November, 1913 ; slight verbal changes have since been made with the object of greater precision. His Majesty's Government, after the most careful consideration, are not able .to agree to stipulations such as are contained in articles 5-A and 7 of the German counter-draft of the 3rd November; but they would be willing to agree that article 6 of the British counter-draft should be interpreted, so far as possible, in the light of the recommendations of the 9th September, 1913, and that these recommendations should be embodied in the explanatory note : they understand, however, from Hakki Pasha that the specific revenues named in section II of those recommendations have already been earmarked by anticipation for another purpose a subject upon which Djavid Bey may pobsibly be able to throw more light. While resolutely opposed, for the practical reasons explained in Sir E Grey 's memorandum of the 18th September, 1913, to the system of dual control which a comite de surveillance would entail. Hi 1 , Majesty's Government have made a considerable modification in the wording of article 6 in order to meet the criti cisms of the German Government, and they earnestly trust that the draft in its present form will be acceptable.

Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 402 of the 4th instant, I have now the honour to enclose copies of the draft communications to and from the Eussian Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the Shatt-el-Arab Navigation Com mission which I drew up in consultation with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I should explain that when you authorised me to discuss the matter fully with the Eussian Government I proposed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to address them a communication of the nature of the draft Embassy Aide-Memoire, as it seemed clear that this offered the only means of deterring the Eussian Gov ernment from insisting on a change in the text of the Convention of June 11th, 1913, or on the signature of some fresh additional Declaration. There is a certain apparent contradiction between Article VIII of the Conven tion, which stipulates that the Commission's police shall have the exclusive right of effecting arrests, and point (4) of the Embassy Aide-Memoire, which says that the Eussian Consul shall exercise all his usual functions under the Capitulations. But as the Eussian Government would certainly not have formally abandc ned whatever rights of arrest, etc., the Eussian Consul at present possesses under the c658fd i2C2 a.c. conclue entre la Grande Bretagne et la Turquie. Le Ministere Imperial ne manquera pas de charger ses Consuls de veiller a ce que les vaisseaux Russes ne se soustraient pass an pavement des taxes et se soumettent aux reglements qui seront etablis par la Commission pour les batiments de toutes les nations. Les amendes qui seraient imposees a des sujets Russes par le Tribunal de la Commission en vertu de rArticle VII de la Convention ci-dessus mentionnee et de FAide-Memoire du Ministere Imperial du 17 Novembre courant seront remises par les Consul de Eussie a la Commission.

The text of both the declarations drawn up by Mr. O'Beirne in consultation with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Aftairs has the approval of His Majesty's Government but, in view of the last paragraph of the despatch under reference, I propose that their exchange should be deferred pending the definite settlement of the wording of article 6 of the Anglo-German Convention, in connexion with which I would refer Your Excellency to the memorandum communicated on the 15th instant to the German Embassy here. The above information is given to Your Excellency for your personal and confidential guidance. I am, with great truth and respect, Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) E.

British subjects would have the right to the same treatment under the Capitulations. In view of this would not the better procedure le as above ?

The question has been further discussed with Hakki Pasha, who argued that the 2nd article of the proposed declaration to be made by His Majesty's Gov ernment to Russia was an interpretation, in a sense contested by Turkey, of a mat ter in dispute. Russia claimed the privileges in question, and Turkey did not concede them ' in principle '. W hy could not Russia, he asked, be satisfied with a ' general ' declaration, such as the Anglo-Turkish one of October 21st, 1913, to the effect that articles 7 and 8 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 29th, 1913, did not affect the treaty rights of foreign Powers ? His Highness was told in reply, firstly, that Russia would not be satisfied with such a wording, because articles 7 and 8 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention were, in her view, too specific to be neutralised by a declaration in general wording such as that of October 21st, and it was quite clear that Russia would not pay the dues unless she were satisfied by some declaration such as is proposed in the article to which His Highness took exception. Secondly, that His Majesty's Government entirely agreed with the Russian Government in thinking that Turkey would have no right to object to the pro cedure laid down in that article and, such being the case, and there being no other means of securing payment of the dues by Russian ships, there could be no objection to the proposed exchange of notes between the British and Russian Governments. I transmit to Your Excellency herewith a copy of a correspondence with His Majesty's Embassy at St. Petersburgh and of a 'note to Hakki Pasha on the subject. I am, with great truth and respect, Sir, \our Excellency's most obedient, humble Servant, His Excellency The R'ght Honourable Sir L. Mallet, K.C.M.G., C.B., etc., J etc., etc. No. 56299-13. Sir E. Grey presents his compliments to Hakki Pasha and has the honour to ln Highness that His Majesty s Government propose to exchange notes with the^Russian Government on the subject of the rights of police and jurisdic tion to be exercised by the Shatt-el-Arab Navigation Commission. Sir Edward Grey is convinced that the Russian Government would not be satisfied with a general declaration, such as the Anglo-Turkish one of October 21st,iSSimrnm rnrnm 204 1913, to the effect that articles 7 and 8 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 29th, 1913, does not affect the treaty rights of foreign Powers. In the view of the Kussian Government, articles 7 and 8 of the Anglo- Turkish Convention are too specific to be neutralised by a declaration in general wording such as that of October 21st and it is clear to Sir E. Grey that Russia would not pay the dues unless she were satisfied by some declaration such as is proposed in the article to which His Highness took exception. His Majesty's Government moreover entirely agree with the Russian Govern ment in thinking that Turkey would have no right to object to the procedure laid down in that article and, such being the case, and there being no other means of securing payment of the dues by Russian ships, there can be no objection to the proposed exchange of notes between the British and Russian Governments.

Sir, With reference to the Concession granted to me under date of 12th December 1913 by His Highness Hakki Pasha on behalf of the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment, I beg to confirm the assurance, which I have already given to Mr. Alwyn Parkar, C. M. G., viz., that, if so requested by His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment, I will by a separate contract with the Imperial Ottoman Government agree {a) to the Imperial Ottoman Government nominating a representative of the Bagdad Railway interests as one of the Ottoman Directors of the Company which I am to form to work the Concession, {b) to the acquisition by the Bagdad Railway interests of up to but not exceeping 40 per cent, of the share capital of the said Company to be allotted to Ottoman subjects at the first allot ment and the right in respect thereof to subscribe for a rateable proportion of any further issues of capital of the said Company after the first allotment of shares. In giving the above assurance I am of course assuming that the Imperial Ottoman Government will approve any provisions which it may be found neces sary to insert in the Statutes of the Company in connection with the above- mentioned arrangement.

A reply to the letter you speak of goes to you by this mail and I shall be glad if you will remind me as soon as you know definitely that the Anglo-Turkish Convention has been ratified, in case of Government of India ins- tructions being accidentally overlooked here. You would, of course, rightly carry on on the lines you suggest should Shaikh Mubarak die suddenly and I hope you would experience no difficulty. I think a very little recognition by yourself would suffice to keep things quiet. T have no doubt too that instructions will come showering in on us if, or rather when Mubarak dies ana I should certainly come over with instructions as soon as possible. J somehow doubt the necessity of talking the matter over with the Shaikh unless he himself raises it, as he no doubt will from time to time. There has never been any doubt has there of his wishing Shaikh Jabir, his eldest son, to succeed him. That was the position in my time and though I have not yet gene through the files fully. I see passages that have been slipped for me, in Shakespear's time which seem to point to the same conclusion. Yours sincerely, S.G. Knox. ■m[Tfe Docnme .it is the Bntom. M,1. ] TURKEY.

But the purely personal assurance in guarded language which the Crovemraent of India recommend does not, in the Marquess of Crewe's opinion partake suiriciently of the nature of a dynastic pledge to be open to objection d priori and, positively, it seems to him to be very desirable to make such arrangements as will ensure that the successor selected by the Sheikh will be acceptable to His Majesty's Government^ As, therefore, there is nothing in the proposed assurance which in his opinion conflicts with the Anglo-Turkish Convention he trusts that Sir E. Grey will accord it his approval. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HOLDERNESS. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Government of India. (Confidential.) t Bus!lire, November 9, 1913. I HAVE the honour to revert to the question of the Sheikh of Koweit's desire for a dynastic guarantee, last referred to in the Government of India's telegram of the 9th August to His Majesty's Secretary of State. Since our interview in the Shatt-el-Arab on the 7th July, and the despatch of my letter of the 10th idem to Government, Sheikh Mubarak has repeatedly asked the political agent whether there was any reply from Government on this point, and at my recent visit he reverted to the subject of the convention generally and the question of succession in particular. 2. I was glad to find that he had quite reconciled himself to the presence of the Turkish agent and agreed with us that the chances were that he would generally be able to keep the agent in his pocket, as Sheikh Khazal does the Persian karguzar, while if the agent gave trouble he would be able to get rid of him with our assistance. As regards the customs contingency, too, he realised that it was remote at present, and that, relying on our co-operation when the time came, he would not concern himself about it meanwhile. In the matter of the reception of foreigners, e.g., Messrs. Wonckhaus, he readily accepted our view, and would admit none except under our advice. 3. He then turned to the question of the succession, and asked me what Govern ment had said on that point. I replied that they had apparently not found it possible to give me any special reply or instructions. I went on to explain to him that His Majesty's Government naturally had to be very chary of committing themselves to guarantees of this sort for all time and without conditions to safeguard them in certain eventualities, and that in his case, seeing that the Turks had agreed in the present convention to abstain from all interference in the question of succession, it was consequently simply a matter concerning himself and us, and I aid not quite see what reason he had to be anxious about it. Thinking it a pity to lose the opportunity of getting at his real feelings, I continued that Captain Wiakespear and I would, as he knew, shortly be going home on leave, and that we [2001 7/—4]9 three might not have another opportunity of a quiet talk together, so^ could he not, now thaAve were on the subject, confide to us what he really had in mind so that we might understand the position exactly and be in a position to make any further explanation to Government that might be indicated. He readily responded. He said he quite understood the difficulty of His Majesty's Government in such questions and did not want to nominate anybody now as his presumptive successor, nor did he press for anything in writing, but that what exercised him was^ the thought, or the fear, that when the time came for him to go some individual or individuals from among his family or kinsmen, who found themselves disappointed, might engineer active discord which, if we held aloof, might rack the principality and undo his life work as Sheikh in the direction of consolidation and improvement. What he so much wanted was to be able to feel assured that when he joined the majority, provided that we had no reason to differ from his wishes at the time, or his testamentary dispositions if lie went suddenly, we would, in case of necessity, stand by, and even intervene to regulate the situation. We told him that we quite appreciated his point of view and would place it fully before Government for sympathetic consideration. 4. 1 venture to think that it would not be difficult to find a formula that would set the mind of our venerable protege at rest, and I much hope that Government will see their way to devise one which will have that effect without inconveniently committing themselves.

CONFIDENTIAL. March 6. Section 1 [9863 No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Prince Lichnowshi. (Confidential.) bIR E. GRE1 presents ]iis compliments to the German Ambassador, and has the honour to inform his Serene Highness that on the 3rd instant His Majesty's Ambassador at Berlin was instructed to inform the German Government that His Majesty's Govern ment were on the point of concluding their agreements with Turkey so 'far as they are connected with the proposed customs increase as distinct from the monopolies, and that they hoped to reach complete agreement with the German Government in regard to the proposed Anglo-German Convention respecting the Bagdad Railway and cognate matters forthwith. Sir E. Goschen was further to explain that His Majesty's Govern ment were, however, disturbed by the reflection that the British agreements both with Germany and with Turkey could not, to a large extent, become operative until the con clusion of corresponding agreements between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Ottoman Government, and the Ottoman Government and the German Government, and that progress in this direction did not appear to be very rapid. His Excellency was to add that the 31st March was the latest date fixed for the ratification of the British agree ments with Turkey, and, both on this account and in view of the urgent necessity of Turkey for money, which could not be raised until the customs increase had been agreed to, His Majesty's Government earnestly trusted that the negotiations at Berlin might soon be concluded. His Majesty's Ambassador has now been informed by the German Government that the negotiations in question are in suspense, owing to the prolonged absence of Djavid Bey at Paris, and, while the German Government are anxious for their early conclusion, they evidently are far from confident that they will be resumed at an early date, and they are able to give no indication of the date when a conclusion may be anticipated. His Majesty's Government have received this news with much disappointment; they are being pressed to lay the British agreements before Parliament, or to disclose their contents, and a prolonged delay will cause serious inconvenience and even embarrassment. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey would greatly appreciate the action of the German Government if they could expedite the progress of negotiations in which his Majesty's Government are closely concerned, since their conclusion is a necessary preliminary condition of the Anglo-German and the Turco-British agreements being brought to a successful issue. Sir E. Grey therefore trusts that it may still be possible for the Turco-German negotiation to reach a conclusion before the 31st March. Foreign Oifice, March G, 1914.

I have no objection to the modifications in paragraph 1 proposed by Hakki Pasha. I strongly depiecate Hakki I asha s proposals for modifications in text suggested in my telegram No. 293 of 21st May for parapraphs 2, 3, and 5. Their effect would be to depiive all institutions in hired buildings of all privileges until such time as they had become proprietors of premises occupied by them, beause they would not receive firmans until they had done so. We admitted that, in the case of premises which are used for institutional purposes, but which are not held in the corporate name of the societies interested or in the name of trustees, the owners are liable for all real property taxes. In these cases, which are very numerous, institutions are not given finnans, but they are none the less entitled to privileges other than [ ? group omitted: ? exemption from] real property taxes—for instance, exemption from customs duties and recognition as legal entities of foreign nationality. I think that, in the light of this explanation, the reasons for the suggestions made in my telegram No. 293 and the effect of Hakki Pasha's proposals will be obvious. The most serious of the modifications suggested by Hakki Pasha are those in paragraph 5. At the same time I deprecate the suggestion of the alteration of my text of paragraph 2, because the production of plans and title deeds is only necessary when property is owned by the society responsible for the institutions. As regards paragraph 3, my own text is somewhat open to criticism on the ground that it implies that status of institutions in hired buildings is irregular. This implication is much strengthened by the retention of the words I propose to omit. [May 31.] S ection 3 [2136 3][Tfe Document is the Kopert, Maiestt . s TURKEY.

YOUR telegram No. 247 of 2iid June: Anglo-Turkish Convention : Institutions. Hakki Pasha's new text still fails to meet the case of numerous British institutions in hire buildings. Paragraph 3 again implies that their position is irregular. This implication is emphasised by paragraph 2, which makes no provision for communication to the Porte of a list of these institutions, whereas if they are really to enjoy any privileges at all it is essential that Turkish authorities should have an official and up-to-date list of them. Moreover, there is an implicit contradiction between para graph 5 of the new text and second clause of paragraph 1. The latter recognises that institutions in hired buildings are entitled to certain privileges. One of the most important of these in our view is exemption from customs duties, whereas paragraph 5 would appear to confine this to institutions recognised by firman, and consequently to those owning the property occupied by them. It is expressly admitted on our side that the properties rented for institutional purposes are liable to all burdens of other owners of property. We deny that there is any other distinction in the matter of privileges between institutions in hired property and those occupying their own property. There is nothing obscure in this contention, which entirely corresponds with practice hitherto followed. If Hakki Pasha maintains that such other distinction should be drawn, I would suggest asking him to define it before the final text is drawn up. [2165 e—3] M Imof His Britannic a— ^3,(5 1 TURKEY. OONPIDENTIAL [June 6.] Section 1. [25410] No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Sir L. Mallet. (No. 254.) _ (Teleg'raphic.) R. Foreign Office, June 6, 1914. HAKKI PASHA has given me unfavourable replies about (i) the additional clause concerning irrigation works which might affect navigation on Shatt-el-Arab, (ii) short feeder railways, (iii) Arabian lines south of latitude 31, and (iv) he has no satisfactory information about Mesopotamian oil question, though I have impressed upon him my earnest wish to conclude all negotiations by 1st July at the latest. As to (i) the Ottoman Government appear to admit that navigation shall not be interfered with on Shatt-el-Arab by irrigation works, and I have been given no reason to explain their reluctance to embody this admission in an agreement in the wording I have proposed to which I attach importance. The clause I have suggested can do no possible harm to Ottoman interests, as the Commission itself is to be an Ottoman institution. As to (ii) and (iii) I am a little surprised that His Majesty's Government should meet with a refusal in regard to such a moderate request, when Turkey has given such extensive concessions for railways to French and German groups. The. complaint has frequently been made by Turkey that British capital avoids that country as a field of investment; the present attitude of the Turkish Government, in refusing even an option for short feeders to an Ottoman company in which British subjects are interested, is perhaps the true answer to the above complaint. Our wish is to facilitate the economic development of Turkey, and to avoid the total exclusion of British enterprise from the regions where concessions have not yet been given to others. Hakki Pasha says that our requests are regarded at Constantinople as fresh conditions of our assent to the customs increase and monopolies ; this is a mis apprehension. Point (iv) has been a condition from the first. Point (i) we regard as essential to the harmonious and successful working of the Commission, and we have proposed it in the interests of Turkey as much as in those of international commerce. Point (ii) will be very important to the Navigation . Company when irrigation is developed and the local traffic may become some substitute for the diversion of through traffic to the Bagdad Railway. I cannot understand why the Ottoman Government objects to giving the option desired. Point (iii), what we desire is a preferential option for British enterprise, as against foreign, on equal terms.

I aeree to postponement for a few days as you suggest, but it is desirable that before 1st July final agreement should be signed, and not merely favourable obtained. No reply has been received from Hakki Pasha respecting local feeder lines and Arabian lines, and unfavourable reply has been made about suggested new paragrapl to article 5 of monopolies agreement. The monopolies agreement has now been initialled ad refer end,urn, but it cannot be signed until the Mesopotamian oil question is settled, and I should be glad to get the additional paragraph to article 5 agreed to. If this is done, I am quite prepared to agree to discussion of feeder lines and Arabian lines taking place later at Constantinople if you think there is really no jDrospect of Ottoman Government authorising Hakki Pasha to give us some assurances now on these points : they need not form part of the agreement itself, but might be embodied in a separate note. I do not quite understand Grand Vizier's proposal to withdraw Hakki Pasha before he has signed the agreements which he has negotiated. The position, as your Excellency is aware, is that he cannot sign railways agreement until Turkish negotiations with Bagdad Railway Company are completed. You might explain this to his Highness and ask him when this will be. The only other outstanding points are the monopolies agreement, the Smyrna- Aidin agreement, and the pecuniary claims agreement. It is only when these documents are signed that Hakki Pasha could be recalled, unless Turkish Government want to break off negotiations altogether. I understand from Germans that their agreement with Turkey could easily be settled in one day. If so your Excellency might suggest that Hakki Pasha could be given authority to sign all outstanding documents here next week. [2165 ra—3]TURKEY. CONFIDENTIAL. [26303] [June 12., Section 6. No. 1.

German request has been refused by Porte. Egyptian goods at present only pay 8 per cent., whilst goods of foreign origin pay 11 per cent, duty on importation into Turkey. Question therefore now before the lurkisli Government is whether the same ratio should be maintained in favour of Egyptian produce when the duties are raised to 15 per cent., or that Egypt should be treated like other countries and come under 15 per cent regime. Crawford is for Gustoms purposes, in favour of the latter course, but, in view of question of suzerainty and inability ol Egyptian Government to increase Egyptian duties, Porte seems inclined to maintain pieferential tieatment and ratio, so that, when foreign goods are taxed 15 per cent., Egyptian produce may be admitted on basis of 11 per cent. duty.

It is, in any case, a matter which requires most careful and prolonged consideration, and I think it is unreasonable for Ottoman Government to put forward this fresh stipulation now as a condition of signing the monopolies agreement, which has twice been initialled by Hakki Pasha already, and which I am anxious to conclude at once. I should be glad to receive your Excellency's observations by telegram. [2193 6—3] V i ! ! ■ f[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty 's Government.] TUEKEY. CONFIDENTIAL.

(No. 452.) ^ r ' t i?\tnt ^ , Constantinople, June 23, 1914. 1 ENCLOSE a copy of the note which I addressed to the JSubliine Porte on the 21st instant, making the consent of His Majesty's Government for the prolongation of the surtax beyond the 1st July dependent upon the settlement of the various questions now under discussion between the two Governments, including that of the petroleum wells in Mesopotamia. I saw his Highness yesterday, and reinforced the note by an urgent appeal to him to save His Majesty's Government the painful necessity of withholding their consent to this surtax, to which his Highness replied that he was as anxious as you were to terminate these tedious negotiations, and would discuss the whole matter with the Ministers to-day, exerting all his influence in favour of the conclusion of the agreement at once. It was finally arranged that I should call on his Highness at Yenikeuy to-morrow evening to receive my reply. I need not point out the extreme inconvenience which would be caused by definitely withholding our consent to the levy of the 3 per cent, after the 1st July, but in the event of the Turks proving recalcitrant it will be necessary to carry the matter through, in spite of the financial chaos which our action will entail, according to Sir K. Crawford. The Bussian consent, limited to one year, pending the settlement of the question of a Russian representative on the Council of the Debt, was given last week. In this connection I am informed that it is now unlikely that the German Government will insist both on a second delegate and on the alternate presidency, but that they will be satisfied with the latter. The consent of the United States Government is likewise limited to one year, pending the settlement of certain outstanding questions connected with the numerous American missions and scholastic establishments in this country. I reported in my despatch No. 72, Commercial, of the 13th May last, the arrange ment under which Germany agreed to the continuation of the surtax also tor one year. The other Powers having given their consent, that of His Majesty's Government is now alone in doubt. I also enclose copy of a note reminding the Porte of the necessity of obtaining the consent of the minor Powers to the continuation of the surtax as instructed in your telegram No. 257 of the 10th instant. I have, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Sir L. Mallet to Halim Pasha. Altesse, Constantinople, le 21 juin, 1914. D'ORDUE de mon Gouvernement, j'ai 1'honneur d'attirer votre attention tres serieuse sur les considerations suivantes relatives aux negociations qui se poursuivent actuellement a Londres : 1. Son Altesse Hakki Pacha vient de communiquer a Sir E. Grey un projet modifie de la Convention sur le Reglement des Reclamations pecuniaires britanniques. L'adoption de ce projet comporterait un changement si radical du texte, tel qu'il a deja ete parafe il v a quelque temps, que le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste britannique n'a pu qu'^tre vivement surpris de la communication, d'autant plus que son Altesse Hakki Pacha a eu depuis des mois pleine connaissance de la maniere de voir de Sir E. Grey a ce sujet, ce qui lui aurait permis de proposer anterieurement toute modification qui ptit sembler necessaire a son Gouvernement. 2.

Some of the correspondence comes as enclosures.The documents relate to the latter stages of negotiations and partly consist of drafts and counter-drafts of the eventual agreement, which was never ratified because of the outbreak of the First World War. They also reflect Britain's involvement in the agreement between the Ottoman Turks and the Baghdad Railway Company. Also covered is a discussion about what to do in case of Sheikh Mubarak of Kuwait's sudden death and territorial claims made by Ibn Sa‘ud on what may be Kuwaiti land.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>National Bank of Turkey</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Arabistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Basra</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Adana</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00024c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
