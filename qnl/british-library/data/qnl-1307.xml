Request confirmation if you agree to dismantle special service R.A.F. Wireless station at Kuwait and its return to Shaihah. There appears to he no traffic to warrant its retention and wireless telegraphy operators and equipment are urgently required for other commitments undertaken.Political afcc. C/7 Kir^ait, 3rd January, 1942. From Major T. Hickiribotham, 0.B.1!., Political igent, Kuwait. To The Chief Signals Officer, Boyal Mr Force, ^ Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram 3/683 of December 31st, 1941. 2. I am replying by letter as the recyphering tables for the Interdepartmental Cypher have been compromised aM I have received strict instructions that until neu ones are received the Cypher must not be used. 3. As far as I am concerned politically I agree to the dismantling of the special Service R.A.F wireless station as I can now get in touch with Bahrain and Shaibah, should the necessity arise through the 3T/T station of Messrs. Cable and tireless. 4. I presume you will come to some arrangement with Messrs. Cable and Tireless to take B.A.F messages to me dealing with the arrival and departure of aircraft. You are probably aware that twenty four hours notice of the intending arrival of service machines here is required so that I can inform His Highness the Bhaikh 5 and what may be of more importance to you is the fact that unless I am informed that an aircraft has taken off for Kuwait or on departure from here has arrived safely I cannot take immediate steps to institute a search for over due planes that may have force landed. This you must understand is a very serious matter/2 matter in the summer *nd delay in sending out search parties Until the land line is repaired the only prompt method of communication \srith the various Military Authorities in Basra is through your special service station since telegrams sent through Messrs• Cable and Tireless take from t^o to six days 'between here and Basra. I suggest that the Military Authorities 'be informed of your intention. may result in loss of life The last aspect of the question is the Military one I have the honour to 'be Sir Your most obedient servant Major Political Agent, Kuwait.Telegram - S ^rom - Political Agent, Kuwait.

A 4 R.A.P have asked whether I agree to their wireless station here Being removed as equipment and operators are urgently required elsewhere. I have replied that I have no political objection as Cable and tireless are now operating and I presume R.A.P will come to some arrangement with them for R.A.P. messages. 2. I have also suggested to Manager of Cable and Tireless that he should endeavour to arrange to transmit telegrams direct to Basra and not as at present via Bahrain which takes up to eight days. 3.

It is extremely unfortunate that both the cables should go at this time. If it is not possible to do local repairs we shall have to wait for our boat to come up, and that might take a considerable time. I have no idea where she is at the moment. I am enquiring about this. you at once. As soon as I hear from Karachi I will advise I hope your extension telephone is working satisfactorily. Major T. Hickinbotham, The Political Agent.

Telegrams from Basra to Kuwait via Gahle and hireless normally take at least 14 hours and when interruptions occur several days. The land line via 3afwan has not yet been completed as essential stores are still awaited from India. 3. Thile I can see no political objection to removal of R.A.F. 7/T station I consider that serious consideration should be given to the need for immediate communication with Kuwait in the event of aircraft being overdue or for some important military purpose. The Manager of Cable and 7ireless informs me that he has not repeat not been approached by the R.A.K. to receive messages on their behalf. - POLITICAL -(5/G92) Wt. 17589/898. 400M pads. 8/40.

There is a general shortage of wireless operators throughout the Middle East and severe demands for them are being made on this Group. These demands make it imperative that the fullest possible use is made of every operator for our operational commitments and, as an alternative means of communication to you already exists through 'Gable and Y/ireless', I very much regret that Air Headquarters are insistent that the post at Kuweit must be withdrawn. Your co-operation in administering the operators while they have been stationed with you, frequent ly under difficult and at times irritating circumstances, has been greatly appreciated by myself and Air Headquarters as well.

It was received in this Agency on the 17th evening and, according to the usual procedure after decyphering was handed to the R.A.F. wireless station at the Agency on the 18th May. There it remained until the I.T.T. Shuwaikh who are 5 miles from Kuwait collected it hy lorry presumably on the 19th May. The difficulty is that the only method of communication between Kuwait and the I.W.T. Shuwaikh is the latter # s lorry which calls at the R.A.F. W/T station Kuwait for signals and correspondence only every evening. The only remedy I can see is (if it is thought worth while) to lay a land telephone line connecting this Agency or the R.A.F.
