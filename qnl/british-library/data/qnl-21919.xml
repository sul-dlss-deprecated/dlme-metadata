Air Headquartersj British Forces in 'Iraq, Hinaidi. SSCRE f 27th Fe or^ary 1^35 My dear Fovvle, Since our recent conversation at Bushire I have been examining, in ratuer closer detai ., the me ins oi carrying out air operations in the Sfersian GuLi sulu ^^ such become necessary• as you know, tn suqadrons o this Coj^manu, butn i.ana jlanes aiia seaplanes, are unaertaking regular flights down tne Guli', and although facilities for purely flying purposes, i.e», aerodromes, landing g.'ouna , ali.^htii^g areas, ana rest houses exi; t at coixVenienL intervals down the Guli, it is only at either end, ''iha is at Babrah ana at Muscat, that stores of bombs are maintained• This means that, should operations ave to be carried out with either Banrain or Sharjah ac a 'aso, the necessary stocks of bombs ana ammunition woula have to bo made up, possibly at sliox't notice, oeforo^ ana. 2. This position, I think you will a£Tee with me, is both uneconomical ana illogical and mi^ht, an extrei ^ ca € . load to a delay in com ■ncj.:^ air operat 'vhioh, as we know from experience in the ^ast, mi^ht occasion an undue prolongation of them. 3. The solution to the ^robZe Ties in the esta^-ish- ment of stocks of bombs ara ami..unition at Bahrain ana Shar-jah. With stocks at these two places, together -.ion thos- already ertablinhed at Basrah and TAidcat, the v;hol r O j.' the Arabian cueist oi the ^uli' together with a lor ^'e area in the interior could be readied by aircraft based upon one of tne our places named. 'T is assumes ' lie effective range of the aircrait as 200 miles. 4. I do not feel that in making this suggestion to establish bomb stores at Bahr dn an- Sharjaii I am makm^ a proposal which is opposed to present policy because aircraft without their required stuc :s oi bor:.bs aiia ammunition readily at hana are virtually powerless. It is nut possible, /or instence, to i ualise t^^e sloo^ s of the Persian Gulf Division of tne Royal ^avy carr^^n^ out their x atrols in the Guli' without ammunition on board. 5. While considering this subject, I loo.ced into the circumstances in which the present bomb store at I.uscat was constructed, and ascertained that the stoc'- Ox bombs and amLiunition was originally located there in connection with the Sur opei'ations in ^931. The bombs v/ere never actually used, neither v/ere they removed after the operations were concluded. The convenience o^ maintaining the stock at !!uscat was clearly reco^iised ana the construction of an e *ficient aixd properly located store was a natural corollary. The only political question as far as I have been able to ascertain was the obtaining of the Sultan's permission regarding the site ana the arrangements for protecting the store. Liout. -Colons T .C • I 1 0hJuluj ,o • .j_i ., The Kon'ble Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Hesiaency, Bushire. 6./3 6. I suggest that at Bahrain and Sharjah we should have no serious political difficulty in establishing bomb stores. At Sharjah, the store can be constructed at some suitable point within the wire fence j and at Bahrain 1 propose 'that it should be located within the area of the Royal Air Force Rest House* I have not gone into the sites in detail y e ^j on first examination I think these would be the most suitable and least contentious* ?• The question of agreement in principle must be settled before work can be commended • From the point of view of my own Commani, it is not necessary for me to approach the ^ir Ministry for sanction as I can undertake the construction out of funds under my immediate control. From your side, I presume that no political objections would arise should the stores be located at the places which I suggest as they would be on sites at present leased or actually purchased by the Air Ministry. 8. I therefore wish to let you know what I have in mind, and subject to you^ agreement would like to go ahead on the lines which I have indicated. I feel that the situation at the moment is both unsound and illogical, and I am anxious to put matters right with the least possible delay. Unless, therefore, you see anv serious objection to my proposal, I propose to have the work put in hand at an early date. Yours sincerely, sd.W.G.S.Mitchell.Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Campi BAHRAIN• Dated the 2nd April, 1935. Please refer to your demi-official letter No.S.11621/0.0., dated the 27th February 1936. 2, I see no otjection to (in fact I quite agree with) your suggestion of establishing bomb stores at Bahrain and Sharjah, where, as you point out, we either own or lease the ground where it is proposed to put these stores. In principle there would appear to be no difference between having stores of rifles and ammunition and of bombs. 3, I am giving a copy of your letter and oi my reply to the Political Agent, Bahrain, with whom please correspond direct regarding details, letting me hav/y copies.

In the course of conversation I asked the ^haikh v.hy he had telegraphed from Riyadh to stop the work and he said that it was because he had received a letter from his brother, Shaikh Muhammad, which showed that the store was being built outside the barbed wire enclosure. Attached to the letter was a rough sketch which he showed me, in which the store is marked as outside the barbed wire. T said that the store appeared to be within the area of the landing ground to which he replied that the place where aeroplanes land was very large.

Sharj ah, 20th Jainuary 194CL Will you please refer to my demi-official letter L T o»646- 6/3 of 28th November 1940, regarding the Sherjah Bomb Store ? 2. An Air Force Inspector is corning here next month, leaving 1 Iraq on February 4th by steamer, but I understand unofficially that his visit has no connection with my complaint® 3» Although we may perhaps assume that the likelihood of further air raids does not now exist, the store, in its present condition ana situation, still constitutes a distinct danger to value hie Government property, including essential wireless apparatus. It is also reported that crystallization of the bombs themselves is getting in, and although the whole matter is very techrncal, I believe this to mean that there is a possibility of the bombs exploding on their accord. 4. I would therefore be grateful if you would please bring this aspect of the matter to the notice of die competent authorit ies. At the least, I feel that an expert should come here at I a very early date to examine the position.n &amp; THE CPPICE OP THE AlH LAISON OFFICER, BAHRAIN. Reference. 26th. January, 1 0 41.

Mention is made of the requirement for a bomb store at the RAF base at Bahrain at the beginning of the file, but it does not constitute a significant part of the file. The principal correspondents in the file are the Residency Agent or Trucial Coast Political Officer at Sharjah (notably Khan Sahib Husain ibn Hasan ‘Amad, as officiating Residency Agent from September 1935 to May 1936, and Captain Roy Douglas Metcalfe, as Political Officer between October 1940 and March 1941), the Political Agent in Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch until April 1937, Captain Tom Hickinbotham from April 1937 until October 1937, Hugh Weightman from October 1937 to October 1940, Reginald George Evelin Alban thereafter), and the ruler of Sharjah, Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr.The contents of the file cover the following topics: instructions from Air Vice Marshall WGS Mitchell of Air Headquarters in Iraq in February 1935 for the establishment of bomb stores at the RAF bases at Bahrain and Sharjah, to fill gaps in the air route between Basra and Muscat; negotiations with Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah over the construction of a bomb store at the RAF aerodrome at Sharjah; dispute between Shaikh Sultan and British officials over the location of the bomb store, leading to British officials withholding part of the Shaikh’s monthly allowance until the dispute was settled; Shaikh Sultan’s demand for rent on the new bomb store, and the rejection of this by the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle), on the basis that the bomb store was being constructed for the purpose of British protection of Sharjah; annual inspection of the Sharjah bomb store by Air Ministry inspectors; concerns in late 1940 over the Sharjah bomb store, including its location, overstocking, bombs not being stored underground, and bombs being stored alongside detonators; construction of a new bomb store at Sharjah in early 1941, underground and at a new location on the RAF base.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Sharjah, British air base</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000090#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
