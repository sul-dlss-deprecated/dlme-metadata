Begins : This person is a Pakistani member of the Ahmedia organisation and appears to have visited the Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan for the express purpose of proselytising for his sect of Islam. He spent some time in Amman and distributed literature in Arabic fairly widely but, in spite of the fact that the sect is regarded by the Sunni Moslems as being heretical, he failed to attract much attention in the capital. He next transferred his activities to Kerak and there came into collision with the simpler and more narrow minded country folk. So much feeling was generated on the subject that it was considered that, in the interest of his own safety, he had best leave the country immediately and an order was issued for his deportation. He left Jordan territory for Syria. Rashid Ahmed does not appear to have indulged in any political activities during his stay in Jordan. Ends . 2.
