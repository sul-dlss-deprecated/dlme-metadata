Hennell encloses the following two documents, which he trusts may remove any remaining doubts of Mirza Mahmood's honesty:Translated substance of an istishhad nama, not dated, provided by the Shiraz Agent [Mirza Mahmood], in which a series of individuals testify that the Agent bought a gold watch from Hajee Mahomed Jaffer;Translated substance of a letter, dated 15 July 1850, from Hajee Mahomed Jaffer to Samuel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, in which Hajee Mahomed Jaffer confirms that he sold to the Agent a watch which he himself had bought from a man named Moollah Mehdy.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000033#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
