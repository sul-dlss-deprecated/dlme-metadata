D.O. C £=z/lv} A/0! i. September 16th 1963. The following are the facts about the slaughter house in Manama as far as I have been able to discover. 2 . Shaikh Sulrnan holds a ' hiba ' paper from Shaikh lea gifting to him the meat market of Manama ' and purtenances M , the word in Arabic is ' tawabia ' which means things belonging to. Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa holds a similar paper for the meat market of Muharraq. 3. The slaughter house in Manama used to be on wi-at was ti.en the sea shore but is now part of the ci-arcoal market behind the new vegetable market north east of the Municipal building. This ground was and still is the property of Shaikh hamed. 4. In Daly’s time, soon after the Municipality was startea in Manama, and on his suggestion, the municipality laid down regulations' for slaughtering of animals and clean methods of dealing with hue meat. Certain fees were imposed by the Council on every head of sheep or of bullocks which were slaughtered, ti.ese fees were collected by the Municipality and formed part of their revenue. After a short time it was found that the site of the slaughter house, in the middle of the bazaar, was unsuitable and so it was removed to another site immediately opposite the Municipal offices on what was then the sea shore. Tnere are still some remains of this slaughter house in existence. This also was part of Siaikh Hamed’s property. It was necessary to reclaim the ground from tne sea in order to build the slaughter house and the cost of tais ana the building cost about Rs 1000/-. Shaikh Hamed was the President of the Municipality in those days and Shaikh Sulman was a member. Shaikh hamed paid Rs 500/- from his private purpose to the Municip -ality as an assistance towards filling in the ground. Periiaps t^-is also was a suggestion of Daly’s. All this time no complaint was made by Shaikh Sulman. 5. Later on, about seven years ago, the western sea road was made so the slaughter house instead of oeing on the sea shore became _ inside the sea road. 1 1 * was moved again to a site on the south side of the fort on the sea shore right beyond the rifle range ana tnere it remaineu until about two years ago. 6. About two years ago, v/ith the permission of the Government, a new and more elaborate slaughter house was builjf on the staple south of the V/ireless, it consists of a long pier out into the sea with a building at the end with cement floors and all suitaole arrangements for sluicing out the floor etc etc. It was opened with some ceremony by the Shaikh and nas been “sed eve* oince and is in every way suitable. The animals are taken up there fcvery evening and killed in the morning in the presence of tne Municipa Inspector, the meat is then taken to the market in tne Municipal lorry which even in these times has to make several trips oo tue market. There is a permanent man in charge of the place who is responsible for keeping it clean and altogether it is very well run nd tie revenue amounts to between Rs 4000 and Rs 300u per annum. The slaughterhouse cost about Rs 4000 to build. About eighteen months ap*o during a dispute with the butchers Shaikh sulman be&amp;an to oomplaL about not getting any of the fees from the slaughter house. fa7. The position in Muharraq is rather different. i he slaughter house is and always was on Shaikh Mohammed’s private property and he claimed the fees collected from it. He too held a niba document from Shaikh Isa. The Municipality of Muharraq was not contented with the previous building which was dirty and unsuitable so they arranged with Shaikh Mohammed that trey should ouild a new place at his expense and recover the cost from him. A his was aone but when the cost of the building had been paid tre fees irorn slaughter house reverted to Shaikh Mohammed. 8. Shaikh Sulman does more work than any of the other Jiiialilah Shaikhs and he is, presumably, the heir apparent, his salary from the Civil List is not excessive and is far less tinn .uis uncles Shaikhs Mohammed and Abdulla and lately he has irequently told me that he5 expenses are continually increasing because people come t-o regard him more and more as the heir apparent and such a position carries with it certain obligations. Sliaikhs Mohammed and Aodulu.a when talking over the me,tter both agreed that it was not unreasonable, of him to try to increase his income, but it is unsuitable that he should increase it from the pocket of the Municipality which would be the affect if he is allowed to pocket the slaughter fees* Snaikh Mohammed is supporting him in his claim because he is doubtless nervous at the possibility of his own revenue in muharraq being questioned and I think Siiaikh Abdulla is supporting him for otner personal reasons, because he wants Shaikh Sulman to use his influence, with Shaikh named in connection with a gift of property to Siiaikh Abdulla’s son in law. In these matters ti-cre is usually a quid pro quo. The municipality must naturally accept any suggestion of the Ruler and so they cannot complain and if any member openly opposed the matter he v/ould incur the displeasure of Siiaikh. Sulman ana Shaikh Mohammed xiix which would be inadvisable. The Manama Municipality is a very successful institution and one of the most successful departments of the Government, but their income lias diminished considerably ana ti^ey cannot afford to lose three or four thousand rup££s of their income. They work on a Budget and the slaughter house revenue is included in it. If they are to be debarred from recieving any revenue from it it v/ould be better that this tax should be entirely abolished as the general public would then benefit from the ci^ange. 9. About two years ago, while I was on leave, the tax was slightly increased, on Prior's suggestion, in order to obtain funds for a worn ual . doctor or nurse. The nurse lias lately been obtained ana. lias started her v/ork and this extra, fee which was collected by the Government is to be spent by the Municipality on paying for the nurse ana the womens dispensary which was lately opened.{+ Translation of letter ^0.518/2 dated the 28th Jamad Awv/al 1352(18th September 1933)from the President,Manamah Baladeya, addressed to Captain E.H.Gastre11,Political Agent,Bahrain. s.f* 0 '* After Compliments.

My opinion is that the income of the slaughter house should be included with that of the meat market as it is done in I.luharraq which is being the right of the son Shaikh Salman. The two documents issued by my late father to my brother Shaikh Muhammad and my son Shaikh Salman are documents of gift dealing on t one subject. ysw I firmly hope that^will make arrangements in having the slaughter house included in the meat market.■—•' S.N0:1.
