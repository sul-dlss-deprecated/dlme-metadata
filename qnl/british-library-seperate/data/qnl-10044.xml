The correspondence consists mainly of exchanges between the British Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, the British Political Agent in Kuwait, and the Colonial Office in Whitehall, London. Many of the papers discuss the controversy surrounding the entry of the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited into competition with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for oil contracts in the Persian Gulf. Arabic documents are primarily letters from the Ruler of Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Contract law</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, oil company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Petroleum</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000f3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000f3#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000f3#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000f3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
