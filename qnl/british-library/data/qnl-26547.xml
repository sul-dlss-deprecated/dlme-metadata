Ibn Saud has replied to my message saying that he is grieved to learn that His Majesty’s Government consider their interests to be endangered by the situation in Yemen and that he would be much upset if they were caused embarrassment by any action of Imam, in dealing with whom it is necessary to' remember three things: (1) An intriguer. (2J His judgement is unsound. (5) He has not complete control of affairs in 'his country. 2 f Ibn Saud goes on to suggest he should send a confidential envoy to Imam bearing letter based on King’s knowledge of Imam’s peculiar character and prejudices containing soundest and most pointed advice the King considers it possible to give. This might have the required effect and if not the King would at least 'have done his duty'. Do His Majesty’s Government think this a good suggestion ? • 3* Tbn Baud’s own attitude is that he earnestly desires Imam’s good but at the same time wishes to shape his policy in conformity with that of His Majesty’s Government and will approve whatever view of situation they take* [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrongs]MpflMWMMPtnnBR k»4 ^ 7 cW- jY40£* e j 4 ** [Cypher] DEPARTx.SNTAL NO. 1 . 1 FOREIGN OFFICE. i\ L No# 587 ■ .: 8th April,.1342# D#'.- 7#50 p.m. 8th April, 1942.

I have now considered the report by Domville on his return after investigation locally and discussed with the Governor of Aden/ Air Officer Commanding and others concerned. 2. Names have been obtained of 41 Axis nationals in the Yemen of whom 31 Italian and remainder German. •They constitute the last pocket of Axis influence, with the’exception of Jibuti, in the Red Sea area. The potential dangers are*: (a) In the event of the Imam’s death they might foster disorders on the Aden frontier and support the succession of the anti-British heir-apparent. Unrest is however to be expected in any eYent v/hen the Imam dies. (b) Passage of information to the enemy, overland from Aden and thence by Italian controlled wireless Sanaa-Jibuti-Rome. (Note however that now the blockade has been lifted, dhows can pass direct from Aden to Jibuti and Red Sea shipping can inany case be watched from the French side of Perim Straits. First requisite is tightening of security arrangements to prevent information from getting out of Aden, which I understand is now being put m hand). 3. As a result of the Aden discussions it was recommended that the removal of Axis nationals from Yemen, if considered desirable, might be attempted in the following stages:- (i) Ibn Saud and Iraqi Government approach the Imam to point out the disastrous effetpt of Axis intrigues in Iraq and Persia and mention that ii the Allies were forced to take steps to remove the Axis influence from Yemen he could expect no sympathy or help from other Arab countries. «...(ii) I ibarrH^v a !

Not considered that the result could be achieved by purely subversive ac ti on. * 4. I brought the whole question before the M.E.W.C. at the last meeting. The Council agreed that in principle it was very desirable to eliminate the Axis elements from the Yemen, but decided that it was undesirable, and indeed in the present circumstances, out of the question, for us to resort to forceto achieve - it^Tf we are to use persuasion, Ibn Saud s advice as to the best method of approaching the problem of eliminating the Axis elements from the Yemen, would be of great value, especially since he has recently himself expelled Italians and we consider full use should be made of him to bring pressure on the Yemen. Council concluded, however, that it would be a mistake to discuss the subject at all with the Iraqi Government, 5. Do you agree to Ibn Saud being asked 'through His Majesty’s Minister [? grp. omtd. ? for] his advice on the best way of eliminating Axis elements in the Yemen? It would have to be made clear to him that we ourselves had no intention of using threats or resorting to force. [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong.

( 3gd;) B.t/.3eager, AS. Political Secretary.Copy (E 5275/10/91) An^lo-Yemeni Relations Prince Hussein of the Yemen, who is still in this country, asked me to call on him today to discuss H an important matter'. 2. After nearly an hour of preliminaries and general talk about Anglo-Yemeni relations, in the course of which His Royal Highness asked whether it was not always better that really friendly relations should be on a basis of complete frankness, the Prince said that he had a matter which he wished to raise with me purely personally and informally, in order that there might be no cloud on the friendly relations so happily established between this country and the Yemen. According to the Treaty of Sana’a of 1934, the precise frontier between the Aden Protectorate and the Yemen had, he said, been left over for subsequent negotiation, and meanwhile the status qu o would be maintained in the Protectorate. Yet in spite of this a declaration had recently been made by His Majesty’s Government which seemed not altogether to accord with this engagement. 3. I said that I was not sure that his statement as to the provisions of the Treaty was absolutely accurate. But, clearly, it would be necessary, before the subject could be further discussed, to have the precise text before us. Meanwhile, as I had explained when I first made the appointment, and at the beginning of our interview, I was somewhat hurried, as I was leaving for Geneva the next day and still had a numbernumber of matters to see to. The subject which H.R.H. had raised was clearly one of importance, which would need to be discussed calmly and at leisure, with the text before us, and not somewhat hurriedly with, so to speak, one eye on the clock. I therefore suggested that it might be preferable to postpone our discussion of this matter until my return from Geneva, which would probably be in a week or 10 days time. I would then make another appointment with H.R.H. and bring the relevant text with me. The Prince, who was already aware that I was necessarily somewhat in a hurry and who, I think, realised that the interview had already taken over an hour, agreed, and made no difficulty about postponing the discussion. It will, however, I fear, be necessary to re-open the subject on my return. 4. My impression is that this is another echo of Mr. Philby’s campaign about our efforts to bring the north-eastern areas of the Protectorate, and particularly the Wadi Hadramaut under some sort of administrative control. It might be well, before the next interview, to consult the Colonial Office as to the best line to take when the conversation is renewed. 5. It is just possible - though I think unlikely - that the Italians have put the Prince up to this. But I think it is more probable that both the Italians and the Yemenis have had the idea put into their heads by Mr. Phiilby’s articles. (Signed) G.W. Rendel* 8th SeptemberA1 3 ./ Copy. (E 5892/10/91) k J 7 AITGLO -YiJI.'liilTI RLiX ATlUi.'S . ~7 rs c* /UDO j At the end of my last interview with Prince Hussein on September 8th (sec 2 5275), it was agreed that I should let him know as soon as I got hack from Geneva in order that he might develop his views to me on the question of Anglo-Yemeni relations, with particular reference to the situation on the frontier of the Aden Protectorate in the light of our alleged 'forward policy'. I accordingly arranged to see the Prince this afternoon. The interview lasted over two hours. ^• Alter the usual preliminaries, the Prince explained that what he wanted to discuss was the situation in what he called 'the nine districts'. Realising that he was making the same confusion as his father between the list of tribes under British protection and Article 3 of the Treaty of Sana’a (see paragraph 2 of Aden despatch Ho.2 of September 1st to the Colonial Office in E 5811/4386/91), I asked him to what part of the Treaty he was referring, since as far as I could see the whole question of the frontier was adequately dealt with in Article 3. After some hesitation the Prince replied that it was indeed to this Article that he was referring, but he seemed somewhat embarrassed on finding no reference in the Treaty to the nine districts, and spent a good deal of time during the interpretation of his remarks in looking through the Arabic text of the Treaty, which I had brought with me and of which I had handed him a copy.V 3. The Prince then tried to arcue that Article 3 of the Treaty provided for a complete maintenance of the status quo in all the districts in the neighbourhood of the frontier. He said that whatever the text of the Treaty might say, the point of view of each party had been clearly understood by the other in the course of the negotiations. His Majesty^ Government were therefore well avare that the King of the Yemen had never abandoned his claims to the districts in question, and it was for this reason that it had been understood that the statu s quo should be maintained. ' ^ replied uhat the main object of the Treaty had been to define the boundary between the British and Yemeni administrations. For many years Anglo-Yemeni relations had been unsatisfactory owing to the disagreement which existed about the frontier. It was mainly because the Treaty of 1934 had put an end to this controversy by establishing an agreed frontier for at any rate the next forty y^ars that Anglo-Yemeni relations had so greatly improved. I could see nothing in the Treaty referring to the maintenance of the status quo within any territories on either side of the frontier. The status o^uo referred to the frontier line itself. The object of Article 3 was to define the limits of British and Yemeni control, and it was for this reason that it was specifically laid down in that Article that there should be no violation of the frontier or interference across it. Ve had no intention whatever of extending our control beyond it, but clearly we were free to do what we thought right on our own side of the line. 5. The Prince insisted that the Article meant a great deal more than this, and laid stress on the very wide wording of the Article, and the use of the phrase 'the situation existing in regard to the frontier'. He said that, in view of the history of the long and difficult negotiations which had led to the conclusion/conclusion of the Treaty, it was clear that the Article was meant to cover the maintenance of the internal status quo in the nine districts, and that the fact that the frontier was provisional and that new negotiations were provided for showed that this was the intention, 6. I drew his attention to the fact tnat there were still thirty-seven years in which to negotiate, and that in these circumstances the provisional character of the frontier could not he regarded as affecting the internal arrangements on each side of it. The Prince, hov/ever, continued to insist on his contention that the King of the Yemen had never abandoned his rights over certain districts on our side of the frontier, and that, until a final settlement was reached as provided for in the first sentence of Article 3 of the Treaty, no action ought to be taken in those districts to prejudice the position. 7. He then made a long appeal to me to the effect that His Majesty’s Government, in view of their known desire to establish terms of close and cordial friendship with the Yemen and what he described as their known sympathy towards the ideal of an independent and united Arabia, should recognise the Yemeni claims to districts v/hich were essentially Yemeni by race and religion as well as on historical grounds, and negotiate a new frontier settlement under Article 3 of the Treaty of Sana’a, providing for the ’’return” of these districts to/to the Yemen. He urged that His Majesty f s Government would lose nothing by doing this, since these districts were of no real value to them. 8.. I pointed out to the Prince that he was in fact reopening the question which had been settled by the Treaty of Sana’a. For him to revive and press these Yemeni claims would simply bring us back to the situation existing before the conclusion of the Treaty. He must know that this question of the frontier of our sphere of influence in Southern Arabia was a very ancient one. It had led to difficulties with the Turks, which had been settled by various conventions between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government. I did not wish to appeal to those Treaties at this moment, as I did not wish to revive the old discussion about their validity. But I quoted them as showing that His Majesty’s Government had always adopted a consistent policy on this point, and that they really could not consider altering the frontier line.' 9. As regards what he had said about the districts being of no use to us, I wanted to point out that our relationship with these tribes rested, as in the case of our relationship with other Arab rulers in other parts of Arabia, on a set of treaties v/hich involved mutual obligations. The chiefs concerned made certain promises to us in these treaties, in return for which we undertook to protect them from outside interference. We could not disregard these obligations. 10. The Prince, in a long and rather rambling statement, explained that the question of these treaties and obligations could easily be disposed of if His Majesty’s Government would only be ready to 'return^these tribes to their mother country. He denied that he was taking/taking the discussion back to tao situation which existed before the conclusion of the Treaty of Sana'a? but claimed that it was only by placing our relations as soon as possible on a really permanent basis, as a contemplajed in the first paragraph of Article 3 of the Treaty, that Anglo-Yemeni friendship could be assured. 11. Eventually it was agreed that the Prince should put his views in writing in a semi-official letter to me (he showed great reluctance to sending an official note, and as he has no official status for the time being a semi-official letter seemed preferable) c It was agreed that we should await the receipt of this letter before pursuing the matter further. But the Prince (who I think intends to refer to Sana'a again) said it might not roach us for a little time* 12. At one point I asked the Prince whether he was acting entirely on his initiative or on instructions from his father. He replied 'both', but it was clear that he was acting under instructions. 13. At another stage in the conversation, the Prince hinted that he might at some future date be appointed Yemeni diplomatic representative in London* He twice alluded to the prospect of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Yemen and this country as an object which he had very much at heart. 13. The conversation was difficult and confusing, and at several points the Prince and Mr. Mougy, who was interpreting, embarked on long discussions which Mr.Mougy did/did not translate. It also showed a tendency to go -found in circles, which I found it difficult to arrest. 15. As far as I can see, the Prince has no immediate intention of returning to the Yemen, and in view of what we know about the fate which has overtaken his brother Ali&gt; and the attitude towards him of his elder brother Ahmed, it seems more than likely that he may establish himself heste for a very considerable time.

SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE 22nd November 1935* Previous papers :— 3330 1000 12.34 Captain Seager's report containe valuable information on the domestic situation in the Yemen; Cross currents of hatred and jealousy between the lending personalities: Abdulla al Anri, tie virtual dictator of the country; his colleague, Raghib Bey, the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; the presumptive Crown Prince; and the powerful Y/azir family, are perhaps a normal feature of any Oriental despotism and might lead to a series of Palace revolutions which would not have much effect on the world at large# However, the possibility that the civil servants are in the pay of Italy and the efforts of the V/azir Family to enlist British support remove these quarrels from the entirely domestic sphere and may give rise to international/intemotional conplicotions. A further dii turhing feature is the Irtent hostility between the tribe men nnd the Zeidi element which at the moment is the b ckbone o^ the administration. If this animosity were allowed full play, civil disturbances would result which mipht cause complete disintegration of the Yemen. 2. For tie moment the prestige rather than the personality of the Imam is sufficient to keep these discordant elements quiescent, but it is clear that his death will be followed by a period of unrest which would provide a favourable opportunity for intervention on the part of any foreign Power who desired to take advantage of it. (Sgd.) HOOD 4/11. It is a pity that Sir Bernard Reilly does not commit himself in his covering despatch to any expression of opinion on the main points dealt with by Captain Seager (who has only been a year or two in S.W. Arabia) - e.g. the extent of Italian influence at San* a. He said a year ago (paragraph 39 of his despatch at P.Z. 2248/34) that this influence was much exaggerated - and even if it has been considerably strengthened since then it is no doubt exceedingly unlikely that the Yeminis would in present circumstances do anything to encourage Italian penetration. It is to be hoped that the Iman will survive until conditions are more stable in that part of the world. Though, if he does not, his country is no doubt quite as likely to be absorbed by Ibn Saud as by the Italians - who presumably will not be able to add * to their commitments for several years* (Sgd.)

'TLord LAMINGTON rose to ask His Majesty’s Government for information as to the affairs of the Aden Protectorate, also as to our relations with the Imam of the Yjemen subsequent to the signing of the Treaty; and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, for several years I have from time to time raised questions in regard to the Aden Protectorate. Since the signing of the Treaty, I really have had no information as to what has taken place in Aden or the hinterland, and I have, therefore, put this Question down in order to elicit information. I shall be glad to know whether since the signing of the Treaty the Audhali tribe, to which 1 have repeatedly called your Lordships’ atten tion, 'are free from all usurpation by the Imam of the Yemen. I have privately given notice to my noble friend who I understand will reply to this Question, that I should like to know what jwill be the effect upon Aden of Clause 28*7 of the Government of India Bill, which removes Aden from the jurisdiction of India altogether, I under stand. In the past it has always been a problem how Aden would get on should India in its new state impose heavy duties against the import of salt from Aden. The salt business in Aden is one of the greatest resources of revenue for Aden itself. There is another interesting point. I understand that it is now believed that the demand for Aden salt is so very strong in India, particularly in Bengal, that there will be still a veiy important export of salt from Aden to India. In the past the Government of India, the Government of Bombay, the War Office and the Colonial Office have all had their fingers in the pie. I do not know whether it has been con templated in this re-settlement of the ad ministration that there should be a separate Department dealing entirely with the Arab-speaking people in that part of the Near East. I will not go into detail further than to say that to the North of Iraq, down to Aden, on the east Persian Gulf and west of the Egyptian Frontier you find practically one set of people who speak the same language, Arabic, and are of one religious creed. It seems to me, therefore, very desirable that there should be a separate Department dealing en tirely with these Arab-speaking States. By that means you would be able to set up a cadre of officials who could be posted to that large area. At present each Department which has dealings with any of these Arab-speaking States has to find some special official; there is no service from which they can draw people who know Arabic and have experience of the area. I will not say more at the present moment, but will content myself by put ting the Question standing in my name. The PARLIAMENTARY UNDER- SL( RET ARY of STATE for the COLONIES (The Earl of Plymouth) : Mj Lords, your Lordships 'all know what a very strong interest my noble friend Y 1935 ] Protectorate 376 Lord Lamington has taken in the question of Aden in the past and its relationship with the King of the Yemen. I am there fore very glad that I am in a position to give him what I hope he will consider a more satisfactory reply than I have been able to give on some past occasions. A Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Co operation was signed with the King of the Yemen on 11th February, 1934. This Treaty was ratified on the 4th September in the same year. The noble Lord will, I am sure, have seen and read that Treaty. Before the Treaty was signed the King evacuated those parts of the Aden Protectorate including the Audali Terri tory which for some years previously he had occupied. He returned the hostages which he had held, and he agreed to lift the embargo which had previously existed upon trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate. Since the signature of the Treaty relations with the King of the Yemen have been cordial and are better than they have been for a long time past. A Frontier Officer was appointed to the staff of the Aden Residency after the signature of the Treaty and this officer co-operates with the Yemeni frontier officials, and questions of frontier relations have been amicably adjusted in this way. The Frontier Officer also pays periodical visits to Sanaa and discusses with the Yemeni officials there any ques tions that need adjustment. Every effort is being made to make the trade routes in the Protectorate secure so that trade between the tw'O countries may develop. As regards the present working of the administration in the Aden Protectorate, the noble Lord will probably be aware that there is no direct administration in the Protectorate. The various Sultans are in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government and the Political Officers on the Staff of the Aden Residency maintain contact with the Chiefs and tribes and assist in the settlement of disputes. Com munication with the outlying parts of the Protectorate is becoming easier year by year owing to the greater ease with which the more distant areas can now be reached by air. Efforts are also being made to develop more progressive ideas amongst the tribes. A college for the edu cation of the sons of the Chiefs of the Protectorate or their near relatives has been established at Aden. Moreover, a system which already exists of trainingdii i liabjiif\ ujj^rfthat my rate, in larger ng which i amount 3 of the ;her than yed of a he locali- 378 iS raised, 'peration ny years, lifted to ves from tectorate for ser- Eritrea nths ago permis- n umbers v of the Italy it ould not 3 I have udge we hat part ray upon iiich the , in con- er of the y’s Gov- as been speaking y’s Gov- Middle -namely, Colonial las been of occa- s’ House pretty ms ex- fficulties f adopt- [ should it there ; years, Depart- snt with linating was an I think, d, when Colonies ag quite nstances asion to stem by tained. ords, I term a he con- ectorate vith the 3 e bene- hat the ive now 51^ a-,.. „ ^ ( f rrC^- tUsWti, * 4 Uc: 1+n) 379 Malta: Proposed [ 15 July been freed from oppression by the Imam. It is satisfactory to know that a college is going to be started in Aden for Chiefs’ sons coming from the Protec torate. I only wish that some kind and humane people would also start a hos pital on the Isthmus there : it would have a tremendous effect in drawing people from the far interior to have medical treatment. Even now, they sometimes come from the Yemen right down to Aden. It would have a most beneficial effect, not only in doing good by giving medical treatment, but also in maintain ing satisfactory relations with various tribes. Referring to that other point about having a special Department concerned with the Arab-speaking people, I am glad to hear that this co-ordinating body between the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office The Earl of PLYMOUTH: All Departments that may be concerned. Lord LAMINGTON : It seems rather anomalous—I have often drawn your Lordships’ attention to it—that the Colonial Office should be concerned with a vast number of questions that arise with foreign countries. Taking Palestine, for example, I do not know whether the Colonial Office deal with Saudi Arabia, or whether that has been handed over to the Foreign Office, but certainly Ibn Saud objected very sti’ongly to having anything to do with the Colonial Office. He called himself an independent monarch, and therefore wished to have 1 relations with the Foreign Office. I should have thought that in the same port there might be a cargo of officers who could be posted anywhere in these great Arab-speaking countries. It would be , worth anything to get one Department to deal with that subject. It 1920 it was proposed that the Foreign Office should have a special Department to deal with the matter, but for some reason or other that fell through. I believe Lord Curzon was, at one time, very strongly in favour of the idea that the Foreign Office should have the matter in hand. It does seem anomalous that only in the case of Aden, and, I suppose, of Palestine, the Colonial Office should have its officers there. I should have thought that it would have been better for the whole administration of our relations with foreign countries had it been nlaced under one Department of State, but it is very good news to hear that there is a co-ordinating authority now to meet together to deal with these questions.

It has been ascertained from Lord Lamington that the points which he proposes to raise in addition to relations with the King of the Yemen are (i) whether the Abyssinian crisis has reacted upon Aden affairs; and (ii) how the present system of administration works. A brief has been prepared here for Lord Plymouth’s use, and I enclose a copy, for any comments which you may have to make. As J. G. LAITHWAITE, ESQ., C.I.E.' As regards the Abyssinian crisis, you will see that we have included a paragraph about the recruitment of natives. It is understood that Lord Plymouth will probably not wish to mention this particular point unless Lord Lamington refers to it himself, which is perhaps unlikely. If, however, Lord Lamington does ask for information on this point, we suggest that the reply should be on the lines of the paragraph in the brief. We understand that Lord Lamington may possibly also refer to the future position at Aden. It seems unlikely that he will specifically ask for information as to the future administration of the Settlement after transfer, as his question refers only to the Aden Protectorate. We have, however, prepared a paragraph on this point for use by Lord Plymouth if required. It would seem more appropriate that any discussion on the future administration of the Settlement should take place on Clause 287 of the Government of India Bill. This Clause has, however, already been considered in Committee in the House of Lords and there v/as no discussion upon it. If, by chancechance, Lord Lamington raises this point, we suggest that the ansv/er should he that this aspect of Aden affairs hardly arises on Lord Lamington’s question, but that if he wished for more detailed information on this point he should put down a separate question on the matter. I am writing similarly to Malcolm. Yours sincerely,i (1) d elations with the ,Yeme&amp; » A Treaty of Priendshir) and l/utual Co~o ©ration was signed with the King of the Yenen on the 11th February, 1934s this Treaty was ratified on the 4th September, 1934.

(3) ^resent nd . Q-giUon at .Mga . His Majesty’s Government have been responsible since 1927 for the defence of Aden and for political relations with the Protectorate, ^he Aden Settlement is part of British India and is administered by the Government of India* There ie f however, as Lord Lamington will know, in the Government of India bill at present before Parliament a clause providing that the Chief Commissioner*s Province of Aden (that is, in effect, the Aden Settlement) nay be separated from India and that Hie ila^esty may by Order in Council provide for the future administration of the Aden Settlement. If this clause becomes law and the proposed separation takes place, the Intention is that the Secretai’y of State for the Colonies should assume responsibility for the administration of the Aden Settlement. His Majesty’s Government would then be entirely responsible for the whole of the Aden area? they are already responsible forthe defence of Aden and relations with the Protectorate and they would take over from the Government of India the administration of the Settlement* Go far ae it is possible to ^udge at present this should not affect at all our position in the Protectorate which should continue much as heretofore* (jf) Italo-Abysslnlan crisis: —reaction on, So far, the Abyssinian crisis has not reacted much upon Aden. A system has been in operation in the past for many years whereby the Italians were permitted to recruit a certain number of natives from certain parts of the Aden Protectorate and also ^enenis through Aden for service with the Italian forces in Kritrea and Italian Somaliland. Some months ago the Italians made a request for permission to recruit natives in excess of the numbers formerly permitted, and, in view of the strained relations between Abyssinia and Italy, It was decided that this request could not be acceded to. Notification was accordingly given both to the Italian and Abyssinian Governments that the recruiting of British subjects and British protected persons at Aden and also of Yemenis through the Port of Aden could not be permitted, and the two Governments were asked to co-operate in not enlisting such persons in their forces. Beyond this particular question, we have not received any information to indicate that the Abyssinian crisis has reacted upon Aden affairs in other ways.^■1 Reference Paper.

His report that the King had given orders that the Mission was to receive the same reception everywhere as that given to Sir Bernard Reilly’s Mission was not only unexpected, but disturbing, in view of the fact that insufficient funds had been brought to live up to the reception. He was followed closely by Qadhi ‘Ali al 'Amri, brother of the Prime Minister and Secretary to the Governor of Hodeida, the new Port Officer, Muhsin Galala, late barber to the King of Yemen, and 'Abdullah 'Uthman, ‘Amil of Zeidiya, who arrived on board to call and to extend a welcome to the Mission. Aden—(C. 15301/80). 24. 24.3. Shortly after they had returned to the shore the Mission, accompanied by Captain Hermon Hodge, landed, the landing being somewhat precarious owing to the dilapidated condition of the swinging iron steps leading from the sea to the jetty. After being welcomed on the jetty by the Officer Commanding the Forces and other officials, the Mission proceeded past drawn up troops and interested spectators to the Government Court House, which had been reserved for our use, and were received there by Seiyid ‘Abdullah ibn al Wazir, the Governor, who gave us a warm welcome. Accompanied by Lieutenant Morphew and Mr. Salih Ja'far I returned the Governor’s call at 5 p.m. I found with the Governor Sharif 'Abdullah ad Dumein, a charming old gentleman who had commanded the Imam's forces in the Yemen advance against Marib and Al Joba in 1930 {vide paragraph 1339 of Political Intelligence Summary*). The heat in Hodeida was intense. Qadhi All sat down to dinner with us and the band played during dinner. 4. Early the next day, after a sticky night, and one not entirely free from mosquitoes, we proceeded by cars on the first stage of the journey to San'a. Our destination that night was Ma'bar {vide Sir Bernard Reilly’s report), but owing to mishaps en route, we were unable to reach there by nightfall and bivouacked on the motor-track not far from Madinat Al ‘Abid. Qadhi ‘Ali came with ns to San'a. The country after leaving ‘Ubal, as far as the summit of the Masna’ Pass was magnificent, and, green and fresh after the rains, with a profusion of standing crops and running streams, was at its best, while the grandeur of the flanking mountains, verdant and wooded, added to the beauty of the scene. 5. The next day, 1st September, we reached Ma'bar at about 11.30 a.m. and were hospitably entertained by the ‘Amil of the District, Seyid Ahmed al Jirafi. His head quarters are at Dhoran, under the pinnacle summit of Jebal Dhoran (10,000 feet), a landmark from the Dhamar plain, and he had come over to Ma'bar especially to receive us, having had everything ready for our comfort the previous night. I expressed an apology as best as I could for the inconvenience caused him by our delayed arrival. After a hasty change from our travelling clothes to . clothes more in keeping with our anticipated reception in San'a, we left Ma'bar in our cars at about 1.30 p.m. for the last stage of 3^-4 hours. The ‘Amil accompanied us. About two miles out of San'a, we were met by a party of cavalry who accompanied us from here onwards. After entering the walls of the city by the gate called “ Bab as Sabah ” we alighted from our cars and I was met by the Officer Commanding the Troops drawn up to receive us, who were lining the route from the gate to our residence, the Turkish Court-house called As Sanaya ', where the Clayton Mission was lodged and also that of Sir Bernard Reilly. On arrival we were welcomed by the Prime Minister, Qadhi ‘Abdullah al ‘Amri, and the Foreign Minister, Qadhi Muhammad Raghib Bey. Tea and coffee were served, while the band discoursed sweet music outside, the pieces played ranging from a tune which one or two of us recognized as the old familiar refrain of ‘ ‘ Pop goes the weasel! ’ ’ to the British and Yemeni National Anthems. Unfortunately, none of us knew the latter, and only one of us recognized the former, so we failed to honour them by standing up. 6. The next day, 3rd September, Qadhi Raghib payed me a call to discuss our first audience with the King. I had suggested that this should be in the nature of a visit to pay our respects on arrival and that the more ceremonious visit for the exchange of the Ratification documents should take place subsequently. But the Qadhi explained that it was the King of the Yemen’s wish that, as I was the bearer of a document containing the signature of the King of Great Britain, the first visit should be for the purpose of handing over this document. Also, the King of the Yemen was residing at present at Ar Rodha, the grape-garden city five miles outside San'a, and preferred not to have to come in to San'a and have the troops turned out twice. 7. On 4th September, at about 10 a.m., I proceeded to the palace, accompanied by Wing-Commander Knowles, Lieutenant Morphew, Mr. Salih Ja'far, and the two Arab orderlies. All except Mr. Salih Ja'far were in uniform. The streets were lined with troops and interested spectators. Qadhi Raghib met us at the door of the Palace and conducted us along the corridor to the audience chamber at its end. We had arranged to get there early in order to compare carefully the two Arabic copies of the Treaty and especially the two Arabic versions of the Ratification clause. The exact wording of His Majesty's Ratification was necessarily not followed by the King of the Yemen as he has his own form of Ratification similar to that which he has used in * No. 79252/30 [Enclosure in No. 181].3 ratifying Treaties with other foreign Powers. But it was necessary to ensure that the main points contained in His Majesty's Ratification, of which there were three, should be contained in that of the King of the Yemen. 8. The King gave me a very cordial welcome, after which Wing-Commander Knowles and Lieutenant Morphew were presented. The Ratification documents were then exchanged without any loss of time while the King was still standing and before he had sat down at his dais. I presented His Majesty’s document first, opening the document at His Majesty’s signature and the Royal Seal, showed it to the King and then, closing it again, replaced it in its case which I gave to His Majesty. After which, the King presented to me his document in a similar manner. He then sat down at his dais and I made a short speech to the King, a copy of which is attached. Towards the end of my speech, Lieutenant Morphew had taken His Majesty’s gift of a sword from its case, and on its conclusion, he handed it to me with the sword half-drawn and the Arabic inscription facing the King, and I presented it, the King standing up to receive it. The King was then graciously pleased to reply to my speech, after which he took his departure. The King was evidently very pleased with His Majesty’s gift and particularly with the Arabic inscription on it. The King, in his reply, dwelt on his pleasure that the Treaty was finally concluded and expressed a hope that it would lead to the better co-operation between the two Governments. He also expressed his gratitude to Sir Bernard Reilly for having taken so much pains to bring it about. The King appeared to be in good health and good spirits, but it seems that the report of his recent serious illness was not exaggerated. 9. On Wednesday, 5th September, Qadhi Raghib Bey came round to our residence, and he and I spent all the morning discussing certain matters. In this report, I will only mention those which are the direct concern of His Majesty’s Government, and deal with the others which have a more local connexion in the form of a short note in their respective Residency files. 10. Qadhi Raghib opened the proceedings at some length and the gist of his talk was an apology for the Yemen Government, which he described as a young child not yet grown up, and the inefficiency of certain local governors on the frontier, who were holding their posts for the reason that there were, at present, no better people to replace them. 11. Questions discussed were : — 1. The best means for improved communication between Aden and San'a, viz., by wireless, as directed in Colonial Office despatch of 9th August, 1934*. 2. Facilities for the purchase by the King of munitions from His Majesty’s Government or British firms should he so desire it. (Colonial Office despatch of 20th November, 1933f). 3. The appointment by the King of a Frontier Officer. 4. The increase of the export tax on goods exported from Hodeida by foreigners from 10 per cent, to 20 per cent. 12. With regard to 1, I explained to the Qadhi how the Resident had recently represented to His Majesty’s Government the King’s desire for the establishment of a link between the telegraphic systems of the Yemeni Government and the Eastern Telegraph Company and had recommended a modification of the Company s terms. I went on to inform the Qadhi of His Majesty’s Government’s reply as contained in the above-mentioned despatch, and that, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, the best method for establishing communication with the Yemen will probably be by wireless from Aden should Messrs. Cable and Wireless Ltd. establish a station there. The Qadhi replied that he did not think the King would agree to this for fear of offending the Italian Government and that what the King would prefer would be for His M aiesty ’s Gove rnmen t to l i iffi u p th^el^^h system of Aden wi th the telegr aph land-line at Ta'iz which would be extended to the frontier. I pointed out certain objections to this from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, chief of which was one of finance, though the Qadhi gave me to understand that the King would be willing to lay the connexion to Aden himself and pay for it if permitted by His Majesty’s Government to do so. I was rather surprised at this fear of offending Italian susceptibilities and in considering the matter later on in the day I thought perhaps that I had not made myself quite clear and that the Qadhi had thought that it was intended to erect a W/T station ♦No. 37952/34 [No. 12]. t No. 17957/33S. [No. 148] (See 37919/34).in Aden solely for use with San‘a. So I sent off Mr. Salih Ja'far to Qadhi Raghib to make clear to the latter that it was probable that a W/T station would be erected in any case by Cable and Wireless Ltd. and that it would be available for communication with San'a. However, the same reply was given which was subsequently confirmed by the King. 13. With regard to 2, in accordance with the instructions contained in Colonial Office secret despatch dated 20th November, 1933, I made it clear to Qadhi Raghib that the King was at liberty to purchase munitions through His Majesty's Government or British firms should he so desire. The Qadhi expressed thanks on behalf of the King. 14. With regard to 3, I told the Qadhi that, acting on his own suggestion to Sir Bernard Reilly, His Majesty's Government had now appointed a special Frontier Officer and that the officer had actually arrived in Aden the previous Saturday. I added that I hoped that the King would appoint one also. The Qadhi replied that the King certainly intended to do so and was looking out for a good man, but that in the meantime he w'ould appoint someone temporary. At the Mission's farewell audience with the King, His Majesty announced that he had appointed the present ‘Amil of Rada’, Seiyid Muhammad ash Shami, who, he said, was a man to be trusted, straightforward and unbiassed. Both Qadhi Raghib and Seiyid ‘Ali ibin al Wazir, Governor of Ta'iz, also spoke highly of him. I understand that his appointment is a permanent one and that someone else will succeed him as ‘Amil. 15. I mentioned 4 rather tentatively to the Qadhi, but Mr. Salih Ja'far had already told me that the latter did not approve of the increased export tax and had agreed that its imposition would affect adversely not only foreign trade but Yemen trade also. He told Mr. Salih JaTar that he thought the King had been ill-advised in this matter. I introduced the subject by telling Qadhi Raghib that certain European business men, having heard that I was going up to San'a, had asked me to do what I could in the way of getting the tax reverted to its normal rate, which was not strictly true, but T had spoken to M. Ries at Aden and Mr. Day at Hodeida on the subject, so as to get some idea from them as to how far it affected their trade. It was obvious, too, that such an imposition was not going to benefit Yemeni merchants as I pointed out to the Qadhi. The result was that the King sent a telegraphic order to Hodeida that evening cancelling the increased tax and I received a note from Qadhi Raghib the next morning saying that this had been done. 16. Our conversations that morning had been interrupted by the ‘Amil of San'a, Seyid Husein ‘Abdulqadir, and the Commander-in-Chief, Seiyid ‘Ali bin Ibrahim, calling on me without previous warning. The former I had met at Hodeida in January, 1926, while with the Clayton Mission. I returned their calls on the Friday morning, 7th September, taking with me Mr. Salih Ja'far. I found both of them delightful personalities, well-read and conversant with recent world events and world politics. 17. On Thursday morning, 6th September, I called first on Qadhi ‘Abdullah al ‘Amn, the Prime Minister, and then on Qadhi Raghib, and, during the visit, I handed each of them the gold watch which had been presented to them by His Majesty King George V. They were both very pleased with the gift and expressed their thanks. I was accompanied by the two other officers and Mr. Salih Ja'far. 18. On Saturday afternoon at 3 p.m. the Mission proceeded by car to Ar Rodha, accompanied by Qadhi Raghib, to have a farewell audience with the King. The visit was informal. On the King entering the audience chamber, and immediately after the usual compliments, the King described his ailments to Wing-Commander Knowles in some detail and askea for his aavic^^^^i^EgyptianDoctorTMjr Hafiz Amin, had previously called on Wing-Commander Knowles and was known to be in attendance on the King and his family. Wing-Commander Knowles was therefore placed in rather an awkward position but evaded the difficulty by promising to hold a consultation with Dr. Hafiz which he subsequently did. 19. The King mentioned certain villages in the re-occupied ‘Audhali territory about the possession of which there was some doubt, the ‘Amil of Beidha claiming them as belonging formerly to the Beidha Sultanate and the ‘Audhali Sultan claiming them as his. They were finally left in ‘Audhali territory, but Sir Bernard Reilly had promised an investigation on his return to Aden which was duly carried out by himself. The King asked me the result of my investigations, and, while admitting that I had not5 been able to hear the Rasasi (Beidha Sultanate) side of the question, I told the King that from enquiries I had made on the spot and the perusal of certain documents, I was satisfied that the villages and territory under dispute properly belonged to the Audhali Sultan but that I considered that further investigations were necessary. The King admitted that he was not conversant with tribal affairs and paid me the compliment of saying that, I, on the other hand, was, and that he would abide by any decision which was passed by the Residency. With a smile, he said that he appointed me his agent in that particular matter, having already, I believe, paid the same compliment to Sir Bernard Reilly. I had already gone through in some detail with Qadhi Raghib the territorial aspect of the question, and had explained the impracticability of the Ahl Ali am Muhammad, the tribe whose territory is under discussion, being acknowledged as Yemeni, even were their rights to be so proved, as their lands extended on either side of the plateau and would be as the blade of a sword dividing ‘Audhali territory on the plateau into two halves. 20. Before the King left the audience chamber, I thanked His Majesty for the hospitality and welcome he had extended to the Mission. 21. On Sunday, 9th September, a week after arriving at San'a, we left to return to Aden overland via Yarim, Ibb, and Ta‘iz. In any case, I considered a few days visit to Ta'iz to be of advantage as there were a good many local matters to be discussed with the Governor. It had been suggested to us, and we ourselves had considered the suggestion, that we should reach Ta'iz via Hodeida (along the road we had come), and from Hodeida through the Tihama by Zabid and Beit al Faqih to Mocha, and so to Ta'iz. By this route we could have reached Ta'iz all the way by car. But the prospect of being bumped through the Tihama from Hodeida, along a flat, dusty, possibly uninteresting road, to Mocha, in the dampest and hottest month of the year was not pleasing, so we preferred the more direct route, especially as it would be new ground to the other two officers and, in spite of forty miles of the route being impossible for cars, would take no longer. 22. We left San'a at 7 a.m., Qadhi Raghib seeing us off, and the Turkish Officer in charge of our guard, Seiyid Muhammad Halabi Effendi accompanying us to the frontier. Troops were lining the road outside the Bab as Sabah, and as we passed the Artillery barracks two batteries were drawn up, one on either side of the road. Our outriders, who had always accompanied our car in drives through the city, now came with us for a distance of about two miles outside the walls, where they took leave. Our destination for that night was Yarim, which we reached about 4 p.m. I found the road from Ma'bar to Yarim considerably improved since I had motored along it in January, 1932. The portion from Ma'bar to San'a now makes a wide easterly detour, thus avoiding the difficult, but direct, route over the Yaslin Pass (9,500 feet) and then via Wa'lan, which was the route used by my car on my last journey. Yarim is a squalid, dirty town, which had been rendered no cleaner by recent rain. The small garrison was drawn up to receive us in front of our somewhat cramped quarters, but before reaching there we had to pass through narrow streets swarming with an interested crowd. At about 5 p.m. the ‘Amil, Seiyid Hashim, came to call and I returned the call just before sunset. 23. We left early the next morning, doing by car the remaining eight miles or so to motor terminus at Qa'a Al Haql, at the foot of the northern side of the Sumara Pass. It was the worst bit of road we had yet encountered, but we got there somehow without damage. The country round Yarmin, which is over 8,000 feet in altitude, was grand, especially on th e evening of our arrival, when there was a violent thunderstorm raging round the mountain tops. It gave us an insight into the type of country, and the verdure, w'e were still to meet. 24. At the motor terminus we found our riding and baggage mules, with the escort of soldiers and muleteers, awaiting us, and while we had breakfast the mules were loaded up. We started off on our trek over the mountains to our next motor terminus at Sayani, at 9.15 a.m. The Sumara Pass is 9,600 feet in altitude and its summit is the dividing line between the Zeidi and Shafa'i populations, and the Wadi Mahfidh, which is the valley on the Aden side, must be one of the prettiest spots in Al Yemen. We reached Makhadar, which was our halting place for the night, at 4 p.m. The actual going from where we left the cars was 3f hours walking and 4f on the riding mules. By spending the first night in bivouac at Qa'a al Haql (motor terminus) one could make Ibb instead ofMakhadar on the second day, but the King would not hear of us bivouacking m the open rather than accepting the hospitality of Yarim, and so we arranged to do the journey to Ta'iz in four stages instead of three, and to have an easy one between Makhadar and Ibb which would get us to Ibb early and give us time to see that interesting town. At Makhadar the usual calls were exchanged between the ‘Amil (Ahmed Salih as Sabari) and myself. Almost immediately after we arrived it started to rain and some of our kit, which was behind us, got wet. 25. The next day we proceeded down the beautiful Wadi Suhul to Ibb. On all sides there was a scene of verdure and freshness, and such a profusion of crops as one seldom sees. The mountain slopes were green and wooded, and the country lanes through which we passed were Hanked with hedges profuse in ferns and flowery creepers, thcii giassy banks a carpet of wild flowers. The crimson flowering cactus with which the undulations were covered added a brilliant touch of colour to the scene. On our left, cascading down the slopes of Jebal Ba'dan, were one or two waterfalls, and the actual river bed of Wadi Suhul, with its water rippling over the boulders, resembled a Scotch mountain burn. Yemen in winter, the only season at which I had visited it previously, is striking enough, but Yemen in the early autumn, after the rains, has to be seen to be believed. One hardly expects to find such a paradise in the sterile Arabia of popular imagination, and certainly not within 100 miles of the barren rocks of Aden. We reached the foot of the ascent leading up to the town of Ibb, soon after 12.30 p.m. In actual going, it is just over 3 hours walking from Makhadar and 3^ on riding mules at a walk. Just before we reached the foot the rain, which had been threatening, came down. 26. Drawn up to receive us, mounted on horses and mules, were the leading notables of the town, headed by Seiyid Yahya bin Hasan al Warit, a pleasant, cheery fellow of middle age, the son of the Chief Magistrate. Beyond them was a line of troops, complete with band and buglers, and a fairly large concourse of townspeople. I saluted the row of notables as I passed and then dismounted to greet Seiyid Yahya, who did the same, after which we both mounted again and after inspecting the troops we all commenced the ascent of the hill leading up to the town. There was also present Seiyid 'Abbas, the son of the Governor, aged about 6, a diminutive figure on a large horse, robed in gorgeous apparel. It took us 40 minutes to reach the top, the road being, for the most part, paved with slabs of stone, as are most of these ancient ascents in the Yemen and the Protectorate. The slabs were very slippery after the rain and the mules had difficulty in keeping their feet and making the ascent. I, personally, felt very insecure and would far rather have made the climb on foot. The going was made more difficult by the jostling crowd, mounted and dismounted, but who were all very friendly and in high spirits. The actual town of Ibb is reached after five minutes from the top, and here most of the town seemed to have turned out to view our arrival and the housetops were crowded. We did not enter the town, but went past it, up a slight incline on the top of which is the old Turkish barracks and hospital. Seif al Islam Hasan, one of the King’s sons, turned the barracks into a residence a few years ago and guests are usually lodged there now, as I myself was 2| years ago. From here one looks down on the town a few hundred yards distant. But it did not look the same Ibb as I had known it in January, 1932, and January, 1926. Then, with its whitewashed, seemingly many-storied houses, it looked like an iced-cake nestling under the towering slopes of Jebal Ba'dan, or, as Mr. Amin Reihani more poetically describes it, ' like a pearl surrounded by emeralds ”. - Now the rains had removed all the whitewash leaving dirty streaks on the outside. But though tn^ursia^ippearanc^u^n^owiHiaxHietenomtedTllound later that the inside, with its cobbled narrow streets, picturesque archways and tall houses, remained as attractive as ever, like some mediaeval village in southern France, and still one of the cleanest places in the Yemen. A truly fascinating town in a gorgeous setting. 27. After lunch, the Governor, Seiyid Yahya bin ‘Abbas, a nervous weak-looking man, who used to be posted at Qa'taba, came to call, accompanied by his small son, ‘Abbas, Seivid Yahya bin Hasan, the Chief Magistrate’s son, and one or two other notables. Conversation was rather difficult, though the Governor was very friendly. I returned the call later on in the afternoon, accompanied by Lieutenant Morphew, after which we were shown the town and its bazaars and were taken to see the famous old aqueduct which brings an unfailing supply of water from Jebal Ba'dan to the town.7 As the Governor had hinted to Mr. Salih Ja'far that we should call on the Chief Magistrate, we did so before returning to our quarters, although it was already sunset. We got a most effusive welcome from both father and son. I found that I had met before the son, Seiyid Yahya, (whom I have already mentioned above), while he was 'Amil of Ma'bar in 1926. 28. We left Ibb the next morning, 12th September, and arrived at Sayani, the motor terminus for Ta'iz, at 12.45 p.m., travelling over the Muharras Pass down to Wadi Nakhlan. The actual going was 3^ hours on foot and 4| hours on mules. Awaiting us at Sayani was Seiyid Muhammad az Zabara, who used to be the Yemeni representative in Cairo. I had last seen him at the Residency Office just before leaving for San'a, when he intended to go to Cairo. But, hearing of the serious illness of the King, he Had postponed the journey and had hastened towards San'a, cutting short his journey at Ta'iz on news of His Majesty’s recovery. With him were three touring cars and a bus for our baggage. He had a tent ready pitched for our reception, with lunch laid out in it. 29. The road from Sayani to Ta'iz was the best which we had yet been over and I, personally, was amazed at the improvement effected since my last journey along it in January, 1932. It was evident, too, that a lot of work had been put into it quite recently. We had a comfortable, smooth drive of over 40 miles which we did in about two hours, arriving at Ta'iz at 4 as we had arranged. There was the usual display of troops, with the band. One can always rely on being made very comfortable at Ta'iz, and this time was no exception. Seiyid ‘Ali’s house at the barracks, about f mile outside the town, was put at our disposal. It was here that the Lady Doctor and nurses were quartered when the Medical Mission to Ta'iz was despatched in January, 1932, to attend His Majesty’s grand-daughter. Unfortunately, our arrival was marred by the news of the death of one of the sons of Seiyid ‘Ali that morning. He was aged 7 and died of tuberculosis. Consequently Seiyid 'Ali did not come up and give us an informal welcome as he would otherwise have done, but after tea I went across, accompanied by Lieutenant Morphew, to visit him and offer him our condolences. 30. The next morning, 13th September, Seiyid ‘Ali came up to the ante-room to see us and brought with him the 'Amil of Ta'iz, Seiyid Ahmed bin ‘Ali, an old friend of mine and brother of Seiyid 'Abduljalil, Governor of Mocha. We returned the ‘Amil’s call in the town of Ta'iz at 11, and he showed us round his garden. We then went on to return the call of the Italian doctor, Dr. Bertroni, who had visited us on our arrival. 31. The extreme friendliness of the officials and Shafa'i population at Ibb and Ta'iz was most noticeable. The whole atmosphere was much more companionable than in the more northern Yemen towns in the Zeidi area. Hearty a welcome as we were given in -San'a, the usual aloofness of the minor officials and general population was still noticeable. The reason for this stand-offishness is the prohibition by the King against visitors to His Majesty’s guests or allowing anyone to entertain or receive a visit from his guests without His Majesty’s permission. Neither is anyone, even though he may be a former acquaintance, permitted to hold conversation with His Majesty’s guests should he meet them in the streets. On the other hand, it was definitely noticeable how many more people greeted one with a salute in passing. However much the attitude of friendliness at San'a may increase, the attitude of suspicion, handed down by San'a’s Lord and Master, will die hard. 32. Seiyid ‘Ali and the Italian doctor joined us at lunch that day, and after lunch Seiyid ‘Ali and I, with Mr. Salih Ja'far, discussed questions of local interest in connexion with border and tribal differences and the passage of motor traffic by the new road between Aden and Ta'iz. 33. On the evening of Friday; 14th September, SeiyicF*Aii came up to the anti-room to say good-bye, as we were leaving early the next day. We had received the usual hospitality and comfort which one has learnt to associate with Ta'iz and its broadminded and friendly Governor. The country round was looking its best, in spite of the rains that year having failed to a certain extent. A car was put at our disposal and also horses to ride. 34. We left Ta'iz at 6.30 the next morning, 15th September, in three touring cars and a bus for our baggage. The route leads, to begin with, along the Mawiya road and turns off right handed just before A1 Janad. It describes a big detour to the north-east- east and south-west and if a more direct route could be found through the low foot hills east of Jebal Sabar about 20 miles would be saved in distance, though not much would8 be saved in actual time unless the Governor of Ta'iz was prepared to construct a really well made road at great labour and expense, as the present route avoids physical difficulties with the result that motor traffic can proceed along it with average speed. I tentatively suggested to Seiyid ‘Ali, who had told me that various alternative routes had been reconnoitred and found unsuitable, that a reconnaissance from the air made by an engineer would be the best means of discovering the most suitable route, and if he would like us to assist him in this I would tell the Resident. He replied that, at present, he knew that the King would not agree to machines flying over Yemen territory for any purpose, but perhaps later on he might, and I expressed a hope that he would let us know if he wanted our assistance and we should be only too pleased to give it if possible, for which he thanked me. But it was evident that Seiyid ‘Ali had already been put to considerable expense over the construction of the present route and, such being the case, it is unlikely that he will wish to construct a new one. 35. We reached the frontier (53 miles) in just under 4 hours actual going, but could have done it comfortably in 3| if our driver had not dawdled at the start. At the frontier we found Captain Seager, the Frontier Officer, and we transferred into the cars which had been sent out from Aden. It took us another 3£ hours actual going to reach Lahej, which is 47 miles from the frontier, and we reached Aden, where our party broke up, at 4.30 p.m. The Mission met with a very cordial reception everywhere. 36. The change of attitude of the Yemeni officials and their broader outlook on life generally was very noticeable in contrast to their bearing at the time of the Clayton Mission and when I visited San‘a in January, 1932. They seemed to realize that there were other countries in the world besides the Yemen and that the Yemen is only a very small portion of the universe, and very backward. Instead of a constant attitude of suspicion of foreign interference and a desire to live in a world of their own, desire for progress has arisen and the realization that such progress cannot be attained without outside help. In this respect, there appeared to be a very genuine sense of relief that the Treaty with Great Britain had been successfully concluded and a genuine wish that Great Britain should be the Power to whom the Yemen Government should turn to assist her. I made a point, at every opportunity, of assuring the King, and others, of His Majesty’s Government’s willingness and desire to assist the Yemeni Government to the best of its ability. The Foreign Minister’s apologies to me for the inefficiency of the Yemen Government, as it is at present, and for the ineptitude and, in some cases, local-mindedness of the King’s governoi;S and ‘Amils, indicated a realization of the country’s failings and weakness. But though these failings are apparent to all thinking Yemeni officials and the desire to eliminate them is sincere, any attempt to do so must be gradual as long as the present autocratic ruler, whose suspicion of Government reform and whose conservatism are still factors with which to reckon, is alive. 37. A very noticeable feature of the King’s policy is his fear of permitting anything which might offend Italian susceptibilities. In this he is probably influenced by his Treaty with the Italian Government which was the first Treaty ever made with a European foreign Power and by his consequent disinclination to grant any concession or to approve any suggestion put forward by another foreign Power which he would not be willing to grant to Italy. As instances of this are Sir Bernard Reilly’s tentative broaching to Qadhi Raghib of the subject of constructing a landing ground at San'a {vide Sir Bernard Reilly’s Report), my own mention of the same subject in January, 1932, with regard to a landing ground near Ta'iz (desired by Seiyid Ali, the Governor), the King’s refusal to allow a Political Officer to be stationed at San'a on behalf of His Majesty’s Government (though were it not for thoughts of Italy he would probably welcome one), his present objection to the proposal of His Majesty’s Government that direct W/T communication should be established between Aden and San'a {vide supra), and his protests should any aircraft transgress his frontier. To any such proposals as those mentioned above the reply is usually given that “ the present time is not suitable but that after a year or two it is hoped, etc.”, and one wonders whether the Imam’s Treaty with the Italian Government, which expires in September, 1936 (or May, 1936, if Moslem years are considered), may not influence the reply and that the construction which can be placed on it is that the Treaty will probably not be renewed.38. As regards succession to the Imamate, although the King’s eldest son, Seif al Islam Ahmed, has been proclaimed Crown Prince and Heir Apparent, it seems that his ultimate succession is by no means certain. Although he is said to have the strength, he is not popular and his cruelty and tyranny are likely to cause a revulsion of feeling against his rule and a dread of the future when the reins of Government are in his hands. Of the Imam’s other sons, Seif al Islam ‘Ali is probably the one who would receive the greatest support, as he is very popular. He is nominally “ Minister of Finance ” in the Yemen “ Cabinet ”, but, I believe, lately got into trouble with his august father for failing in his duties. Report has it that he is fonder of wine and women than trying to balance a budget. The most favoured opponents of the Crown Prince are the ibn al Wazir family, of whom Seiyid ‘Abdullah is the most likely candidate. At present Governor of Hodeida, he has filled many important posts in the past, the most recent one, of course, being the King of the Yemen’s representative in the peace negotiations with Ibn Sa'ud. He is a man of strong character and fine presence. As far as one can see, he is on quite good terms at present with the Imam, but the Imam makes a point of sending him to places to do a special job which is likely to make him unpopular with the people. Hence his selection of him temporarily as Governor of the Shafa'i district of Hodeida, immediately after the Sa'udi evacuation and Yemeni re-occupation. As is known, the % Shafa'i population of the Tihama proved themselves disloyal during the Sa'udi advance and Seiyid ‘Abdullah, on assuming his appointment, had orders to deal with the people with a heavy hand. It is rumoured that one of the King’s sons is again going to be appointed Governor of Hodeida, and, if true, it will be interesting to see what work the King will find for Seiyid ‘Abdullah. Even should Seiyid ‘Abdullah not consider himself strong enough to make a bid for the Throne, one would not be surprised to find him asserting his independence and proclaiming himself an independent Governor. Seiyid ‘Ali, the cousin of Seiyid ‘Abdullah, who is Governor of Ta'iz, is not eligible for the Throne owing to the loss of one eye. He seems to be on good terms with the King, but himself expresses the opinion that there will be upheavals and contentions for the Throne when the King dies. Another member of the Al Wazir family is Seiyid Muhammad, ‘Abdullah’s brother, who is Governor of the Dhamar district. A new claimant to the future Throne has lately arisen in the person of Seiyid ‘Ali Hamud of Kokaban, of the Qasim branch of the Imam’s family, who is reported to have gained considerable popularity. 39. Wing-Commander Knowles treated a good many patients, at San'a, Ibb, and Ta‘iz, and I have already reported how his advice was sought by the King. At Ta'iz, Seiyid Ali, the Governor, asked his advice about the health of his eldest son, ‘Abdullah, who had been out of sorts for some months with an internal complaint, and the ‘Amil of Ta'iz consulted him with regard to one of his sons, a boy of about 8. As the Italian doctor, Bertroni, was in charge of the cases, Wing-Commander Knowles went into consultation with him about them and suggested that both the invalids should be sent to Aden as soon as possible, the Governor’s son to be X-rayed and the ‘Amil’s son for an operation, and I extended a welcome to them as political guests during their stay in Aden. This was agreed to and it is expected that they will shortly arrive. Lieutenant Morphew, R.A., was granted leave to proceed with the Mission, to which he was attached, and my thanks are due to him for the various ways in which he assisted me. I am also very grateful for the assistance rendered to me by Mr. Salih Ja'far, the Residency Political Clerk at Hodeida. His knowledge of the Yemeni personalities and Yemeni politics was invaluable to me and I was glad to a&amp;k tor and receive his advice. My thanks are also due to Sergeant Nasir ‘Awadh ‘Aulaqi and Private ‘Abdulghafur Muhammad Yafa'i of the Aden Protectorate Levies, who did good work as orderlies. 40. It is regretted that the estimate of the expenses of the Mission as submitted to His Majesty's Government in telegram No. 208 of 6th August, 1934*, has been con siderably exceeded. The reasons for the increase have already been explained in telegram No. 253 of 20th September, 1934f, and the increase is almost entirely due to the necessity for giving larger and more tips and presents and also to an item which was unforseen, namely, the hire of motor transport from the Yemen frontier to Aden. * No. 37922/34 [No. 45]. f No. 37922/34 [No. 52].10 In making out the original estimate, it was not anticipated that the Mission would be received on the same scale of reception as that of Sir Bernard Reilly’s Mission, and consequently provision had not been made for the disbursement of tips and presents except on a moderate scale. It therefore came as something of a shock when I was informed at Hodeida of the King’s order (paragraph 2), and I at once realized that I should have to reciprocate this treatment by an increase of tips and that the recipients also would increase in proportion to the scale of welcome accorded. As it was, I always went very carefully into the question of disbursements at the end of our visits to our various halting places, and usually in consultation with Mr. Salih Ja'far, who had accompanied Sir Bernard Reilly and was able to quote precedents in many cases, and once or twice I cut down his recommendations ruthlessly. As regards the expenditure of £27 on motor transport, as against £12 which would have been the cost of sea passages from Hodeida to Aden, it has already been explained that this was due to the considered advantage of a visit to Ta'iz and a talk with the Governor on outstanding local questions. Personal contact is always preferable to correspondence, and it is hoped that the benefit derived from this visit will be considered to have been worth the extra £15 expended. M. C. L.

[E 5401/22/91] No. 1. Colonial Office to Foreign Office.—(Received August 24.) Sir, Colonial Office, August 23, 1934. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to the letter from this Department of the 23rd March enclosing a copy of a report by the Resident at Aden on his mission to Sanaa for the purpose of concluding a treaty with the King of the Yemen. 2. As a result of correspondence with your Department and the Resident at Aden, it has been decided that the last sentence of the note on the Anglo- Yemeni boundary, which forms the last annexure to the Resident’s report, should be deleted and the following sentence substituted :— “ Beyond this point the boundary, as laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 9th March, 1914, respecting the boundaries of Aden and of Ottoman territory in Southern Arabia, is a line running north-eastwards into the Ruba-al-Kliali (‘ the Empty Quarter ’) at an angle of 45 degrees.” 3. The note on the Anglo-Yemeni boundary as now settled, therefore, reads as follows :— “ Article 3 of the treaty stabilises, pending a final decision, the actual frontier existing on the 11th February, 1934, the date of the signature of the treaty. This is as follows :— “ From approximately Husn Murad to the Wadi Bana it is identical with the old demarcated Anglo-Turkish boundary as shown on official maps of the Aden Protectorate. From the demarcated point on the Wadi Bana, eastwards, it follows tribal boundaries which have never been demarcated in detail on the ground, and which the inaccuracy of existing maps makes it impossible to define precisely on paper, but which are known to the tribes concerned. These are the northern and eastern boundary of the Upper Yafa tribe, excluding Rubeiatein, the boundaries between the Upper Yafa, Lower Yafa and Fadhli tribes and Beidha, the north-western and northern boundary of the Audhali tribe, the western boundary of the Aulaqi tribe, and the western and north-western boundary of Beihan, including the Masabi country. Beyond this point the boundary, as laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 9th March, 1914, respecting the boundaries of Aden and of Ottoman territory in Southern Arabia, is a line running north-eastwards into the Ruba-al-Kliali (‘ the Empty Quarter ') at an angle of 45 degrees.” I am, &amp;c.

My dear Handel, In Cowell’s absence, I write in answer to your letter HoaS.1920/22/91 of the 12th May regarding the treaty settleoaent with the King of the Yemen, in which you call attention to the misleading passage which occurs in the r boundary” Hote attached to the says that ”no boundary has been attempted,” it really means that no boundary has been demarcated : none the less we quite agree with you that it is important, especially in view of the Qatar situation, to alter the Office concurrence, to suggest to the Resident that the last sentence should be replaced by the following Resident’s report. 2 We think it is probable that where the note wording, and we therefore propose, subject to foreign n Beyond G.7 7 . RMD&amp;L , 3S , C.M.G'Beyond thia point the boundary is that laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 9 ^ i&amp;ircsh 19^# but has not been de&gt;aaroated on the ground . 3 . as regards publishing the note, we agree with you that it would be unwise to give the document any sort of publicity, at any rate in its present form. The question, however, arises vhether, when it has been amended, it should then be published. The present intention is that only the treaty itself and the exchange of notes about slavery should be laid before parliament, and we think it would be better to adhere to this arrangement, especially as we do not want to incur any delay. 4 . hen the note haa been amended, however, we do not see any particular objection to its terms being made known: indeed there are as you say, certain advantages in making it public. On the other hand, by that time the opportunity of publishing the note in the Command laper will 2*ave passed. We therefore suggest that even when the note has been amended, we should not take any definite steps to make it public, but that it should be understood that if at any time questions are asked as to what the de facto frontier is, we should give the information. ?or example, a question might be asked in Parliament.Parliament, inother reason which inclines us to the view that we should not take any active steps of our own to publish the note is that it is not likely to be very intelligible to the ordinary enquirer without a carefully prepared caap. 5* I am sending a copy of this letter to Laithwaite and Peck.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Ounliffe-Lister to state, for the information of Secretary Sir John Simon, that he has had under consideration the proposal recently made by the Resident at Aden regarding the appointment of a frontier officer on the Aden Protectorate staff. A copy of the Resident*s despatch on the subject was enclosed in Mr.Blaster*s letter to Mr. Johnstone on the 5th April. 2 . In that despatch the Resident records his riew that it would be preferable to hare, instead of a permanent British representative at Sanaa, an officer posted at Aden under the control of the Resident, whose special duty it would be to establish effective frontier control in the Protectorate in co-operation, if possible, with the Yemeni officials across the border. Sir hilip Cunliffe—Lister has had an opportunity of discussing the proposed arrangement with Colonel Reilly, and he strongly supports the Resident’s reconsaendation. It is understood from semi-official correspondence that the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs agrees in principle to the appoint ment of a frontier officer on the Aden Protectorate staff. 3- The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury have approved the creation of this new post (the emoluments of which will be paid from the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote), and the Resident has recommended the appointment thereto of Captain B.W. Seager, at present British Pro-Consul at Jedda. As THE UHDSR SECRETARY OP STATE, POHEICN OPPICK.As Sir John Siraon is aware. Captain Seager acted temporarily as Political Officer in the Aden Protectorate during the absence of the mission which reesntly went to Sanaa to conclude a treaty with the King of the Yemen, and the Resident reported very favourably on his work in the Aden Protectorate on that occasion* Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister supports the Resident’s recommendation and I am accordingly to request that if Sir John Simon sees no objection the post of frontier officer on the Aden Protectorate staff may be offered to Captain Seager on the terms set out in the accompanying memorandum* It will be noticed that the officer selected will be appointed on a non-pensionable basis for a period of three years in the first instance* 4. Representations have been received from the Resident regarding the importance of filling this post with as little delay as possible, and I am therefore to request that, subject to Sir John Simon’s concurrence, the offer may be conveyed to accepts the post, the Secretary of State will be grateful if he canbe released from Jedda at the earliest convenient date* Captain Seager as soon as practicable* If Captain Seager I am, s ‘ (Signed) H.

NO. 70. 9 3 4 pi l T?33lDHWCT f Aden, 14th Itfaroh, 1934. I have the honour to refer to parographe 3 o nad 36 of my Seoret deepatoh No. 50, dated the 28th February, 1934, in whioh I dealt with the question of future British representation at San’a# The easiest ^?ny for me to explain tny views is to quote what I wrote on this aubjeot in rcy report, whioh was as follows ’’SS. In your secret deapatoh dated the 14th April 1932 I was instructed to urge the appointment of a permanent British representative at San*a after the conclusion of the treaty# The Imam raised objec tions to this proposal in a letter dated the 2 n th June 1933, a translation of whioh was sent to you in the Ag. Resident's despatch No. 164 dated the l2th July 1933# As the point was not further pressed, either to the Ag. Resident or in your latest instructions to me, I concluded that His Majesty's Government do not attach any urgent importance to it# In my opinion, after further consideration, there are certain disadvnntuges flfaioh appear to me to outweigh the advantages of proposal. These are:- (1) a permanent representative at San'a would not have work enough to occupy his tiiue. (2) the appointment of a British representative would almost oertainly be followed by a demand for theUxa appolntmeat of an Italian reproaontatiro f and possibly by similar dsmands from other Oorornments* Those foreign representatives would hare little to do except to wutoh eaoh other's supposed nativities and to compete for Influence with the Iraaizu ( 3 ) the lmam 9 having been recognised as a Kingi would in all likelihood expect the representa tive to have the same status as the British representative accredited to his neighbour and rival, King Ibn Sa'ud, that ie # the rank of a Minister f whioh I anticipate His Majesty's Goveranient would not be prepared to acoord to him* The Italian Governme/it, on the other hand, might have no such objection, if they felt that the establishment of a legation in the Yemen would strengthen their position in Arabia* (4) the appointcamt of a British representa tive at San*a might be balanced by that of a Yemeni representative at Aden. Ky experience of the presence of an envoy from the Imam at Aden from 1921 to 1924 does not enoournge me to welcome this pros- » pect. He gained an influence and authority over the considerable Zeidi element in the population of Aden whioh wa# most undesirable, and hie intrigues with Protectorate Chiefs led to his dismissal* 36* Ky speculations in this respeot may be mlet&amp;kan, but the contingencies that I have mentioned appear to rae to be both possible and likely to be embarrassing* I was thereforeneither surprised nor seriously disappointed when ^adhl I'nhummad Ragheb Bey deprecated my proposal that a permanent British representativerapraaentatlv* should bo sont to San 1 a aftar tha ooaoluaion of the treaty* He baaed the XmaiTi’a objections mainly on the certainty thut the Italian Government would ioamediately maice a similar demand with which he would be most reluot?int to oomply f but which he would be unable to refuse. He suggested as an alternative that a British offioial representative should go to San 1 a from time to time as occasion, demanded 9 and this solution appears to me to be both sensible and sufficient for the present. iadhi ^uhavmad H&amp;gheb Bey realised that disputes and friction arc bound to ooour from time to time between local tribes on the frontier, and that undesirable incidents may result if these are not adjusted promptly by the two oontroiling Governments acting, if possible, in co-operation* For this purpose he proposed to recommend to the Imam the appointment of a special rontior Officer whose duty it would be to visit the border districts and to ensure that causes of trouble were disposed of quickly and In amicable agreement with the British authorities* He asked me for my opinion of this plan, and I told him that It appeared to me to be an admirable one. I added that I should like to be able to employ an officer In a corresponding manner on our side of tha frontier, and that I should submit this suggestion to my Government. I have stated my reasons against the appointment of a permanent representative at f'eu^a. In ray opinion it would be preferable to have an officer postedat Adtn under the control of tho Accident *bo vo uld be available for Oeepatoh to the ‘roteotorato frontier at any point at which there wac a danger of looal trouble which might endanger the harmony of Anglo-Temeni relatione f and who could be sent to san’a at any time that personal dicouaaioa with the Yemeni Government appeared to be desirable* This officer should be in addition to the two Political Officers appointed at Aden for work in the Aden Protectorate, whose duties (which I out lined in my despatch Ho* 266 dated 9th November 1933) would not leave them time for visits to the Yemen. I intend to address you on this subject in a separate despatch, in which I shall submit my proposal in more detail* M 2 . The heritage of many years of uncertainty and lack of effeotive border control is an accumulation of unsettled inter-tribal feuds involving Protectorate and Yemeni tribes along the whole frontier from opposite Perim to where it meets the J 8 «pty Quarter. The establishment of friendly relations with the Yemen now affords an opportunity to endeavour to adjust these disputes, which are a potential cause of serious trouble and of friction between Aden and the Imam* A frontier Officer could find occupation for a long time to oome in this beneficial but generally complicated and difficult task, in which he would have to work in consultation and co-operation with the Imam’s officials across the border. To do this with success he should hold a speolal and permanent appointment of the nature that I am recommending, which will bring him into regular and personal touch with them*3 * Afj I haya explained in the Note on the Anglo- Tetaeni Boundary attaohed to my deapatoh of 26th February, 1934 # the frontier to the east of a point on the adi Bana follows tribal boundaries which haYe never bean demarcated in detail on the ground, and which the inaoouraoy of existing maps muitea it impoeeible to define precisely on paper, but whioh are known to the tribee oonoerned# Although it is not proposed to undertake a formal frontier demarcation at present it is nevertheless important for our own information to ascertain as precisely as possible where the tribal boundaries are, tnid this could be done by a special Frontier Officer in conjunction with the work of aerial photographic survey which is being carried out by the Royal Air ^oroe, and which it is hoped will produce for the first time accurate maps of large parts of the Protectorate. The Officer Commanding the forces in Aden is in ooumunioation with the Air Ministry on this subject, to which he attaches much importance. 4 . I suggest that the officer whose appointment 1 um recom ending be called Frontier Officer and that he should receive emoluments on the srune seal a as those sanctioned for the two Politioal Officers, and that the post be made pensionable on a suitable basis. To some extent the work of the frontier officer and the folitioal Officers should be interchangeable - that is to say, one of the Political Officers should (at the discretion of the Resident) undertake the duties of the Frontier Officer when the latter is absent on leave, and his frontier work when ho is absent at San*a; and in return— - - - - — ■ kreturn tha Frontier Officer could help in performing some of the ordinary duties of a Jolitioal Officer ’hen the latter is on leave, If he can he spared at the time from the opeoial work of his appointment* 5 . I had an opportunity of speaking to you personally on this subject when you landed at *den on February 24th, and cjy conversation with you has enoouruged me to submit my proposal to you offtotally* In the event of it being sanctioned I suggest the name of Captain B*w« Stager, at present British Pro-Consul at Jedda, as suitable for the post* He has recently done good work in the Aden Protectorate, as I have stated in my report on the San f a Mission, and his service under the Foreign Office, and his knowledge of Arabic, French and Turkish should make him an acceptable envoy to send on visits to San*a* I have, &amp;o•, (Signed) B*H.

March 26, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. 1920/22/91] No. 1. Resident, Aden, to Secretary of State for the Colonies.—(Communicated to Foreign Office; Received March 26.) (No. 50. Secret.) Sir, The Residency. Aden, February 28, 1934. I HAVE the honour to submit my report on my mission to the Imam of the Yemen. I.— Preliminary. 2. The composition of the mission was as follows :— Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Reilly, C.I.E., O.B.E. (His Majesty’s Commissioner and Plenipotentiary). Mr. R. S. Champion, O.B.E. (Political Secretary). Lieutenant the Hon. R. A. B. Hamilton (Aide-de-Camp and Transport Officer). Khulussi Effendi Khairi (Interpreter). Mr. C. J. Vyas (Medical Officer). Mr. Saleh Jafar (Political Assistant). Mulazim-al-Khader Mohsin Aulaqi (Assistant Transport Officer). Two wireless operator’s and two orderlies from the Aden Protectorate Levies. 3. The mission, with the exception of Mr. Champion, left Aden in H.M.S. Hastings on the 15th December, 1933. and arrived at Hodeidah on the following day. Mr. Champion was detained at Aden by illness, but was able, fortunately, to leave a week later, travelling by air to Kamaran. and thence by road to Hodeidah and Sana. On landing at Hodeidah we were received by Seif-al-Islam Abdullah, a son of the Imam and Governor of Hodeidah, and we proceeded next day by cars to Mabar, travelling by the old Hodeidah-Sana route as far as Ubal and thence by the new motor road constructed by the Imam about a year ago. This road is a remarkable engineering achievement, and climbs the steep and imposing Yemen mountains to a height of 7,700 feet at Ras-al-Masna, from which point it decends into the central Yemen plateau and joins the Sana- Dhamar-Yerim road at Mabar. 4. We spent the night at Mabar, where we were hospitably entertained by the Amil, Qadhi Ahmed-al-Jiraf, and we reached Sana the following day (the 18th December) at about noon. We were accompanied on the whole journey from Hodeidah to Sana by Qadhi Ali-al-Amri, a brother of the Imam’s Prime Minister. 5. On our arrival at Sana we were conducted through streets lined by troops to our residence, a large Turkish house called “ Sanaia,” where we were welcomed by the Prime Minister, Qadhi Abdullah-al-Amri, and the Foreign Minister, Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey, a Turkish gentleman, whom I had first met at Aden about thirteen years previously in circumstances mentioned in paragraph 6 of my despatch to you. No. 208. dated the 21st October, 1931. 6. Next day, accompanied by Lieutenant Hamilton, I paid a formal call on the Imam, who gave us a very cordial reception. I presented my credentials, which the Imam rose to receive, standing as a sign of respect to His Majesty the King whose signature they bore. After some conversation the Imam stated that he intended to depute Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey to conduct the negotiations with me, at the same time declaring that he relied on me to look after his interests as well as those of my own Government. II .—The Treaty Terms. 7. The negotiations were commenced on the following day. As we were at the beginning of the month of Ramadan, when Sana remains awake at night [56 cc—1] b2 and sleeps in the mornings, it was arranged that our meetings should take place in the afternoons. They usually lasted about two hours. There were fifteen formal meetings, of which all were with the Imam’s Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey, with the exception of one, to which I shall refer later, with the Prime Minister, Qadhi Abdullah-al-Amri. Throughout the negotiations all points of importance were referred by Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey to the Imam for instructions. | 8 . At the first meeting I recapitulated briefly the circumstances in which I had been entrusted with my mission, and reminded the Qadhi of the conditions laid down in the “ admonitory document,” the fulfilment of which by the Imam was essential to the conclusion of a treaty. I said that I hoped above all that my visit would have the effect of replacing the mutual suspicions which had so long existed by mutual confidence, and that my arrival in anticipation of the removal of trade restrictions was an indication of the confidence that I, on my part, was prepared to place in the Imam’s promises. The Qadhi assured me that this confidence would be fully justified. 9. It was agreed that the treaty should be dealt with article by article. The preamble and articles 2 , 4 and 6 presented no difficulty as their wording was already agreed. Our discussion therefore commenced with article 1 . 10 . The point at issue in this article was the Imam’s wish to insert the words ” and his Government” after both “His Majesty the King of Great Britain, &amp;c.” and “ His Majesty the King of the Yemen,” which His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to accept for the reasons stated in the memorandum sent to me with your secret despatch of the 20 th November, 1933. I found that the Imam s strong desire for the addition of these words was based mainly on his impression that no ti’eaty made by Great Britain is really binding unless it is approved by Parliament, and on a confusion in his mind between His Majesty’s Ministers and the Parliament to which Ministers are responsible. Although his views were not expressed precisely in these words, it is evident that he felt that, to make himself secure, he must insist on the treaty being binding on the parliamentary Government of Great Britain, as well as on its SovereigiT and the Qadhi instanced cases in which he believed that Parliament had reversed or altered British foreign policy. I explained that under the British Constitution the treaty-making power is vested solely in the Crown; that it is open to Par lament to censure Ministers for giving bad advice to the Crown, but that Parliament cannot repudiate a treaty which the Crown has concluded. I also explained that the suggestion of a distinction in this respect between the King and his Government might produce difficulties with other States with whicE Great Britain had concluded treaties in the name of the King alone The Qadhi eventually accepted my arguments, but it became clear that the Imam’s doubts had still not been completely set at rest, and I therefore offered to send him, after the signature of the treaty, the note which your memorandum authorises me to address to him on this subject. This satisfied the Imam with regard to British constitutional practice, but not with regard to his own. As an elected and not an hereditary ruler, he felt that the treaty must clearly cover his State as well as himself, and he desired an addition to the note to make this clear, still pressing f or a reference to his Government. This I declined, and the Qadhi then asked whether I could accept an addition of the words “ and his kingdom ” after “ His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam,” which he said'would content the Imam. 1 his proposal did not appear to me to be open to the same objections as Ins original one, and the addition of these words did not, in my opinion make any material difference to the meaning of the article. I therefore decided to agree to their insertion. 11. In article 3 the Imam wished to omit the words “ of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen after “ southern frontier.” I pointed out a •** Til fl ' ontler alone was too vague an expression, and the Qadhi fw\ t n ed T that wa ® s ,°- H , e ^eed to add the words “ of the Yemen,” but said that the Imam objected to the fuller phrase desired by His Majesty’s Government for reasons similar to those which he had adduced regarding his own position in connexion with article 1 . He said that His Majesty’s Government’^ wording suggested his personal possession of the country, and was inappropriate to an elected and not hereditary ruler, and therefore might be prejudicial to him His argument was not very convincing, but the words “southern frontier of the temen had always appeared to be adequate, provided that it was clear from/ the context that the term c ‘ Yemen ” was used in its political and not in its wider geographical sense. I had expressed this view in paragraph 2 (a) of my despatch No. 208, dated the 21st October, 1931, and the three references to the frontier in the second part of article 3 strengthened my opinion that it was obvious that a political and not a geographical boundary was intended. In view, however, of ^the precise instructions contained in your memorandum. I felt it necessary to ask by telegram for your approval. On receiving it, I accepted the words “ of the Yemen.” I was already authorised to agree to the second alteration desired by the Imam in article 3. namely, the omission of the words “ by persons under their protection,” and with these amendments the article was accepted by both sides. 12 . Article 5 proved, rather surprisingly, to be the most contentious in the treaty. I was satisfied that the omission of the words “ from the date of the coming into force of the present treaty ” had no objectionable significance, and I therefore agreed to it in accordance with the instructions in your memorandum, and also to the phrase “ each of the high contracting parties ” instead of “ one high contracting party.” With regard to the Imam’s insertion of “ and judgments ’ after ” local laws,” I found that he really meant not judgments, but judicial and administrative orders and regulations in general. The word decrees ” appeared to be a comprehensive definition of what was intended, and it was agreed that it should be substituted for ” judgments,” it being obvious that the subjects of either party must, when resident in the country of the other, submit to local administrative orders and regulations as w~ell as to local laws and judicial orders. 13. Considerable discussion followed regarding the question of national, as distinct from most-favoured-nation treatment. The question was complicated by the fact that article 5 ( 1 ) refers only to subjects of each of the parties who wish to trade in the territories of the other. Most-favoured-nation treatment is appropriate in matters of trade, but the Qadhi urged that national treatment would not be so, inasmuch as no foreigner in the Yemen is at present allowed freedom in trade equal to that given to natives of the country. It is, for instance, well known that foreigners are not permitted to acquire immovable property, and . the Yemen must make a good deal more progress before this restriction is likely to be removed. I said that I desired national treatment for British subjects as regards their position before the law, and not necessarily as regards trade. The Qadhi argued that this was already secured by the stipulation that they would be amenable to the local laws, which, he said, obviously implied that they would enjoy the protection of these laws, and would have the same legal rights as well as the same legal obligations as the local people. Attempts were made to recast the clause in order to make this point clearer, and also to distinguish between traders and residents or visitors; but I eventually came to the conclusion that it would be better to let the clause stand as it was. 1 here appears to me to be force in the contention that legal equality is clearly implied, and I consider that the clause as accepted is satisfactory. 14. Clauses ( 2 ) and (3) of article 5 gave a large amount of trouble. I discovered that this was due to the fact that undertakings similar to those in clause (2) have been included in treaties which the Imam has contracted or is negotiating with other European Powers; and as the clause gives most-favoured nation treatment, he is extremely averse to admitting in one treaty anv words oi explanations that do not appear in the others, fearing that to do so may expose him to demands for modifications by the other countries concerned. It is for this reason that he disliked the addition of definitions in clause ( 3 ) and especially the definition of “vessels” which appeared to widen the meaning of vessels in clause ( 2 ), the context of which clearly in his opinion confined it to merchant vessels. He objected to the reference to passengers in clause ( 2 ) for the same reason, and also because he feared that undesirable non-British foreigners might obtain advantages from it by coming to the Yemen in British ships. 15. 1 said that I could not agree to the omission either of clause ( 3 ), or of the reference to passengers in clause ( 2 ), and I explained His Majesty's Government’s point ot view with regard to the latter. I also insisted on the phrase “ in the ports of the territories of the other,” instead of the words “ in the ports of the other desired by the Imam in clause ( 2 ). The Qadhi, after further references to tne Imam, gave way on these points, and clauses (2) and (3) were accepted. To meet the Qadhi s wishes I agreed to some alterations in their phrasing. The slight change in the wording of clause (2) makes no difference in its sense. In [56 cc— 1 ] B 2mm 4 clause (3) (b) “persons under His Majesty’s protection” has been changed to “the inhabitants of countries under His Majesty's protection,” because the Imam apprehended that under the former phrase His Majesty's Government might take particular individuals in the Yemen under their protection, a proceeding which I assured the Qadhi was certainly not intended on our part. In this clause the reference to companies also gave rise to much discussion, the Imam being very suspicious of the operations of foreign companies in his£^* territory; but I insisted on its inclusion. The Qadhi on this occasion, as on some others, gave way on the point at issue, but asked for a slight change in the phraseology which did not alter the sense, and which I accepted. Clause (3) (c) contained the vexed question of the meaning of “vessels” in clause (2). On this point I was personally in agreement with the Qadhi that it appeared from the context of clause ( 2 )—that is, from the mention of cargoes and passengers—that the vessels referred to were merchant ships. He argued that this was so clear that it had been unnecessary to stress the point in the Imam’s treaties with other European Powers, but that the proposed definition in clause (3) (c) introduced an ambiguity which was absent from the other treaties in which no definitions were included. After a telegraphic reference to you I yielded this point, on which I myself was inclined to agree with the Qadhi's view, and the word “merchant” has been inserted before “vessels.” 16. Article 7 raised the question of language. Neither the Imam himself nor any of his Ministers or officials has any knowledge of English, and from the outset I have felt certain that the Imam would never consent (except possibly under force) to bind himself by a treaty drawn up in a foreign language incomprehensible to himself and to his advisers. His cautious and very suspicious nature makes it impossible for him to do so, and he is not in the least influenced by the argument that other Arab rulers have taken this risk. My proposal that the English and Arabic texts should have equal force was met by the objection that both could not be decisive if it ever appeared that there was a difference in their meanings. Under the authority of paragraph 12 of your secret despatch of the 14th April, 1932, and of your telegram of the 14th December, 1933, I eventually made the concession which I had throughout regarded as inevitable, and agreed that the Arabic text should prevail in case of doubt. 17. No reference was made on either side to the “ Secret Appendix,” which the Imam had suggested in his letter dated the 20th June, 1933, and which he had already been told in writing was wholly unacceptable to His Majesty’s Govern ment. I do not think that he ever seriously supposed that this remarkable proposal had any chance of success. He has reconciled himself to the omission of any reference in the treaty to his claim to islands in the Red Sea, but * Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey raised the question of this claim in conversation. I followed the instructions on this subject contained in paragraph 5 of your despatch, dated the 20th November, 1933, and refused to discuss the merits of the case, but said that I should be willing, after the signature of the treaty, to receive and to report to His Majesty's Government any observations that the Imam might wish to make; but that I could give no indication of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in this matter. This procedure was accepted, and at my farewell visit to the Imam after the treaty had been signed, he gave me a brief statement of his claim to the islands in a formal note, the receipt of which I acknowledged in writing, but without comment. 18. These discussions with Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey disposed of the terms of the treaty, all of which were finally agreed at our eleventh meeting on the 8 th January. The English and Arabic texts were compared with great care by Mr. Champion and Khulusi Effendi Khairi in consultation with Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey and myself, and I am confident that all possibility of error has been eliminated. III .—The Admonitory Document. 19. We had now reached the crucial stage of the negotiations, namely, the Imam’s compliance with the “admonitory document.” Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey had assured me that there would be no difficulty about this, but there nevertheless was some delay caused by a controversy regarding the Subeihi and Beihan borders. Mr. Champion had on the 4th January given the Qadhi detailed lists showing the names of the villages and sub-sections in the Audhali country5 and the villages in the Sanah area, the evacuation of which was required. He also gave him the names of the Beihani and Audhali prisoners and hostages who were to be released, and a map showing approximately the line which must be established as the status quo before the signature of the treaty. 20. The Qadhi raised no difficulties about the Audhali and Sanah evacuations, the release of prisoners and hostages and the removal of trade ^^restrictions. But on the 9th January he said that the Imam’s advisers had represented that the effect of the British ultimatum of October 1933 had been to advance the protectorate line in the Western Subeihi area to include a number of districts which had never previously been in the British sphere. I was able to show the Qadhi on a map that these districts were on the British side of the old Anglo-Turkish boundary. I admitted that there had been several Yemeni tax collecting incursions into them, but 1 said that the Aden Residency had protested whenever these had come to its knowledge, and that it had never admitted the right of the Yemenis to come south of the old Anglo-Turkish frontier in this area. The British demand made in October 1933 was therefore not a new claim, but one from which His Majesty’s Government had never at any time receded. The Qadhi replied that the Imam accepted the line of the Anglo-Turkish boundary on this part of the frontier, and he professed to be convinced by the evidence of the map which I had shown him. 21. The Qadhi then raised a question regarding the Yemeni-Beihan frontier. He argued that the Masabis have no connexion with Beihan and no treaty with His Majesty’s Government, and that it is therefore wrong to include them in the Aden Protectorate. He maintained that the Masabis are on bad terms with the Shereef of Beihan and are naturally attached to the Qaifa tribe in the district of Rada in the Y r emen, and that the Imam’s troops were wrongly excluded from their territory by British threats of air action in 1931. I replied that His Majesty’s Government’s treaty with the Shereef of Beihan accords protection to him and to his dependents, and that this expression has always been regarded as including the Masabis, most of whose villages are situated in the Beihan valley in such close proximity to the Shereef’s villages that a division of control is impracticable. I denied that the Masabi Sheikh or the majority of his tribe are hostile to the Shereef (though I admitted that one of the minor chiefs was opposed to him), and I insisted that, in any case, I was unable to reopen the question of the frontier in this area, and that the position established in 1931 must be maintained without change. I refused to accept a further suggestion that the Masabi country should be treated as neutral territory. 22. I hoped that my explanations had disposed of the Subeihi and Masabi questions, but, at an interview two days later, the Qadhi informed me that the Imam was still dissatisfied regarding them, that his advisers had convinced him that His Majesty’s Government were making new and unjustifiable claims in the Subeihi country, and that he still pressed his views regarding the Masabi tribe. The Qadhi suggested that Mr. Champion and a representative of the Imam should go immediately to study the Subeihi boundary on the spot. I rejected this proposal, and said that I had given my definite assurance that His Majesty’s Government were claiming nothing more than the old Anglo- Turkish line in the Subeihi country, and that I expected my word to be believed. I also refused to discuss any modification of the Beihan boundary. I told the Qadhi that if the Imam persisted in raising these new issues all our work on the treaty would be frustrated; and I warned him that if my present mission failed, the negotiations would be at an end, and His Majesty’s Government would have to turn to other means of settling outstanding questions. I said that every effort ought to be made to prevent such an alternative* and that His Majesty’s Government were most sincerely desirous of a friendly agreement, but that the time had come for the Imam to decide whether he would honour his promise to fulfil the conditions of the admonitory document. I begged the Qadhi to convince the Imam of the seriousness of the situation in the event of further delay, and asked him to arrange an interview between the Imam and myself if he were unable to do so. The Qadhi asked me to leave the matter to him, and I agreed to await the result of his efforts. 23. During this period the Imam was holding nightly conferences with his civil and military advisers, and I believe that information and maps supplied to him by the Officer Commanding at Taiz at last convinced him that the British claim in the western Subeihi area was justified. He, however, made a final() effort to obtain, or at least to neutralise, the Masabi country. With this object he sent his Prime Minister, Qadhi Abdullah-al-Amri, to see me on the 13th January. This new envoy, an Arab belonging to a distinguished bana family, and a man of very agreeable presence and manners, asked me for a reconsideration of the Masabi question, or for a refeience to London on t e subject, and he also suggested that the British demand for the evacuation of Sanah might be dropped. He appeared to me to realise from the outset that he , had little or no prospect of succeeding in these requests, but (in accordance, no doubt, with his instructions), he pressed them on me for over an hour. I declined politely but steadily to entertain them in any form, and Qadhi Abdullah eventually accepted my refusal, and said that the conduct of the negotiations would now be resumed' by Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey. 24. The latter accordingly came to see me on the 15th January, and informed me that the Imam had decided to comply with the terms of the admonitory document without further delay, and was issuing immediate orders for the evacuation of the Audhali country and the Sanah area, for the release of the prisoners and hostages, and for the removal of his embargo on overland trade with the Aden Protectorate. 'The territories to be surrendered were defined precisely by two lists—one of sixty-four villages in the Audhali country and the other of eight villages in the Sanah area—which had been carefully prepared beforehand by Mr. Champion. The list of Audhali villages was necessarily based on evidence supplied by the Audhali Multan, and it was therefore possible that it might err in favour of the Audhalis. I nevertheless decided to insist on it in its entirety, with the reservation that it might subsequently be corrected after closer enquiry on the spot, which was impossible as long as the Zeidis remained in occupation. On the other hand, the Audhali Sultan had been warned that no villages would be claimed other than those named in the list, and in my demands to the Imam I adhered to the principle of the whole list and nothing but the list. The Qadhi stated that the evacuations and other measures would commence on the 18th January. 25. The embargo on overland trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate was removed punctually on that date, and the banah district was evacuated immediately. The Imam’s orders for the release of prisoners and hostages and for the evacuation of the Audhali country were not obeyed with equal promptitude, and four weeks elapsed before the treaty could be signed. 26. This unfortunate delay was due mainly to the obstructive attitude of the Imam’s Amil at Beidha, whose duty it was to arrange the Yemeni withdrawal from the Audhali country, and to a controversy about certain villages named in the list of places to be liberated. The Amil of Beidha maintained that a number of these, and particularly those in the Shurjan and Am Hajariya districts, did not belong to the Audhali tribe, and his contention was supported at Sana by Seyyid Abdullah-al-Wazir, a former Governor of the Dhamar Province, which included Beidha and the Upper Audhali country. 27. Seyyid Abdullah had come to Sana to take charge of the Imam’s mission to negotiate with Saudi representatives at Abha, and on the 26th January Qadhi Abdullah-al-Amri brought him to call on me. He told me that he knew the country in question intimately, and that there was no doubt that the Shurjan and Am Hajariya districts 'were not Audhali, and he argued that Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey had agreed to their evacuation through ignorance of the locality. I declined at'this stage of the negotiations to modify my demands for evacuation, which the Imam had already accepted; but I informed Qadhi Abdullah-al-Amri that I should be willing, on my return to Aden, to send an officer to the country in dispute to make a local investigation in collaboration with a Yemeni representative; and that, if it were found that any of the places evacuated were beyond the limits of the Audhali tribe, they would be restored. The Imam, to whom this conversation was reported, sent me an assurance that he intended to abide bv his promises to withdraw from all the places named in the list which had been given to him, and said that he was willing to leave the question of the restoration of Shurjan and Am Hajariya to the result of my enquiries, in which he did not wish to participate. 28. The mission was throughout in wireless communication with the Acting Resident at Aden, by whom I was informed of the progress ol the Zeidi evacuation. Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey was kept in touch with the course of events by a daily interchange of visits, usually paid by Mr. Champion on him.10 7 Captain B. W. Seager was sent from Aden to the Audhali country on the 17th January to superintend the reoccupation of the surrendered territory by the Audhalis, and to ensure that it was effected without friction or conflict with the retiring Yemenis. The first villages on the high plateau which constitutes the Upper Audhali country were handed over by the Amil of Beidha to Captain Seager on the 27th January, and the evacuation of all the villages named ^^in the list referred to in paragraph 24 was completed by the 8 th February. All the Audhali hostages had also been released and handed over to Captain Seager by this date. Some doubt continued as to whether the Beihan prisoners had also actually been released. They had been confined at Dhamar, from which place the direct road to their homes did not pass through Captain Seager’s neighbourhood, and it was not until the l()th February that I could satisfy myself of their liberation. IV .—Conclusion of the Treaty. 29. All the conditions of the admonitory document having now been fulfilled, I signed the treaty with Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey on the morning of the 11th February, and at the same time I handed to him the note referred to in paragraph 10 of my report. 30. I and the other members of the mission paid our farewell visit to the Imam on the same day. He received us with great cordiality, and both he and his Ministers were obviously greatly pleased by the happy issue of the negotiations. I read a short speech to His Majesty, a copy of which is attached to my report,^) and he gave me a telegram and a letter, both addressed to His Majesty the King. I despatched the former immediately, and I am forwarding the latter to you under cover of a separate despatch. 31. The mission left Sana on the afternoon of the 12 th February. A ceremony similar to that on our arrival was observed, and the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and other leading State officials came to our house to bid us farewell and to see us off. After a halt for a night at Mabar, we reached N .Hodeidah on the evening of the 13th February. We embarked on H.M.S. Penzance on the following morning, and I there received a telegram from His Majesty the King to the Imam, a translation of which was immediately telegraphed to Sana. 32. After calls at Kamaran and Perim, we arrived at Aden on the morning of the 17th February. I landed officially, and was greatly impressed by the enthusiastic welcome^ accorded to the mission by the people of Aden, who are delighted by the removal of the restrictions on their overland trade and by the conclusion of a treaty of friendship with the Yemen. V .—Subsidiary Questions. 33. A number of subsidiary questions came under discussion or considera tion during the negotiations. Of these, the principal were the future of Rubeiatein, the interchange of British and Yemeni representatives, the slave trade, landing grounds in Yemeni territory and Saudi-Yemeni relations. 34. The question of Rubeiatein was discussed in my despatch No. 253 dated the 16th December, 1931, and in your telegraphic reply dated the 19th January, 1932, you agreed that it should not be regarded as vital. I accordingly raised it, but did not press it. In dealing with the boundary in his interview with Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey on the 4th January (to which I have referred in paragraph 19), Mr. Champion made it clear that His Majesty's Government reserve their right to claim Rubeiatein if they wish to do so when the frontier is finally agreed in accordance with the third article of the treaty. It was, however, obvious that an immediate demand for this district, which has now been in Yemeni occupation for many years, could not be enforced without endangering the success of the negotiations. Rubeiatein has undoubtedly for long been a dependency of the Upper Yafai Sultans, but its people are not Yafais, and their destiny is therefore not a matter of interest to the Upper Yafai tribes as a whole, but only to one of their chiefs, the titular Sultan, who desires the revenue which his predecessors drew from this district in former days. Last year the Sultan’s father made a rash and unsuccessful raid into the country in direct disobedience (') Not printed:8 of the instructions of the Aden Residency, and this unauthorised and embarrassing action made me the less inclined to risk the success of my mission in the immediate prosecution of his claim. I he Sultan’s notorious inability to exercise effective control over his own tribe, or even over his own section of it, added to my reluctance to insist on the restoration of an extra-tribal dependency to his rule. In these circumstances I decided to content myself with Mr. Champion's reservation on this subject. Although the question of Beidhr'~\ was not stressed in the same manner as that of Rubeiatein, I made it clear on more than one occasion that His Majesty’s Government are not precluded by the terms of the present treaty from claiming it and all territory up to the old Anglo- Turkish line in the course of the final settlement. 35. In your secret despatch dated the 14th April, 1932. I was instructed to urge the appointment of a permanent British representative at Sana after the conclusion of the treaty. The Imam raised objections to this proposal in a letter dated the 20 th June, 1933, a translation of which was sent to you in the Acting Resident’s despatch No. 164 dated the 12 th July, 1933. As the point was not further pressed, either to the Acting Resident or in your latest instructions to me, I concluded that His Majesty's Government do not attach any urgent importance to it. In my opinion, after further consideration, there are certain disadvantages which appear to me to outweigh the advantages of the proposal. These are :— ( 1 ) A permanent representative at Sana would not have work enough to occupy his time. (2) The appointment of a British representative would almost certainly be followed by a demand for the appointment of an Italian repre sentative, and possibly by similar demands from other Governments. These foreign representatives would have little to do except to watch each other’s supposed activities and to compete for influence with the Imam. (3) The Imam, having been recognised as a King, would in all likelihood expect the representative to have the same status as the British representative accredited to his neighbour and rival. King Ibn Sand, that is, the rank of a Minister, which I anticipate His Majesty’s Government would not be prepared to accord to him. The Italian Government, on the other hand, might have no such objection, if they felt that the establishment of a Legation in the Yemen would strengthen their position in Arabia. (4) The appointment of a British representative at Sana might be balanced by that of a Yemeni representative at Aden. My experience of the presence of an envoy from the Imam at Aden from 1921 to 1924 does not encourage me to welcome this prospect. He gained an influence and authority over the considerable Zeidi element in the population of Aden which was most undesirable, and his intrigues with protectorate chiefs led to his dismissal. 36. My speculations in this respect may be mistaken, but the contingencies that I have mentioned appear to me to be both possible and likely to be embarrassing. I was therefore neither surprised nor seriously disappointed when Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey deprecated my proposal that a permanent British representative should be sent to Sana after the conclusion of the treaty. He based the Imam’s objections mainly on the certainty that the Italian Government would immediately make a similar demand with which he would be most reluctant to comply, but which he would be unable to refuse. He suggested as an alternative that a British official representative should go to Sana from time to time as occasion demanded, and this solution appears to me to be both sensible and sufficient for the present. Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey realised that disputes and friction are bound to occur from time to time between local tribes on the frontier, and that undesirable incidents may result if these are not adjusted promptly by the two controlling Governments acting, if possible, in co-operation. For this purpose he proposed to recommend to the Imam the appointment of a special frontier officer, whose duty it would be to visit the border districts and to ensure that causes of trouble were disposed of quickly and in amicable agreement with the British authorities. He asked me for my opinion of this plan, and I told him that it appeared to me to be an admirable one. I added that I should9 like to be able to employ an officer in a corresponding manner on our side of the frontier, and that I should submit this suggestion to my Government. I have stated my reasons against the appointment of a permanent representative at Sana. In my opinion it would be preferable to have an officer posted at Aden under the control of the Resident, who would be available for despatch to the ^-^protectorate frontier at any point at which there was a danger of local trouble ^which might endanger the harmony of Anglo-Yemeni relations, and who could be sent to Sana at any time that personal discussion with the Yemeni Government appeared to be desirable. This officer should be in addition to the two political officers appointed at Aden for work in the Aden Protectorate, whose duties (which I outlined in my despatch No. 266 dated the 9th November, 1933) would not leave them time for visits to the Yemen. I intend to address you on this subject in a separate despatch, in which I shall submit my proposal in more detail. 37. On the 24th January I received telegraphic instructions from you to endeavour to obtain the insertion in the treaty of the slave trade clause contained in the treaty which Sir Gilbert Clayton endeavoured to negotiate with the Imam in 1926, or, alternatively, an interchange of notes to the same effect. By this time the terms of the treaty were practically agreed, and I was reluctant to bring forward new demands at so late a stage. I therefore broached this request without pressing it very strongly, which seemed to me at this point to be the best way of securing the Imam’s willing acceptance. Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey denied that the Imam had definitely agreed to the clause in the Clayton draft: he said that it had at that time been reserved for further consideration when the main terms of the treaty had been agreed, and that the Imam would now prefer to give the assurance desired by His Majesty’s Government in the form of an exchange of notes. I consented to this proposal, and translations of my note to the Imam and of his reply are attached to my report. 38. The officer commanding the British forces at Aden had, before mv departure, suggested the desirability of asking the Imam to allow a landing ground for aeroplanes to be made in his territory, preferably near Sana I thought that the Imam would be more likely to agree to one at or near Hodeidah, and I made this suggestion. It was met by the usual plea that permission to the British to make a landing ground would necessitate a similar concession to the Italians, who were very anxious to secure one near Meidi or Salif (opposite Kamaran). Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey said that the Imam was strongly opposed to granting the Italian Government this permission, and he therefore begged me not to press this proposal at present. I did not pursue it further, judging it better to leave it for future discussion if His Majesty’s Government wish to press it. 39. The tension between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia continued throughout the time that the mission was at Sana, and under your instructions I took several opportunities of expressing the hope that direct hostilities would be avoided. I was assured that the Imam was most anxious to find a peaceful solution, and soon after Ramadan a Yemeni mission under Seyyid Abdullah-al-Wazir was despatched to Abha to negotiate a settlement. In my opinion the Imam intended throughout to avoid war, but he was very suspicious of Ibn Saud’s intentions, and wished by a strong show of force, and by delay, to secure the best possible terms for himself. Defeats in Nejran at the‘hands of the Beni Yam prompted him to negotiate, and his knowledge of the attitude of the British and Italian Governments may have inclined him in the same direction. But Italian influence at Sana is greatly exaggerated, and British friendship is too new to carry much weight yet. The Imam is in any case too suspicious of all foreigners to trust much in their advice or to submit his general policy to their guidance. 40. I had anticipated that the Imam might raise the question of the importation of munitions into the Yemen from the United Kingdom, but he did not do so in any form, and I did not allude to it. VI .—General Remarks. 41. It is of interest to note certain factors which have helped to make the work of my mission considerably easier than, for instance, that of Sir Gilbert Clayton in 1926. 42. In the first place, the treaty which it has been my task to negotiate is much shorter than the draft with which Sir Gilbert had to deal. Several clauses [56 cc 1 ] c10 have been dropped which were contentious, cumbersome, or of minor importance, and the number of articles have been reduced from sixteen to seven. Credit for this useful abridgment of the former rather unwieldly document is due to feir Keith Stewart, Sir Stewart Symes and to the Imam himself. 43 . Secondly, agreement has been facilitated by the adoption of Sir Gilbert Claytons proposed dilatory clause regarding the frontier, whereby its present^- position has been stabilised for the period of the treaty, and its final settlement ^ has been postponed for future decision. 44 . A third contribution to the solution of the problem has been the device of the “ admonitory document which has secured the evacuation of territory, the release of prisoners and hostages, and the removal of trade restrictions without hurting the Imam’s feelings by including these points in the text of the treaty. By this means the Imam’s dislike of making any surrender on paper has been circumvented, and His Majesty’s Government have obtained peacefully essential objects of their policy, and have at length honoured in full their obligations to the Audhali tribe and the Amir of Dhala. 45. Fourthly, the Imam’s very real desire to end his long-standing quarrel with the British Government has been strengthened by the increasing tension of his relations with Ibn Saud. He naturally did not wish to be caught between two fires, and the growing danger of war with his powerful northern neighbour made him more ready to adjust his differences with the British in the south. This motive is especially strong now that he and his Ministers are growing concerned about securing a peaceful succession to the Imamate. Some years ago the Imam secured the election of his eldest son, Ahmed, as his heir, but this innovation, which aims at substituting hereditary succession for a purely elective rulership, has still to stand the test of events when the Imam dies, and the Imam is the more anxious to bequeath a stable State recognised by leading Powers and in friendly relations with its neighbours. 46. A fifth cause which has influenced the Imam's policy—and probably the strongest of all—has been his appreciation of British air power. His troops were expelled by air action from the Lower Audhali country in 1925 and from the Amirate of Dhala in 1928. The later operation involved places within his own territory as well as districts which he had seized in the Aden Protectorate, and the deep impression which it made upon him was proved by his immediate compliance with the demands of the A1 Ain ultimatum in 1931 and of the Subeihi ultimatum in 1933. I was authorised to warn the Imam that a failure of my mission would probably result in a solution of the Audhali and Sanah questions by force. I wished, if possible, to avoid the use of this threat, and the whole of the treaty was negotiated without any need to hint at it. But after the treaty terms had been agreed the Imam’s delay in ordering the fulfilment of the conditions of the admonitory document led me (as mentioned in paragraph 22 of my report) to speak seriously to Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey of the dangers of a breakdown. Although it proved unnecessary for me to use language of this nature to the Imam himself, there is no doubt that he realised the situation, and he was therefore anxious to accept the alternative which my mission offered of a friendly settlement with His Majesty’s Government. 47. The mission were greatly impressed by the evidences of the internal strength of the Government of the Yemen. The present Imam had already secured control of the Zeidi highlands while the country was still a Turkish province, but the withdrawal of the Turks at the end of the Great War left the lowlands and some of the mountain districts in a state of chaos. Out of this confusion the Imam has built up a highly centralised State and has established law and order among the unruly tribes. It was interesting to observe the contrast between the complete security in which heavily laden caravans now journey unharmed through the country by day and night with the risks which were formerly run by travellers in the Yemen, and which, unfortunately, are still run in parts of the Aden Protectorate. 48. In conclusion, I wish to emphasise the extent to which the success of the mission has been due to loyal co-operation in their respective spheres of all its members. Mr. Champion’s help was invaluable. He had an intimate knowledge of the subject, and his mastery of Arabic (both spoken and written), and also of French (in which language our conversations with Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey were largely conducted) was of supreme value. I relied throughout on his sound judgment and his good advice, and I desire to commend his services stronglymMMHISl ■■ 1 HH pdhhhb 12 Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Co-operation. Preamble. HIS Majesty the King of Great Britain. Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, on the one part, and His Majesty the King of ^ s ' the Yemen, the Imam, on the other part, being desirous of entering into a treaty on a basis of friendship and co-operation, for their mutual benefit, have resolved to conclude this treaty and have appointed as their plenipotentiaries: His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India : For Great Britain and Northern Ireland : Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Rawdon Reilly, C.I.E., O.B.E.; For India : Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Rawdon Reilly, C.I.E., O.B.E.; His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam : The Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb-bin-Rafiq; Who, having communicated their full powers, found in good order and due form, have agreed as follows :— Article 1.

We therefore hasten to inform your Excellency that the fact that there has been no discussion or reference, in the treaty now concluded, in regard to the well known islands which were occupied during the Great War, and which have not been restored and handed over to the Yemen which is their original mother, will not invalidate or detract from our fundamental and natural proprietory rights over these islands, nor prejudice our complete and absolute reservation and preservation of the said rights. Our clear and legal rights over them will continue firm for ever. We particularly request you to do your utmost by submitting this our representation to your great Government, and we ever hope that you will use your best endeavours in this matter.

ARTICLE 3 of the treaty stabilises, pending a final decision, the actual frontier existing on the 11th February, 1934, the date of the signature of the treaty. This is as follows :— From approximately Husn Murad to the Wadi Bana it is identical with the old demarcated Anglo-Turkish boundary as shown on official maps of the Protectorate. From the demarcated point on the Wadi Bana, eastwards, it follows tribal boundaries which have never been demarcated in detail on the ground, and which the inaccuracy of existing maps makes it imposmble to define precisely on paper, but which are known to the tribes concerned. These are the northern and eastern boundary of the Upper Yafa tribe, excluding Rubeiatem, the boundaries between the Upper Yafa, Lower Yafa and Fadhh tribes, and Beidha the north-western and northern boundary of the Audfiali tribe, the western boundary of the Aulaqi tribe, and the western and north-western boundary of Beihan, including the Masabi country. Beyond this point lies the Ruba-al-Khali (the “Empty Quarter”), in which no boundary has been attempted. o *B ‘ 12b INDEXED Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Undek Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted :— -. .3 y y ^ A / w Reference to previous correspondence: Letter to from the Colonial Office of the Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

The successful conclusion of the treaty ^ negotiations with the Imam of the Yemen was reported on P*Z#1080/34 helow. We have now received Colonel Reilly^ detailed report on this subject and the full text of the treaty as signed. While certain alterations have, in the circumstances described in Colonel Reilly’s despatch, been made in the terms of tne treaty, none of them is of any material importance and all of them are covered either by explicit instructions previously sent from here or by the discretion given the Resident in the matter. The Government of India are a separate signatory of the treaty and the Colonial Office have now asked us (tlr. Blaxter's letter below) to ascertain whether they agree that ratification should be proceeded with. A similar enquiry is being iiiade direct by the Colonial Office of the various interested departments of H.L.G. &amp;. The conclusion of the treaty reflects the greatest credit on Colonel Reilly and on It. Champion who accompanied him as Political Officer, and we have every reason to be well content with tne terms secured in it. There is no reason for withholding ratification A draft telegram formally consulting the Government of India, to whom copies of tne treaty and of Colonel Reilly's despatch have been sent direct, is submitted. 3. The opportunity may be taken to comment briefly on Colonel Reilly’s extremely interesting report of the negotiations with the Imam. The text of the treaty is flagged. The report is preceded by |a table of contents. 4/4. It will be remembered that the rtesiaent haa been instructed that he should in the first place secure the signature of a treaty substantially in the ; terms of the treaty actually signed. Secondly, that the signature of the treaty, once agreement had been reached on its terms, should be postponed until the Imam had evacuated certain districts in the Aden Protectorate occupied by him and had restored the hostages which he held from certain of the tribes in special treaty relations with us. Thirdly, that the embargo which he had placed on trade with the Aden Protectorate should be raised. The Resident had further been warned that we could not accept the Imam’s somewhat vaguely defined claims to suzerainty over Aden or the Protectorate or over certain islands' at the foot of the Hed Sea, the title to which in fact lies between the signatories of tne Treaty of Lausanne, though certain of them, such as Kamaran, are under our administrative control, but had been given authority to take note, without conmitting himself, of any representations‘which the Mam might make on this point. Colonel Heilly, by the exercise of tact and by firm handling when the adoption of a.firm attitude was necessary, seems to have achieved in an eminent degree all our aesluerata, including an undertaking by the Imam in respect of the slave trade, which he had been instructed to raise with His Highness only at the last moment. 6 * Points of interest in the report are as follows;- Para.10/2119 5000 8/33 Resident* s/ Department. - 5 4 Minute Paper. Para^rapn 10 . The Imaa/s impression that Parliamentary approval is requisite in this country if treaties are to he hinding, ana the satisfactory explanation given him hy Colonel He illy. Paragraphs 1£-15 . The difficulties which arose over the commercial clause of the treaty. ParaKraon 16 . Language of the treaty. Colonel Reilly, in the circumstances described, agreed that the Arabic text should prevail in any case of doubt. Paragraph 17 . Abandonment of the Imam's request for a secret appendix on the subject of the Red Sea Islands. The text of the letter written by him to Colonel Reilly on this subject is flagged. Paragraphs 19-28 , deal with the difficult negotiations in connection with the e vacuation of the occupied territory, the restoration of the hostages, and the removal of tne trade embargo. Paragraphs 3b-36 . British representation at Sana. This is a point of some importance. It will be seen that the Imam, alleging that if representation was granted to us representation would also be demanded by the Italians, deprecated the proposal for a permanent British representative. Instead, his negotiator proposed to recommend the appointment of a special frontier Officer whose duty it would be to visit the border districts and ensure that cases of trouble were disposed of quickly and in amicable agreement with the British authorities. Colonel Reilly gives jforcible reasons against pressing the question of a vt. British representative, and the arrangement^ which has i in fact been agreed,-aftQ» will, so far as can be judged, adequately meet the case, particularly if theResident's recommendation for the appointment of a special officer at Aden, who could he despatched to the Protectorate frontier at any point at which there is a danger of local trouble, is accepted. Paragraph 37 . Discussions about the slave trade article in the treaty. As will be seen, the necessary guarantees were secured from the Imam in the form of notes. This meets our point. Paragraph 58 . Landing ground in Imamic territory. The Imam's Government did not welcome this proposal, again alleging that it would produce a similar demand from the Italians, and the Resident thought it preferable not to press it. Paragraph o9 . 'Italian influence at Sana is greatly exaggerated and British friendship is too new to carry much weight yet'. Paragraphs 41-46 . Contributory causes to signature of treaty. Note in particular the beneficial effect from our standpoint of the tension with Ibn Saud, and the Imam's appreciation of British air power,, which Colonel Reilly regards as the most Important influence of any.

Mr.Champion was detained at Aden by illness# but wasable fortunately to leave a week later&gt; travelling by air to Kamaran» and thence by road to iodeidah and i^an'a On landing at Hodeidah we were received by Seif al Islam * Abdullah, a aon of the Imam and Governor of Hodeidah, and we proceeded next day by cara to Ma'bar, travelling by the old Hodeidah-San*a route aa far aa ^bal and thence by the new motor road constructed by the Imam about a year ago. This road is a remarkable engineering achievement, and climbs the steep and imposing Yemen mountains to a height of 7700 fe4t at Has al Masna', from which point it descends into the central Yemen plateau and joins the Uan’a-Dhamar-Yerira road at Ma*bar. 4. We spent the night at Ma*bar, where we were hospitably entertained by the Amil, Qadhi Ahmed al Jiraf and we reached San f a the following day (18th December) at about noon. We were accompanied on the whole journey from Hodeidah to 3an'a by ladhi ’AH al 1 Amri , a brother of the Imam’s Prime rini star. 5. On our arrival at San'a we were conducted through streets lined by troops to our residence, a large Turkish house called 'Ganaia', where we were welcomed by the Prime Minister, Qadhi ’Abdullah al ’Amri and the Foreign Minister, Qadhi Muhammad Ha^dbeb Bey, a Turkish gentleman whom I had first met at Aden about thirteen years previously in circumstances mentioned in paragraph 6 of my despatch to you, Mo.208 dated the 21st October 1931. 6. Next day, accompanied by Lieutenant Hamilton, I paid a formal call on the Imam, who gave us a very cordial reception. I presented my credentials, which the Imam rose to receive standing as a sign of respect to His Majesty the King, whose signature they bore.After some confers*tion the Imam stated that he intended to depute Qadhi I’uhammad Ra$ieb Bey to conduct the negotiations with me f at the ssme time declaring that he relied on me to look after his interests as well as those of ray own SofernmenU following day* As we were at the beginning of the month of Hamadhan f when San'a remains awake at night and sleeps in the mornings* it was arranged that our meetings should take place in the afternoons* They usually lasted about two hours. There were fifteen formal meetings, of which all wero with the Imam's Secretary for = , oreign Affairs, Qadhl Kuhararaad Ragheb oy* with the exception of one, to which I shall refer later, with the Prime Minister, Qadhi 'Abdullah al 'Amri.

I said that I hoped above all that my visit would have the effect of replacing the mutual suepicions w' ich had so long existed by mutual confidence, and that my arrival in anticipation of the removal of trade restrictions was an indication of the confidence that I, on my part, was prepared to place in the Imam'e promises. The Qadhi assured me that this confidence would be fully justified. fd:I fll,ATY Tiiaus 7. The negotiations were commenced on the At the first meeting I recapitulated briefly the circumstances in which I had been entrusted with myjustified. 9. It was reed that the treaty should be dealt with Article by Article. The Preamble and Articles lit IV t and VI presented no difficulty as their wording was already agreed. Our discussion therefore commenced with Article I. 10. The point at issue in this Article was the law's wish to insert the words 'and his GoTemment” after both 'ilia Majesty the King of Great Britain &amp;c H and 'His Majesty the King of the Yemen'* which His Majesty's Uoverment were unwilling to accept for the reasons stated in the Memorand uk sent to me with your Secret despatch of the 20th November, 1933. I found that the Iraair/s strong desire for the addition of these words was^mainly on his impression that no treaty made by Great Britain is really binding unless it is aoproved by Parliament, and on a con fusion in his mind between His Majesty’s Ministers and the Parliament to which Ministers are responsible. Although his views were not expressed precisely in these words it was evident that he felt that, to make himself secure, he must insist on the treaty being binding on the Parliamentary Government of Great Britain as well as on its &amp;oversfc;n f and the Qadhi instanced cases in which he believed that Parliament had reversed or altered British foreign policy. I explained that under the British Constitution the treaty making power is vested solely in the Crown; that it is open to Parliament to censure Ministers for giving bad advice to the Crown, but that Parliament cannot repudiate a treaty which the Crown has concluded. 1 also explained that the suggestion of a distinction In this respect between the King and his Government might produce difficulties with other States with which GreatBritain had concluded tre^tiaa in th# n*me of the King alone. The ladhi etentually accepted my arguments, but it becar^i© clear that the Imam’i doubts had still not been completely set at rest, nn f \ I therefore offered to send him, after the signature of the treaty, the Note which your Memorandum authorised me to address to him on this subject. This satisfied the Imam with regard to British constitutional practice, but not wita regard to his own. As an elected and not an ct* cii tv ty ruler h? felt thet the treaty must clearly corer hia State as well as himself, and he desired an addition to the Note to make this clear, still pressing for a reference to his ^overnmont* This T iaclinod, and the Qadhi then asked whether I could accent an addition of the words 'and his Kingdom' after 'His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam', which he said would content the Imam. This proposal did not appear to me to be open to the same objections as his original one, and the addition of these words did not, in my opinion, make any material di ference to the maaning of the Article. I therefore decided to agree to their insertion. 11. In Article III the Imam wished to omit the words 'of thet erritories of Hia fcsjeaty the King of the Yemen' after 'southern frontier'. I pointed out that 'southern frontier' alone wea too vague an expression, and the 'adhi admitted that it was so. He agreed to add the words 'of the Yemen', but said that the objected to the fuller phrase desired by His Majesty’s Government for reasons similar to those which he had adduced regarding his own position in connection with Article I. He said that His Majesty's Government’s wording suggested his personal possession of the country and was inappropriate to an elected and not hereditary6 . rular and therefore mi$it be prejudicial to bin. n* argument ana not very convincing, but the worda •aouthem frontier of the Yemen* had alwaya appeared to me to be adequate, provided that it was clear from the context that the term ’Yemen'* w»a used in its politic! and not in its wider geographical sense. I had expreaaed this view in paragraph 2(a/ of my daapetoh No.208 dated the 21at October 19S1, and the three referencea to the frontier in the second part o r Article III strengthened my opinion that it wea ol vi usi that a political and not a geographical boundary waa intended. In view however of the precise instructions contained in your Memorandum, I felt it neceaaary to ask by telegram for your approval. On receiving it I accepted the worda 'of the Yemen'. I waa already authorised to agree to the second alteration desired by the Imam in Article III - namely, the omission of the worda 'by persona under their protection', and with these amendments the Article was accepted by both aides. 12. Article V proved, rather surprisingly, to be the moat contentious in the treaty. I waa satisfied that the omission of the words -from the date of the coming into force of the present treatyhai no objectionable significance, and I therefore agreed to it in accordance with the instructions in your 1 ercorandum, and also to the phrase 'each of the High 'ontraotinp: Parties' instead of •one High Contracting Party'. With regard to the Imam’s insertion of and judgments' after 'local laws', I found that he really meant not judgments, but judicial and administrative orders and regulations in general. fhe word 'decrees' appeared to be a comprehensive definition of what was intended# and it was agreed that it should be substituted for'judgmenta't it being obvious that the subjects of either prrty musty when resident in the country of the othert submit to local administrative orders and regulations as well as to local laws and juicisl orders. 13. Considerable discussion followed regarding the question of national, as distinct from moet favoured nation treatment. The question was complicated by the fact that Article V (1) refers only to subjects of each of the parties who wish to txalfl in the territories of the other. Koat favoured nation treatment ie appropriati in matters of trade, but the Qadhi urged that national treatment would not be so* inasmuch as no foreigner in I the Yemen is at present allowed freedom in tradeequal to that given to natives of the country. It is» for instance f well known that foreir^iers are not permitted to acquire immoveable property f and the Yemen must make a good deal more progress before this restriction is likely to be removed. I said that I desired national treatment for British subjects as regards their position before the law, and not necessarily as regards trade. The Qadhi argued that this was already secured by the stipulation that they would be amenable to the local laws, which, he said, obviously implied that they would enjoy the protection of these laws, and would have the same legal rights as well as tho same legal obligations as the local people. Attempts were made to recast the clause in order to make this point clearer, and also to distinguish between traders and residents or visitors; but I eventually came to the conclusion that it would be better to let the clause stand as it was. There appears to me to be force in the contention that legal equality is clearly implied, and I consider that the clause as accepted^satisfactory.14. Clauses (2) and (3) of Article V gave a large amount of trouble. I discovered that this was due to the fact that undertakings similar to those in clause (2) have been included in treaties which the Imam has contracted or is negotiating with other European J o^ers; and as the clause gives moat favoured nation treatment* he is extremely averse to admitting in one treaty any words or explanations that do not appear in the others* fearing that to do so may exoose him to demands for modifications by the other countries concerned. It is for this reason that he disliked the addition of definitions in clause (3) and especially the definition of •vessels' which appeared to widen the meaning of vessels in clause (2), the context of which clearly in his opinion confined it to merchant vessels. lie objected to the reference to passengers in clause (2) for the same reason* and also because he feared that undesirable non-British foreigners mi^t obtain advantages from it by coming to the Yemen in British ships. 15. I said that I could not agree to the omission either of clause (3)* or of the reference to passengers in clause (2), and I explained His Majesty’s Government’s point of view with regard to the latter. I also insisted on the phrase 'in the ports of the territories of the other'* instead of the words 'in the ports of the other - desired by the Imam in clause (2). The Qadhi* after further references to the Imam* gave way on these points* and clauses (2) and (3) were accepted. To meet the Qadhi*a wishes I agreed to some alterations in their phrasing. The alight change in the wording of clause (2) makes no difference in its sense. In clause 13) (b) 'persons under His Majesty's protection' has been changed to 'the inhabitants of countries underHis laajeity 1 * protect ion' because the Iraarc apprehended that under the former phrase His Majesty's ’ovemment , mi^t take nertiouler individuals in the Yemen under their protection, a proceeding which I assured the Oadhi was certainly n6t intended on our part. In this clause the reference to companies also orave rise to much discussion, the Imam being very auspicious of the operations of foreign comuaniea in hia territory; but I insisted on its inclusion. The Qadhi on this occaaion, *s on some others, gave way on the point at Issue, but asked for a slight change in the phraseology which did not alter the senae, and which I accepted. Clause (3) (c) contained the vexed question of the meaning of 'vessels* in clause (2). On this point I was personally in agreement with the sdhi that it appeared from the context of clause ( 2 ; — that is, from the mention of cargoes and passenrers —tnat the vessels referred to were merchant ships. ho argued that this was so clear that it had been unnecessary to stress the point In the I'sem's t^eet^a with othor Furopes.n Powers, but that the proooaed definition in clause (3) (c) introduced an ambiguity which was absent from the other treatiea in which no definitions were included. After a telegranhic reference to you I yielded tiiia point, on which I myself was inclined to agree with the 'adhi's view, and the word “merchant* has been inserted before 'weasels”. 16. Article VII raised th. question of lanmiagw. Neither the Imam himself nor any of his Ministers or officials has any knowledge of English, and from the outset I hate felt certain that the Imam would newer consent (except possibly under force) to bind himself by a Treaty drawn up in a foreign language incomprehen sible to himself end to his adwisers. Pis cautiousand very auapicioua nature ma.koa it imoosaible for him to do so« and he is not in the least influenced by the argument that other ^rab rulers have taken tf is risk# tly proposal that the English and Arabic texts should have actual force was met by the objection that both could not be decisive if it ever appeared that there wa j • difference in their meanings* Under the authority of paragraph 12 of your Secret despatch of the 14th April 1932 and of your telegram of the 14th December» 1933 1 I eventually made the concession which I had throughout regarded as inevitable 9 and agreed that the Arabic text should prevail in case of doubt. 17. No reference wos mede on either side to the 'Secret Appendix^ which the Imam had suggested in his letter dated the 20th June 1933 f and which he had already been told in writing was wholly unacceptable to His Majesty’s Oovernraent. I do not think that he ever seriously supposed that this remarkable proposal had any chance of success* He has reconciled himself to the omission of any reference in the treaty to his claim to islands in the Red Sea, but Cadhi Muhammad Ha^jheb Bey raised the question of this claim in conversation. I followed the instructions on this subject contained in paragraph 5 of your despatch dated the 20th November 1933 t and refused to discuss the merits of the oaae 9 but said that I should be willing t after the signature of the treaty f to receive tb and ^report to His Majesty s Government any observations that the Imam might wish to make; but that I could give no indication of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in this matter. This procedure was accepted 9 and at my farewell visit to the Iraam after the treaty had been signed he gave me a brief statement of his claim to the islands in a formal note 911 . the receipt of which I acknowledged in writing but without comnrent. 18, These diacuaaiona with Qadhi yuhwnmed Rngheb Bey dispoeed of the tema of the treaty* all or which were finally agreed at our eleventh meeting on the 8th January, The Sngliih and Arabic taxta were compared with groat care by ilr. Champion and Khulusi ftffendi Khairi in consultation with Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey end myself* and I am confident that all possibility of er^or hps been eliminated, 19, ^e had now reached the crucial stage of the negotiations * namely the Imam's complirnce with the “pdroonitory document*. Qadhi t!uhanmad Raf^heb Bey ha i assured me that there would be no difficulty about this, but there nevertheless was some delay caused by a controversy regarding tho Bubeihi and Beihanborders, Mr. Champion had on tho 4th January given the Qadhi detailed lists showing the names of the villages and sub-sections in the 'Audhali country and the villages in the 3ffnah area# the evacuation of which was required. He also *ave him tho names of the Beihani and 9 Attdhali prisoners and hostages who were to be released* and a map showing approximately the line which must be established as the status quo before the signature of the t reaty, 20, The 4adhi raised no difficulties about the ’Audhali and Sanah evacuations, the release of prisoners and hostages and the removal of trade restrictions. But on the 9th January he said that the Imam's advisers had represented thst the effect of the British Ultimatum of October 1933 had been to advance the Protectorate line in the western Bubeihi area to include a number of(g&gt;&lt;5&gt; 12 . districts which hod never previously been in the British sohere. I was able to show the Qadhi on a map that these districts were on tho British aide of tho old An^lo-Turkish boundary, I admitted that tharo had been several Yemeni tax-oollecting incursions into them, but I said that the Aden Residency had protested whenever these ha 1 come to its knowledge, and that it had never admitted the right of the Yemenis to come south of the old Anglo-Turkiah frontier in this area* The British demand made in October 1933 was therefore not a new claim, but one from which His Majesty’s Oovenwent had never at any time receded. The '^dhi replied that the Imam accepted the line of the Anglo-Turkish boundary on this part of the frontier, and he professed to be convinced by the evidence of the map which I had shown him* 21* The Qadhi then raised a question regarding the Yemeni-Beihan frontier. He argued that the Mas’abis have no connection with ^eihan and no treaty with His Majesty’s Government, and that it is therefore wrong to include them in the Aden Protectorate* He maintained that the Mas’abis are on bad terms with the 3herif of Beihan and are naturally attached to the Qaifa tribe in the district of Rada’ in the Yemen, and that the Imam’s troops were wrongly excluded from their territory by British threats of air action in 1931. I replied that His Majesty’s Government’s treaty with the Sharif of Beihan accords protection to him and to his dependants, and that this expression has always been regarded as including the Mss’abis, moat of whose villages are situated in the Beihan valley in such close proximity to the Sherif’a villages that a division of control is impracticable. I denied that tho Mas’abi Sheikh or the rajority of his tribe are hostile to the13. Sherif (though I admitted thpt one of the minor Chiefs was ooposed to him), and I insisted that in any case I was unable to reopen the question of the frontier in this area, and that the position established in 1931 must be maintained without ohange. I refused to accept a further suggestion that the Sas'abi country should be treeted as neutral territory. 22. 1 hoped that my explanations had disposed of the Subeihi and Was'abi questions, but at an interriew two days later the Qadhi informed me that the Imam was still dissatisfied regarding them, that hie advisers had convinced him that His Majesty’a Government we-e | making new and unjustifiable olaime in the Cubeihi country, and that he still pressed his views regarding the Mas’abi tribe. The Qadhi suggested that Mr. Champion and a representative of the Imam should go immediately to study the Cubeihi boundary on the spot. I rejected this proposal, and said that I had given my definite assurance that His Majesty’s Goverment were claiming nothing more than the old Anglo-'furki i line in the Subeihi country and that I expected my word to be believed. I also refused to discuss any modification of the Beihan boundary. I told the Cadhi that if the Imam persisted in raising these new issues all our work on the treaty would be frustrated; and I warned him that if my present mission failed, the negotiations would be at an end, and His Majesty’s Government would have to turn to other means of settling outstanding questions. I said that every effort ought to be made to prevent such an alternative, and that His Majesty’s aovemmmt were most sinoarely desirous of a friendly agreement, but that the time had come for the Imam to decide whether he would honour hia promiaa to fulfil the conditions of the admonitory document. I begged the Qadhi to convince the Imam of the seriousness of the situation p-nir»*ne« fh. gj tha ■*'14. in the ©tent of further d elay • and aakad him to arrange an interview between the Imaffi and rayaelf if he *ere unable to do so. The Qadhi asked me to leave the matter to him. and I agreed to await the result of his efforts. 25. hiring this period the Imam was holding nightly conferences with his civil and military advisers and I believe that information» nd maps supplied to him by the Officer Commanding at Ta’ix at last convinced him that the British claim in the western Jubeihi area was justified. He. however, made a final effort to obtain, or at least to neutralise, the Maa’abi country. With this object he sent his Prime Minister. Cadhi ’Abdullah al ’Amri. to see me on the 13th January. This new envoy, an Arab belonging to a distinguished Pan’a family and a man of very agreeable presence and manners, asked me for a reconsideration of the Mas'abi question or for a reference to London on tho subject, and he also suggested that the British demand for the evacuation of Sanah might be drooped. He appeared to me to realise from the outset that he had little or no prospect of succeeding in these requests, but (in accordance, no doubt, with his instructions), he pressed them on me fbr over an hour. I declined politely but steadily to entertain them in any form, and Qadhi ’Abdullah eventually accepted my refusal, and said that the conduct of the negotiations would no'* be resumed by «adhi Muhammad Rapheb Bey. 24. The latter accordingly came to see me on the 15th January, and informed me that the Imam had decided to comply with the terms of the admonitory document without further delay, and was issuing immediate orders for the evacuation of the ’Audhali country and the -anah area, for the release of the prisoners and hostages.and for the removal of hi a embargo on overland tr»c:e with the Aden Protectorate. The territories to be surrendered were defined oreciaely by two liatar-one of 64 villages in the Audhali country and the other o r 8 villages in the 3anah area — which had been carefully prepared beforehand by 54r. Champion. The list of Audhali villages was necessarily baaed on evidence supplied by the Audhali Sultan, and it was therefore possible that it might err in favour of the Audhalis. I nevertheless decided to insist on it in its entirety, with the reservation that it might subsequently be corrected after closer enquiry on the spot which was impossible as long as the Heidis remained in occupation. On the other hand the Audhali Sultan had been warned that no villages would b© claimed other than those named in the list, and in my demands to the Imam I adhered to the principle of the whole list and nothing but the list The Qadhi stated that the evacuations and other measures would commence on the 18th January. 25. The embargo on overland trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate was removed punctually on that date, and the Jan&amp;h district was evacuated immediately. The Imam’s orders for the release of prisoners and hostages and for the evacuation of the •Audhali country were not obeyed with equal promptitude, and four weeks elapsed before the treaty could be signed 26. This unfortunate delay was due mainly to the obstructive attitude of the Imam's ’Amil at Beidha whose duty it was to arrange the Yemeni withdrawal from the 'Audhali country, and to a controversy about certain villages named in the list of places to be liberated. The * Arnil of Beidha maintained that a number of these, and particularly those in the Shurjan and Am Haj«&gt;riya districts, did not belong to the 'Audhali tribe, and hiscontention was aupportod at i&gt;an’a by beyyid ’Abdullah al aair # a former Governor of the Jhnraar province which included Beidha and the Upper ’Audhali country* 27. dayyid ’Abdullah had come to Gan 1 a to take charge of the Imam’s mission to negotiate with Lia’udi representatives at Abha, and on January 26th Qadhi ’Abdullah al ’Atari brought him to call on me. He told me that he knew the country in question intimately and that there waa no doubt that the Ghurjan and Am Hajariya districts were not ’Audhali* and he argued that Qadhi Muheiamad Kagheb Bey had agreed to their evacuation through ignorance of the locality. I declined at this stage of the negotiations to modify my demands for evacuationt which the Imam had already accepted; but I informed Qadhi ’Abdullah al ’Amri that I should be willing, on my return to Aden, to send an officer to the country in dispute to make a local investigation in collaboration with a Yemeni representative; and that, if it wore found that any of the places evacuated were beyond the limits of the ’Audhali tribe, they would be restored. The Imam, to whom this conversation was reported, sent me an assurance that he intended to abide by his promises to withdraw from all the places named in the list which had been given to him, and said that he was willing to leave the question of the restoration of Shurjan and Am Hajariya to the result of my enquiries in which he did not wish to participate. 28. The Mission was throughout in wireless oommunication with the Acting Resident at Aden, by whom I was informed of the progress of the Zeidi evacuation. Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey was kept in touch with the course of ©vents by a daily interchange of visits, usually paid by Mr. Champion on him. Captain B. Seager was sent from 'den to the ’Audhali country onJanuary 17th to suporintend the re-occupation of the surrendered territory by the ’Audhaliat and to ensure tha it was effected without friction or conflict with the retiring Yemenis. The first villages on the high plateau which constitutes the upper ’Audhali country were handed over by the ’Awil of Reidha to Captain Seager on January 27th, and the evacuation of all the villages named in the list referred to in paragraph 24 was completed by February 8th* All the ’Audhali hostages had also been released and handed over to Captain Seager by this date. Some doubt continued as to whether the Beihan prisoners had also actually been released. They had been confined at Dhamar, from which place the direct road to their homes did not pass through Captain Ceager’c neighbourhood, and it was not until February 10th that I could satisfy myself of their liberation. I¥. .CONCLUSION QF T.H,: TREATY . 29. All the conditions of the admonitory document having now been fulfilled I signed the treaty with Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey on the morning of February 11th, and ,j at the same time I handed to him the Note referred to in paragraph 10 of my report. BO. I and the other members of the Mission paid our farewell visit to the Imam on the same day. He received us with great cordiality, and both he and his Ministers were obviously greatly pleased by the happy issue of the negotiations. I read a short speech to His Majesty, a copy of which is attached to my report, and he gave me a telegram and &amp; letter, both addressed to His Majesty the King. I despatched the former immediately, and I am forwarding the latter to you under cover of a separate despatch. 31. The Mission left 3an*a on the afternoon ofIB. @&gt;S) February 12th. A ceremony similar to that on our arrival was obaorvedt and the Prime Minister# the Foreign Minister and other leading State officials came to our houae to bid ub farewell ana to see us off* After a halt for a night st Ma'bar we reached Hodeidah on the evening of February 13th. t'e embarkea on H.M.S. Penzance on the following morning, and I there recoived a telegram from his Majesty the King to the Imam, a translation of which was immediately telegraphed to San*a. 32. After calls at Kamaran and Perim we arrived at Aden on the morning of February 17th. I landed officially, and was greatly impressed by the enthusiasti welcome accorded to the Mission by the people of den, who are delighted by the removal of the restrictions on their overland trade and by the conclusion of a treaty of friendship with the Yemen. V. SUBS ID I &gt;\HY QUhhTIQM. 33 # A number of subsidiary questions came under discussion or consideration during the negotiations. Of these the principal were the future of Hubei'atein, the interchange of British and Yemeni representatives, the Slave Trade, landing grounds in Yemeni territory, and Sa’udi-Ye;jeni relations. 34. The question of Hubei’atein was discussed in my despatch No.253 dated 16th December 1931, and in your telegraphic reply dated the 16th January 1932 yos agreed that it should not be regarded as vital. I accordingly raised it but did not press it. In dealing with the boundary in his interview with Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey on the 4th January (to which I have referred in paragraph 19), Mr. Chamnlon made it clear that is Majesty*s Government reserve their right to claimRubei’utein if they wish to do so when the frontier is finally agreed in accordance with the third *rticle of the treaty. It was, however, obvious that an immediate demand for this district, which h^s now been in Yemeni occupation for many years, could not be enforced without endangering the success of the negotiations. Hubei’atein has undoubtedly for long been a dependency of the Upper Yafa’i Sultans, but its people are not lafa'is* and their destiny is therefore not a matter of interest to the Upper Yafa*! tribee rb a whole, but only to one of their Chiefs, the titular Sultan, who desires the revenue which his predecessors drew from this district in former days* Lest year the Sultan’s father made a rash and unsuccessful raid into the country in direct disobedience of the instructions of the Aden Residency, and this unauthorised and embarrassing action made me the leas inclined to risk the success of my mission in the immediate proaecution of his claim. The Sultan’s notorious inability to exercise effective control ovor his own tribe, or evon over his own section of it, added to my reluctance to insist on the restoration of an extra-tribal dependency to his rule. In these c rcumstancea I decided to conte rjyaelf with Mr. Champion’s reservation on this subject. Although the question o^ Beidha was not stressed in the same manner as that of Rubei’atein, I made it clear on more than one occasion that ills Llajeaty’s Government are not precluded by the t erms of the present troaty from claiming it and all territory up to the old Anglo-Turkid line, in the course of the final settlement. 35. In your Secret despatch dated the 14th April 1932 I was indtructod to urge the appointment of a permanent British representative at 3an’a after the conclusion of the treaty. The Imam raised objectionsto this proposal in » latter dated the 20th June 1953, • translation of which was sent to you in the *eting Resident’s despatch No.164 dated the 12th July 1933. As the point was not further pressed, either to the Actiflg Resident or in your latest instructions to rre, T concluded that His Mejesty's Government do not attach any urgent importance to it. In my opinion, after further consideration, there are certain disadvantages which appear to me to outwei$i the advantage* of the proposal. These aro:- (1) a permanent representative at San'a would not have work enough to occupy his time. (2) the appointment of a British repreaentntive would almost certainly he followed by a demend &lt;-or the appointment of an Italian representative, and possibly by similar demands from other Governments. These foreign representatives would have little to do except to watch each other’s supposed activities and to compete for influence with the Imam. (3) the Imam, hating been recognised aa a King, would in all likelihood expect the representative to I have the same status aa the British repreacntetive — accredited to his neighbour and rival, King Ibn Sa ud, that is, the rank of a Minister, which I anticipate His Majesty's Government would not be prepared to necord to him. The Italian Government, on the other hand, ai$it have no such objection, if they felt that the establishment of a Lagntion in the v amen would strengths! their position in Arabia. (4) the appointment of a iritish representative at San'a might be balanced by that of a Yemeni representative at Aden. My experience of the presence of an envoy from the Imam at Aden from 1921 to 1924 does not encourage me to welcome this prospect. He ti ned an influence and authority over the co nsid erableZeidi element in the population of Aden which was most undesirable* and his intrigues with Protectorate Chiefs led to his dismissal. 36 # My speculations in this respect may be mistaken* but the contingencies that I have mentioned appear to me to be both possible and likely to be embarrassing. I was therefore neither surprised nor seriously disappointed when Cladhi Muhammad Hagheb Bey deprecated my proposal that a permanent British representative should be sent to San*a after the conclusion of the treaty. ne based the Iman/s objections mainly on the certainty that the Italian Government would immediately make a similar remand with which he would be most reluctant to comply* but which he would be unable to refuse. He suggested as an alternativ# that a British official represents! Its should go to .ian'a from time to time as occasion demanded, and this solution appears to me to be both sensible and sufficient for the present. C:adhi Muhammad Hagheb Bey realised that disputes and friction are bound to occur from time to time between local tribes on the frontier, and that undesirable incidents may result of th*se are not adjusted promptly by the two controlling Governments acting* if possible* in co-operation. For this purpose he proposed to l recommend to the Imam the anoointrnent of a sp^cifll Frontier Officer whose duty it would be to visit the border districts and to ensure that causes of trouble were disposed of quickly and in amicable agreement with the British authorities. He asked me for my opinion of this plan, and I told him that it appeared to me to be an admirable one. I added that I should lika to be able to employ an officer in a corresponding manner on our side of the frontier* and that I should submit thissug^eBtion to my Government, I have stated ray reason® against the appointment of a permanent representative at oan'a. In my opinion it would be preferable to hr,ve an officer posted at Aden under the control of the Resident who would be available for despatch to the Protectorate frontier at any point at which there was a darker of local trouble which might endanger the harmony at any time that personal discussion with the Yemeni Government appeared to be desirable. This officer should be in addition to the two Political Officers appointed at Aden for work in the Aden Protectorate! - whose duties {which I outlined in my despatch No,266 dated 9th November 1933) would not leave them time for visits to the Yemen, I intend to address you on this subject in a separate despatch* in which I shall submit my proposal in more detail, 37, On the 4th January I received telegraphic instructions from you to endeavour to obtain the insertion in the treaty of the Slave Trade clause contained in the treaty which Sir Gilbert Clayton endeavoured to negotiate with the Imam in 1926, or alternatively an interchange of Notes to the same effect. By this time the terms of the treaty ’were practically agreed* and I was reluctant to bring forward new demands at so late a stage. I therefore broached this request without pressing it very strongly, which seemed to me at this point to be the best way of securing the Imam 1 a willing acceptance, Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey denied that the Imam had definitely agreed to the clause in the Clayton draft: he said that it had at that time been reserved for further consideration when the main terms of the treaty had been agreed, and that the Imam would now prefer to give the assurance desired by His Majesty's of Anglo-Yemoni relations, and who could be sent to Jan'aGrovamment in the form of an exchange of otes. I consented to this proposal* and translations of my Note to the loarn and of hia reply are attached to my report. 38* The Officer Commanding the British Forces at Aden had* before my departure, suggested the desirability of asking the Imam to allow a landing ground for aeroolenes to be made in his territory# preferably near Gan 9 a* I thought that the Imam would be more likely to agree to one at or near Hodeidah# and I made this suggestion. It was met by the usual plea that permission to the British to make &amp; landing ground would necessitate a similar concession to the Italians* ■ who were very anxious to secure one near L^eidi or Sal if (opposite Kamaran)« Qadhi Muhammad Ragheb Bey said that the Imam was strongly opposed to granting the Italian Government this permission* and he therefore begged me not to press this proposal at present. I iid not pursue it further* judging it better to leave it for future discussion if His Majesty’a Government wish to press it. 39. The tension between the Yemen and Sn’udi Arabia continued throughout the time that the Mission was at San’a, and under your instructions I took several opportunities of expressing the hope that direct hostilities would be avoided. I was assured that the Imam was most anxious to find a peaceful solution* and soon after dwnadhan a Yemeni mission under Ceyyid ’Abdullah *1 atir was despatched to Abha to negotiate a settlement. In my opinion the Imam intended tfarou-^hout to avoid war* but he was very suspicious of Ibn Sa’ud’s intentions* and wished by a strong show of force* and by delay* to secure the beat possible terms for himself. Defeats in Nejran at the hands of the Beni Yam prompted him to negotiate* and his knowledge0) S) 24. of the attitude of the British end Italian Governments may have inclined him in the same direction. But Italian influence at San’a is greatly exaggerated, and British friendship is too new to carry much weight yet. The Iman; is in any case too auspicious of all foreigners to trust much in their advice or to submit hi a general policy to their guidance. 40. I had anticipated that the Imam might raise the question of the importation of munitions into the Yemen from the United Kingdom, hut he did not do so in any form, and I did not allude to it. ii*. 41. It is of interest to note certain factors which have helped to make the work of my mission considerably easier than, for instance, that of Sir Gilbert Clayton in 1926, 42. In the first place the treaty which it has been my task to negotiate is much shorter than the draft with which Sir Gilbert had to deal. Several clauses have been dropped which were contentious, cumbersome, or of minor importance* *nd the number of articles has been reduced from sixteen to seven. Credit for this useful abridgement of the former rather unwieldy document is due to dir Keith 3tewart, 4r Stewart Symes, and to the Imam himself, 43. Secondly, agreement has been facilitated by the adoption of Sir Gilbert Clayton's proposed dilatory clause regarding the frontier, whereby its present position has been stabilised for the period of the treaty, an I its final settlement has been postponed for future decision. 44. A third contribution to the solution of the problem has been the device of the 'admonitory document25. which hag gecurgd the evacuation of territory, the releew of prisoners and hostages, and the removal of trade reatrictiona without hurting the Imam’s feelings by including these points in the text of the treaty. By this means the Imam’s dislike of making any surrender on paper has been circumvented, and His Majesty's Oovemment have obtained peacefully essential objects of their policy, and have at length honoured in full their obligations to the ’Audheli tribe and the /hair of -hala 1 . 45. Fourthly, the Imam’s very real desire to end his long standing quarrel with the British LJovemment has been strengthened by the increasing tension of his relations with Ibn Ja’ud. He naturally did not wish to be caught between two fires, and the growing danger of war with his powerful northern neighbour made him more ready to adjust his differences with the British in the south. This motive is especially strong now that he and his Ministers are growing concerned about securing a peaceful succession to the Imaraate. Some years ago the Imam secured the election of his eldest son Ahmed as his heir, but this innovation which aims at substituting hereditary succession for a purely elective rulership has still to stand the test of events when the Imam dies, and the Imam is the more anxious to bequeath a stable State recognised by leading Powers and in friendly relations with its neighbours. 46. A fifth cause which has influenced the Imam’s policy — and probably the strongest of all — has been his appreciation of British air power. His troops were expelled by air action from the lower ’Audhal1 country in 1925 and from the Anirate of Dhala* in 1928. The latter operation involved places within his own territory as well as districts which he had seised in the Aden - rotectora^e, and the deep impression which it made uponhim was proved by his immediate complipnce with the demands of the A1 ’Ain ultimatum in 1931 and of the ^ubeihi ultimatum in 1933. I was authorised to warn the Imam that a failure of my mission would probably result in a solution of the ’Audholi and ienab questions by force. I wishedf if possible# to avoid the use of this threat# and the whole of the treaty was negotiated without any need to hint at it. But after the treaty terras had been agreed the Imam’s delay in ordering the fulfilment of the conditions of the admonitory document led me las mentioned in paragraph 22 of ray report) to speak seriously to Qadhi Mohamad dagheb Bey of the dangers of a breakdown. Although it proved unnecessary for me to use language of this nature to the Imam himself there is no doubt that he realised the situation, and he was therefore anxious to accept the alternative which ray mission offered of a friendly settlement with His Majesty’s Government. 47. The Mission were greatly impressed by the evidences of the internal strength of the Government of the Yemen. The present Imam had already secured control of the ^eidi highlands while the country was still a Turkish province, but the withdrawal of the Turks at the end of the Great Var left the lowlands and some of the mountain districts in a state of chaos. Out of this confusion the Imam has built up a highly centralised State a|id has established law and order among the unruly tribes. It was interesting to observe the contrast between the complete security in which heavily laden caravans now journey unarmed through the country by day and night with the risks which were formerly run by travellers in the Yemen# and which unfortunately are still run in parts of the Aden27* Protectorate* 48 In conclusion I wish to emphasise the extent to which the success of the mission has been due to loyal co-operation in tfieir respective spheres of all its members. Mr. Champion's help was invaluable* He hf*d an intimate knowledge of the subject* and his mastery of Arabic (both spoken and written)* and also of French (in which language our conversations with 4 adhi Imhammad Ragheb Bey were largely conducted) was of supreme value* i relied throughout on his sound judgment afvi his good advice, and I desire to commend his services strongly to your notice* Lieutenant the Honourable R* A* B* Hamilton of the *den Protectorate Levies acted as Transport Officer and as my personal Aide-de-Camp. He was also in charge of the Aden Protectorate Levy signaller* who worksd ouV indispensable wireless sat. His efficiency and unrarying equanimity and cheerfulness through all the vicissitudes of the negotiations were . «r..t ....l, I ... l^r...ri „„ ftcqu.int.n 09 with him by his capacity and suitability for the political employment which he desires. for the i ission, fully justified his selection. He is a capable interpreter, and he adapted himself easily to his surroundings in a country the people and conditions of which are in many ways in striking contrast to the part of the Arab world to which he is accustomed. ills religion and his good manners and conduct made him an acceptable intermediary to the Imam and his Uinistars. Hr. C. J. Vyas, who acted as Medical Officer to t Mission, is an Indian Subordinate kedioal Sersioe whose senrices hare for some time been lent to HI Mif^ineas the lultan of Lahej in connection with khulusli Sffendi Khairi, whose services were borrowed from the Ooverrment of Palestine as interpreter28 . dispensary work which has brought him into close contact with Arabs of warioua classes. He is a Hindu, but was quite happy in the strictly Moslem atmosphere of ian’a. The health of the Mission was fortunately excellentt and in the absence of any serious demands by its members on his professional services, Mr. Vyas found scope for hia energy and ability in the treatment of over a thousand local patients. He was also called into consultation with Italian, :hitch and Egyptian confreres on the health of the Imam, who has for some years suffered from a complaint of the kidneys, and who was obviously pleased with Mr. Vyas's quiet self- possession and efficiency. Mr. Saleh Ja*far, an Arab gentleman who is employed by the Aden Residency in a political capacity at Hodeidah, accompanied the Mission, and hia knowledge of the country and personal acquaintance with the Imam's entourage, combined with hia tact and discretion, were of great assistance. It will be recalled from my previous reports that Mr.Saleh Ja'far visited San'a twice about &amp; year ago at the Imam's invitation and with my permission, and under my instructions he was then able to give to the Imam a verbal explanation of certain points — notably in connection with the Red Sea islands — which helped materially in clearing the way for the vi&amp;it of the Mission. The Officer and other ranks of the Aden Protectorate Levies who accompanied the Mission rendered valuable service, especially in maintaining regular wireless communication with Aden, but for which it would have been impossible to accomplish the work of the Mission without much greater delay. 50. I have referred in paragraph 28 to Captain B, ’. Seager's work in connection with the evacuation of the 'Audhali country and I wish to record my high29* opinion of tho manner in which he carried out a teak requiring careful jud/iaent* patience and tact under conditions of considerable physical strain and discomfort among people and in a country quite new to him* He was ably aasiated by Fli dit Lieutenant E* G* Lewi 3 9 Royal Air Force* who accompanied him on the plateau* 51* The Mi salon was greatly indebted throughout to t &gt;e cloao oo-operation of the authorities at Aden under the Acting Resident* Lieutenant-Colonel H* M. ^ightwiok and the Officer Commanding the Forces, Group Cap tain 0 • T * *3©y d * t) * B • *•&amp; *C* t'\.*F*o* 52* As I have stated* the Mission was conveyed from Aden to Hodeidah in H.II.S.

But the Treaty that has been signed to-day is the first that has been made between the two otates in recent times# and it marks a most important occasion in their relations with each other.

This is as follows:- From approximately HUSN MUHAD to the fADI BAHA it is identical with the old demarcated Anglo-Turkish boundary as shown on official roa )a of the Aden Protectorate. From the demarcated point on the WADI BANA, eastwards it follows tribal boundaries which have never been demarcated in detail on the ground, and which the inaccuracy of existing maps makes it impossible to define precisely on paper, but which are known to the tribes concerned. These are the northern and eastern boundary of the UPPISR YAFA* tribe* excluding HUBSI’ATSIH, the boundaries between the UPP&amp;R YAFA # * L0T3R YAFA* and FADHLI tribes and BSIDHA* the north-western and northern boundary of the ’AUDHALI tribe* the western boundary of the •AULAQI tribe, and the western and north-western boundary of BSIHAN* including the MAS’ABI country.

We are not yet in posseeoion of the final text of the treaty, in which some minor alterations from the final draft may have been made by the Resident at his discretion. After the treaty has besn ratified, it will* however, in due course be published. Generally, the provisions of tho treaty are as follows:- By the treaty His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the complete and absolute independence of His Majesty the King of the Yemen. The treaty provides for the maintenance of peace and friendship between the contracting parties. The settlement of the question of the boundary between the territories of the Imam and the Aden Froteo- torate is to be the subject of negotiations to be initiated before the expiry of the period of the present treaty, but pending the conclusion of those negotiations, the contracting parties agree to maintain the situation existing in regard to the frontier on the date of the signatureeignatur# of the treaty, and undertake to prevent any violation by their forces of this frontier. The treaty provides that the High Contracting Parties shall enter into such agreements as shall be necessary for the regula tion of comnkeroial and economic affairs, based on the principles of general international practice, and that the subjects of one party who wish to trade in the territories of the other shall be amenable to the local laws, and shall receive treatment not less favourable than that enjoyed by the subjects of the other party. Similar provisions are included as to the treatment of vessels end their cargo. The treaty is to come into force on the date of the exchange of ratifications and to remain in force for a period of 40 years. As a preliminary to the signing of the treaty, the Imam was required to remove the restrictions which he had imposed on overland trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate, and to restore and surrender all the territories and subjects of the Chiefs who are in treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. Before the signature of the treaty, the Resident had reported that all these requirements had been fulfilled. The conclusion of the treaty furnishes an amicable settlement of the difficulties that have existed for many years on the boundary of the Aden Protectorate, and great credit is due to Colonel Reilly for the tact and skill with which he has conducted the negotiations. In case lord lamington raises the point, but not otherwise, it might be added that it is understood that provision would be made by an exchange of notes after the signing of th&lt;s treaty for the co-operation of the Imam in the suppression of the slave trade in the Red Sea.RJR/DIA.
