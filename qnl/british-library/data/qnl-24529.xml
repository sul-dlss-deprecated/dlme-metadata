From—The Naval Commander-in-Chief, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. 'Will you kindly postpone till end of the War the consideration of any question of the transfer of coaling dep6ts from Busbire to Koweit. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram No. 570-M, dated Simla, the 22nd May 1916. From—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, To—His Excellency the Naval Commander in-Chief, Bombay. Will you kindly refer to Marine Department telegram No. 1671-7-M, dated the *10th February 1915. The Secretary of State for India haying approved the transfer of the coaling depot from Bushire to Koweit, the Govern ment of Bombay was asked to issue the necessary instructions for the construc tion of works at Koweit. With Marino Department letter No. 1671-14-M, dated the 31st March 1915, a copy of this order was sent to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. Will your Excellency kindly inform me of tl e reasons why you recommend the postponement of the transfer in order that the position may be explained to the Secretary of State for India. This is with reference to your Excellency’s telegram No. 36, dated the 13th May 1916. Enclosure No. 3. Telegram No. 42, dated 31st May 1916. From—The Naval Commander in-Chief, East Indies, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. But for strategical reasons, I have no objection to coal dep6ts being com menced at Koweit. During the war His Majesty’s ships must coal at Bushire and therefore it is undesirable at present to remove coaling station from Bushire. There are also no telegraph cable or wireless telegraph station at Koweit. This is with reference to your telegram No. 573-M , dated the 22nd May 1916. fo* *4- * Telegram No. 632-M, dated the 3rd June 1916. From—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, To—The Director, Royal Indian Marine. It has been represented by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief that it is not desirable to remove the coaling station to Koweit from Bu^hire. Until further orders no action is therefore to he taken to remove the depdt. This is with reference to the correspondence ending with Marino Department endorsement, dated the 27th September 1915, No. 885-M.2 Enclosure No. 5* No. C»W.-S33S, dated Bombay Castle, the 10th August 1916, Fioin Ali Akbar, Esq., M. Inst, C.E., Acting Joint Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Public Works Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. With reference to my telegram No. 6143-T of the 14th June 1916, I am directed to forward herewith, for sanction, two abstracts of revised estimates for constructing— (1) a coal shed, and (2) fencing at Koweit, together with a recapitulation and two compara tive statements. It will be seen that according to the revised recapitulation the total cost of w orks^ amounts to Hr. 1,00,071 as against the original sanctioned estimates amounting to Us. J^L,60l and with the addition of Rs. 1,501 on account of tools and plant chnrges\% amount of the revised estimate stands at Rs. 1,01,572. I am to observe that no provision for establishment has been made in the estimate as the Accountant-General reported that the establishment in the Persian Gulf being Imperial will carry out this work which is also Imperial and the net charges under this head remain at debit of the head “ Establishment *’ under “ Imperial *' and are not distributed over individual works. The provi sion for tools and plant is, however, necessary as all the tools in the Karachi Buildings District are Provincial and credit will have to be given to that head by per contra debit to Imperial. 2. The increased cost is due to the enormous rise in the price of cement and iron work, particularly the litter, and the high cost of carriage and labour due to the war conditions in the Persian Gulf. In consequence of this excessive rise in the cost of the work the Governor in Council suggests, for the consideration of the Government of India, that unless these works are of extreme urgency they might stand over for the present. If, however, the fencing is oonsfdered imperatively necessary it could be constructed this year. 3. I am to request that the orders of the Government of India may be communicated at an early date, as there is a provision of Rs. 35,000 in the current year’s budget of Imperial Civil Works.

Bingley, C.I.E., I.A., Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, To—The Joint Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Public Works Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. C.W.-8338, dated the 10th August 1916, forwarding abstract of revised estimates for the construction of {i) a coal shed, and (2) fencing at Koweit, in connection with the proposed transfer of the coaling dep6ts from Bushire to that place. 2. In reply I am to say that the Government of India have decided not to carry out these works until the conclusion of the war as the removal of the coaling station from Bushire to Koweit has, on the recommendation of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, been postponed. 3.

Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 573—M., dated the 12th July 1915, intimating that the expenditure on the construction of a coaling depot at Koweit should be borne entirely by Indian revenues and to say that instructions have accordingly been communicated to the Accountant General, Bombay. 2. With reference to paragraph 4 of the Government of India’s letter No. 1671—13-M., dated the 26th March 1915, I am to state that the works in connection with the new coaling station at Koweit have not been let to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the reasons mentioned by the Executive Engineer, Karachi Buildings District, in his letter No. C—6465 of 2nd July 1915, addressed to the Superintending Engineer, Indus Right Bank Division, a copy of which together with its accompaniment is appended for the informa tion of the Government of India. 3. In the current official year it is proposed to construct the Pier and Servants’ quarters at an aggregate cost of Rs. 16,380, and the requisite money has been sanctioned by reappropriation from the funds provided for B Class \\ orks as suggested in paragraph 5 of the Government of India’s letter of the 26th March last quoted in paragraph 2 above.

No. C.—6465, dated Kardchi, 2nd July 1915. From—A. F. Thorpe, Esq., Executive Engineer, Karachi Buildings District ; To—The Superintending Engineer, Indus Right Bank Division. With reference to correspondence ending with your No. C.—3299, dated 2nd June 1915, I have the honour to inform you that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company who were addressed under this office No. 4007, dated 1st May 1915, to tender for the pier at Koweit, though reminded several times, did not send their final reply till 12th June 1915, which reached this office on 21st June 1915. A copy of their letter is attached. The plans and estimates referred to by them did not reach this office till the 25th June last, and then the abstract and measurement sheet of the pier were missing. On being wired again they state that they would be able to tender in 3 weeks’ time and that they have posted the missing pages of the estimate. I rather doubt whether we shall receive the tender after 3 weeks and even if we do, their rates may not be favourable. 2. I, therefore, asked Haji Mahomed Hassan, Contractor, referred to in this office No. 4008 of 3rd May 1915 to your address, to tender for the work, and though he showed reluctance to go to such a long distance for the works, he has given tenders for the undermentioned works which I send herewith for favour of your acceptance at a very early date and return so that orders may be given to the contractor, who is shortly starting for the Persian Gulf, to make arrangements for starting the works : (a) Constructing a rubble stone pier at Koweit. {b) Constructing Servants’ quarters at Koweit. The estimates were prepared as far back as 1911 and the cost of labour and materials have since then risen. The rates tendered by the contractor are, I think fair and reasonable considering this fact. 3. This contractor as stated in my No. 4008 of 3rd May is already working as a contractor for Wireless Station at Henjam in the Persian Gulf and is a very reliable man and I strongly recommend him for the works at the rates tendered by him. I may state that I searched for some other contractor, but no one is willing to go there. pier as will be seen from the items put in the tender consists only of stone 1^ rT he i-U r JU ujjc ucuuci uuusisus ouiy 01 Slone worn, it is, therefore, not necessary to wait for Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s tender for the reasons given in paragraph 1 above. This contractor, viz., Haji Mahomed Hassan will be able to do it within the time stipulated for its construction. 5. The only works that will remain to be arranged for are as under: (a) Coal shed. (b) Fencing. These consist mostly of iron work and an indent on England for the same is in hand and will be submitted shortly. They can be put in hand only when the iron work arrives. J 6. As the pier is to be completed before the arrival of the iron work, early orders to commence the work as per tender submitted may please be given. 7. An application for local purchase of iron work for submitted shortly. servants’ quarters will be 7(&lt;z). The amounts that will be required for expenditure paragraph 2 above during 1915-16 will be as under on works referred to in (а) Pier (б) Servants’ quarters Rs. 7,890 8,490 16,380 8. As the works referred to in paragraph 5 above cannot be started before arrival oi tue iron work, I do not think any amount can be usefully spent on them this year.If, however, the iron work arrives before the expiry of the current official vear thp amount upto the indent on England can be spent. This will be determined when the indent is prepared and reported. wuea me 9. The rent statements will be submitted shortly. P.-S.—The amount of each tender will be within the amount of the estimate for each work including contingencies. sanctioned (2) Security deposit at 5 per cent, has been entered in the tenders as a special case as a facility for the contractor and may please be passed.

Sir, I have the honour respectfully to invite attention to the question of the transfer of the Bushire Coal Depot to Koweit, the correspondence regarding which on my record ends with Poreign Department endorsement 1T0.1456-E.A., dated 4th July 1912. A-*-* 2. My understanding of the qurt * .vn is as follows The transfer was proposed by me in 1907 mainly on grounds of comparative coaling facility and convenience, but also with the idea of consolidating incidentally, our footing at Bandar Shwaikh. The question progressed very deliberately until 1910- 1911 when the aggressive attitude of the local Turkish authori- ties in regard to various points at issue with us in the Gulf indicated the advisability of the early accomplishment of the project as one means of strengthening our de_ facto position J at Koweit. In January 1911 however, specific negotiations commenced with the Porte with a view to a co?nprehensive adjustment of conflictingconflicting interests and it was considered by His Majesty*s Foreign Office in April 1512 that if we were to commence extensive building operations during the progress of the negotiations, the Porte might have grounds to object to our proceedings, as constituting a modification of the status guo . It was therefore postponed for the time being, and pending the conclusion of current discussions with the Porte which seemed in a fair way of reaching definite result. The said negotiations were however broken off owing to the outbreak of war between Turkey and other Powers and are now in a state of indefinite suspension* Once they have recovered from their present embarrassments, the Turks are hardly likely to be more conciliatory in regard to Gulf matters than they were before but for the present they are presumably too much occupied to take any interests in the affairs of Koweit; I venture therefore to enquire whether it would not be prudent to proceed with the construction of the coaling depot without further delay. 3* I would add that our omission to make good our deCclared intentions in regard to measures for which we have formally and specifically asked his concurrence, such as this project and the case of the Post office, is calculated to have a prejudicial effect on the Sheikh of Koweit»s mind.

(Immediate and Confidential.) Foreign Office, 16th August 1911. A request has been made by the Turkish Ambassador, under instructions from his Government, that he may be furnished with copies of the agreements with the Trucial Chiefs, and the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, to which reference is made in the memorandum communicated to His Excellency on the 29th ultimo. As the agreements with the Trucial Chiefs and the Sheikh of Bahrein have already been published, Sir Edward Grey assumes that there would be no objection to communicating them to the Ottoman Government, and, if this is so, I am to request that your Department will be so gpod as to furnish, for this purpose, copies of the documents in question in a convenient form. . With regard to the agreements with the Sheikh of Koweit, Sir E. Grey would be glad to know the views of Lord Crewe as to what portions of them should be communicated to the Turkish Government. He presumes that it would not be convenient to divulge, e.g., the annual payment on account of the lease of land to His Majesty’s Government. It is also a matter for consideration whether it would not be more advantageous to defer communicating to the Turkish Government the agreements with the Sheikh of Koweit, until they have intimated whether apart from the terms of those agreements, they are prepared in principle to accept the proposals contained in the memorandum of 29th July. , 1 am Ac., The Under Secretary of State Louis Mallet. for India.

With regard to the 1899 Agreement, Lord Crewe agrees that it might be communicated, with the addition of the note suggested jy the Government of India in lieu of Colonel Meade s letter of the -ord January 1899. s. 121 . A 2There seems no objection to -the communication of the Agreement May 1900 ( arms traffic )’ or 28th February 1904 (post office), ith Reference to the linal paragraph of your letter I am to observe that, since it is not proposed to communicate to the Turkish Government a complete set of our agreements with Koweit, the previous understanding su §£&gt; es f e d in that paragraph seems more than we have a rioffit to demand.

I am to enclose copies of these Ireaties extracted en bloc from Aitchison’s “ Treaties, Engagements, and banads, and to say that Lord Crewe sees no reason why they should not be communicated if Sir E.

But it seems expedient to lemind the Porte that British rights in the Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, but on the custom, consent, and long established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India.

With reference to this Office letter of the 11th September . e communication to the Turkish Government of our treaties with Koweit and other states in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the becietaiy of State for India to inform you that on a further consideration o the terms m which the Government of India proposed to define our obligations towards the Sheikh of Koweit he finds himself no longer able to concur m them. ' &amp; The telegrams of 4th December 1901 and 14th October 1902 on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the tact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikhs territory as described in Lorimer’s Gazetteer would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defendino- them As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of 8th April last, the term “good ofhces ” (which by Colonel Meade’s letter of -ord Janurry 1899 we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a con- venienth vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor sale to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majestv’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will moreover have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. „ , 1118 Lol ' ds hip would, therefore, suggest that the formula should run (t 8 -L e £ a . 1 Fas Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh u °i . 0Tve l! ; 80 l° rj &amp; as he and his heirs and successors act up to (&lt; the ! r obligations under the Agreement His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices.” With pci haps the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to them selves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.

In compliance with the request which, under instructions from your Government, you were good enough to make to me on the ICth ultimo, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of the agreements, as marked in the margin, concluded by His Majesty’s Government with the Trucial Chiefs of Oman and the Sheiks of Bahrein and Koweit, to which reference is made in the Memorandum communi cated to Your Highness on 29th July last. With respect to these agreements, His Majesty’s Government have the following observations to make : — As regards No. 1, His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. His Majesty’s Government hold moreover a lease of land from the Sheikh of Koweit. As regards No. 4, His Majesty’s Government take occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, and transmitted herewith to the Ottoman Government, but on the custom, consent, and long established relations between.the local chiefs and the Government of India. His Majesty’s Government hope that in the communication of these agreements, together with the supplementary declarations which are hereby brought to the notice of the Ottoman Government, the Sublime Porte will see proof of His Majesty’s Government’s goodwill and desire to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiations set forth in their above- mentioned memorandum.

If a steam, launch is provided, it is essential that a coaling station, to be located on the site above- mentioned, should be established, since the acquisition of a site by His Majesty's Government could not other wise fail to arouse the susceptibilities of other Powers m I am therefore to express the hope that the Lords Commissioners will reconsid,er their decision not to contribute towards the cost of purchase and upkeep of a launch.5 - • \ ' From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 13th July 1910. -p—Depot at Koweit.

J 2. We have now the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty's Government, copies of the papers cited in the annexed schedule on the above subject and also on the question of the selection of sites for (1) the rectangular plot of ground at Bunder Shweikh leased by the Sheikh of Koweifc to the British Government in 1907, and (2) the proposed coal depdt at Koweit. 3. W ith regard to the proposal to transfer the coaling station at Bushire to Koweit, our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in his letter No. 955, dated the 5th May 1907, brought to notice that the actual coaling work at Bushire, which was done under a contract arrangement with a local trader, was carried on under circumstances of great difficulty, and that the harbour itself had many disadvantages. He represented that at Koweit the harbour was much more sheltered and convenient for large vessels, and that the more frequent appearance there of our ships, which would result, would have a uselul effect in other ways. He accordingly submitted for our consideration the desirability of closing the depdt at Bushire and establishing one at Koweit. He agreed, when consulted by us, that the Bunder Shweikh foreshore was suited for the location of the coaling station. Sir George Warrender, the then Naval Commander-in-Chief, was of the same opinion and had no objection to the proposed transfer. Particulars, based on estimates submitted bv the Political Agent at Koweit, as to the cost of establishing a coal depbt at Koweit, were furnished by our Political Resident in his letter No. 91 m, dated the 22nd March 1908, but it was considered desirable to have esti mates of the cost of the project prepared by a qualified engineer officer, and the Bombay Government were accordingly asked, in July 1908, to arrange for the submission, in consultati &gt;n with the Political Agent at Kovveit, of detailed estimates of the cost of erecting three godowns at Koweit of a type suitable to the locality and of constructing a permanent coaling jetty. In July of the following year, the Bombay Government reported that a survey was necessary, but that it could not be undertak-n as the Politi cal Agent at Koweit (Major Knox) had reported that no arrangement for the same had been made with the Sheikh. Our Political Resident w as, thereupon, asked whether he thought it desirable to move in the matter of a survey. In reply, Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, in his letter No. 194J, dated the 8th August 1909, explained that it had not been possible, at a time when a change of Political Agents was imminent, to go into the question of the delimitation of the limits of our rectangular Concession and the selection within it of the most convenient point for the location of a coal depot, but that, as soon as Captain Shakcspear, the present Political Agent, had become acquainted with local conditions, the Commander of H.M.8. “Lapwing ' had been deputed to make a survey of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore in consultation with him.List of Enclosures in Secret despatch No. 77 (External), dated the 9th June 1910, from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.

C.—24 and C.—28, dated 29th May 1911 and 14th June 1911, respectively, herewith returned with accompaniments and to the correspondence ending with Government memorandum No. C.—44, dated 6th October 1911, I have the honour to forward amended plans and estimates, the latter amounting to Rs. 51,C01, for the proposed coal shed and pier at Koweit. 2. The plans and estimates have been prepared generally in accordance with the wishes of His Excellency, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, as contained in the copies of the memoranda attached to the Government memoranda. 3. The figure quoted by His Excellency as the probable cost at which the shed, pier, and quarters for the staff, could be erected was T3,000 or Rs. 45,000. This figure is exceeded in the present estimates by Rs. 6,601, the excess being due to certain alterations suggested by the Political Agent, Koweit, in his memorandum accompanying his No. C.—57, dated 29th August 1911, copies attached, and to superior construction provided for the quarters for establishment. Differences in rates, prevailing at Koweit and Colombo, also account in part for the excess, 4. Some of the alterations suggested by the Political Agent have not been carried out for reasons detailed below :— (a) Two cook rooms, 11J' X 8' each, have been provided, one for Hindus and the other for Mahomedans, instead of one cook room, 12' x 12', as suggested by the Political Agent. The Executive Engineer states that, even if Hindus are not employed as Lascars, the partition wall between the cook rooms would be useful for different sects. (b) The slope of 1 in 22-85 suggested by the Political Agent for the pier is considered too steep for men wdth heavy loads to use continuously, especially over a length of 250 feet. A slope of 1 in 25 has accordingly been provided. 5. The “ superior construction ” referred to above for the quarters for establishment consists of masonry walls, with roof of corrugated sheets covered with mud, instead of galvanized steel and wood as suggested by His Excellency, the Naval Commander-in-Chief. The latter construction^ if adopted, would render the quarters uninhabitable, during summer, owing to the excessive heat. con 1740aas at Colombo, consequent on the heavy “ Shamab ” wh T 9 ^easity the Gulf during certain seasons of ihe year ° h ar6 preTaleQt Up Eesid I * * * * * 7 enUn%feXsian 0 Gulf ^Bushire™ ^token^Tr 63 ty the 1 Political I have the honour to be, Sir, lour most obedient servant, G.

The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the plans and estimates of tin pioposed coal dep'H at Koweit, forwarded under your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 2055, dated the 12th August 1911. 2 . Such points as occurred to me in examining them I submit in the attached memorandum, and have the honour to return herewith all the estimates and plans in original. One observation I would add, however here, namely that the pier should be completed before the arrival of the iron work for the 'coal shed The work can be carried out largely with local labour, the stone material for it is most easily and cheaply obtained during January to March, and if completed before the arrival of the iron work, its existence and availability will result in a very considerable saving in time and money in the matter of landing and transporting the heavy steel joists and other material to the required site. I have, &amp;c., (Signed.) W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Political Agent, Koweit. Memorandum by the Political Agent on the estimates and plans of the proposed coal depot at Koweit. Site plan .—(Sheets 1 and la). Sheet 1 does not show under-water contours and consequently the best site for the pier does not seem to have been selected. I have prepared and attached a new site plan (sheet la) which gives a number of data which may prove useful to the Public Works Department. On this new site plan I have shown the position and bearing of the boundaries and altered the situation of the coal shed and establishment’s quarters to the most advantageous positions. I have left 90 feet space between the quarters and the coal shed to admit of the possible future addition of another span of 40 feet to the present shed on the west side. For the rest the plan is self-explanatory and I would suggest that it (or its recommendations) be substituted for the original one prepared in the Executive Engineer’s office. Coal shed .—Estimates and plans (sheets 2, 3, 4 and 5). I have no comment to make on these which seem suitable beyond that all foundations for the R. S. Stanchions and uprights should be of Portland Cement (not lime) Concrete. Fencing .—Estimates and plan (sheet 6). I have no comment to make on this beyond that all foundations for standards and Gate-Posts should be of Portland Cement (not lime) Concrete. Establishment quarters .—Estimates and plans (sheets 1, la and 7). The accommodation provided (3 rooms and a cook room) appears to be inadequate for the staff subsequently suggested in letter No. 3819 of the 1st June 1911 from the Director, Royal Indian Marine, to the Political Residentin the Persian Gulf. Assuming that quarters for the menial establishment only would be required on coal dep6t site, it seems necessary to estimate for the following accommodation :— 1 Office room 15' x 15' (at north end of line). 3 Living rooms 15 x 15 (each to accommodate two lascars). 1 Cook room 12' x 12'. 1 Sweeper’s room 12' x 12'. Foundations and plinth masonry for these quarters should be of stone and Portland Cement Concrete and Portland Cement mortar (not lime). On the superstructure a saving on the estimates should be possible by substituting stone and mud masonry for the outside walls, 2 feet thick, with local mud brick, and mud masonry for the partition walls, feet thick, between rooms in place of the existing specifications, verandah pillars should be of stone and ^ juss masonry; the whole, inside and outside to be plastered with gauged juss plaster ; floors to be ‘ juss ’ plastered 1 inch thick over rammed earth. Ihe type of roof suggested, corrugated iron sheets on steel joists covered with mud, has proved excellent in the case of the Agency Dispensary premises, but instead of 3 inches mud plaster there should be 2 inches mud plaster, 2 inches dry beaten earth, and 2 inches good mud plaster on top. The section on sheet 7 shows the roof to have slopes both to front and rear—one continuous slope to the rear only should be provided so that all rain-water drains to the rear of the quarters. Pier. Estimates and plans (sheets 1, la, and 8). From my site plan (sheet la) it will be apparent that the length of the pier can be shortened by some 15 feet, which should be an economy and has become possible by slight alterations in the pier’s position. At the foot of sheet 8 1 have drawn in a new elevation to suit the new length of pier* two slopes are not required as shown in the original elevation for by raising the pier s height another 9 inches or 1 foot at high-water mark, its usefulness will be improved and the whole slope will become only 1 in 22*85 in place of the original 1 in 26*5. ^ • .. Ifc i wo i u L ld ^ e r a considerable advantage if metalled roads 15 feet wide, similar to the 40 feet road, could be led from the east and west gates of the coal shed to the pier abutment. I have shown this in my site plan. Miscellaneous Notes. As fresh water is not available at site and would be expensive to purchase and also as suitable lime is not procurable locally I have suggested the Port land Cement be used for concrete and mortar throughout, with the salt or ablest site^ 1 avai ab ^ for the foun dations. Excellent sharp sand is avail- No local labour is available for erection of the iron work beyond coolies K 0 n r ]f m ° V1 £ g and n c f r y in g ^ams, &amp;c. All labour for .drilling, rivetting, fixing, bolting, &amp;c., will have to be imported. ^ Local labour is available for building the establishment quarters and pier if a foreman mason and three or four leading stone dressers and masons can be sent to supervise the local talent as well as to work themselves.

Please refer to your letter No. 723- of two and half years f supply as maximum, and as it was merely a case of transferring the Bushire depot to Kuwait, it was presumed that same data would apply. The plans however specifically contemplated that fekart accommodation would only be depot, my letter No. 955, dated May 5th 1907, and subsequent papers will show that my recommendations were influenced by fact that the use of Henjam was not practicable at the time, and that in my opinio^, the position at Kuwait was politically important. The position as regards these two considerations is altered now, and it would appear that all that is at present required is that the coaling needs of the navy should be met in the most economical manner possible. As the recommendations of the Naval Commander-in-Ohief, both as regards pier and sheds, promise to be cheaper than ours, I suggest that they be subjected to examination and estimate by Public IVorks Department. If, however, as I gather from your telegram No. 286-3., dated 30th April, decisions are likely to be reached at any moment, in regard to status of Kuwait and the terminus, Government will doubtless consider whether fc will not be better to suspend final consideration until they are aware of results of negotiations.

His Excellency is being askedto furnish you with specifications and drawings of the type of shed at Colombo. ine plans and estimates received with your letter under reply are returned herewith. I have etc., Sd/- E.H. S. Clarke, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.to/ PRQPOSSD COAL DEPOT AT KUWAIT The proposed Coal Dept at Kuwait is on far too pretentious a scale. It is not necessary to provide for the stowage of more than 3000 tons at the outside and the ordinary amount of coal that should be kept there should not exceed 2000 tons. 2 . The turnover of coal would then take about twelve months which is the extreme limit that Welsh coal should be kept in this climate and even coal of this age will have lost 50 ,£ of its calorific value when it comes to be used. 3. The Admiralty have recently ordered a coal shed for Colombo to contain 20,000 tons. It consists of steel uprights and girders with corrugated iron roof and is of a thoroughly practical nature. There are no sides, but the coal is kept from being stolen by an unclimbahble J fence 7 feet high. I have no doubt that the Contractors would supply a similar shed to the same drawings, only of the size necessary to contain 2880 tons stacked 10 feet high, at a proportionate cost. This would probably not exceed £ 1400 with the necessary fencing, II consider this type of shed far preferable for the storage of coal than the sheds designed. It is considered quite satisfactory at Colombo where there are heeiy rains and strong winds for at least six months in the year and therefore in a dry climate like that of Kuwait there can be no question as to its giving suffi cient protection from the weather. 4. iTith regard to the pier, I do not consider that it is necessary to provide a deep water pier to deal with the coal at this Depot, The amount is so small that the expense would not be justified, I would there fore suggest a short rubble pier to extend below low water mark and alongside the end of which there should be 8 feet at low water. The pier should slope so that the outer end should be 2 feet above the water level at low water and the inner end one foot above the water level at high water. It auqr be constructed of any convenient material, rubble or piles, and should be about 20 feet wide on the platform at the shore end, tapering to not less than 10 feet at the outer end. Lighters would be able to lie alongside this at any state of the tide and thethe coal would be carried to and from the shed by coolies. 5. The location of the shed should be within about 40 or 50 feet of the shore end of the pier so as to minimise the distance that coal has to be carried. 6. A sketch is attached showing the proposed arrangements. 7. An Sstablishment of this kind with quarters for the Staff would probably not exceed £ 3000 to erect. This is less than half the proposed cost and would amply pro- wide for all the necessities of H. M. Ships and the Boyal Indian Marine Ships in the Northern part of the Persian Gulf. 8. If it is oonsidered advisable to erect the larger pier for political reasons, then I would point out that the present design will require considerable modification. The proposed pier which is only suitable for working ooal or light cargo, does not extend far enough out into deep water to enable it to be used by ordinary Merchant Teasels or by H. M. Ships at all times of the tide. There should be at least 26 feet of water at the pier head at L. V. 0. S. 9 otherwise weasels will be obligedobliged to haul off every tide. The pier head should be sufficiently long to enable a collier to lie alongside and work all her holds if quick discharge is required, ?or this purpose it should be increased to SCO feet, 9* I do not consider it necessary to provide a pier for the working of such a small amount of coal as it is proposed to store at Kuwait, and therefore, if the expenditure of public money on it is to be justified, it should be of such a character as to take ordinary he&amp;vv merchandise and to cope with the regular traffic of the Port not only now but also in the future when, if the terminus of the Baghdad Bailway comes to be at Kuwait, the trade will be largely increased. It could then be used as the landing place for all goods, and a small wharfage due would help to cover the money laid out on it. The existence of such a pier would enable us to withstand any proposal to erect other works or quays, and would help to keep the control of the Trke in our own hands, but in order that we should be able to take this line, the Pier must come up to the following standard, at the very least (a)(a) It should have 26 fsst of watar at the head *i Xi« I. 0* S• •- he should be large enough to berth the entire length of a ship. i 1 -) ihe pier should bo strong enough to carry a moTing load of at least 13 tons, i.e. 10 tons plus truck, tare 3 tons; or a standing load of 20 tons, (d) There should be a 10-ton crane prorided at the pier head so as to facilitate discharge. (a) 1 railway line with necessary sidings, in addi tion to the light railway for coaling should be laid so as to connect up eventually with the Baghdad Bailway. It appears however that all that is necessary to be ions at present is to complete the requisite plans and have everything ready to proceed with the constructions directly the main question of the location of the Terminus is decided. 10.

Confidential Sir With reference to your letter of the 9th November 1910, relative to the proposed Coal Depot at Kov/eit, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request you will inform the Secretary of State for India in Council that they note that it is intended to maintain in the Depot a stock of coal equivalent to 2&gt;i years consumption. 2.- Coal is liable to rapid deterioration in a climate such as that of the Persian Gulf, and to ensure against this risk the Admiralty practice, in cases where it is desired to maintain a stock of fuel in excess of a year's turnover, is to keep a stock of coal equivalent to about 1 years expenditure, the balance of the reserve being patent fuel. The stock of patent fuel is completely turned over about every 8 to 10 years. It is suggested that this procedure might with advantage be brought to the notice of the Government of India. I am.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I E , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence on the subject of the proposed coal Depot at Koweit, ending with Foreign Department letter No. 1288-E. A., dated 21st June 1910. 2. Under instructions from his Department, the Sub-Engineer on duty in the Persian Gulf has since visited Kovveit and worked out plans and estimates for the coal godowns, together with plans for the proposed jetty and light tramway, on which estimates will be prepared in Karachi. I enclose a copy of a letter from the Political Agent, Koweit, explaining _ Mr. Starrs’ proceedings in consultation o. -49, ate 2;t juy igio. with himself; also a copy of the plan ^ showing the arrangement proposed for the shed and jetty, which has my approval. 3. The fact that accommodation for 7,500 tons has been estimated for \ instead of 3,600, the amount taken into calculation by Major Knox in making his tentative proposals and endorsed by me in my letter No. 912, dated 22nd March 1908, needs some explanation. I beg reference to paragraph fi) of the ,f Memorandum about Bushire Coal Depot ” enclosed with the communication just quoted. It is true that the average annual consumption at Bushire is about 3,000 tons, but the fact that by the rule of &lt;£ established proportions, ” on the basis of which the Bushire Depot is worked, we are directed to maintain 2^ years supply in order to be prepared for emergencies, was not sufficiently taken into account. In Bushire owing to the impracticability of obtaining sufficient accommodation for 7oOO tons, the difficulty has to be got over by our receiving our coal in frequent small consignments ; but this is both an expensive arrangement to Government and a troublesome one to this Residency, and therefore in opening a new Depot where | we have plenty of room, it seemed advisable that an estimate on the 2% years supply basis should at any rate be placed before Government. , Mr. Storrs was accordingly directed to prepare his plan and estimates on the latter basis and this he has done ; but the accommodation has been designed and estimated for in such a manner (by providing 7 sheds to hold about 1,000 tons each) that the Government of India can proceed with the project piecemeal as it were according to the probable requirements of the near future, from time to time. 4. Having regard to the tentative estimates submitted by Major Knox in 1908, I fear the Government of India may find the present proposals somewhat formidable, as the cost of the 7 godowns works out to Rs. 1,43,247 and the quarters for the coaling establishment to Rs. 2,654. Total Rs. 1,45,900. On the basis of the rent paid in Bushire for the accommodation of 2,800 tons coal, Vi's., Rs. 1,715 per annum, the sum which would have to be paid for renting accommodation for 7,500 tons works out to Rs. 4,594. By building the Depot now proposed, Government will thus be saving an amount which repre sents 3'2 per cent on their capital outlay of Rs. 1,43,247. Regarded as interest on capital outlay, this may not seem a handsome return, but even with 3 godowns to start with, more accommodation would be provided than is at present available at Bushire, and in any case, there should be a considerable saving in the cost of the landing of coal and the coaling of ships, as was pointed out by Major Knox in his letter No. 39, dated 22nd January 1908. Moreover the buildings will be of a solid and permanent character and will be valuable evidence of our predominant position in Koweit. For these reasons, 1 very much hope that the Government of India will be pleased to consider the project favourably. 5.

No. C-49 (Confidential), dated Koweit, the 27th July 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your letter No. 1978, dated the 20th July 1910, I have the honour to report that Mr. Storrs, Assistant Engineer, Public Works Depart ment, has been over the ground with me and made a survey for the proposed coal Depot at Koweit. ^ 2. In the first place it will be well to state the reasons for selecting the exact spot shown on the block plan, which Mr. Storrs will submit to you in person. When the survey was carried out by the officers of H. M. S. “Lapwing” last year, a section on a line N. 42 W. from a point (marked Y on the plan) * 59 y ar ds distant north-east of the Sheikh’s coal-shed was given and it was shown that the foreshore from that point became gradually steeper as the Sheikh’s shed was approached. Subsequently His Majesty’s Government decided to make the Sheikh’s shed the centre of the British concession, with its length running N. 60 E. and S. 60 W. Consequently it became unnecessary to take as the boundary between the Sheikh’s enclave and our proposed depot a line more than 150 cubits (75 yards) distant from the Sheikh’s coal-shed instead of 1 59 yards and running N. 30 W. and S. 30 E. The north-west angle of the Sheikh s shed proved to give almost exactly the centre on this bearing and all measurements were therefore based on that point. By this means a rather better site than that advocated in my letter No. 414 of the 28th July 1909 is possible, with a maximum variation in level of 1*3 feet only and good ground for foundations throughout. 3. After consideration and discussion with the Assistant Engineer the arrangement of the coal godowns shown in his pla/n was adopted. The godowns are calculated to hold 1 ,ooo tons of coal each normally—that is if filled to a height of 10 feet above the floor. In case of necessity, each godown can temporarily accommodate with safety another 200 tons leaving 3 feet clearance to the roof.^ Thus normally the depot will store 7,000 tons and can accommo date a maximum of 8,400 tons under cover. TJ le ., 1 arra ?S ements in each godown are exactly similar—with a single row of pillars in the centre to support the roof : two lines of ventilating shafts: roof of mud on galvanized iron sheets laid on steel joists: two sliding or rolling gates or doors also of iron or steel. A rough estimate works out to about Rs. 1,40,000 for the seven godowns ; it will, however, be subjected to revision in the prevailing rates for local materials and labour, with a more accurate estimate of which I was able to furnish Mr. Storrs and this should reduce the above figure. Quarters for the tindal and 2 watchmen were also included in the plan at an estimated cost of under Rs. 5,000. In the whole depot wonH has been avoided as being expensive to obtain in Koweit, perishable, and liable to assist a spontaneous fire. The buildings as suggested are absolutely fireproof with the exception of the doors and windows in the quarters. . 4 - The situation of the godowns with reference to each other has been a-^d at on the supposition that a small tramway will eventually be laid, and to afford the most efficient and expeditious handling of the coal, whilst leaving ample space for weighing and stacking of weighed bags ready for instant shipment. No estimate of the tramway or pier was made as Mr. Storrs informed me this would be done in the Executive Engineer’s office in Karachi. On the plan, however, a pier with a T-head has been shown extending to the 3-fathom line as most suitable to local requirements. If iron piles are used for this work,excellent foundations in coral rock will be found and silting is not likely to result, whilst the T-head wdll admit of shallow-draft ships loading coal direct from the pier, and, should lighters be necessary, several could be worked simultaneously. !t is not recommended that the tramway should be carried along, though it should reach to, the T-head of the pier, for the reason that on this portion it will be ^ convenient to stack a large quantity of coal if urgency in loading is anticipated. &amp; 7 s 5. My endeavour has been to submit a scheme which shall give the maxi mum of expedition and efficiency in coaling, while bearing in mind that future requirements are likely to exceed the present and so to avoid a design which would not admit of easy expansion at the same time keeping cost as low as possible. 6, Should it be decided to proceed with any part of the work in the current or next financial year, l would suggest that I be authorised as soon as possible to collect and stack coral stone on the site gradually, in order to avoid a sudden rise of price, for this material is not easily obtained at short notice and more over is improved by being exposed to the weather for some months before being used for buildings./ lb^(- ^ ^ Ve ry ' ^ ° ?&gt;t rf H ( V ponfl dant ial , k .1 CfcV ,ro» TV ' v * ^ The Deputy Secretary to the ao^ernment of India in the Foreign Department, To The Hon^le Mr. ¥.

With re ^ ard to tlle P ro P osal to transfer the coaling station at Bushire to Koweit, our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in his letter No. 955 dated the 5th May 1907, brought to notice that the actual coaling uork at •Bushire, which was done under a contract arrangement with a local trader was carried on under circumstances of great difficulty, and that the harbour itself had many disadvantages. He represented that at Koweit the harbour was much more sheltered and convenient for large vessels, and that the more frequent appearance there of our ships, which would result, would have a useiul effect in other ways. He accordingly submitted for our consideration the desirability of closing the dep6t at Bushire and establishing one at Kovveit He agreed, when consulted by us, that the Bunder Shweikh foreshore was suited for the location of the coaling station. Sir George Warrender, the then Naval Commander-in-Chief, was of the same opinion and had no objection to tiie proposed transfer. Particulars, based on estimates submitted by the Political Agent at Koweit, as to the cost of establishing a coal depot at Koweit, were furnished by our Political Resident in his letter No. 913 dated the 22nd March 1908, but it was considered desirable to have esti*'' mates of the cost of the project prepared by a qualified engineer officer, and the Bombay Government were accordingly asked, in July 1908, to arrange for the submission, in consultation with the Political Agent at Koweit, of detailed estimates of the cost of erecting three godowns at Koweit of a type suitable to the locality and of constructing a permanent coaling jetty. In July of the following year, the Bombay Government reported that a survey was necessary, but that it could not be * undertaken as the Politi- cal Agent at Koweit (Major Knox) had reported that no arrangement for the same had been made with the Sheikh. Our Political Resident was, thereupon, asked whether he thought it desirable to move in the matter of a survey. In reply, Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, in his letter No. 1917, dated the 8th August'' 1909, explained that it had not been possible, at a time when a change of Political Agents was imminent, to go into the question of the delimitation of the limits of our rectangular Concession and the selection within it of the most convenient point for the location of a coal depot, but that, as soon as Captain Shakespear, the present Political Agent, had become acquainted with local conditions, the Commander of H.M.S. “Lapwing ” had been deputed to make a survey of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore in consultation with kiin.4. The results of the survey were reported in Lieu tenant-Colonel Cox’s letter last cited, and sites were suggested for the location of our rectangular Concession and the proposed coal depot. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox saw no reason to differ from the opinion of the local officers in regard to their selection of the ^ site for the coal depot and suggested expert examination of the larger question. 5. The present Naval Commander-in-Chief considers that the location of the Concession should he such that the Sheikh’s coal shed would be exactly in the middle of the frontage, and the site proposed by him is indicated by the rectangle shown by a chain-dotted line on the largest of the tracings attached {^'Lieutenant-Colonel Cox’s letter referred to above. Major Trevor, First Assistant Resident, in charge of the Bushire Residency, sees no objection to the Naval Commander-in-Chief’s proposal. 6. We agree with the opinion of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, and if the site is approved by His Majesty’s Government, we propose to inform our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that its boundaries should not be formally demarcated by pillars—enclosure of the First Assistant Resident’s letter No. 654, dated the 13th March 1910. 7. We also recommend the proposal to transfer the coaling station at officers. We would invite attention to the opinion expressed in the letter from the Foreign Office to the Treasury, dated the 16th September 1907, that, if a launch were provided for the Political Agent at Koweit, it was essential that a coaling station, to be located on the Bunder Shweikh foreshore site, should be established, since the acquisition of a site by His Majesty’s Government could not otherwise fail to arouse the susceptibilities of other Powers. A launch has since been provided for the Political Agent. The expenditure connected with the establishment of a coal depot at Koweit will, as in the \ case of the coaling station at Bushire, be borne by the Indian Government. 8. Pending the approval of His Majesty’s Government to this proposal, and with a view to save time, we have asked the Bombay Government to arrange for the preparation of detailed estimates for the project on the supposi tion that the site now recommended for the location of the coal depot will be the one which will ultimately be decided on. • Vide enclosure No. 9.

(i i!) m No. 955^ dated Bushire, the 5th (received 13th) May 1907. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To Sir Louis W. Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to make a reference on the subiect of the arrangements now existing for the coaling of the ships of His Majesty’s Navy and the Hoyal Indian Marine in these waters west of Karachi, and especially at Bushire. 2. The Government of India are no doubt aware that coal is obtainable at— (a) Maskat—Government Depot. (ft) Bushire—Government Depot. (c) Bussorah—Depot of private British firm. As regards Maskat, I have no special observations to make. It is neces sary and important for us to have a coaling station there and the facilities ob tainable, subject to the limited resources of the port in regard to coolies and lighters, are considerable. 3. Near the entrance to the Persian Gulf we have no coal, Basidu having fallen into desuetude as a coaling dep6t for some 20 years past. It would no doubt prove very convenient to His Majesty’s ships which are, I believe, under standing orders to call there on their way up and down the Gulf if we had a store at Henjam but until the nature of our occupation is finally decided, it would be impolitic to take any action in regard to that island which might possibly introduce a fresh element of difficulty in our negociations with the Persian Government. 4. I now come to the case of Bushire. This Depot is, like that at Maskat, maintained by the Marine Department of the Government of India. The coal Hangars are rented and the handing of the coal is done under a contract arrangement with a local trader. The actual coaling work is carried on under circumstances of great difficulty. The harbour is very treacherous for many months of the year for native boats and except in the latter part of the hot weather, perhaps from July to November, wind is apt to get up very quickly and it is impossible to rely on the calmness of the sea for two days together. Moreover, only the smaller ships can venture into the inner anchorage 31- miles from the shore. The larger vessels such as His Majesty’s ships “ Hyacinth,“ Proserpine, ” “ Fox” cannot enter and when they are driven to take coal have to do so from the outer anchorage 7 or 8 miles away. Another difficulty is that we have no direct control over coolies, boats, or boatmen, and owing to the vagaries of one and all and the difficulty of coaling ships at such long distances from the shore, the process is a most trying one both to those concerned with the ships at sea and with the coal on shore. The natural consequence is that vessels as a rule avoid coaling at Bushire and the depot is chiefly used for the requirements of the R.I.M.S. &lt;c Lawrenceand of the subsidised ships occasionally. 5. Now the “Lawrence” and His Majesty’s three subsidised ships “ Sphinx, ” “ Lapwing ” and “ Redbreast, ” can all coal without inconveni ence and with much greater practical facility at Bussorah, where a store of coal is kept for sale to any vessel that may require it, by a local British merchant. It would seem therefore that if we only had to consider smaller ships in this part of the Gulf, their needs could be supplied entirely by the Bussorah Contractor, but in the absence of coal at Henjam it is no doubt necessary that we should have some coal in the north of the Gulf available in case of urgency for ships of any ordinary draft. I have the honour in this connection to ask that the Government of India will be pleased to consider, in consultation with the Naval Authorities, whether 1the coaling station at Bushire could not conveniently and usefully be dispensed with and replaced by one at Koweit, where the harbour is much more sheltered and convenient for large vessels and where the more frequent appearance of our ships which would result, would have a useful effect in other ways. I should mention that even if the Government Depot at Bushire were done away with, there would almost invariably, as now, be a store of coal in the godowns of one of the British Shipping Agents as at Bussorah, and as far as the “ Lawrence’’ is concerned it would be no more trouble for her to go to Koweit or Bussorah for coal than to go for water to the Shatt-el-Arab, which she has to do regularly in any case. Should it be considered necessary to maintain any fixed arrangement at Bushire, it might be held sufficient to enter into a contract with some local merchant in which he would undertake to have not less than 500 tons always available and to sell it to us at a fixed rate. 6. I recognise that this is a question which primarily concerns the Naval Authorities, but as a depot at Koweit seems politically and practically to have a good many advantages over one at Bushire, I have ventured to solicit consi- * See Progs.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. With reference to Foreign Department telegram No. S-445, dated 26th September 1907, regarding the proposed (1) Captain Trevor's letter No. 127, dated 7th establishment of a Coal Depot at Koweit, January 1908, With one enclosure. tt. n (2) Major Knox's letter No. 39, dated 22nd Janu- 1 have the honour to lorward a Copy 01 ary, with one enclosure. ^he marginally cited correspondence which has passed between this office and the Political Agent, Koweit, on the subject. 2. Major Knox estimates the cost of building 3 godowns to hold 3,600 tons of coal besides allowing air space and room to work in, at Rs. 35,000, but he thinks that by a careful manipulation of the exchange between dollar and rupee and by importing for that purpose dollars from Bombay, much economy might be effected. I have no comments to offer on the estimates which have been framed with the local knowledge of the rates of labour and prices of materials and I think that they may be accepted unless the Government of India decide to have them prepared by the Assistant Engineer Persian Gulf subdivision. 3. Next comes the question of coaling charges. These Major Knox puts down as follows in a subsequent communication— (а) for ships coaling off Bunder Shweikh @ Bs. 0-15-0 per ton ; (б) for ships coaling in usual anchorage @ B-s. 1-14-0 per ton. These rates include weighing and bagging (cost of bags inclusive), putting into boats, boat hire and stacking into bunkers on board the ship; they do not, however, seem to take into account the wear and tear of the bags and the cost of mending and replacing those that have become unserviceable. I think there fore that Bs. 1-8-0 and Bs. 2-0-0 per ton would be about the correct rates for coaling in Bunder Shweikh and in the present anchorage, respectively. In Bushire we pay Bs. 2 per ton when coaling in the inner harbour and Bs. 2-4-0 per ton in the outer anchorage. 4 . Then comes the question of Establishment Charges. Major Knox pro poses 2 watchmen as permanent establishment and thinks that the duties of tindal and weighman can best be entrusted to the Indian crew of the Political Agent’s launch. I do not, however, consider that it would be feasible to utilise their services in coaling matters. I doubt whether the crew would be always available for coaling work, as they will have their own work in the launch to attend to, and it may not unfrequently happen that the launch is away when a ship has to be coaled. I think therefore that the Coal Depot should have its own separate perma nent establishment, consisting of a tindal and. 2 weighmen. These men should be located at the Dep6t and act as watchmen as well. The rate of pay which may have to be allowed to secure good men may be roughly estimated as follows:— 1 Tindal @ Rs. 35 per mensem. 2 Watchmen @ Rs. 25 each per mensem. The total cost of establishing a Coal Dep6t at Koweit would thus be — Initial Charges Bs. 35,0C0. Recurring charges .— Rs. Wages ... ... ... ... ... 1,020 per annum. Petty repairs, etc. (say)... ... ... ... 80 „ „ Total ... 1,100 per annum.The cost of the present Bushire Dep6t is as follows Rent of godowns ... (1) 2 at Rs. 80 per mensem ... (2) 5 at Krans 220 per mensem ... (1) 1 Tindal at Rs. 20 per mensem. (2) 2 Weighmen at Rs. 12 each per mensem =44 per mensem ... 528 per annum. ... 2,300 per annum. By the transfer of the Dep&amp;t to Koweit a saying of Rs. 1,200 per annum would be effected in recurring expenditure, and we should be left with the initial cost estimated for managing the Dep6t, namely, Us. 35,000. 5. With regard to the construction of a jetty and a light tramway which have been suggested by Major Knox. I fully concur with him that if these projects were carried out the coaling arrangements in Koweit would be placed on a very satisfactory footing, which would no doubt be welcomed by the Navy. The expediency or otherwise of incurring this expenditure now seems to depend upon the question of the degree of importance with which Koweit is likely to be invested in the near future. This question will no doubt receive due consideration at the hands of Government. No. 127, dated Busbire, the 7th January 1908. From— Captain A. P. Trevor, for Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Political Agent, Koweit. I have the honour to inform you that the Government of India have under consideration the question of abolishing the Government Coal Depot at Bushire (where as you are aware the conditions for coaling ships are extremely incon venient) and of creating one at Koweit instead. I am desired to report the initial and recurring expenditure in connection with the Depot at Bushire, and to give similar estimates of probable initial and recurring cost in case of Koweit. I attach a memorandum giving details regarding the Bushire Dep6t, and request that you will put me in possession as far as possible of similar informa tion and estimates for Koweit. Memorandum about Bushire Coal Dep6t. (1) On an average 3,000 tons are required per annum, but the quantity demanded annually is regulated on the basis of the average consumption of the three previous years, and the result arrived at is multiplied by 2^ so as to com plete the supply for 2J years which we are supposed to keep in stock. (a) (2) We have the following buildings for storing coal in Bushire, viz* (o) a caravanserai contain ing 3 godowns of the dimensions given in the margin; (5) one godown large and 3 godowns small, dimensions as per margin. No venti lators are required if properly covered coal- sheds are built after the fashion of the 2 godowns of uniform dimensions:— r Length 5 Breadth ... ... C. Height ... •»• fl godown: — Length ...

I am trying to have a sketch of them taken for the information of Major Knox. (3). Our coal establishment here, which was only sanctioned in July 1906* consists as follows 1 Tindal on Rs. 20=75 Krans. 2 Weighmen on Rs. 12=45 Krans each, and I think the same strength will have to he engaged at Koweit. I would however observe that if a trustworthy man as a contractor for shipping and landing coal could be found in Koweit, who could also be entrusted with the custody of the coal under the supervision of the Political Agent’s Office, there would be no need for a Coal Establishment. Of course the Contractor will require liberal treatment in the matter of rates for shipping and landing coal. Here we pay Rs. 2 per ton for shipping coal in the inner anchorage and Rs. 2-4 per ton in the outer anchorage. The charges for shipping include labour for weighing and bagging the coal, putting it into lighters, conveying to the ship to be coaled, and putting and storing it on board. The charges also include the cost of gunny bags. The charges for landing include lighterage from ship to shore and stacking the coal in the godowns. The Contractor here is supposed to have about 200 tons bagged and ready for immediate shipment. A regular contract will have to be drawn more or less on the lines indicated here.

They would represent 172,800 cubic feet, which should accommodate at 48 cubic feet per ton 3,600 tons. Allowing for air space and room to work in this does not seem excessive. The estimates are pitched rather high on purpose. Much economy might he effected by careful management of the dollar. A chest of $10,000 might be brought from Bombay. It will be noticed that 21 years rental at Bushire rates would pay for the initial cost and repairs of a substantial stucture like the above should be trifling. The duties of tindal and weigbmen could best be entrusted to the Indian crew of the Political Agent’s launch and their labour paid for by the job at 4 annas per ton. A couple of local watchmen would be required, and it would be necessary to pay them at high rates of pay, living at that distance from that town. Rs. 25 per mensem would suffice per man, but they would have to be supplied with water, which would cost; initial storage tank Rs. 60 = recurring monthly Rs. 15. TRe recurring expenditure would have to be doubled probably for the Indian crew of steam launch. As regards loading the coal, the most simple, though certainly ^ costly, arrangement would be a jetty, extreme length 200 yards which would bring one into 20 feet of water at lowest tides and alongside which most ships likely to want coal here for sometime could lie. The cost of this is a matter for experts. Expert knowledge would also be able to say whether alight tramway, say 250 yards long straight from the coal-sheds to the sea, along which truck-loads could be shoved right up to the ship’s side, would not reduce the time and labour of loading and unloading to a minimum. The jetty would of course be useful for many other purposes. Coolies are procurable, but would require a high wage, probably two dollars per day per head. Steamer wants 200 tons estimated cost of coolie labour. Required gang of 60 men working one whole working day at $2 per head $120 = Rs. 204. With the trucks and tramway, 40 men would suffice and do the job quicker. We must add cost of bagging coal. But the whole thing should be done within Rs. 1-8 per ton, exclusive of cost of building jetty, tramway, godowns, provision of trucks and repairs to above plus cost of permanent establishment. S. G.

Z. Cox, C.S.L, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Foreign Department letter No. 1210E.A., dated 24th July 1909, forwarding a copy of a letter from the Secretary to the Government of Bombay in the Public Works Department, on the subject of the projected coal depot at Koweit. 2. It will be understood that it was inconvenient that the somewhat difficult questions of, firstly, the delimitation of the precise limits of our Concession and, secondly, the selection of the most convenient point within it for the location of a coal depdt. should be gone into on the spot just as a change of Political Agents was imminent. Hence Major Knox’s reply to the late Assistant Engineer Mr. Laffbre. As soon, however, as Captain Shakespear had settled down, the matter was taken up and the Senior Naval Officer was requested to be good enough to depute one of His Majesty’s Ships, when a convenient opportunity offered, to ( 1 ) Political Agent, Koweit,to Resident, No 414 , make a. survey of the foreshore of Bunder da W led^Narfro'fficer t oR.«ide»t, No. p.-o, Shweikh in consultation with the Political dated 5 th August 1909 , with enclosure and survey Agent. H.M.S. “Lapwing,” Lieutenant- pIan * Commander MacLean, was in due course deputed for the work, and I am now able to submit the results in the form of the communications and accompaniments marginally-cited. 3. The position to start with is briefly this. Our Concession must contain the Sheikh's enclave, which must contain the Sheikh’s coal-shed, which was already built, on precisely what proves to be the most desirable spot on the whole foreshore, before the negotiations commenced. Our selection of ground, therefore, must be within certain preliminary limits, determined by the position of the Sheikh’s shed. Within these limits there seems to be no practical doubt as to which will be the most convenient spot for our coal depot. The selection of the best site of our Concession, however, is obviously a problem of great moment, and I have no doubt the Government of India will decide to refer the question with the H.M.S. “ Lapwing’s ” survey, to His Majesty's Government for decision under the advice of the Admiralty. 4. It was found by the Political Agent and Lieutenant-Commander MacLean in the course of the present operations that the English text of the Second Clause of the first condition of the agreement, as rendered by Major Knox in the translation forwarded with his letter No. 551, dated 16th October 1907, was incapable of practical interpretation on the ground, and on reference to the vernacular original and to certain demi-official explanations written to the Residency by Major Knox while the negotiations were in progress, it became (,) Demi-official comomnicaHo. from Political to me his translation needed Agent, Koweit, to First Assistant Resident, dated amendment. It is on the amended version, 14 th August 1907 (with plan). which 1 now enclose a codv together (a) Demi-official letter from Political Agent, Oi wuilu i uuw cnciusc copy, lugeuiei Koweit, to First Assistant Resident, dated later, with COpiCS of the demi-official papers 0 °( 3 ) 4 Draf U t S oi St Re?'e&lt;i Version recommended lor above-mentioned, that the reports of the translation of condition i, Clause 2, Bunder Political Agent and Lieutenant-Comman- Shweikh Agreement. j er M ac Lean, an&lt; ^ rri y present observa tions, are based. I beg that the said revised version, including the punctuation, may be closely examined, and if it is held to be correct, it may replace the previous translation on the record. 5. If I may be pardoned for making a simple suggestion. In order to realise readily on the survey plan the limits of our sphere of selection, it is convenient to cut out of the centre of a piece of card a rectangle showing the size of our Concession, drawn to the scale of the Survey; then one can see the limits of the field of choice for the location of our Concession compatible with the retention of the Sheikh’s enclave in or on its seaward face. I say because it will be remembered that everything to seaward between the prolonga tion of the side boundaries, up to the 3 fathom line, goes with the Concession.2 6. Assuming, as I believe to be the case, that the views of the two officers concerned as to the best site for the coal dep6t, as contained in their present reports, are based on a correct interpretation of the Agreement, I see no reason to differ from them, and therefore, if opportunity offers, I think no harm will be done, while time will be saved, if the Assistant Engineer makes his preliminary estimates on the provisional supposition that the site now recommended is the one which will ultimately be decided upon. In the meanwhile, I beg that the larger question may be subjected to expert examination as soon as practicable. a coal-depot at this port ending with this office letter No. 39, dated the 22nd January 1908. 2. The arrival of a launch for this Agency having made the matter of sto rage of coal for her use one of some urgent necessity, I have the honour to ad dress you on the two much more important subjects upon which this matter will depend for settlement, m 3 ., the exact situation of the Bander Shweikh foreshore concession leased from Sheikh Mubarak in October 1907, and the institution and location of a properly equipped coal depot. 3. A reference to the lease Agreement forwarded with my predecessor’s letter No. 551, dated the 16th October 1^,07, show's that the British Government has the option of so seeding its ground that a rectangle 7,500 cubits by 600 cubits 13,750 yards by 300 yards) may be taken up anywhere along the Bunder Shweikh foreshore with the following reservations :— (a) That the long seaward boundary of the rectangle shall lie through the existing coal-shed belonging to the Sheikh. (£) That this long side shall also correspond with 11 the sea-line ” (pre sumably high-water mark, as far as is consistent with its being a perfectly straight line. (t) That the rectangle shall extend only 600 cubits (300 yards) in depth from this line for the landward boundary. (d) That in the rectangle on the seaward side there shall be an enclave a square of 300 cubits (150 yards) side, the property of the (e) That in this square shall be situated the Sheikh existing coal-shed, though the actual area of the coal-shed is excluded from that of the square. The British Government is further entitled to ah ground above or below water contained between the prolongations of the two short (east and west) sides of the rectangle as far as the three-fathom line at low water springs, excluding that portion contained between the prolongations of the east and west sides of the Sheikh's enclave. The British Government has also the right to lay buoys and navigation marks anywhere in Koweit territory and to ouild jetties, coal- sheds, etc , within the limits defined above. 4. To obtain full advantage of this Concession, I presume as fundamental that that portion of the harbour should be secured w'hich will give the maximum area of deep water necessary for a good anchorage near enough to the shore to enable possible piers and wharf-walls to be constructed without abnormal expen diture owing to distance and heavy work. 5. From a reference to the plan supplied by H.M.S. “ Lapw ing’s” recent surveys, it will be seen that the Sheikh’s existing coal-shed occupies the best possible site along the whole foreshore, the three and four-fathom lines being No. 414, dated Koweit, the 28th July 1909. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. /1 I have the honour to refer to the correspondence regarding the location of Sheikh.only ioo and 150 yards distant respectively from the high-water mark, within a few feet of which the shed stands. On both sides of the Sheikh’s coal-shed, the tnree-tathom line gradually draws further and further away from high-water mark until, at a point 1,600 yards east of the Sheikh’s shed, it is 400 yards from hi^h- water mark and, taking a sharp bend to the north, narrows the deep-water chan nel and gives a large area of the haroour near the town only 2 fathoms or less water. On the westward the same gradual receding takes place for 1,100 yards from the Sheikh s shed, and the three-fathom line is then 300 yards distant from • u mar k » f° r the next 1,000 yards to the west there is slightly less water with the three-fathom line averaging about 500 yards distant from high-water mark; further west still, the deep-water (*&gt;,, anything more than three-fathoms) again narrows and the end of the harbour is reached. Along nearly the whole length of the foreshore, the bottom appears to be solid dead coral rock with mud and sand covering it in varying shallow depths, whilst in places it appears bare as a reef. All along the shore, therefore, good solid foundations will be found for either masonry or pile-work. 6 . I attach a tracing of a section prepared by H M.S. “ Lapwing ” on a line passing through a spot 159 yards north by 48 east from the Sheikh’s coal- shed, which gives a very good idea of the fall for some 1,000 yards of the shore line. Commander MacLean of H. M. S. “ Lapwing ” and I went thoroughly over and discussed all the ground, and both agreed in the conclusion that the best site for any proposed coal-sheds was undoubtedly as close as possible to the Sheikh’s shed on the eastward and the spot through which the section attach ed hereto passes was selected so as to give a clear 150 yards for the Sheikh’s enclave; between this spot and the Sheikh's shed the section improves by becom ing steeper, whilst it deteriorates further eastward by becoming less steep. An alternative site presented itself at about the same distance to the west of the Sheikh’s shed, but we found that a large area above the actual high-water mark, as shown on the chart, is liable to flooding at springtides, and this fact would necessitate the construction of a long seawall, some 1,800 yards at least, with high plinths and much filling work behind it, to allow of buildings remaining sufficiently dry ; moreover the section was hardly as steep from high-water mark to the three-fathom line. 7. I trust that the above paragraph will give sufficiently clearly the best site for any buildings or coal depot now proposed. We can now turn to a consider ation of the rest of the area. From the details given in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above, I am of opinion—and I think I have Commander MacLean’s support from a seaman’s point of view—that the best site for our rectangular Concession will be with the seaward (north-west) boundary line running about north 64 east and south 64’west through the northernmost corner of the Sheikh’s coal shed with some 1,600 yards to the eastward and 2,150 yards to the westward of that shed. My reasons for this suggestion are the following:— (a) Commencing from the easternmost point, we-shall have our frontage (including the Sheikh’s enclave) for nearly 1,600 yards practically on the high-water mark ; buildings, piers, etc., can be conveniently erected along the whole of this frontage economically as necessity arises, without any ex;ra expenditure for seawalls, etc. (b) The next 1,800 yards is made up of three portions, along the whole front of which a heavy seawall or wharf will be required if the perfectly straight line is to be preserved and the overflow at high spring tides is to be kept out of the Concession. The first portion, 600 yards, varies from high-water mark down o the two fathom line : the second 550 yards, from the two-fathom line down to three fathoms and up again to two ; the third 650 yards from the two-fathom line up to high-water mark again. (c) The last 350 yards is all above high-water mark on comparatively high ground with a small area of dry ground to the front (north west side). Portion (a) will meet all our possible requirements unless a vast change takes place in the importance of Koweit as a port, such as would result from itsbecoming the terminus of the Baghdad Railway. In the event of this change taking place general, financial and political considerations would at once make it worth while proceeding with harbour works along portions (£) and (c). In the meantime, if my suggested location of the Concession meets with approval, we hold practically all the available moorings for any ship drawing 20 feet or more with no single mooring further distant than 500 yards and several within coo, whilst, with’comparatively short piers, many berths could be arranged for such ships to load and discharge cargo alongside railway jetties at all tides. 8. The above conclusions have been arrived at after much anxious consider ation on the spot and with the advantage of thorough discussion with a Naval Officer in whose hands lay the special survey with the sole object of furnishing the necessary data. The subject being of supreme importance and in view of our position in Koweit and what the future may hold for us in regard to the Baghdad Railway, I have ventured to express my views in some detail in the hope that the final decision as to location may be facilitated. My endeavour has been to suggest the best site for ou. selves, to leave no opportunity fora Foreign Power and at the same time to keep in view economy of present and future possible construction.[Confidential.'] P-2.

I have the honour to forward tracing carried out by officers of “ Lapwing ” for the information of Political officers during recent visits to Koweit. In accordance with your directions the position of the Sheikh’s coal store was fixed by triangulation and is shown on tracing. 2. A site was selected for proposed government coal store and is shown on tracing about 159 yards north-east of Sheikh’s coal-shed. The actual position has been marked by two broad arrows cut in two rocks on the foreshore of the position selected. A section of foreshore through Y opposite this spot is shown on tracing. With reference to my instructions to determine the nature of the bottom to a depth of 20 feet at L.W.S. off the foreshore of Bunder Shweikh I found that Captain Shakespear only desired an 18 foot contour line and such infor mation as could be obtained by a cursory examination. The general nature of the foreshore and bottom have been inserted on tracing. A rough survey was supplied to Captain Shakespear who expressed him self satisfied with the information contained in it. The foreshore of Bunder Shweikh is generally sandy with no sign of coral outcropping except where it is shown on tracing. I should say that coral would be found at varying depths all over the sandy plain and foreshore in the vicinity of the Sheikh’s coal store.The reef shown on the tracing opposite the Sheikh’s coal store is not really a reef but simply coral laid bare by the action of the tide and slopes down to the water just the same as the sandy beach. I have, etc., (Sd.) C. K. MACLEAN, Lieutenant and Commander, The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division. [Demi-Official.] Dated 14th August 1907. From—The Political Agent, Koweit, To—The First Assistant in charge current duties, Dushire. Turn that Bunder Shweikh negotiations are taking is better than I expect ed. Sheikh Mubarak has taken the pearl out of the oyster for himself by reserving the coal house recently erected with surrounding compound 150 yards square, coal house occupying the centre of the north-west or seaside. Apart from that reservation he grants us rectangular pbt of ground 3,750 yards by 300 yards at a perpetual rent of Rs. 60,000 per annum paid in advance. The north-west boundary 3,750 yards long in a direct line and roughly parallel to foreshore but must contain coal house or compound. Subject to these two conditions, position is at our option. Rent gives right without further demand to all foreshore to depth of 3 fathoms at lowest springtide between north-east and south-west boundaries produced to north-west except immediately in front of Mubarak’s reservation and full liberty to erect buildings of any kind, to sublet to British, British Indian and Koweit subjects, to put down buoys and carry out all works necessary to ease passage of steamers from open sea to harbour Shweikh. As area of land now granted is more than 12 times that originally asked for, rent is proportionally one-third of Cox limit, and I strongly recommend l should be empowered to accept at once without further question. Koweit subjects right of pre-emption or prior lease is stronger than ours to the land surrounding present concession to distance of 1,000 yards from any point cf our boundary but otherwise Government has precedence over all comers with regard to such land. Government has absolute right of pre-emption or prior lease to entire island of Shweikh and its foreshore (also called on chart, Karaim). Government had absolute right of pre emption or prior lease to Ras Kathama and foreshore to limit of two nautical miles in any direction but Sheikh reserves to himself la id for house within boundaries of total linear length of 600 (six hundred) yards somewhere at his option near Ras Kathama but will grant a right of way to sea to Government 15 feet broad, if such is found necessary. Kathama land can only be leased. Concession also contains clause dictated by Sheikh asserting spirited dec laration of independence and Sheikh Mubarak’s determination not to part with his rights in land to any Foreign Government including Turkey or to their subjects without consent of British Government asked for and granted. Agreement is terminable at option of^ British Government only. Sheikh Mubarak also binds his heirs but his signature only holds good for two months. If w r ithin that period, Government consents, Agreement is binding. If not, new terms can be arrranged. P'S' —Pl an enclosed gives rough idea of concession but north-w T est line may shift to right or left and it will perhaps be better to bring it to the left a bit. S. G. KNOX.[Demi-Official].

Latest reports just before closing the mail, Moola Abdulla took the amended agreement up to the Sheikh by request and read over and over to him with a map of the same kind as I send you now which I prepared tor him. He made a few verbal alterations. The land in Kathama could only be hired at a rent that would satisfy the Sheikh, the Sheikh’s house compound at Kathama would be enclosed by 600 yards instead of 500 yards and a curious interpola tion, the 150 yards north-west boundary of Sheikh Mubarak’s reservation is to be exclusive of the coal house dimensions. I boggled at this a bit as it upsets the symmetry of the plan but 1 don’t see that it really affects the concession. ***•**»» Suggested Revised Version of Translation of the Second Clause of the First Con dition of the Bunder Shweihh Agreement.

It is ^ considered that the location of the concession should he such that the Sheikh’s coal shed would be exactly in the middle of the frontage. The site proposed is indicated by the rectangle ruled in pencil on the largest of the enclosed tracings. 3. This position, opposite Bunder Shweikh anchorage, is, however, miles from the anchorage for large ships in Koweit Harbour. Bunder Shweikh anchorage is narrow and confined, and capable of accommodating at one time only three ships of the Proserpine class and three gun-boats. 4. Springs rise 10 to 11 feet, neaps 7 to 9 feet, so that a ship of the Vroser- pine class should be able to enter at high water on any day, but it would be advisable to erect a tide pole, so that the depth of the channel could be signalled to incoming vessels, and to lay down moorings for three vessels of the Proser pine class. 5.

With reference to Karine Department letter Do. 1360-M. of the 21st October 1909, on the subject of the establishment of a coal depot at Koweit, be pleased to lay the following remarks before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council 2. It is considered that the location of the con cession should be such that the Sheikh’s coal shed would be exactly in the middle of the frontage. 2he site pro posed is indicated by the rectangle ruled in pencil on the largest of the enclosed tracings. 3. This position, opposite Bunder Shweikh anchorage, is, however, 4&amp; miles from the anchorage for large ships in Koweit Harbour. Bunder Shweikh anchorage is narrow and confined, and capable of accommodating at one time only three ships of the ^PHCSIBPIHE” class and three gun boats • 4. Springs rise 10 to 11 feet, neaps 7 to 9 feet, so that a ship of the 'PROSERPINE' class should be able to enter at high water on any day, but it would be advisableto erect a tide pole, so that the depth of the channel could be signalled to incoming vessels, and to la^ down moorings for three vessels of the class. 5. Midway between the outer anchorage (koweit Harbour) and the inner anchorage (Bunder Shweikh), the channel, carrying not less than 12 feet at L.W.O.S., narrows to one cable for a distance of 400 yards, and then opens out again. It would be necessary to buoy the mouth of this funnel and to erect leading narke. 6. The tracings enclosed in the letter under reply are returned herewith as requested.

N ' From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To S. H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Foreign Department letter o. 1210-E.A., dated 24th July 1909, forwarding a copy of a leiter from the Secretary to the Government of Bombay in the Public Works Department, on the subject of the projected coal depdt at Koweit. 2. It will be understood that it was inconvenient that the somewhat difficult questions of, firstly, the delimitation of the precise limits of our Concession and, secondly, the selection of the most convenient point within it for the location of a coal depot, should be gone into on the spot just as a change of Political Agents was imminent. Hence Major Knox’s reply to the late Assistant Engineer Mr. Laffere. As soon, however, as Captain Shakespear had settled down, the matter was taken up and the Senior Naval Officer was requested to be good enough to depute one of His Majesty’s Ships, when a convenient opportunity offered, to (1) Political Agent, Koweit,to Resident, No 414, make a survey of the foreshore of Bunder to Resident, No. P.-2, Shweikh iii consultation with the Political dated sth August 1909, with enclosure and sur/ey Agent. H.M.S. “Lapwing,” Lieutenant- pan Commander MacLean, was in due course deputed for the work, and I am now able to submit the results in the form of the communications and accompaniments marginally-cited. 3. The position to start with is briefly this. Our Concession must contain the Sheikh's which must contain the Sheikh’s coal-shed, which was already built, on precisely what proves to be the most desirable spot on the whole foreshore, before the negotiations commenced. Our selection of ground, therefore, must be within certain preliminary limits, determined by the position of the Sheikh’s shed. Within these limits there seems to be no practical doubt as to which will be the most convenient spot for our coal depot. I he selection of the best site of our Concession, however, is obviously a problem of great moment, and I have no doubt the Government of India will decide to refer the question with the H.M.S. “ Lapwing’s ” survey, to His Majesty's Government for decision under the advice of the Admiralty. 4. It was found by the Political Agent and Lieutenant-Commander MacLean in the course of the present operations that the English text of the Second Clause of the first condition of the agreement, as rendered by Major Knox in the translation forwarded with his letter No. 551, dated 16th October 1907, was / ( incapable of practical interpretation on the ground, and on reference to the V. vernacular original and to certain demi-official explanations written to the Residency by Major Knox while the negotiations were in progress, it became (.) Demiofficial comm.nic.tio,, f,om Political evident to me that his translation needed Agent, Koweit, to First Assistant Resident, dated amendment. It is on the amended version, , 1 o) A DSoS| Wi L h ,.

MacLean, and my present observa tions, are based. I beg that the said revised version, including the punctuation, may be closely examined, and if it is held to be correct, it may replace the previous translation on the record. 5. If I may be pardoned for making a simple suggestion. In order to realise readily on the survey plan the limits of our sphere of selection, it is convenient to cut out of the centre of a piece of card a rectangle showing the size of our Concession, drawn to the scale of the Survey; then one can see the limits of the field of choice for the location of our Concession compatible with the retention of the Sheikh’s enclave in or on its seaward face. I say on, because it will be remembered that everything to seaward between the prolonga tion of the side boundaries, up to the 3 fathom line, goes with the Concession. T Sent separately.2 6. Assuming, as I believe to be the case, that the views of the two officers concerned as to the best site for the coal dep6t, as contained in their present reports, are based on a correct interpretation of the Agreement, 1 see no reason to differ from them, and therefore, if opportunity offers, I think no harm will be done, while time will be saved, if the Assistant Engineer makes his preliminary ^ estimates; on the provisional supposition that the site now recommended is the one which will ultimately be decided upon. In the meanwhile, I beg that the larger question may be subjected to expert examination as soon as practicable. No. 414 , dated Koweit, the 28th July 1909. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence regarding the location of a coal-depot at this port ending with this office letter No. 39, dated the 22nd January 1908. 2. The arrival of a launch for this Agency having made the matter of sto rage of coal for her use one of some urgent necessity, I have the honour to ad dress you on the two much more important subjects upon which this matter will, depend for settlement, vis., the exact situation of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore concession leased from Sheikh Mubarak in October 1907, and the institution and location of a properly equipped coal depot. 3. A reference to the lease Agreement forwarded with my predecessor’s letter No. 551, dated the 16th October 1^07, shows that the British Government has the option of so severing its ground that a rectangle 7,500 cubits by 600 cubits ^ 3 , 75 ° yards by 300 yards) may be taken up anywhere along the Bunder Shweikh foreshore with the following reservations :— (a) That the long seaward boundary of the rectangle shall lie through the existing coal-shed belonging to the Sheikh. (£) That this long side shall also correspond with “ the sea-line ” (pre sumably high water mark, as far as is consistent with its being a perfectly straight line. (c) That the rectangle shall extend only 600 cubits (300 yards) in depth from this line for the landward boundary. (d) That in the rectangle on the seaward side there shall be an enclave a square of 300 cubits (150 yards) side, the property of the Sheikh. (e) That in thte square shall be situated the Sheikh existing coal-shed, though the actual area of the coal-shed is excluded from that of the square. The British Government is further entitled to all ground above or below water contained between the prolongations of the two short (east and west) sides of the rectangle as far as the three-fathom line at low water springs, excluding that portion contained between the prolongations of the east and west sides of the Sheikh’s enclave. The British Government has also the right to lay buoys and navigation marks anywhere in Koweit territory and to build jetties, coal- sheds, etc , within the limits defined above. 4. To obtain full advantage of this Concession, I presume as fundamental that that portion of the harbour should be secured which will give the maximum area of deep water necessary for a good anchorage near enough to the shore to enable possible piers and wharf-walls to be constructed without abnormal expen diture owing to distance and heavy work. 5 . From a reference to the plan supplied by H.M.S. &lt;f Lapw ing’s” recent surveys, it will be seen that the Sheikh’s existing coal-shed occupies the best possible site along the whole foreshore, the three and four-fathom lines being3 only 100 and 150 yards distant respectively from the high-water mark, within a few feet of which the shed stands. On both sides of the Sheikh’s coal-shed, the three-fathom line gradually draws further and further away from high-water mark until, at a point 1,600 yards east of the Sheikh’s shed, it is 400 yards from high- /#•* water mark and, taking a sharp bend to the north, narrows the deep-water chan- \ nel and gives a large area of the haroour rear the town only 2 fathoms or less water. On the westward the same gradual receding takes place for 1,100 yards from the Sheikh’s shed, and the three-fathom line is then 300 yards distant from high-water mark; for the next 1,000 yards to the west there is slightly less water with the three-fathom line averaging about 500 yards^ distant from high-water mark ; further west still, the deep-water (i.e„ anything more than three-fathoms) again narrows and the end of the harbour is reached. Along nearly the whole length of the foreshore, the bottom appears to be solid dead coral rock with mud and sand covering it in varying shallow depths, whilst in places it appears bare as a reef. All along the shore, therefore, good solid foundations will be found for either masonry or pile-work. 6 . I attach a tracing of a section prepared by H M.S. “ Lapwing” on a line passing through a spot 159 yards north by 48 east from the Sheikh’s coal- shed, which gives a very good idea of the fall for some 1,000 yards of the shore line. Commander MacLean of H. M. S. “ Lapwing ” and I went thoroughly over and discussed all the ground, and both agreed in the conclusion that the best site for any proposed coal-sheds was undoubtedly as close as possible to the Sheikh's shed on the eastward and the spot through which the section attach ed hereto passes \a as selected so as to give a clear 150 yards for the Sheikh’s enclave] between this spot and the Sheikh’s shed the section improves by becom ing steeper, whilst it deteriorates further eastward by becoming less steep. An alternative site presented itself at about the same distance to the west of the Sheikh’s shed, but we found that a large area above the actual high-water mark, as shown on the chart, is liable to flooding at springtides, and this fact would necessitate the construction of a long seawall, some 1,800 yards at least, with high plinths and much filling work behind it, to allow of buildings remaining sufficiently dry ; moreover the section was hardly as steep from high-water mark to the three-fathom line. 7. I trust that the above paragraph will give sufficiently clearly the best site for any buildings or coal depdt now proposed. We can now turn to a corsider- ation of the rest of the area. From the details given in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above, I am of opinion—and I think I have Commander MacLean’s support from a seaman’s point of view—that the best site for our rectangular Concession will be with the seaward (north-west) boundary line running about north 64 east and south 64 west through the northernmost corner of the Sheikh’s coal-shed with some 1,600 yards to the eastward and 2,15^ yards to the westward of that shed. My reasons for this suggestion are the following:— (a) Commencing from the easternmost point, we shall have our frontage (including the Sheikh’s enclave) for nearly 1,600 yards practically on the high-water mark ; buildings, piers, etc., can be conveniently erected along the whole of this frontage economically as necessity arises, without any ex:ra expenditure for seawalls, etc. (b) The next 1,800 yards is made up of three portions, along the whole front of which a heavy seawall or wharf will be required if the perfectly straight line is to be preserved and the overflow at high spring tides is to be kept out of the Concession. The first portion, 600 yards, varies from high-water mark down o the two fathom line : the second 550 yards, from the two-fathom line down to three fathoms and up again to two ; the third 650 yards from the two-fathom line up to high-water mark again. (c) The last 350 yards is all above high-water mark on comparatively high ground with a small area of dry ground to the front (north west side). Portion (a) will meet all our possible requirements unless a vast change takes place in the importance of Koweit as a port, such as would result from its4 becoming the terminus of the Baghdad Railway. In the event of this change taking place general, financial and political considerations would at once make it worth while proceeding with harbour works along portions (b) and (c). In the meantime, if my suggested location of the Concession meets with approval, we hold practically all the available moorings for any ship drawing 20 feet or more ^ with no single mooring further distant than 500 yards and several within ^00, ^ whilst, with comparatively short piers, many berths could be arranged for such ships to load and discharge cargo alongside railway jetties at all tides. 8. The above conclusions have been arrived at after much anxious consider ation on the spot and with the advantage of thorough discussion with a Naval Officer in whose hands lay the special survey with the sole object of furnishing the necessary data. The subject being of supreme importance and in view of our position in Koweit and what the future may hold for us in regard to the Baghdad Railwav, I have ventured to express my views in some detail in the hope that the final decision as to location may be facilitated. My endeavour has been to suggest the best site for oui selves, to leave no opportunity for a foreign Power and at the same time to keep in view economy of present and future possible construction.[Confidential^ P-2.

In accordance with your directions the position of the Sheikh’s coal store was fixed by triangulation and is shown on tracing. 2. A site was selected for proposed government coal store and is shown on tracing about 159 yards north-east of Sheikh’s coal-shed. The actual position has been marked by two broad arrows cut in two rocks on the foreshore of the position selected. A section of foreshore through Y opposite this spot is shown on tracing. With reference to my instructions to determine the nature of the bottom to a depth of 20 feet at L.W.S. off the foreshore of Bunder Shweikh I found that Captain Shakespear only desired an 18 foot contour line and such infor mation as could be obtained by a cursory examination. The general nature of the foreshore and bottom have been inserted on tracing. A rough survey was supplied to Captain Shakespear who expressed him self satisfied with the information contained in it. The foreshore of Bunder Shweikh is generally sandy with no sign of coral outcropping except where it is shown on tracing. I should say that coral would be found at varying depths all over the sandy plain and foreshore in the vicinity of the Sheikh’s coal store.The reef shown on the tracing opposite the Sheikh’s coal store is not really a reef but simply coral laid bare by the action of the tide and slopes down to the water just the same as the sandy beach.

From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Sir Lons W. Dank, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to make a reference on the subject of the arrangements now existing for the coaling of the ships of ITis Majesty’s Navy and the Koyal Indian Marine in these wateis west of Karachi, and especially at Bush ire. 2 . The Government of India are no doubt aware that coal is obtainable at— (a) Maskat—Government Dep6t. (&amp;) Bushire—Government Depdt. (c) Bussorah—Dep6t of private British firm. As regards Maskat, I have no special observations to make. It is neces sary and important for us to have a coaling station there and the facilities ob tainable, subject to the limited resources of the port in regard to coolies arM lighters are considerable. 3. Near the entrance to the Persian Gulf we have no coal, Basidu having fallen into desuetude as a coalinnr depot for some 20 years past. It would no doubt prove very convenient to His Majesty’s ships which are, I believe, under standin' orders to call there on their wny up and down the Gulf if we had a store at Henjam but until the nature of our occupation is finally decided, it would be impolitic to take any action in regard to that Mand which might possibly introduce a fresh element of difficulty in our negociations with the Persian Government. 4. I now come to the case of Bushire. This dep6t is, like that at Maskat, maintained by the Marine Department of the Government of India. The Coal Hangars are rented and the handing of the coal is done under a contract arrangement with a local trader. The actual coaling work is carried on under circumstances of great difficulty. The harbour is very treacherous for many months of the year for native boats and except in the latter part of the hot weather, perhaps from July to November, wind is apt to get up very quick ly and it is impossible to rely on the calmness of the sea for two days together. Moreover, only the smaller ships can venture into the inner anchorage miles from the shore. The larger vessels such as His Majesty’s ships “ Hyacinth.” “ Proserpine,” “ Pox,” cannot enter and when they are driven to take coal have to do so from the outer anchorage 7 or 8 miles away. Another difficulty is that we have no direct control over coolies, boats, or boatmen, and owing to the vagaries of one and all and the difficulty of coaling ships at such long distances from the shore, the process is a most trying one tv»tli to those concerned with the ships at sea and with the coal on shore Ihe natural consequence is that vessels as a rule avoid coaling at Bushhe and Ihe depdt is chiefly used for the requirements of the B.I.M.8. “Lawrence;” and of the subsidised ships occasionally. 6 . Now the “ Lawrence ” and His Majesty’s three subsidised ships « Sphinx,” “ Lapwing ” and “ Redbreast,” can all coal without inconvenience and with mueh greater practical facility at Bussorah, where a store of coal is kept for sale to any vessel that may require it, by a local British merchant. It would seem therefore that if we only had to consider smaller ships in this part of the Gulf, their needs could he supplied entirely by the Bussorah Contrac tor, but in the absence of coal at Henjam it is no doubt necessery that we should have some coal in the north of the Gulf available in case of uigt m } loi ships of any ordinary draft. I have the honour in this connection to ask that the Government of India will be pleased to consider, in consultation with the IS aval Authorities, whether the coaling station at Bushire could not conveniently and usefully be dispensed with and replaced by one at Koweit, where the harbour is much more shelteredand convenient for large vessels and where the more frequent appearance of our ships which would result, would have a useful effect in other ways. I should mention thas even if the Government Depot at Bushire were done away with, there would almost invariably, as now, be a store of coal in the godowns of one of the British Shipping Agents as at Bussorah, and as far as the Lawrence is concerned it would be no more trouble for her to go to Koweit or Bussorah for coal than to go for water to the Shatt-el-Arab, which she has to do regularly in any case. Should it be considered necessary to maintain any fixed arrangement at Bushire, it might be held sufficient to enter into a contract with some local merchant in which he would undertake to have not less than 500 tons always available and to sell it to us at a fixed rate. a ai -T- reco to nise is a question which primarily concerns the Naval Authorities, but as a dep 6 t at Koweit seems politically and practically to have a good many advantages over one at Busbire, I have ventured to solicit consi- • see Progs.

(3) Major Knox’s letter No. 39, dated aand January, with one enclosure. subject. 2. Major Knox estimates the cost of building 3 godowns to held 3,600 tons of coal besmes allowmg an* space and room to work in, at Rs. 35,000, but he thinks that by a careful manipulation of the exchange between dollar and rupee and by importing for that purpose dollars from Bombay, much economy might be ettected. I have no comments to offer on the estimates which have been framed with the local knowledge of the rates of labour and prices of materials, and I think that they may be accepted unless the Government of India decide f o have them prepared by the Assistant Engineer Persian Gulf subdivision. 3. Next comes the question of coaling charges. These Major Knox puts down as follows in a subsequent communication— (a) for ships coaling off Bunder Shweikh @ Rs. 0-15-0 per ton. (£) for ships coaling in usual anchorage @ Rs. 1-14.0 per ton. These rates include weighing and bagging (cost of bags inclusive), putting into boats, boat-hire and stacking into bunkers on board the ship ; they do not however seem to take into account the wear and tear of the bags and the cost of mending and replacing those that have become unserviceable. I think therefore that Rs. 1-8-0 and Rs. 2-c-o per ton w r ould be about the correct rates for coaling in Bunder Shweikh and in the present anchorage, respectively. In Bushire we pay Rs. 2 per ton when coaling in the inner harbour and Rs. 2-4-0 per ton in the outer anchorage. 4. Then comes the question of Establishment Charges. Major Knox pro poses 2 watchmen as permanent establishment and thinks that the duties of tmdal and weighman can best be entrusted to the Indian crew of the Political Agent’s launch. I do not, however, consider that it would be feasible to utilise their services in coaling matters. I doubt whether the crew would be always available for coaling work, as they will have their own work in the launch to attend to, and it may not unfrequently happen that the launch is away when a ship has to be coaled. I think therefore that the Coal Depot should have its own separate perma nent establishment, consisting of a tindal and 2 weighmen. These men should be located at the Depot and act as watchmen as well. The rate of pay which may have to be allowed to secure good men may be roughly estimated as follows:— 1 Tindal @ Rs. 35 per mensem. 2 Watchmen @ Rs. 25 each per mensem. The total cost of establishing a Coal Dep6r at Koweit would thus be— Initial charges Rs. 35,000. Recurring Charges.-- Wages Petty repairs, etc. (say) ... Rs. 1,020 per annum. 80 »&gt;annum cost of the present Bushire Dep 6 t is as follows :— Rent of godowns i* » • ■ : Wages »» Rs. ... (i) 2 at Rs. 80 per mensem ... 960 ... ( 2 ) 5 at Krans 220 per mensem ... 812 ... ( 1 ) 1 Tindal at 20 per mensem ... ( 2 ) 2 Weighmen 12 each per mensem. = 44 per mensem • •• 528 per u per annum. Total ... 2,300 per annum. By the transfer of the Depdt to Koweit a saving of Rs. 1,200 per annum would be effected in recurring expenditure, and we should be left with the initial cost estimated for managingthe Dep 6 t, namely, Rs 35 , 000 . 5 . With regard to the construction of a jetti and a light tramway which have been suggested by Major Knox I fully concur with him that if these projects were carried out the coaling arrangements in Koweit would be placed on a very satisfactory footing, which would no doubt be welcomed by the Navy. The expediency or otherwise of incurring this expenditure now seems to depend upon the question of the degree of importance with which Koweit is likely to be invested in the near future. This question will no doubt receive due con sideration at the hands of Government. No. 127 , dated Bushire, the 7 th January 1908 . From— Captain A. P. Trevor,/ or Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Political Agent, Koweit. I have the honour to inform you that the Government of India have under consideration the question of abolishing the Government Coal Dep 6 t at Bushire (where as you are aware the conditions for coaling ships are extremely incon venient) and of creating one at Koweit instead. I am desired to report the initial and recurring expenditure in connection with the Dep 6 t at Bushire, and to give similar estimates of probable initial and recurring cost in case of Koweit. I attach a memorandum giving^ details regarding the Bushire Depdt, and request that you will put me in possession as far as possible of similar information and estimates for Koweit. Memorandum about Bushire Coal Depot' ( 1 ). On an average 3,000 tons are required per annum, but the quantity demanded annually is regulated on the basis of the average consumption of the three previous years, and the result arrived at is multiplied by 2 J so as to complete the supply for 2 J years which we are supposed to keep in stock.

We have the following buildings for storing coal in Bushire, viz. (a) a caravanserai containing 3 godowns of the dimensions given in the margin; (b) one godown large and 3 godowns small, dimen sions as per margin. No ventilators are required if properly covered coal-sheds are built after the fashion of the godowns at present in our occupation here. I am trying to have a sketch of them taken for the information of Major Knox. ( 3 ) . Our coal establishment here, which w’as only sanctioned in July 1906 , con sists as follows 1 Tindal on Rs. 20 =75 Krans. 2 Weighmen on Rs 12=45 Krans each, and I think the same strength will have to be engaged at Koweit.r 3 r; 1 would however observe that if a trustworthy man as a contractor for shipping and landing coal could be found in Koweit, who could also be entrusted with the custody of the coal under the supervision of the Political Agent’s Office, there would be no need for a Coal Establishment. Of course the Contractor will require liberal treatment in the matter of rates for shipping and landing coal. Here we pay Rs. 2 per ton for shipping coal in the inner anchorage and Rs. 2-4 per ton in the outer anchorage. The charges for shipping include labour for weighing and bagging the coal, putting it into lighters, conveying to the ship to be coaled, and putting and storing it on board The charges also include the cost of gunny bags. The charges for landing include lighterage from ship to shore and stacking the coal in the godowns. The Contractor here is supposed to have about 200 tons bagged and ready for immediate shipment. A regular contract will have to be drawn more or less on the lines indicated here. No. 39 , dated Koweit, 22 nd January 1908 (Confidential). From— MAJOR S. G. Knox. Political Agent, Koweit, . .

Allowing for air space and room to work in this does not seem excessive. The estimates are pitched rather high on purpose. Much economy might be effected by careful management of the dollar. A chest of $ 10.000 might be brought from Bombay. It will be noticed that 21 years rental at Bushire rates would pay cos t and repairs of a substantial structure like the above should be trifling. T he duties. tindal and weighmen could best be entrusted to the Indian crew of the Political Agent’s launch and their labour paid for by the iob at 4. annas per ton. r J i A couple of local watchmen would be required, and it would be necessary to pay them at high rates of pay, living at that distance from the town.

The cost of this is a matter for experts. Expert knowledge would also be able to say whether a light tramway, say 25 °iA ard l 0r \ g ^ aight from ^e coal-sheds to the sea, along which truck-loads could be shoved right up to the ship’s side, would not reduce the time and labour ot loading and unloading to a minimum.

'T [ r CONST AMTINOPLE, June 12th, 1905. % Lord:- I a y a glad to he able to report to Your Lord ship the satisfactory settlement of two questions which have been the subject of incessant representa tions both to the Porte and to the Sultan during the last few years. On the 6th instant I received information from the Sublime Porte that an Imperial Irade had been issued by the Sultan according to the British Khedivial Steamship Company the same coaling privi leges in Turkey as are enjoyed by the Mail Steamers of other nationalities and continuing to the British Indian and Anglo-Arabian Navigation Company at Basra similar privileges. It was open to me at any time to compromise these questions by agreeing to pay transit dues of on all coal consumed on the High Seas taken from Coal Depots in Turkey and I have no doubt the Com panies Marquess of Lansdowne, K.C # , &amp;C.j &amp;c.j &amp;c.Companies would have accepted this arrangement. I saw, however, very serious objection to agreeing to any kind of differential treatment in a matter of this sort and still more to allowing the Ottoman.Gov ernment to withdraw arbitrarily and at their will and pleasure a privilege enjoyed for so many years by the two British Persian Gulf and India line of steamers. In conveying his compliance with our request to the Porte the Sultan states that it has been decided to abolish all such privileges, but that pending the application of this general measure the exemption demanded by the British Embassy will be accorded. I do not think we need be disturbed as to the application of any general measure such as is con templated in the Sultan’s Irade. I have &amp;c.. (Signed) N.R.O*Conor.Secret Department.
