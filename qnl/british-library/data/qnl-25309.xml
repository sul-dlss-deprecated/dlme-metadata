Foreign Office and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. March 2nd, 1916 Sir:- (1) With reference to my letter of the 29th Immediate . Confidential, ultimo, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, Secretary Sir E. Grey considers it important that the assumption should he at once controverted that w the Company would, in any case, in the event of any change in the Middle East favourable to British interests occurring, he given complete oil rights over any portion of the Turkish Empire which may come under British influence’ 1 . (2) The D’Arcy group, as distinct from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, were interested in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The interests of that group never extended to certain portions of the Turkish Empire, such as the Parsan Archipelago, where His Majesty’s Government, before the war, were committed to support other British groups whose claims would in any case he entitled to careful, and probably to preferential, consideration. (3) But apart from these aspects of the question, and from that of whether the D’Arcy group is in fact entitled to a claim of monopoly in Mesopotamia in regard to oil rights, Sir E. Grey deems it essential that the whole attitude of His Majesty's The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(W.36846/16) M-j Majesty's Goveranent towards the oil question should be reviewed at an early date. (4) It Is understood that, leaving out of account the American supplies, which in the opinion of some experts may eventually be entirely absorbed by the anticipated increase in the American demands, the principal sources of supply are those controlled by the Royal-Dutch-Shell group. This group, by virtue of sundry agreements still having a currency of several years, possess the marketing rights in respect of various categories of oil produced by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Burmah Oil Company, who, to that important extent, are therefore not free agents. (b) In these circumstances, and having regard to the limited area of production of the two last named companies, and to the fact that one of them has proved unable to carry on without substantial Govern ment subsidies, it appears to Sir E. Grey desirable to examine whether the Royal-Dutch-Shell group cannot be brought under British control, by an amalgamation with the Burmah and Anglo-Persian Companies, or otherwise. The present moment appears to be opportune for such a development: the directors of the Shell Transport Company are, it is believed, favourable to some such scheme, and prepared to make sacrifices in order to enter into closer relations with His Majesty's Govern ment, even agreeing to some system for the regulation of prices; the directors of the Royal-Dutch Conpany are(W. 36846/16) are also, so Sir E. Grey is informed, not averse to adopt a like attitude. (6) The oil question has an important hearing upon considerations of foreign policy. The history of the Mesopotamian oil negotiations before the war afforded an example of the embarrassment which was caused to this Department in dealing with a company like the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, Limited, which, though British in domicile, is in fact controlled by the Royal Dutch Company. After the war, it will probably be essential, if an avenue is not to be afforded for German economic penetration in Egypt, in Mesopotamia, and elsewhere, that the handling of concessions for the supply and distribu tion of oil should be entrusted to a British group. Neither the Burmah Oil Company nor the Anglo-Persian Oil Company appear to dispose of the economic independence, the areas of supply, or the coronercial ability to enable them to fulfil the necessary conditions. (7) Sir E. Grey regards the present unsatisfac tory position as disquieting; and he would suggest that a committee, representing the several Departments concerned, should be formed by the Board of Trade to examine what are the desiderata which His Majesty's Government should aim at, with a view to definite action at an early date. He is persuaded that the question cannot safely be left open until after the war.—mm (W.36846/16) war.

Sir: We have the honour to refer to your letter No. 172576/15 dated 23rd November 1915 addressed to our Chairman. During the cold weather our geological staff has carried out an extensive reconnaissance over an area 100 miles inland from the Shat-el-Arab river lying between Koweit and Ur of the Chaldees, which reconnaissance shews that there are possibilities of finding Oil in the area surveyed. We are not putting in an application for the area in question because we understand that, in the altered circumstances referred to in your letter above quoted, . this Company would, in any case, in the event of any change in the Middle East favourable to British interests occurring, be given the complete Oil rights over any portion of the Turkish Empire which may come under British influence. As a guide to us in regard to our present and future procedure in connection with the exploration work which our Geological Staff is, at the request of the Admiralty, carrying on in these regions we shall be obliged if you will advise us if the above understanding of the position is correct.
