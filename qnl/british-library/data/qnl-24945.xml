Minute Paper, political Department. Please see previous submission on P.z,6683/32 on the Question of the desirability of formal intimation to the Persian Government that notification will he required by rulers of Arab Principalities before visits by ships of the new Persian Lavy to their ports. We urged in the b.-O.letter to the Foreign Office on that paper that such an intimation should be given by hr. Hoare (who had been reluctant to face the issue in the past) witnout aelay, ana our view was accepted by the Foreign Office and the necessary instructions were sent to hr. Hoare in their telegram No.115 of the 5th November, on P.Z.6762/ 32, which, while leaving the form.and manner of the comnunication to the Persian Government to his discretion, emphasised that early action appeared desirable. 2. From Colonel Fowle*s air mil letter now submitted it appears that the Minister aia, in fact, make a private communication to leyrnourtache just before the latter’s fall, but that he regards it as extremely doubtful whether its contents were passed on by the Minister of Court before his fall and is by no means anxious to revive the issue. On the other hand, there is a distinct risk, it appears, that the Persian Navy may visit the Arab coast, and the Resident in these circumstances urges that despite the danger of rousing - sleeping dogs the Minister should be asked to make a communication of the nature already approved to the Persian Government. 3 / 1212 5000 9.323. We do not, of course, want to provoke a controversy about Henjam or the like. On tne otner hand, the Persians on their side, so J-°ng -o the A.P.O.C. discussions are within the scope of League authority, appear to be equally anxious to avoid any incident. In any case, as we have secured formal requests from all the Arab rulers for notification prior io a, visit*, vvs should oo plucou in n embarrassing position if such a visit were made without notification simply because no steps hud. been taken hy us at Tehran. In all the circumstances the case for making a formal intimation to the Persian Government seems a strong one and I attach a letter to the Foreign Office supporting the Resident*s view. We may perhaps anticipate that it will fina general support from the Government of India, hut we need not I think, wait for their recommendation. ♦. / &lt;w C/ Vi/ cxA^\Draft Paper political Department Mm Under decretory of state, Foreign Office.

It may be inferred from Admiralty letter No. M 02989/32 of the 22nd November that the normal practice of independent rulers is to receive with all the usual courtesies a ceremonial call by the officers of a foreign warship even if the arrival of the warship has not been notified in advance. If, then, the Sheikh of Bahrein were to conform to this international practice and receive the officers of a Persiah warship in spite of their Government 1 s failure to give prior notification of visit, he could not reasonably be held by this mere tact to have taken a step which constituted an admission Persian suzerainty; and any assertion to the contrary y the Persian Government could presumably be safely ignor or convincingly refuted* 3. The Under Secretary of State, India Office.1 ( 4 ^) 3. It is clearly desirable that, in the event of its proving necessary to appeal to the League of Nations, the Sheikh of Bahrein shall be able to show that, regard less of minor affronts, he had behaved with consistent patience and moderation. It is also desirable that he should studiously refrain wherever possible from antagonis ing the Italian naval officers serving with the Persian fleet, upon whose tact and good will much must depend during the next few years. 4. For these reasons Sir John Simon considers that while the Political Agent should, as proposed, be given full discretion to advise the Sheikh in the light of the particular circumstances obtaining at the moment, he should nevertheless be informed that His Majesty’s Government would be opposed in principle to the action suggested by Colonel Fowle for contingency (c) except in abnormal conditions, such as a state of acute tension in Anglo-Persian relations, or some act of definite discourtesy towards the harbour officials on the part of the landing-party. 5. A tentative redraft of paragraph 3 of the telegram which it is proposed to address to the Government of India is enclosed herein for Sir Samuel Hoare’s consideration. 6 .

Departm ent. Please see previous submission on P.Z.6915/32 below. Before the letters approved on that paper had issued further telegrams received from the Government of India and the Political Resident, together with the letter of 22nd November, on P.Z.7086/32,from the admiralty and Mr. Hoare's despatch No. 463 of 4th November on P.Z.7091, necessitated revision of the proposed draft instructions. 2. The main point in issue now is the line to be taken in the event of the Persians wishing to pay a ceremonial call. Mr. Hoare is disposed to favour this on the grounds that it would be evidence 'of the recognition of the Sheikh as an independent ruler by tne Persian Government... in fact, the evidence would be so clear that I think the Persian Government would not be so foolish as to do anything of the sort”; and the Government of India are inclined to agree (telegram of 21st November). The Admiralty are doubtful enr te whether a ceremonial call should be refused on the first occasion and draw attention to the risk that we might expose ourselves to a charge of discourtesy not only from Persia but also from Italy, and to the fact that ’’foreign warships occasionally visit British ports in various parts of the world without giving the usual notice, but only a diplomatic protest is ever made and then only if the offence has been frequently repeated!’ Colonel Fowle (see his telegram of 24th November) is not convinced by tne Minister's arguments and would prefer that a ceremonial call should not be accepted/accepted unless prior notification oj. the visit has been given. 3 # The Department still thinks that a ceremonial call is not without danger - see paragraph 1 of the minute on P.Z.6915/32. But there is much force in the Admiralty arguments and on the whole the 'best thing seems to he to leave it to the discretion of the Political Agent whether or not to advise the receipt of such a call, if offered, in the light of the circumstances. (An immediate decision would oe necessary and there would prohahly hardly he time for | him to consult the Resident). Such a call would he followed up hy an immediate formal protest to Tehran | in the name of the Sheikh. A paragraph has been added to the telegram to cover the point. It is oft^C importance only in the case of Bahrein ana even there it is prohahly, as the Minister suggests, extremely unlikely that the Persians will run the risk of compromising themselves hy instructing any of their officers to take action on these lines. 4.

COPY SENT TO- -4?^ 2 9 NOV mi I am directed hy the Secretary of State for Inaia to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd November, No. M.02989/32, on the subject of thea, ction to be taken in the event of Persian warships visiting the States on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf without notification, and to refer to the W lUisl' Cti+j ^orre(noted in the rrargin on this subject the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare has carefully considered the situation as a whole in the light of the views expressed by the various authorities interested. No difficulty appears to arise as regards contingencies (a) and (b) discussed in para.3 of Colonel Fowle’s telegram No. 705 of 31st October. As regards contingency (c) as: that telegram, the point is^A£ not of very substantial Importance save in the case of Bahrein. In the case of the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf, if the Commander of a Persian warship expresses his desire to pay a ceremonial call, despite the/k the fact that prior notification has not been given of the arrival of his ship, the Secretary of State,in the light of the views expressed in para 2 of the admiralty letter of 22nd November, agrees that,such a call _ might he acceptec^v’^t-Tiough it wou 1 a&gt; he followed up hy formal ^ ^ ^ a runt**. representations at Tehran/. The position is different in the case of Bahrein. Sir Samuel Hoare appreciate ■I tf the force of the arguments adduced hy H.M* Minister,^sof the counter arguments suggested in Colonel Powle* telegram of 24th November. It is, perhaps, as the Minister suggests, very improbable that the Persians will risk compromising their- claim to Bahrein hy instructing or permitting an officer of their Navy to pay a ceremonial call on the Sheikh. But on the other hand the danger cannot oe overlooked that the opportunity of such a ceremonial visit, were the sheikh to accept it, might he taken oy the Persians to intirrate in a public manner, e.g. in the event of H.N. receiving the party in Durbar, that he was regarded a s a Persian suoject, whiler on. d-'-ryii, any action on their part which could oe construed as a formal recognition of the Sheikh’s independence would inevitably be disavowed by Persia. j On 7 0 . i■ Department On the whole, however, having regard to the considerations advanced by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State considers that the best course would be to leave to the discretion of the Political Agent, aA Bahrein, in the light of^the circumstances ,in which the Persian ship 'L pp-eyirsing t£i—malf-s—kite—e-alrl has arrived at Bahrein, the question whether or not i a ceremonial call, if offered, should be accepted. In the event of any | such call being' accepted and passing without incident, he would, however, propose firstly that the bheihh should be advised not to receive a further A /h\f ceremonial call without notice, and secondly that a formal notification should at once be made to the Persian Government in the name of the Sheikh that in future formal notice of such visits must be given. The Sheikh might in this connection take the opportunity to refer to his desire for notification’ in any remarks he might address to the representatives of the Persian ship. 4. As regards contingency (d), Sir 5. Hoare is in general agreement with the views of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. 5 # The draft telegram now enclosed embodies/embodies the instructions which, subject to the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir S. Hoare v/ould propose should be despatched to the Political Resident. I am to enquire whether Their Lordships concur in the draft in question or desire to suggest any modification in its terms. 6.

Your telegram dated 1/ it il Noveniber, S446 and Resident’s telegram of November, T/te/o? Persian Navy. 2. In event of visit without previous notification H.M.G. approve action suggested in contingencies (a) and (b) in paragraph 3 of Resident's telegram of 31st October, 705. 3. As regards contingency (c) Admiralty draw attention to the risk that refusal of call on first occasion might give grounds for charge of discourtesy and state that foreign warships occasionally visit British ports in various parts of the world without giving the usual notice. Moreover vessels calling in circumstances in contingency (b) might conceivably be anxious to pay bona fide ceremonial call. Call should therefore be permitted on first occasion save at Bahrein, but will be followed by formal protest h'vifou/' in name of ruler concerned’. In case A of Bahrein H.M.G. feel some apprehension lest Persians should use opportunity of ceremonial visito I publicly to intiwiate e.g. that Sheikh was regarded as Persian subject, while action by landing party which could be construed as formal recognition of Q&gt; his independence would of course inevitably be disavowed. In the light of Admiralty views and after considera* tion of problem as a whole His Majesty's Government consider that discretion as to advising receipt of ceremonial call should be left to ” Political- Agent in light of &amp;U { or i circumstances. In event of call being accepted and passing without incident immediate formal protest would be made to Tehran. / \ 4. As regards contingency (d) suggest that in event of Persians sending armed party to land at Bahrein the party should be met at pier by (preferably) European representative of Sheikh (e.g. Belgrave) by whom they should be informed on behalf of Sheikh that H.E. could not agree to party landing with arms but that no ;■ objection would be seen to their landing without arms for purpose of purchasing -provisions, etc. 5. If in light of communication of this nature, Persians were nevertheless to land with arms, question of employment of force would depend on their attitude and actual proceedings. 1 early they could not be allowed to behave in such a manner as to undermineDepartment .Si the authority of the Sheikh o\ our prestige in eyes of the population. But question whether and at what point P.A. should advise intervention of Bahrein police force must he left to his discretion if and when such a situation should arise. If interven tion did become necessary, our position would have been strengthened by' communication made to landing party at the commencement and onus of aggression would rest on the Persians. 6 . Risk of attempted armed landing is probably serious only at Bahrein, but similar action to that suggested above might also be taken in event of landing at Koweit or Muscat. As regards Trucial Coast we shall probably have to take our chance -i-n- o*m blngencicrr and protest immediately on behalf of Sheikhs affected. 7. Possibility of armed landing on Tamb, Abu Musa or other Arab islands cannot be overlooked but we obviously cannot immobilise sloops with object of preventing this* H.M.G. 'are ■ inclined^ to think*that risk must be faced. But immediate report should be sent in event of any action of this nature by Persian Navy with a view to necessary steps being taken at Tehran^ 8 . H.M.G. understand that Trucial flags are constantly flown at Tamb andAby Musa. It might be as well, if this can be done without attracting undu attention, to ensure so far as possible that on other inhabited islands belonging to or claimed by Arab rulers Trucial or other appropriate Arab flag is also kept flying.

My Lords feel some doubt whether in the event of a visit to Bahrein (or other Arab port) being made without notice, it would be desirable to refuse ceremonial calls on the first occasion. The position taken up by H.M, Government would not, in the opinion of My Lords, be prejudiced, provided they insisted that in future notice of visits must be made through them. If calls were refused, H.M. Government would be open to a charge of discourtesy not only from Persia but also from Italy, in view of the Italian officers on board. Foreign warships occasionally visit British ports in various parts of the } Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.W.l. worldt 1/ j. t ■ M. ,,k i world without giving the usual notice, hut only a diplomatic protest is ever made, and then only if the offence hss been frequently repeated. 3. The landing of an armed party to assert a claim to Bahrein would, as Colonel Fowle remarks, he a most serious step. My Lords consider, however, that the decision whether an attempt should or should not he made to arrest the party landed, hy force if necessary, can only he taken hy the local authorities on the spot, taking into consideration the forces available, particularly as to whether one of H.M. ships X is in the vicinity or not. Although an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the party would 4 he undesirable, My Lords consider it most important to avoid any action or inaction which might he misinterpreted as a tacit acceptance of Persia’s claim or of her right to assert her claim in this way. However, it is unlikely that the Persian G-overnment will take such a step. 4. Copies of this letter have been sent to Foreign Office and Colonial Office.

The Government of India in their telegram of 2nd November agreeathat the line proposed in that telegram was suitable in the contingencies described, ihe resident’s further telegram (15th November on P.Z.6915/32) speaks for itself. No difficulty arises as regards the action contemplated by the Resident in contingencies (a), (b) and (c) examined in his telegram of 31st October. Foreign Office suggested in conversation that in the event of the Persians wiidling to pay a ceremonial visit to the Sheikh we might possibly turn this to some advantage as constituting a recognition by Persia of his status. But I think the risks involved are very great* The Sheikh would certainly receive such a party in Durbar and the chances seem preponderantly to be that the Persians on arrival might inform him that they represented the Shah, his master, or otherwise create an incident the effects of which would be very unfortunate. In the event either of action by such a party leading to a serious incident or of the party so addressing the Sheikh as to make it possible to claim that they were recognising his sovereignty over Bahrein, they would certainly be disavowed by the Persians and we should be no farther forward. It seems safer, therefore, to act as suggested by the Resident. 2. The most difficult contingency for which to legislate is (d) in paragraph 3 of the Resident's telegram/ 1212 5 (,00 9.32I J telegrarii of 31st Qctoter. On tne whole the best course seems to be that suggested in the draft telegram now put up, ana Informal discussion with the Foreign Office suggests that they are likely to be prepared to accept it. We might take the opportunity to remind the Gulf authorities of the desirability of flying Trucial flags on the various islands clahne by or belonging to the x^rah rulers. 3. i submit that I might he authorised to seek Foreign Office and admiralty concurrence in the draft now attached. /i.Xf ?a. a y, c kDraft Paper. polit igal Department.

We have not yet received the views of the Government of India, hut it may perhaps he assumed that they will agree with the Resident as to the desirability of making a communication without further delay to the Persian Government as to the need for prior notification in the event of visits by vessels of the Persian Navy to the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf. But the Resident’s telegram also; raises a more difficult question - the action to be taken in the event of Persian aggression at Bahrein,- on which it is impossible to act in advance of their remarks. 2* We might, I think, immediately take up with the Foreign Office the narrow issue of a formal notification to Persia. The governing instructions on this point are the Foreign Office telegrams of 20th February 1932, Nos. 19, 20 and 21, on P.Z.1209/32, to Mr. Hoare. Those instructions were to the effect that it was desirable that an oral communication to the Persian Government regarding the new Navy should be made before its arrival in the Gulf and (while discretion as to the precise language to be used was left to the Minister) he was given fairly definite instructions as to what H.M.G. desired him to say. Those instructions, as will be seen, emphasised that he was to make it clear that prior notification to the Minister or to the Consul-General at Bushire would be desirable in the event of the Persian Government wishing to send a ship to visit any of the Arab ports or islands, 'so that any possibility of an awkward 1212 scco 9.32 incident might be avoided and time given for arrangements/arrangements to be made for the reception of the vessels with the customary courtesies'. Since the date of that telegram we have obtained from all the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf (with the possible Hr*- *■ ( * A exception of Item■ al- Qpiwain) letters intimating that they desire prior notification of visits by Persian ships. As the Resident points out in his present telegram the fact that such letters have been written at our instigation makes it of importance that such notification should in fact be given by Persian ships before visiting Arab ports. 3. It seems clear from Colonel Fowls's telegram that no action has yet been taken vis-a-vis the Persians. The Foreign Office are inclined to think that Mr. Hoare has held his hand because of the developments in the negotiations and that now that the point has again been brought to his attention by the Resident he will probably take steps to warn the Persian Government on the lines already approved ought, I think, at once to ask the Foreign Office to take it up formally with the Minister. I might perhaps be authorised to do : 'so demi-officially as in the draft to Mr. Rendel attached. once he has sent in his note about Henjam. However this may be, action has been left very ■-late and we considered for the moment.Draft Paper. Department. DRAFT LETTKR. G.W. RGntlslf Rsq.) G.M.G., Foreign Office. My dear George, Would you kindly look at the telegram from the Political Resident, of which I now enclose a copy (and copies of which have already been sent officially to you and the Admiralty under our printed letter No. P.Z.6628/32 of 2nd T by AIR M AlL 1063 4000 7.32 NovemlDer) about the arrangements in connection with visits by the Persian Navy to the Arab principalities of the Gulf. 2. The telegram really raises two issues, the first that of the desirability of making an immediate j communication to the Persian Government as to the need for I notification in such cases; the second the more difficult question of the line to be taken in the event of any Persian aggression at Bahrein or elsewhere. 3. We have not yet received the Government of India’s comments. But we think it possible to deal at once with the relatively narrow issue of notification, leaving the major question for examination subsequently in the light of what they may say. As regards notif icat ion/notification the governing instructions are those sent to Hoare in Foreign Office telegrams Nos. 19, 20 and 21 of 20th February 1932, in which the Minister was informed that it was desirable that an oral communication should be made to the Persian Government regarding the new Navy before its arrival in the Gulf and suggesting the line that oral communication might take. It seems clear;from Fowle*s present telegram that no communication has yet been made to the Persian Government. No doubt Hoare, for various reasons, has thought the moment inopportune to take action. But now that the Navy has actually arrived we feel here, and we trust you will agree, that it is desirable to say something to the Persians officially without delay, and if you see no objection we should be very grateful if instructions to this effect could be sent to Hoare. 4. We will write to you separately once we get tiie Government of India’s views on the other points arising out of the riesidant's telegram. 5. I am sending copies of this letter to the Admiralty and the Colonial Office. »ated | Mary £ it to f plats b peiraji r po Kp ptejaa Went -it. » - , Q.

The Admiralty will consider this further. But the question of precedence is not an easy one. The Commander of the Squadron may have some special rank in the Persian Navy, e.g. Admiral, or the like, and the point is one of active importance, because it will govern the delicate question of who is to pay the first call.

Recreational facilities could be afforded to ships of the Persian Navy by allocating Football, Cricket and Hockey Grounds to them on certain days.

The question of the honorary membership of the Officers* Club or the use of the Petty Officers* and Men’s Canteens by Persian Officers and men does not for the moment arise under the condition laid down by the Persian authorities when granting the privilege of importing liquors free of duty. This condition stated that the Club and Canteens should be used exclusively by officers and men of British Warships, no other person of any nationality is allowed to enter them.^ This is a question which I consider should not be raised until after the first visit of a Persian man-of-war to Henjam.Confidential 1 British ^sidency &lt;* Consulate-Cfener.

I have the honour to sa^ that the Governor of the £»ulf Porta dined here last nitjht and after dinner I had a long talk with His Excellency. I never quite know nowadays whether discussions with local officials are worth report ing or not in view of the fact that the administration is qq highly central ised and that local officials wield very little influence at Tehran and often have very little knowledge of what is going on. However, Agha Taliqani its a good stamp of official, sensible, quiet and helpful and usually seems to Know more or less what he is tal ing about, and it is after all tetter to report too much than too little. 1 have therefore thought it desiraisle to report briefly our conversation. ■Excellency had any definite information regarding the Persian Navy, and began by asking him ntfien the ships were expected. He said he had no definite information but had been told that they would be here about Hauro* i.e.Slst March, but he fully anticipated that their arrival would be delayed! they had, after all, untrained crews and acme delay almost invaria ly occurred in fitting out new ships 1 was anxious to ascertain whs tbs r His 3 His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, British negation, X ear an •3* m SJ** He want on to say that he thought the motor atrol boats . ould be exceedingly useful for suppressing smuggling and for carrying Road Guards and anlorc.ng law and order along the coast, but that the only real solution was a motor road from mshlre down to Bandar Abbas. I expressed the view that actually very little smuggling went on at the present time. His Excellency agreed and said that after all the acid teat was the prices current for such articles as sugar in the small ports along the coast and at Jushire. The price of sugar at i ushire at the present time was 15 lerans a batman, while the price at Bahrain was 3 lerans. tiugar could therefore be aula on the coast at about 3 krana a batman, and in the interior at about 8 or 9 krans, and when smuggling rife 111886 were the sort of prices that prevailed. actually, however, at the present time tne price of sugar at the smll ports along the coast was 13 krans and at this price it could not be profitably transported and sold into the interior, and this , figure was nowadays conclusive proof that no smuggling on a large scale was going on. Hie ..xcellency went on to say' that a certain amount of piece-goods were being smuggled across and that it was inevitable with a long sea-coast that some smuggling sh uld take place, and cited the analogy oi America, but went on by saying that he thought at present ( it was on a small scale and the presence of the four “ otor patrol boats would for all practical purposes put a stop to it. I may mention that His Kxcellency’s statements are confirmed by reports that 1 have received in Bahrain, to the effect that there is not nowadays a great deal of smuggling going e s ♦going on* 4 , x then asked Hie ixaai e&gt;&lt;o&gt; xtiat the i'eraian 0 ot efnnent proponed to do eith the two eioopa* and wnei e they proposed to station then* 1 ® said ..V.at h® tho *?* Ht they would be of eery little pr&amp;otical utility and did not dieguisa his opinion that he regarded them ae a useless extravagance ae they did not eonetitute an araed force of any practical value, he stated that it was the intention of the Persian lovernnent, in the first instance, to etation the ships at fua-ure, but subeequently they would Be based on aandar Sfaahpur when that port had been constructed, he further ave me to understand very definitely that, in his opinion, these nhlpe would very seldom do any practical work, iie said that he eupposed that if His 'iajeaty the -Jhah paid a vieit to the Gulf, they would convey or escort Hie ajealy, and doubtless would occasionally oe employed to carry the Governor oi tile Gulf - orts aa the 'yersepeiis” had done in the past, but Vie seemed rather to imply that he thought they would in all probability in due course share the fate of the -lersepolis' and •Kuaaffar'* the former is at present an oapty hulk upon the beach and the latter lies upon As side in Bushire harbour.

This caused some misunderstanding with the Government of Inc.ia ana witn ourselves, and Colonel Biscoe has now produced the missing paragraphs. The only real addition to the discussion is the missing paragraph 4, in which Colonel Biscoe opines that as the ships will arrive at the beginning of the summer (it is not quite clear on what grounds he thinks they will arrive at the beginning.of the summer rather than m the spring, which is our information), they will spend the first few months in acclimatising themselves and installing themselves on shore ( viz .. on the Persian coast). Beibr any likelihood arises of their proceeding to the Arab coast, Colonel Biscoe thinks that he will meet the Italian officers and could then ascertain their intentions before giving his final advice. This is an additional argument for delay in raising the matter at Tehran, but it does not seern to be sufficient to necessitate any alteration of the view which we have communicated to the Foreign Office. There is bound to be a certain element of danger in waiting for a problematic meeting between Colonel Biscoe and the Italian officers, and in any case it would 'savour of intrigue' in the same way as the communication already made to the Italian Government. If Mr. Hoare feels that he can do it with confidence, it is obviously better to go straight to the Persians than to carry on what must be more or less of an /I intrigue/intrigue ?. r ith the Italian officers. He have already suggested to the Foreign Office that ^ide discretion should be given to Tr. Roare, who wil be getting a copy of Colonel Biscoe’s telegram by post ’ shortly. If he has any qualms about approaching the Persians, he has discretion not to do so: if he has no qualms, one may be fairly confident that no ham at least would be done by his approaching them. B.

The memorandum mentions Arab A Rulers by name and states that H.M.G. are under obligations to these Rulers to conduct their relations with all foreign Governments; consequently any Persian aggression could not be a matter of indifference to H.M.G. In acknowledging • the memorandum, the Italian Government ask for information about the treaty being negotiated between Great Britain and Persia, and ask that, as they have no information | about particular agreements existing between H.L1.G. and the Arab Rulers, they may be furnished in confidence with thej texts of these agreements. 7/e may agree with the proposal in paragraph 3 | of the Foreign Office letter to promise the Italian Government the text of any treaty which we may conclude with Persia. 7/e may also agree that it is desirable to return as cordial a reply as possible to the Italians, and that there is no objection to communicating the texts of the Arab treaties to them.

As the memorandum given to the Italian Government only mentions the conduct of foreign relations by H.M.G., it would seem sufficient to communicate to the Italian Government the Trucial Exclusive Agreement* of 1892; the Koweit Agreement of 1899; the Bahrein Agreement of 1892; the El Katr V ftasi £ /J, Treaty of 1916 and the Fuscat Treaty of 1891.

Signor Grandi might also be informed that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements which have been concluded, but on the custom, consent and long established relationship of the Persian Gulf Chiefs and the Sultan of Fuscat with the Government of India.

In dealing with this question, which has become unnecessarily complicated, it may be of use to recapitulate very briefly its past history. The Persian navy will consist of two gunboats of 950 tons and four patrol vessels of 330 tons. The patrol vessels will^be used mainly for anti-smuggling duty on the Persian side of the Gulf. The two gunboat are obviously bigger than is necessary for that purpo and are probably being built merely for the purpose of 'showing the flag'. It seems most unlikely that they will remain on the Persian side of the Gulf. The various troubles ■which may arise from the arrival oi the Persian navy are:- (a) They may seize Arab rulers’ dhows on the pretext of ant i-smuggling or anti-arms traffic action. * It is not suggested that we can do anything about this unless and until an actual case arises in which it is claimed that an Arab dhow has been illegally seized by a Persian warship. (b) The Persian warships may visit Hen jam anu Basidu and cause unpleasantness at these two British naval bases, but as both Hen jam and Basidu are acknowledged in fact to be Persian territory, we are not in a position to object to Persian ships going there. The only thing will be to put a good face on it and try and avoid friction between the Persian V and British crev/s. (c) The Persian ships may make a sudden attack c one of the disputed islands, e.g., Tamb or Abu Musa, v/hich are the property of the Sheikh oi Shargah/ xv U5p 3000 10 31(2)/ Ml ' Shargah but are claimed by the Persians, and seize it before we are able to protect it. fay v (d) They may cruise in Arab waters, visit Arab ports without notice, and thus strengthen the claim whijh Persia makes from time to time to the possession of the Trucial Coast and even Muscat. (e) They may visit Bahrein on the ground that it is Persian territory, and cause an incident theie. (As a matter of fact, Colonel Biscoe thinks this very unlikely.) The last three possibilities are those whicr have really exercised the minds of the Imperial Departmen concerned, the Minister, Tehran, the Government of India and the Resident for the last six months. The history is briefly as follows:- (1) On 20th July, 1931, an interdepartmental conference was held at Colonel Biscoe’s instance (he being on leave), at which Colonel Biscoe said that in his view it would be extremely undesirable to allow Persian vessels to visit the ports of the various Arab Sheikhs without permission. As the Admiralty feared reprisals in respect of our ships visiting Persian ports if permission were insisted upon, it was agreed that notification of Persian visits to Arab ports would be sufficient. On the other hand, the political difficulties of approaching the Persians at that time, when relations were bad, the danger of Persian reprisal at Hen jam and the difficulties in respect of the position of Bahrein, caused the conference to decide that no action could profitably be taken at that time, and that there was nothing to be done but wait and see. fU* A. pz..Minute Paper.

P.Z.6105/31. 415b 3000 10 31 (2) At about the ssune time, however, on July 23rd Mr. Dodd, Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, sent a despatch to the Foreign Office suggesting that a y fonml warning should be given to the Persians of the terms on which Persian warships should be allowed to visit Arab waters -(if they were to be allowed to visit them at alj). He suggested that a copy of this communication should be sent to the League of Nations. The Foreign Office turned down this proposal as being unnecessary, liable to give rise to hostile reaction and Persian reprisals, and incapable of being effectively enforced. Instead, the Foreign Office, in their letter of 9th September, suggested that as an alternative a communication should be made to the Italian Government, as Italian officers .would in the first place be in command of the Persian ships (there are to be 15 Italian oxficers in the first instance), informing them of the special relations between H.M.G. and the Arab rulers / and the various points m dispute between H.M.G. and the Persian Government. This communication was finally conveyed to the Italian Government at the beginning of December. (j« (3) In Colonel Biscoe ! s absence Major Fowfe, Acting Resident, wrote to the Government of India on 7th September referring to the interdepartmental conference and urging that the'wait and see policy should not be continued, but that a communication should be made to the Persian Government before the ships arrived and the danger of an incident became/became acute. Paragraph 4 of this letter is flaggeo. and should be read. His main contention was that if we left the matter until an actual incident occurred, we should only be landed in serious difficulties. If the Persian ships must S o on the Arab side, let them go » on their lawful occasions', after agreement with (4) The Government of India wrote on 5th October agreeing generally with the Acting Resident, and suggesting that the Arab rulers mentioned m Article 1 of the draft Treaty,^flaggedj should be informed of the possibility that Persian ships of war may shortly appear in the Gulf, and should be asked to request us to infom the Persians that they did not wish Persian ships to visit their ports except with previous permission, application for which should be made through H.M.G. (5) On 17th November the Foreign Office reviewed the whole position in a letter to the India Office which gives the arguments on both sides. The Foreign Office were unable to make up their minds, though they suggested that in any case notification rather than permission should be required before visits of Persian ships. (6) Msanwhile, Colonel Biscoe, writing demi- officially on 29th October, made a new suggestion, liz., that we should wait until a ship turned up in an Arab port unannounced. She would then be given the usual courtesies and visits would be exchanged with the Sheikh. As soon as the visit was over, the Persian Government should be informed that the Sheikh would prefer in future that notification should be' sent to him/ P.Z.6562/31.

If the Persians refused this request, no courtesies or facilities for the crews to land would be given if the visit were repeated. (7) In a letter of 27th November, the Admiralty suggested that any demand for notification should be conveyed quite informally to the Persian Government. They seemed to be generally doubtful of the desirability of attempting to secure any general agreement with the Persians as to what their navy is to do or not to do in the Gulf. (8) The whole question was put to the Government of India in dated 1st December, suggesting that the Arab rulers should ask us to inform the Persian Government on their behalf that they would expect formal notification before any visit, and that a communication should then be made to the Persian Government, formally or informally, as the Foreign Office prefer. (9) Mr. Hoare, who had since taken over from Mr. Dodd at Tehran, wrote to the Foreign Office on December 2nd, bringing a fresh mind to bear on the whole problem. He c^si^ ^tha^we wej too timid with the Persians and that *£ wu Lpdre quite frankly to them tre ohonld prnbahly grt wh,lt w0 wi:ilirit ' M - In any case, the communication to the Italians would savour of intrigue if a similar communication were not made to the Persians. He was not convinced that the Persians were really hostile in their general attitude. His concrete suggestions for approaching them are contained in paragraph 10 of his despatch, flagged, which should be read, m include# a ede f inn r ■ i Colonel/ ( 7 - z -t'l‘!/ii.) redefinition of the siatas aua m the Gulf r (10) The Foreign Office in their letter of 11th P.2.274/32.

After consultation between the Foreign Office ana India Office, a telegram was sent, consulting India and the Resident, on 25th January -(flagged. H .) (11) In commenting on the Secretary of State’s telegram the Resident deprecates any prior, discussions with the Persians, and thinks it is v/iser^to wait and see a.nd not cnG fpd’ Ouu PiAnM' kul*, meet trouble halfway^ He reports that all the Arab rulers would authorise us to demand notification of visits if we ask them, but he thinks that the trouble ir, fact will solve itself. If a ship before visiting an Arab port does not notify its intention, it will receive no ceremonial and the visit will fall flat. If it does notify, the situation is solved. (12) The Government of India in their telegram of 8tlji February concur generally in Mr. Hoare’s proposal, as modified by the Foreign Office and India Office. They*.* propose that the Arab rulers should at once be approach^dT^* but that Mr. Hoare should not wait until a reply is received from them if he considers it desirable to start discussion with the Persians in the near future. They also ask for information as to the progress of the Persian ships and when they may be expected# /it &amp; To sum up, the Minister ^Tehran (both the Charge d’Affaires and the present Minister) and the Government of India are in favour of an wmir &lt; il'i communication to the Persians. Foreign Office and Admiralty do not seem to feel strongly either way.Colonel/ &gt;rr Minute Paper. Department. Colonel Biscoe seems to have changed his attitude from described at (6) above; and he now seems to suggest Minister, Tehran. On the whole, therefore, the balance of official opinion seems to be in favour of Mr. Hoare approaching the Persians. The balance of arguments also seems to be m the same direction. These mi^dit be summarised briefly - Arguments against: Persians about the Arab side of the Gulf, they will want us to specify the rulers to whom notification dispute our claim to speak for those rulers, and the issue of Bahrein, of the disputed islands, such as Tarob, and nossibly of the Trucial Sheikhdoms, will be raised. (ii) Such a communication would not be likely to do any good, for the Persians know our claims and we know theirs. (iii) If we adopt a waiting and watching policy, the question will probably solve itself. If we do not put the idea into the Persians’ heads, they may not visit the Arab side at all, or if they do,c*t(n) ■ Colonel Biscoe 1 s prophecy,may turn out correct. Arm-men!s fox: _ (i) It may be true that the communication to tne Persians might raise the issue of disputed sovereignty but this issue will in any ^case come up shortly m the general treaty negotiations, and it will not be necessary at this juncture to argue the matter with the Persians. All we want to do is to make our attitude clear. ^''Moreover, if the question is to ^o to arbitration later, our case will be strengthened by the fact that this communication has been made. (ii) Although the Persians and ourselves know our mutual claims, the arrival of Persian ships makes a new situation. If the matter is handled tactfully “ and Mr. Hoare seems competent to do so - a friendly agreement or agreement to differ may be reached with the Persians, and they may arrange to keep their ships on the Persian side, or at any rate not to precipitate an incident on the Arab side. In any case, they will have been made aware that we are awake and on the lookout, and this may act asa restraining influence upon them. (iii) It is not easy to see how the question can solye itself. If the Persians do not notify a particular visit and arrive unannounced, there may not be any salutes or ceremonies, but presumably they will not be actively prevented and will be given such facilities a are possible. The fact that they were not received with flags and ceremonial would presumably not deter them from going again if it suited them to do so. Moreover, Colonel Biscoe’s suggestion does not solve the problems given in Major Fowle’s letter of the 7th September/ A*&gt; ) isi^ yf- L ^ Lj l+l iyJZlsL A. Jz^ ) (tUcP.Z. 871/32. Draft Paper. Department. 1 5 FEB 1952 Sir, The Under Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letta of the 11th January, No. E 6314/2321/ 34, regarding the situation likely to arise from the arrival in the Persian Gulf of Persian naval units: copies of the telegram sent to the Government of India on the 25th January, and of the telegrams ^ have already been forwarded to your Department. Z, Sir Samuel Hoare has now carefully reviewed the whole question whether a communication should be made to the Persian Government, and if so in what terms. He notes that no serious exception is taken to the proposal that an oral communication should be made by H.M. Minister in Tehran except on the part of the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, who explains his reasons in his telegram of the 30th January, No. T/34. The Government of India, however, do not appear to be convinced by the arguments adduced, nor does Sir Samuel Hoare from Resident dated 30.1.32. subsequently received from the Government of India and the Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject from G. of I. to Resident dated 2.2.32. from Resident dated 4.2.32. from Resident dated 5.2.32. from G. of I. dated 8.2.32. from Resident dated 8.2.32. regard/regard them as conclusive. He understand from Admiralty letter dated 27th November r No. M.02516/31 (copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office) that the question of visits by British warships to Persian ports would not be affected by any suggestion that visits of Persian ships to Arab norts should not be made without prior notification. He agrees with uhe Resident that it might be preferable not - to inform the Persian Government that they will presumably wish their ships to ^ visit Arab ports, but he feels that it would be quite reasonable to assume the nossibilitv of it, and the dangerof^. putting the idea into their minds appears to him to be remote. He would refer m this connection to paragraph 6 of the Acting Resident’s despatch of 7th September, 1931 (copy forwarded to,the Ip. '***“ ^ r Foreign Office on October 2nd^ P.Z. 610£/31) s As regards paragraph 3 of the Resident telegram, S-tiHikuTraol agrooo wit s not corisist .oei Government of India that it }9N\0- t+ /} s' entirely with his demi^drficial letter 7&lt; the 29th October^b? which a copy was forwardedf^^bhe Foreign Office on 9th ^223/31. moreoverH^ratr even if a visit by a Persian ship should fall flat on the first occasion, irtr ytoiPH not necessarily 11 1 p; r ^ 0 L/' « H. t KV Department. £a±-I to be- repe^tteti-in Lhe~^ai:;e pla^e o r-c 1 oowhoro-,—an4 the fact that it had taken place without /u&gt;/./v C «iUt intoyforo^ioe- would strengthen any Persian claim to freedom of cruise and/visitj in Arab waters.

'®iile it is possible that controversial ^ nvirht be r-aased -with the- Per-siran eo\utJL vu-t Greife-nir’cnt- as a result of a communication such as is proposed^ ,it is to be expected that these deques hfili emerge shortly in connection / ru, ttU) 4 ^ with the treaty negotiations 7 , and if \ no tangible results are obtained at *XCs. this juncture the q^^stion need not be pursued until the general negotiations are resumed. All that is required at this stage is to inform the Persian Government of our attitude and^tro hope that they will respect it; Mr. Hoare, it appears from his despatch No. 686 of 2nd December, is not satisfied that tne general/general attitude of the Persian Government to this country is hostile, and evidently feels that he could engage with confidence in a discussion on this particular subject. 4 , It appears, therefore, to Siy Samuel Hoare that it is on the whole desirable to secure, if possible, some amicable understanding with the Persian Government before rather than after the danger arises of an incident which might catch H.M.G. unawares; and he would accordingly suggest, for the consideration of Sir John Simon, that the following steps should be taken forthwith: First, that an urgent enquiry should be sent to H.M. Ambassador in Rome as to the date on which the new Persian gunboats may be expected to leave finally for the Persian Gulf (44, would seem unnecessary to oohsider the patrol vessels, as^it^s understood that they are-uihlikely to prove a Secondly, that the Political Resident should be instructed to set about procuring authorisations/ from all the Arab Rulers as is suggested by the Government of India.

Department. the most cordial relations on the basis of international practice. No doubt the same motives actuate the Persian authorities, and for this reason Mr. Hoare ventures to mention a possible difficulty arising out of the application of international practice regarding visits of ships. The Persian vessels will no doubt have their hands full on the Persian side of the Gulf; but it is possible that a ship might on occasion wish to visit the Arab side. Were a Persian vessel, however, without some previou agreement, to visit any of tne poros or islands under the effective sovereignty of any of the iVrab Rulers enumerated in Article 1 °f the drpit General Treaty,' such a call^vould be liable to be regarded as an act of aggression.

My Lords also see no reason for saying we presume they will wish 1,0 send their warships to the ports on the Arabian side of the Gulf. There is some justification for presuming they will not do so.

So far as we know, there are no islands in the Shatt-el-Arab, as there are in the Gulf, whose ownership is claimed by Persia and whose sudden occupation by Persian naval forces might, in the absence of any international definition of their status, mke it more difficult to deal with the Persian claim. Moreover, if the need arises, the Ira^i Government, unlike the Arab Sheikhs in the Gulf, will always be able to address themselves to the local Persian and Italian diplomatic representatives regarding the conduct of the naval officials concerned; for Iraq, unlike the Gulf Arabs, lives in normal friendly relations with both Persia and Italy.

On those papers an express letter was sent to the G-ovemment of India on the 1st December suggesting that the Arab Rulers should ask us to inform the Persian (Government on their behalf that they will expect formal notification of any visit of a Persian warship to their ports. We now have a despatch j from the Minister at Tehran, P.Z. 140/32, reviewing the whole problem afresh. His concrete suggestions are contained in paragraph 10 of his despatch. We have not yet had any reply from the Government of India to our suggestion which seemed after the whole question has been exhaustively examined^ to offer the best hopes of success. It is rather tiresome that Mr. Hoare should now come forward with yet another possible solution. Obviously the ideal way of settling the matter be to get a general treaty settlement defining inter alia the position in the Gulf, but as the Persian ships are expected to appear in the duif within the next month or two a general settlement before then is quite out of the question. Mr. Hoare’s alternative proposal is the redefinition m the light of the new factor/viz. the Persian *«£«),c£the status au0 in the Gulf which the Persians have agreed to ■»ilL ■■■■- observe pending resumption of general negotiations. The Foreign Office are 'not convinced' of the desirability of attempting a redefinition and we may presumably agree that it is undesirable to embark on this project. It is very improbable that the Persians would caarait themselves in advance of general ;his ;oiio 8/:;i negotiationsm ; ; ;;3 negotiations to a definition in regard to the disputed Islands which will be satisfactory to us and in any case prolonged and probably inconclusive controversy would ensue which would only exacerbate our relations and not advance matters. ffhiie Mr. Hoare Fereian fg rfi di scnasil^L ^ jMuld pay visito en -the Ar-ab-si4»-and lead to treah- The Foreign Office in paragraph 4 of their Letter now submitted make an alternative suggestion as to the lines on which Mr. Hoare might approach the Persian Government orally.

The proposal is not in itself objectionable, but it would surely be much better if at the same time we were in a position to say that the Arab Rulers enumerated in Article I of the draft General Treaty (flagged) had definitely asked us to arrange that notification should be given in the event of j the Persian warships intending to visit the ports in their possession.

EOth January, 192E. Bear Walton, We should like to suggest three small amend ments in your draft telegram to the Government of India about the visits of Persian warships to Arab ports, as enclosed in your letter to me of January 18th. (a) We-would suggest that the last sentence of paragraph 1 should be redrafted to run: ”If the 'Persian Government wish, memorandum regarding 'status ct ^-0 might be communicated to them, but for 'reasons explained it would be undesirable to press 'them to subscribe to its terms'. This is a small but we feel that the objection to Hoare's i proposal lies not so much in the communication of a memorandum to the Persians, as in making any attempt to press them to subscribe to its terms. (b) Paragraph 2. Ne suggest that the last part of the second sentence should be redrafted to read: 'except/ J.C. Walton, Esq.,, C.3., M.C.r with^ipproach^o ^Persian Government 7 su^gested^Foreign Office® If, however/ impending'ar'rival of ^hips^ made very early communication'' desirable^finister migjit proceed r on lines proposed by Forei^i Office ^ forthwith^/ Mdressedio Government of India No/l?^ repeated to Resident, Per si an Gulf^No.'except to informing the Persians that we presume 'that an act of recognition would not be in harmony 'with their intentions'. It was not our intention to suggest telling the Persians that we presume that 'the 'possibility of recognition' is not in harmony with their intentions. Our idea was rather to suggest that something which might be interpreted as 'an act of 'recognition', such as the visit of a warship, would not be in harmony with their intentions.

Mr. Hoare has accordingly been asked whether he wishes in any way to modify his recommendations as to the manner in which the Persian Government should be approached. 2. The question of the instructions to be issued to Mr. Hoare in the event of the Persian Minister of CourWon arrival at Tehran approaching him with a suggestion for the re-opening of negotiations, as foreshadowed by Teymourtache in his conversation here on December 23 (see Sir John Simon’s telegram No. 195 of that date to Tehran), is receiving consideration. Meanwhile, Sir Samuel Hoare will observe that the alternative suggested by Mr. Hoare to uhe re-opening of negotiations with the Persian Government is a ”re-definition of the status quo ” in the Persian Gulf. The Secretary of State is not entirely convinced of the nder Secretary of State, F India office.desirability of endeavouring to arrive at such a re-definition in agreement with the Persian Government, more especially as it is doubtful whether the Persian Government could he induced to subscribe to an acceptable definition of the actual position at Bahrein, Tamb, Basidu, and other disputed points in the Gulf. o. Sir John Simon considers, nevertheless, that the statement regarding the position of the new Persian ships in the Gulf, suggested by Mr. Hoare in the penultimate sub- paragraph of paragraph 10 of his despatch, might afford a solution of the dilficulties discussed in the correspondence ending with Foreign Office letter No. E 5278/2821/34 of November 17 last, and would indeed be preferable to the alternative proposals considered in that letter. 4. i am therefore to suggest for Sir Samuel Hoare’s consideration the desirability of addressing a telegram to the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, inviting their immediate observations on the proposal that the Persian Government should be approached orally by Mr. Hoare in the following sense. The Persian Government, it could be stated, will presumably wish their ships to pay occasional visits to the Arab ports in the Gulf. This raises the issue of international practice. Were Persian vessels, without some previous agreement, to visit any of the ports or islands under the effective sovereignty of any of the Arab rulers enumerated in Article 1 of the draft General Treaty, such a call would be liable to be regarded either as an act of recognition or as an act of aggression. His Majesty’s Government presume that neither of these possibilities would be in harmony with the Persian Government’s intentions, and they feel that important issues of this naturenature, involving the possibility of friction, are better discussed before rather than after the event. o. lx the Persian Government should wish it, a memorandum regarding the status quo in the Gulf might be communicated to them, as suggested by Mr. Hoare; but the Secretary of state feels that it might be undesirable, for the reasons explained in paragraph 2 above, to press this suggestion unless there were clear indications that the Persian Government would be ready to accept and agree in a document on reasonable and satisfactory lines. 6.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,undesirable to afford any facilities under category (a) except in the case of the pier, the use of which it would probably be bo difficult to refuse that fhey comb icier it would be better to offer its use in the first instance. 4. With regard to (b), their Lordships are of opinion that, while maintaining our* rights, hospitality requires that to some extent these facilities must be offered to the Persian personnel including Persians as well as Italians. In this connection it is of interest to note what has been done at Wei-hai-Wei since its rendition to China in 1930. 5. Most of the former naval facilities on the Island, including half the dockyard, the Club, men’s canteen and playing fields, were retained by treaty for 10 years. The Chinese have now, since the rendition, habitually used Wei-hai-fei as a base for their M.K. Squadron, 6-4 small cruisers# 6 .

Sir, In reply to marine department netter No.2o92-M, dated 2nd November 1931, in which the Government of India have asked for my observations on certain questions relative to the British Naval Base at Henjam, i have the honour to offer the following remarks. 2. I agree with the political Resident that the Royal Navy cannot rely on the assumption that the visits of Persian Warships to Henjam will only be 1 T occasional”. 3. These visits raise two distinct situations. (a) The use of the anchorage itself, and lb) The use of facilities ashore. 4 . As regards (a), I can see no objection to the anchorage being shared with ships of the Persian Navy. No doubt when the situation arises, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf mil get into touch with the Senior officer of the Persian Ships and arrange berths for the ships of both Navies, British and Persian. 5 * As regards ib), i do not consider that any question of sharing the facilities available on shore with tne personnel of the Persian Navy - so far as they are contained in the boundry of the concession as laid down in clause I of the Henjam Protocol - can be accepted. 6 . As long as the 'status quo” exists, I consioer that the British Forces have the exclusive right of the use of these facilities and that this right should be insisted on.

To our mind, there are two alternatives ©pen to us, the first and most obvious being to resume and conclude the negotiation for &amp; general treaty and the second to re-define, in the light of the new factor, the. status quo* Ho far as we are concerned we rather doubt whether the time is ripe for further negotiation-; our last attempt i cue of way recent instances of th truth that abortive negotiations for a tr&gt; aty of friendship should , llfce a severe illness be followed by a period of rest; but we are in your hands and shell not refuse to negotiate if you wish it, but do noc say it is our fault if the only result is once again loss of temper* ’ ith regard to the re-definition of the status quo, we preauau that you will wit* your ship* to p y occasion 1 vl*lta to the ports on the other side of the Gulf.

The fact, which X touched on in ay let er quoted above, and which is confirmed in the M&amp;val Attache* s letter, that the ships will be officered by Italian Baval officere, will not lessen the effect of any incidents which imy arise. Being in Persian service they canoot claim special treatment, but any contretemps between us and the Persian Havy, in which such officers are serving, may have an unfortunate effect on the Italian Sovernment* 6. As to whether the Persian Bavy is likely to visit Arabian waters, .prima Iacj^ there would seem to be a distinct probability of it* Otherwise it is difficult to see why the Persian dove rumen t imve gone to the expense of having two gunboats built for them* -u-u of the four motor vessels is understandable. ,iith a Ion..-, coast line ** parts of it even now not under control, and *•* owing to exorbitant customs dues *• a brisk smuggling trade to ■v.th some form of .aotor putrol veaseifc, based on the various 8tw.il ports up and down Ure coaetj is a necessity.

I am not yet satisfied that the Persian Government ~ let us aay the Shah and fayaourtaohe - are definitely hostile. If the Shrh is f why when I presented my credentials aid he stage the little scene of goodwill reported in my despatch Ho. 61? of the 3rd November, 1931 io. There is Idle important side issue of Henjcm. My strong instinct is to share Sir P. Clive’s view that the Persian Government will never bluntly request us to leave* if we are right, there remain the pinpricks. I ?® not very clear on this point, but I imagine that we shall Plways be able to limit the depth of their ptneiraiion by saying to the Persians w if you wish us to evacuate kindly send us a note to that effect”. Personally, I should be strongly disposed to beg the officers of Hi© M* pasty’s Ships in the Gulf to maintain, as they have hitherto done, the mentality of those fakir© who take their ease on a bed of nails, ? t any rat© until the status of Bahrein has been definitely settled in our favour by one means or smother. If we moved to Bahrein before a settlement we should so obviously, in the event of arbitration, which, I observe, is now regarded as an ultimate possibility, have prejudiced our case that I #111 not elaborate the points furthermore it would be a poor acknowledg&amp;ent of the hospitality we have an for so many years to slip away from Hanjam like a default lag tenant. An arbitration to-day would presumably -go in h qvlt* favour on the principle of self-determination, but after Bahrein had been transformed into, say, the Gibraltar of the Hear Bast, the matter would be more /doubtfuldoubtful and bearing: the ^ • ■ •• ^Lotus' 1 caee of about five years ago In mind ^tien, if I remember right, four .judgea from landlocked countries outvoted the Representatives of Great Britain, the United states of America and Japan, I am ©lightly prejudiced against arbitrations between a great naval and a non~naval power* 14.

If, as I understand, the Persian fleet is to be based on Muhammerah, the ships will be frequently passing up and doim the Shatt, and the question of the distinction between the right of navigation and the right to patrol, to which reference was made in paragraph 3 of Young* s despatch Secret A of 11 ovember 12th, is almost sure to arise sooner or later. I have just seen a report that Persian launches carrying armed police have been patrolling in the Shatt al Arab recently and holding up ’Iraqi river craft. I enquiring into this further, but it suggests that the Persians may quite possibly give instructions to their fleet whifch will c&lt;-i,ise difficulties in the Shatt al Arab if some precaution is not taken.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 1291 of the 5th November, I have the honour to report that I took advantage of my first interview with Signor Grandi on his return from America to raise the question of the difficulties which might occur when the new Persian warships with their Italian officers reach the Persian Gulf. 2. Signor Grandi listened attentively to the outline of the position which I gave him, and said at once that there would be no difficulty in meeting the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. I said that it was desirable that the Persian Government should not get wind of these informal representations, and he told me that I could rely upon him to arrange that there should he no leakage on the part of the Italian officers. 3. In order that Signor Grandi should have the facts at his disposal, 1 left with him at his request a confidential memorandum, of which I enclose a copy, based on vour despatch. * I have. &amp;c.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom regard these claims also as completely without foundation. Finally, His Majesty's ships in the Persian Gulf have, for very many y: made use of a depot on the Island of Hen jam, and of Basidu on the Islanu Kishm. for refuelling purposes, and for the recreation of their crews, liis Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have offered, as part of a general treaty settlement with Persia, to renounce their rights at Basidu, and to regularise by a lease the position at Henjam. Negotiations for a general settlement are already advanced, and, pending a final solution of these questions the Persian Government have undertaken to observe the status quo. Rome, December 9, 1931.2 .Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lisler shares the view expressed by the Ac tin,;-; Hi ,h Commissioner in paragraph 4 of his despatch that in any negotiations on the subject of the Shatt-el-Arab frontier tho orsian Governnient will probably attempt to secure full rights for their warships to operate in tbo Shatt-el-Arab, and he therefore suggests that the questions raise- in the accompanying despatch should be considered at the Inter-departmental Conference which is to be hold on Wednesday, tho 16th December for the purpose of discussing the Persian claims in respect of the Shatt-el-Arab, the proposed Conservancy Board, and lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf. 3. As re jards paragraph P of the despatch, i am to invite attention to the letter from the foreign Office to the India Office of the l?th of Hovember regarding the visits of Persian warships to ports on the Arabian silo of the lersian Gulf, a copy of which was sent to the Colonial Office under cover of your letter Mo.E.5278/28ri/34 of the 18th of Hovember. The Secretary of State trusts that before a decision is reached on this question due consideration will be given to the aspect of the matter discussed by lajor Younglinute Paper. Department.

(b) (c) (d) (s) Teheran Despatch of 23 July, 1931, particularly paras. 3 and 4 (P.Z.5768/31) .

(f) Colonel Biscoe's demi-official letter to Mr. Howell of 29 October (P.Z.7223/31). Steps have already been taken to instruct the British Embassy at Rome to suggest that one of the points that might be brought to the knowledge of the Italian naval officers who will command Persian ; vessels, should be that since the Persian Government do not at present recognise the Arabian Rulers and have no diplomatic relations with them, a visit by a Persian war ship to an Arab port would scarcely be in accordance with ordinary international usage. /£. The question dealt with in / correspondence cited above is whether any coiimunication, .and if so what, should be made to th e Persian Governm ent with a view to controlling visits of Persian warships to Arab ports. Mr. Dodd raised the question whether the Persian Government should be warned that visits will not be allowed, or would only be allowed under conditions to be decided upon. Major Fowle suggested that/ 4494a 5000 5/30+ *£&gt; pprsian Government on behalf ofi we shoxrld inform the Persia p ^ xu i o++ or riesi^e to have notice the Arab rulers that the latter uesi-e _ tne . . „ c ,u a j for before each visit of riven or their permission asked xor.oei s Persian .ar.MP- The “TI ”* his s^«»n. proposal ^ should .t onoo infonn «. dr* r«l«. «» position «&gt;» “ expression of Sieir .ish» that the Persist should not visit their ports o«ept pith thoir previous p.r- mission,to ho applied for by the Persian. throo#i us, and that ». should then inform the Persi™ Covornment that the rulers of the Arab States in the Gulf (not specifying them) have desired 'is to convey these wishes. The Foreign Office consider that the Arab rulers should not be encouraged to insist on pertnissioa because this would disturb the arrangement which has been readied wiu.i the Persian Government that the latter will not necessar ily require applications f or permission for our vessels to visit their ports. The Foreign Office then go on to discuss the question whether the Arab rulers might' require previous notice . They consider that a communi cation, in the sense suggested by the Government of India, (not specifying the rulers in question) would certainly evoke a request that the rulers referred to should be specified^, and a subsequent, challenge of our ri^iti| to speak on behalf^of Bahrein, with the result that Persia’s claim to sovereignty over that place would come again to c.ne lore; the Foreign Office are apprehensive of a controversy which ’’would only further injure AngLo- Pei sian islations”. On the other hand they give weight to tne argument that the question of sovereignty is likely in any case to become acute again in the near future, and. that if the proposed communication, which uney admiL to be in itself a reasonable and legitimate one/3818a 5000 8/29 dinute Paper. Department. one, is made^o the Persian Government now and a controversy ensued, we should enter the latter on a straightforward issue. The Foreign Office are thus in two minds about the question. It is submitted that if it appears desirable to adopt the straightforward course of informing the Persian Government, on behalf of the Arab rulers, that the latter will desire to have notice of the visit of any Persian warship, we ought not to be deterred from doing so on account of the quite unsubstantial Persian claim to Bahrein, the hollowness of which has already been exposed in Sir .A. Chamberlain 1 s note of 18 February 1929, copy of which was communicated to the League of Nations. Colonel Biscoe also suggests aiming at notice not permission;and indicates a different procedure from that proposed by the Government of India. It looks as if he had not seen the Government of India’s Express letter of 5 October (though they sent copy to Bushire) when he wrote his demi-official letter oi 29 October to Mr. Howell. He suggests that the rulers should wait for the first visit and pay the usual courtesies (such as salutes and exchange of visits) and that then, the Persian Government should be asked to give notice of future visits and that if they declined courtesies / J J should in future be withheld. On ' the whole, subject to the views of the Admiralty (which have not yet been received on the Government of India’s Express Letter, it seems best to ; ma ke a communication to the Persian Government before I any visit takes place and a precedent is thus set ! up/To anyone who heen in the narrow and turning waters of the Gulf^ -possihility of visits hy Persian warships to Arah ports” is a certainty so long as they are connianded ty Italian officers, whatever we may say to the Italian Government or they may pass on to them - which, hy the 'by, will reach Persian ears sooner or later. Hence I agree with the line taken in the draft. Indeed, I should like to go a little further and make a virtue of necessity by couching the message from our protected chiefs in warmer terms: e.g. that they would welcome visits from the Persian Navyjr If anything could put the Persians off these embarrassing visits^this might. ^)raft Paper. / W, ■ p2- Department.

The Secretary of State will be aware that no definite progress has been made towards arriving at an agreement with Persia as to the terms of the Notes it was proposed to exchange with reference to Article III to explain the conditions under which H.M.Ships would visit Persian Ports.

POLITIC SECRET DEPT. iSe*3* While Persia wanted us to ask permission, except in the case of special ports, our general intention was that we should adhere to the principle of notification onl$ in the case of all ports and that in the case of'visits to Abadan, Henjam, Kharag and Bushire the notification would onlj? be to the local authorities# My Lords therefore feel that in order not to prejudice the position of H.lUShips in the Gulf it is desirable that Persia should only be required to notify projected visits to the Trueial Coast and not be required to ask for formal permission. 4. It should be noted in this connection that we have recently had some recognition by Persia of the arrangement irade in 19E8 by which H.M.Ships stationed in the Gulf visit all Persian ports on simple notification to the local authorities (vide despatch No.378 of July 15, from H#M. Representative, Tehran). This might be regarded as a precedent for Persia notifying us through the Political Resident. On the other hand, however, there is perhaps a danger that Persia may claim it as a precedent for notifying the Arab rulers direct. 5. Subject to the amendment required by the preceding paragraphs My Lords concur in the first proposal made in paragraph 4/paragraph 4 of the Government of India letter. Thej 7 also concur that opportunity should then be taken to infom the Persian Government that the Rulers of the Arab States in the Gulf have desired us to convey an intimation to this effect to the Persian Government. I am, however, to suggest that such intimation should merely be made informally at a convenient opportunity. 6 . My Lords concur that it would be unnecessary to make specific reference to Bahrein or any other individual State. 7. With reference to paragraph 8 of the despatch of 7.9.31. from the officiating Political Resident in the to do in the Gulf. The Persians would be extremely suspicious of any proposals we put forward and unlikely to agree to anything that appeared to them to put any sort of restriction on the movements of their new war vessels. The friendly atmosphere envisaged might well develop without any previous arrangement, whereas the Persians appear at present/present to be too suspicious of us and too jealous of our present position in the Gulf to be reasonable in making a previous arrangement. 8.

In the meantime my own views are as follows. 2. Tlie foreign Office draft to the Italian Government would be excellent as an addition to any agreement come to with the Persian Government; as a substitute it seems to me distinctly o?~ inadequate. Ihe whole question/previous permission from, or notice to, us, or the Arab Rulers, is ignored. Dodd stresses the importance of this omission at the end of paragraph 5 of his despatch. 3. The Foreign Office draft says 'were the Persian fleet to show undue activity in the territorial waters of Bahrain' Again 'any Persian aggression against the territories or islands of these rulers any objectionable activities by Persian warships in their ports and territorial waters, or any unjustifiable interference with their vessels upon the high seas could not be a matter of indifference to His Majesty’s Government'. 2xis is satisfactory of course, but seems to me, unless I'm being stupid, to miss the whole point. We can’t prevent Persian ships visiting the Arab coast* all we want to ensure is that they shall do ^ so- as pointed out in your Express letter Mo.F.369-N/29 (in which I was glad to see you agreed generally with the views expressed in my letter Ho. 583-S of 7th September 1931)- under the same terms as do the ships of other nations. It is not a question of 'undue' or 'objectionable' activities on the part of Persian ships visiting Arab territorial waters. It is the fact that, once a Persian 1Persian gunboat has shown the ordinary Activity* which may be expected of it of visiting an Arab port (especially Bahrain), without previous notice or permission, a difficult situation arises* Perhaps I may be permitted, for ready reference, to quote the relevant portion of my letter No*583-S. 'the Persian authorities will presumably not inform us of the cruises of their ships, and the first the Political Resident will learn of their visit to Muscat, or Bahrain or Kuwait will be a telegram from the local Political Agent announcing their arrival and asking what attitude is he and the local Euler expected to take ^ up? If- on the receipt of such a telegram- we do nothing then the Persian Government can argue that 'silence gives consent' and that they have the freedom of cruise in Arab waters. If we object the Persian Government can ask why no previous warning was given to them, having once sent their ships- without observing any formalities- to an Arab port they will be much less likely to agree to observing formalities in future, and a difficult impasse will ensue'#CgrY U: r ^ | i\ ‘ In any further communication this subject, please quote lo.

INDIA OFFICE S.W.l. 6 ^ © 17th November, 1931. Sir, ^ ^ With reference to your letter No.P.Z.6562/31 of October 21, regarding the situation arising from the purchase 'by the Persian Government of gunboats and patrol vessels for service in the Persian Gulf, I am directed 'by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he has now considered the proposal contained in paragraph 4 of the Government of India’s express letter No.F.569-N/29 of October 5 to the effect that the Arab rulers of Koweit, Bahrein, El-Katr, Muscat and the Tracial coast should be informed of the possibility that Persian v/arships may shortly appear in the Persian Gulf; that an attempt should be made to secure from those rulers a formal written expression of their wish that Persian ships should not visit their ports except with their previous permission, to be applied for through the British authorities; and that an early opportunity should then be taken to inform the Persian Government, without specifically referring to Bahrein or to any other individual state, that the rulers of the Arab States in the Gulf have desired His Majesty’s Government to convey an intimation to this effect to the Persian Government. 2. The Secretary of State feels that there are strong objections to an attempt to insist that the Persian Government shall apply to British authorities for permission for the visit of their warships to Arab ports. The Persian Government, if obey were to accept such a proposal, would certainly insist that His Majesty’s Government should in future similarly obtain permission for each separate visit of a British warship to any Persian port, including fader Secretary of State, India Office.including ill© result migtitj therefor©^ he th&amp;t o. British warship would not thereafter 'be able to visit Henjam ior purposes ol refuelling or recreation for the ship’s company without having to await special authority from the Tehran Government. Such application for special authority according to paragraph 6 of Sir R. Clive’s despatch No.496 of October 7, 1930 (of which a copy was sent to you in Foreign Office letter No.E 5643/3/34 of November 6 of that year) might well involve in each case a decision of the Persian Council of Ministers; and moreover permission would in many instances inevitably be delayed, and might even occasionally be refused. 3. I am therefore to suggest, for the consideration of Sir Samuel Hoare, that for these reasons, the proposal that the Arab rulers concerned should be encouraged to insist on their permission being obtained for the visits of Persian warships should not be pursued. An alternative course of action would be to suggest to these rulers that the Persian Government should be informed on their behalf that they will expect formal notification before Persian warships visit their ports. While, however, this revised proposal is not open to the same objection, the Secretary of State is not yet convinced that a communication in this sense to the Persian Government would necessarily improve the situation. 4. If the Persian Government return any reply to a communication on these lines or take any notice of Mr. Hoare s note, their reply will almost certainly take the form of an enquiry to which of the Arab rulers the note is intended to refer. The Persian Government’s reply may well then proceed to question the right of His Majesty’s Government to speak for any ofof the Trucial or other Sheikhs, whose special relations with His Majesty’s Government have never been recognised by Persia. The Persian Government will, moreover, undoubtedly question the right of His Majesty’s Government to address to them a communication on behalf of the Sheikh of Bahrein, whom they regard as a Persian subject in virtue of their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein. In any case, they will regard the ports of Bahrein, and the disputed islands such as Tamb, as not covered by any arrangement to which they might even tacitly agree. 5. It is therefore doubtful v/hether the proposed communication to the Persian Government can lead to any practical results as regards Bahrein, Tamb, or any other of the real danger points in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, it may provoke a controversy with the Persian Government which, if it proves inconclusive, would only further injure Anglo-Persian relations, and might even precipitate the very incident which it is desired to avert. 6 . There is, however, an argument of a different nature which might be adduced in support of the proposal. Unless the Persian Government can be induced to withdraw their claims to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa in the near future as part of the general treaty settlement, in return for such concessions as His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India may be prepared to make the question of the sovereignty over these islands is bound again to become acute. In that event it may prove necessary for His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, however muchconsit of the is sai fell T: favour and no for in rimuch tney may dislike such a course, to agree to refer these disputed claims to arbitration. This possibility must be borne in mind in any steps which may now be taken in connexion with ^ Persian activities in the Gulf, and it is arguable that by making the proposed communication to the Persian Government at the present stage, even if no immediate or practical result be achieved, the British case may be slightly strengthened if and when arbitration takes place. 7. Finally, the following further argument merits consideration. It may be held that a dispute with the Persian Government over the position of their new warships vis-a-vis * 3 of the Arab rulers is sooner or later inevitable. If nothing is said at the present stage regarding the attitude of the Arab rulers towards the new Persian Navy, that dispute may well become suddenly acute, possibly in circumstances more favourable to Persia, in connexion with some specific incident 1 r and not on the main straightforward issue. The Persians may, for instance, attempt to occupy Tamb and confront His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India with a fait accompli , which might weaken the British position in any eventual arbitration; or they might arrest a Bahreini dhow, disputing its national status, or basing their action on some irrelevant circumstance. On the other hand, if the proposed communication, which is in itself a reasonable and legitimate one, is made to the Persian Government now, their reaction to it may be a useful guide to their probable future attitude, and, if a controversy is inevitable sooner or later, it may be better that it should arise on a straightforward issue, and to some extent in circumstances favourable to His Majesty’s Government, who may thus] ri thus he able to pursue it in more favourable conditions than if it were forced on them later as a result of some incident, the circumstances of which might obscure and confuse the main issue. 8 . In conclusion, I am to explain that while the Secretary of State has not yet reached a definite conclusion with regard to this question, he v/ould he glad to receive Sir Samuel Hoare s further observations on the whole situation, in the light of the above considerations. 9.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, der-Secretary of State, Office.fo.1291- E 5188/2821/34) nm^IDEMTIAL . Sir, Since the receipt of your despatch No*570 (118/7/31) of the 31st July, regarding the construction in Italy of two nine hundred and fifty ton gun-boats and four three hundred and thirty ton patrol vessels on behalf of the Persian Government, the situation which may arise in consequence of the arrival oi these vessels in the Persian Gulf has been engaging the attention of His Majesty’s Government. z. The ostensible reason for the acquisition of these vessels by the Persian Government is to enable the Persian Customs authorities to put an end to the contraband traffic alleged to be carried on by native vessels from the Arabian shore of the Gulf. But the main object of the two larger vessels is probably to assert Persia’s imagined political rights in the Gulf; and, in view of the militant character of modern Persian nationalism, of the claims advanced by Persia to sovereignty over certain Arabian islands in the Gulf, and of the distaste with which the present Persian Government view British influence in that region, the general position is such as to give His Majesty’s Government cause for apprehension. 3. As stated in your despatch, these Persian vessels will at first be commanded by Italian naval officers. In these circumstances the Persian Government may endeavour to take advantage of these officers’ ignorance of the general situation in the Persian Gulf, and misrepresent it to conform to their own pretensions - in order to create some incident i which ©llency Right Honourable Sir Ronald Graham, G.C.M.G., G-C.V.Q., etc., etc., etc., Rome.which, “they might turn, to their own advent age* 4. In order, therefore, that the Italian officers in Persian service in the Gulf may he confidentially informed in advance hy their own Government of the true facts of the Gulf situation, I shall he glad if Your Excellency will at a suitable opportunity let the Italian Government know of the difficulties likely to arise after the arrival of these war vessels in the Gulf, as a result of the conflict between Persian pretensions and the special interests of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in that region, and more especially, their relations with the rulers of the Arabian coast. For example, were the Persian fleet to show undue activity in the territorial waters of Bahrein, to the sovereignty of which the Persian Government have advanced a wholly unsubstantiated and untenable claim, or were aggressive action taken against the Arab rulers, with whom His Majesty’s Government are in special treaty relations, or their territories, the resulting developments could not fed 1 to be embarrassing and regrettable. 5. The particular points which, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, might advantageously be brought to the knowledge of Italian naval officers in Persian service are as follows (a) the special treaty relations between His MaiQslz/s ~ Govern ment and certain Arabian rulers * His Majesty s Government and the Government of India are in treaty relations with the rulers of the territories along the Arabian littorallittoral of the Gulf, viz. the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrein, and El Kfcr, the Sultan of Muscat, and the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast - i.e. of Rasal-Khaima, Umm-al-Qaiwain, Ajman, Shargah, Dahai, and Abu Dhabi. His Majesty’s Government are under obligations to these rulers to conduct their relations with all foreign governments, and eonseqiuently any Persian aggression against the territories or islands of these rulers* any objectionable activities by Persian warships in their posts and territorial waters, or any unjustifiable interference with their vesseals upon the high seas could not be a matter of indifference to His Majesty’s Government. (b) The absence of relations between the Persian Govern - ment and these Arabian rulers * The Persian Government do not, at present, recognise these Arabian rulers and have no diplomatic relations with them, so that the visit of a Persian warship to an Arab port would scarcely be in accordance with ordinary international usage. It may be added that His Majesty’s Government have Endeavoured to remedy this state of affairs by securing, as part of a general treaty settlement, the recognition of these rulers by Persia. (c) Persian claim to the Islands of Bahrein . The Persian Government have revived an anticiuated claim to the islands of Bahrein, which lie off the Arabian shore oi the Gulf, and from which Persian troops were driven out in the year 1785 by the native Ar*ab inhabitants. His Majesty’s Government consider this claim entirely without foundation.

In broaching this subject in the most friendly way to the Italian Government, Your Excellency will explain that I have instructed you to do so because Anglo-Italian relations throughout the world are of so friendly and intimate a nature that I naturally wish to prevent, by complete frankness, the possibilitypossibility of any incident due either to inadvertence design on the part of a third party. I am, with great truth and respect* Sir, Your Excellency’s obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (Sd.) G. W. RENDER!/28yl/34) 8 . I-; entlalj. I My Lord Marquess.. With reference to Your Lordship's Confidential despatch No. 521 (E 4058/2821/34) of September 10th, concerning the future .Persian Navy, X have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch v/hich I have received from the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the same subject. 2. Major Fowle's views will be seen to coincide for the most part with those which I had the honour to set forth in my despatch No. 386 of July 23rd; he fears that no amount of vigilance on the part of Ills Majesty's Representatives and Officers in the Persian Gulf would be sufficient to prevent the creation of that situation which it is so essential to avoid, namely, the unannounced arrival of a Persian warship in one of the ports of the Arab Coast. He had not, however, seen when he wrote this despatch the correspondence enclosed in Your Lordship's despatch under reference, and was therefore unaware of the proposal to approach the Italian Government in the matter. 3. My observations on the draft despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires at Rome have not been called for, and it appears that the draft may have been approved by the Departments concerned, ana the despatch sent, before this reaches Your Lordship. I venture, nevertheless, to suggest, for what the suggestion may be Honourable Marquess of Reading, G.C.B. , 3 ' tc * j etc. , etc. , The Foreign Office.worth, the desirability of expanding m the following sense the information which it is proposed to convey privately to the Italian Government. 4. Two points are covered by the draft as it at present stands: the special treats - + • ^ treaty relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab rm^ , lu J-ers, and the Persian claim i»o Bahnsin, ‘lamb and. Abu Mu^* ' a MUSa * Nothing is said of the position at Han^am and Basidu and thi a m * v.Tiu this may perhaps be because the British claim to the Aatter) is weah, while the ^r is undisputed Persian territoV^ Yet the possibility of some regrettable incident occurring at one or the other of these two places cannot be overlooked, and while the Persian Government are most unlikely to inform the Italian officers of the assurances which they have given in regard to the maintenance of the status quo, they will probably see to It that the latter are made aware of the illegality of the Henjam depot and the alleged illegality of the Basidu enceinte, ihere would, I ieel, be no need, when approaching the Italian Government, to enter into possibly embarrassing explanations concerning the legal position at Henjam and Basidu; all that would be necessary is an intimation to the effect that His Majesty’s Ships have used these places for a very long time past, that His Majesty’s Government have offered to renounce their disputed claim to Basidu, and to regularise Hy a lease the position at Henjam, as part of a general treaty the negotiation of which, though temporarily suspended, is already far advanced; and that pending the final settlement of these questions — a settlement the broad outlines of which have already been agreed upon — the Persian Government have promised to observe the status quo. A similar intimation might, I consider, be made with advantage in regard to the relations between the Arab rulers and/and the Persian Government. The present draft explains the position of these rulers vis-a-vis of His Majesty’s Government, hut makes no mention of their relations, or rather lack of relations, with Persia. if it were explained to these Italian oj-ficers that the Government which they are 'being called upon to serve does not, at present, recognise the Arab sheikndoms and has no diplomatic relations with them, and that consequently ohe visit of a Persian warship to an Arab port would constitute a grave breach of international etiquette; and if it were lurther explained that in the course of the treaty negotiations already alluded to His Majesty’s Government had endeavoured to remedy this state of affairs by securing rersia s consent, in principle, to the recognition ol the sheikhdoms, it seems to me that there &gt; would be far less risk of the Italians failing to keep in touch with the Political Resident in the event of their being ordered to visit one of the ports on the Arab shore. Having received such a warning before their departure, they could hardly do less than notify the Resident of any such orders which they might receive, for they would naturally be anxious to create a good impression by a strict observance of international courtesies; and if it were definitely intimated to the Italian Government that permission, as opposed to notification, was required before foreign warships could visit the Arab ports, it is even possible that the Italian officers might be induced to seek permission from the Resident, though such a course would evidently involve them in trouble 'with the Persian Government sooner or later. It is perhaps questionable whether an intimation to the effect that any visit of Persian warships to Arab ports would be a breach of etiquette could logically be combined with one to the effect that permission must be sought for such a visit/ &lt;{ ■ ■visit. aut m my opinion it is very necessary that these officers should be made aware of the lack of relations between Persia and ^he sheikhdoms, and the second intimation might perhaps be made more compatible with the first by explaining that in the interest of maintaining friendly relations with Persia, His Majesty's Government would not, in practice, draw atit)©n'tion to such a dsrogation from intornational custom provided always that permission were first soupftt . 6.

Sir In continuation of my letter No. 383-S of 8th June 19ol , j_ iici.ve cue honoui' oo refer to endorsement No. 570 of 31st July 1931 from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome to the Foreign Office, enclosing letter No. 10/31 of 29th July from the British Naval Attache on the subject of the two 950 ton ships which are being built for the Persian Government. 2. It will be seen that the ships in question are almost completed - one will be ready next October and the other in November. It is most unlikely that the Italian authorities would have proceeded thus far without having received payment for construction and in fact arrangements for this have apparently been made vide Minister, Tehran’s despatch No. 67 of May 16th, 1931. After completion the ships will of course have to undergo trials, be fitted with armament, etc., and finally make the voyage to the Gulf. This will take time, but I imagine not so very long and so we may reasonably expect a Persian fleet - in the shape of one or two ships - to materialize in the Persian Gulf at the ^ginning of next year. 3./are proceeding 3. How the four motor patrol vessels I have no information. According to the enclosure to Minister, Tehran f s despatch quoted above the dates of their completion are July, oeptember, and October 1931 4. The subject of the Persian Navy was discussed at an Interdepartmental Conference held at the India Office on 20th Juli last. -i.jiG last sentence of the conclusion reads as follows. But ior tne moment there seemed nothing to be done but to wait on events and to keep a sharp look-out for any Persian aggression or interference. !? in this connection I venture to point out that ~ once the Persian Navy is ’in being’ - no amount of watchfulness on our part can be trusted to prevent a difficult and possibly unpleasant situation arising if a visit by a Persian war-ship is actually made to Arab ports and waters. The Persian authorities will presumably not inform us of the cruises of their ships, and the first the Political Resident will learn of their visit to Muscat, or Bahrain or Kuwait will be a telegram from the local Political Agent announcing their arrival and asking what attitude is he and the local Ruler expected to take up? If - on the receipt of such a telegram - we do nothing then the Persian Government can argue that ’’silence gives consent” and that they have freedom of cruise in Arab waters. If we object the Persian Government can ask why no previous warning was given to them, having once sent their ships - without observing any formalities to an Arab port they will be much less likely to agree to observing formalities in future, and a difficult i mpasse will ensue. 5. The fact, which I touched on im my letter quoted above, and which is confirmed in the Naval Attache’s letter, that the ships will be officered by Italian Naval officers, will not lessen the effect of any incidents which may arise. Being in Persian/32*7 5 i'ersian service they cannot claim special treatment, but any contretemps between us and. the Persian Navy, in which such officers are serving, may have an unfortunate effect on the Italian Government. 6. As to whether the Persian Navy is likely to visit Arabian waters, prima facie there would seem to be a distinct probability of it. Otherwise it is difficult to see why the Persian Government have gone to the expense of having two gunboats built for them. The raison d’etre of the four motor vessels is understandable. With a long coast line - parts of it even now not under control, and - owing to exorbitant customs dues - a brisk smuggling trade to contend with, some form of motor patrol vessels based on the various small ports up and down the coast, is a necessity. But the two gunboats would appear to be more or less of a luxury, built merely for the purpose of ’showing the flag,’ and that they will keep wholly to Persian waters seems to me - at the least - unlikely. 7. The possibility of aggressions by the Persian Navy on the Arabian coast is dealt with in Mr. Dodd’s despatch No.386 of 23rd July, 1931. In 1887 - as Mr. Dodd points out - the Persian Government gained possession of the island of Sirri by seizing it and presenting His Majesty’s Government with a fait accompli . It is not beyond all possibility that they might try to repeat this coup de main on Tamb or Abu Musa for instance, and thougn doubtless they would not on this occasion be equally successful the attempt would raise a very serious situation. Apart too from actual attempts to seize territory, minor acts of aggression on outlying Arab islands would always l)© possible. |SS|1 9 . 8. The opinions expressed by Mr. Dodd in paragraphs 3 and 4 of his despatch would appear to carry considerable weight. It may oe impracticaole to prevent Persian yun~ boats visiting Arabian waters, but if they do make such visits then it would seem most desirable that they should do so on their 'lawful occasions', like the war-ships of other nations, but under some form of control such as previous permission or notice being applied for. If this could be arranged the usual courtesies in the form of salutes, interchange of visits and mutual hospitality between the local Rulers and the Political Agents and the Commanders of gunboats, would take place. His Majesty’s Navy would, I am sure, be happy to cooperate, and thus a friendly atmosphere would be created which would be flattering to the Persian Government, and make them much less likely to try aggression or interference. The fact too that the gunboats will be commanded by Italian officers, while increasing the delicacy of any incidents which may arise, will on the other hand make such officers much less likely to lend themselves as catspaws to the designs of the Persian Government, If friendly personal relations have been cemented between them and the Political and Naval authorities in the Gulf. This friendly atmosphere, however, can only be built up on the basis of a previous arrangement with the Persian Government. The alternative is to have no such arrangement when the possibility, or probability, of an impasse arising - euoh as envisaged in paragraph4 above - must be faced.9. One of the difficulties brought up at the Inter departmental Conference was that the Persians might well question our right to speak on behalf of the Rulers of the Arab coast* But - nominally at all events - could not these Rulers speak ior themselves? Could not their communications, as to their desire to have permission asked for from them before Persian gunboats visited their waters, be handed to the Persian Government by us acting merely as their agents - in the same way as we are acting at present for Muscat vis-a-vis the Muscat and American Governments in the matter of the Muscat tariff? The Persian Government might complain that though the hands were Esau’s, the voice was Jacob’s, but the sentiment of the communications would at any rate be quite sincere as the last thing the Arab Rulers want is uncontrolled permission for Persian gunboats to cruise in Arab waters. Muscat is of course an independent State, and presumably could address what communication it liked (through us) to the Persian Government - the only difficulty being that the latter have not recognised Muscat as a State. Bahrain and Kuwait are in a different category but - by stretching a point - might possibly be allowed to send a communication through us to the Persian Government* The cognate question, of course, arises as to what should be the channel of communication between the Persian Government and the Rulers in the matter of permission or notice (see paragraph 10 below)* I imagine that this would have to be through us again, as to allow independent communications between bhe Persian authorities and the Arab Rulers - even on a single specific subject sent as movements of ships - would be undesirable. 10. The crux of the situation would appear to be the Persian claim to Bahrain, and I am of course fully alive to the seriousserious considerations brought forward on this point at the conference by the representative of the Foreign Office, as also that the Persian Government might regard our insistence on a control over the visits of these gunboats to the Arabian coast as a species of retaliation, and in reply make themselves oonoxious at Hen jam and elsewhere* But — I venture to suggest - would it not be possible to wrap up our request to the Persian Government in such a way as to show that no retaliation was intended? Gould we not say that on the basis of mutual co-operation in the Gulf of the two Navies - British and Persian (!) - a mutual knowledge of the movements of each other’s ships was necessary, and that just as British war-ships warned Persian authorities of their visits to Persian waters bo prima facie there was nothing unreasonable in the request that Persian war-ships should do the same by the Arab Rulers? (This is more or less on the lines of a suggestion made by Colonel Biscoe at the Conference except that his views were in favour of ’permission’ not i '{notice’). We could add - if this were thought advisable that as a matter of practice even H.M.Ships did not enter Arab ports without warning the local Political Agent who passed the information to the Ruler. If we argued on these lines then we might have to give way on the matter of ’permission’ and merely insist on ’notice’. The latter is not as strong as the former of course, but at any rate it would (a) preclude any claim of Persian sovereignty to the Arab coast: oo prevent surprise visits: (c) regularise the situation. Briefly what I feel personally is that some arrangement with the Persian Government previous to their Navy materialising is distinctly better than none atV * • ' J I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for India, His Majesty’s Charge d 1 Affaires, Tehran and (with copy of the despatch of 29th July 1931 from the Naval Attache, Rome) the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division.

Subject to what is said below, we are disposed generally to agree with observations of Officiating Political Resident as stated in his letter dated the 7th September ho. 583-S (copy sent to you direct). In particular we support his view (which coincides with that expressed by His Majesty's Charge d^ffaires Tehran in his Despatch ho. 386, dated the 23rd July 193l) that question should be taken up betimes and our position clearly defined beforehand to Persian Government. 3. Whether Treaty negotiations come to fruition or not, ^se are unable to dissociate this question from subject matter of Article III of draft Treaty. For we consider it in the extreme unlikely tha t (Signature) &amp; 44 / (Desi^jshoiion)that Persia will be satisfied with any less facilities in Arab ports for her ships than she accords to ours in her own. In point of fact formal application is made to us #ien ships of other Powers desire permission to visit ports on Arab side of Gulf and we think - though we have not yet consulted His Excellency the laval Commander-in-Chief on this point and an expression of his views will follow as soon as possible - that Persia should be required to conform to this vide final redraft of Article III - even at the cost of our having to do the same for visits of our ships to Persian ports other than Abadan, question of visits to which does not arise, since, we believe, our ships can refuel there without technically entering Persian port. 4 • Subject to any objections which Political Resident may offer, we suggest that steps be taken at once to apprise all Heads of States mentioned in Article I of draft Treaty of possibility that Persian ships of war may shortly appear in Gulf, life do not apprehend that it would be difficult to secure from them formal written expression of their wish that Persian ships should not visit their ports except with their previous permission and that application for such permission should be made by Persians through us. HJarly opportunity should then be taken to inform Persian Government that Rulers of Arab States in Gulf have desired us to convey intimation to this effect to Persian Government. In making this communication we think that it would be unnecessary to make specific reference to Bahrain or any other individual State.8 Articles XII and XIII.

M But for the moment there seemed nothing to be done but to wait on events and to keep a sharp look out for any Persian aggression or interference .* la this connection I venture to point out that - once the Persian ilavy is 1 in being * - no amount of watchfulness on our part can be trusted to prevent a difficult and possibly un pleasant situation arising if a visit by a Persian war-ship is actually made to Arab ports and waters. *he Persian authorities will presumably not inform us of the cruises of their ships, arid the first the iolitical Besident will _ learn of their visit to Muscat, or Bahrain or Kuwait will be a telegram from the local Political Agent announc t/ieir arrival, and asking what attitude is he and the local Euler expected to take up v if - oa trie receipt of s^ch a telegram - we do nothing then the Persian Government can / argue that * sHence gives consent 4 and that they have freedom of cruise in Arab waters* If we object ‘-aep | Persian Government can ask why no previous warn.ing was How the four motor patrol vessels ax© proceeding 4. flic subject of the Persian liavy was discussed given.locid * * • * to ono# sent tiioix ship# m witiiout v ooeex'TiHg bmx^ foriiaXiti##♦- to an Ar&amp;te port th.&amp;^ v^ill feo mucli l#ss Xik©ly to agre# to ohm&amp;vin^ formalities in future, and a difficult ianaaae will ensue. | The I act, which X touched on in agr lot tor quoted above, and which is confirmed in the I&amp;val Attache* s letter, that the ship# will be officered by Italian lava!

Could not their comm nic&amp;tions as to their desire to have permission asked for from them be. ore Persian gunboats visited their waters, be handed to the Persian Government by us act ng merely as their agents - in the sans way as we are acting at present for liuscat ’■i 1 . vis-a-vis the ^.upen-t and American Governments in the matter of * ^ the Muscat tariff* The Persian Government might complain that though the hands were the voice was Jacob's, but tile sentiment of the eosMmilcaiions would at any rate be quite sincere as the last ttMgf the Arab ulers want is uncontrolled permission for Persian gunboats to cruise in Arab waters* Muscat is of course an independent State, and presumably could address what communication it liked { tiii'ough us ) to t;ip Persian Government — the only difficulty being vhst the latter isave not recognised Muscat as a State* Bahra.in and Kuwait are in a different category but - by stretching a point - might possibly be allowed to send a communication through us to the Persian Gevernment• The oognaf© question.of course, arises as to wh&amp;t should be the channel of communication between the Persian Government and the Rulers in the matter of permission or notice ( see paragraph 10 below ). 1 imagine that this would have to be throujh us again, as to allow independent communications between the Persian authorities and the Arab 'lulcr© - even on a single specific subject sent as Movements of ships - would be undesirable. 10. the crux of the situation would appear to be the Persian claim to Bahrain, and I am. of corn's© fully alive to the serious considerations brought forward on this point at the conference by the representative of the Foreign Office, as also that the Persian Government might regard our insistence on a control over the visits of these gunb --ats the t©/Arabian coast as a species of retaliation, ami in reply mahe themselves obnoxious at Hen jam and elsewhere. But-I venture to suggest * would it not be possible to wrap up our request to the Persian Government in such a way as to show that no retaliation was intended ? Could we not say that on the basis of mutual co-operation in the Gulf of the two Bavies - British and Persian (1) - a Mutual knowledge of the movements of each other’s ships was necessary, and that just as British war-ships warned Persian authorities ©f their visits to Persian waters so prim facie there was nothing unreasonable in the request that fersian war-ships should do the earn© by the Arab Rulers ? ( This is more or less on the lines of a suggestion made by Colonel Biscoe at the Conference except that his views were in favour of ’permission’ not 1 notice’)• Wm could add - if this were thought advisable - that •«*that as a matter of practice even H,E»Ships did n t enter Arab ports without warning- the local Political Agent who passed the information to the I uler. If we argued on these lines then we might have to give way on the letter of ’permission^ and merely insist on ’notice’ • the latter is not as strong as the former of course, tut at any rate it would (a) preclude any claim of Persian sovereignty to the Arab coast $ (b) prevent surprise visits $ (c) regularise the situation.

Sir, With reference to your letter No* PZ 4709/31 of the 28th July, enclosing the minutes of an inter-Departmental conference held at the India Office on July 20th to consider the situation created hy the purchase hy the Persian Government of gun-boats for service in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the Marqiiess of Heading to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran on this subject, written before Mr. Dodd had received the record of that meeting. 2. Mr. Dodd puts forward tentatively a new suggestion, i.e. that, in order to guard against the danger of Persian aggression or interference of the nature referred to above. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should address to the Persian Government a formal warning, to which publicity might be given by sending a copy to the League of Nations, regarding the general political situation in the Gulf, and their own future attitude towards Persian aggression. He considers that such a warning might prevent the Persian Government from confronting His Majesty’s Government with a fait accompli , and subsequently pleading in their defence that His Majesty’s Government had not made their resolve clear The Under-Secretary of S tate Indifiu Office. J ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LE No. ^28 17 SEP, 1 FROM SEGRETARY, POUTSGAL AND SECRET DEPT, INDIA OFFICEclear to challenge and oppose any overt act tending to assert Persian sovereignty* Secretary or State is unable to approve the specific, suggestion advanced by Mr* Dodd* He doubts whether the communication to the Persian Government of such a warning as Mr* Dodd suggests would effectively deter them from any act of aggression which they might otherwise contemplate. The Persian Government are fully aware of the views held by His Majesty’s Government in regard to the position in the Persian Gulf. If then they were to take aggressive action against the subjects or territories of the Arabian rulers protected by His Majesty’s Government, e.g. against the island of Tamb, they would no doubt defend such action, not on the ground that there had been uncertainty as to the attitude of His Majestyfe Government but because the Persian Government themselves had always made their own attitude clear, and had frequently declared that such islands as Tamb were, in their view, Persian territory. Moreover, it is not clear how the warning suggested by Mr. Dodd could be so worded as not to provoke a violent and hostile reaction at Tehran, possibly leading to a premature re-opening of the question of the status of Bahrein, and of that of Tamb and Abu Musa, apart from the danger that it would be likely to precipitate reprisals by the Persian Government at Henjam or against the Political Resident at Bushire. Again, the warning, in order to be an , effective deterrent against Persian aggression, would have to amount to something in the nature of a threat; but in practicepractice His Majesty’s Government might find themselves unable to take effective action against Persian aggression, particularly if that aggression were gradual and cumulative. His Lordship is therefore not prepared to make a threat which in point of fact it might not he possible to carry into effect© 4. The Secretary of State thinks, however, that some steps should be taken to reduce the risk of unfortunate incidents occurring after the arrival in the Gulf of the new Persian Navy© The ships will at first depend entirely upon their Italian officers, who will be in the service of the Persian Government, and will have to obey any direct orders issued by that government. It is unlikely, however, that the Persian Government will go so far as definitely to instruct the Italian officers in their service to provoke an incident, and these officers may in practice be allowed a considerable measure of discretion. It is more likely that the Persian Government will endeavour to take advantage of the officers* ignorance of the Gulf situation, which they would naturally misrepresent to conform to their own pretensions, and thus allow incidents to occur without assuming direct and specific responsibility therefor. His Lordship proposes therefore to approach the Italian Government confidentially on the subject, with a view to ensuring that the Italian officers in Persian service in the Gulf shall confidentially be informed in advance by their own Government of the real situation in the Gulf. I am to enclose the draft of a despatch whichHis Lordship is addressing on this subject to His Majesty’s Charge d 1 Affaires at Rome. 5.

Mr. Dodd to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received Auqust 6 .) (No. 386.) ' v Sir, _ ‘ Tehran, July 23, 1931. WITH reference to Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No . 329 of-t he 25th June on the subject of the future Persian navy, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of Bushire despatches of the 26th May and the 17th June, with enclosures, on the same subject. The reference in despatch No. 329 to additional correspondence between the Acting Political Resident and the senior naval officer was due to a misunderstanding, and with the documents now enclosed the correspondence will be seen to be complete. 2. The subject is largely of a technical nature, and I do not feel myself competent to add any detailed observations of value to those already made so fully by the two principal experts on the spot. I would merely draw your attention to the special and unwelcome problem which would be presented in an acute form if one or more of these Persian naval units were to visit Bahrein. They might even be used for the purpose of giving effective form to Persian claims to sovereignty over Tamb and Abu Musa. It will be recalled that the Island of Sirri, whose history, till 1887, w T as identical with that of Tamb and Abu Musa,, has, since that date, been subject to Persian control for no better reason than that the Persian Government of that time, though far more feeble than now, and possessing no navy of any kind, decided to occupy and present His Majesty’s Government with a fait accompli. The proposal for a lease of Tamb made by the Minister of Court last October (see Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 5 26 of the 28th October, 1930), which would have implied Arab sovereignty, wasHTropped as soon as it was made. It may have been seen to have been a false move, and when it was mentioned to me by the head of the English section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 12 th instant, the latter was disavowed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs the next day (see my telegram No. 149 of the 13th instant). It may perhaps be argued that such contingencies are unlikely, and that the Persian Government may be trusted to avoid a situation so obviously fraught with the gravest possibilities of trouble. Be that as it may, I feel that, in view of the recent trend of Anglo-Persian relations, it would be unwise wholly to ignore such an eventuality. The Minister of Court has of late displayed a markedly defiant attitude where foreign relations are concerned, and it must be borne in mind that the ships now being built will in reality have no other raison d'etre than the assertion of Persia’s imagined rights in the Gulf. Caution and political good sense are not conspicuous features of the new Persia, and the desire to damage British prestige among the Gulf Arabs is undoubtedly strong. 3 . I consider, therefore, that it would be only prudent to decide now the policy best calculated to forestall eventual trouble; and I venture, accordingly, to suggest that, as soon as it is clear that a Persian fleet is, in fact, to be reckoned with in the Persian Gulf, a definite warning should be given to the Persian Government, and that it should be communicated to the Feague of Nations. Its terms will, of course, require very careful deliberation, and I understand that you will have the opportunity of discussing the question with Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe, who, from his intimate experience of conditions, is naturally best qualified to inform you of all its local aspects. It will be necessary to decide, in framing that warning, whether it suits the policy of His Majesty’s Government that Persian warships should be allowed to visit Arab waters at all, and, if so, in what conditions. Due regard will have to be paid to the probable repercussions of that decision upon the attitude of the Persian Government to the visits of His Majesty’s ships to Persian ports. The danger appears to be that the Persian Government, either deliberately or through sheer blundering, may force the issue of the disputed sovereignty. If this dispute must unavoidably be brought to a head, it will, I suggest, be advantageous to His Majesty’s Government not to [227 f— 3 ] ' b(2 2 allow the Persian Government to come before the public forum with a fait accompli, pleading that His Majesty’s Government had not made clear their resolve to challenge and oppose any overt act tending to assert Persian sovereignty. 4 . This question of sovereignty in Arab waters is one in which Persian amour-propre is deeply involved. It may perhaps not be inapposite to remind you that recently the Persian frontier guards started to build a fortified post some 300 yards within Iraq territory. It was just a mistake, as far as I am re present aware. But there was no immediate withdrawal when the mistake was pointed out. Orders from the Shah personally were required to stop the building. A commission had to be sent to the spot by the Persian Government to verify the encroachment. Presumably, after such verification, the garrison will be withdrawn; but at the moment of writing I have received no information that the incident is finally closed. I mention this merely to show that, even in a case where amour-propre is not specially inflamed, an incident of this kind requires very careful handling where Persians are concerned, if trouble is to be avoided. Where amour-propre has already got the better of reason, as in the case of the Persian pretensions in Arab waters, the only safe policy is to ensure so far as may be possible, that incidents do not occur at all. I consider that a timely warning is less likely to provoke the Persian Government into creating an incident in order to enforce their claims than to move them merely to reaffirm their point of view, as they have often affirmed it before. Such peaceful reaffirmation would not worsen the situation for His Majesty’s Government. 5.

For your information I am forwarding a copy of a letter, dated the 26th May, 1931, which I have myself addressed to his Excellency the Naval Commander-in-chief on this subject. It is requested that copies may be transmitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. 3. Wifh reference to paragraph 4 of my letter, I have now been advised that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s floating dock at Abadan is capable of docking the small motor patrol vessels. Enquiries have been instituted to ascertain whether the resources of the company are such that tne general refit work of these vessels could be undertaken at regular intervals. 4. The two gunboats could not be docked at Abadan. Generally speaking, vessels of this class in modern navies are docked twice in each year, during one docking period a general refit of the ship should be undertaken. It is quite possible that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company might be in a position to take m hand some repair work, but it is, of course, impossible to repair under-water fittings, unless vessels proceed into a dry dock. It is clear therefore that thqugn the Persians might dispense with the half-yearly docking, they cannot omit to dock the vessels at intervals of approximately one year, if the efficiency of material is to be maintained at a reasonable level. The docking and general overhaul combined would put the ships out of action for at least a month or, more likely, six weeks. The nearest ports with adequate docking facilities for these two vessels are Karachi and Bombay. , ^ . , . . 5. In Colonel Biscoe’s letter it is suggested that the Persian authorities are disposed to base their ships at Bushire. There is no doubt that Bushire is m a more central position than Mohammerah for the prevention of smuggling along the Persian Coast, but the port has many disadvantages. For example, the ships bottoms will become more foul if they lie at Bushire; so far as is known there are no facilities there for replenishing the ships with fuel; Bushire would be more inconvenient as a storing port; it is an exposed anchorage and the port is [227 f—3] B 24 relatively more unhealthy than Mohammerah On the other hand, Mohammerah suffers from the disadvantage that the control of the Shatt-al-Arab is vested in buiieib \ ,1 i • Kr, nrymnp pH to navigate a considerable differs from tne disaavantage tucit “ • j lr m Trao and so the ships would be compelled to navigate a considerable stretch of Tran waters before they could anchor in Persian waters There is an expression o oVmon “ E .

Of course if the right of innocent passage through Iraq waters was recognised expressly or by implication no great incon venience would arise, for the public status of these vessels would entitle them to enioy certain privileges (ibid, p. 345, et seq). But however carefully the position* was regulated no one could recommend as a naval base any port from which free egress to the open sea is no guaranteed under all circumstances. 5 6 '. Whilst discussing the position as it affects Mohammerah it may be remarked that there is always a possibility that if Iraq raised any objection to freedom of navigation of warships in the Shatt, the Persians might retaliate by raising; the question of the frontier, and it is conceivable that they might point to the fact that much of the Rooks Channel itself is in Persian territorial waters. It would seem desirable, therefore, that the Persian Government be encouraged to base their ships at Bushire rather than at Mqhammerah, so as to avoid any question of their raising these points when the ships do arrive. 7. To return to Bushire, perhaps Sir Robert Clive might be interested in the following remarks :— (a) Mean draught:— Motor patrol vessels : 5 ft. 8 in. Gunboats : 9 ft. 11 in. (b) Motor patrol vessels and gunboats can use the inner anchorages at all states of the tide. (c) There is a bar—called the Lakfa Sand—with f fathom on it between the inner anchorage and the deep water alongside Bushire town. Once across this bar there is ample water for both types of ships at all states of the tide. (d) The motor patrol vessels would require 1J ft. rise above datum and the gunboats 6 ft. to cross this flat. (d) Ability to cross the Lakfa Sand is roughly as follows : — 8.

For several months these days are very tew, and for about three months they do not occur at all. The motor patrol vessels can use the anchorage off the town throughout the year, and it is really only at low-water springs that they would not have enough water. The draught given is “ Tirant d’eau moyen.” If this really means the mean draught it is probable that the maximum draught would be something like 2 ft. more, which would considerably reduce the mobility of the ships in Bushire harbour. 8 . In regard to the question of the interchange of the customary inter national courtesies when British and Persian naval forces happen to meet, I would refer the Political Resident to the Admiralty for full information on the subject. Actually, the rules laid down have been agreed upon by the great maritime Powers generally and are printed in the King’s Regulations and Admiralty Instructions. In my opinion, however, it would be more satisfactory that any information required on this matter should be supplied by the home departments direct to the Political Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Minister so that a definite and authoritative ruling could be said to have come through the proper channels. 9. It would be appreciated very much if any further information which comes to hand concerning this new navy could be passed to me immediately, so that details may be passed to the Commander-in-chief without delay.

Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station. (Secret.) May 26, 1931. DURING my recent visit to Bushire from the 22 nd to the 24th May, I discussed in a general way, with the honourable the Political Resident, questions relating to the establishment of a Persian sea-going naval force in the Gulf. 2. The Political Resident informs me that he himself lacks information on the whole subject, though he has learned that in this year’s budget a sum stated to be about £250,000 has been appropriated for the building programme. If this is true, it seems that the reports already received that the ships are due to be completed towards the end of this year must be taken seriously. 3. I suggested to the Political Resident that the advent of a Persian naval force raises question of some importance ; he agreed, and expressed the view that the time had now arrived when we both would be well advised to seek instructions from our respective superiors. 4. It is difficult for me at this juncture to forecast what problems will actually arise, for there is very little information upon which to work. For example, we do not know what provision has been made for docking and repairs, for fuel requirements, nor do we know whether the ships will be officered or manned by Italian or Persian personnel. I have heard that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been approached with a request that their small floating dock might be made available for docking the ships, but I also understand that the dock is not large enough. 5. A few years ago it might have been safe to assume that a Persian navy would seldom, if ever, put to sea, particularly as no repair facilities can be said to exist beyond those which might be provided by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but to-day Persia is in a very different way, at least for the moment, and is ruled by men who are inclined to sweep away difficulties and who like to see results, even though the results achieved are of little practical value. In these circum stances, it would be most unwise to assume that newly-completed ships will not be employed at sea when they first arrive.W* 6 6 . I would submit to your consideration the following points which are put forward tentatively as a basis for enquiry : (a) If the ships use or propose to use Hen jam, what should be the attitude of the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf ? (b) Similarly, if the Persians wish their ships to make use of the anchorage off British Basidu. (c) When Persian vessels are met with in any port or on the high seas, it i presumed that the customary international courtesies will bV exchanged. They may be quite ignorant of procedure in this respect, and questions of seniority and status might well arise, even if the vessels are manned by Italians, for officers lent to a foreign navy might be considered as having lost the status and seniority they enjoy in their own service. (d) The Persian ships might be sent to cruise along the Trucial and Batineh coasts, they might want to visit Bahrein, Koweit and Doha; it k quite likely that the Government will want to show their ships to the Arabs. (e) They may go in for cruises on the Pearl Banks and may possibly interfere with Arab dhows on the high seas. (/) It seems important, too, that an organisation should be set up for reporting the movements of Persian ships direct to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, so that their activities can be watched. 7. Some guidance as to the policy to be followed in regard to the various points raised, and in regard to others which will almost certainly be raised in a discussion of the whole question, would be particularly useful, for I believe that much will depend upon whether or not the position during the first year or so after the arrival of the vessels in the Gulf is handled in a careful systematic manner. It is also important, in my view, that every effort should be made to acquire information as to the ships and details of thie administration proposed for them. L. E.

The latest developments are set out in Sir Robert Clive f s despatch of 2 r th June on P.Z. 4545/31, from which it will be seen that the four small patrol vessels are expected to be ready towards the end of the present year, but that the two gunboats of 1,000 tons cannot be ready before the spring of 1932. The question of the attitude t o be adopted in regard to these ships, with partic ular reference to the danger of aggression by them against the Sheikhs of the Arab littoral of the Gulf and to the procedure to be adopted in respect of demands that they should be allowed to visit Arab ports, was discussed at an inter departmental meeting on 20th July, at which the Political Resident was present. Minutes of the discussion are attached. It will be seen tl ., r nij — general agreement that it would be desirable, i~ possible, to impose limitations on the freedom of access of the new r-hips to the ports of the Arab littoral of the Gulf and of Bahrein, it seemed doubtful whether any action could profitably be taken at the present time, owing to the danger of retaliation at Hen jam and the impossibility' of securing Persian concurrence in an agreement^to govern intimation or the grant of permission^which would cover Bahrein. The general conclusion was that for the moment there is.nothing to be done but to wait on events and keep a sharp lookout for any Persian aggression or interference/f ■ Mi interference. It is of course quite possible that we may be disturbing ourselves unnecessarily, and that in practice tr Persian ships will be likely to confine themselves to their own side of the Gulf. The Resident did not in any case think that they were at all likely to visit Bahrein (though the other members of the conference thought it quite possible that the Persian Government might seize the opportunity of nrevoking an incident of a difficult character by instructing one of the ships to call there). As regards Koweit, the Resident foresaw no difficulty, : while on the Trucial Coast he mentioned that he could give instructions that the Persians should not be allowed to lan [ and that none of the Sheikhs should come off to visit them. It was very improbable that the Commander of one of these Persian ships would himself go on shore to nay the first \i:.:iu ^0 one cm the Trucial Sheikhs. The*situation is not al^ogeonor satisfactory, but it is difficult to see what we can do at this stage beyond await developments , Copies of the minutes o^ the meeting have been [sent to the Government of Indm who might ^ dac oouroc be .asked for their observations.

BITOATIQI CRCAfEO BY PARSIM PURQHAJE OF GHB-BOAX 3 MJ^mohYmMhs M/Liigr i '5Y r ‘iTAjbi^'cii^ MhvicI m giji^', Mr. laithwaite said that the Persian Government had ordered from Italy two gunboats of about 1,000 tons and four smaller patrol vessels, to he manned by Persians with a I sprinkling of Italian officers. The gunboats, according to I the latest information, would not he ready before next April. The patrol vessels were expected to he ready for delivery by the end of the present year. It was clear that the acquisition of these craft would ere te a new situation in the Gulf, and it seemed desirable to consider without further delay our general attitude in regard to these ships, with particular reference to the danger of aggression by them against the Sheikhs oi the Arab littoral of the Gulf and to the procedure to be adopted in respect of demands that they should be allowed to visit Arat&gt; Certain tentative proposals made by the Acting 0^:3*? s fs- Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had already been circu- tlTTf- -f l. lated to the Departments interested. Colonel Biscoe said that in his view it would be extremely undesirable politically to allow these vessels to visit the ports of the various Arab sheikhs without permission. H# suggestedIthat the simplest solution of the diffloulty mi^ht h# that w# should accept the Persian demand that E*M, Ships in tiie Persian Gulf should not in future riait Persian ports, other than Henjaat and nbadan, without first obtaining permission from Tehran, (our position at Hen jam was quite special and we would perhaps be justified in asking for special treatment there $ while at Abadan he understood that ships could refuel if necessary in the river in Iraq, territory, and the question of permission might not therefore arise). In Ms opinion we should in this event be in a position to demand adoption of a reciprocal procedure by the Persians in respect of their visits to the Ports on the Arab littoral. :r.Hancock said that the .Maml 3taff had been reluctant, if this could in at# way be avoided, to agree to any procedure under whi ch a fomal request to the Persian Government for permission** for the visit of ships sh©aid be made. The difficulty was, however, perhaps one of words rather than of eubetanee, since the Admiralty had recently intimated that if necessary they were prepared to agree to prior notification and in normal circumstances to ask for Persian concurrence in the visits of ships before actually entering their ports, except in ih# case of Hen jam, Abadan, Kharag and Bushire. Mr. .Beadel pointed out that at the present time the general negotiations with Persia had been suspended; our relations with her were far from satisfactory; and it was impossible to say how the situation might develop* we were not in a position to ask Persia for any favours, nor was it perhaps likely that any opportunity would offer in the immediate future, unless negotiations were resumed, of broaching with them again the question of a reciprocal procedure in connection with the visits of ships. In any case, however, there was considerable risk that the Persians might regard our action in applying a procedure such as that now suggested in the case of the Arab ports as a species of retaliationv 4\v) retaliation against them# It must be remembered that if we made oursei?fts objectionable, even in small ways, the Persians were in a strong position to make our position difficult elsewhere in the Gulf, perhaps notably at Henjmu This was particularly the case as it was hardly to be expected that the Italian, officers in charge of the new ships would not in the near future discover the advantages of Hen jam as a harbour and as a naval base# .f.alonei Mscop thought this an excellent reason for considering transfer of our present station at Henjam to Bahrein, where we should have nothing to fear from the Persians# He suggested, however, that it mi$it be possible to wrap up our request to the Persians for formal notice of the visits of Paraian ships to Arab ports in some form of words. He suggested that the agreement with the Persians mad only be an oral one# Hr# ilandel said that he foresaw very great difficulty in this# It was unlikely that the Persians would be content with an oral agreement, and even if they were, this would probably be of little value to us in an emergency. But in any event, the Persians might well question our right to speak on behalf of the Rulers of the Arab coast* Ivan assuming that this could be got over, they would almost certainly * and not unnaturally - reouire a list of the ports in respect of which prior permission would have to be obtained before visits could b© mid# This would inevitably include Bahrain, and there was no hop®, in present circunstances, of persuading the Persians to enter into any agreement, oral or written, which formally treated Bahrein as not being subject to Persian nuserainty* In reply to a question by Mr* Laithwaite said that our special treaty relations with the rulers of the Arab Coast, which had been formally recognised e.g. in our treaties with Ibn Baud, were such, he thought, as to put us in a strong position internationallyif challer^ged m to our light to spd&amp;k on bahalf of th© rulers of the Arab littoral* H# added tfmt Persia had nay or gave very indirectly challenged our position in Kowiit.

In the case of Bahrein the views of both parties had been imd# abundantly clear internationally. .^bkmLthat he doubted very mich J the Para Ians would in fact be likely to send their ship® t© Bahrein. The meeting, however, was inclined to the view that the risk that they iiught do ao could not he overlooked, md that in this event there be darker of an incident in the event of their doing so. Altar considerable further discussion, Mr&gt; hauthwaite said that xt seemed clear that, especially now that negotiations had been suspended, we were not in a strong position to broach again with the Persian Government the ipmral puaatian of procedure in connection with the visits of rduoe. The India Office were disposed to agree with the Resident as to the objections to allowing visits of Persian ships to Arab ports without prior notification, hut the difficulties foreseen by the Foreign Office, mm particularly in connection with Bahrein, could not be ignored. On the whole, the best course pH©babiy would b# to adopt a waiting policy and t#§ how the situation developed. In tns event of a decision to rswiove the l aval base f ns® Esnj^s to Bahrain, wc should bs ®ors independent of Persia and might perhaps fii^-s ourselves able to taka s stronger lino wi^h her over this om at ion. The discussion than turned to the possibility that the Persian ships mipfai interfere with Arab dhows in the Gulf Mr. haith ^a ^te said that the Persians could legitimately start, 1 dhows far c pnlj^M only in Persian territorial waters, thoum. in/&gt; I ^ in tii# oast of m i si and such as Tansb # to which they had a claim t they t of course # assort that a belt of Persian territorial waters extended around it.

I think on this subject it will be best to let the discussion develop generally. Much must depend on the points raised by the Resident and the views expressed by him. We may at any rate succeed in clearing some of the ground in conversation. Before any final recommendation cold be made to higher authority it would, of course, be necessary to ascertain the Government of India’s views, which have not yet been received. The Foreign Office further consider that the ultimate decision should be taken in the Middle Fast Sub-Commit tee. Removall Removal of the Naval base from Heniam to Bahrein .- Thie is not a matter in which the India Office is very directly concerned. As regards the possible adverse effect of removal on our prestige, we agreed, I think, yesterday that provided we could go in our own time and on our own terms this need not ibe feared. An adverse effect would only be probable if we fa, hU. 4 It *vt WVH. ve&lt;-w, £ Jvi* l / hrfiit, /) J (rM ' were + 0 turned out by the Persians.

Li^iitinr: an d -ucvir.. in the__P_exsian Gulf-- Colonel Biscoe has expressed his desire to discuss this question. He has not indicated precisely what points he wants to raise. It will be remembered that the question was brought prominentj.y 1 to the front in connection with the treaty negotiations. f e it that the Persians would probably insist on being responsible (or at any rate on being associated with the arrangements) for limiting and buoying in their own territorial m ters, and we were anxious to devise some scheme which, while giving them the appearance of responsibility, -'ould retain the substance in our own hands. The alternative schemes proposed were - (a) that the Conservancy Board contemplated for trie Shatt-el-Arab should be made responsible for lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf generally; ( b ) that consMiMnoy z-hcreld be dealt lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf bein- entrusted to two Boards, the first, composed of BritishJj/: ywwf 'PiTu^' and buoys on the Persian littoral; the second, composed of the same British President and two Arab members, to deal with lights and buoys on the Arab side.'C_ : •’K O The Croveranent of India and the Resident were definitely opposed to (a), on the ground of the danger of Persia using her position as a member to interfere v/iththe Arab Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf, They were also alive to the danger of a possible combination of the Persian and Iraqi representatives against us which might have embarrassing results on the Arab side. In these circumstances Colonel Biscoe suggested, and the Government of India supported, course (b). I submit that I might in general stand on this ground in the discussion. Apart from the question of the actual organisation to be devised for discharging these duties, there was the question of the arguments to be used to persuade the Persians either to acquiesce in the retention by us of responsibility for lighting and buoying in their territorial waters as their agents, or alternatively to agree to the two-decker system. On this there has been considerable discussion of a rather detailed nature, the arguments recommended by Colonel Ward having been controverted by Colonel discos, who is supported by the S.N.O. and the Admiralty, but on whose views we have not i yet received the Ciovernrnent of India's comments. The Government of India are probably unlikely to disagree with the Resident, and if this question should come up for discussion we might with the Admiralty lend him a general support, subject to a caveat that India have still to express themselves. The question has lost much of its urgency since it is closely associated with the dormant treaty negotiations and is -unlikely to be revived actively -until some progres^is^made with them. But it is of course desirable to get clear/STTo' what arrangements we really want 1fJa^^rther communitatipi^on thisfsubject, please quafc e&amp;r No. PjlM hztM ^ ■ and address —not to any person py name, lilt to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i.

His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Ina^a , IHDIA QRFICB,Confidential Ho,63/293-S of 1931. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, BuaMre, the 26th I4ay 1931 , Sir, I hare the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential despatch Ho*67 of the 16th May 1931, regarding two gunboats and four motor patrol vessels being built in Italy for service in the Persian Gulf, 2 , X have communicated the information which you have supplied to me to the ienior Haval Officer, and have asked for his technical opinion on the possibility of docking these vessels, and his views will be communicated to you as soon as received; meanwhile however, as I am leaving in a few days* time, I submit my views for what they may be worth. 3 # The motor patrol boats could certainly enter Bushire harbour without difficulty; the gunboats could, I think, also do so, though they would doubtless have to await high tide,etc. Moreover the fairway is exceedingly narrow and if several of these vessels were there at the same time it would probably be very difficult for them to get in or out. Docking facilities there are none at Bushire, but probably the motor patrol boats could be docked in the Angio-Persian Oil Company dry dock at Abadan; the Britannic Majesty* e Minister, British Legation, Xetiran,the gunboats could not, I think, be docked nearer than Karachi or Bombay, but I am asking the Senior JSTaval Officer whether this is correct. Speaking as a layman it seems to me that the obylous place really to put these vessels is ^©hammerah 5 they would lie in fresh water and thus fouling of their bottoms would be greatly reduced and it would probably suffice to dock them once a year instead of once every six months, and there would be of course greater facilities for refuelling and carrying out repairs, etc* as no doubt the hngl©.Persian Oil Company would be ready to assist them to some extent with the extensive resource® at their disposal. However apparently this somewhat obvious base does not commend itself to the Persian authorities.

Clive (Tehran). Foreign Office, September 18th 1930. 10.15 p.nu No.187. Your telegram No. 163 (of July Mth. Persian • Navy)* You should he guided during the forthcoming visit to Tehran of the Senior Naval Officer by the following considerations. His Majesty’s Government would, in principle, be prepared to assist the Persian government in the development and training of their new navy* The position is, however, complicated by the absurd demands recently advanced by the Persian government in connexion with the withdrawal of their claim to Bahrein, The enquiry in the Persian letter of August 9th whether, as compensation on this account, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to present them with aeroplanes, seaplanes and warships, and agree to educate Persian naval and air cadets free of charge for twenty-five years is grotesque, and at suitable moment you may let Persian Ministers concerned know that it is so regarded. A further complication is the discourteous manner in which His Majesty’s Government were treated last year when Teymourtache, havinghaving deliberately given you the impression that he was asking ior British assistance both in the acquisition of ships and the loan of British officers, arranged for the purchase of his requirements in Italy without even informing you that British assistance was no longer required. In these circumstances it is not the moment to come forward with an offer of assistance, and if any further Persian proposal is linked with the Bahrein claim it should be emphatically rejected. If 0 however, the general atmosphere at Tehran ware to change for the better the general lines on which His Majesty’s Government might assist Persia are the following (a) Assistance in engaging suitable British naval officers* Persians would have first to submit satisfactory written proposals regarding conditions of service* (b^ Training of a few naval cadets in British navy. Such cadets who should be about 18 years of age should have sufficient knowledge of the English language to enable them to benefit from the instruction course. As regards (a) it seems doubtful whether the Persian government really wish to engage British officers* They may have already decided to engage Italians 0 As regards (b) the Admiralty are not &amp;nzicus to train Persian cadets 5 but would agree to do so if at some later stage you consider this likely to3. to have a decisive effect in your negotiations. You will realise that to show great readine to assist the Persian government after what has occurred might only he interpreted by them as a sign of weakness and also of nervousness on the part of His Majesty’s Government as to the increasing activities of Italy in Persian naval affairs*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00012f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3738</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00012f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3738</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/24 'Persia and Persian Gulf, Persian Navy.
