It is suitable for all marine purposes where a strong and serviceable hand-pump is required. No. 8. No. 8. Standard Merchant Service Pattern, as illustrated. Made in best brass or gunmetal, with iron working gear, and mounted on strong wooden chock or backboard. No. 9. As No. 8, but fitted with air vessel and draw-off cock. These Pumps have been recently re-designed, with a shorter stroke. In the older pattern the stroke of the pump was so long that the operator was unable to take advantage of it. By reducing the maximum stroke to that which can be effectually used, a pump of less overall length has been produced without any sacrifice of capacity. The saving in material has enabled us to produce a high-class pump at a reduced price. [P.T.O.illllilHIIIIHIIIHIIIIIilllllllllllllllllUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIO I No. 10. No. 10.

Like the ' Torfreda ,' tliis is also modelled on our original pattern of under-line W.C. It is, however, a cheaper type, and is largely used for crews' quarters. It is made in j^ood quality brass, with a white earthenware basin enclosed in a cast-metal container. The valves are of larg'e area, and specially constructed, making it practically impossible for the closet to become choked. It is fitted with two non-return valves, so that sea-water cannot leak back into the basin. This W.C. has been supplied for use on board ships and yachts in many parts of the world, and is deservedly popular on account of its robust construction and reliability. No. 61.

The ' Midget ' has been introduced specially for use on small yachts, motor launches and other craft where only the minimum of space is available. It is suitable for fixing either above or below the waterline. The pump functions as a double-acting- pump, flushing- the basin and simultaneously discharging the contents. At the same time, when fixed under-line there is always a free water supply, which can be regulated as required. This W.C. is now fitted with a vertical pump handle, which is a great improvement on the horizontal pattern. It is considerably easier No. 61 A. No. 61C. to operate, and at the same time obviates any need of stooping over the closet pan. I he horizontal handle can, however, be fitted where special conditions make it desirable. 5PKCIFICAT10N.

This new type of yacht W.C. illustrated is the outcome of a considerable amount of thought and experience, the object being to produce a W.C. that was adaptable or universal to any position on a boat. We claim for these two designs that they will function equally well either above, below or on the line. We have named these ' Universal Major ' and ' Universal Minor.' They are admirably suitable for small or large craft. They are simple in design and easy to operate, having only one handle. Another advantage is they are foolproof. They occupy a minimum of space, which is important when, as a rule, there is none too much to spare. They are fitted with an oval pan and seat, which is a decided advantage over the ordinary round type. The price, too, is reasonable when you consider the advantages, workmanship and general finish.
