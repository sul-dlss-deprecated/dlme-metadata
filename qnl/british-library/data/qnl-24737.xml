The files discuss the Commission's proposed functions on regulating trade and traffic at the Shatt al Arab estuary, but mostly discuss the governing conventions of the Commission and its independence from local Turkish Authorities.The correspondence is mainly between British authorities at the India Office and various British diplomatic missions writing from the capitals of the various European powers involved in talks on the establishment of the Commission in question. Significantly, the papers discuss the possibility of internationalising the Shatt al Arab waterway. However, in view of the fact that the Ottoman claim to the waterway was indisputable, British authorities opted for stronger Imperial Ottoman rather than local Ottoman control over the Commission's activities so as to ostensibly ensure fair treatment of international vessels navigating the Shatt al Arab.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Canal navigation and inland waterways legislation</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shatt al Arab</geographic></subject><subject><topic>River navigation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000a5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
