Educational Affairs (Supplied by the Education Department) 4. This week we want to write a few words on the subject of the Gowern- ment’s Technical School at Manamah. W' » ; _ About a year—and—a—half ago, complaints were made to the Government, by a section of the public, about employment with the Oil Company. Those who complained said that most of its well-paid posts were being given by the Company to foreigners, instead of to Bahrainis. The Government, in reply, pointed out that since very few of the young men of Bahrain were possessed of the necessary training to qualify them for well-paid work with an oil company, the Bahrain company had been forced, against its own wishes, to offer the posts to well-qualified foreigners. - Bu t Government did not allow the matter to rest there. They dis- th 0 matter with the Oil Company, and an understanding was reached, that the Oil Company would always give preference to a Bahraini, as against a foreigner, provided that both were equally well qualified for the post. The Government had already, before this time, opened a technical school at Manamah, the chief purpose of which was to give Bahrain boys a short train ing, of a kind which would enable them to become candidates for well-paid crit posts at the Awali, or in other^companies, or with technical or engineering firms. By establishing this technical school, and by obtaining this understand ing with the Oil Company, the Government did everything in its power towards assisting the young men of Bahrain to obtain good and well-paid posts. It even offered to pay the Technical School students a wage of 15 rupees per month during the whole period of their course of training, and this paymentis still being iaade # to every student at the School. a- But in spite of these efforts by the Government, the Technical School has not been as successful as it could have been, because the boys from the highest classes in the Government schools are shoving themselves unwilling to enter it. The main cause of their unwillingness, we are told, is that they imagine that there is some sort of indignity about working with one 1 s hands, and this idea makes them think it better to try to find posts in Gov ernment or other offices. This idea about the indignity of manual work is a very misguided one, ' several reasons. First, there is nothing in any way shameful about work ing with one’s hands : all the great modern engineers - men who are now rich and famous - began their careers either as boys in technical schools or as simple mechanics in great engineering works, and even after their technical training was finished, and they were earning high salaries as fully-qualified engineers, they were never ashamed to be seen working with their hands. Sec ond, while posts in Government offices are very few, technical posts are many Third, any young man who has received a little technical training can earn twice or three times as much money as a clerk can earn in an office. Let us give a local example of the high wages which can be earned by who are possessed of a little technical training. During the past week we have sent to the Awali three Bahrain Government schoolboys to work as learner-beginners at the oil-camp. None of these boys is over 19 years of age, and none of them has spent more than 18 months at the Technical School, yet each of them is to receive a commencing wage of 60 rupees per month, although they are still unskilled learners. If they do well, thsir monthly wages in six months’ time will be at least 100 rupees, and there is practic ally no limit to what a man may rise to, in the service of an oil-company, if he proves himself a reliable and hard-working employee. We do not blame the schoolboys for holding foolish ideas about the shamefulness of manual work, for boys cannot be expected to have sensible ideas in their heads unless sensible ideas have first been put there by their parents and by their schoolmasters. In our view, it is the duty of allliorernment schoolmasters to teach their boys that manual work is just as noble and just as dignified as any other kind of work ; and to draw their attention to the great opportunities which are awaiting Bahrain schoolboys who will sub mit themselves to a short period of training at the Government Technical School. Oil is now being found in many parts of the Gulf, and for many years to come there will be plenty of well-paid posts to be obtained : but such posts will be given only to those who have been trained for them, and as long as Bahrain boys refuse to be technically trained, the posts will continue to go to foreigners. For these reasons, we wish to ask parents, and to instruct schoolmasters, to^m-ry to bring about in the minds of their boys a more sensible frame of mind about manual work. As things are going at present, the Bahrain Government schoolboy* s road to success and to fortune lies through the portals of the Technical School, and not through the door of a Government office.'The Bahrain Newspaper', 1 February 1940• jfiducational Matters (Supplied by the iiducation Department) Last week we promised to give our readers the ten main reasons for the low standard of education in Bahrain. Here they are : (1) The first concerns attendance. Many of the boys attend irregu larly, coming to school one day and being absent the next, and boys cannot be properly taught as long as they are allowed to do this. Also there is ^ the schools a very bad custom of allowing new boys to Join at any time during the school year, instead of only at the beginning of it. In conse quence, the classes are always 'starting again at the beginning of the book’’ for the sake of the late newcomers. Finally, many of the boys leave school before their education is completed. (2) The second reason is that most of the classes in the schools are overcrowded. The first cause of overcrowding is that large numbers of in fants, who are too young to be at school at all, are sent there by parents whose only purpose is to get rid of their children for the greater part of the day. The second cause of overcrowding is that the headmasters arrange t^Jir classes in such a way that the top classes contain only about half- a-dozen boys, while the lower classes often contain more than a hundred. No master in the world can properly teach a class of a hundred boys. (S)The third renaon for the failure of Bahrain education is that the schoolmasters hare no idea at all of the enormous importance of the lowest classes, or of the wisdom of allotting the best masters to the youngest boys. Instead, the best roasters are all given to the highest classes, and any quite inexperienced young man is considered good enough to teach the infants. This is exactly the opposite of iSuropean practice, where the cleverest masters are always apportioned to the beginners, the European countries having discovered long ago that unless boys are given a sound foundation of knowledge during the first three years of their school lives, nothing much can be done for them when eventually they reach the higherclftspes. Higher education can only be built up on a sound foundation of lower education, and in Bahrain the very young boys receive practically no education at all* (4) The fourth reason is that the system of education in force in Bahrain has been copied from systems used in countries where the standard of education is not very high, because it is not based upon modern methods* Consequently, some of the methods of teaching which are used in the Bahrain schools are old-fashioned, and do not produce satisfactory results* ^ (5) The fifth weakness is that in all the schools pencils are used, instead of ink. The use of pencils by schoolchildren leads to untidiness, carelessness, and bad handwriting* In Europe the little children learn to write with ink from the very start of their education, and a pencil is never seen in a European school, except for the purpose of teaching Braving.^ An- other fault in the Bahrain schools is that many of the boys learn hgasi5!T±s±nr A especially English horn dwrifefrwg, by copying the (very bad) handwriting of A their teachers on the blackboards, instead of learning to write by using proper copy-books. (6) The sixth reason is that most of the schools of Bahrain are very t?\k. They se^m to have been designed for coolness, rather than for light, and the very small windows are nearly all in the wrong parts of the rooms* Lack of light leads to poor work, especially in Bahrain, where many of the children have poor eyesight* On dull days in winter it is difficult for the boys to see properly either the blackboards or their own exercise-books. (7) The seventh reason is that there exists at the schools a system of monthly expminations, which are continually interrupting and interfering with the normal work of the school year, and which are without much prac tical value* One, or at most, two examinations in the course of the year are quite sufficient for any school* Examinations are in no way essential to education, and in Europe many of the best schools hold no examinations at all, from the beginning of the school year to its end*y *4 ® t (t) The eighth reason for the low standard of education in Bahrain is the poor condition of the village schools, which are Just as important to the State us the town schools. At two of these village schools we found that there were no books at all, either to read out of or to write in, and the other village schools were not much better equipped. (9) The ninth reason is the poor health of many of the boys. There can be no sound education without sound health, and there can be no sound health of schoolchildren unless the/'teachers are prepared to interest them- .^Ives in it, and to supervise it. \ (10) The tenth, and the chief, cause of bad education in Bahrain is the lack of really good teachers. In all the Government schools combined we have not a single roaster who has completed his course and taken his degree at a modern university. Many of the masters employed are themselves not able to do much more than read and write. And not a single master on our list has attended a course at a Teachers* Training College. The above are the ten reasons which re promised to give, and they make rather sad reading. Next week we shall try to explain to our readers what the Education Department has done, is doing, and hopes to do in the future, to* rds removing these ten causes of poor education in Bahrain.t * ; y / i’’The Bahrain Newspaper8 February 1940. Educationeil Matters (Supplied by the Education Department) 3. Last week we described the ten main weaknesses of Bahrain education, and we promised to tell our readers what the Education Department is doing to remove them. ^ (1) Attendance. Regular attendance of schoolboys is, of course, a t/iing which can only be properly enforced by their own parents. It is most unwise to allow small boys to decide for themselves each day whether or not they shall go to school. Small boys have not sufficient wisdom to know what is good or what is bad for them. We therefore wish to ask all parents of Bahrain schoolboys to co-operate with us by insisting that their sons attend the schools regularly. In addition, we are asking all the schoolmasters to address their pupils frequently upon the importance of regular attendance, and upon the importance of remaining at school until their education has been completed. Next year, each of the schools will have a proper Attendance Officer, whose sole duty will be to look after the attendance of the boys. Th, e will also be a strict rule, after the end of the present year, that no boy can be admitted to a Government school at any time except at the beginn ing of the school year. Boys who attend irregularly will be asked to leave the school altogether. 1 &amp; \ (2 &amp; 3) Overcrowding, and neglect of infants* education. The whole of the infants' classes are to be taken away from kanamah and Muharraq Schools, and to be accomodated in completely separate schools. They are to be called Classes 1, 2, and 3. They will be taught by the best teachers we can find, and their course will last three years. In this way they will receive a very sound grounding of education, upon which their later education can be built^. The removal of the infants will at the same time solve the problem of over crowding which now exists at Manamah and Uuharraq Schools.6 (4) Antiquated methods# Modern methods of teaching are to be intro- duced, and those roasters who are unable or unwilling to adopt them will be asked to make room for abler men. (5) The use of pencils. A large quantity of school ink has been order ed, and as soon as it arrives the use of pencils will be forbidden, in all the schools. Also, all the boys will be taught to write, both in Arabic and in English, by the use of proper copybooks, under the instruction of teachers who really understand how to teach penmanship # since copy-books are ^ no value unless they are properly used. (6) Darkness of the schools. This will be overcome by the method of whitewashing the walls and the ceilings of all the classrooms which need it. This work has already been completed at Manamah School, and Muharraq is to be done next, then Hidd and the village schools. (7) Monthly examinations. These have be&gt;n abolished. (l) Neglect of the village schools. This has already been remedied. All the village schools have been properly cleaned, and each one now has a peon to keep it clean. All the village schools have been supplied with proper riding and writing books, and the boys have been given footballs to play with We are paying the village schools regular visits of inspection, and the ques tion of supplying them with better teaching is now being considered. A (9) Poor health of the boys. The Government has, long ago, supplied doctors and local dispensaries, and we are making it clear to the headmasters of the schools that it is a definite part of their duty to watch the health ol their pupils, and to see that when they are ill they make proper use of the available facilities^and ({tt thus receivUHf proper medical attention. Next year, this will be a part of the duties of the Attendance Officers, mentioned in (1). (10) Lack of good teaching. A number of really good teachers will be engaged at the beginning of the next school year. It is iropospible to en gage them at once, since at this time of the year nearly all really good men1 are already in posts, which they cannot leave until the end of the school year. We shall try to engage men with proper university degrees, good ex perience of teaching, and preferably with some training as teachers. Next week we want to write specially about the Technical School—'The Bahrain Newspaper', 25 January 1940. Educational Matters (Supplied by the Education Department) By the courtesy of the Editor of the Bahrain Newspaper, this column is to be set aside each week for the exclusive use of the Government’s Education De partment. This is a very good arrangement, for three reasons. First, it will enable the Government to keep the public informed of what it is doing in the sphere of education. Second, it will give the public an opportunity of help ing the Education Department to make a success of its efforts to improve Gov ernment education in Bahrain. Third, it will prevent the spread of inaccurate —about educational matters. Ne are sure that every person in Bahrain wishes and hopes to see education in the Island greatly improved. But education in Bahrain can only be improved if the public, and especially the parents, are prepared to give their full support and co-operation to the Education Department. Further, before we can begin to improve anything we must first have a clear view of the existing state of affairs, and we must boldly face the facts, even if those facts are unpleas ant ones. The unpleasant fact which we hare to face in Bahrain is that the standard of education is very low indeed. When the schoolboys leare their schools, they possess only a poor knowledge of their own language, Arabic ; they can utter ^om,_ 1 few simple words in English ; their English handwriting is so bad as to be almost unreadable ; and their Arithmetic is so weak that no Bank or business __ /office is able to employ them. They know nothing at all of world history or world geography, since they hare been giren at school only a narrow riew of the history and geography of that part of the world which is inhabited by the Arabic-speaking peoples : and although they do receire this limited knowledge, ' they are left in complete ignorance of the history and the geography of their own country, and are unable eren to draw a simple map of the Island in which they lire. They receive at the schools practically no physical graining, and no training in character at all. finally, their health is poor, and health matters are completely neglected by the school authorities. Why is education in Bahrain so bad as we have described ? There main reasons, and these we shall discuss in this column next week. are tenConfidential &lt; c 9 i D.O. No. C/807-1.b/5 Dated the 6th December 1939. /''N Si ('ii Now that Vallance has arrived it may be expected that the re-organisation of Education in Bahrain will proceed apace. It may equally be expected that this re-organization will follow very much the lines of Vallance*s own report f and the Political Resident therefore desires me to draw your attention to certain aspects of that report where it is thought that caution is needed. 2. In the first place it is evident that if Vollance’s recommendations are to be put into effect more or less as they stand there must be very considerable expansion of the Education budget. It se ms essential therefore in the first instance to make an attempt to assess closely the immediate and future charges against the State Budget which may be involved in this re-organisation. I cannot help believing that such a review of anticipated expenditure will at onci3 show that some of Vallance* s recommendations must be abandoned or at least modified for the time being. For instance he recommends the appointment of attendance officers, of a special European doctor whose sole occupation would be work among children, of an Arab Mufettish in addition to the Director of Education and of a Hebrew teacher; he proposes the building of new Infants Schools in Manama, i-uharraq and Hedd, while there can be little doubt that his plane must lead to an extension of the Technical School; his recommendations in regard to Salaries will involve increased expenditure; and finally the suggestion that English should be taught in the village schools /- ' r C. Delrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.- 2 - y 0/0 f '* schools in the Second Stage cannot fail to add to costs. \ 3. It may readily he admitted that no great progress can he made without incurring expenditure on some of these recommendations, hut it can scarcely he accepted that all of them are essential. For instance is an Arah Mufettish really necessary ? Is it incumbent on Bahrain to provide a special teacher to enable Jev’s to learn their national tongue ? It would, I suggest, he impossible to justify the appointment of a soecial European children* s doctor. And finally the idea of providing universal tuition in English is one which needs approach with the very greatest caution. I© it either necessary or desirable to begin teaching children English when they are only nine years old ? Could not their English tuition he concentrated in certain schools ? And most important of all, ought you not to introduce some school fee at the stage where you begin to teach the children English ? One knows how unpopular a fee would he hut it is evident enough that it has to he imposed at some stage, and this a ems to be the best point. 4. There is one section of Vallance*s report which y excites not a litLie apprehension, and that is the portion \ foisting to ’’Training in Patriotism”. On this subject I must quote from a letter which I have received from Colonel Prior 'I am very sceptical of the possibilities of inculca patriotism and ’Reverence for the flag’ by lessons in school but having never received such instruction perhaps I do not appreciate their finer points. Vallance 1 s acquaintance with Iraq is too short to remember how in the nineteen twenties all the Britishers on the Iraq pay roll were far more Iraqi than the Iraqis themselves and full of zeal in teaching them that they were * on an absolute equality* with other nations. The only harvest of this seed was a fine crop of xenophobia, and the sack for most of the sowars as soon as the Iraqis came into power } v V. »* I l u3“ O No one would deny that the history and geography of Bahrain are highly desirable subjects for instruction In the schools. No one would for a moment object to any attempt to instil feelings of personal loyalty in the children towards their Ruler$ but to suggest that Bahrain should be taught that it is ’’on an absolute equality with other nations*’ and that the Bahrainis are ’’sovereign people able to hold their own as regards antiquity and race integrity with any nation in the world” can only lead to misunder standing and unhappiness for everyone in the future. I do not believe that patriotism can be taught; nationalism can be, and you have only to look around the Near and Middle East to see its dismal results. Indeed I feel that the whole of this section on patriotism might well be re-written before the report is translated into Arabic, or even better - omitted. 5. There is one final point where I must advise caution and that is in regard to the suggested class for the police (page 64 of the report). Irrespective of all considerations it would, I suggest, be unwise to ignore \ \ the fact that quite a number of the men have their eyes on future employment in the Oil Company or as motor drivers, and universal tuition in English will only serve focus their gaze on the rosy goal l Yours sincerely, Ia*.The Adviser to the Bahrain Government presents his compliments to : His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent, Bahrain. 4. copies and has the honour to send him of th&lt; undermentioned documents.

You will remember that a man named Hutchings from Baghdad came to Bahrain last winter in order to inspect the Technical School and advise on the development of Technical Education here. 2. I now enclose a copy of a report which he has just produced* It is an interesting report and I dare say it will be very useful in due course; but you will see that his ideas are rather too large for Bahrain, and I do not think that Bahrain can possibly absorb as many as 50 trained technical students a year. If this report were followed literally, the State would be involved in non-recurring expenditure of close on Rs. 1^ lakhs and recurring expendi ture not very far short of Rs. 50,000 annually. These figures are far beyond what can and ought to be spent here. 3. Frankly I am not quite sure yet how the State can best use this report. But as a preliminary I propose to present a copy of it to Thornburg and to invite his Company to make a gift of the equipment listed. The success of this move of course depends largely on the ability of His Majesty’s Government to make up their minds about the con cession and the pol &gt;tted Area* The Honourable Lieutenant Colonel C n. t)-m 4 n x v* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire•Confidential S No.C/418 - 4/16.

Subject s- Bahrain Education . Sir d I have the honour to forwai^d herewith a report dated the 9th May 1940 submitted by Mr. Vallance, the Director of Education in Bahrain, on the progress made so far towards the reform of the educational system of this State. 2. when handing this report to me the Adviser to the Bahrain Government remarked that he feared I might think th^t the reforms instituted so far were somewhat meagre. In actual fact I am far from holding this opinion. When Mr. Val lane e arrived to take up his duties In Bahrain I was particularly insistent that he should take time to assimilate the atmosphere of Bahrain, to obtain a clearer view of the needs and possibilities of the place, and to begin by attempting to lead public opinion gently towards a more reasonable perspective of the uses of education and the means by which its maximum benefits could be assured. Bearing these considerations in mind my View is that a most excellent beginning has been made. 3. The early part of Mr. Vallance’s report deals with what may be described as the overhaul of the machinery of the department./-department* With the possible exception of the regulations ebout the use of Arab dress, to which X attach no vast signifi cance, the reforms instituted were all urgently required and were a necessary preliminary to any advance* On page 3 Mb* Vallance refers to the propaganda work that has been done in the press, md I might mention here my general impression, based on an all-round improvement In the public attitude towards the department, that the public in Bahrain is well satisfied with the efforts that are being made* On page 4 and in the post script ? T r* Vallance mentions the question of health measures taken or to be taken in the schools. While I fear that Or* Snow, who has only just arrived in Bahrain, may find some difficulty in carrying out his self-imposed programme of visits to the schools, nevertheless I look forward to a vast improve ment in the care of the health of the school children since Dr* snow has already impressed everyone in Bahrain by his energy and obvious determination. The arrangement made with the American ’'ission Hospital for the training of boys from the Government Schools in hospital work is admirable; 'while the results of the experiment at Hedd, Budeyah and afa^ are of profound interest and provide valuable data for the extension of activities elsewhere. So far as the two other existing village schools, Sitra and Suq al Khamis, are concerned (cf. page 9 of the report) my own view is that no further time should be wasted in searching for trained Shia* teachers and that Sunnis should be appointed immediately* Shia* susceptibi lities in these groups of villages will be sufficiently met by the retention of Shia* religious teachers in their schools. I have expressed these views both to the Adviser and to the Director of Education and they are in agreement with me. 4* I come now to the inter-related problems of improving the two large schools in 1 anama and Muharraq, the creation of a single Final Stage School and the opening of a teachers' Training /-- 3 - Training School. Sducatlon In Bahrain is now divided into three stages, the Infant Stage, the Intermediate Stage and the Final Stage, each with three classes. It was originally intended to have Final Sta^e classes in the Manama, Muharraq and Hedd schools, but it is already evident that, for the time being, there will be insufficient pupils fo warrant the enter tainment of staff for Final Stage classes in three different centres. Indeed it seems likely that in the next year or two there will be no more than 40 to 60 boys in the whole of the Government Schools In Bahrain fit for ^insl Stage tuition. This is mainly due to the inadequacies of the teaching staff employed so far in the various schools, and it has long been recognised that little improvement can be made until a proper Training School for teachers is opened here in Bahrain. Un fortunately it has been found that there is no one among the present senior teaching staff capable of training junior school-masters, and indeed there Is no one really capable of teaching in a Final Stage school. Thus the immediate essential is to introduce from outside three or four thoroughly well qualified teachers who can not only take the Final Stage school in Manama but can in addition run the teachers Training School in the evenings. Mr. Vallance informs me that he hopes to get in touch with three or possibly four men whom he knows personally, who have the requisite qualifications and who are sound politically. They will be expensive, for they will require salaries of Rs 300/- per mensem or possibly more, but I am in full agreement with him that until teachers of this type have been recruited no real efficiency can be introduced into the Final Stage tuition. This position is accepted by the Bahrain Government who are prepared to find the funds requ ir ed and who, as the result of th9 concentration of l^inal Stage tuition in Manama, are at least relieved for the time being of providing for this stage at three different centres. There /-There will, it is true, be some small incident»al expense; a few of the poorer boys of Hedd and even of Jluharraq reaching thi l ^i&gt;rge must be enabled to travel free to and from Manama, but the total expenditure will only amount to a few rupees a month* 5. It will be seen that there must be some further delay Defore real improvement can be expected In the l anama and Muharraq Intermediate Schools, but I think this need cause no misgiving ^-or the plan now adopted h*s been worked out on intelligent lines and offers promise for the future* Before leaving this section of my report I should note that t.he Bahrain Government have accepted the principle that fees should oe charged for education in Final Stage* The exact amount of fee to oe charged and the exact arrangements to b e made zo enable the children of poor parents to obtain a com plete course of education remain to b e settled. It may also be noted that tuition in the Final Stage will b e mainly in English* his think is desirable though it certainly involves some preliminary teaching of English in the Intermediate Stage. Provided however that this is restricted to the teaching of Horan characoers in the second class of the Intermediate Stage with elementary reading and writing in the third class, it need iiOt interfere with the accepted principle that Arabic should be the teaching medium for the Intermediate Stage* 6. Finally there remains the question &amp;f the Technical School* I have already forwarded a c6py of Mr* Hutchings* J eport and have pointed out that it sets forth a scheme which is far beyond the needs and capacity of Bahrain. The question oi reducing that scheme to more manageable proportions has been examined and I have had some discussion with the Adviser and the Jirector of Education. It is accepted that technical education is probably the chief essential in Bahrain, and therecan be little doubt that if it is to b e adequate and effective it will involve heavy charges against the State 1 s Budget f costing probably between Rs 30,000 and 40,000 annually apart from non-recurring expenditure on buildings and equipnent• It is intended that Mr* Vallance should discuss this matter again with kr* Hutchings with a view to framing a scheme which, while capable of producing the results required, will keep expenditure at the lowest possible limit* This particular matter will be the subject of a further report in due course* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, f /Va^ Political Agent, Bahrain*Government of Bahrain PROGBESS IN EDUCATION December 1939 May 1940The Education Office, BAHRAIN. f?) r, 9 May 1940 To : C. Balrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E. Adviser to the Bahrain Government , r Sir, I have the honour to submit, as requested, a short report on progress in Education since I became responsible for the Department at the end of November last year. The page-numbers in brackets are refer ences to my Report on Government Education in Bahrain, dated September 1st, 1939. The first step taken was to rationalise the working hours of both masters and boys, in all the schools (P.39). The teaching hours of assistant masters were reduced from 36 per week to 28, and those of head masters to 18. Boys of the Intermediate and Final Stages now do 28 periods in the classroom each week, and those in the Infants* Stage do 24- Sanction was then obtained from the Government to regularise the pay and conditions of teachers at the three large schools of Manamah, Muharraq, and Hidd (PP.40 &amp; 41). Grades of teachers were defined ; per manent rates of pay for each grade were fixed ; annual increments ; up to certain maxima, were established ; and participation in the Government provident Fund scheme was made compulsory. The minimum commencing salary of an assistant master at one of these three schools is now 50 rupees per month, and the minimum annual increment, per month, is 5.@&gt; (•An - 2 - r b The above measures have given the greatest satisfaction, and the staffs of all three schools have expressed in writing their gratitude to the Government and their determination to spare no effort towards improv ing the standard of education in Bahrain. The rule making participation in the Provident Fund scheme compulsory was looked upon as a privilege, rather than as a burden : in the past, only those teachers whose monthly pay amounted to 50 rupees or over were eligible for membership. All stocks of books, stationery, and other equipment were then coll ected from the individual schools, and a central storqff, maintained at the Education Office, has been created. Books and stationery are now supplied free to all boys except those of the Pinal Stage (P.53). The rule about Arab dress for all masters and all boys, at all schools except the Technical School (PP.25 &amp; 42) ? was introduced, and it has been very well received by all concerned. The admission of boys below the age of 6 has been forbidden (PP. 6,29). In spite of this, as is shewn later, the numbers in the schools have risen considerably. The use of the Quran as a first reading-book has been forbidden, and proper infants* reading-books have been supplied to all the schools (P.47). Copy-books, for the proper teaching of handwriting, have been intro duced into all the schools (P.48). Ink has been introduced into all the schools, and the use of pencils, except by boys of the Infants* Stage, has been forbidden (P.51). The iiducation Department is manufacturing its own ink, from powder, and this will prove a great saving financially. Daily physical drill has been introduced into five of the seven schools (P.58). Scouting has not been abolished, as it appears to be dying a natu ral death. ?,The vexed question of beating in the schools was thoroughly examined, and the exercise of corporal punishment has now been strictly regularised, on the lines laid down in the September Report, p.52. A series of short articles, supplied by the Education Office, was printed in the local Arabic newspaper early this year (P.67j. The articles were designed (1) To bring home to the public and to the schoolmasters and ^ schoolboys the exact nature of the deficiencies in thefer system of education. (2) To define the appropriate remedies, and to ask for the help and support of all concerned, in putting them into operation. (3) To point out to the schoolboys the great opportunities (chiefly in the service of oil companies) awaiting those of them who would submit themselves to a short course of technical training ; to stress the equal nobility of manual work with any other kind of work ; and to ask Government schoolboys not to be too proud to join the Technical School. The articles were well received by the public, and there was an imm ediate response from the boys, in the form of a number of applications for places in the Technical School. Rive ex-students of the Carpentry Section of the Technical School,who had completed their training, were engaged by the Education Office as travelling carpenters, and are still engaged in going round the schools repairing the desks, doors, windows, etc., which, owing to long neglect, are in a state of very great delapidation (P.ll). The whole of Manamah School, which was very dark inside, has been brightened, by the method of whitewashing all the walls and ceilings of the classrooms, and the same plan is to be carried out at all the other schools.ft«« - 4 - f' 1 - The health measures advocated on P*15 of the September Report are gradually being introduced into all the schools. The absence of local - dispensaries at some of the villages in which schools are situated malces proper attention to the health of the schoolboys very difficult. However, the idea of responsibility for the health of their charges is sinking into the minds of the schoolmasters, who now very frequently send boys by , bus into Manamah, to report at the Education Office, with a view to their being &lt;^ent by us to one of the local hospitals. This is an expensive method, since we have invariably to defray the costs of travelling between the villages and Manamah : it is therefore much to be hoped that before long additional dispensaries will be opened in the villages. The weakness of the present system is that the (Indian) doctors visit the villages only once a week, which is of course quite inadequate ; in every case where I have sent a boy for medical attention to a Manamah doctor or hospital, they have insisted that he returns for treatment either every other day or every third day. This clearly shews that a single weekly visit by a doctor is inadequate. A 10-days’ propaganda in favour of vaccination was carried out in ^ rN - e vill&amp;gss, amongst both parents and children, with the gratifying re sult that although it was frequently stated by us that no boy would be vaccinated if his parents objected, not a single objection was received, in any village, and no boy absented himself on the day when the opera tions were to be performed. Unfortunately, the actual results were very poor, the successful cases in one school being less than 20$, and we are therefore faced with the necessity of re—vaccination. In my opinion, the failures are due to the perfunctory way in which the work is done, and the complete absence of previous in medical instruction of the boys by the operating doctors. The undesirable ascendancy of Syrian masters over Bahraini masters (PP.26&amp; 38) has been effectively dealt with, and it is now well under stood by all concerned that the ultimate object of the Education Depart- t Im - 5 - I'i ment is the appointment of Bahraini headmasters in every school, and of assistant staffs which are 100$ Bahraini. Educational facilities have been offered to the Police (P.64), and the offer was welcomed by them ; but for various reasons connected with yet their war-time duties they have not^been able to find the necessary time to fit the classes into their daily time-table. ^ An evening school for members of the Ruling Family was opened in April, and eighteen Shaikhs entered themselves for the classes, which include Arabic, Arithmetic, and English. About half of the students are studying all three subjects, and most of the others are studying two. The most popular subject is English. The classes are taught by the Director, the Education Office secretary, and the headmaster of Manamah School. Up to the presentj the attendance of the Shaikhs has been good, and they are working well. An arrangement has been entered into with the American Mission Hos pital in Manamah, under which half-a-dozen boys from the Government schools have begun a two-year course of training in hospital work, including A nursing, compounding, and X-ray work. The Hospital has undertaken to pay the boys a monthly wage throughout their training, and the Education Department has made itself responsible for the continuance of their gen eral education, by means of evening classes. It is understood that there are now well-paid openings for boys with some training, in hospitals run by various oil companies in the Gulf, but that it has hitherto been found impossible to find trained applicants. A large building, formerly the premises of the Eastern Bank in Bah rain, has been rented, to be opened as a Final Stage school in October. The building provides three very large classrooms on the ground floor, besides headmaster’s and masters’ rooms, and a small library. Above, there is boarding accomodation for six masters. The sixty double desks- 6 - (S) required for this school have been made by the Carpentry Section of the Technical School, and the masters 1 rooms are now to be furnished in the same way. The school is intended to accomodate, next October, the pick of all the boys at present in the four top classes of Manamah, Muharraq, and Hidd schools, and after it is opened there will be no Final Stage accomodation at all at any of the other schools, which will become Inter mediate and Infants* Stage schools only, until such time as the Infants are removed to separate schools, when they will become Intermediate Schools solely. The new Final Stage school will be staffed by new masters entire ly, obtained from abroad. The neglected state of the village schools (P.ll) is being steadily remedied. Great support has been given to Hidd School, which has been generously supplied with books, stationery, and equipment, and with some of the masters formerly working at Manamah or Muharraq. A football field has been laid out, and the games-master who formerly served Manamah and Muharraq alone now spends one-third of each week at Hidd School. In every way the school is now being treated as the equal of Manamah and Muharraq, and the numbers have risen from about 140 to over 250, most of whom are numbers go down very considerably. This exodus from the school for the pearling has already begun, but an interesting feature of it this year is that not a single boy from the two top classes, which now have competent masters, is leaving. Budayyi* School has been the subject of some interesting and informa tive experiments. At the beginning of the year the school contained no books of any kind, and the staff consisted of two mullas, able to read but not to write. The curriculum consisted solely of readings from the Quran cind lessons in the practice of religion — how to wash before praying, how to pray, and so on. We supplied the school with books, stationery, equip ment, footballs, etc., without any effect at all. The numbers remained at attendants until the beginning of the pearling season, when the7 - - eg) about 18, and the curriculum remained the same, since the mullas were quite incapable of making use of the new books. After some preliminary propaganda in the district served by the school, one of the best teachers from Manamah was sent to Budayyi 1 as headmaster, the mullas being retained for religious teaching alone. The following day eleven new boys arrived at the school in a body, and by the end of the month the number of regular attendants had reached a total of 52. It was then suggested, both to the parents^ that in future only one hour each day should be devoted to Quran to Religion, and that the rest of the time should be given to Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic, and we offered, if this were agreed to, to supply a second good teacher. No single objection was raised, the mullas them selves saying that they were well aware of their own limitations, and that they would welcome the arrival of efficient teachers. Accordingly, a second good teacher was sent out from Manamah, and the numbers again increased from 52 to over 60. They have now reached 74, and it has been necessary to close the school - which consisted of a single long room - and to commence building a considerable extension. The erection of two large additional classrooms is being carried out entirely by local labour, supplied by the three villages served by the school, and the headmaster is himself super in Wing the building operations. The school is expected to re-open in about a week*s time. The experience gained at Budayyi 1 School makes it clear that what is needed in the village schools above everything else is efficient teaching, and that the local people are far more alive to general situations tha* one might be inclined to suppose - as witness their indifference towards mere equipment, and their immediate response to the supply of efficient instruct ors. It also suggests that they are less bigoted in religious matters than is commonly claimed, as shewn by their ready agreement to the reduction of Quran teaching to a single hour a day, when for years it had been the sole subject of instruction in the village schools. At the same time, I should be the first to agree that it is useless to try to spring changes on these people without careful preliminary propaganda, reasoming, and clear explana-tion of what is proposed. - 8 - The story of Budayyi 1 is being repeated at JRufa 1 School, which until about three weeks ago was in the hands of an elderly Mulla and his son, both of whom could write as well as read, but who were otherwise not very far above the average of the other school mull&amp;s as regards education. Three weeks ago, the best teacher at Muharraq School was sent to fiufa* as headmaster, again with the willing agreement of the mullas, who declared /^hat they would welcome the arrival of an efficient instructor, even though he would take precedence over themselves, by becoming headmaster. When the new headmaster arrived the numbers were about 30. More than 20 new boys arrived in the first week, and now, at the end of three weeks of the new regime, the numoers have reached 104. It has now become necessary to supply the school with a second good master, and this is almost sure to lead to a further increase in the numbers. In any case, Rufa* School is now too small for the number of boys who have become regular attendants, and we shall have either to build, or to turn away some of the boys. An interesting feature of Rufa f School is the presence in it of a number of girls. About a couple of months ago, while I was visiting the i^hool, the Mulla apologised to me for the presence of one girl, his own daughter. I told him that there was no need to apologise, as the education of girls was a very good thing. I said no more than this, but in a few days' time there were ten girls in the school, and there are now 25. Their ages range from about 7 to 11. It is incredible that all these girls are attending the boys' school without the approval of their parents, which is a strong commentary upon our too easily accepted view that such a thing as mixed education simply could not happen amongst the Arabs. As it happens, I am now removing the girls from the school to quarters of their own, but this is solely in order to make room for the greatly increased numbers of the boys, and not from any other consideration. It is very much to be hoped that it may be possible to open a regular girls' school at Rufa' next October, under women teachers.I regret to say that it has not yet been possible to do very much for the two remaining village schools, Sitrah and Suq AL-Khamis. The difficul ty here is that the villages in which these schools are situated are very strongly - in the case of Sitrah, exclusively - Shi 1 !, and that it has been impossible to find in Bahrain any Shi’i teacher of sufficient education and akilit-y to go to either of the two schools as headmaster. We have supplied Sitrah and Suq Al—Khamis generously with books and equipment, and we are supporting the schools by frequent visits, etc., but, as I have pointed out, it is not equipment which is needed, but good teaching. The numbers at Suq Al-Khamis remain at about 40, and at Sitrah, the worst school in the Island, about 25. At the latter school practically nothing is being taught beyond Religion and Quran. We are continuing our search for competent Shi»i mast ers for these schools, and if by the end of the school year they cannot be found we shall try the effect of calling a meeting of the head men of the village and suggesting the appointment of Sunni headmasters next year, side by side with the retention of the mullas for the classes in Religion and Quran. Nor has very much been done, so far, for the two large schools of Manamah and Muharraq. The exaggerated importance accorded to these two schools in the past, and the ascendancy which they had gained over all the other schools, suggested the wisdom of giving attention and support to the lesser schools first, especially as very little can be dome for Manamah and kuharraq until new and efficient masters have been engaged, and this cannot be before the beginning of the new school year. This is not to say that the two large schools have been entirely neglected : they are certainly more efficient to-day than they were six months ago. with better teachers they should become highly efficient schools. v&gt; at I am glad to be able to report that the reforms carried out in the various schools have not, so far, necessitated the dismissal of any teacher A great deal of propaganda has been carried oat, in various ways, in- 10 - (« favour of the Technical School, especially amongst the boys of the other schools (P.61). The result has been a steady flow of applications, both for the Carpentry and the Engineering sides. We have, moreover, been able to place 8 trained or partially-trained Technical School boys in posts at the Oil Camp, some of them as learner- welders at a commencing wage of 30 rupees a month, others as Machine Shop apprentices at 60 rupees a month, and one as an Air Conditioning apprent- ice, also at 60 rupees per month. These salaries are higher than those being received by a number of the masters in the Government schools, and this practical demonstration of the financial value of a little technical training has confirmed the claims which we made in the newspaper articles referred to above, and has greatly assisted our propaganda in favour of the Technical School, which now contains 30 students, a record number, so far. Good reports have been received from the Oil Company of the work and the conduct of the boys we have sent them from the Technical School. In December last the Government was asked to reconsider the question of a substantial enlargement of the small existing school, and sanetion was obtained for the engagement of an expert, to examine and report on the question of extension - in the light of local conditions - not only of the school premises, but also of the curriculum itself : he was also to draw up actual plans for building. Mr. G. S. Hutchings, Principal of the Baghdad Technical School, agreed to visit Bahrain for this purpose, and he has sinc&lt; sent us a most excellent Report, which is now under serious consideration. The Technical School has been the means of enabling a start to be made with the idea of Bahrain becoming the educational centre of the Persian Gulf (P.28). Three boys from Kuwait have recently joined the school as students, two of them with bursaries provided by the Kuwait Oil Company, and the third privately. All three boys are taking the full two-year course, for which they are paying fees, at the rate of 30 rupees per month. They tell us that other boys from Kuwait will be applying for places at our Tech- nical School,{ 3 ? - 11 A large number of leaflets, booklets, and other publications, supp lied by the .Agency and by the British Council, have been distributed in the schools. Those printed in Arabic are eagerly read, but those printed in English are practically useless. The reasons for this will be given in the special report on the subject, which you have asked me to write. In conclusion I am glad to be able to say that five months 1 actual experience of Bahrain schoolboys has confirmed the impression recorded on .-page 69 of the September Report, to the effect that Bahrain boys are of an intelligent type, capable of being educated up to a high standard. Their manners, bearing, and general behaviour are good, they are obedient and anxious to learn, and I have no doubt at all that if only we can secure a number of really competent masters to teach them, we shall soon be turning out boys who will compare favourably, as regards their general education, with those of any other Arab State. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient and humble servant, Director of Education. Since writing this Eeport I have had a conversation with the recently- appointed State Medical Officer, on the subject of school health in Bahrain Dr. Snov: expressed his complete agreement with me as to the inadequacy of weekly visits to schools by medical officers, and told me that he intended to visit every village school three times a week, and to treat the boys him- self. This will be a splendid contribution towards solving the educational problem in Bahrain, which is closely connected with the problem of health.(3 Mr. V&amp;llance is now just completing his first six months of service in Bahrain. He is in many ways an odd person and he mixes very little 7.1th other European resi dents here. In his work as Director of Education however I consider he has done extremely well. He has made himself persona grata with Shaikh Abdullah bin T Isa, the so called Education Member of the Bahrain Government, and having felt his way carefully he has won considerable popularity not only with the Shaikhly Family but also with the intelligent public generally in the two main towns of Manama and Muharraq. I have recently forwarded a copy of his Report on the progress made so far in re-organising Education in Bahrain and in doing so have indicated my view that the work that he has done has been well conceived and well carried out. In short he has made an excellent beginning here in overhauling a complex and difficult Department of the Bahrain Government. v Bahrain, The 26th May 1940.

Perhaps you would like to follow up this idea with Galloway, as 1 understand the Kuwait oil Company may be increasing the number of their trainees, and this would save them the bother of starting a technical school of their own. Surely Saudi Arabia will demand very soon, if they have not already done so, that more of their own subjects should be employed in skilled work by the ? California Arabian Standard Oil Company, if this happens, would they not be prepared to send a number of boys to Bahrain for training ? 1 shall be interested to hear how the scheme progresses.

In the first place the men whom Vallance was going to get to run the Final Stage School and the Teachers 1 Training School, who are Lebanese, are very reluctant to come here. They were pre viously employed by the Iraq Education Department and we believe that in common with all Syrian teachers in Iraq they are now being dismissed. If so they a.ay still come . on here. Vailunco is being sent up to Baghdad again to try and get in touch with them end give them a we^k or ten days in which to make up their minds, and if they decline he will then go to Palestine and if necessary to Egypt to try and find teachers of the class required. It is a pity that Bahrain has to look so fer afield but it is of course inevitable at pre sent ana the three months 1 vacation which has now begun is by no means too long a period in which to search for ^nd engage these teachers. b. in regard to the Technical school, tne difficulties are even greater. It is barely worth while undertaking a fundamental re-organisation of the Technical School, expanding it and equipping it and employing additional instructors unless we can get hold of an absolutely first class Principal. Efforts were made to try to get a certain man from Lngland who / The Hon f ble Lieut-Colonel C. G. Prior, C.I.E. , a.i.&amp;«, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.- 2 - who w s stro n &amp;*y recommended by Hutciiings, but unTortunately ne apparently cannot leave England. There are of courae English technical instructors employed in Iraq but none of them hav^ got the very wide qualifications requireu in the Principal of the College here and in an&gt; case it is scarcely the time to try to filch from Inq Englishmen wno have been employed there tnrough the efforts of the Embassy or the British Council. 4. • I am afraid I do not know vlnat standard has been reached in Inaia JLn technical education. Here again I do not imagine a we could getZfirst class Englishmen with wide experience and qualifications, and I am not sure if there are any Anglo-Indians ii who could hold the job. We can of course make enquiries, but I have been wondering whether it woulc not be a good plan in the present circumstances co try out an American. I should never think of this in normal times but as things are at present it does seem to be v.orth while taking this into consideration. Before however I suggest it formally to the Bahrain Government I should be most grateful if you would let me know what you think of this idea. One of the objections is that Americans are usually more expensive than Englishmen, but on the other hand we 3h&lt;TU4£ have xa iron the Oil Company in selecting a really good man at as reasonable a wage as possible. , i 5. Meanwhile I have given Thornburg a copy of Hutching 1 s Report, Vallance has haa further talks with Hutchings, and he, Belgrave and I are going to see what we can get out of the Oil Company now.

I do not like the idea of employing an American for the Technical School, and it would he better to allow the proposals to await the end of the war rather than to engage one. The atmosphere of Bahrain has already become far too Americanised, and if we start introducing them into the Bahrain Administra tion there will be nothing left but to invite them to assume a Mandate over Bahrain. 3. I see no reason, however, why we should not make enquiries from India where plenty of technical people are available, nor why a good Anglo-Indian should not be forth coming . There are Technical Schools in jubbulpore and places like that with a high standard of training, and the pay that Bahrain could offer should be sufficient to secure a thoroughly competent man.

I think it is usual for most governments to fix certain rates by certain classes of transport and to pay these rates to its servants leaving them to find their way to their destinations at their discretion and possibly if they were paid accoruing to paragraph 8(c) of their contracts together with a reasonable daily halting allowance as C* Dalrymple Relgrave, Esq*, C.B.E*, Adviser to the Bahrain uovernment, Bahrain*- a paid to the various grades of uovernment officials in Iraq, if this is ascertainable, or if not according to Indian rates plus an allowance for the extra cost of living in Iraq, it might save lot of bother.

I return the letter from the Palestinian teachers, eventually I received a copy of it myself. The question of their travelling allownaces has now been settled, they are being paid Es 250/- each, excluding Basra-Bahrain, which after consideration appears to me a reasonable amount. They were asked to produce receipts for their expenses, with one exception none of them produced any. They were then asked to submit statements of expenditure, these varied from £ 50 to £ 21 and included many payments which would in no case be admitted. We have no regular daily rates because normally Thos Cook act as our Agents and arrange all details of journeys of persons coming here on duty. The teachers were given advances on arrival in Bahrain besides the money advanced in Palestine. Bach man has now given a detailed pay sheet and all pay and allowances due to him.

As The Resident was sympathetic, I have written home for the primary text-book to be sent to him.

Reference our telephone con versation this morning I forward you herewith de Grenier* s note in original / l and the article to which he refers for favour of your views and return. Yours sincerely, C.R.L. Adrian-Vallance, liaq,, Director of llducation, Bahrain, 4 ' V \ Vv\( GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. Dear Alban, I which it was attached. ' 'Basic English' is not of much use to schoolboys if one wants them to learn our language properly. It contains only 18 verbs, a number of which are not full verbs, and its total vocabulary is limited to 850 words. On the other hand, we expect our boys, after three years 1 worlc in English, to know at least 2000 words, and how to^iise them correctly. 'Basic English' is quite useful for those who are mere beginn ers, and if de Grenier had made an enquiry.at this office before suggesting the adoption of 'Basic English' in Bahrain, he would have found that the system was already in use here. The usefulness of 'Basic English' for beginners lies in the fact that its inventor has made a very skilful selection of 850 extremely useful words, which may well be employed as a nucleus upon which further study can be built up later. I do not know whether de Grenier knows that 'Basic English' is a money-making concern, like the much-advertised 'Pelmanism'. I knew the inventor of 'Basic English' very well at Cambridge, about return de Greniers letter and the booklet totwenty years ago, at the time when he was working out his system, and I well remember that his sole idea then was the production of a kind of simplified English, to be used all over the world by busi ness houses and commercial concerns, with the object of facilitating international trade. The idea of trying to introduce the system into schools was no uoubt a later development, suggested by its ob vious financial possibilities. De Grenier, quoting from one of the firm’s advertisements, says that 'Basic English' is 'the best and simplest method by which non- English school children can obtain the root principles of our langu age with the minimum of toil”. In my opinion, the last few words of this sentence condemn the whole system as an instrument of ii , ruc tion in schools. Schools are not looking for systems which provide 'the minimum of toil”, and here in Bahrain we are trying to get into the boys’ heads the idea that nothing really worth having can be ob tained without the maximum of toil i With kind regards, Yrs. v. sincerely, Major R.G.E.W.

Dear Alban, Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Alkhalifah yesterday decided that the Palestinian master Yusuf Hammuri, who is an assistant master in the Muharraq school, should be given three months notice, according to the terms of his agreement, and required to leave Bahrain on the first possible occasion. Yusuf Hammuri has been behaving badly for some time and finally he refused to take orders from the headmaster and tore up some written instructions which the headmaster had given him and threw them up his face, in front of the staff. Shaikh Abdullah is afraid that this man will cause trouble among the boys and some of the masters so he does not propose to give him notice until there ^ is some news about the date of the up boat sailing. At present the agents have no information. ^ suggested that you should be informed about this matter as doubtless Yusuf Hammuri will make a complaint to you. Yours sincerely, Major R.G.E.W.

The three Syrian teachers referred to reported here on October 3rd that they had been refused permission to enter Koweit and go on to Bahrein by launch. They did not ask us to try and arrange this for them and we therefore suggested they should take the next mail steamer, v/hich was due to leave on October 7th. Apparently the primary reason why they were not permitted to go via Koweit was that they had not obtained visas before starting. They did not indicate that they were in any special hurry and as they had accepted the fact they could not go through Koweit we did not bother to find out precisely why or endeavour to send them that way but assisted them to go by the normal sea route. prolonged their journey unnecessarily, but they seem to have shown a certain lack of initiative in not obtaining visas for Koweit and not explaining to us the reasons why they wished to go overland. Now, finding they may lose pay by having failed to arrive earlier, they-,rather naturally,exaggerate the facts a bit and try to place the responsibility on us. feel that their only fault was unfamiliarity with travel regulations in these parts and a certain lack of initiative and drive.

D.O. No January 4, 1942 Dear Alban, I find that it will be necessary for Hutchings to go himself to Bombay in order to obtain the material for the Technical School. He will proceed there by air as soon as a passage is available and I am authorising him to purchase goods up to the sum of Rs. 25,000/-. He has received quotations from Bombay for much of the material but as some of it is second hand and in some cases no quotation is given the suppliers urge that he should see the goods before purchasing. I should be very grateful if you would inform the proper authorities in Delhi that Hutchings is being sent to Bombay to deal with the matter. His address will be care of The Eastern Bank Limited, Bombay. It is not possible for him to supply the list of material, which will be required before an export permit can be issued, until he has seen and selected the goods. Would it be possible for you to give him a letter stating that he is on official business which he could show to the authorities in Bombay? I think this would be of assistance. When he has made the selection and applies for an export permit it will be necessary for him to quote some official corres pondence on the subject. We are very anxious to get the material. The opportunity of obtaining it will probably become less as the war goes on. If we can buy the machinery, tools etc., which Hutchings recommended and which are now available in Bombay the School will be able to carry on for the duration of the war. Major R.G.E.W.

I have read Hutching*s report with much interest but little pleasure for he takes a very gloomy view of the future and makes no constructive suggestions. * I notice one or two mis-statements in the report in particular with regard to my suggestion that automobile engineering might use fully form one of the subjects taught. Hutchings indicates that the advice I gave him was, for practical purposes, without value but omits to state that he informed me that he had obtained the promise of a vehicle from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. I even offered to do my utmost to find a trained automobile mechanic and made suggestions from where I thought one might be forthcoming. On the question of material while his statements are accurate they do th© whole story for in October of last year and again in November of last year I advised Hutchings to ask us to help him to obtain materials from India. At the time his report was written he had not made any application to me for assistance. In other words there was a complete waste of three months. 3. I know nothing of Hutchings' capabilities as an instructor but I h^ve tho impression that he would be of more practical value to the State if he would withdraw his head from the clouds and concen trate on doing the best he can with the materials available. If it is desirable to live, which is sometimes a debatable point, and the Savoy ; beyond ones means some less magnificent habitation must be found until the financial situation improves. 4. If it is desirable to live — that is the question — and the answer as regards the technical school I consider should be most C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., /emphatically Adviser to the Government of Bahrain2 * L emphatically in the affirmative. I am hopeful of being able to obtain materials from India and my advice would be to increase the pay of the present staff to induce them to remain for another year. They are technicians and any increase in their pay need not necessarily mean a similar increase in the pay of other branches of the Kducational Department. It may now be possible to obtain teachers from Palestine or Egypt and I would suggest that endeavours be made through Wakelin who has contacts in Egypt and Palestine to obtain useful indi viduals. Wakelin is the British Council*s representative in those parts and I am sure that he will only be too willing to help. 5. In order that you may know exactly what prospective employers require I strongly advise that the Bahrain Petroleum Company, who I hope will be one of your principal markets, should be asked to discuss the matter with a vfcw to settling any differences of opinion there may be and to coordinate training on the most satisfactory lines. One of the first things to do is to get rid of the feeling in the Oil Company that Hutchings is more of an artist than an engineer and his pupils in consequence of little use as fitters, and the feeling in Hutchings* mind that the Oil Company is a self-centred Juggernaut with no ideas above the making of money. 6. I have had several talks with Hamilton the Chairman of the Bahrain Petroleum Company ; and have been impressed by the interest which he took when he recently visited Persia in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company*s training scheme for Persians. These schemes were originated by Jameson who is now one of the Direc tors of the Company and they have proved a great success and of the utmost value to the Company and I think Hamilton would like to see something on the same lines done in Bahrain. It is not possible to achieve the ideal in times of war but it will at least be peasonable to expect the Company to assist even if that assistance is limited to the provision of scrap metal. {Cci) . ~r. tar&gt;jtec AH ^COPY H#Q* Station Commander, Bahrain, No .SCAttsc .43/938 .

The Officers who pass through this centre will constitute a Pool from which Military, Diplomatic and administrative demands for personnel may be met. 2. It is anticipated that the Centre will remain in existence for at least the duration of the War and, should it be found to justify xdxamtxgKgMXxtgxgRHtixtKHxitx&amp;ltKxxthHxtRxaxxxtiHXxxxx its existence, it seems quite conceibable that it might be advantageous to continue it after the termination of hostilities, though this must, of course, depend on future commitments in this part of the world and the general development of the situavtion. 2. Since it is unlikely that post war conditions will permit of the placing of more than a limited number of British Officers and officals in the Arab States of the Middle ^ast, it is of great importance that those who can be so employed shall be the best available . Officers selected to undergo training at the Centre should therefore, be of a high standard, that aimed at being the standard required of, say candidates for admission to the Sudan Administration, though the educational requirements might be relaxed A knowledge of Arabic is not necessary. of 20 Officer students. These students may be from any of the three fighting services and will join the course under the rules governing the seconding of officers to any other course of instruct ion. In addition it may be possible to accept students from civil administrations, the British Council or business firms provided that no expense on their account fall on Service Funds. at the Centre for a period of six months . At the end of that time they will be attached to diplomatic political or administrative organisations in the Middle' ^ast for two or three months, returning thereafter to t he Centre to continue their studies and perhaps specialise in the problems of some one country. It is hoped in this way to produce at the end of the year*s course some fifteen to twenty officers with a working knowledge both of Arabic and the general conditions of the Arabic speaking countries in the Middle East. is impossible to foresee what posts there may be. Successfully to have completed the course cannot, however, but be an asset to any student who may wish in the future to present himself as a candidate for the Foreign, Colonial or Sudan Services, though here again, no promise of employment can be given. It will also, obviously, be an asset to any regular officer of the services. sufficient candidates are forthcoming it is hoped to open the first course about 1st May. Number of Students 3.
