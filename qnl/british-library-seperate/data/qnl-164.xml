The letters concern developments on both sides of the Gulf. The most prominent correspondents are the following: Goolab [Gulab Anandadas], Native Agent at Muscat; Mirza Ally Akbar [Mirza Ali Akbar], Native Agent at Shiraz; and Moollah Houssein [Mullah Husain], Native Agent at Sharjah. In addition, there are letters from native representatives at Bahrein [Bahrain], Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh] and Isfahan. Aside from the aforementioned correspondence, this file contains a small number of translations of letters addressed to the Resident (and in the case of two letters, to Captain William Sowden Collinson and William Bentick, Governor General of India, respectively) from local rulers, including the following: His Highness the Imam of Muscat [Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Bū Sa‘īd, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]; Sooltan bin Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī, ruler of Ra's al-Khaymah and Sharjah]; Shaik Abdool Russool Khan [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān, Governor of Bushire]; Shaik Tahnoon [Tahnun bin Shakhbut Āl Nahyān, Shaikh of Abu Dhabi]; Shaik Abdoollah bin Ahmed [Shaikh Abdullah ibn Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah, Shaikh of Bahrain]; His Royal Highness the Shah of Persia [Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh Qajar]; and His Royal Highness the Prince of Shiraz [Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mīrzā]. These letters appear either as attachments to the native agents' letters, or as singular items.Recurring themes found throughout the letters from the various native agents include relations between local rulers (both friendly and hostile) and the numerous visits undertaken by those rulers. The letters also discuss topics which are specific to the agent's region or location: agents writing from the ports of the Gulf report on the arrival and departure of ships (including French brigs); the Acting Agent at Bahrein provides updates on the pearl diving season; Mirza Ally Akbar [Mirza Ali Akbar], writing from Shiraz, relays information on the effects of the cholera outbreak in Tabreez [Tabrīz] and discusses relations between the Prince of Shiraz and the Russians.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Shiraz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Prince-Governor of Fārs, Qajar dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrein</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sheraz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Cholera</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00001a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
