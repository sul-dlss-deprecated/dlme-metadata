The Government of India have decided not to lay down any general rules on the following points until some experience has been gained of the operation of the rules now publisheds- 1. the insurance of cars; 2. the valuation of cars on change of incumbents; 3. the submission of periodical reports of the mileage run by a car, as compared with the mileage for which travelling allowance is claimed, as a check on any excessive use for private purposes; 4. the regulation of the grant of conveyance allowance to officers to whom cars are supplied at the public expense, mainly for use at headquarters.Rale* for 1^6 purchase and maintenance of i&amp;otor car* at th# public ex erse for the uae of Govern: ont officers other than heads of province** I* The supply of a motor car at the public expense to a Govern ent officer requires the previous sanction of the Secretary of &amp;tate. duch supply will be allowed only in exceptional cases ana on very strong grounds* It is not sufficient to show merely that the perfor^iancc of an officer 1 * duties will be facilitated oy th grant of a carj anu f in submitting a reco men- datlon to the Government of India f a Local Governnent or administration should clearly Justify ! h* necessity for ihe supply 11 * The following are the condition* governlr^g the use of a motor car wnicu has been supplied to a Government ol fleer at the public expensei- i* Ho person shall be permitt«Hl to drive tae car who does not possess the certificate of qualification prescribed by the Local Government for the purposes of these rules* 11* A Local Governrnent may permit he officer to make a reasonable use f the ce*r for private purposes.

From our reply you will see that the position at the moment is not any too cheerful. It is very difficult to obtain adequate quantities of sheet steel, and supplies of components do not get any more plentiful. This means that, so far as our BRADFORD” commercial vehicle is concerned, we are working on about five-eighths to three-quarters of our real capacity.

We very much appreciate your interest in our products but at the noment we are faced with two problems; one is the fact that we have appointed an agent for Arabia, which appointment we have taken to include the Island of Bahrain, and, secondly, the production position is so bad in this country at the moment that we cannot at present contemolate expanding our export operations. We feel the best thing to do for the time being is to leave the application in abeyance until re can see a little more clearly how many vehicles we shall be able to ship overseas and whether or not we intend to separate Bahrain from the Arabian territory.

Extras: Painting in green, blue or grey: passenger’s seat. THE BRADFORD 10 CWT. VAN THE BRADFORD VAN Designed for a 10 cwt. payload with a capacity of 93 cubic feet, yet to give all the economy of an 8 h.p. engine. With low unladen weight, yet extremely strong with bonded metal body. For light bulky loads 8 cwt. springs may be specified when ordering. Extras: Painting in green, blue or grey; passenger’s seat. W hen the JOWETT factory at Idle, Bradford, Yorkshire, had finished its War work, immediate steps were taken to put into production again a range of light commercial vehicles. The se are now known as the BRADFORD range which consists of the 10 cwt. Van, the drop-side Lorry and the six-seater Utility. The BRADFORD chassis follows the general lines of the well-known pre-war models (many of wh ich have done 250,000 miles and more), but it has been considerably strengthened and the water-cooled horizontally opposed twin-cylinder engine has been redesigned to give a greater power output. Now rated at 8 h.p., this 1,005 c.c. unit develops 19 b.h.p. at 3,500 r.p.m., and is notable for its solid construc tion and simplicity, its hard working qualities and high power output at low engine speeds Owing to the big bearing surfaces and the fewer moving parts which this flat twin design permits, longer life, greater economy and consistent reliability are ensured. The IOWETT factory has been producing horizontally opposed water-cooled twins since 1906 and, as the testing ground is the wild country ^ the Yorkshire me 's, a very hardy vehicle has been de veloped, suitable for use in any part of the world. The Bradford has already won a permanent overseas rv-\ Is f- nnA ic K\/ 3 \AZO T I H-\A/1H P SD3.r6S SCrVlCC.

BRADFORDS FOR EXPORT All BRADFORDS are available with left-hand steering and metric instruments for export. Overseas BRADFORDS are fitted with Export air cleaners. THE BRADFORD SI To meet the needs of those requiring extra passenger accommodation as a station wagon, shooting brake or personnel car—the Six-Seater Utility has been introduced. The body of the Utility—which has four windows in each side—is of the same spacious dimensions as the Van (93 cubic feet) X-SEATER UTILITY and has the four extra passenger seats staggered at each side of the wide centre aisle for maximum leg room. They are quickly detachable for carry ing bulky loads. The wide opening rear doors give easy access to these seats. The 8 cwt. springs are fitted. Price includes painting in grey, blue or green.

The Jowett Javelin has successfully come through the most rigorous tests and is now going into production. It is hoped to have it ready early in 1947 in quantities that will make it available to critical motorists the world over and at a price no less interesting than the car itself. Javelin’s lines are smooth and clean. Wind resistance has been minimised. There’s no place where dust and mud can cling. Javelin seats five adults comfortably—six on occasion.

It provides really comfortable travelling for four adults with generous platform space behind the rear seat for luggage or sporting equipment, and when occasion demands the rear seat can be quickly folded down to provide an exceptionally large rear platform for goods carrying. The body, of ash framed construction, is smart and serviceable in appearance and the four forward hinged doors permit quick access to the large, deep and adjustable front seats and deeply cushioned rear seat. Toughened glass is used throughout and both driving and passenger visibility is remarkably good. On the road the Sixteen Shooting Brake proves that it is fully capable of giving a highly satis fying performance at all times. The overhead valve engine, which has a high power output, makes short work of the steepest hill and provides that rapid acceleration which proves so useful in traffic, or when overtaking a slow moving vehicle on the open road. Variable ratio Cam gear steering simplifies difficult manouevring on full lock and powerful Girling brakes provide that confidence of control essential for safe driving. For convenience and for dependable all round service the Sixteen Shooting Brake will make an immediate appeal to the countryman and to all motorists who appreciate the worth of so practical and exceedingly useful a vehicle. . Jv THE AUSTIN SHOOTING BRAKE IS THE IDEAL VEHICLE FOR FARM AND ESTATEI -v x ESTATE TRANSPORT The deep comfortable rear seat har^'iholstered side arm rests. When it is desired to increase the . -ar loading space, the seat cushion hinges forward to the vertical position and the seat squab hinges downwards to lie flush with and thereby extend the rear platform area The generous oading space available when the rear seat is folded forward is clearly shown in this picture. Steel strips on the floor provide a hard wearing surface, and the hingec tailboard permits easy loading and un loading of stores and equipment. mm The shooting brake has a particularly reat and appearance when viewed from any an;jle.

This is based on the fact that the area is very extensive and the going is extremely bad in most parts, causing considerable wear and tear to vehicles. For safe touring it is considered essential that there always be two vehicles in case one breaks down. The Ford V.8'Pick-up has been proved as the most suitable vehicle for the Trucial Coast. It may oe mentioned that P.O.T.C. and R.A. always go on tour together for periods of note | a week, when two vehicles are really necessary. The present situation is that the Govt. 15 C.W.T. truck has been replaced by a new Pick-up. One more pick-up is therefore required. 4. Ref oara 2. for your orders. \ 4 r- P.

Near the beginning of the file the Political Agent states a preference for Humber models as the Agency's official cars (specifically a Super Snipe Saloon and a Super Snipe Station Wagon), since the Government of Bahrain already possesses several of these vehicles, and therefore servicing facilities would be available. The file largely consists of the Political Agent's correspondence with a number of car distributors and agents, both in Bahrain and in Britain, regarding the purchase and shipment of the Humber and Austin vehicles. Also discussed is the Political Agent's request for two pick-up trucks for the Political Agency on the Trucial Coast (no purchases of such vehicles are documented in this file).Correspondents include the following: the Political Agent, Bahrain; the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Rootes Limited (car manufacturers and distributors, London); A A Zayani and Sons (general merchants and commission agents, Bahrain); the Commonwealth Relations Office, Whitehall, London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>A A Zayani and Sons</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Rootes Motors Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Trucial Coast Political Agency</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Cars</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
