Purvey of Neutral Zone. Sir, I have the honour to report that Major Pap worth, H.E., has completed the survey of the Neutral Zone to-day (17.11.33.) and is returning to Basra via Kuwait at once. 2. The second survey party working on the north side of the Bay of Kuwait should finish in the course of another « week. 3. i^or your information, I visited Major Papworth’s camp, 10 miles South of Jebel Banaiya on the coast in the Hazaim region of the Neutral Zone, on 10-th November, and proceeded thence to Wafra, where I found a patrol of Ibn Jalouis under Ibn Shajaan camped on the wells. Ibn Bhajaan told me he had been deputed to look after the Survey Party. I told Ibn Shajaan that Major Pap worth had a sufficient escort frcm the Shaikh of Kuwait, and did not really require his party. Tbn Shajaan said he would report to Major Papworth the next day and then take his leave. This he did and, I believe, proceeded south ax^ain on 16th November. 4. I am afraid trie real reason for Ibn bhajaan’s presence at Wafra was that he was hunting some Awazim contra band runners, and made the survey party an excuse for his( 5 ) - 2 - / his activities* He, no doubt, hoped to get from L'ajor Papworth a share of the largesse, which the latter has been distributing. 5. From SVafra, X returned to Kuwait on 12th November having spent two ni$its in the desert, and done 205 miles over shockingly bad country. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd.

Captain Papworth, R.K# f sntera^ the Kuwait Neutral Zone on 4th February via Man&amp;qish and Khabrat Buwish, having previously obtained permission from Air Headquarters to do so. He pitched his base oamp at ihalaiat aa-Sur, a point eome 7 miles South eat of Jebel ‘'owaria, and on the western edge of the Neutral Zone. From this , oint he daily motored to the various important features in the Neutral Zone, whose position he wanted to fix. The writer was not told that Captain lapworth had actually entered the Neutral Zone, and hearing from Bedouin sources that he was at Thainlat as-Sur, proceeded there on 8th February, both to see whether all was well with him, and to enquire if he had received formal permission to start work in the Zone. The journey to the survey officer’s camp was mads via ^raifjan, Grain, Jebel v owarie, and the return journey by another route 10 miles to the South of Khor e1-Grain. Everywhere were found pools and lakes of water showing that extra heavy rain had fallen there. At Jebel Fowarls the writer searched for and located the Sulphuric Acid Gas ’’Escapes', which are reported to exist there, and which are believed to Indicate possible 'oil' deposits. Era.

Q£) Extract from Enclosure in Colonial Office Covering Letter No.18120/33, dated 13th March, 1933. V. Kuwait Survey Party, . (a) It is satisfactory to learn that His Majesty's Minister at Jedda was able to convince the King that there was no truth in the ridiculous report, which had reached Lecca, that the Boyal Air Force Survey Party, under Caotain Papworth, R.E., was interfering with the Kuwait-Nejd boundary line. What was actually meant is somewhat difficult to follow at this end. Sufficient is to say that no boundary marks of any sort exist anywhere along the whole frontier, and certainly no ordinary Bedouin knows exactly where the frontier line runs. The latter was only marked on official British maps after the Ojair Conference of 1923, and even the Shaikh of Kuwait ninself had the most 'hazy' idea, as to exactly where the frontier was, until the writer took him in hand 2 years ago and motored him along tne approximate line, which the frontier made by us, followed. (b) Reoorts received at the end of January show that the King has agreed to allow the Survey Party to work in the Kuwait Neutral Zone, and has waived his original request that a Saudi representative should work with the party. This is eminently satisfactory, as Captain Papwortn the Survey Officer has for sometime been most anxious to get on with his work, which has been held up. The Saudi Foreign inister's later suggestion that time was required to ensure that proper measures were taken for the party's safety in the Neutral Zone need not, as mentioned by His Majesty's minister, be taken seriously. The Bedouins now in the Neutral Zone and south of it consist of very harmless Kuwaiti, and Awazim tribesmen, who always are most ready to welcome any English men among them. The neighbouring tribes also of North Hassa are/A © are old Kuwait subjects and most friendly to any one coming south into their country. ference of frontier marks, of course emanated from one of the many miserable agents that Bin Saud maintains in Tr uwait, and is a good example of the mischief that these worthies are for ever attempting to create. They naturaliy want to gain the King's notice else no pay comes their way; hence they have recourse to fabrication on the least excuse. These agents are for the most part young men out of work and occupy their time loafing in the market square taxing the names of any miserable Nejd tribesman who may have run the blockade in search of a little rice or piece of clothing. Names are subsequently sent out to A1 Bagaawi, Bin Baud's frontier Officer, and the latter waits for his rnan and duly punishes him when caught. The worst of it is the spy's evidence is always assumed to be above doubt. (c) The report that reached the King of supposed interm/m. vr' , ! 'ndexe ?

Id that* since I bn Baud and the isheikh of Kbweit possess equal rights in the Xbwcit neutral zone# the consent of both aeeais necessary before the survey can take place. We also originally felt that there might be considerable objection to approaching Ibn Baud in the natter of the survey at a tine when we are aaking hi* for aircraft facilities along the Hasa Coast. Hyan. who* we consulted, shared this view to soae extent but thought the objection need not be overwhelming provided that the natter were handled tactfully* He thought it would be preferable not to put it to Xbn Saud as a request for permission *oup Captain H.S.C.Peirse. D.S.Oo. A.F.C e»^ pormisalon but rather to say that the surrey le proposed and that we trust that he will have no objections wore than the Sheikh of Koweit* whose consent would have been previously obtained« 3. Ryan now tells me that he discussed the matter with Burnett and yourself on November 2 when you told him that the Sheikh of Koweit had not yet been consulted* He therefore suggested that action should be taken to secure the Sheikh’s consent, which is a matter of form*? so that the matter mighty if we agreed, be put to Xbn Samd on the lines proposed above* He also considered that. If time were not a serious factor, the chanoea of success with Ibn Saud might be rather greater if he took up the question himself after his return to «Tedda on December 81 as he could perhaps then deal with it more effectively than if it were put through earlier in a routine manner* I unde 2 *stand that Burnett and you both agreed with Ryan’s views, and that you told him that the proposed new map will be a published one, a point which will enable Ryan to use the argument that it will be useful to the Saudi Government as to everyone else. 4.
