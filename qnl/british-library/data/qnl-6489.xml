Note by Sir A. Lyall ob Affairs in Persia. i Sir H. D. Wolff has suggested to the Shah’s Minister that a decree should be published, declaring all Persians secure in their lives, liberties, and properties, &amp;c. Also the appointment of a Commission for development of national resources. His Majesty promptly issued the decree, with a threat of great personal severity to be used against any one disregarding it. It appears to me that advice of this kind should be cautiously tendered to an Oriental Court. I cannot conceive that in any country in the world would there be anything really gained by the issue of such a general and indefinite decree, not followed or supported by guarantees of any kind, or by the introduction of machinery or procedure for enforcing these vague injunctions, There is no competent tribunal to protect person and property in Persia, and there are no regular laws which a tribunal might carry out. The only consequence to be anticipated from such edicts, which every Eastern Govern ment promulgates profusely, would be to multiply confusion and complaints, and to give additional pretexts to those who, like the Russians, are ready to profit by the mismanagement and unpopularity of the Persian Government. I must add, privately, that I cannot think it will strengthen the reputation of our Legation for experience and sagacity, if it is generally known that these edicts are issued under English advice and pressure. We might probably be able gradually to introduce substantial reforms by aiding the Minister wiio should resolve to undertake some serious administrative measures, beginning with finance and the collection of revenue, which is the basis of all improvement in Asiatic States ; but these projects, to succeed, require careful study of the conditions of the problem, and of the actual circumstances of the country. For similar reasons, I cannot believe that a Commission for the development of the national resources of Persia could be of any use unless a very distinct plan of operations, adapted to the needs and capacities of the country, were first laboriously worked out There is evidently great jealousy, on the part of Russia, of English enterprise and capital. We should be as likely to involve the Persian Government in fresh complications, and to give Russia fresh inducements to interfere, as to bring about satisfactory results, by setting on foot an inquiry of this kind before we have settled its scope and direction. There is no doubt that Russia and England, acting together in good faith and without arriere jpensee, could effectively impose internal reforms upon Persia. But the two European Powers differ profoundly inter se as to their notions and systems of good government; their interests, political and com mercial, by no means coincide ; their representatives have always been in opposite camps at Tehran; Russia has always refused to guarantee the integrity of the Persian kingdom, and the Persian Ruler has constantly entreated England to protect him against Russian threats and encroachments. What grounds are there here for believing that Russia and England will ever work heartily together for the regeneration of Persia, for assuring the State’s integrity, and for developing its resources, its commerce, and its industry ? And until we have some solid ground under our feet, a Convention in the terms sketched by Sir H. D. Wolff may only raise controversy and lead to misunderstandings. I admit that if Article I. is accepted by Russia, i.e., if the independence and integrity of Persia are placed under a joint guarantee, this does give some solid ground for the ulterior steps proposed. But Prince Dondoukoff has already thrown out a hint of a partition of Persia, nor am I aware of any reason for supposing that Russia will join in a guarantee of territorial integrity in order to promote internal reforms. And unless this territorial guarantee is first secured, it would, I fear, be very unsafe to encourage and countenance Russian interference by inviting her to join us in the difficult and delicate undertaking of reforming the administration of 17173. I. 1608.2 Persia. Disputes and mutual distrust would arise at every point, and the outcome might be that “ the restless and harassing activity of Russia ” might be found more difficult than ever to control. She might insist on going much further on the course of internal improvement than would suit our political views, and she might obtain great additional advantages of position and influence. The better and safer mode of action would be to begin by fixing upon some particular reform which might be determined to be of the first urgency and importance,—the revision (for instance) of the financial or revenue system,—to work out the outlines and ground plan of the new scheme, and to ascertain unofficially whether the Russian Legation would join in recommending it. But I should venture to suggest very great caution in proposing a Convention that might invest the Russian Government with formal power to superintend the internal reform and development of Persia. This would be to establish a sort of joint protectorate, not unlike the system that we have seen tried in Egypt. A. C. L. 27th June 1888.
