These structures are likely to have been constructed in a manner indigenous to the region and which resemble the semi-ruined structures in the previous image; that is, walls constructed from black basalt coated with mud plaster for the lower storeys and similarly coated mud brick for the upper storeys.InscriptionsRecto:Upper centre:‘Picture of the Sanctuary of Medina the Radiant’To the right and left of the title:‘The sanctuary of the mosque of the messenger of God which the world yearns to see.A garden of Paradise and the mausoleum of the Prophet;If you must see it, here is its image.’To the right and left of the image:‘Within the holy sanctuary, the Mosque of the Prophet is well adorned. On both sides of the holy pulpit flags have been set up. A green curtain hangs on the door of the pulpit. Everyone longs to sit in this garden of Paradise. They walk around with flasks of cold water from [the well of] Zamzam. In front of the blessed mausoleum, on a high stage, sits the shaikh of the sanctuary. Turkish soldiers in black and yellow uniform stand respectfully. At the Bab Jibril there is also a guard. Though people from different countries are present here, yet it is a world of complete silence. In accordance with the custom of the Prophet, on Fridays the preacher enters immediately after the call to prayer accompanied by the muezzin. The muezzin gives the call to prayer by standing on the first stair of the pulpit, four other muezzins repeat it after him. With [recitation of the] words,
                           Allahu akbar, divine glory becomes manifest. When the venerable name of the Prophet occurs in the call to prayer, a tumult of prayers and blessings on the Prophet rises from the entire mosque. When the words, “This is the noble Prophet”, come forth from the mouth of the preacher, hearts in breasts become restless and streams of tears begin to flow from the eyes. It entirely seems as if the Prophet himself were alive. After the prayer, the pilgrims and visitors [to the tomb] stand respectfully, reciting benedictions and blessings on the Prophet. The instructor guides continue reciting blessings, and all follow them in a loud voice. Then all return to their own places of residence with unwilling hearts. Engraved across one side of the lattices of the most sacred mausoleum: “There is no god but the Lord, the Truth, the Manifest; Mohammed, the one faithful to promise, the trustworthy, is the messenger of God.” All the letters are visible individually, with desirous eyes yearning to see them all the time.’Lower centre: 'H.
