ISo^rJ AtrJdlf,-“r937. i o. /', rW Dear Clauson, I enclose herewith the copy of a despatch from Ui Bullard in Jedda in regard to the exemption of Saudi Arabian nationals from a tax to which British nationals will continue to be subjected. We are of course only concerned with the question of discrimination against British subjects. Our treaty relations with the Government of Saudi Arabia are^ as you are aware^based on the Treaty of Jedda 1927 as modified by the Exchange of Notes of the 3rd October, 1936, neither of which accord His Majesty*s Government any right to national treatment in the matter of taxation. We are advised by Beckett that there is no vt principle of international law prohibiting the levy on resident foreigners at higher rates or on different grounds than nationals and this is shown by the fact (l) that most countries/r,.i — countries do discriminate against foreigners in their taxation to a greater or lesser extent; (2) that clauses for national treatment as regards taxation are put into commercial and establishment treaties and often these clauses are only agreed to after much discussion. V/e propose therefore subject to the concurrence of departments concerned, to reply as in the attached draft telegram. Bullard will probably be leaving Jedda for Riyadh on either the 30th June or the following day so if you could see your way to letting me have an urgent reply by telephone we will try and get the telegram off to Bullard before he leaves. A similar letter is going to Blaxter at the Colonial Office and Donaldson at the Burma Office.Copy (E 3364/1022/25) ~ r o. 109. (878/233/22). •V .1 . • SL 4229 1937 INDIA DIRECT (Ti\ J c§) i /British Legation, J edda. 1st June, 1937. Sir, In the ’’Umm al Qura” of May 11th there appeared a notice by the Ministry of Finance stating that a Royal Command had authorised the exemption of Saudi nationals, during a period of four lunar months every year, from the 16th of Safar to the 15th of Jumadi al Thani, from the tax known as koshan which is levied on journeys from Jedda to Mecca or Medina. This period is the slack season from the time when the return rush of pilgrims is over until about the date when pilgrims for the next season begin to arrive. 2. I bring this regulation to your notice because it involves discrimination against foreigners. As is usual in this country figures are not easy to obtain, but the position appears to be that whereas during the four months in question Saudi subjects will pay no koshan , foreigners will have to pay koshan at the rate of two gold pounds per head (about £3.8.0.) for a journey to Medina and back, and eight riyals (about fourteen shillings) per head for a journey to Mecca and back. It is to be noted that although total exemption for Saudi nationals is quite a new thing, discrimination to some extent existed before; for in the last pilgrimage season non—Saudis paid kosha n at the rate of 5% gold pounds per head for a journey to Medina and back and The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C. , M.P. , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , &amp;c.and 14 riyals for a journey to Mecca and back, while the rates for Saudi nationals travelling to these places were 2 gold pounds and 8 riyals respectively. This discrimination, however, did not form the subject of any protest, as it seems reasonable to treat all foreigners as pilgrims during the pilgrim season and to tax them at pilgrim rates. But it appears to me that discrimination during the rest of the year is on a different footing. The distinction, if any is made, ought to be between residents, whether Saudi or non- Saudi, and non-residents, since the latter can all be considered as pilgrims. 5. I beg to draw your attention to two aspects of the matter. In the first place, it is clear that Ibn Saud, by the new regulation, is once more granting a privilege to Hejazi travellers: in other words we have here yet another proof that the King is obliged to try to conciliate his Hejazi subjects. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah took the view that the regulation, whether intended to do so or not, might induce foreigners to adopt Saudi nationality; my Dutch colleague, however, does not think that there will be a serious tendency in this direction among Dutch subjects. At any rate, the King evidently feels obliged to go so far as to sacrifice a certain amount of revenue as the price of the loyalty of his Hejazi subjects; a bad omen for the next pilgrimage season. 4. The second aspect is the question of discrimination against British subjects. There is no question of an infringement of most favoured nation rights even if we were entitled to such rights by treaty, for all foreigners are treatedtreated alike, I have been considering the question whether any formal protest or caveat on general grounds of national or reciprocal treatment, or based on the specific terms of Article 5 of the Treaty of Jedda ('it being understood that the principles of international law in force between independent governments should be respected'), ought to be made* I have found no clear guidance in Oppenheim 1 s ’International Law 1 ; he says, on page 553 of the edition of 1928, that 'A state can make (aliens) pay rates and taxes, and can even compel them, in case of need, and under the same conditions as citizens , to serve in the local police and local fire brigade'. This seems to imply that such service could not be demanded from foreigners if the subjects of the state were exempt. Similarly, while we can, and no doubt must, admit that our nationals should share the burden of local taxation, we are surely entitled to protest if they are called upon to pay a tax from which the citizens of the country are exempt, except in the form of special fees such as registration fees and fees for permis de sejour , or as a special tax on pilgrims whose stay in the country, though short, necessitates the setting up of a relatively elaborate administrative organisation. 5. I have discussed the matter with those of my colleagues who might be expected to take useful and reasonable action. My Turkish colleague considers that there is unfair discrimination in the regulation, but does not seem disposed to take any action. My Dutch colleague says that he has reported the new arrangements to his government; but he too seems inclined to take no action, as he is of the opinion that internal taxation in this country is in any case in a confused and inchoate state. On the 20th May, however, inthe course of conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza, I spoke about the new regulations, saying that they seemed to me to involve unfair discrimination against British subjects, and therefore to be contrary to the provisions of the Treaty of Jedda. Fuad Bey did not question this argument, but only said that he would discuss the matter in Riyadh and let me know the result. While waiting for his reply I have the honour to request instructions as to the position from the point of view of international law, and as to my future action. Should I see Fuad Bey again before receiving your instructions I propose to suggest to h,im, without binding Kis Majesty 1 s Government, that the only discrimination which would have a reasonable basis would be that described at the end of paragraph two above; i.e. discrimination between residents and non-residents. 6.
