With the cash balance which the state had at the end of last financial year, the state treasury now has a cash balance of Rs.3,97,150/-.

Muscat, ih &amp;'tli July 1981» 191 S ir, With reference to my letter No.898 dated the 29th May, I have the honour to forward in original an Arabic letter which I have received from H,H» the Sultan of Muscat, the purport of which is that he cannot accept the reduction in the amount paid from the state treasury for his personal expenditure, apparently owin^ to the fact that he has surrendered the income of G-wadur to the state treasury. It will be remembered that previously he had treated Gwadur as a private estate. fue Sultan had himself of his own initiative directed that Q-wadur should be included in the central custom control, openly with the idea that the inclusion of this lucrative port would make more certain the regular payment to him of ills RS.10,000/' a month. When the Sultan mentioned the matter to me I naturally encouraged him to hand G-wadur^T'^-^ especially as there had been many complaints as to tne customr management there under Muhammad HeEmoo, nt tne same time I gave no assurance to His Highness that this would ensure the invariable payment to nim of his full alloHance^ At the present time the financial stability cT the state is of the first importance. It is for this reasonthat the Sultan's allowance nas temporarily been reduced* f Owing to certain unforseen worli conditions the future is not yet clear. Should .^e state linances at this early stage become embarrassed, the Bultan must realise that he stands a very good ohance of finding himself penniless* This temporary reduction- is entirely in his own interest* It seem*obvious that he does not understand this* This question is closely bound up in the general question of the Sultans attitude to milch I have i eferred Lo elsewhere. I should be grateful for your instructions as lo what answer to send to the S Itan. At present I have only sent a formal acknowledgement of the fetter, a copy of which I enclose* You may consider an answer assuring him that the reduction is only tempoary and that G-overnment hope shortly to discuss the whole question with him sufficient for the moment * The Sultan's letter has been forwarded in original as I have not with iue an Arabic clerk* I xiave only kept a rough translation myself, I should be most grateful if you could return to me a copy, I have the honour to be Sir, your most obedient servant Political A^ent, Muscat. / /W ZxJ- c cull ljuil o/ tk U Cxyixt cu- (*o iXaJS cl CX jcl I^ /' (juCZZT C^U!&gt;r s; ■ ■ Froffi- H.H.

I have received your letter dated Slst May, No.865, and read it with much pleasure. With regard to your remark about the matter of the revenue and income of my Government and your proposal that as the position of the trade is not satisfactory the receipts will be diminished temporarily for a short while in these months on account of which.economy is necessary in my Government expenses and that my Government require new expenses for the management of its affairs. In the circumstances I may not get my private expenses in full and you have warned me that I am responsible for the payment of Rs,10000 on account of the allowances of the Shaikhs and that it would be well if I agree now to pay half of the amount during my stay in India. I beg to inform you, my friend, that.I know this and do not deny what you have advised me and I think I have taken the precaution before hand so that no deduction be demanded in my expenses temporarily like last year though it was repaid to me later on. In view of the fact that I knew the receipts were not regular in those days T agreed to a specific time (to the reduction) as I had another income to meet the deduction which was demanded from me, and that was the receipts of my town Gwadur. In this year I did not take the receipts of Gwadur and have added it to the Treasury of my Government at Muscat and undoubtedly you are aware of this. I am sure the receipts of Gwadur are enough without deducting anything from the original amount of Rs.10000 paid to me. With regard to the allowances of the Shaikhsiit does not it is Exceed Rs.3000 and perhaps/less than that amount. I cannot accept less than Rs.10000. You are aware that the receipts of Gwadur can meet the deduction demanded. I do not think that you will deny that the expenses of India are very heavy as it is not hidden from you and may say that your Government will doubtless think over my expenses here and I am confident that they&lt;s&gt; /? thoy will agree to my refusal to the deduction of anything from ] my private expenses as I do not like to become indebted. I forwarded a telegram to yoU on the 7th June and as the receipts of Gwadur is to be paid to the Treasury I cannot accept unless it In conclusion I trust that our friendship may endure.'H' 13/ft. 7 (Julmarg, Kaehiair.

The letter, judging by the atrociousness of the Arabic, seems to have been drafted by the Sultan himself in a fit of temper. It is not in my opinion, neceseary to take notice of the assertions made in it or of the manner in which they have been expressed. In view of the fact that due to Lhe improvement in the state finances, the payment of Rs.10,000 - p.m. has been continued to him under the instructions contained in your telegram No.1502 of the third instant, nox answer is necessary atall.

We ask your honour to submit to the Hon'ble the Political Resident and the respecoed Indian Government that we do not accept the reduced allowance which has been sent to us by our state with the advice of the British Agent at Muscat whether it is temporary or permanent.

Sir, in April last the general s€ump in trade, scarcity and restriction of export of foodstuffs from India and other causes so diminished the Income of the ' us cat Customs Department, which produces by far the greater part of the State revenue, that it becctne urgently necessary to retrench. The political Agent suggested among other retrenchments that the Sultan's allowance should be temporarily reduced to B? 5,000/- per mensem. In view of the fact that in Foreign and political Depart ment memorandum Jfo. 1496 dated the 6th October 1920 paragraph 2 (l) the aovernmcnt of India had proposed to fix thp Sultan's allowance at B* 15,000/* ^en out of us cat, and in their memorandum No. 1766 dated 1st ^ &amp; f December 1920 the grant of the B? 10,000/- allowance was made conditional on the capability of the State Finances to meet his charge no reference to Government appeared necessary, so I assented to 'r.

Up to now I have not acted on the Political Agent 1 s suggestions as I hoped the Sultan would gradually understand 'lis po sition, but I have cone to the cnnclusion that he is not likely to do so. X therefore beg to support the suggestion of the ai\4 Political Agentj^to suggest that, if tho ^overn^ent of India see fit the Sultan may be summoned to Delhi at convenient time and his position explained to him by you His Highness•s present ider is that he has nrryay div-sto himself of all responsibility for the administration of the State, and thrown it on to us, and that he can live at his ease in India on a comfortable allowance and in pursuance of this idea His Highness never even answersthe (|ueries of hi a Ministers* I would miggest that It be mde clear to His Highnose that ho cannot divost him self of the responsibilities of his position and that Government consider him personally responsible for such things m the appointnent of inistors and high officials for knowing the financial conl!tion of his State, for fixing salaries, for looking after his fanily nd relatives, for bein^ ?.cquainted with political con&lt;|itions etc, and that he makes the fact clear in a public dec- lan &amp;ion at f uacat» If sonothing of this sort is not done, I think that public opinion will gradually fix an idea that the Political Agent and the British Cfovemnent are responsible for the administration of the Muscat State and that we are trying to assume a protectorate over It.

Bray,C,I.E. ,C .B .E, ,1.0. S., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, DELHI. Subject;- Muscat State Finances, Report on for 1920-21 and Budget estimate for 1921-22. t Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with ray letter Ho.156-S. si&amp;ted 1st July regarding the Muscat Finances, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the Ho.1569 dated 12th October 1921 .5 information of the Gotpernment of India, a oopy of a letter from the Political Agent, Muscat, reporting on the accounts for the year 1920-21 {1st October l920-30th September 1021) and forwarding the budget estimates for 1921-1922. 8. Mr Wingate has explained the accounts for the past year lucidly and in detail and given the reasons for the decrease in the revenue which had been estimated for the year. Undoubtedly the chief of these were the increase in the value of silver and consequent depreciation of the dollar compared to the rupee, the heavy slump in trade, and the stoppage of the penal Zakat. Taking these things into consideration I think the State may be considered fortunate to have finishedthe year with a balance of Rs.9,350/-. g. The last quarter of the year showed a deficit of Hs.61,45l/- but the excess expenditure was all incurred duringduring June and July when largo suejs had to b© paid out on aoaount cf the Musoat Levy Corps, During the last two months of the year the revenue exceeded the expenditure by nearly Es«S8,000/-. ^hese two months are of course the two best revenue producing months of the year owing to the date season, but even so, I think, this considerable excess of revenue shows a revival of trade and promises better things for next year. 4. The Political Agent's suggestion that the Muscat State should keep an account with the Imperial Bank of India at Bombay seems to me to be a good one, and if the Govem- ment of India see no objection, I propose to authorize him to recommend the State to carry it into effect. 6. Mr. Wingate, who is just about to leave Muscat, has during his stay managed to reorganize the Customs and the State Finances, and greatly to improve the financial position of the Sultan, and for this, in my opinion, he deserves great credit. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.® ft U). The fall in the price of silver^ anil the consequent decrease in tne rupee value of the dollar. During the financial year i919-192u tiie value of the dollar was R8 .SJ36 during last financial year the dollar, averaged Rs,192 or ■ 15 per cent lower. As trade is in dollars or the rupee equivalent, a fall in the value of the dollar means a decrease in purchasins power, and - so a decrease in trade and revenue, which in Muscat lependa entirely on trade. (2). The fall in prices. Taking the chief article of xxpaidK import, rice, the price of Karachi bellum, the most ^ w ■ ^ common variety, averaged R8.36/- during 3.93.9-^0, and last year. The customs receipts uave 'been correspondingly affected. (3), The-penal zakat of 19^0. Tixis zakat of 85 $ brougiit nearly one lakh of rupees to the state during 19X9-1920. It was not operative during last financial year. (4). The world wide trade depression. , This affected Muscat as it affectwd other countries. Merchants were afrail to make purchases anl Jiell up their stocks. In Vusciat trade almost leased in February and March. (5 J. The delay in taking over the customs at G-wadur and Sohar. Gwadur was only taken over half way through the financial year, and Sohar nas still to be taken over. Both these ports are most lucrative from the revenue point of view. 6;. The absence of Abdul Salam, the Customs Director luring the greater part of thw „ ear. This officer's energetic administration ensured th*? maximum revenue being obtained. \ * / 1!fakinQ theae alverse factors Into conei Aeration it may be aimittea that Muflcat nas achlevel a succeflflful financial year. A penisal of the letallel fl^urea of revenue will show that the decrease in revenue is almost entirely due to tne lecrense in the Muscat anil Muttrah customs receipts f while outside purts show a substantial increase. In other worls trade depression has accounted for the decrease, not Inefficiency of administration. In fact had it not been for tne increased efficiency of une airu.ni strati on affairs would have been much worse. gxpenditure luring Comparing the actual expenditure with the budget estimates, it will be seen that the former is a ac&amp;kk lakh less. The two instalments of tne loan were met in the year, and some Rs.eo^oOu/- were spent in buying necessary motor boats.. Due to delay tne expenditure on the levy wa^ not as much as had been anticipated. Miscellaneous charges however proved a heavy item, rhe other items call for no comment. It may be not-^d however that the economies effeated, and the reduction of the Sultan's privy purse have been fully justified in the sequel, as it was by these step; alone that the state was able to survive the year successfully. # BUDO-ST ^STBIATBS FOR With two years actuals compile! by me personally fron tne stats &lt;*ooou)it8, it is possible to form a possibly closer estimate of the- future revenue, ani expeniiture of the state. The figures for revenue have been compiled from these actuals, while those for expeniiture ..«ye been arrive! at from the official lists of salaries etc which have been very carefully revised. There is little to note on the revenue side, except, that a larger income is expected from G-wadur as a full year 1 a income will be obtained from this i ort instead pf a half year's./2- u* la In 11a. U jl &amp; v ZS ^ , (| Ab this report may be lescrlbel as ray swan sons Muscat, I venture to emphasise a few points connected with the financial alministration of the Muscat state# The first ia that It is upon the success &amp;cX of the finances that tne whole existence of the Muscat state lepenls. peac« n&lt;%H been establishel and the state has now an efficient lefence force. It can pay its way, but lue to the chamcteristics of all arabs c»ntt of the Uuscat Arabs in particular, the state finances need unremitting personal care, and the Knowledge on the part of the state authorities tiat this care Is exercised. t The second is sooner or later some regulation of the excessive amount paid to the members of the ruling family will be called for. This amount is nearly one third of the revenues, and is by far the largest head of expenditure. This is, of course, a matter for the Sultan himself, but, I venture to think, it is jue that should be 0 made responsible, and that possibly the most satisfactory an' econorileal method would be to grant His Highness a fixed privy purse which would include the allowances to his family, etnd to leave It to him to spend it all upon himself or c on them as he thinks fit. Tue third is that expenditure will always be apparently high as Muscat, In contradistinction to tne other states of tne Crulf, is a state that actually has to rule. It has over two hundred miles of quite thickly inhabited coast, and a powerful and often nostiie hinter- -land. Establishments a I forces are necessary on a scale which would appear absurd in a place like Bahrain or Kowelt.On the expenliture si^e tlae increase unrler the neai 'Pensions anfl subsidies' is lue to an adjustment ( 'between this heai anl tne neal 'Aim nistrative staff'. The estimates for Military and Marine charges have been very carefully compilel by Captain McCarthy. Revenue is entimatel at Rs.10,95^400/- and expenditure at ^kx3c«^«x04x R8.iu,*A) f 000/-. Balance in the ntatg tre a sury and its utilisation. With the 1919-3,9^0 balance of R&amp;,6 § 2 t QQ0/- $ and last year ? s working balance of Rs.w^S^o/- the state now has a balance of Rs,3,35 # 150/-. X have frame I a supplementary estimate for Rs•70,000/- to be met out of this balance. This is composed of only two items. The repayment of Hs^u^UOO/- to British subjects who incurred losses in 1914 over the zakat, and R8.50 # 000/- for arms and equipment for the Muscat levies. The question )f whether tne Muscat Government is to pay for these does not seem yet to have been definitely decided, and In any case the exact cost of the articles s pplied has not yet been communicated by the G-overnment of India. Owin© to the uncertainty as to the financia stability of the state which still prevails, it is necessary tn nusband very carefully t us surplus balance. I wo d 1 propose however that it be utilised in a way that is advantageous to the state. X venture to sutSo^st that the state should at once open an account with the Imperial Bank of India at Bombay for Rs.50,000/-, anl that the subsidies paid to the Muscat Government in Muscat should be p^id in the future to their account at Bombay. If this is done the state woiPd repay the instalments of the loan also in Bombay by cheque on the bank. At the same time they would be abie to weet their obligations in Inlia for stores etc in a far easier way than is possible at present and would be able to finance the Sultan 1 whenelQgram Gode^ Prom - Trevor, Busiiire^ To - Foreign, Belhi.

I did not discuss the length of his stay for I had no desire to urge its px^olonga- tion till I taut saw its results. He said plainly he did not like to stay in Muscat but admitted freely his duty to be there if circumstances required his presence. I am inclined to think that if he continues to admit this^and to act on it when necessary^ a two months stay in Muscat is all that is ordinarily required. His Highness appeared to me quite conscious of his duties as a ruler but quite convinced of his inability and that of any Ministers ho could appoint to carry them out satisfactorily He is strong on the necessity of maintaining a British Officer for the Levy corps and on the desirability of a British Office-r as Wazir. He does not realise the difficulty of getting suit able officers for either post/ at salaries which the state could afford to pay. I think it would be good to retafcn the services of Captain McCarthy as Financial and Military Adviser but refrain from making any definite proposal about this at present. It is too early to say what benefits will accrue from the Sultan's presence in Muscat, so far he has shown a laudable desire to remedy the main evil in his state at present * the '71 0 tyrany of his brther Saiyid Hamad, Wali of Sohar » and a read- A iness to transact business required.

The presence of a British Officer with the Levies seems very desirable in order to Maiirtain their efficiency, and as long as Captain • cGarthy is so employed he could perhaps advise to some extent on financial matters as well, being I understand a Chartered Accountant. As regards a British Officer as Wasir I an not certain that it is necessary for the State to go to such expense and I think the Political Agent can do a good deal to advis in affairs with which the Wasir would deal.

Sir, In my letter Ho#14 C dated 14th March 1922 I mention ad that I thought it would be good to retain the serrices of Captain McCarthy as financial and Military Adriser to the Muscat Gorernraent, I ha¥e now the honour to submit at the request of His Highness the aultan a definite application for the loan of Captain McCarthy's serrices to the Muscat Government for another year from 1st September 1922, In this connection I may say that I myself am con- jrrinced that the services of a 3 ritish Officer are required by the Muscat Government at present for the supervision of the Levy Corps if not for its actual command. It is also very desireable for them to have an officer to act to some extent as auditor and organiser of their finances. It is hoped that one officer may be able to perform both these functions* The Levy Corps would be his primary concern, but his main duty in connection with it apart from seeing effic iency maintained would be to try to get it to exist as an efficient force without a British Officer. In his leisure S. G. P. I.—147 P. a. &amp; H. B. m .'s Consul, Muscat. -14-3-13. 1,440. _ from(g) from this work ho would ovorhaul the financial arrsmgenents of the luscat Govomment In a way it is neither desireable nor possible for the Political A^ent to do .//It is clear that Captain McCarthy is the officer most suited to the post. He is already in command of the Le^y Corps, he is better acquainted with it and with local conditions than any other officercan be and he has been rery successful so far in his work with the Le^y Corps and his dealings with the uscat Government and people. More ore r he already has some acquaintance with 1 uscat finance and is by business training an accountant. It is there fore yery desireable th^t his serTices should be secured. He himself is willing to serre in the capacity I have outuj-d that of Military and financial Adviser to the Muscat Goyemment- for one year from 1st Jeptember 1932^f unfortunately the services of Captain McCarthy cannot fee spared. His Highness the sultan requests that the services of another officer may be lent for this post. The terms offered v^ould be ,he same as in the case of Captain McCarthy vis pay of rank plus Hs.600/- a month staff pay. The officer selected would have to have a colloquial knowledge of Arabic or Persian, preferably the form er, as well as a knowledge of Hindustani. It would be advisable C think that he should be a candidate for the 3 J olitical Depart ment, He would then have a double interest in the work and would be gaining useful experience. His Highness the Sultan hopes very strongly however that it may be possible for Captain McCarthy to stay.

Sir, I have the honour to submit for your informa tion a copy of the Muscat State Budget for the year 1923 and of a review of le^st years finances by the Financial Adviser to the Muscat Government. The calander year of the Christian era has been fixed as the financial year instead of the period 1st October - 30th September. This enables the budget to be prepared at a more convenient season and i^-more convenient for statistical purposes. Care has been taken not to overestimate revenue or under estimate expenditure so that, but for the Zakat claim which I shall mention presently, the actual deficit at the close of the year should not in any case be greater than estimated. ]ti- is hoped that the control exercised by the Financial Adviser will make it muck less. At all events the repayments of the instalments of the Indian Government loan is amply secured^ In the course of last year the Muscat Govern ment accepted liability for the repayment of the extra Zakat levied from British subjects in 1914 , but asked that the terms of repayment should be settled at the closeo close of the financial year* I am now writing to them to ask that they should pay one fourth about dollars 10,000 of the claim now and one fourth each suceeding year in Januaiy till they are extinguished. I am also suggesting that they should extinguish all claims on this account where the claimants are willing to accept three fourth^of their claims for prompt payment* It will of course 'be entirely optional with the claimants whether they accept this or not. I trust these steps will meet with your approval* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. iCZ KAJOR, Political Agent &amp; H. M* s Consul, Muscat* A.* J• deC&lt; li ONo. F.A.2 of 19 2$. Mas cat 15th January 19 23. The Political Agent li Consul MASQAT* Sir, Mas oat State Fi nances,. I have the honour to forward herewith a Statement (Appendix 1) showing the Revenue and Expenditure or the Mas cat G-overnment for the Financial Year ist October 19 21 to 30th September 19 22; included therein I have also shown the estimated figures as compiled by Mr Wingate, I.C.S Political Agent, Mascat- It will be seen from this statement that there has been a considerable decrease in Customs Receipts from. Mascat and Mattrah, amounting to Rs. Ii46,300 C this figure includes the expenditure entailed in Landing charges which was not shown separately in the oudgetT* As my appointment as Financial Adviser was only confirrred on the 1st January, I regret I have not bean able to extract details of the items on which there has been a decrease of Revenue, however, the general fall in the prices of foodstuffs and other articles during the period under review has greatly affected the Customs receipts. The heavy fall in the receipts for the months of October.November and Becemoer can only be accounted for by the poor date season due to scanty rainfall. The steady depreciation of the Dollar must also be taken into consideration. The decrease of Rs.22*200 under Miscellaneos Revenue is compensated for by Zakat Revenue and as no estimate was shown under this head, it is presumed that 2akat was included by Mr Wingate under the heading Miscellaneous. Turning to the increase in expenditure the sum of Rs.15,000 under the heading H.R.Privy Purse represents repayment to the Sultan of a like amount deducted from his allowance in the previous financial year. Against an increase of Rs.28,100 under Administrative Charges the sum of Rs.il.eoo a decrease shown under Pensions and Subsidies must be deducted as certain items under this heading have been included under Administrative Charges. The decrease therefore of Rs.16,300 is accounted for by this item having been underestimated. Miscellaneous Expenditure which shows a deficit of Rs.36,060 was also underestimated. It must be borne in mind however that had efficient control been exercised over this item by the Finance Minister the amount would have been considerably less. mC&amp;LIQE-ii2£. In accordance with your desire that the f mancialfinancial year should be changed from let October to 1st January I have prepared the Budget for the period is t January 19 23 to 31st December 19 £3^ ana as a guide to tne estimates ^iven I have included in the same statement (Appendix 2) the actual figures for the period Ist January 19 id 2 to 3ist December 19 22. I would point out that in view of the steady depreciation of the Dollar I have estimated the opening balance at the rates as stated in this statement* An estimated increase of Rs. 10,600 under the head of Other Customs has been made ^o allow for the receipts from the ports which have been established in the A1 Saad country and which should prove to be good revenue producing places# Qau«&amp;ntine Revenue is shown as Rs«6000 as there was a balance of Rs.2000 outstanding from the British India Agents at the close of 19 22. Miscellaneous Revenue is decreased to Rs.15*000 as last years figures include the fine paid by the Al Saaa tribe. Sohar Revenue is shown for the first time in the Budget as this port has now been brought under the direct control of the Central Customs. . ., On the Expenditure siae will be shown a large decrease under Administrative Charges due to the reductions effected during the last few days. Subsidy for the Sheikhs of Sur was included with Administrative Charges last year. Customs Pay has been increased to allow for the staffing of new custom houses to be opened at various Ports- Miscellaneous Expenditure has been reduced as I have been able withinf the past few days to make considerable reductions under this Details of Military Expenditure are shown in Appendix 3. It will be seen that there is an estimated deficit of Rs,27,500 for the current year leaving an estimated balance of R8«cl &gt; 36 , 20C on 31st December 19 23* No provision has been made by me in this Budget for ^he repayment of the large amount due to British Subjects#- Without being unduly optimistic I consider that now that the appointment of a Financial Adviser to the Mascat Government has been sanctioned there is no reason why the State Account should not show a slight surplus instead of an estimated deficit. Already I have been able . to effect a large saving m expenditure and during the course of the year no doubt further economies can be made. Revenue from Other Ports and also Miscellaneous Revenue if properly supervised should yeild a much higher income. I have the honour to be Sir, Your obedient servant, Captain.

I have received a memorandum from Rae (dated 26th Pe- bruary 19S3) in which he says; ; , 'in 19SO His Highness the sultan expressed a desire to buy a house in Dehra Dun. The correspondence ending with your endorsement No. J531-S dated 6th December 19S0 shows that he was discouraged but not actually prohibited from doing so. 1 gather the chief objection to the purchase of the house was that the sultan wanted to buy it from State funds. He has now confided to me that he has bought the house in the name of Khan Bahadur Ahmed Shubaily paying for it from his privy ' purse. To avoid possible trouble about it after his death he wishes to hold it in his own name and asks if he can be permitted to do so. I trust it will be possible to meet His Highness 1 s wishes in this matter.* Apparently the Dehra Dun house was after all bought (in this connection please refer to 'Uscat telegram 20S6 of 10th October 1920) in the name of Khan Bahadur Ahmed shubaily, and the question of purchase by an independent ruler thus evaded. • I do now know if the Government of India woujd be pre- / p^red to accede to the sultan^ present request and allow the • \ fi house to be transferred to him. If it would be objectionable to transfer the title deeds of the house to the SUltan of Muscat, perhaps they could be transferred to him in his private capacity In the name under which, 1 understand, he resides incognito in India, if this is feasible. de S.

They will pay three fourths of the whole xxiiaa claim in final settlement this July if they consider that the state of their finances permit it.

These figures were prepare1 unlr my instructions by tne Financial Adviser, with special reference to tne alarming state of the late market ani tae increasing comr. or- •cial ieoay of Muscat. As has been previously pointel out the last six larger montns i tne year proluce usually a :on»i^ rably revenue turn the first six months. The season is a more favourable one iron the tracing point of vfcew, an : the late ox ^ort, wnicix gives the zakat or five per cent octroi, takes place luring this period. This year at tne beginning of tne lat^ eason the price of uscat lates on the Bombay market was less than one half want it was last year,, wnich was by no means a ^ool one. It has since risen to about two thirds, anl is not expeotti to rise appreciably higher, ne system aloptei therefore in calculating the revenue for the last six ontii of tne year nas been to take the custoius revenue as similarto that aurlng the- first six months of the year, an! to a4i to last year's revenue from the same source. The original estimates pronoBc3 a revenue of Rs. 10,74, 400/- an'! an exoen3iture of 'Rs^ll,0l,is?00/- showing a deficit of Rs.97,5 0/-. But in the estimates no provision was male for the liquiiation of the zak t claims of British subfects. These amount to Rs.47,350/-, ani txieir payment luring tne year • brings the estimatei ieficlt up to Rs .74,750/-. The revistel estimates show a revenue of Rs.9,83,350/- an! an sxpeniiture of Rs.11,06,353/- Slving an anticipatei ieficit of Rs.l,33,003/-. The opening balance on ist January was Rs.l i 63,V .)/-» balance on 1st January is estimatel at Rs.40,6^7/-« It will be seen that including the akat claims the expenditure as originally estimatel was Rs.il,49,150/- as against Rs.11,06,353/* in the revised estimates. Expenditure has Ih^reior® been reduced by S,'97/-, which is v^ry creditable, Revenue has nowevor decreased Xifisjaby !\s• CI,0^0/-• A perusal of a ctail« &lt; figure- will ?»how that is almost entirely account d for by th« fall in customs -everue ^ in which is inclu'cd the ^ate octroi } 9 especially at Muscat and Muttrah. Considering the iuscat and Muttrah figures for tue years 10 1,1922 and 1923 we have 1933 Rs.4,07,643/-. or a progressive decrease of appoximately R8.83,000/« per year.

With reference to my letter No. 72-S., dated the 10th February 1923, I liave the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a letter (No. 18-R., dated the 31st August 1923), from the Political Agent, Muscat, reporting on the condition of the State finances during the first half of 1923 and submitting a revised estimate of income and expenditure for the whole year. 2. The Political Agent's report shows a satisfactory reduction in expendi ture, as compared with the original estimates at the beginning of the year, but it also records a marked decrease in revenue which, in the opinion of the Political Agent, is due to : — (i) the low price of Muscat dates on the Bombay market, and (n) a general decrease in the trade of Muscat, which is evidenced by the fall in Customs revenue at Muscat and Muttrah. , il, 3. The Political Agent's proposals for restoring the economic problem of the State raise^ exceedingly large questions—practically a reversal of our policy in Muscat for the past one hundred years. In the absence of Mr. Wingate, whose relief can only be expected a fortnight before I leave, and in view of the early arrival of my successor, I hesitate to express views which might possibly be at variance with those of Colonel Trevor. I would only say that I think perhaps that Mr. Wingate has not in his report allowed sufficiently for a world-wide de pression of trade through which we are passing at the moment; and it is con ceivable that for this reason his report is unduly pessimistic. No. 18-11. of 1923, dated Muscat, the 31st August 1923. From— R. E. L. Wingate , Esq., I .C.S., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty 's Consul, Muscat, To —The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Knox, C.S.I., C.LE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Busliire. With reference to Major Rae's letter No. 101, dated the 20th January 1923, I have the honour to forward a further report on the finances of the Muscat State giving the actuals of the first six months of the year together with a revised estimate of the income and expenditure during the year. These figures were prepared under my instructions by the Financial Adviser, with special reference to the alarming state of the date market and the increas ing commercial decay of Muscat. As has been previously pointed out the last six months of the year | roduce usually a considerably larger revenue than the first six months. The season is a more favourable one from the trading point of view, and the date export, which gives the zakat or five per cent, octroi, takes place during this period.' This year at the beginning of the date season the price of Muscat dates on the Bombay market was less than one half what it was last year, which was by no means a good one. It has since risen to about two-thirds, and is not expected to rise appre ciably higher. The system adopted therefore in calculating the revenue for the last six months of the year has been to take the customs revenue as similar to that during the first six months of the year, and to add to it a date octori revenue calculated on the basis of half, last year's revenue from the same source. The original estimates proposed a revenue of Rs. 10,74j400 and an expendi ture of Rs. 11,01,900 showing a deficit of Rs. 27,500. But in the estimates no provision was made for the liquidation of the zakat claims of British subjects. These amount to Rs. 47,250, and their payment during the year brings the esti mated deficit up to Rs. 74,750. -j The revised estimates show a revenue of Rs. 9,83,350 and an expenditure of Rs. 11,06,353 giving an anticipated deficit of Rs. 1,23,003. The opening balance on 1st January 1923 was Rs. 1,63,700, so the balance on 1st January 1924 is estimated at Rs. 40,697.2 1923 we have— 1921 1922 1923 Rs, 5,74,302 4,90,700 4,07,642 or a progressive decrease of approximately Rs. 83,000 per year. These figures are significant and point unquestionably to a progressive decrease in the trade of Muscat. I have repeatedly pointed out that Muscat is dying commercially at an alarm ing rate and that there is no reason why it should ever revive. The conditions which gave Muscat its prosperity have disappeared never to return, and it can now only look to the actual export of Oman, that is dates, and to the actual import for Oman, that is rice and piece-goods. With falling markets the income from these will progressively decrease. It is not anticipated that a state of equilibrium can be reached before 1925. After that it is possible that there may be a very slight improvement, but it is improbable that the condition ot even two years ago will again be reached. The trade stagnation in India has of course an overpowering influence on Muscat trade, as India is practically speak ing Muscat's only market. It is therefore extremely probable that Muscat State will be bankrupt next year and unable to meet her obligations, unless rapid action is taken to provide some new source of revenue. On the expenditure side almost every possible step has been taken to reduce expenditure. The levies are essential to the existence of the state, but even in this case I have instructed the Military Adviser to fill up no vacancies in order gradually to reduce the strength to 200. The only reduction in salaries that could be made is in the payments made to the Sultan and the members of the ruling family. I consider that this could be done by paying to the Sultan a lump sum yearly and making him responsible for its distribution in such way as he thought fit. On the other hand this would cause great discontent and it would be very difficult to get the Sultan to agree to it. On the revenue side customs are the only source of income. The raising of the rate of duty from five to ten per cent, would automatically restore the econo mic equilibrium of the State and remove all source of anxiety. Theoretically this would mean that we should have to obtain the agreement of France and the United States, but in actuality Muscat does not trade as an importer with either of these countries. It seems possible that it would only be necessary for the Sultan to announce to these Governments, after agreement with us, and through us, that he was raising the rate of import duty from five to ten per cent, from a certain date. If this was accompanied by a statement from Government that they had agreed to this as -far as they were concerned, and that they had been approached by the Sultan to obtain on his behalf the formal agreement of the other powers with whom he is in treaty relation, it is difficult to see what difficulties they would make, .especially as now they do not trade with Muscat, and have no interests or subjects in Muscat with the exception of one American missionary. As regards the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause it may be noted that no complaint could be made by a British importer as to the increased rate of duty if agreed to by Government, unless he could show that a French or American importer was charged less, and owing to the absence of such persons the question would not arise. No apprehension need be entertained that the increased rate of duty will hamper trade. It is a light rate compared with those in force in other countrieSj and the only, trade of Muscat is in necessities, that is food and cloth.I would therefore make the following definite proposals^ (1) That the principle of raising the import duty from five to ten per cent. by a notification amending Article 6 of the Commercial Treaty of 1891 be definitely accepted. (2) That the Sultan of Muscat immediately on his return from Dhufar, probably at the end of October, be acquainted with the financial situation and the proposals of Government, and that he should then initiate the definite proposal for amendment. (3) That we should be in a position to assent to this amendment at once, so as to permit it to come into force, if possible, from the 1st Decem ber this year, leaving the assent of France and America to be obtained later through the usual channels. If my opinion on Muscat affairs is worth anything, I cannot too strongly stress the urgent necessity for action, if we are not to be involved again in the vicious circle from which with difficulty we extricated ourselves in 1920. Finally, with great diffidence, I would venture the suggestion that the time has come for a definite reconsideration of our policy and commitments with Muscat, as this question arises directly out of the present situation in Muscat. It is assumed that the reasons for our very great interest in this state were (a) Strategic im portance, (6) Trade, (c) Protection of our subjects. It is quite clear that our interest in Muscat on these three questions has, been greatly diminished, if it has not been very nearly extinguished. I will not elaborate this subject as it is clearly beyond my province, but the putting of a definite term to our practically direct control of Muscat and its Sultan, as has been recently done in the case of Iraq, would possibly merit consideration. Even our small loan, of which about half has been repaid, is secured on the subsidies.

I think, perhaps, I dil not emphasize sufficiently during our conversation the other day the really serious necessity of increasing the Customs rates; in fact it comes to this, that if they are not raised before the middle of next year, Muscat will have to ask the Government of India for some form of relief unless the latter are prepared to acquiesce in a state of anarchy and disorder in the dominions of His High- -ness. Apart from the trade dislocation which would thereby ensue, and which would affect Indians more than anybody else, and the dangers of having an anarchical state in such close proximity to India,this would mean Hobble Lieut-Colonel A.

I have been at great pains to avoid undue pessimism on this question but a careful scrutiny of the financial statements has convinced me that no other conclusion is possible more particularly as the measures I have noted for improvement of theleal n laboyir- PB. /fhich a year Lstration b of the at of the five years ost is of rest to s proviiei o avoli undue ,1 scrutiny of me that no Lcularly as smt of the X S 6 , the revenues cannot In any case have maeh financial effect for some months to come. A.02) .Note on Muscat State Finances for information of POLITICAL RESIDENT. The Financial Adviser's penultimate statement for the year 1923 shows a loss oh the year's working of just over a Lakh of Uf- rupees compared with one and a^lakhsin 1922, This has been brought about mainly by better administration and rigid economy an# thus there is not so much room for improve- -ment on these lines as at the end of 1922. It is now possible to foretell^date of the State's bankruptcy with some accuracy unless existing sources of revenue are improved or new sources found. The balance in hand at the end of the year will be roughly Rs 58,000 and with care this can be made to last till about next July under present arrangements. It may be possible to increase the revenue under the follow- -ing heads Sohar Customs. By collecting these directljr instead of faiming them out. The present contract is untij July next. Other Customs. By more frequent inspections and a further tightening of crontrol. Zaka t. By chnging the system to a poll tax on trees instead of a fixed tax on the estimated crop. This will probably meet with considerable opposition from H.H. and of course from the date grove owners. There are not many items on the expenditure side which can sai safely be cut down. The most obvious is the Sohar administration which is spending considerably more than it should. The others are to halve the privy purse; to refuse to spend such a large amount on the parasitical Royal Pamily and to cut off the rations of the MilitaryMilitary, These three changes will breed considerable opposi- -tion and discontent and it may on political grounds 'be found inadvisable to carry out in their entirety. A New sources of revenue which it may 'be possible to institute are (1) Excise licenses for spirits^nd opium and allied drugs. f2^ Municipal tax on house-holders in Muttra. m , (3) A poll tax on all acunOio coming into nuiotra from the interior. It is not ipossible to estimate the exact effect of the above measures on the Muscat financeqbut it may be taken 1 that they are merely palliatives and do not touch the main question of balancing the revenue and expenditure. The only real measure of relief will he to increase the Customs duties to li- % or 10%, preferably the latter, which should cause all anxiety to cease. If it is not found possible to carry out this augnentation the only farther suggestion X have to make is to invite the Government of India to pay for the Muscat levy Corps.

Muscat Finances Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to Memorandum N0.749-X. dated Ist October 1923 from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department calling for my views on the questions raised 'by Mr. Wingate in his letter No.lB-R. dated 21st August 1923. 2. I have delayed replying to the ahovementioned Memoran dum until I had an opportunity of visiting Muscat, and this I have now done^having 'been there on the 5th and 6th December# While at Muscat I discussed the question of the Muscat Finances thoroughly with the Political Agent and the Financial Adviser. I am afraid the financial position of the Muscat State is not at all good. As Mr.Wingate pointed out in his letter abovementioned there is a progressive decline in Muscat Customs receipts of nearly a laKh per annum. This undoubtedly A- pointa considerable decrease in trade, but that it means an absolutely corresponding decrease in trade^I am by no means so sure. The Council recently felt constrained to dismiiss the second of the Egyptian Directors for inefficiency - the first one having voluntarily retired some little time before - andinorease of Customs receipts, and that in the end the Muscat State would be able (as of course it should do) to pay for his deputation. / 4» If* Mr•Bower*s services can be utilized in this way^ and he is willing to tackle the Muscat Customs problems, I feel sure as mentioned above, a considerable increaae of ^■ ouf - oo will result* While at Muscat I went into the possibility of raising revenue by other taxes. The only other taxes which could bo suggested were (l) Excise Licenses for spirits, opium and allied druggs* (2) Municipal tax on house holders in Muttrah and (5) Octroi on all camels coming into Muttrah from the interior, and I instructed the Finan cial Adviser to go into these and see whether they were feasible and what revenue they were likely to produce - hothing very much, I fear, less than J- a lakh all told* 5* I attach^ for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter from the Financial Adviser together A- with its enclosure statement showing the actual revenue of Muscat State from 1st January 1983 to 30th November 19S3 together with the estimated revenue for December 19S3* This shows that there will be a deficit on this year r s working of Rs.1,05,272 in spite of expenditure being reduced to the lowest possible level* I rather fear that the improv ed Customs Revenue and the result of the above taxes will hardly cover this deficit, and in any case will not be sufficient to place Muscat State Finances on a sound footing* 6* It results from the above that it will be necessary either to increase revenue permanently or reduce expenditure very considerably* The first can only be done, as far as I can see, by raising the ad valorem rate of Customs duty from 5^ to 7i$, or even 10^* It will be remembered that when I was at Muscat in 1910 the late Sultan sayyid Faisal denounced the Commercial Treaty of 1891 simply with a view to getting the Customs duty raised to 7-|$, and to do this is practically the only object to revising the Treaty. The Customsand I think that without doubt a proportion of the Customa Hevenue haa been f and is being^lost through inefficiency and poasibly dishonesty. Further I believe we have the means of this 'to otvp 3. Mr. Bower ^ho was originally deputed to reorganize the Bahrain Customs will have finished his job there before the end of January, and his deputation has recently been extended for another 3 months to try and settle the Kuwait Hejd Customs difficulties* It has, however, been apparent for some time that Shail&lt;h Ahuied has no desire to settle the«e, difficulties, and just recently Bin saud has replied to Colonel Knox's suggestion for settlement to the effect that he has no desire to do so either. It is thus useless to rstain Mr.Bower for the service for which his additional period of deputation was sanctioned. I understand that Mr. Bower 1 s services are not required for the moment in India and that he has been promised leave in the spring, in the circumstances he will apparently be more or less free for 2f months - from say 14th January to 28th March, and I venture to aslc that he may be deputed to inspect f and if time permits ^reorganize the Muscat and Oman Customs Depart ment. Though I do not date to hope for such a large increase - averaging Rs.1150/- per diem - in receipts as he has achieved at Bahrain, I fancy Mr. Bower could raak^a consider able inprovement. In present conditions, however, Muscat certainly cannot afford to pay him his salary of Rs.8000/- per mensemj perhaps the State could pay half. If Mr. Bower could achieve a substantial increase in Customs revenue of course the State could pay up the balance. I venture to ask whether Government would be prepared to pay Hr.Bower his salary and allowances while at Muscat on the scale on which he is being paid at Bahrain, and allow the Muscat State to pay it back if and when its customs revenues have increased as a result of Mr.Bower's efforts. I feel almost certain that Mr. Bower's deputation would result in an immediate increaseCustoms revenue would / of oourse / he nearly doubled if the / rate were raised to lOJ^ though perhaps not quite as volume of import might 'be reduced. I very much doubt, however, whether ■ it would be suitable to raise the rate of duty in the manner / suggested by Mr*Wingate, without previous reference to Prance and America / who have treaties with Muscat which also fix rate of Customs duty at This point, however, is one for the Government of India or His Majesty's Government to decide, I am not qualified to express any useful^ opinion on the subject• w J t in regard to reduction of expenditure the only thing I can suggest is to reduce the Sultan^ Privy Purse from 10,000 a month to 5000/- temporarily and with the proviso that the difference will be made good / at all events for the period H.H. is in Muscat,if and when the State Finances permit. The only other relief in expenditure which I can suggest is within the power of the Government of India to accord and might take the form of (a) a remission of repayment of the loan or at all events a postponement of the repayment of instalments for say 5 years* (b) a contribution to the cost of the Levy Corps (c) an increase in the subsidy* atefekaKS Of these I think (c) may be ruled out straight away. In favour of (b) it may be urged that the institution of the Levy Corps has saved the Government of India the very large expenditure involved in keeping a regiment at Muscat, on the whole, however, I consider (a) much the best course and recommend it to the Government of India for favourable consideration. If the Government of India are disposed to consider this proposition favourably I beg to recommend (l) the deputation of Mr-Bower for 2^ months to inspect Muscat Customs and see if there is any method of increas ing receipts. .

It is possible that the measures suggested in Sections (1) (8) and (3) above will result in sufficient increase of revenue and decrease of expenditure to enable the repayments of the loan to be recommenced within the next year or two* Cf, in the meanwhile the Government of India and His Majesty's Government will perhaps be pleased to consider the question of agreeing to an increase of the rate of Customs Duty; this can be done in connection with the Revision of the Commercial Treaty which has now been on the tapis, but hanging fire, for several years# If they decide to agree to an increase in the rate of djity no doubt they will consider the question of arranging the matter with the French and American Governments before the final draft of the revised Treaty is approved. /^, in regard to the suggestion made by Mr.Wingate to put a definite term to our practically direct control of Muscat, I venture to think that it is useless to put a definite term to this until there are more signs than appear at present that the Muscat Government is capable of standing by itself* I have the honour to be.

To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and : olitical Department, DELHI. Sir, I have the honour to report, for the information of the Government of India, that on the ICth March I paid a visit to Muscat in the course of which I paid a farev/ell call on His Highness the Sultan, in the course of v/hich a variety of subjects was discussed. 2. Some time before, the Political Agent had told me that since his return from Dhofar at the end of January liis Highness had frequently enquired when I might be i expected to visit Huscat as he hd a coixsnunication to make to me; he would not however say anything to the Political Agent on the subject. I consequently expected His Highness to say something of a confidential nature, and expected he would &gt; raise the queetion of his abdication again. 5. After a good deal of conversation about his stay in Dhofar and the nature of that province and its inhabitants, His Highness came to his confidential communication. At first he dilated a good deal on the worries and troubles of government, saying that he had no desire to rule etc., and I thought he would definitely put forward the idea of abdicating, so I said that I hoped he would continue to bear the burden and carry on the government until his son became old enough to take over the reins. His Highness said that he would, and 1 i 1 »/ ^ No. 38-T. E,I.M*S. 'LAV-i:2103y At Sea, 16th March 1924#I then gathered that what he wanted to say was not so much the question of abdicating as of obtaining Governments recognition of his son as his successor. I reminded Ris Highness that this question had already 'been laid before Government who*had decided that they could not officially recognise his son as successor. I adaed that in such cases my ovm practice was to recognize informally as heiu the son or other relative recognized by the actual ruler as his heir, and I thought Government took the same line unless the char- -acter or behaviour of the heir was such as to prevent their doing so: I felt sure that Government granted'the same amount of informal recognition of his son Sayyid Saeed as they had done in his own case when his father the late Sultan Faisal considered him the heir. His Highness seemed perfectly satisfied with this. 4., His Highness then went on to say that he could find no suitable person in the State to advise him in reforming the Administration, and keeping the finances straight, when he was present at Muscat, and when he was not present to galvanize the Council of Ministers into life. His Highness said that the members of the Council, though very worthy persons, were absolutely useless as administrators, apart from which they would never come to a decision about any matter, even unimportant questions, and persisted in leaving eveiything over to await his return. In this I cordially agree, though, of course, I did not say so. His Highness said that he Y /anted to get an Znglishman who would advise him when in in Muscat and during his absence 'run 1 ' the Council of Ministers. Would Government give him a man ? I said I thought it might excise unfavourable comment if Government actually appointed an officer as Wazir or ±inance member of the Council which was what I thought he required. I thought it better that I, or rather my successor, should makemake enquiries and see if a suitable man could be found. If so he could visit His Highness at Dehra Bun (where he intends to go at the beginning of May for about five months), and His Highness could see if he liked the applicant and if his temperament and conduct seemed suitable; if so Hie Highness could bring him back ^hen he returned in October under contract as Financial Adviser with the prospect of becoming Minister of Finance if he proved suitable and worked satisfactorily. After some discussion His Highness said that ; if a suitable man presented himself^he could engage him as Secretary in India and see how he shaped, whether his manners and treatment of Orientals seemed likely to satisfy Arabs etc; if so he would bring the man up. I said that I thought'that to attract a suitable man it-would be necessary to offer at least 1500/- but more probably Hs 2000/- per mensem with house and travelling allowance etc., and added that this would be a severe strain on the finances of the Muscat State. His Highness agreed and aaid that if only he coitld secure a suitable man he would gladly pay half his pay up to 1000/- a month from the privy purse. I said this wa^aTgenerous offer and I thought that the State Treasury could easily bes,r the other half. 'While on the subject of the State Finances and the existing stringency, His Highness stated that he would be^ glad to refund half his monthly allowances to the State during his stay in India, and live there on 2s 5000/-. I said this was a very generous offer on His Highness* part and would go far to rehabilitat- -ing the State finances. His Highness then said that on his voyage up from India about a year ago he had met an off- -icer who had seemed to him to be a very suitable x^son. * He was then or had recently been employed in the Iraq Customs Department, he could not remember the officer's name but believed he had his visiting card' somewhere if he could find it. I said that if he could gind and send me the visit- -ing card4 card or the officer's name I would endeavour to trace him and ascertain if he was suitable and qualified to undertake the job, and willing to take service with the Muscat State; and let His Highness know the result. ^ We then had some conversation as to what the position of the English Member of the Council would be vis.a-vis His Highness 1 brother Saiyid Nadir; I v/as inclined to think it would be very difficult but His Highness thought he could easily arrange matters so that their relations v/ould be on a satisfactory footing. His Highness said that Saiyid Hadir's sole idea was to avoid responsibility and put everything off till the Sultan's return, he thought that if Saiyid Hadir found he had a colleague who would take responsibility and do things he would be only too glad to leave matters in his hands. b- I think the Sultan's proposal, in the forn it emerged irom this conversation, to try and find a suitable Englishman who would take service with him and run the JState finances is a ^ood one. His Highness harped a good deal on his desire only to do what was right in the eyes of the British Government, and said he particularly wished to avoid , / getting an Englishman who would not work cordially with the / Political Agent; he wanted a man who would be goided by the / _ | Political Agent's advice when necessary ; and who would guide his policy on lines agreeable to the British Government. j r Hhould a suitable man be found and engaged as Finance Member of the Council,- it will of course be unnecess- ~ary for the Commandant of the Levy Corps to be financial Adviser. It seems possible that uaptain Alban, the present commandant, will shortly be given another appointment. If so / 1 think that his successor might be simply Commandant of the Levy Corps and his staff pay reduce^ to say Ss 400/- per mensem. If His Highness sends me the card of the officer hehe met last year I will endeavour to trace him; if not 1 propose to make enquiries with a view to finding a suitable man. If one is found I will instxnct him to visit the Sultan at Behra Dun. If the Sultan approves of him it would be easy for His Highness in consultation with the Political Agent, who could if necessary visit His PUghness while on recess, to make a suitable contract# I have the honour to be, v J.

Thomas, O.3.E., who is at the present moment in the employ of the Palestinian Administration, but wrote to me recently that he had not made up his mind to stay, i have telegraphed to him to see me at Jerusalem ne: xt weeK on my way'home, and I will discuss the question km and telegraph you the result. He would undoubtedly be the ideal man. He has an exceptionally good and fluent know ledge of Arabic and can read it easily and write it xairly well The present financial Adviser in Mesopotamia Slater) made repeated efforts to secure his services for the revenue settlement of Mesopotamia; as, of the yormger generation of Ilesopotamia. no one can compare with him for knowledge of revenue business. He has no Customs exper ience but this can be easily picked up. He is a good traveiler, a man of great energy, very popular amongst irabs has got on very well with the Smir Abdullah and, believe impressed Iling Eussain very favourably on his recent visit to Amman. His integrity is beyond^question, his constitution has stood 8 years in Mesopotamia end Palestine with only one spell of leave. He has a charming ~ ^ ■? nmRiftian and a Rood norse- man. Should ne accept, xt wuuxu. ^ to the Colonial Office asking for his 5 ervioes ' understood unofficially that he would te prepared to 6°°^ the post if offered, subject to terms, &amp;o. to he .ixed later. Should you think it necessary and desirable for him to be interviewed by the Sultan, he would no doubt be willing to go to Behra Bun for the purpose, presuming that his travelling expenses both ways would be paid in any Oo.se i am however, miite confident that the Sultan would very readily accept him. He is the best of all possible candid- ates.V 3 ^ - ( 2 ) (G01ITINUED If he does not accept, I think your best course would be to ask the High Commissioner to recommend some one from Uesopotamia. There are several men with good finance and revenue experience who are, I understand, likely to leave the Mesopotamian Service shortly - notably X. M. Yetts, O.E.E., and S. E. Hitchcock, both good men with considerable experience. Other possible candidates would be E. I. Iloyd, Major H. 0. Pulley. O.B.E., I.A., and R. E. Audoman, C.I.E., O.E.E., all of them men with more experience and better qualifications than men like M. J. Murray, M.O., to whom I presume your letter refers. Yours sincerely, L A' i Colonel IP J?

I presume that as the view of the Govern- ment of India as expressed In the above-quoted memorandum Is labelled provisional It Is liable to modification and therefore I propose to reiterate my previous views that falling the Government of India refusing entirely to entertain the ideas of remitting the repayment of the loan for five years or increas ing the Sultan's subsidy the only real remedy for Muscat f s financial ills is to arrange for an Increase in the C&amp;stoms Duty. The other economic proposals are really merely palliatives and do not stride at the heart of the problem. S. g. p. i.—247 p. A. &amp; h. b. m. Consul Muscat— 6*12-11 500»' ^ ^' fi, 3, I will take the paragraphs as they stanl in the memoraniunu (a) Excise licences have not yeu been carried into effect. It appears that all that would he requirel in the case of Muscat subjects woull be a proclam ation by the Sultan but this would be useless if British subjects were not compelled to take out similar licencesat the same time and a King's Regulation would be required for this. Colonel Trevor promised to look up the machinery for the issue of a King f s Regulation and the scheme was postponed pending a communication from Bushire, ; The commodities proposed to be included under Excise licences were wines and spirits ^Rs 500 p.a.) and opium and preparations of hemp (Rs 100 p.a.) and I estimated the total financial effect at about Rs 1500 annually. The Municipal house tax was to have been carried into effect in Matrah by Captain Alban and as far as Arab subjects were concerned was, I believe, startel but some doubt arose as to whether or no a King's Regulation would be necessary here also as most of the revenue would come from British subjects* Captain Alban was very ill for the last four months he was a^ Muscat and I fear the matter slipped my memory. In any case the revenue from both the above taxes would be extremely small and would hardly affect Muscat's financial position. The camel tax was brought into operation but after a spirited protest from the Omanis Colonel Trevor while at Muscat ordered me verbally to advise the Muscat Government to drop it as it might lead to a renewal of the illfeeling between Muscat and the Omanis. This was done from April 1st and it was a matter of considerable kaxia« regret to me as it was then bringing in about Rs 4U0 a month and would haveLSOH, produced considerably more in the date harvest sea (b) aith regard to the proposed increase in Customs duty 'lay I point out that the 5% rate was fixed in 1891 33 years ago and I think I am right in asserting that **« every country which has a system of tariffs (and India itself is ho exception ) has increased its rates within that period. It is not / therefore, an unfair request to maKe to the other countries concerned, and short of perennial aii financial aid which is undesirable from many points of view. is. to my mind the only possible way of balancing the Muscat Budget. It should be remember ed that the customs are the only way the Omanis can be compelled to contribute to the Muscat Government revenues and that they form the main source of revenue of the Stafe The only other tax which is collected is the date harvest ^ax (zakat) and that is open to so many abuses it does not produce the revenue it should do. A reorganisation of it was begun by Captain Alban but it entails a detail ed survey of all the date groves and cannot be complete for some time. I think it should be borne in mind that the raising of the customs dues would not materially affect France or America as the import trade from the one is nil and from the other so small and so indirect as to be practically negligible (c) Rgma3lO-il _of repayment o f the loan fnr fiv. i suggested this as I considered it would give us set time to search about for other sources of revenue. The discovery of oil was what I had in mind at the time. The remission will come automatically^,I presume, if mattes go on as they are at present. (d) Reduction of the Sultan's Priw P- ; r- go It appears that Colonel Trevor and I misunderstood the Sultan's attitude on the subject of halving his privy purse. As ho has explained to me since what he meant was thatf, if while he was away from Muscat, the Treasury became empty he was willing to let half his salary lapse in ordtr temporarily to stave off a financial crisis.He denies that he ever intended to surrender volountarily and peraianently XMffla Rs500() a month. He says he could not in any case offer to submit to a lesser income wnile at Unseat as there he is subject to heavy calls on his purse from the many descendants a la main gauche' of his forebears and from outlying chiefs who demand his hospitality. In any case I ivould not recommend any reduction in his purse as it would qui^e possibly lead to an immediate renewal of his previous ^ idea ol abdication and it is to be remembered that he is after all an independent ruling sovereign and as such can is* hardly be expected to keep up his position on anything much smaller than his present income. ( e ) Reductio n of the ■Ai Rrtn f. The strength of this force was originally fixed at 300^ quo owing to financial stringency it nas already been reduced to a trifle over 200 and I have further ordered the new Commandant lot to enlist any more until it is down to the latter figure which is in my opinion the lowest possible compatible with safety. The Sultans authority is to my mind largely dependent on the existence of a suitable striking fore^, in the vicinity of Muscat and if it should be possible to station detachments of this force at or near the other coast towns under adequate administration to support the authority of the local Walis I think we should A a considerable improve ment in government and most probably an increase in revenue, ^e should seek therefore rather to augment the State Forces in order to ensure that loqal authorities* hands are strong enough to cope with incipient disorder (this applies partic ularly to Sur) and that the Central G-overnment be in a position to insist on satisfactory administration in the outlying towns. May I correct the misapprehension of its being an alien force? True, it is largely composed of Baluchis but these are Muscat Baluchis, descendants of previous immigrants from the opposite coast and subjects of His Highness. There are some Baluch from Grwadur district, which incidentally is also an appanage ofl Muscat, and a fe?/ Yemenis from near Aden but otherwise it is in all senses a national and not an alien force.(f) Increase in the Sultan 1 a subsidy ^suggested uhis more as a means of driving home ^ the seriousness of the financial situation at Muscat than anything else. I am not in favour of anything ti in the shape of doles whenever they can be avoided. It would be preferable to see Muscat stand firmly on its own feet rather than existing on the bounty of a foreign government. (g) Lr Bower 1 s deoutation Colonel Trevor suggested this as kr Bower had made such an improvement in the Bahrein customs but matters are rather different in Muscat. I do not thmt the Dtate is losing much on the central customs which are under the control of an able Egyptian but probably there is a certain amount of loss on the outlying ones, the control and inspection of which depend more on political factors and adequate and rapid means of transport rather than on system and organisation. 4. To sum up the points of the above-quoted memorandum: paragraph (a) is partly nearly negligible in effect and partly found impracticable, (d) is undesirable and (e) inadvisable; (g) seems unnecessary and the G-overnment of India do not wish to accede to (b), (c) or (f) except as last resources, (h) is agredct on but its financial effect will not be immediately « apparent. 5, In the circumstances the estimate of the immediate future financial situation remains as previoias- ly described by my predecessor and myself, that is oo say we may look to a crisis occurring before very long. I find that in 1922 the State lost li lakhs of rupees, in 1923 1 lakh and this year the deficit can hardly be less than -J- of a lakh. This will by the end of the year leave Muscat without any balance in hand and as the current revenue is not sufficient for the expend iture which under the present administration cannot , I believe, be reasonably reduced there can be only oneresult, namely, bankruptcy. This year we ought just to weather helped by the present high rate of the dollar and the prospects of a fair date crop. I have also hopes that the appointment of the new European Finance Minister may alter the situation materially but as I pointed out above I do not think he can be @^9 expected to improve the position much in the immediate future.

H, rince my arrival in April laa t I have had no opportunity of visiting Muscat or of consulting the Polit- •ical Agent at length on the (Jifficult question of the State finances. 5. As far as I am able to Judge from a perusal of the records the vie^ of the situation taken by Major Hinde in his letter is a reasonable though admittedly unfavour- -able one. It is evident that unless means tire found to increase the revenues the Muscat State will be insolvent in a very short time. 4, of the proposals. both for reduction of expend- •iture and increase of revenue, hitherto submitted to the I I Government of India and provisionally accepted by them in your memorandum under reference, the attempted increase in Excise(£5 Bxeise licensee t Municipal and Camel Ta&amp;es has produced an almost insignlfleant result; the reduction of the 'ultan's privy purse ha® proved iasprac tioable- the proposal having 'been made under a mlsapprehenBion; the reduction of the Muscat Levy Corps below a strength of 200 appears inadvis- -able owing to the Sultan's entire dependence on it for authority of any sort outside the local limits of Muscat town, and finally Mr. Bower's deputation or the appoint- -ment of a British Officer as finance Member of the Muscat Council can hardly be expected to produce any iiamediate result in the required direction. 5. It is very unfortunate that circumstances beyond our control have prevented us till now from finding a suitable Financial Adviser for the State. 6. We would have been delighted to have Mr. Bower last January, but he could not postpone his leave to Kngland. he Sultan asked in March for a Mr. Murray of Iraq; we were told in April that this officer was medically unfit. We were then offered by Bir H. Bobbs a Mr. i^onk.

He is now in India where he will see the Sultan and Major Hinde. He was formerly a District Bevenue Officer in Iraq and has a very good reputation as an all round capable man.
