Mr* Gardener opens this discussion with an interesting appreciation of the tribal situation in Fars (pages 2-5- A brief description of the tribes concerned is given in an Appendix, pages 5 and 6). He gives reasons for the present resurgence of the tribes, which together with their deep-seated distrust of the Persian Government, has produced the present deadlock t and examines the motives behind liasir Khan* s present conciliatory at'fefctude towards the British. He suggests that the chief aims of British policy should be the protection of British interests, and the re-establishment of the power of the Central Government, and discusses the best methods of achieving these aims. H.M.Ambassador, in his covering despatch, lays particular emphasis on the essential disunity of the tribes and the need for caution in relation to Nasir Khan’s present promises. He agrees with L!r.Gault that the essentials if there is to be peace in Fars are:- that the question of the tribal land should be settled; that effective arrangements should be made for tlie distribution to the tribes of essential consumer goods;(3) that long term plans should be made for the eventual settlement of the tribes; (4) that sene sort of special tribal administration should be created in which the real tribal leaders should be represented. Sir Reader Bullard points out that while at the mcment our policy must be directed towards the re-establishment of the power of the Central G-overnnent, it should not be forgotten that that G-overment may not always be friendly towards us. The Foreign Office in their reply, however, maintain that that is a risk which must be taken and that British policy in Persia must be aimed at increasing the authority of the Persian G-ovemment.

I approve the policy outlined in paragraph 2 of your despatch for the improvement of the tribal situation in Persia generally. 3. With regard to the considerations in paragraph 3 of your despatch, there can, of course, be no doubt that the re-establishment of the power of the central Government carries with it the risk that the Government may prove intractable. But the alternative, namely a weak central Government which is easily amenable to outsidi, influence and would continue indefinitely to permit direct intervention by foreign Powers in tribal or other internal affairs, is most unlikely in the long run to serve our interests. - I therefore agree that, while for the present W3i must seek to safeguard our immediate interests by means of intervention, the re-establishment of the central Government’s authority must ultimately take precedence. 4.

Bullard to Mr. Eden .—( Tehran, 10th June, 1944. ’ I HAVE the honour to enclose a copy of an interesting appreciation of the tribal situation in Ears, prepared by Mr. Gardener just before he left Shiraz to proceed on leave. I agree generally with Mr. Gardener s appreciation and teel that particular emphasis should be laid on the following two points, both of which were mentioned by him :— (1) That, although the Qashgai tribes may rally behind Nasir in the face of a common danger, the kalantars of the main tribes have no desire to be exploited again by the Soulat ed Douleh family and, gi\en a reasonable hope of fair treatment, they will very easily be persuaded to deal direct with the Government. Our experience in Bakhtiari with Morteza Quli Khan, a much more reliable man than Nasir, shows us what happens nowadays w T hen a tribal chief is put into a position of paramount authority in a big tribal confederation. Similar dissensions could be expected in Qashgai between Nasir and his brothers and other rivals. (2) That no long-term reliance can be placed on Nasir’s assurances of a desire to act according to our wishes. We should take advantage of it now, hut when British troops are withdrawn Nasir will probably pose as the national hero who saved Ears from a British occupation. 2. For some time I have been endeavouring to induce the Persian Govern ment to evolve and implement a definite policy towards the tribes. Such a policy should include at least the following points :— (a) Settlement of tribal land cases and the restoration of, or the grant of compensation for, lands unjustly confiscated by Reza Shah. Under continual pressure from this embassy some action has been taken, but several cases are still outstanding, notably the important case of the Mamassani lands referred to by Mr. Gardener under the heading “ Methods of Application of British Policy.” {b) The distribution among the tribes (and among other rural communities) of the essential consumer goods—tea, sugar and piece-goods—^which have for a considerable time been available to town-dwellers on coupon at controlled prices. There have been many scandals in this connexion and the distribution is, even now, far from efficient; but until recently rural areas, including the tribes, have had to depend entirely on pur chases on the open market at exorbitant prices. Lately, with the appointment of American advisers at a number of provincial head quarters with instructions from Dr. Millspaugh to expedite the distribution of consumer goods to rural areas, the situation may have improved to some extent. I propose to call for reports from consular officers on this point in order to ascertain whether, in fact, any improvement in distribution is now taking place. (c) Settlement of the tribes. This is a long-term policy, and if the settlement is to be voluntary and not, as in Reza Shah’s time, forced, it must involve long-term plans and a budget of considerable proportions. Reza Shah’s settlement was carried out by military force and resulted in unprecedented mortality among the flocks on which the tribes so largely depend for a livelihood, and a general lowering of the tribes’ already low standard of living. To bring about the voluntary settle ment of tribes in villages, the Government must plan and provide funds for assistance to the tribesmen in building villages, irrigation works, and the provision of seed, as well as medical aid and the erection and staffing of schools. It seems unlikely that the PersianGovernment will be able to afford to implement all these proposals for some time to come, but a beginning might well be made on irrigation works in some areas (financed, if necessary, and where possible, by private companies formed for the purpose), the provision of some seed and perhaps medical aid in the form of the travelling dispensaries | which the American Director of Public Health, Dr. Avery, hopes, with 1 an optimism which is probably fated to be disappointed, to put into ' commission before long to the number of forty-eight. ^ (d) The creation of a body, whether a Ministry for Tribes, a section of the Ministry of Internal Affairs or some form of tribal commission, whose business it would be to study the needs of the tribes, to plan for them and to represent their grievances effectively to the Central Government. Several abortive attempts have been made to set up such a body, but I have better hopes of the latest suggestion—the formation of tribal j councils—-and propose to press M. Hajhir to carry it out. The scheme is to form a central tribal council in Tehran, consisting of representa tives of the Ministries who would be concerned with any long-term tribal policy, i.e., the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance, Justice, Public Health and Education, and about twelve genuine tribal repre sentatives (not town-dwelling ex-chieftains). The recommendations of the council would be executed through provincial tribal councils, which would consist of similar departmental representatives and representatives of the tribes in the provinces concerned, presided over by the Governor-General. 3. As for British policy in respect of Persian tribes (apart from the matters discussed above), I agree with Mr. Gardener that this should be directed, firstly, towards securing our interests both during and after the war, and, secondly, towards the re-establishment of the power of the Central Government on a just and equitable basis. That the first is completely subordinate to the second, as Mr. Gardener suggests, I am not entirely convinced. Mr. Gardener rather implies that a strong Central Government would be friendly to us. Of the contrary state of affairs we have had hitter experience in the recent past, though it can be argued that in keeping the Russians at arm’s length Reza Shah performed a service for us which did much to counterbalance the injustices which he inflicted upon our interests. . 4.

I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Appreciation of the Tribal Situation in Ears. Introduction^ IN recent weeks, the political atmosphere in Ears has been cleared up by certain acts of Nasir Khan, the head of the Qashgai. These are : The surrender to us of the Germans on the 23rd March, Nasir Khan’s visit to Shiraz on the 1st May, when he called on the local Persian and British representatives, and finally his surrender to us on the 3rd May of the mischievous Deputy Naubakht. As Nasir Khan now states that he is ready to accept British guidance in all his actions, it is necessary to determine our policy towards him and all the tribes of Ears. Present Situation. 1. Attitude towards Persian Government. All the tribes (for brief description see Appendix), but particularly the Qashgai who are politically the most important tribe of Ears and who, theiefoie, fio-ure most prominently in this appreciation, are imbued with the deepest dfstrust—amounting practically to hatred—of the Government. This is partly due to the harsh, inefficient, and venal treatment meted out to them by the ex-Shah,and partly to the tribal nature which prizes power and independence. Taking advantage of the weakness of the Government after the events of 1941, certain tribal leaders fled from Tehran and resumed control of the tribes. Gradually the tribes were rearmed by seizing arms from Government sources, by smuggling from abroad, and by digging up weapons not surrendered in the past. Having, through his strong personality and in virtue of the fact that he is the *^son of the last great Ilkhani, consolidated his own position as head of the tribe, Nasir Khan’s next step was the conclusion of a defensive alliance between the Qashgai and the Boir Ahmedi—the two leading fighting tribes of South Persia— to resist disarmament by force. . There seems little doubt but that these two tribes would now act in concert it attacked by the Government, and that other tribes, such as the Mamassani and sections of the Khamseh (notably the Basiri), would refuse to aid the disarming Government forces, and might even take sides against Government. On the Government side, the army has not yet given proof of its abilit\ to tackle these tribes, and judging by past performance the disarmament of the present tribal bloc would be a severe and perhaps critical test of its fighting powers. t Thus, as between tribes and Government there is a deadlock. The Govern ment hesitate to embark on a disarmament campaign, while the tribes have done nothing to provoke Government into action. 2. A ttitude towards British. Owing particularlv to the attitude of the khans of the Darrashuri and Kashguli sections of the Qashgai, the Germans who were harboured by the Qashgai were not able to bring about damage to British interests. On the contrary, when they were in tribal—though admittedly not Qashgai—areas, Nasir initiated his policy of preserving security in Ears. For the last six months, including this spring migration, security in Qashgai areas and on adjoining roads has been relatively good. This state of affairs was not altered (although the wound still smarts), when a severe blow was given to Nasir’s pride by the Persian Government who refused to allow him to become a Deputy for Shiraz. Nor is there any reason, on present showing, to think that British interests are likely to suffer at the hands of the Fars tribes, i.e., not including the Boir Ahmed. Furthermore, Nasir s feelings towards us will undoubtedly have a useful repercussion on the Boir Ahmed, as the paramount chief of that tribe—Abdullah Khan Zarghampur—is a close friend of Nasir’s. This agreeable state of affairs is not due to Nasir’s love and admiration for us, but more probably to the following considerations : (a) knowledge of Allied war successes and desire to be on the ‘ ‘ right side; (b) general desire of the khans (especially Darrashuri and Kashguli) to be on friendly terms with us so that we may act as mediators between them and the Persian Government; (c) gratitude for our return of the Qashgai Khans who were recently in Germany. This argument especially appeals to Nasir’s mother, who exercises a salutary influence over him; and^ finally (d) desire of the Khans to further their own personal interests. Nasir Khan and the.other Qashgai Khans now stress their desire to follow our counsels. Of course, this naive attitude must be heavily discounted, but it is probably true that, for the time being, our advice will carry considerable weight with them. 3. Internal Situation. There is, as yet, very little evidence of the attitude of the other Qashgai Khans towards Nasir save that, at the moment, they are united with him in opposing disarmament. In any case, the present state of affairs rather suits the personaf interest of all the khans. They supervise security on the roads, exacting tribute money in return. They are independent, and pay no taxes. No Govern ment official robs or worries them. In fact, they are leading the old tribal life. But some of them yearn to come and live in towns. Even Nasir and some of his family desire this. Some khans may resent Nasir’s assumption of authority over them. Former inter-tribal feuds are not forgotten. Furthermore, some of the khans desire to return to their former pursuits of agriculture and stock-breeding, from which they derived wealth in the past. The situation may be roughly summarised by stating that the Qashgai in times of war or danger are united under Nasir, but that, being human, they desire peace, and peaceful conditions best serve to disintegrate the tribe. [55—15] B 24 4. Economic Situation. The standard of living in the tribes—'always lower than that in the towns— has suhered markedly in the last two years. In the first place, the nomadic tribes, responding to their khans' call to arms, have largely abandoned their agricultural pursuits (corn growing and stock raising) from which some of them gained their livelihood. Secondly, tribal produce (carpets, gum tragacanth, mutton, and animal fats) has fetched lower prices because the tribesmen have had no direct access to open markets. They are obliged to sell their produce and buy their necessities through grasping intermediaries. Finally, unlike the townsmen, they have not benefited from the rationing of tea, sugar and piece-goods. It is true that the tribes have robbed farms and villages, and have exacted “ protection money ” from those unfortunate people who lie in their path, but this wealth has gone mainly to the khans. As a result the tribesmen feel that they are different from and inferior to the inhabitants of towns, and, in the case of the Qashgai who are of Turkish origin, this feeling may eventually lead to separation. Unfortunately, the tendency is to blame the British for these shortages, since the British always were, and still are. the most prominent foreigners in Ears. Suggested Principles of British Policy. It is obvious that British policy in Ears must be directed towards :— {a) Security of British interests (notably oil-fields) during and after the war. (b) Re-establishment of the power of the Central Government. The first objective is clearly subordinate to the second, for, if a strong Central Government existed which was friendly towards us and able to administer the tribes justly and efficiently, there would be no need for our intervention in tribal matters. But, in the absence of such a Government, our intervention is probably necessary to protect our interests and to bring about a state of affairs favouring the reassumption of control by the Central Government. In intervening, however, we should avoid certain dangers. Firstly, care must be taken that we do not enter into any commitments towards one side or the other which cannot be honoured. Secondly, we should not take such action with the tribes as to cause the Persian Government to consider we have created a privileged position for them and so lead to the Government taking reprisals on them after the war when we shall be less able to protect them. Thirdly we should take care in our dealings with the tribes not to increase their importance so that Government will eventually find it more difficult to subdue them; and finally, care should be exercised not to enhance the standing of any one tribe (like the Qashgai) 01 family (like Nasir Khan); otherwise our difficulties will increase Methods of Application of British Policy. I he first task is obviously to break the present deadlock between the tribes and the Government. The deadlock is brought about basically by disagreement let ween the two parties as to the abolition of the nomadic life. The Government says they should abandon the nomadic life and be sederitarised, while the tribes (iaim they would do this if they were confident that the Government would not molest them. As a way out of the present impasse, His Majesty’s Embassy has now suggested to the Persian Government that a special tribal administration be now formed with the object of ensuring the efficient administration of the tribes. In order to gam the confidence of the tribes, it is suggested that (a) foreign advisers be engaged; and also, apparently (b) the tribes be given some voice in the matter by the formation of a tribal council composed of chiefs. It is presumed that one of the first tasks of this tribal administration will be the settlement of the Mamassani land claims. his genei al plan, if faithfully carried out, should meet with a considerable measure of success. It is probable that a hard core of unsettled tribe may remain due to the ambitions or ignorance of their leaders, but the organised tribal bloc wou d by then have been so weakened that the minimum of forceful persuasion would be necessary It may well be, in the case of the Qashgai, that Nasir Khan will prove a stumbling-block to tribal settlement. But the policy of settling the tribes is a long-term one, and in the meantime theie are other steps of a detailed nature which, if taken, would serve to build up the confidence necessary for the success of the general plan.5 First of all it is suggested that tea, sugar and piece-goods be distributed among the tribes, but that in doing so care should be taken that the Qashgai are not privileged. Secondly, tribes might, as far as possible, be encouraged to revert to agriculture by supplying them, in suitable cases, with seed wheat and barley. Thirdly, through our intervention and interest in them, we could encourage tribesmen to visit towns for trading purposes. Fourthly, we could urge the Government to provide better medical facilities for the tribes. In the main, all ^^e above-mentioned points are for the Persian Government to execute, but, as we are blamed for the present bad economic conditions, so presumably we should be credited for any improvement therein. As far as we ourselves are concerned, it is suggested that the employment of suitable tribal liaison officers (and especially medical officers) should be continued. Besides collecting useful tribal information both of a basic and a ‘ day-to-day nature, suitable officers make valuable contacts in the tribes, cultivate good-will and spread useful propaganda among ignorant people. So far, British officers have not been able, for valid reasons, to extend their activities to the Boir Ahmed tribe. Yet, since this tribe is situated so close to the oil-fields, they are of considerable political importance. It is possible that the present friendli ness of Nasir Khan, the Qashgai ally of the Boir Ahmed, may facilitate our penetration into their relatively unknown area. Similar opportunities may present themselves from the Khuzistan angle. In the local interpretation of our policy it is suggested that special attention be paid to the following points, some of which have been mentioned above :— (a) The importance of the Qashgai, and of Nasir Khan in particular, should not be exaggerated—otherwise other tribes will tend to fall under his influence. (fr) Nasir Khan’s ambitions for increased power, on the ground that he can thereby the better protect his tribe, should be regarded with some suspicion until he has proved his good faith. (c) Every effort should be made to act in concert with the local Persian authorities and thus make them and the tribes believe it is the Persians, and not the British, who are directing policy. Otherwise there is a danger of a recrudescence of anti-British feeling in Persian official circles which might result in reprisals on our alleged tribal proteges. Shiraz, §th May, 1944. Appendix. Brief Description of Tribes of Fars. Qashgai. (Rough population 100,000.) Politically, the Qashgai are the most important tribe in Fars because of their tradition of fighting strength and cohesion. They are comparatively well-armed and are united under the leadership of Nasir Khan, son of the former great Ilkhani, Soulet-ed-Douleh, who died when imprisoned by the ex-Shah. Nasir is an ambitious individual possessing great force of character, and is imbued with old-time ideas of the part to be played by the Qashgai in Fars. He is bitterly opposed to the Persian Government both on account of the former harsh treatment meted out by them, and also because Government acts as a curb on his ambitions. Nasir, in his exile in Tehran, became friends with Abdullah Khan Zarghampur, paramount chief of the Boir Ahmedi (q.v.), and with Husain Quli Rustami of the Mamassani {q.v.). The Qashgai, who are now almost entirely nomadic, have their winter habitat in the region between the oilfields around Gach Seran- in the north and Ear in the south-east. Mamassani. (Rough population 26,000.) This tribe is a sedentarised offshoot of the Boir Ahmed who border them on the north. Their neighbours to the south and east are the Kashguli section of the Qashgai. As their lands are well-watered and fertile, the Mamassani have6 tov Cl Clc-o y rn $ see houses, live stock and crops to lose if they become enemies either of the Government or of the surrounding tribes. They possess a certain quantity of arms and declare their readiness to defend their rights against all comers. Their natural policy is obviously to ally themselves with whichever party oft'ers them better protection. Until the rise to power of the Qashgai, this policy has led them to side with the Government, but since the decay of the latter’s power, the tendency has been for the Mamassani to reach agreement firstly with the Bqir Ahmedi (whom th fear most), and secondly with the Qashgai. The tribe is divided into four sectio each governed by a Kalentar, of whom the most powerful is Husain Quli, who was exiled with Nasir Qashgai and Abdullah of the Boir Amhedi. An important element in the Mamassani politics is the land claims. A certain Bushire merchant obtained rights over their lands some fifty years ago, and is now claiming owner ship of nearly the whole. His claims have, in the past, been supported by the Persian Government, and the present Government appears to be following the ?ob rrufcj same path. In consequence, the Mamassani have additional cause to be estranged C^Ql y^pa-rk vLle-; /xr &gt;b'i7 from the Government. 'hh Khamseh. (Rough population 85,000.) This tribe of mixed Turkish and Arab origins is now partly nomadic and partly sedentarised. It is split up into a number of .sections and has now no prominent local leader. Its traditional head, Qawam ul Mulk, has for many years lived in Tehran, and his present authority over the tribe is open to argument. Thus, although the tribe has some arms, it is of little political importance save that the Basiri section flirt with the Qashgai. Boir Ahmedi. (Rough population 30,000.) Economically it is the most distressed tribe of Ears, partly due to its own fecklessness, and partly owing to the exactions of Government officials. By other tribes it is held up as an example of the evils of submission to Government. The territory of this tribe is not situated in modern Ears, but on account of its alliance with the Qashgai it plays a prominent part in Ears politics. Although of purely Persian origin, it is the most feared tribe of South Persia. Raiders from this tribe range far into settled territory in pursuit of loot, and are good fighters, possessing a considerable stock of modern arms. They have never been properly subdued by the Persian Government, and British contacts with them have, unfortunately, been very limited. The Boir Ahmedi are mainly nomadic, though the range of migration is short as their country comprises both the warm foothills and a portion of the rugged plateau itself. In its winter quarters the tribe is very close to the oil-fields at Gach Seran. . „ , A1 n Traditionally, the tribe is divided into warring factions, but Abdullah Khan Zarghampur, since his return from exile in Tehran, has been able to extend his authority over most of the tribe. This fact, together with the agreement with Nasir Khan Qashgai to unite to resist disarmament, makes these two tribes the most important political factor in South Persia.

These two Brothers have’ Been out of Iran for the last thirteen years. It is stated that they were sent to England for education By their father, Soulat ed Douieh (Sardar Aahair) who sought thus to make good his error in Being actively anti-British during the last war. They first studied agriculture at Reading, and then went to Oxford. Owing to the attiude of reza Shah towards their family, it was difficult for them to return.

Major Jackson states chat a number of ,leading -ashgai met the party there and at other points on the road to welcome them. Since their arrival here, they have received a number of visitors, some inspired By genuine friendship for their family, others By curiosity or By a desire for gain. In general, Shiraz gave them an apparently warm welcome. In company with Major Jackson, they left on 10th April for Firuzabad to see Nasir Khan. .for the British and undertook to exert the maximum effort to prevent any danger to British interests in this country. They further declared their readiness to conform with any instructions we cared to give them on any subject, protesting their desire to Be on the friendliest, possible terms with us, as they saw in us the I only means of promoting the welfare of the ^ashgai. emotional state on returning to their native lund and seeing' their mother (so recently Bereaved) after such a prolonged absence. They know full well that the Allies $ire rapidly winning the war and their wide cocmopoiitan experience makes them realise fully the insignificance of Iran in world politics. In'their attitude towards their tribe they recognise the futility of the present situation, declaring that the days of a nomadic existence • have passed, and that every effort should now Be made to sedentarise ,the tribe. As Khans and sons of the Tlkhani, they admitted they had a special responsibility in this matter, anu expressed their intention of identifying themselves with their tribe, but with the idea of leading it to a Better state of economic existence. of any politigal aspirations for themselves or their tribe, neither did they display any tendency towards Pan-Turanianism or separatism Based on their Turkish origin, except possibly in one remafk (relating to the issue of tea sugar, and cloth to towns and not to tribes), to the effect that they wanted the tribesmen to feel as much part of Persia as the 'dwellers .in towns and to $hed their present idea of inferiority. In their attitude towards the Persian Government they were not particularly fitter (except when speaking of r.eza £&gt;hah), but they did express distrust of the Government - a distrust based on Governmental weakness ana venality. Although their arrival was unannounced as far as I was When they called on me, they stressed their friendship Undoubtedly, ott the moment, they are in a highly Throughout their conversation, I could detect no trace Making/ The Chancary, British Embassy Tehran,Making due allowance for their einotionanux or the enthusiasm horn of their desire to ^^ing about a reform in + r*i'hlife I feel that at the moment these two men c an to ita Sority of Brltl.1. including possibly among the Boir A hmed where, 1 am iniormea, Malik Mansur enjoys a considerable popularity having pe cart of his Infancy there, i’rom the point oi view « the Persian Government, they can also De of use Provided tha Government does envisage a reasonably just plan ior sedentfirisation of the .ashgai. If, however the Persian Government contemplate disarming the tribes h^.^he use ol force alone, the pi'esence of there two Khans will add to the fightino- strength of the '..ashgai, for I feel ^ e ^ on J_ lbly sure they would,' in such an event, feel the call of blood an&lt; espouse the cause of their tribe against ^he government. Taking advantage of their present malleable state of mind I pointed out to them the need to normalise as rapidly as p o ss ible P relations between the Qashgai ana the Government. . Po achieve this end, I added, robbery and acts oi violence committed by the tribe against crops and villages must cease. Such acts served only to antagonise the -people ofjiarsw.s reaction would tend to force the Govt, into ta^cin^ mill a y action°agaInst the tribe. Furthermore I said such acts would reduce the'amount of gram available to ieed tne population of Iran - an important consideration both foi - Persian and Allied Governments. also said that Kasir Khan might consider making's short visit to Shiraz and callin 0 bn the Persian authorities. tmk would discredit the present idea that he is a semi-rebel, obliged to sit on a bare mountain-side, advisea only by unworthy and ignorant people. * Expressing complete agreement with ohese ideas (as does also General J^hanbani whom I had previously consulted, •and who promised Nasir’s immunity f^om arrest or assassination should the question arise), the two Khans leit lor 1iruzaba with Major Jackson on 10th April. .Vben they return in a d vs’ time I fto : e to get some idea of their reception in the camp. They will I fear meet yath opposition ii-om various ^ people of’Nasi-.’s entourage Who are interested had blood between the tribe and the Govt, borne of onese reo le urge Nasir 10 take-a certain line oi action and then receive money to implement the plan. Others are interested in buying ^ashvai products (wool, gum tragacanth, carpets ana animal fatf and selling necessities in return. SiTice these people make profit of 500 - lOOQfc, they view with disapproval any steps whereby the *ashgai would get airecu access to - markets. In parenthesis, I might add that d Jiussain -han is thinking of setting up a sort of (^ashgai co operaoive - society t ) eliminate the middleman. t * They also expressed enthusiastic agi’eemenu , i^h uhe proposal for settling the jashgai of which they had heard Irom the rlmbassv. I warned them that- the proposal was still under consideration and that in any case it was fo» -he Iranian -ov . an'd not for us to implement the scheme. Another/Another element, though it may take some time to develop, is the possible jealousy ol‘ Nasir Khan* l‘or his two brothers, especially the eluer, Malik Mansur Khan. This Khan is in my tentative opinion, the stronger character of the two. i or a short time in 1929 he was appointed Ilkhani and appears to have gained a certain popularity in the tribe. It may well • oe that ITasir,iearing that his brother with his reforming ideas may prove a danger to his dominion over the tribe will seek some cause of dispute and expel him from the tribe. Meanwhile, the reaction to their return of Ali Khan, dai dar nismat TTasir Khan ! s step-uncle and determined opponent, v/ilx be of interest and I will report any information on this point that T air able to obtain. Another- point of interest is how and where these two brothers propose to live in future. At the present time, there is some talk that the elder brother, Malik Mansur will live in j. eh ran as the agent of the v^ashgai with the Persian Government, v/hile M d hussain will replace in Shiraz, iOiosrow, who will return to his tribe and exercise his functions of Governor of Firuzabad. The departure of Khosrow for his tribe would be viewed with great concern by Madame Jehanbani, who might well use her influence to thwart this plan. On the other hand, on present information, it would be preierable for hasir himself to go to Tehran leaving the unofficial leadership of the tribe to Malik Mansur. It is ° however, early days to discuss such matters. v The essential point now is the attitude of the Persian Government towards the gashgai, and the plans decided on for dealing wi Gjx trie px-esent deadlock. If the Persian Government aoprove a policy of settling this tribe which embodies the use of foreigners as guarantees of good faith, I feel certain that the two newfy a.i i ived Khans can be oi great use. If on the other hand, the Government is determined to use force and force alone, the arx-ival tw o brothers strengthens the hand of the dashgai considerably. Yours ever, / (Signed) A.J.

Major Jackson, Area Liaison Officer Shiraz, comments on Captain Garrod's memorandum as follows:- ’'Paragraph 2. Nasir r is regarded with fear rather than 'adoration'. His younger brother Khosrow is adored, Nasir is feared and respected. Paragraph 4(v). True. The Kashkuli and Darashuri Khans constantly pressed Nasir to surrender the Germans, who were trying to incite them to activity against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Paragraph 4(vi) Nasir's 'pact' covered the Boir Ahmadi, Mamassani and some Khamseh as well (Nafar and Baharlu), not to mention Dashti, Dashtistan and Tangistan and Buchakchi (Afshar). Paragraph 4(viii) Last sentence.: does this include the huge sums he — J'- e^ac'ted from’settled people?' t / / 3./ Baxter. Esq., C.M.G., M.C., THE FOREIGN OFFICEJOE 3.

He is surrounded always by a large following composed of the principal Amaleh ilrians, relatives, personal servants and escorts, guests, etc. He is courteous and generous to his following, lavishes expensive presents on his guests, and apx^ears to be extremely popular in all the parts we visited, e.gl Firuzabad, Qir-o-Karzin, Afsar. He is regarded with adoration by his servants and following. His camp is divided into (i) a mobile section which is always reaay to move with him and is pitehed_.and struck with an extraordinary rapidity* Mounted on hefty fast—trotting mules it can cover an easy thirty miles a day*. ..And (ii) .a large semi static section where his family and about 80 families;.of the Anaaleh reside and where he spends the greater part of his time. This is pitched in Winter on the West bank of the Hand .river im - mediately South of the ICarzin plain and centres round a vast black rectangular-reception tent, open in front and screened at the back and sides and, carpeted and. hung v/ith the finest product ions of the Qashgai looms. Immediately in fropt of this is his personal tent, presented to him last year by the Anglo—Iranian Oil Company, and at intervals of about fjO yards are a number of modern commodious tents for his family and guests. At e. greater .distance, -in a crescent, are The black tents.of the Amaleh and the bell-terits of the Amaleh Khans.

Ke is extremely devoted to histwo sons, more especially to Kamiz Khan the younger, whose illness was a matter of acute worry to him during the early part of my visit. He is planning to send Abdullah, the elder, to America for education in the near future and later, he- hopes', to Oxford or Cambridge. But he is bitterly disappointed to seO the results of European education in Persians and Bakhtiari Khans whom he has met in Tehran. He reads and understands a fair amount of English but is shy to speak it on early acquaintance. 4» His. conversation discloses his keen sense of humour and realistic attitude towards his country 1 s affairs and thbse of the outside world.- His knowledge of Persian history is very detailed especially that of Pars, and. he has read much of Sir Percy Sykes* writing on the subject. He has also a detailed knowledge of Kurdestan, Bakhtiari and other parts and is well-acquadbt'ed with the names of the sub-tribes, chiefs and happenings in these parts. , The follov/ing are the principal points which he stressed duripg the many talks I had with him. * : (i). He has decided to do everything in his power to*win -our friend ship and help, because he feels that the future of South Persia rests largely in our hands, and* he is working for the ultimate good of Persia. He and other patriotic Persians are happy now that they feel assured that we have no territorial demands on Persia and that v/e intendlto withdraw our troops on cessation of hostilities. However, they realise that .they will be increasingly dependent upon us for help and economic assistance if their country is to survive. 4 , ^ ^ ^ ^ -a 'C ■ jrVtf • -i. w C. a i ^ NOTE. In this connexion it was evident that everything possible was being done by Nasir Khan to demonstrate in-front of his followers and:other guests his appreciation of our'presence -in his camp, and it is evident that-careful instructions had been given to all his following to reinforce upon us by their own behaviour this impression. &lt;Ii) An oft-repeated intense-hatred and fear of the-Russians , and a conviction that they will not depart, or depart for long, from Persia after the war and that they v/ill seek a territorial^butlet into the Persian Gulf or Indian Ocean. p •• -If ■ ?qswoa t C\^gu6c.ow 3 ay$ he is more frightened of the studied good behaviOu 3 ?° 6 f the Kussiaos in their zoneothan if-they-had'behaved as'i-h the last war. 0 aj urts arc contihually reaching-him of-the-good economic conditions in the Aussian zone* also of a move.-;ent of population into it/from.other parts, and anticipates that-with Russian connivance the North Persians will demand incorporation' into Russia after the Var. Meanwhile anti—British ^propaganda,.; which he admits is largely based on lies and which “he'says is’ greatly worrying him, continues to thrive in South Persia where L conditions are being contrasted with those in the North. E. g. Persian officials tell him tdiat there is no tea, sugar and cloth for t^as hgai because the British have ordered that it should not be given to them. ^ .A ™ r i/ r - f rsa He has studied Rusaxa'n methods used in dealing with the Turkoman tribes and says that Qashgai will fight a off if necessary perish - rather than submit to Russian rule. «r. rgp t m' * - r c » Wl . . t- x -- - w w t- w W !-•••&gt;' ' , (iii) Thinks that v/e are behind most-decisions of the Persian Government* Why do we support- such unpatriotic self-seeking robbers as Soheily. and .his cabinet? -We-put people in posts only because they are good with us and regardless of whether they have the good of the people at heart, or are honest orpatriotic. Afhy did the Shah telegraph that he, who is popular with the people should not he elected i*or Shiraz? Is this demo cratic Government? How can he recognise such a corrupt and rotten Government which has brought South Persia to the lowest and most miserable level it has ever seen? And much more in this strain. (iv) .Thy have we not exerted our influence to-ensure a fair distribution of tea, sugar and cloth to the tribes? Their lack is causing great misery and the people are being told it is our fault. He implores that we should help in this matter, or the conditions of the people will become even worse. /- I (v) Nothing unpleasant was said against the Germans whom he. regards as a warrior race devoid of political skill or understanding. He thinks that after the war we shall split Germany into a number of small independent states. He stated that the Kalantars of Nashkuli and Darrashuri v/rote him many frank and bitter letters urging him to get rid of the Germans v/ho were with him, and said that their presence in his camp became very unpopular with his followers. Two years ago lie would have liked us to make peace with Germany and direct our energies against Russia. 'Sven now he felt that we should leave Russia to exhaust herself against Germany and prolong operations by withholding aid from Russia. (vi) The tribes of South Persia are determined to stand together against any threat of Government oppression. They have learned the lessons ol the past, and have seen how one tribe was incited against another, in turn,'until they were all subjected end ruined. Hence his pact with Abdullah Zarghampur that they will stand and fight together to the bitter end and if necessary all South Persia from Kerman to KTiuzistan .will be laid waste. They will take their children and women to the tops of the mountains. (This in an initial, and the only, outburst on receiving news that Government were starting operations against Bahmai). ( v iiV oince he has been living with the tribes he has become very close to them and regards them as his sons, daughters etc. Their^ present nomadic life is a purely temporary phase, and his ambition is to settle them all when he can do so under conditions of his own making, but' k would not dream of starting this under the present Government who ere only anxious to rob, ruin and destroy them, reducing them to the subhuman level of non-tribal Persia, which will soon be dead and impotent if the present state of Government continues. He has made plans for buildirtg a modern hygienic town on a gentle well-watered slope near ^ir which he hopes one day to populate with Qdshgai. He showed me the site and discussed his plans. (viii) He realises the almost insuperable difficulties in trying to improve conditions in Persian villages and says that this cannot be done in less than a generation. It must start from the bottom, through the medium of schools, doctors and hygienic measures which will have to be rigidly enforced (he is very well-informed and up-to- date in these and in medical matters). He says he has plans for all these things, but cannot undertake anything big in his area until he knows what the future will bring. Moreover, such problems can only be tackled properly by the Government and require a mobilisation of all Persian resources. Says he spent 90'&gt; of his last year’s income an his villagers and tribes. (ix) Belives that he could improve conditions in Pars if the Government would recognise him and grant him the necessary powers. NOTd: All this very vague, and presumably hinting that he should be given a high position. (x) Is extremely worried by drought in South Persia and says he may not be able to keep law and order if the people are starving, is going to supply wheat for his own buluks and those under his'control but if the Government want him to sell them more wheat, they must ’V transport it to these areas, which will come to the same thing. 5 . I was a listener most of the time, hut^did much to reassure him and persuade him that the British oaficials, many of whom I knew, were very anxious to help in economic matters and nursed no grudges or bitterness against the tribes, rather the reverse. Throughout my stay he became increasingly friendly and concluded by giving me a letter, couched in endearing;^ terms., to all Kalantars and Chiefs of . *.ashgai to do everything in their power to assist me in treating the tribes, wherever I might wish to go. In conclusion, I must admit that he is the most powerful one of the most likeable personalities I have met in the course of my wanderings in Persia, and it is my opinion, th' Q t regardless of his personal ambitions he genuinely has the interest of'Persia and his own .people at heart.

IvlAGAN OF THE MILITARY SECURITY D:PT . TEHRAN. NASIR KHAN has the strongest personality of any Persian I have met oth^r then the notorious General ZAHIDI. He is a “big, hard man, standing nearly six feet, and weighing upwards of 14 stone, and about 40 years of age. He is nervous in manner, obviously highly strung, perhaps even hysterical, but in his meeting with us he was open and direct and there was nothing obsequious about him. After the usual compliments, and a minimum of introductory small talk, we got down to hard business. The whole lay-out of the camp was simple and without ostentation, and we were seated on rough tribal rugs on the floor of a small tent one side of which was raised to form a sort of marquee, and through which we had a charming view of the Qashgai camp under the white trunks of a grove of poplar trees, with the wide plain and high ( mountains in the background. For six solid hours we battled with Nasir Khan, vith a break of not more than a quarter of an hour for lunch. Nasir Kahn probably believed he was fighting a preliminary round for high stakes and was bent on wasting as little time as possible on the traditional courtesies.. It was hard for us to frame our tactics as the meeting went on, as Major Jackson and I had very little opportunity to talk together alone. However, we had set ourselves one firm objective before starting, which was to get written instructions from Nasir Khan for the handing over of the Germans. During the course of the conversation we introduced the subject of Naubakht and Kassakowski, but it was obvious that we could only concludeconclude one point in one day, so the discussions about Naubakht and Kassakowski never reached important proportions*ME '• yJ. ■„ ' * , COPY BRITISH CONSULATE SHIRAZ. March 10th, 1944. 374/2/44 Daar Chancery, 1. I enclose herewith in duplicate a Minute by Jackson recording the political topics raised by Nasir Khan Qashgai during Jackson*s visit to Nasir at P’iruzabad on 8th instant. £. On his visit, Jackson was accompanied by Magan, and the former states that in his various interviews with Nasir Khan he has never seen the Khan so excited as he was during the present one. (see para.3 of Minute). Normally he is much more posed and phlegmatic. Both of these officers express their respect for Nasir’s Intellectual qualities - allowance being made for his isolation and background. I am unable to express any opinion on this point. 3. From their reports and from other sources of informa tion it is evident that Nasir is now in a dangerously exalted frame of mind. As Nasir sees it, his writ runs throughout the tribes of Pars (see Minute, para.2 (d)). Nor in his estimation is It confined to the tribes; for he informed Jackson that, if the elections were really free, and the boxes untampered with, he would be found to head the poll with a total of 18,000 votes. Owing to his Isolation from restraining and salutary Influences, there would seem to be no doubt that this appearance of power has gone to Nasir f s head, and were It a question of the Iranian Government only, I personally have no doubt but that Government influence in Pars would soon be challenged. 4. The deciding factor in my opinion is the attitude of His Majesty's Government. As Nasir, and probably still more so as the other Khans, see It, the Allies (which here still means j mainly the British) are winning the war. The Khans understand that we do not want unrest and disturbances and fear that we should either suppress them ourselves, or goad the Iranian Government Into action, lending the Iranian army the necessary material aid. 1 5. The foregoing gives the one determining reason for thinking that the Qashgai will not, without provocation, deliberately and seriously challenge the power of the Iranian Government. Subsidiary reasons are to be found In the nature of the series of tribal alliances of which Nasir is apparently so proud. All of them are, I believe, founded on well merited distrust of the Government and are defensive in character rather than offensive. In any case, I cannot believe that these alliances are formal and binding. Some of the alliances have their origins in fear of Naslr's power of retaliation rather than in common interest (save defensive) or blood ties. First of all there are three racial groups of tribes, Lurs (Persians) represented by the B.A. and Mamassani; Turks, represented by the Qashgai (including partly the Kashgulis and Darashuris and sections of the Khamseh); and Arabs, represented by other sections of the Khamseh. All these peoples have old scores to settle with one another, and are diversified still further by the degree of sedentarlsation they have attained; some, like the Mamassani, being mainly sedentary, and others like the SJashgai, mainly nomadic. Even the Individual tribes, especially the Qashgai - the nucleus of the group - are divided or susceptible of division. Take the Qashgai, composed of Qashgai proper, Kashguli and Darashuri. The Kashguli are probably the most /highly . .... i \ Chancery, British Embassy Tehran* \highly cultured of the nomads. They have a grievance against the Qashgai dating from the time of Sardar Ashair, Soulet ed Dowlet, the father of Nasir. The present Kashguli Kalentars, Ilyas and Jehangir, can scarcely forget the evil that Nasir»s father did to their tribe. The Darashuri own lands west of the Shiraz-Isfahan road and would like to cultivate them in peace. None of these Khans can be really happy to acknowledge Nasir as their overlord and pay him tribute even though they are prepared to accept his collabora tion against the Government. So, as I see it, Nasir’s vaunted confederation of tribes is not a stable structure. 6. Yet the present situation Is that of stalemate. The tribes are to some degree united to resist the efforts at dis- | armament of the Government whom they all heartily hate and distrust; while the said Government has done nothing either politically or militarily to prepare for disarmament and is .now scarcely credited with the power to do so. I am convinced that if we were able to take over the administration of these tribes i.e. settle and disarm them, we should be successful and earn the gratitude both of the tribes for leading them with safety out of the impasse, and the settled populations of Pars for ridding them of the tribal pests. The solution must t obviously lie with the Iranian Government and the situation calls for an early and determined approach to the problem. As I have written previously, this should, in my opinion, take the form of political action to weaken the anti-Government bloc which action must be based on overcoming tribal distrust of the Government. Only the presence of foreigners to implement a land settlement scheme etc. will, In my opinion, convince the tribesmen that they will get a square deal. Then dis armament can proceed. A demonstration of the Government’s will and means to disarm the tribes, coupled with an acceptable settlement scheme would, I feel sure, reduce the need for bloodshed to a minimum. 7. But it is, I’m afraid, wishful thinking to suppose that the Iranian Government can, or even really wish, to Implement any plan for the tribes which will entail effort and sacrifice. So presumably the present highly unsatisfactory state of affair must continue, and we must continue to shoulder the blame from both sides (cultivators and tribesmen) for a situation which is none of our making. 8. Fortunately, as far as I can see, no immediate war time British interest is at stake so long as the present situa tion does not deteriorate still further and develop into a y general conflagration - an eventuality which I do not, at the | moment, consider likely. To prevent this eventuality, however \ I am encouraging the two officers of the 3hiraz Liaison Staff to multiply their tribal contacts. Prom Jackson’s minute (para.10) it will be seen that he offered Nasir calming advice which will, 1 hope, be accepted. I hope that the tribal liaison officers may be able to work on the same lines. But this is merely a palliative. Yours ever, (sIgned) A.J. GARDENER.- 2 - Oovernraent claiming that neither had any power whatsoever without the help and guidance of the British Government. His , implication was that we were running this country just as we wished - and even if this was not the case every action taken by the Persian Government was attributed to us. He bitterly accused us that whenever we wished not to fulfil any promise that we had made we simply used the argument that we had pro mised the Persian Government not to interfere in internal affairs. In our defence against this charge made by N.K.Q. it was pointed out that whilst he professed himself as antago nistic to the Russians he must be aware that any authority or Influence used by us would, in like measure, be seized by our Russian ally. N.K.Q. had obviously no reply to this argument. Unquestionably the matter of his election as a Deputy from the town of Shiraz is of prime importance to him - so much so that failing his election he would not even meet any Persian official unless he were to be appointed as Ustandar of Pars. N.K.Q.*8 bitter anger was very obvious and he made all kinds of wild and unguarded statements such as that he would go to India with his family and refuse to have anything further to do with the tribes - also that he might go to Bahrein if given a promise that the British would not deliver him thence to the Persian Government. 4. N.K.Q. then asked that a message be conveyed to H.M, Consul asking whether the election of his brother Malek Mansur Khan Qashgai would have our consent and approval or not? We offered to convey this message to H.M. Consul stating that we had no authority to answer such a question ourselves. 5. N.K.Q. said that a few days before the Cave liar meeting took place - whilst he was unaware of the intention to hold such a meeting - he was contacted by the Russian authorities who invited him to attack and take the town of Ispahan in which enterprise they would give him their help secretly; tanks; A/v f s and even planes were promised him. The return that the Russians wanted in exchange for this help was the complete autonomy to protect the Ispahan-Bushire road. N.K.Q. said that the Russians were by this means hopeful of getting into their hands a Gulf port. Just as he was about to make his unrecorded decision a messenger reached him announcing the proposed Gavellar conference and he immediately decided not to listen to the Russian proposals but rather to try and come to an understanding with the British. (Note: Thero have been several reports of varying degrees of reliability indicating approaches to the Qashgai by the Russians). 6. Adverting to the matter of his election as a Shiraz Deputy Naser stated that on no account would he consent to become a Deputy elected by the people of either Jahrum or Lar - or indeed from any other town than Shiraz. 7. Naser Khan repeatedly preferred the hope that the security of Pars would be entrusted to iQLm in toto when he would give such good account of himself as would lead everyone concerned to view with approval his suggestion that he be appointed Ustandar of Pars. 8. Owing to the complete failure of the crops in the Jahrum- Durab-Lar area the tribes would vacate the southernmost part of their Garmsir within the next five days and should reach the environs of Piruzabad within ten days. He was extremely grateful for H.M. Consul's kindness in sending down the mobile dispensary, but he said that It was useless to send the dis pensary to Jahrum and thence via Qlr o Karzln to Piruzabad if the idea was to serve the tribespeople. N.K.Q,. requested H.M. Consul to send the dispensary directly to FIruzabad whence it would be sent to the Khan-i-Zinlan-Khan Havis-Kazerun area after having treated the sick in the Piruzabad area. The /mobileC fd-. mobile dispensary could do a lot of work in the Khan Havis (Siakh Plain) Khan-i-Zinian and South of Kazerun country where it would encounter most of the tribes (Tribal families) on I their migration. N.K.Q. would receive and welcome Captain Garrod and his Dispensary with open arms and would be entirely responsible for their safety throughout the whole of their itinerary. 9. N.K.Q. time and time again stated that he had on numerous occasions extended the hand of friendship to the British but he had been repeatedly brushed aside - latterly with the excuse that whilst he harboured our enemies he could not be our friend. He is now waiting for some mark of our esteem since he considers that whilst our enemies are in his hands it Is tantamount to their being in ours. (Note: Subsequently arrangements were concluded with N.K.». whereby the foregoing position should be changed!). 10. We told N.K.Q. quite distinctly that it was outside our province to make any political promises but that he may be quite sure that good behaviour and a law abiding life supported by the mark of his obedience in giving us our enemies would ensure the sympathetic friendship of H.M. Ambassador and his Consular officials. (signed) R. JACKSON. A.L.O. and VICE CONSUL. co. DSO. CICI. TRN (2) CICI BD.

(Dear Gardener), I have read with ranch interest your letter Ko.374/2/44 of 'i'oc 10th ilarch and oantain tfacxson^s minute on his visit to Nasir Qashfai at Firuz&amp;bad, ana a.'R itrateful for the very sound appreciation of the aituation which you give. I think that it would be well if you wera to instruct any officers who may meet Naair in future to pour scorn on his attempts «o play off the Russians ac;feim»t us. Naeir’s statements in paragraph 5 of tv.e minute ought to have been treated with ridicule, as perhaps they were; they are clearly a complete fabrication. British officers should also refuse to listen to accusations by Jiasir that we have failed to keep pronises to him (paragraph 3). v’.e have made none. Nor should statements to the effect that we have brushed aside the hand of friendship (pararrsph 9) be allowed to pass. Nasir has consistently aided and abettea out enemies and continues to do so. ?»o have had little from him but deceit and. lies. Indeed there might be somethin*: to be said for the argument that britlsh officers should visit other Qaahgal Khans rather than Hasir and that it is rather for Nasir to come and seek our favour. This, however, is a matter I leave to your judgment. vfhile this despatch was being drafted news has been received that the Qashgai have handed over to us four German* who have been with them for some months. !faslr will no doubt claim great credit for this but he ought to have hanoea the Germans over months ago, and it is possible that he would not have handed them over even now if he had not learned that two of his brothers were in our hands. Moreover (and he should be reminded of this) he allowed Kazakovskl to escape - tne German who served him as armourer and who, knowing the country and the Persian language, is particularly dangerous.

They should be^particularly useful in maintaining touch with those aspects of the military and tribal situation that might directly or Indirectly affect British Interests; for altho\^ti there are not In Pars itself any British Interests of imme diate war-time importance, disorder in Pars may spread to areas where vital British interests are located. We must, for the present give priority to those measures that are most likely to give an Immediate return in peace for even a limited period, but you should at the same time keep in mind the fact that a day will come when, in accordance with the Treaty, our troops will be withdrawn and our main interest in Persia, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, will be dependent for its protection on the ability of the Persian Government to maintain order or on the goodwill of the tribes. &lt;D -P I o o o -p P. &lt;D o o n c cd *h &gt; O P A.J 2. I attach an extract from a letter which I wrote to Baxter about a month ago on our policy towards the tribes. Our most important Immediate object is to secure tl e elimina tion of German Influence among the tribes and the arrest of all German agents. Once this has been achieved I consider, subject to any comments you may have to offer, that our in fluence should be directed towards perauading/the tribes that they intend to adopt a firm and just policy. To the tribes, it Is true, we have little to offer since, it being the policy of His Majesty's Government to support the Central Government, we can give no encouragement to their desire for power while our attitude towards any movement In favour of local autonomy must be confined to favouring the creation of /those • Gardener, Esq*, C*B*E., British Consulate, Shiraz.mmm ■i - 2 - those provincial council* which are provided for in the ^HeUtutlon. But the visits of British officers and of MobileDiapensar/ to tribal areas and their contacts ? r ba L chi ® fa v ! ll:L &amp;t lea 3t; keep you in touch with trit ax sentiment and with movements that might develop to the detriment of our interests. They will, moreover, give opportunities of enlightening the tribes regarding the general situation and of dispelling disturbing rumours, and -tno^, ledge that the actions of both Persian authorities and tribes are under the observation of representatives of the British Government may tend to restrain both from ill- considered commitments. At the same time discretion must be exercised in deciding how far British officers should identify themselves with Persian policy towards the tribes. It seems unlikely that the Persian Government will be able to extricate themselves from their difficulties in Pars without having recourse eventually to intrigues and deceit with which we must not be associated. And we should avoid incurring unnecessary unpopularity by identifying ourselves with unwelcome measures as seems to have happened when Lieutenant Henry accompanied General Jahanbanl to announce to the Khans the disappointing decision of the Government regarding the hamassani lands. S. We cannot, however, give any assurances to the tribes other than tie general assurance that our influence with the Persian authorities will be directed towards ensuring that law-abiding and obedient tribes are given Justice and fair treatment. I realize that this will be of no great effect especially as cold justice, as in the case of the Pamassani, will not always be favourable to the tribes. But while we have troops in Persia responsible tribal chiefs, never certain that those troops will not be used against them,will, I think, hesitate to act against British interests and may be inclined to accept British advice. This will not, how ever, prevent them from acting against the interests of the Central Government. From your reports I get the impression that ftasir and Khosrow Qashgai are steaciily strengthening their position and that there is a corresponding deteriora tion in the position of the Central Govfirnmont. This is /clearlyclearly detrimental to the ultimate establishment of any stabi- lijiy in Persia, material or economic, and, if it continues, it qq,j .is bound to lead to a situation where South West Persia will be at the mercy of the tribes and where the An^lo-Irani an Oil Company, to ensure their protection, may have to revert to the policy, which experience has proved to be unsatisfactory, of subsidizing tribal chiefs, 'Whilst it is easy to dia^ose the disease it is difficult to suggest a remedy. We have too little confidence in the Persian army as it is at present to urge it to undertake operations since they would tend rather to provoke disorder than to establish security. But it appears to me that the policy of appeasement towards Nasir and Khosrow is going too far and that General Jahanbani mi;.ht adopt a less complaisant attitude and take a firmer stand against Uasir’s and Khosrow^ manoeuvres for their own aggrandisement. We hfve indeed expressed these views to him and to the Govern ment, but we have confined ourselves to general principles since it is only on the spot that the value of possible counter measures can be properly assessed. I noted the views you have expressed in your letter to Chancery K0.2159/2/43 of December 21st regarding the importance of placating the Mamassanl and I communicated them with my strong support to the Prime Ministen 4. The Shah has recently been expressing doubts of the wisdom of Jahanbani^ policy and he might recall him if any suitable substitute were available. The Q&amp;vam will resign as soon as the Pars elections are over except in the unlikely con tingency of the Government asking him to go back on his own terms. I shall endeavour to secure the appointment in his place of someone who may be expected to regard Jahanbani’s policy with an independent mind and to restrain him from un necessary concessions to Nasir and Khosrow.

Bullard's letter of 24th December^ which Foreign Office/sent us under a copy of a letter they have written to the War Office, is of interest. It is in reply to Mr. Baxter's letter of the 9th November, flagged on the attached file. The Foreign Office, aok whether we. haye n any ccranents^ ^ As regar^^the tribal situation, things do not appear to have progressed -cfel since the question was last considered here^ see the minutes at Ex t, 5 782/43 our letter to the Foreign Office of 12th November 19432 f^ere does not seem to be anything further that v/e can usefully add by way of comment. It will be noted that the Minister does not consider that there is much chance of the Russians using tribal unrest in the South asapretext for occupation of that part of the countiy by their troops (the QiAashgai country of course, lies seme distance to the South East of xhe trans-Persian railway, which is the chief route for supplies to Russia), The Foreign Office, in their latter to the Weir Office of 2 nd February, refer to the question abISit the withdrawal of Britishan^ Russian troops frem Persia af^ er the war.

Meanwhile, we are glad to note from the papers sent to us with Foreign Office memorandum, E. 811 / 155 / 34 - dated 11 th February, that the services of two British officers have been placed at the disposal of the Consul in Shiraz to assist him in his work in Fars. As you will remember, Caroe when he was here considered that the encouragement of touring by British officers in the tribal areas would be a valuable measure. ’ 7 ith regard to the position that is likely to arise in Persia at the end of hostilities, that presumably is a matter that will fall to be considered by the Post-Hostilities Planning Committee, and, we should have thought, could really only usefully be considered in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time. But generally our view would be that it would be disastrous for us to withdraw our forces from the south until we are quite sure that the Russians are going to- ^ do the same in the north. There is one further small point. When you say that the defence of Abadan and the oil area will have to be secured from bases in Iraq and on the Arab shore of the I^ersian Gulf, we take it that you have in mind air bases only^so far as the Arab States are concerned. The establishment of land forces in these States would be a different proposition altogether and might give rise to considerable difficulty with the Rulers. ^ I am sending copies of this letter to Wren at the War Office and Bridgeman of the Petroleum Department.

Our information on this subject came, if I remember aright, from a report by Lord 'iothschild on his visit to Persia. *nyhow, the main thing is that the people, on the spot now eeem to be satisfied that co-meration is adequate. As regards the tribal question, we agree with dullard's comments, which I think also generally represent your own views. e should like to draw attention to his point o. B , that we must support every legitimate effort made by the Persians to a condition to disarm the tribes. Conversations are now proceeding in Washington with a view to getting an agreed policy with the /onericans about the supply of .rms to r'ereia, and consideration is also being given to the eventual disposal to Piddle Eastern countries of surplus British war material. strengthen their irmy, in order that the may be in Lieutenant-Colonel G-.W.

Though we are not s ecifically concerned here with poet-war arrangements, 1 should perhaps mention that, in the view of the Foreign Office, there can be no question of obtaining facilities for the stationing of British land or air forces in Persia after the war, our main object being the re-constitution of eraia as an independent buffer State. The defence of vbadan and the oil area will therefore have to oe secured from bases in Iraq and £J on the \rab shore of the ersian Gulf and our treaty with ■P Iraq modified to allow of British ground-forces being maintained in Iraq.

(Dear Baxter), Your letter of November 9th about the conversation between Campbell and General Hurley. Enclosed are a few comments on those points in the conversation other than the question of security which is dealt with here. General Connolly seems to have complained to the War Department without warning General Selby, Acting General Officer Commanding, Paiforce; on the other hand General Selby says that Paiforce did not make the complaint you quote, about General Connolly’s alleged refusal to allow British troops to have access to railway installations, etc.: he supposes that General Pownall made it when he was at home before going to India. General Selby has been here recently, and he has had several talks with the Americans about security, and I hope that things will now go better. The Persians are a volatile people, particularly the tribal Persians, so that to prophesy what they will or will not do is dangerous. Nevertheless, 1 think it most unlikely that any tribal chief of importance in South Persia will lead or even abet an attack on British interests or take any other action which might bring his tribe into conflict with British troops. This does not rule out highway robbery, thieving or attempts by individuals to damage the railway or the oil installations; nor - while there are Germans about with money to spend - raids on our interests by a party of hired scallywags. But the railway is well guarded and the Germans are far away from it, and Nasir Qashgai has enough control over them to prevent their committing any attack on the railway. We still hope to secure the Germans, which would simplify the problem. Paiforce are satisfied that their arrangements for the protection of the communications, and the oil area too, are adequate. We have just been discussing the question of security at Abadan and shall be sending you some papers on the subject soon. s'irz. As I said in my tele pram No. 10 67 of the 12 th ..Qc taker (paragraph 5): , ... we are not interested in the struggle between the Qashgai and the Government as such and .... we have nothing against the Qashgai as long as the oil fields and the communications are not attacked and provided that we secure the Germans who are with the tribes. If we could secure tnese objects we should do well to slip out of the tribal business'. I You know all the objections to our playing about with the tribes - that we should get mixed up in family feuds, should encourage hopes we could not fulfil, and should weaken the Central ^Government with which we have a treaty. I thin*: that il we secure the Germans we must leave the tribes to settle their affairs/ G. y»', Bax ter, ksq#, C • &lt; - • G. , Foreign Office. Vaffairs with the Persian Government so long as our communications an&lt;^.Qil interests are not endangered. There will never be sec^ ity again in the south until the tribes are disarmed, and thavimst be done by the Persian Government. • We have nothing to** offer the tribes to induce them to keep the peace except to help, get the land claims settled and to try to secure for the tribes a fair share of social, medical and educational advantages - unless we can continue, and expand, the medical work so popular with the tribes, which has been inaugurated by the single mobile dispensary provided by Paiforce. What the tribal leaders want is to keep their arms and to be independent, and that we ought not to encourage. If as we hope Germany is defeated in a few months there will begin a period when His Majesty^s Government will no longer br interested in the security of the railway or of the roads outside the oil areas except in so far as we want security in the country in the general interest, but will still be dependent for the war against Japan upon South Persian oil, which will have to be defended adequately by some means or other until Japan is defeated. Y*e have not yet decided how the defence of the oil area is to be ensured during that period. It seems unlikely that the defence would be adequate without the presence of British or other foreign sources', but if we keep British forces in the south, the RussianswlIT either claim the right to keep Russian forces in the north and thereby prolong the paralysis which their presence causes, or else they will withdraw self- righteously and leave us to face Persian criticism alone. I do not think there is any justification for the suggestion that the Russians might use tribal unrest in the south as a pretext for occupation of that part of the country by their troops. They; are much more likely to let us become involved and then to point ( to their own policy of non-intervention, and the tranquillity in the north. However, this is a separate question. I mention it here to complete the picture. During the period between the defeat of Germany and the defeat of Japan, the Persian army may perhaps be able to tackle seriously the disarmament of the tribes. There will be some factors in their favour. The American advisers have obtained their powers and the effect of their work on the organisation should begin to show itself in at least some increase in administrative efficiency. Then the cessation of hostilities in Europe should ma e it possible for the Persian Government to obtain for their army a certain amount of transport, and weapons such as mortars and armoured cars which are useful in tribal areas. However, I do not lice to make too much of these points, for the weacest factor in the Persian army, viz. the officer, shows no sign of improvement - thanks I fear mainly to the Shah, who prefers flattery to honest administration. High boots and low morale is the mark if not the motto of the Persian officer, and the efforts of General Ridley and of the present Chief of General Staff, General Riazi, to get rid of the most corrupt and inefficient officers will continue to meet with opposition from the Shah and Razmara who go by a different criterion. Here I think is the policy we should pursue:- (1) Continue our efforts to catch the Germans; (2) If the Germans are caught, let the tribes know that we have no quarrel with them so long as they do not attack Allied/I Q A A ‘ Allied interests. Looting o# Srit^i©^ travellers, whoever they may be, is of course an attack on Allied interests so long as the war lasts, but does not call for armed intervention as a raid on the oil fields or an attempt to blow up the railway would do. (3) If the Germans are not caught we must continue to use influence with the tribes to secure them. For instance Nasir Qaahgai has two brothers, formerly in Germany but now in Istanbul. It depends on us whether these two men are allowed to go to Beirut to join Nasir's mother and consumptive sister whom Nasir wishes to send there. (4) le must support the Persian Government in their plan to disarm the tribes, on the understanding that the disarmament is general, so that an unarmed tribe is not left at the mercy of an armed neighbour. (5) In order that the Persian army may be in a condition to disarm the tribes, we must support every legitimate , effort made by the Persians to strengthen the army. I This means supporting General Ridley - a policy in which i we must not expect helo from the Soviet Government and not always from the Shah. (6) Armed intervention on our part should be:- (a) limited to the defence of our communications and the oil area, while we are still at war with Germany; (b) limited to the defence of the oil area, after the defeat of Germany, so long a&gt; we are still at war with Japan; (c) ruled out entirely when British troops have been withdrawn from Persia - within six months from the conclusion of hostilities with Germany and her associates. One exception to this might be admitted: viz. a commando raid to capture the Germans if we thought that they constituted a real menace; but it seems unlikely that Nasir (or any other tribal leader) will allow the Germans to operate against us; he will keep them - if he does keep them - as a bargaining counter; and on the other hand a commando raid could easily fail, as the Germans move about frequently. While this letter was being drafted we had news that both the Minister of War and the General Officer Commanding, Pars, General Jahanbani, were coming’round to the policy proposed by Qawam ul Mulk but received by the Persian authorities at first with great hostility viz. the policy of backing the ”loyal ,, tribes, especially the Mamassani, both in order to protect them from attack by the rebellious tribes and in order to use them against the rebels in case of need. They are even thinking of arresting Khosro, the brother of Nasir ^ashgai, for the failure of the two brothers, by refusing to hand over any rifles, to keep their promise to deliver up all the arms taken from the Persian troops. I have asked them not to take action against Khosro without consulting the Legation. As this letter covers the general problem fully I am sending copies (without copies of the enclosure,,or oi the letter to which it is a reply) to ^Caroe in New Delhi and to Prior at Bushire.

L. 0. Shiraz and to be Inclined to surrender. The War I.inister apparently expects to be able to deal with the tribes during the spring migration, but as Sir R*Bullard points out, probably Nasir will by then be strong enough to defy the Persian Army. Sir R. Bullard suggests that if we can secure that the oilfields and communications are not attacked and that the Germans are given up, we should do well to slip out of the tribal business altogether. He is inclined to'think that Qavam had better be allowed to retire with dignity on the plausible excuse that the tribes have now made their submission. It is clear, as he says, that nothing is to be hoped for from the Persian Army, and it therefore seems difficult for us to support Qavam in a strong policy unless there are British troops available to back it up. deanwhile, every effort is Ioo be made to secure the Germans, and it is at least something that Nasir has agreed to let British officers tour freely in his country. The suggestions that bribes of tea, sugar and piece-goods might be used to secure the surrender of the Germans, and that an R. A. f. aeroplane should make occasional flights over tribal areas, are being pursued. Sir R.Bullard evidently expects to get some further news on the situation shortly when the new Consul has taken over at Shiraz, and when he himself has seen General Jahanbani. We/ /We have also had a private and personal reply from the Viceroy to our telegram of October 12th. He has seen Sir R*Bullard’s repor and he suggests that the issue now boils down to the question whether or not it is safe on either the short or the long term view to stand aside and permitjtribal icpperium to be set up in the South. It is satisfactory that Sir R.Bullard did ultimately invite Sir G-.Prior’s views on the question. I have spoken to the Foreign Office, who agree that Sir R.Bullard’s report is not a reassuring one. They will probably call a further meeting shortly to consider the whole position. ( Everything seei^is to depend on whether or not any British troops could be made available; but it seems to me that the policy of settlement by negotiation with the Qashgai having been allowed to go so far, it would in any case be rather difficult to reverse it until some definite, as opposed to potential, menace to our interests has manifested itself.■NBfcMMMW..

I confess that J find it extremely difficult to make any suggestion for further action at the moment. We are still awaiting Sir R. Bullard*^ appreciation which, in his telegram No.1012 of the 21st September, he said he would be in a better position to furnish when he had the Consul 1 s-report of the War Uinister*s discussion with Qavam in Pars. The latest Shiraz situation reports, which are attached, indicate that the discussion between the War Minister, the G.O.C. and Qavam have not been a success and Qavam has rushed off back to Tehran possibly to resign* He apparently felt that the Military were establishing their own line of action and that he was not being given a sufficiently free hand* Meanwhile discussions have been held with Nasir and other Kashgai leaders and an arrangement has been reached which has put a stop to general looting by the Kashgai who will in great measure be entrusted with the maintenance of general security in tribal and bordering areas* Security on the main roadways of Shiraz has been restored arid Khosrow is shortly to accompany the G.0.C* to Firuzabad to concert security measures during the southward movement of the tribes* All this seems to indicate that, though matters cannot yet be. regarded as satisfactory, there has at least been some improvement in security and some prospect of order being maintained in agreement with the Kashgai leaders* As the policy which is now being tried has to work through the agency of the Kashgai leaders, it seems rather pointless for the Viceroy* s advisers to suggest that the right policy is to hit the Kashgais hard and quickly,at any rate until the policy of appeasement has demonstrably failed. In any case1 * I may record two points of interest bearing on this. (i) General Auchinleck in a letter to me dated 2nd September says that he (i.e. G*H*Q*) is keeping a close watch on the situation (this is in reply to a warning I sent him). He had had an appreciation, which' he had asked for from General Pownall, though he gives no details of what that contained. Auchinleck refers to 'having trouble there in the future ', that India will have to hold any Persian Gulf or S. Persian baby, and that he agreed with me that as a post war commitment India might have to police and possibly administer S.Persia at any rate for some time. He went on to say that he had not gpt any reserves available at present 4 Though at a pinch he might be able to produce something. Pownall required infantry, which was not available in India# (ii) General Pownall tackled me on the question the other day. He pointed out that Paiforce is short of troops and requires all it has got for protection of vital communica tions. He asked who was 'biting the Viceroy' about a situation which he did not regard as particularly serious or dangerous. He went on to say that Auchinleck attacked him on allowing a situation to arise which endangered Indian interests and at the same time refused to produce any additional troops. He hinted that Prior was at the bottom of the trouble. I countered by telling him that we had referred the matter to Bullard and that as Prfor was contained in Paiforce area, it seemed to me to be Pownall’s business to keep him in order. 2. I feel myself that Prior is the person who is 'biting the Viceroy' and it is wrong of him to do so if he is doing it behind the backs of Bullard and Caroe. I know Prior well and admire his qualities. On the other hand when he becomes a 'strategist' he is a public menace and he is, moreover, inclined to make the worst of a situation and revel in it. Of course in this case Priormay be right and Bullard and Pownall may be concealing things* As I said at the last meeting on the subject I donH lenow who is right, but the YiTar Office evidently back Pownall and Bullard* ■ * • • •- 3* The Viceroy’s last telegram seems to me to indicate that Prior should somehow be put on the chain* I agree with the proposals in your last paragraph, which I think is the only official line to take* But somehow vie should shut up Prior* ^ (InitId) G-*N*L:( olesworth) 7/10/43.2 .

I note in that connection Ghat G*I*C*i* iepoi g oiiicich quarters quoted that a settlement ol' Kashgai dispute is doubtful'. 2. I do not want to press this matter too far. I realise that caroe has been associated with discussions in London and he is v^ell aware of our ooint of view., position (corrupt groupjally^ is also complicated by the fact that prior, who as you know is not always v/ise in his drafting, has sent telegrams which are, not ^or the first time, not suitable for general distribution (and which were not of course repeated to Bullard). I could, if you wished, ask prior for an official appreciation of the situation, asking him go repeat it to Bunard. But I do not want to get him at odds with either Minister or Foreign office, and will await your advice as to whether if I were to ask for such an aporeciation you would anticipate any difficulty with them. Or alternatively any other suggestion to make for ironing out this business, whicn unhapoily has become more entangled owing to apparent failure of Tehran to keep prior in close \ touch. short point in the v/hole situation seems to me to be whether tribes are to be allowed to I retain the initiative or whether Persian Government and its forces are to e made, by whatever means are thought wise and practicable, to deal faithiully with them.

We are convinced that there are no grounds for (fevan's suspicions that they have other intention. On the other hand many people are ready to say that Qavam s object is to re-establish his personal ascendancy in Pars rather than Government authority, and his unwillingness to co-operate with Government forces lends force to these accusation and makes it more difficult for us to support him effectively. It seems to me that Minister for War has gone far to meet Qavam s wishes and latter should realise that I consider that his resignation now would be unjustified and a betrayal of the confidence I have put in him.

We attended the meeting at the Foreign .Office on Friday and supported the representations as to the Persian situation put forward ^ in the Viceroy's telegram* Mr. Garoe was able to give a “general explanation of the Government .of India's interest in this area and mentioned their apprehension-with an eye to the future-lest .the Russians should he given an opportunity of establishing their influence in the south. He laid stress on Sir Geoffrey Prior's special knowledge of the tribes of South Persia, which entitled any opinion from him on the seriousness of the position to be listened to with respec.t* The view of the Foreign Office, which will be found set out in the attached minute by Mr. Hankey of the 16th of September, was that the Viceroy's view of the situation was somewhat exaggerated. In their view the general situation in Persia has changed radically for the better in the last few weeks. As regards the local situation, though no-one could regard it with complacency, it is at least not worse than it was a month ago when the Viceroy pressed for the retention of an adequate British force in the Shiraz Ispahan area. This view was supported by the War Office representatives in the light of their most recent intelligence from C.I.C.I. They felt in the circumstances that it would be very difficult to make any further approach to the C.in.C P.A.I.C* as to the disposition |for use of his troops after so short an interval, in the absence of a clear and serious deterioration in the position. As regards the danger of Russia extending her influence in this area, the Foreign Office had no information to suggest that she was showing any interest in this part of Persia at all* In the circumstances, the Foreign Office did not feel that they could go further than a telegram to Sir R.Bullard which would refer to the disappointing nature of developments in the Shiraz area and would call for his appreciation of the situation. It would also remind himc of the necessity for insisting on proper support for Qavan from the Persian Government. We agreed that a telegram of this nature should he sent, and this has now been done. A copy of the .telegram is attached below. When we have Sir P. Bullard^ reply we shall be in a better position to judge how far, if at all, we can press the Viceroy’s views further. In the meantime, it will be as well to give the Viceroy, to whom the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran is being repeated, some indication of what action has been taken here on his telegram, and a draft private telegram is submitted accordingly in which Mr. Garoe has concurred.

If it vould assist in any way you may inform Prime Minister, and if necessary also the Shah, that I am greatly disappointed at failure of General Jehanbani to support Governor General’s efforts and that in view of importance to allied war effort of improving tribal situation in Pars, we feel entitled to expect that the situation v/ill be seriously taken in hand, especially now that Persia has joined United Nations* 3* To what extent is agreement reached with Khosro (your telegram No*917) being implemented?

I am convinced that this is an exaggeration. The situation has changed radically in the last few weeks* Je have £&lt;UepjEM up and disrupted most of the German Fifth Columnist machine and have even been able to arrest a number of the parachutists. The Deputy, Kaubak&amp;t, the linch pin of the Organization among the' Persians has eluded us * nd escaped to th e Qaahgai; but it is as a Deputy intriguing 4K 2S^politic&amp;l circles in Tehran that he ia dangerous, hot as a hunted outlaw chased out of civilisation into tribal territory* we have got I/ayer, one of the principle German agents ana ail his documents* So far from producing an upset, there have been practically no complaints except from relatives and Persia has since declared war on Germany. Therefore the general situation for which we wore concerned before, has im proved out of recognition in the past month. As regards the local situation, an agreement was reached in the middle of last month with Khoarow ;yiahgai, ffa sir’s brother, by whicj zai» ite sir'e brother, by whicjK £©frc^*r&lt;n ^ / fw^Khogrow rill becomefra De uty and t \e eby A* ■■ e apw° ^ 0 J &lt;*+ T« return, l^hosrow undertook on behalf ujh A Acc/&gt; 4—aimBt. in rctum ; of himself and Rasir to return all arms taken from the German forces, to restrain the Qashgai Jf^es^from disorder and robbery, to arrett and nnli fliivg. any Germans in c^ashgai territory, to allow British officials to visit Qaahg&amp;i territory not to oppose the stationing of Persian troops in any part of Pars and to remain himself in Shiraz or give Nasir's son as a hostage until Nasir left for Tehran, nasir apparently thinks the assur ances obtained by Khosrow regarding hie personal safety inadequate.and Waoir deasTiot yet aeom to tove- U.ken»*i»&gt; eenuilety ,—*¥+» Shiraz ^telegrams Hos. 56 and 62 describe the situation* 9ihAjaJ-f*&lt;* Naeir ap oars indetemino4feand meanwhile General Jehanbani and the Governor Genr ial of Shiraz are not co-operating. It seems possible that General Jehanbani has received secret orders from the Stall, who has the bravest in intrust of the Governor General for personal and family reasons. I share the Viceroy’s view that Nasir may well have entered into negotiations largely for the purpose of safeguarding the tribe’s downward migration, but on the other hand, we have always thought it improbable that Nasir would in before he was elected a Deputy. But it is untrue to suggest that the local security situation has changed for the worse. A robbery or two may have occurred, but Nasir is no longer a complete outlaw and his supporters in tlw rest of Persia have been scattered. Now that the Ghiraz route is no longer beigg used for aid to Russia, local robberies have much less significant though they do present a threat to law «nd order.Ve have already considered carefully the proposal to have British troops sent to Shiraz and have come to the conclusion that 'arhile their presence there vould be useful, we cannot press the question further in view of the ddcioion of the Commander in Chief that his forces would not be cdrrectly disposed if troops wdre stationed there. 7 eTffcced sir R* Bullard to keep the C. in C. and us fully informed regarding the developments of the tribal situation and the danger of the troubfcd spreading to tri bal areao : long the railway if it is unchecked. ft ; cannot see any justification either as regaran the general security situation or the local securit | situation for going back on this decision, ^e must trust the judgement of the men on the spot.

Please see the previous submission at Ext,if871. The Viceroy has now telegraphed again ( both by personal and by private and personal telegram, and says that having obtained an appreciation of the present position from Sir G-eoffrey Prior his anxiety as to the situation remains as strong as ever, and he fears that unless determined action is taken immediately the situation will deteriorate rapidly and with serious results. He xorges that the position should be regarded 'realistically**'* and that the minimum requirements are:- (1) That Qawam, the Governor-General in Pars, should have real and effective support from his own Government, and ( 2 ) That he should have the backing of a small mobile British force, possibly with seme air support, in order to show the tribes that we are behind them. The general facts of the situation given by the Viceroy in paragraph 1 of his personal telegram are confirmed by the latest situation reports frem Shiraz and Tehran, but whether he may not be drawing too gloomy a picture from these facts and exaggerating the danger of a widespread deterioration is impossible for us to judge here. I should have thought myself that the arrests already made would shortly produce results, and that if we go on pressing for the remainder to be rounded up and insist on Qawam being properly supported by his own Government in the South, there was a reasonable prospect that the^ersians would themselves be able to control the position with^the necessity of military support from us. But the Viceroy is evidently gravely concerned about the prospects*-* possibly with long term considerations largely in his mind, as the reference to Russia rather indicates^*and we must clearly ensure that his views are strongly represented to the Foreign Office and the War Office. We shall not get very far merely by written representations in the matter, at any rate on the departmental level, and I have therefore, /afterafter consulting Sir Leonard Walcely, asked the Foreign Office to call a meeting tomorrow at 12 o* clock to discuss the matter. representatives of the War Office to be present. I would suggest that Sir Leonard Wakely and I should attend from this office and „ that we should ask Mr. Caroe to accompany us. f * P.A.I.C. Forces * It is a little unfortunate vis-a-vis the Foreign Office that the Viceroy is relying on information received from Sir Geoffrey Prior, who is of course one of Sir R. Bullard* s consular officers and who, though he is at Shiraz, where he goes to recess, is not in charge of the Pars area. If Sir Geoffrey Prior feels, as he apparently does, that the situation has dangerous possibilities, it seems a pity that he did not telegraph his appreciation to the Minister at the same time as he sent it to the Viceroy. This would have made it much easier to deal with vis-a-vis Sir R. Bullard. For the same reason the Viceroy* s suggestion in paragraph 3 of Ms private and personal telegram that P.A.I.C. should be asked to invite Sir Geoffrey Prior to a conference would seem to present considerable difficulty, unless the Foreign Office felt inclined to put it to Sir R. Bullard as a suggestion which he himself might make to P.A.I.C. As regards the V/ar Office, the Coramander-in-Chief P.A.I.C. Force is, of course, bound by his directive which laid it down that his particular tasks were to ensure the safety of the oil producing regions and to safeguard supplies for Russia. At the same time he was given certain general responsibilities, one of which, to pay close attention to the internal security situation in order to ensure that it does not deteriorate to the detriment of the general prosecution of the war.' We can therefore remind the War Office of this responsibility, though it seems difficult to press too far the Viceroy's view that a small detachment of British troops should be used to support the Persian Army in the The Foreign Office are quite ready to do this and will invite War Office or the Foreign Office in this matter. The Government of India obviously have a considerable indirect interest in the Unfortunately we are not on strong ground either with the GttlO f- UftJl Lmff N Persian situation, particularly in the South, but the responsibility in the political sphere rests with Sir R. Bullard and the Foreign Office, and in the military sphere with the Conmander-in-Chief, ’’You are particularly enjoined*r - — . / 3. tribal area concerned. The Oonmander-in-Chief on the last occasion said very definitely that the forces at his disposal must be used to defend vital interests and were not sufficient to quell tribal revolts over wide areas and could not be distributed in small detachments to maintain Persian morale. The War Office would, no doubt, require convincing of the seriousness of the situation before they would agree to interfere with the Coranander-in-Ohief' s discretion as to the disposal of his troops. It is proposed that at the meeting we should support the Viceroy* s view as far as may be possible, and find out what action the Foreign Office and War Office are prepared to take as the result of his representations. If the results are not likely k^tSuf^iciently satisfactory to the Viceroy, the only course would-be for the Secretary of State to write to Mr. Eden and Sir James G-rigg personally.CYPHER TELEGRAM from Viceroy dated 13th September 1943. -Oll-s , n Private and personal.

Nihzati Milki has been suppressed for most violent anti-ally article in connexion witharrests. This is the organ of a party of the same name founded at Isfahan to oppose the Tudeh party. It is widely believed that the Shah is behind it, though he denies it and has authorised Minister of War to take any action he pleases as penalty for publication of article. I have suggested to the Soviet Charge d'Affaires that we should ask the Persian Government to hand over the editor at Sultanabad and am awaiting his decision. 4-.

I have however explained the misunderstanding to the Minister of tfarwho has behaved exceedingly well and has successfully smoothed over the incident and Chief of the General Staff-who had resigned nominally because of Isfahan incident, has vatadmm his resignation.

To:- H.L.Monsieur All inheily, the Prime linieler. | 343 Lateh 26th ^turdiaa 1^22 (18th August, 1943). X^«-X Your FxeeTl enoy, . With reference to the oral flisoussions in the course of wl i it was arranged that I should submit my views in writing to Y• K• i venture to submit this petition, and, while drawing your special attention to the following facts, to add that the views I am now expressing are based on a series of experience and local inform ation obtained during this period, and should these views he added to the t ooa intention of local officials, I can assure f.F. that th* troubles in the South will be settled within the earliest period with the result that security will be established throughout the South. In order that I may set forth my object giU** plainly and i/i detail, allow me to give you an account of various questions vtiuch nave been the origin of the present difficulties by mentioning them one by one as foil owe:- 1.- The Question of Security in the areas of the south Tribes* Unfortunately during the years the attitude adopted by the Government local officials towards the inhabitants and notably towards the tribes was based on oppression and injustice, and the continuance of that attitude has made the tribesmen sorauch displeasec that a full account of it, if given, would be a waste of Y.F.’a time ana would maice my letter 1 engthy. in order to maJce up for the past behaviour and to remove the anxiety of the tribesmen it wouio seem proper and opportune to appoint, at least temporarily, the leads and supervisors of the tribe of the Beads of the trices 1 families themselves. Such an attitude, if adopted, would have two results: a) If the supervisers (guardians) of each tribe be elected out of their own Heads, the anxiety of all the tribesmen will oe removed and the tribesmen will abstain from aUAing any acts which may cause disorder, and that each of them will resume lus normal life. b) In case the Heads and guardians be appointed from the most competent people of the tribes ana they oe made responsible for the security or their relevant districts, they will t with the help of their friends and relatives establish order ana security in theix districts in every way, and it is not supposed that any of the individuals and families of the tribes will be willim when having their guardian from their tribe, to have recourse to some activities which might Jeopardise security in their own respective regions. Tiieref oreTherefore I am of the opinion that in case the Tiews expressed above are agreed to Dy f.E. ana that you wl‘H cause them to oe put into effect, oraer ana security will soon be restored throughout tribe- arntn*s regions in the ^outh. In the meantime I thinx it necessary to point out the two fol^^ing questions, and to draw f. ? . f s attention thereto: 1 . - at the same time that the supervisor and the II ichan of eaoh of the trioes kre to be chosen and ejected from a/nong themselves, it y/ou^d be necessary that the officials of the Imperial Government should extend their help, so that airect coanuaisation should be established between the tribesmen anc the Government officials, and at the same time the intentions ana directions received from the Capital may be comtiunicatea (to the tribesmen) and put into force. 2. - In view of the fact that the ashga*! tribe enjoys fWtlmlmff distinction in the Southern regions, ana that mnaeeir&amp;ble and regretful events which may arise on the part of other tribes in the remotest corner of the country will be attributed in the Capital to the c ashgai Ixadaxa tribesmen who will be accused of it, with a view Co removing the difficulty it would seem desirable, subject to your approval, that the gashg&amp;'i leaders may take part in the settlement of the affairs of other trioes in the Couth, and to allow them to cooperate with the Government officials in removing such difficulties. The above was an account of the chief problems the en forcement of which is of essential necessity with a view to restoring order and security in the regions of Southern tribes. I hereby undertake both for myself and jn behalf of my brother, ir. Muhammad hassir Cashga 1 !, to accept responsibility for preserving the security in the ^ashgai region as well as the responsibility for any kina of undesirable events with the enforcement of the points raised above. 2 .- (uestion of winter and summer quarter* of the Southern tribes. Y. JL. * s careful study in the past all ows me to consider the question of the moving of tribes for their suraaer and winter quarters as one of the important matters relating to the tribes, and to submit my views on the matter. Am long as the tribes in Uin south are not made *takht qapu* (settlers in town) in accordance with a correct procedure and tribal customs and ru^es, the question of their migration from winter quarters to summary quarters and vice versa is of greatest importance from the point of view of keeping their cattle anc animals, since it would be as though giving a sentence of death if they are ordered to remain in a place and forbid them not to move from one p^aoe to another. On the other hand, as one third of the country’s population consists of the tribes.and tim o a patI# of 'tiic 8»nci foodstiMH3 in ^^6 oo sin try sltc prociti 33 Cl tha^iks tD 'tiift cffoyfeo ol 1 »rib 68 f th? rioiTnal life of trices should be assured, the great interests o. the country d.e?flQ.iid thet ■various Goverh&amp;ent of the tifiie should tax** Glieotive steps to supervise the trioea and educate the® (? look after them)* Ihe only action which should he taken hy the Governiaent is to authorise the moving tribes from their euaaer quarters to their quarters atid vice versa# And while taking into view that one sou x risers, ’kaTs itars* and the , lcad 1 ; chuaas , are held responsible for the 5 &amp;aintenance of order, security and prosperity of the ti l oes in the South and of the places situation along the itinerary of the tiibee, it is not supposed that there would he any grounds r anxiety as to the migration of tribesmen to their sunijer sno winter resorts# 3 #- p ie at ion of the free electi ons# As at presehi oert Tin genera*! questions are discussed which are closely related to the vital life of the tribes, 5f#E* may wish me to submit my views in coaneotion with free elections* In view of the explanations offered in connection with the migration of tribes from their summer to their winter quarters , it was clear that all the tribesmen are not settled in a oorner for the whole year, and therefore at this time of elections certain difficulties are bound to arise as to electing deputies for the Mantis* As trioesmen nave -formerly petitioned to the competent Quarters telegraphically &amp;nd requested that a deputy may be c no sen direct for the Southern tribes, I hereby state that I am of the opinion, just to save trouble to individual tribesmen, th^t if the Government on vllTj.ous ti ies, pay cue attention ttO this vital and social cuestion and appoint an independent and direct deputy for them, the result would bethat in future not only the tribesmen will he more familial' and interested in the principle of centra* i sat ion, this would be an effective hel p to the question of their * taxhte qapu 1 • It would also render all tribesmen of the South submissive to the orders of the centr 1 Government in the best manner# 4 , - t^ u. 3 stion of pr operty of S outher n tribes# It ao tToal exp erienc© has shown that tile pd icy atf whi oh was adopted last year as to the exchange of property b# on&amp;ing to tribes men not only aid not give tne satisfactory result, but yielded irreparable losses for the proprietors ana also oaused insol vable dixiioulties for the Government on various periods# After the events of Shahrivar 1320 the Government on various occasions have realised the defects and difficulties caused by the laws relating to wxchange of property in such a way as to abolishing the effects (?) thereof by returning certain seized property to their owners# One of the causes of dissatisfaction felt by all the tribal individuals in the South derives oi the enforcement of the law concerning exchange And confiscation of their property and their handing over to other people# I regret to have to say that a great part of insecurity in the south regions 'exjnaasing and seiziag of property beiongiag to tiiem, TJie aiffiouVties mentioned above oan be solved by adopting the two following principles.: a) fhe Government shoulci, while realising the necessity of deciding that property belonging to individual tribesmen, either Heads, Jcaa-y icnuuas, Jcdiantara etc., shoul d be returned to th. send a represents* tive with full authority to tne South to investigate the precedents of^u matter, the owiiership of eaoh of them, ana to remove legal ana^^rctioa! difficulties existing on the way of the return of these properties, ihe decision of the representative should be considered as final by both the Goveiniaeat and the owner of property. b) As former officials, without oaying the Teast attention to the law concerning exchanging of property, which consists in giving a property in exchange tor inotner one seised, used to seize the property of Individual tribesmen first and to give or do not give at all after a long time something in exchange to the owner of the property contiseated and in the latter case in an unsufficient m&amp;xaner, the Governments representative duly invested with full powers, who is sent by the Government to the South, should at onoe return to the original owners the properties which may be in the hands of private Individuals or in tne hands of the Government - since the Government had never had the right to dispose of such property. As regards those properties for which other properties have been given in exchange, previous formalitiee Siould be cancelled, ana after original, propertiejte are returned to their owners, the properties given to them in exchange should be recovered from them. £.- Income o f seized prope rty. One of fhe o i h e r ^ fund amen t al difficulties whic^i has caused dissatisfaction for the tribesmen m the bouth consists of the income of thp properties which nave been seized for the last few years, which has been collected oy finano 1 al agents as deposit or rents and Drought into the account of Financi Agencies without paying a single cent to the owners of properties concerned. The same representative duly invested with full powers who will be sent by the Governiaent to settle the question of property in the south, will examine uhs accounts of the income of the seized property and return same baoic to the owners. The above was an account of my benevolent views which I thought necessary to submit to ¥•£• In conducing, I oeg to add that in case Y.S. will consider my sincere statements to be correct ana well-faunaea ana cause them to be put into effect, I can assure that all the difficulties which exist at present will be removed and that I shall be honoured with settling them.

[Begins] The public is informed that a German organisa tion has recently been discovered which had been set up to carry out spying activities and sabotage; it had been divided into various branches and was directed by German agents who were illegally living in Persia. It has become known that this organisation was planning an insurrection and armed action against the Government; and also that it v/ished to destroy &lt; the bridges and tunnels on the railways and cut lines of communica tion, in order to prevent transport of military stores lor the Allies and to interrupt means of transporting goods needed, by Persia and consequently to create a state of disorder in the country and disturb friendly relations of Persia and the Allies. Unfortunately a number of Persians are_suspected of takung part in these activities and co-operating with the German agents. Accordingly in order to safeguard the interests of the country and in view of Persian Government s obligations under the Treaty of Alliance, steps have been taken to arrest these persons in order that they may be interrogated. Anyone who has any information about the activities of this organisation or about the whereabputs of Germans who are in hiding is requested to communicate it to the Central ronce Administration.

PAIC, in telegram No© 58750 of August 13th (repeated to C-in-C. India), that they confirm the policy out line d by him, viz* - (i) that the troops which had been employed in guarding the Bush ire-Shiraz road should be withdrawn to Qum, and, • 3-v..—* j i.. .JL„ (ii) that in general, troops in his Command must be located ncwr where they would, be available for rapid action in defence of vital interests, instead of being dispersed in tribal areas or to maintain Persian morale. The latter course would only play into the hands of the Germans, whose policy is apparently to force PAIC to extend its commitments, thus necessitating reinforcement of the Command. The War Office telegram added, however, that, in the opinion of the Foreign efface^the mere presence of troops in the Fars area might hav^^SS^^-effect on the tribes and so prevent the outbreak of trouble. The telegram also noted that the C-in-C. was leaving a battalion tenporarily at Isfahan. (b)/rira. r ^ 2 . ('b) Sir R. Bullard has reluctantly acquiesced in the C-in-C *s statement of policy (Tehran telegram to Minister of State No. 400). * ! (c) Qawam U1 Mulk, an influential tribal leader, has been appointed Governor-General of Pars and has arrived in Shiraz. Sir R. Bullard is pressing the Persian Government to give him the fullest support. (d) Three Germans have been captured by the British Security authorities. One of these is Franz Mayer, the Chief German dLgent in Persia and the organizer of the plot discovered in Isfahan last year. The other two arrived in Persia more recently by parachute. There appear, however, to be other Germans at large in Persia, particularly in Qashgai territory.* • (e) Steps are also being taken for the apprehension, by either the British or the Persian authorities, of a number of Persian fifth columnists, notably the Majlis Deputy Naubakht, whom Sir R. Bullard describes as the mainspring of the Axis conspiracy on the Persian side. (f) Khosrow Qashgai, the younger brother of Nasir, the leader of the tribe, was induced to go to Tehran to discuss tbe terms luiAkthe Persian Government. In consequence a bargain hag been struckGovernment and the Qashgai. We have no definite account of its terms, but apparently Nasir is to be allowed to stand as candidate for the Majlis and the lands he claims are to be returned to him or referred to a Coninission; while Khosrow is to be made Governor of Firuzabad, the Qashgai headquarters. In return the Qashgai will hand over some arms and deliver up any Germans in their territory. H.M.

JJJJJJ SECRET. tebtf My telegram No* 908* At the request of the Prime Minister I discussed Pars situation wifh him and Jahanbani General Officer Commanding Pars August 17th. British Military Attach^ and Colonel Robert took part in the discussion. The Prime Minister and Jahanbani admitted that- they have not the power to reduce the tribes to submission at present and propose trying tc bring about the following arrangements: | (1) Khosro, who is the younger brother, to be Governor of ; -Firuzabad. Title would be that of an ordinary Governor but he would be in practice Ilkhani of Kashgai, since he would*not stay at Firuzabad but would migrate with the tribe for the winter. The Government would not force all Kashgais to submit to Khosro* On the contrary they would try to win some sections away from him just a v s they would tiy to' split Boir Ahmedi by ,negotiation* (2) Khosro or Nasir to hand over certain rifles and machine guns which the Kashgais captured from the Persian anny. (3) Nasir to come to Tehran as a candidate for the Majlis* As he would ; stand for Firuzabad there could be no doubt of his success.' Jahanbani suggested-that as the seat is vacant Nasir should be elected now at a by-election but the Prime Minister rightly objected to this as an unnecessary humiliation for the Government as the general election is just about to begin* It is possible that Nasir will refuse to come to Tehran until he has acquired immunity as a deputy* In that case Jahanbani proposes to keep KhoSro in Shiraz for the present. I asked Jahanbani to warn Nasir that if he continued to intrigue with the Gcimans hence- • forth I would not guarantee my Government would recognise his parliamentary immunity*r • * 1 - 2 - (»\ t and'q* claimed by Nasir, which are in the hands of the toe™S, to tTretumsd it once.

V i5. ^ {/L •n Jy'K h &lt;^X4 ir* Situation in South Persia. Ihiring the last war the Persian Government was too weak, to enforce its neutrality in face of the territorial ambitions or strategic preoccupations of the warring powers. Persia therefore rapidly deteriorated into a battlefield where at one time or another forces representing all the belligerents contended. In the South ; German and Turkish consuls and agents ^ prepared the way for aggressive action by Turkish invading troops ~ -C °v '• - and Persian tribes and gendarmarie under German influence. Thus the British Government, who at first aimed at confining their ^--v. , comnitments in Persia to the minimum, found themselves obliged to intervene on an ever-widening scale. In 1915 British troops * occupied first Ahwaz and later the town and peninsula of Bushire. In the same year there was established the East Persia Cordon, which involved British patrols from the Indian Ocean to Birjand. By Januaiy 1916 the situation in Pars had so far worsened that it became necessary to extend British intervention to the interior; and, with the approval of the Persian Government, a force of Persian troops under British Command and control was organised under the name of the South Persia Rifles. In May of the same year a force of 800 Indian troops under 3irP. Sykes advanced to Kerman and later in the same year occupied Isfahan and Shiraz. But this did not suffice for the pacification of South Persia, and fighting continued between the tribes on the one hand and the Indian troops and the South Persia Rifles on the other. In September 1918 it was found necessary to despatch an expeditionary force of 11,000 men to re-open the Bushire-Shiraz road, a task which was not completed until January 1919* Y- AuC (Aj L rL Kfrz cl ui' fp, U. t-cKou) /a&gt; A-/L/CUO jC ^ sfoU'C kiJ (Uj^b*** C%* Ml'- k C.t- ^ V u‘ 2. On the denunciation in 1921 of the AngLo-Persian Agreement of 1919* the South Persia Rifles were disbanded. Pars, like the rest of the country, thereupon relapsed into a state of chaos from which it was rescued by the drastic measures of Reza Shah. These measures included the subjugation of the tribal areas by the reconstituted Persian arny, the removal of the tribal chieftains and the confiscation of their lands. 64 C./ 4&gt;* VCVo &lt;t/i P. /?&lt;£. 5*/3 . The Central Government thus secured a control over South Persia which they retained until the Anglo-Russian invasion of* August 1941 a.nd the abdication of Reza Shah in the following month. The Persian Amy thereupon largely disintegrated, many of their arms falling into the hands of tribesmen; and a number of tribal leaders escaped from detention, returned to their areas and agitated for the restitution of their lands, ^he successive Governments which have held office in Tehran since the autumn of 1941 have been able neither to subdue the tribes by force of amis nor to pacify them by redressing legitimate grievances and granting them a measure of autonony under their more loyal chieftains. In Pars the chief centre of disaffection has been the Qashgai area south of the Bushire-Shiraz road. There Nasir Khan Qashgai, with his headquarters at Firuzabad and Farrashband, has successfully defied the Central Government, has carried on constant intrigues with other tribes, and has been repeatedly reported to be ^ ^ harbouring German agents. The documents seized by the British authorities in Isfahan last year showed that Nasir was deeply implicated in the plot to raise the country against the Allies during the expected Genian invasion through the Caucasus. The situation of the Qashgai lands, across the supply route from Bushire and within striking distance of the Gulf aerodromes and some of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s workings, gave this tribe special opportunities for damaging Allied interests. 5 . Following trouble last autumn between Persian troops and tribesmen ,mi grating across the Bushire-Shir az road, the Persian Government early this year appointed Iviarshal ohahbaKhti Commander of the forces of the South and Governor General of * Pars, and instructed him to restore the authority of Government throughout the Province. After considerable delay - caused partly by the.inability of the British military authorities to implement their promise to provide him with transport and partly/wtmm wmm 3. partly hy lack of support from the Central Government - the Itosha! startod military operations against Nasir Qashgai on ^2nd, By June 12th the Persian forces had taken Piruzabad and the other main Qashgai centres, and Nasir was a V© # 6. This success, however, was more than counter-balanced the foilowing month by a disaster in the tribal area further north. The Persian garrison of about 900 men at Semirum (south of Isfahan near the Shiraz road) was overwhelmed by a large force of Boir Ahmedi and Qashgai tribesmen. This has led to a serious deterioration in security throughout the province. Moreover^ there have recently been apparently reliable reports that a small number of German parachutists have landed in the tribal areas. 7. The Hussian supply convoys on the Bushire-Shiraz road have now ceased . (The reason for this may be that the rather makeshift assembly plant for lorries at Bushire is being dismantled; and in any case this route has never carried more than a small proportion of the aid-to-Russia traffic.) As a consequence the British i.!ilitary Authorities, who are responsible for security on all the Persian supply routes outside the Russian zone, propose to withdraw the troops who have been guarding the road. H.M. Consul at Shiraz,with the support of H.M. Minister at Tehran, has urged that in view of the very unsatisfactory situation in Pars, a British force should be retained for a time in the neighbourhood of the Isfahan and Shiraz road (Tehran Telms. Nos. QJJ and 838)* Sir G. Prior,who has been visiting Shiraz, has telegraphed (No. T/ 366 ) to the same effect; he consider 9 that unless the present threat to security is met without delay there is every prospect that the whole of South Persia will relapse into the chaos from which - as described above - we rescued it with so much effort after the last ufer. His ^presentations have been vigorously supported by telegrams from the Government of India and the Viceroy, which will be found immediately below. 8. F.O. Telegram No. 2499 of August 7 th asks the Minister of State to discuss the situation urgently with the British Military Authorities in view of the danger to our interests and to Persian internal security if the spread of trouble is encouraged by the withdrawal of our troops. It/4. It is understood that the Minister of State has replied to the effect that he considers security to be adequately ExT. safeguarded by dispositions of our forces. j Meanwhile, the C. - ih - C.,Persia-Irafe. Command, has telegraphed^ 0 ^, to the War Office opposing any alteration in the arrangements '— whereby his troops South of Isfahan are to return northwards tS w£ Quicn and Sultanabad (See telegram No. 0.C./212 of August ^ ^ j alL.uulnid i‘ii-e-u. CefXj kd&amp;VT) It is learnt from the Foreign Office that they have discussed the matter with the War Office who are reluctant to instruct General Pownall to modify this programme; though it is possible that some troops may remain at Isfahan. There is accordingly a grave danger that all British troops will be withdrawn from the Shiraz-Isfahan area. In these circumstances it is proposed that the Government of India’s official telegram should be passed on to the Foreign Office with the Secretary of State's stroi^est support. A draft letter for this purpose follows. As the matter has already been discussed 'ice and the War Office it seems desirable arrange, while matters remain as they are, for telegrams to and from Tehran to be repeated to Sir G. Prior. The reference in the official telegram to the possible threat to 'our interests in the whole of the Gulf area' suggests that in putting forward this suggestion the Viceroy has in mind Sir G.Prior's position as Political Resident in the Persian Gulf rather than as Consul- General at Bushire* Eut in view of the fact that in the latter capacity he is Subordinate to H.M. Minister, the Foreign Office might well be reluctant to instruct Sir R. Bullard to repeat to Sir G. Prior all his telegrams on matters of high policy. If it should be desired, however, we will discuss the Viceroy's suggestion orally with the Eastern Department. soon as possible. 9* Para. 2 of the Viceroyh telegram suggests that we should So i uDRAFT LETTER Ext.4499/43 The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.7.1. \ II.U.SD IATE ) BY RAND i3AUG Sir, /943 T 7ith reference to the correspondence including Foreign Office telegram to the Minister of State No.2499 of August 7th last, I am directed by the Secretary of State for No.6654 / India to forward herewith a cony of a dated 10/ August./ telegram from the Government of India Copy for Wcg. to go under cove^ to Col.

It Would be hard to explain convincingly why these people present a greater threat to our : security‘now than they did when their intrigues were first discovered. Unless, therefore, we can produce new and convincing evidence on security grounds against these suspects whom it is desired to arrest, I think we shall have to drop this proposals At the same time, I see no reason why we should tolerate the continued employment in hi^h pD^-itions of persons involved iruvtbe* plot r . I was not aware, that the present head of the gendarmerie had helped Mayer to escape. We could certainly insist on his dismissal and at the same time veto the appointment to high posts of.any officers or officials implicated in''the' plot. I have of course no objection to ^ the arrest by the Persian authorities of any of these men,' but I share your scepticism as to the likelihood of the Persian police actually arresting them, even if the Government could be prevailed upon to agree that they I- should be arrestedo • A V * [Copies sent to Mr. 'Armstrong]./itFA/$ f/iy- ■ •'. . _■&gt; &lt;e.* [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

Repeated to Deputy Minister of State, Cairo; Minbranch; Government of India; Kuibyshev; Shiraz; Isfahan; Saving. q q • q IMPORTANT . My telegrams Nos. 787 and 808, In view of the serious deterioration of the‘general political situation and the possibility of the breakdown of the Government which has been aggravated by the tribal victory in the south, and of the effect which this is bound to have on: (a) security of Bushi re-Isfahan road; (b) wheat collection; (c) position of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at the fields and Abadan and (d) our various supply routes to Russia, I hbve taken advantage of the Commander-in-Chief 1 s visit to Tehran to review the whole position. 2. As a result of failure of Shabakti's campaign and of his alleged refusal to return to Pars and as employment of British troops in punitive action against tribes is out of the question except in cases of self-defence or in protection of our vital interests, it was considered the solution should be found on the following lines: /(a) •»•2 (a) olearance for 550 lorries from Bushire by road under strong convoy of British troops starting as from about July 23rd # Proper warning would be given to tribes in advance to abstain from any offensive action against these convoys. Whole matter is in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief. (b) in view of the complete inability of the present Prime Minister to handle the situation and of his insincere and vacillating attitude on all political issues, his replacement as soon as possible by Ali Mansur who seems to be the only alternative at present. I have already discussed matters with my United States colleague who is in general agreement, provided that he has nothing to do with it, as his Government would probably prefer not to intervene in any way* The Soviet Chargd d ! Affaires, whom I also consulted, was non-commital but doubted whether Ali Mansur, in view of his previous record, enjoyed much popularity in the country. (c) appointment of Qavam ul Mulk as Governor-General of Pars with wide powers including raising of tribal levies both from his own tribes as well as from Mammassani and anti-Nasir sections of the Kashgai. For this he would need funds and amis. The question of funds of course would be for Dr. Millspaugh and he would, I am sure, be prepared to make them available as he re-gards security as number one priority. Qavam should be given the right to select his own amy commanders and be assured in advance by the % Ministry of War of full co-operation and assistance of the Persian aimed forces. Further, he would have to be given powers within the limits set by the Persian Government to settle tribal differences as far as possible by diplomatic methods. Mammassani land claims would have priority. Appointment of a few Persian speaking British officers to 'give advice and moral support to friendly tribes was regarded as desirable if they can be made available. (d) full use to be made of the existence of last yea^s , plot through publicity channels and by arrest by [? grp. ? omitted] of dangerous Persians whose disappearance would have / a salutary effect. It would be useless to rely on the Persian police in the case of arrests particularly where Persians were of any prominence.

Survivors are now reaching Isfahan. Attackers variously estimated at 1,500 to 4,000 mostly Boir Ahmedi v/ith some Kashgai of Darashuri clan. Latest reports are that Bakhtiari were not involved. Tribal force has not since then made further aggressive move but Isfahan and Shiraz road must be considered unsa.fe for the present. Persian forces in the Isfahan area are reported to be greatly demoralised and incapable even of defending Isfahan if the tribes should attack. All available reinforcements which amount however to only two battalions have been sent from Tehran. 2. Unless Persian, Government takes early and forcible measures to restore the situation intransigeance of all Persian tribes is likely to increase, collection of harvest will be seriously handicapped end disorder may eventually spread to important lines of communication and to the oil areas. There is some suspicion that Boir Ahmedi tribes are I acting under the influence of German agents* ^ It is not 1 improbable that there are Germans with the Boir but it is not ye£ proved. ' If it is true the Germans yill presumably endeavour to direct Boir Ahmedi a.gainst British interests. 3.

G.H.Q. Paiforce agreed to provide the Persian Army and Gendarmerie with certain stores and equipment in return for which* General Shahbakhti was required to ensure the safety of the road and re-establish control over the area. Operations against the QashgJUhave been delayed, however, owing to the inability of the British Military Authorities to supply the promised transport. Reconnaissance ^istobe made for the new alignment of the Bushire-Shiraz Rbacuas^I^gested in paragraph 10 of the minutes of the Bushire ^Conference and General Shahbakhti is required to be prepared to open up the alternative road via Parrashband and Firuzabad should its construction be found necessary.

A .Staff is being ap*Hta appointed to assist you to carry out these duties. Political liaison is already provided for through the British Consul and the A.L.O. working with him. You will work in close cooperation with the British Consul and inform him of all important military matters so that H.M.Minister in fRERAN can be kept informed. You will report direct to PERSIA and IRAQ Force on all matters, sending a copy to Comd 12 IND DIV. It is the policy of H*M*Government to give all assistance possible to the PERSIAN civil and military authorities in ‘ maintaining security on the road BBS!IIRE^CHHiAZ-ISFAHAN and. In furtherance of this policy, the C-in-C is providing the Governor of PARS with a limited amount of transport, clothing, blankets and rations for the use of the Gendarmerie. Also, he is providing some armoured lorries and load carrying lorries for the use of the PERSIAN Army to help it maintain efficient garrisons in the area. You will watch to see that the assistance for the Army and Gendarmerie Is properly applied, that the men actually receive the clothing and rations and that. In general, transport is used for proper purposes and kept in good order. A memorandum on what C-in-C requires of General SEAKBAXHTI is attached in Appendix ‘A 1 . You will observe the action taken by Coranmdera of the Army and Gendarmerie and give advice when necessary* You will watch to see that security is maintained by Just treatment of the Inhabitants and tribesmen of the area, and that the assistance afforded by us to the PERSIA:® is not used to oppress or undeservedly punish tribesmen or settled inhabitants, as such a line of conduct would ultimately reduce the security of the whole area. The officers of your Staff, which Includes a medical officer, will work to establish good relations between the British and the tribes. You can obtain from OHO, up to 6500 a month which may be distributed in cash or goods, at your discretion, to tribesmen or needy villagers. This distribution should be regarded not as bribes but as a means of facilitating our friendly contact with the tribes • Part of this allows nee may be used as entertainment allowance. All sums of money spent must be accou ted for to GHQ,. The C-in-C wishes you to make General SHAHBAKHTI aware that his success In maintaining good order in PARS will not go unrewarded.

The Shiraz Diaries contain many references to attacks or* convoys and travellers on the Bushire-Shiraz Road and to the pursuit of the robbers by militaiy patrols, Aranieh or #hijkaLa.. The Diary for August 1st to 15th says 'It is to be feared that only half hearted attempts are made by the Amnieh officers and men to cope with the robberJp^nds on the Road', and instances are quoted of Amnieh and Shlglcats being held up and robbed of their arms and uniforms by the bandits. Later in the month additional road guards were posted in the Shiraz-Kazerun Section. The Diary for October 1st to 15th speaks of the Road being patrolled by one or two armoured cars. The Diaiy for November 16th to 30th says 'There is an improvement to oe observed in the security measures taken by the Gendarmerie and military,' The latest Diary we have received, however,^th^d: for January l6th to 31st ? says that reports that the HhirkatH were aiding and abetting robbers committing acts of banditry on the Road were being investigated.

There is nothing in the Bushire or Shiraz Diaries to suggest that any attempt is being made at present to put into action the schemes for the building of a new road via Piruzabad and ParrashAbad or for the re-alignment of the pre sent one. A map is attached which marks the places named fo^Jin^the Minutes of the meeting. The Bushire Diary for January, 1941 &gt; mentions repairs to the Bushire-Shiraz Road, and though the Shiraz Diaries which date from July, 1942^ contain many references to road contractors - Kampsax Comsortium and Messrs. Michel Saab and Company - and to labourers working on the Road, it is clear that they are concerned with the maintenance of the existing Road rather than its re-alignment. Paragraph 12 of Shiraz Diary No.24 for l6th to 31st December reports this meeting, stating that its recommendations had been aH^pms&amp;ed. suWitfec^ ~ffieye is nelTiinq lr &gt; Sobgeaoent Leleavft'mS !b Soq^esL 4iai lAew (3)/ avrc ^ been &gt;a ^ &gt;$etp &lt; -&gt;e\ info2 (3) Nasir Qashgai &lt; The latest information about Nasir Qashgai is that, despite the non-arrival of his promised transport, the Governor-General (Sipahbod Shahbakhti) sent him a letter containing a final warning to come and discuss his grievances at Shiraz, To this Nasir replied with a reqJbst for time to consult the neighbouring tribes to whom he said he was bound by an oath of allegiance. Having done so, he would come.either with them or alone, Shahbakhti was not replying to the note and, according to a telegram from Shiraz dated 20th March, said that he would advance upon Firuzabad within the next ten days when he hoped his animal transport would be ready. An earlier telegram reported that the Governor- General intended to impose martial law in Shiraz to try to stop the free communication between Nasir and his supporters in Shiraz and Tehran. (4) Development of Bus hi re Port. The Bushire Diaries do not give a clear picture of the development of Bushire port. Ships anchor seven miles off the shore and goods are then transported to lighters and taken to the Customs yard. In November last year the I.W.T. had two taaSico and five barges. The U,K,C.C. have an assembly plant for lorries which was expanded in January, 1942. The layout of their assembly y a rds was revised in April and again apparently in December, 1942 • it » A new assembly line for Delta pack trucks was completed in October and the last Diary which we have received, that for December 1st to 15th, said that it was hoped to get some Bren carrier track for a **moving belt'* system of assembly. The Political Resident visited the U.K.C.C. assembly line in October and was impressed M by the practical results achieved with the modest equipment supplied to them' • He was indignant that no more modern equipment had been made available.

NonL,- has yet reached Tehran. The whole situation changes when the. tribes begin to migrate at the end of March, and if firm actio, is not taken by then, security is likely to deteriorate. Delay in beginning (operations is creating doubts of the Government^ intentions to implement announcement of policy of restoring their authority m^Fars and is encouraged by Nasir and the tribes.

'3. It is considered that the mobile defence (thAt is offensive | action short of major operations) should be entrusted to the rersian Army subject to the provision of necessary equipment and supervision. The security of areas adjacent to the road cannot be divorced from the protection of the road itself and would be the concern of the Persian Army. 4. The presence of large units of the British imperial Forces without definite military objectives would only encourage the Persian Army to divest themselves of their responsibility and to tie up British Forces in this manner would be uneconomical. The occasional flagmarch of a mobile unit with superior equip* ment, especially during the season of Tribal migration would, hov/ever, have a good effect. 5* Great importance is attained to the presence of lorries but it is not thought that the Persian Army could man them or collaborate usefully in this and they must therefore be provided and operated by the British Forces. 6. It was thought (Colonel pybus and Captain Howes dissenting) that some closer contact (including medical) with the tribes, would be advantageous, rovided suitable officers could be found. Mr. Brenan considered that it was not practical politics at the present moment to attach a British officer to the ^ash- qais, until Persian Government authority was re-established in : that area. 7. Since it ia recommended that the static and mobile defence should be entrusted to the Gendarmerie and the Persian Army it is not possible to make use of the tilbes for security purposes except by small scale local employment within these forces. Some improvement in security could be made by employing tribes- | rnen cm road work, where available and willing to work. Subsidies whether in the shape of oash or commodities are ruled out of consideration except in return for services performed. 8. in Shiraz there is already a Political officer (in the shape; of H.ll.Consul) and an Intelligence Officer (the A.L.O.) who will shortly be given an assistant.

I -rust, however, that r^y language and attitude towards him as set out in % record were appropriate. • Beyond alluding in eneral teme to Germane amongst the eShgsl, and to hinting, that we were not without inf oration', X wa* careful to avoid mentioning any specific information. In the course of the conversation I ascertained th«t he had never been to ^’arrashband itself and thet although he knew of the two visits of planee to Flruzabad and Farraahband, he did not know ;';f aBir’s letter to me (see my telegram ' 0.^90 of nth . oygmher. ___ or could he give an expi^natiofr about the display of the * vhite and green sign. hile obviously Fhoerow knows ore then he was yet ready to disclose I derived the opinion, on a first inc^racaion, that he has something in him and is a young man to whom m could usefully extend a helping hand. I received Kliosrow ssh&amp;ai this morning. Mr. Belgrave. a.t .O. was present. The need to see him today was dictated by the fact that he had to leave today for Pirussabad to contact his brother Kaslr. 3. Khosrow impreeeed ue both favourably. He was a student cf the American College in Tehran and says he knows s little 'Sn^lish. I did not try him out on this. He has, for a coshgai, a pleassnt, frank manner and a good appears nee. $• The interview was long and began by his telling me all about his early life in Tehran and the miseries nnd harshness inflicted on his mother and his family before and after the death of his father in prison. Ms object in doing this was £0 try and make me under stand the underlying cause for the fears inherent In hia family of further molestation by the Persians. His talc, whleh need not be told here, was one which would naturally create sympathy. 4# At an appropriate m ment I brought him to the situation pre vailing today and said that whatever may have happendd in the past ■•net bow deal with the present. For the last year there has been a state of insecurity and general uncertainty prevailing in this province; the ftovemviMnt, and I personally had been directing our efforts towards trying to induce his brother to come and submit to the Oovemmcnt and lead the life of a noroal citizen. Unfortunately all the evidence showed that, while on the one hand professing friendship towards the British, and mlstruet of the Persian Govern ment, TTaslr shilly-shallied and had been busy ^ trengthening his hand, with what object at the time, was net lear. e had now I have the honour to be etc.etc. (Igd. y-KS, K.r.Consul Hr . .Bullard!

He explained that what he wanted to do firet wee to to to his brother and try and persuade him to throw his hand in and to rive him, Fhosrow, all the in; omation he could so that he could co^e back to me and tell me ev rything. ere he mentioned that *a friend of your’c came Ui told me this morning that he ehoulf -onfess to me dbout 22 JJ 2 ?* tha fM!hfolo.(thl^ rresumably was : ooahang, son of ■ bdul Majid,; He kn^w absolutely nothing about any Germans unless the so—eelled white Russian T akander was a German.

Tehran Saving. Commander-in--Chief P.^.I*C. is very concerned at the state of insecurity in tribal areas of southern Persia through which run the lines of communication vital for purposes both of aid to Russia and future operations. Measures of improvement which he is examining with His Majesty’s Minister Tehran will detail three officers to handle treatment of political side of security relations with the tribes in the neighbourhood of the Road, General Wilson estimates that he will need three officers who must have knowledge of Persian language and if possible experience of southern Perisa. Commander-In-Chief has asked my assistance in finding personnel, 2, &lt; attempts are being made to find two Persian speaking officers from military sources. For senior post requiring an .experienced man both General Wilson and His Majesty's Minister Tehran have csked for the release of Colonel Summerhayes at present Political Officer and Consul at Aleppo, He is clearly well qualified for this work and is best choice available in the Middle last, 3, I understand that His Majesty’s Minister Beirut does not want to lose Colonel Summerhayes but would be prepared to release him provided satisfactory replacement could be provided without long delay, 4, ^ I am^anxious to [? grp. omitted ? assist] Commander-in- Chief in this matter which is of real importance and I should be grateful for your assistance in finding replacement of Summerhayes, I am repeating this telegram to Spears who will no doubt give you any further details you may need of qualifications required for the ^leppo post. ^ career Consul of fairly long seniority will clearly be needed though perhaps, it might be possible for the political side of Colonel Summerhayes 1 work to be taken over by Colonel Stirling who also has his headquarters at i.leppo, 5, I should be grateful for early reply.

My telegram No.853 of December 13th (not repeated). I fully agree that, before allowing Shahbakhti to take up any appointment as G.O.C. Shiraz and Isfahan, we should have to come to an understanding with him. Allied victories should have cooled any enthusiasm he ever had for the other side, while uhe prospect of power and of perquisites should make it unnecessary for us to oifer financial inducement, though this should not be ruled out here. ¥e have been through the evidence again, and it appears to us that^there is not much to choose between + Shahbakhti and Firouz from the point of view of pluck, while in ShahbakEIdT^there are several factors: 4 The Shah and the Prime Minister are both inclined to appoint 2) The Prime Minister says that he wishes to withdraw Firouz as week and inactive. ^ him^ ^ as ^ ar mor e courage, ability and strength under A&gt;- 1 ^suggest that, even if we wish to adopt a policy of co operation with ^ the tribes, it is better to have a determined man like Shahbakhti in the background rather than Firouz who is for conciliation mainly because he is afraid to show a bold front. x? no ^ the Shah and the Prime Minister have thought the matter out, but there are indications that the Prime Minister takes it for granted that there would be civil Governor- General in Isfahan (there is no talk of removal of the present ' man; and in Shiraz. f/e consider, however, that it would be best that we should decide what would be best for that area, and induce the Persian Government to carry it out. After full , discussion, we consider the following scheme likely to yield best results: a) Isfahan. Present Governor General to remain. Question of suitable G.O.C. for Isfahan is under consideration. Military Governor torbe appointed for Bakhtiari country (our Military Attaches consider • • • •11 . &lt; i 2. • . ’ .. r t consider that they'could find one of several good Lieutenant- Colonels for this post)...to reside at Chaitar Mahal or Feridan. The two Bakhtiari nominees of Zahidi must he removed in ny C&amp;S 6• / h) Shahhakhti to he Civil Governor-General of Shira^ province and G.O.C. for that province and down toBushire. Military command of that area vrould not be sufficient fo^ him. Moreover it is probable that the civil administration 1 &lt; sublet to his influence in any case, and for this reason and also because in tribal areas it is difficulttoseparate civil^ and military responsibilities it is best that Shahbak discharge both functions. 5 In view of the arguments set forth above, I trust that you will agree to our sounding Shahbakhti and the Prime Mims e forthwith.

(b) patrolling of the roads by us with few armoured cars. (c) close co-operation by us with Persian army and gendarmerie to whom minimum amount of currency might be allocated on condition that American and British officers should be attached to the Persian military headquarters at Shiraz and Isfahan to ensure proper use of such material. (d) employment of a few aircraft for patrol work in co-opera tion with Persian air force,Although I fully realise that you are anxious to avoid providing the British forces for these protective duties, their numbers would be small and I feel convinced that without employment or show of some degree of force - it will be quite impossible to obtain the best result from Persian army and from gendarmerie or to over-awe potential raiders, I am unable to agree that it would be in our interests to try to win over such a notorious anti-British intriguer as Nasir. Such a step would run counter to our whole policy of supporting the Government against^he tribes and we should only be bolstering his position which has^consider&amp;bly weakened^the [grp. undec. ?strength] of the tribes by recent events.

The impression X derive from this letter is that whoever was in charge at the secret landing ground, (a*** yogp tfriep-rvy* to* 140 of November 9th), gave the show away by displaying to a British plane a signal agreed with the Gerraans (or with the Persians) and that HA32R viA3HGAX has sou^t to explain away the display of this signal. 3. It so happened that I received this letter a few minutes before the Governor-General arrived yesterday evening to see me on a pro-arraoged visit to discuss certain military plans for th* contemplated occupation by military forces of Qashgai territory. This gave me an opportunity to ask what Nasir was doing at the moment and he laughed and said he had had a letter from him which he showed me. As this was more or less identical with the one I had received I shov/ed my letter to him. FIRONZ’s overt reaction was '/anyway, what has it got to do with ZfASttt'* he. also asked if the plane woo ours. To this I replied that the flight a month ago was by our machines but as yet I had no information about this particular plane - plough I imagined it might well have been ours If it was not a Persian machine. 4. In connexion with his railitary plans, referred to in &gt;areu 3 above, I asked about the possibilities of his having air ce-oueration from the Persian Air Force in ISFAHAN. This gave me an opportunity, which I used with great discretion, of extracting from him a statement (twice repeated) to the effect that he knew of no aerodrome or prepared landing ground anywhere in the 4oshgai country.

As I have reported in my telegram an initial contact on October 1 st between Khosrow’s Qaghgai and the troops resulted in a brush in '•iiiAh the tribesmen suffered some small losses. On October 3rd an other attempt was made by Khosrow to pass a detachment at DASHTAK (some 25 miles North, North-East of Ardekan). The tribes again with drew but the detachment went off to cut off this party at another point lurther .est, Uansurabad, and were here caught by a larger body of .ashgai• A long fight ensued lasting five hours when the soldiers 1 ammunition ran out. They had suffered some casualties, including an ■ ! ,0.0. killed and the officer wounded. The troops had to surrender ^ and were disarmed, losing sixty rifl es sn d three machine-guns. 4. Later on, either that night or the next day, the story is that a larger force of troops engaged the tribesmen and inflicted heavy casualties. The exact venue of this fight is not clear but it is' thought to have been somewhere in the same neighbourhood. 5. I regret that it is not possible to report with more accuracy or detail but the information at the disposal of the authorities'is meagre and I cannot even say whether the above reports bear any re lation to the truth.

Tien I arrived at Ibrahimabad I received an invitation to lunch from TTasir Khan who was camped at Qargun about 7 miles away. Colonel Mejlisi who was commanding the troops in the Beza and Eam- firuz districts accompanied me. Nasir Khan informed me that he was on his way to Piruzabad but on faring that I was touring the Beza district he decifed to remain camp-d at argun until he could see me, as he had matters of im portance to discuss with me. I informed him at once that I held no official position in Iran and was only acting for the Iranian G-overn— ment and the British Legation in an advisory capacity in connexion with, the collection of grain for the deficit areas of the Pars Province, studying the condition of the crops and making suggestions for the improvement of irrigation. But that I wis glad to meet him and renew acquaintance with the Qashgai tribes whom I had met 21 years ago in very friendly circumstances and who had always been very hospitable to me. These were pleasant memories which had re mained with me during my long absence from Iran, Nasir Khan replied that he regretted that he was not in a position to entertain me at his present camp but would be very glad if I visited him at Piruz abad where he and his tribe would welcome me and where I would get an opportunity of seeing the Qashgais in their own country and be able to study the condition of the people, the crops and the irri gation and get whatever statistics I required about the grain. Be sides he had many things to tell me and the present time was too short. He would leave for Piruzabad the next morning and hoped to arrive there in about ten or twelve days. After he had made all arrangements for my visit he would send me a letter of invitation by his son who would accompany me on my tour. He would be glad, how ever, if Prince Firuz would arrange to have me escorted as far as the „ashgai border and from there I would be escorted by his own men. I thanked him for his kind invitation and said it would be a pleasure to meet him at Piruzabad in the near future. When we were walking from one tent to another where the lunch was spread, Nasir Khan whispered to me that he would like to talk to me privately, for, a few minutes. After kunch he took me aside and told me how mucn A his family had suffered at the hands of the ex- Shah Reza Khan and in consequence how much he distrusted the Iranian G-overnment. He was willing, however, to offer his services to them if he could be assured of his safety and the safety of his family. He has always been very loyal to the British and hibped soon to be „ ,\ ahle t0 &amp; ive further proof of his loyalty. He stressed this several 0.4 times through the conversation as if. he knew of some plot against * id ' the British and wished to warn me of it. Here is a resumd of his ' story:- Eleven years ago the ex-Shah Reza Khan sent for him and in the presence of G-eneral Darghai and General Alborze accused him of secretly treating with the British Government with the object of de posing Reza Khan and becoming Shah himself. For this reason he was imprisoned for three to four months. Mr. Harvard of His Ma esty ! 8 Legation could vouch for this. During this time a Captain Abbas Khan was appointed Governor of the Qashgais but his ill-treatment of the tribe, especially the women, ma^e him extremely unpopular and led to rebellion. The Government sent 15,000 troops to quell it but they were defeated and Reza Khan was compelled to send his father on a Mission to pacify the Qashgais. The Mission was successful and the tribes quietened but soon after this the Boir A&amp;medies and the Mamas- sanies rebelled and Nasir Khan was sent to assist General Shebani and Sardar Bakhtiari, Minister of War. After six months of hard fighting in which Kasir Khan received a slight wound in the shoulder, the Boir Ahmedies were defeated and came to terms. Later Nasir Khan was ap pointed a Deputy but after one year was dismissed and imprisoned and then released again. While in Tehran he received an invitation r* through Mr.Harvard to attend Lady Clive’s Tea party and because he did so he was again imprisoned for six months and then restricted to Tehran. Mr.Harvard is well aware of this fact. In those days he \ was /■—ppyjji * 0 *—mmmmmmmDrniatmmmmk ^as in close contact with the British Legation. Then the Russians attacked Tehran he was staying in a village oust outside the town and was obliged to seek safety in flight. He went to Ihiraz and there tried to get contact with His Majesty 1 s Consulate. Per his own safety he was compelled to live outside Shiraz. One day he received an invitation from Kis Majesty’s Consul, through Moharamed Bagher Khalili to come to Shiraz. He did so and stayed in the town for 14 days and thecas there was no further invitation to see His Majesty’s Consul he ^turned to the Q.ashgai country. About a year ago the British Consul, with Mr.Napoleon! as interpreter, visited him and advised him to give himself up to the Iranian G-overnment. He replied that he still loved life and had no desire to die. The Iranian G vemrnent had killed his father, imprisoned him several times, and assaulted and abused his mother. How could he have any confidence in them. He told His Majesty's Consul that he was willing to give himself up to the British Officer commanding the troops at Abadan if this was thought necessary but would not submit to the Iranian Government. On one occasion he was asked by the General Officer Commanding Pars, midy, to live in ' iraz. He agreed and renteii the Bagh Khalili as a permanent home but after being in occupation for two days only he was suddenly summoned to accompany Cartip Amidy to Tehran. Realising that some treachery was meant, he took alarm and fled from Shiraz. Though he has distrusted the Iranian Government he has always been a loyal subject and proved it on many occasions. For instance he went to Firuzabad and Karzin and relieved the Iranian troops who had been hemmed in by bandits and were in danger of being wiped out. He escorted them with his own men as far as Kavar. On another occasion the Hangam troops miiiinied and handed all their arms to him. He took these arms and gave them to the Government representative at Kavar. Again he went to the rescue of Colonel Himat and his troops who were completely surrounded by bandits at Lament in the District of Lar. succeeded in driving off the bandits. His expenses in this campaign alone amounted to 40,000 Tomans which he paid from his own private purse. The Government has given nothing in return. Let the Iranian Government show some trust in him as they have lone with other tribes such as the Mamasaani, the Dushmanziari and the Kazermis to whom they have given rifles and he would serve the Govern ment faithfully. He was not asking for many rifles but let them make a public presentation of a few, say ten only, to him, as a token that he and his people were trusted servants of the Government and he in return would offer to k ep secure any special area. At present he was not trusted and held no position so could do nothing. If given an official appointment he would guarantee the security of the area allotted to them and refund all losses that may occur from robberies which at present he was unable to prevent. He promised to return the rifles given to him whenever they were required'. The Government could rely on him as he would never ^reak his promise. If he did, it would disgrace the honour of his family which they valued more than all the riches and powers of the world, and to protect which they would gladly ( suffer death. Government had given many rifles to other' tribes who were using them for robberies. Me sincerely hbped that the Mtish Govern ment did £&gt;t believe that he was pro-G rman. He disliked all Dictators and particularly the ITazi form of Government, If the Germans came into « power neither he nor his tribes would exist, except as slaves. I said that I had heard that' some European, p ssibly German, was in tie Qashgai country and in close touch with him. He replied that this was entirely untrue and that he had been asked about it before and had assured the Iranian authorities that there was no such person or persons with him. I could ascertain this for myself when I visited him at Kamfiruz. He said he had always tried to prove his loyalty to the British and was ready to serve us in any way and at any time but he had made many enemies who were lying about him and trying to cause trouble between him and the British authorities. He hoped that this war would give him an opportunity to prove beyond doubt that he was a faithful ally. He was asking for no reward but hoped that at the end of the war the British Government would remamber his services and recompense him as they thought best. He repeated a warning several times in the course of the conversation that when the Germans arrived at Baku the British Government would know who were and were not friendly to them and he then would be in a position to help them. He more or less implied4 ( that he had inside information of a 'Volte Pace' of the Iranian Government, which would threaten our interests here. He went on to say that he had been infor ed that the Iranian Government con sidered him a potential menace as the tribes wished to unite and appoint him their leader with the object of regaining all they had lost. If this was true the British Government should trust him and would benefit from it, if untrue the Iranian Government had nothing to worry about. has been in contact with Hr.Hoard, Assistant Manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Conrany and also with His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at .uushire. Some time ago he was informed that a Colonel hybus would visit Kazerun and wished to meet him. He immediately marched 28 miles to Fazerun and waited there three days for him. Cn the third day he telephoned to His Majesty’s Consulate Shiraz and was told that Colonel Pybus had not been able tp visit Kazerun and had returned to Tehran. His constant desire to meet British Officers a and be guided by them is assurance enough of his loyalty to them, if he could get some guarantee that he would not be' imprisoned and killed as his father was he would come into Shiraz and go to iehran or elsewhere whenever required. Some days ago he sent his brother Khosrow Khan to call on the Ustandar, Trine© ?iruz, at ,hiraz but while he was on his was a robbery occurred which necessi tated his return. He was now rending his son and if absolutely necessary would come himself provided he got the assurance he had asked for, i.e., the safety aid freedom of himself and his family. ' e knew on good authority that the robbers who had attacked and robbed Captain Wilson were servants of the landowner Hussan Aly ikmat of Shiraz. He was being blamed for manji of the robberies which were occurring daily but which were actually being committed by other tribes. As 1 left his Ganlp he 8aid he like me to meet his brother Khosrow Khan at Kamfiruz and would send him a letter instructing him to call on me. I replied that I would be glad to see him at any f* (Although Khosrow Khan was only a few miles away from my camp at Karafiruz he made no attempt to visit me). • i? 31 * 0831011 Na ®i r Khan whifch I got during the conversation I had with him was that he was prevaricating most of the time. He seemed to be a hunted creature, terribly frightened of being^cartured and probably killed and longing for seme position which would make , him secure and not entail his leaving the tribe. It is very doubt ful that he has much power among the Qashgais and in fact I was told in Baiza and Kamfiruz that he was disliked by tiem because he was le r mg hea/y taxes from them and taking a very large share of what ever had been robbed by them. I could see that there was much that was worrying him and that ne would like to tell me more about himself bu„ was not sure whether the place and time was opportune or that the - ^ ° ® was talking to could be trusted. I feel sure he would be ®? re °P en and f*ranfc if some British officer had closer contact with j him and gained his confidence. In spite of all that is alleged against him I could not help feeling sorry for his predicament. (Sg'•) I.3.R0B3RT, Lieut-Ool Consular Liaison Officer, 20 th Sept amber, 1942./?.

There is poverty and shortage of food, amounting In parts to famine conditions, an inherited aptitude for lawlessness and some traditional hostility to Great Britain among sections of the C.aahgal, of the Luhgalu and aiaong the Lhans of DashiA, Daahtist&amp;n and Tongistan. Disorder, once it began, might spread rapidly and, were the military situation unfavourable to Great Britain, it would not be difficult to incite attacks against British interests# (Communications North and South of Ghiraz might be cut; attacks might be uad© on aerodromes, ou the port of t-uahirc (as in the last war) and on outlying A#I.G.C# workings such as Gach Laran# In certain circumstances as, for instance, the breakdown of the central Govemne.it, troops would desert to, or sell their ainas and ammunition to, the tribes# • It is, however, extremely Lfcsly that either Germans or Persians would be able to bring about any serious concerted action by the tribes# Feuds and jealousies are characteristics of the tribes of Pars, and these influences are nev^r more prominent than when disorder Is prevalent. . 5. as regards the 4 art that light be ployei by the Governor General, referred to In paragraph 1 of the A#L#0*8 appreciation, there are certain general considerations that apply to most Parsldn officials and probably to him also. It may be taken as axiomatic that in present circumstances most Persians of any /IntelligenceInterests of percia f trying to order their lives that they k* on the f irming side* Consequently their attitude will depend &lt;m t teir a preoiation of the j’lilitary situation* If t. v ie Gerraane arrive in Persia* looking liae victors, few Iersians will dare to oe openly on our aide, a znsofeer will be openly on the Gerraan, includinp ofXioere of the Xrniy who aay be expected to assist eleiients likely t )« troublesome to us to get arris* I do not think that t \e Governor General (and G*o.C*) of Fare will be among the latter or thht he will be among the few who will openly side with us* 6 # It is Improbable thut any action we could now take would affect the attitude the persiaaa world adopt in tV;-. event of a German advance into Persia which looked like reeulti in the occupation of any considerable part of the country* ut t xr&lt;; would px*obably be a period when the issue was still undecided, when German subversive activity would be at its height and woen any friends we have among the tribes and elsewhere could be of uae* I Cur ...olicy of non-interference in internal affairs, :f suT.ortlng whatever central Gcvernuent nay be power - unl'ortimatoly ufraa^iy bot corrupt and Inefficient - and of avoiding comroitments to tribes does not, however, encourage riany devoted adhi rents. Altern tive policies have many drawbacks, but could be dlacu^ed when the Army •ionmunder next visits Tehrari, if he so wishes. -s 7 . To revert to Farsi it w^uld probably have an excellent effect if a mechanised column were to move through Isfahan, Abadeh, Bhiras and thence to Firuzabad (Degree f.heet H-39.W). would clear up the reports that an aerodrome is being constructed near Piruzabad and might be able to verify whether there are Gemune with Nasir Qashgai. The objection is that it is just possible, thouph not probable, that there might be some opposition to the column when nearing Firuzabad from hasirvs followcra* It is, I understand, the Army Comander’a policy not to get involved with the tribes* 8* A further memorandum will be seat in reply to paragraph 2 of your letter quoted above regarding potential fifth columnists (bgd) IV* A* Fraser* iiajo r-Gene ral, military Attach^*s R2C0K0 OF 0CirVEH3AT10fl WITH QiiUaHAL FI»U2.

The Prime Minister has invited Tadayyun (M.A. 288, F.O. 207) to join the Cabinet as Minister of Justice in place of Ahi (M.A. 7, F.O. 5), who has been appointed ambassador to Moscow (see Summary No. 25/42, paragraph 6 (i)). He refuses, however, to give up his portfolio. Nor has Tadayyun yet agreed to accept office. A new’ candidate for the premiership has appeared in Bayat (M.A. 65, F.O. 50), the Vice-President of the Majlis, but, as the law stands, no Deputy can become a Cabinet Minister until three months have elapsed since his resignation from Parliament. 2. It is not yet clear whether the Prime Minister, Soheily, will be forced to resign or whether he will attempt to gain a reprieve by changing members of his Cabinet. 3. Anxiety about the wheat situation is increasing and the Government Is inclined to panic. They appealed to His Majesty’s Legation for an import of 10,000 tons of wheat per month for three months to tide them over the crisis created largely by their own vacillation. They have been promised 5,000 tons, as the situation appeared to be critical. But they have been warned that they will get no more. That, however, does not greatly impress the Government, who continue to tell the people that they are confident' that the Allies will implement their promises to give such economic help as is required. 4. As an indication of the weakness of the Government may be cited the shortage of wheat in Ahwaz for daily consumption. The Khuzestan wheat crop is already harvested and the Government stores should be filling up, but a ring of would-be profiteers, headed by the Deputy for Ahwaz, are holding up supplies while pressure is brought on the Government to free the price of wheat from Government control. The Government appears to be unwilling to apply the Anti-Hoarding Law, although there is here a clear case for doing so. There has as yet been no prosecution under that law. Attitude towards the War. 5. The belief grows that the Germans will reach the Caucasus and Persia, the result being a reluctance to be openly identified with a pro-Ally policy, still less with an anti-Axis policy. The tone of the press, however, remains, on the whole, satisfactory. In spite of the experience of other countries, many Persians appear not to fear a German occupation, some to be ready to welcome it. Existing maladministration and anxiety about food supplies incline some people Enclosure. Persian Affairs. Political. Economic.fa 2 ^ ac ^ e P^ ^hc opinion that things could not be much worse under the Germans. ^ ’ i^°^ ever ’ ^ ear Persia becoming a battle-ground. It is hoped that hostilities would be confined to Western Persia, and it is not impossible that in the minds of some Persians, notably some generals, and possibly the Shah, plans are maturing for the eventual establishment of a Government in Isfahan or further East that would come to terms with the Germans. There is, however, as yet litt^ (fe more than surmise to support this theory. A pyointments: Civil. 6. - (i) Zain-ul-Abedin Qiami to be Farmandar of Kazvin. (ii) Nasrullah Mustashiri to be Farmandar of Kermanshah and Deputy Governor-General of the 5th Ustan. (iii) Amir Hikmat to be Director-General of the Medical Department of the Ministry of Health. (iv) Nasrullah Saifpur Fatimi, Head of Shiraz Municipality, to be Farmandar of Shiraz. Note —The officials quoted under (i) and (ii) above are exchanging appointments. Internal Security. Fars. 7. The Qashqai chief, Nasir, and his brother Khosrow have not yet made submission to the Persian Government. Nasir is in the neighbourhood of Firuzabad (Degree sheet H-39.W) with an armed following estimated at several hundred. Frequent unconfirmed reports are received of the presence with him of two or more Germans. He is reported to be apprehensive of an attack by Government troops, but the general officer commanding is also apprehensive of the dangers of such an attack. His brother Khosrow is with part of the tribe in their summer quarters near Samirum (Degree sheet H-39.D-W.5496). in fairly close contact with troops of the Isfahan Brigade. Both sides appear to have agreed to observe an indefinite armistice. 8. Meanwhile, there are reports of an intended or existing combination of these Qashqai chiefs with the rebel chiefs of Kuhgalu, notably Abdullah Boirahmadi and Hussein Quli Mamassani. Such a combination has for some time been reported as the aim of German agents. Abdullah Boirahmadi appears to be trying to get himself recognised as their chief by the several sections of the Boir Ahmadi, who rarely manage to avoid quarrelling with each other for long. 9. Although the only tribe in Fars in active rebellion to the Government is the Boir Ahmadi, the situation is not satisfactory. The Persian Government has not yet dared to attempt to impose its authority over the Qashqai and Kuhgalu tribes, and in large parts of Fars there is no Persian administration. These tribes have never been friendly to Great Britain and they are a potential danger, which is, however, not likely to develop seriously unless the military situation deteriorates considerably. Bakhtiari. 10. The Minister for War has recently visited Isfahan and reports that he considers that the situation in Bakhtiari is satisfactory. Chiefs of the Chahar Lang had come in to Isfahan to assure him of their loyalty to Government. Kurdistan. 11. Hama Rashid has sent his son to General Arfa, commanding Persian troops in Kurdistan. A zerbaijan. 12. The press reports that on the 11th July 100 Kurdish chiefs of Western Azerbaijan had accepted the invitation of the Governor-General to visit him. He addressed them in the presence of the Soviet Consul, reminded them of their duty and exhorted them to be good subjects. The Soviet Consul also advised them to do nothing to disturb the peace. 13. Confidence has not yet been fully restored in Western Azerbaijan. There are still refugees from the towns in the villages, but they are gradually going back.P.ASHQAI TRIBES. The following note on the Qashgai tribes has been compiled from information from various sources, including H.I.6 and A.L.O., Shiraz, none of which is authoritative. It should be read in conjunction with 'A Report on the Tribes of Pars” by Captain Christian, General Staff, published by General Staff India in 1918. This book remains substantially correct as re gards boundaries, lines of migration and summer and winter quarters of sub-tribes (known as 'tirehs'). Migration. During the reign of Reza Shah an attempt was made to settle the tribes, and to prevent the annual migration. This was successful to a limited extent onlv, but it resulted in a considerable decrease in the number oflfeheep, mules and horses. It is probable that the greater number of the so-called settled families have this year joined the migration, which has followed normal lines. On the other hand there are a number of villages in the Qashgai country, which in varying degrees are connected with the tribe. Organisation. 5. The policy of Reza Shah was to break up tribal organ isation and to substitute the authority of Government officials, usually military officers, for that of the tribal chiefs. In pursuance of this the appointments of Ilkhani and Ilbegi were abolished in 1930, Military Governors were appointed to districts in the Qashgai country, but the actual control of the sub-tribes (tirehs; was entrusted to selected members of the chiefs families appointed by Government. The Shah’s policy was to prevent the tirehs from combining. Revenue and Taxation. tribeB no l°nger pay revenue nor do they pay taxes on their sheep, horses and cattle as formerly. Their produce is taxed when brought for sale to the towns. Strength. 5# „ ^ 18 unlikel y that the number of families today exceeds 20,000 true Qashgais. At the usual confutation of 5 heads and one fighting man per family the total number of the tribe does not exceed 100,000, nor 20,000 fighting men. -hit even in the days when the Ilkhani was at his most power ful he never succeeded in collecting more than 5.000 fighting men at one time. o , Fighting Value. , T ^ e outstanding characteristics of the Qashgai used t0 remarkable mobility, both on foot and mounted, in his own difficult country and his good marksmanship at shori ranges iie has been known to attack with dash and courage, but has little stomach for a drawn-out fight. He is essentially a guerilla and even in the days when tribal organisation was at'its most efficient, could never be persuaded to keen the field for long Recent years are unlikely to have i iproved his fighting value. He was well beaten by Reza Shah and oppressed for some years bv chief s. Arms /Arms. 7. Reza 3hah set himself out to disarm the tribes. An unknown number of arms were taken from them, but undoubtedly many were hidden. These have now re-appeared, but are notlikely to be of great value after being buried for ten years, or more. In addition they have during the last twelve months acquired a certain number of modem arms from deserters from the Persian Army. Estimates of arms now in possession of the tribe vary from 2,000 to 5,000. It is reasonable to assume that they have little ammu nition. In certain circumstances they might be supplied, or might supply themselves, with both from Persian Array garrisons in Pars. Attitude of the Tribes towards the Persian government. With the abdication of Reza 8hah in September 1941 Government authority in the tribe broke down and has never been re-established. Government officials left the tribal country and have not returned. The tribes are greatly relieved at their escape from the oppression of recent years and rejoice in the liberty to migrate without having to pay large suras in bribes to military abd gendarmerie officials. They have resumed their tribal dress (forbidden by Reza Shah) and carry arms openly. They ai * e -» COTne into open conflict with Government, but would attempt to unite in opposition if Government were now to attempt to re-institute the old rdgirae of oppression. There is no strong desire for a union of all the sub-tribes again under one Ilkhani. Inter-tribal feuds and jealousies appear to be as strong as ever. Attitude of the Trib es towards the British. f* ^ The Qashgai tribes generally have a tradition of host- Ility towards the British, but even in this the tribe has never been united. The Shishbuluki and sections of the Kashkuli have In the past sided with the British, but that was mainly due to their hostility to Soulat ed Douleh, the anti-British Ilkhani. Good political handling might induce those tribes and some of the Darashuri to side with the ^British again if the counter- attraction was not too great. Details of Sub—Tribes (Tirehs).

H e was kept in prison or under surveillance in Tehran _ until September 1941 when in the disorder created by the Allied invasion of Persia he escaped and returned to the family lands near Piruzabad, which had been confiscated by Reza Shah. There he found some welcome from the Cjashgai, who, though they had no great love for his father, welcomed the son as a fellow-sufferer from Reza Shah. He collected some armed men and, though he has been profuse in expressions of loyalty to the Persian Government and of friendship for the British, he has refused to obey the Government’s orders to come in to Shiraz. He demands that he should be recognised as Ilkhani of the Qashgai. Some of the chiefs of the sub-tribes appear to be supporting him, others to be temporising with him. It is unlikely that he would command much support, if the Government were to take forceful action against him, but the Government does not consider itself strong enough to do so. Nasir must be suspected of being anti-British owing to the tradition in which he was brought up. Moreover two of his brothers were at the beginning of the war in Germany and may still be there. Consequently he is likely to be a ready tool of German agents and is now under suspicion of harbouring Germans. He has no great reputation for courage and is more of a towns man than a tribal leader. ( il} MjLIK M'VNIUR QA^HGAI . He is a brother of (i) above. Was educated at heading Agricultural College and Brasenose; was in Germany at the beginning of the war, may be there now, and is popularly supposed to be returning with the Germans to Persia.

He is on bad terms with Jaafar Quli (xi) below. ( xi) jaufar quli daraohuri. y ( xil 1 pflfg. Joint Kalantars with (fx) above.

Nothing is known of him but his grandfather AhmaeLKhan. a famous old Kalantar of the tribe, supported the BritisliTrflQlS and was always hostile to Saulat ed Douleh. The following chiefs, although now separated from the tribe, might be of interest some day:- ( xlv) ALI KKAK - 3ALAR HI filMAT ■ Douleh. This stormy petrel has A half-brother of Saulat ed Douleh. This stormy petrel has phyed many parts in Qashgai quarrels in the past, sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other. Twenty years ago he was unstable and impetuous, but was useful to the British in 1918. He could %jobably still be relied upon to create a diversion. He has not been allowed in the tribe for some time and is now living in Kerman. (xv) AMIR HUSSEIN KHAN. ( xviij AMiR Q lflu l KHAN, Sons of Sardar Ehtesham, who was hali brother of Saulat ed Douleh and his Inveterate enemy. Sardar Ehtesham was on the British side during the last war. Later Saulat ed Douleh acquired nearly all his property, which is now in the possession of Nasir Qashgai. Little is known of their character, but they would probably be ready to join any movement against Nasir. Their mother was the daughter of Ahmad Khan f an influential Kalantar of the Shishbuluki and the Shishbuluki usually supported their father. They now live in Shiraz.

I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) A. HOLMAN 7. V. hrenan. Esq.. , Hie Majesty*s Consul, SHIRAZ . Ah,No. 187/5/4 &lt;? I had a long discussion about Fare with General FIRUZ, th* Governor General, this morning. I told him my personal ideao about Pars. The primary consi ! 31 afcion was that there should be no question of returning to the old bad situation of a solid Qaahgai block under one leader whether he was cal! d Tikhani or Gove3?nor. I thought such a solution could only be hanaful to both Persian and British interests. To prevent it, it should not be necsssary to embark on operations against the Qashgai tribes. Kis policy should be to maintain direct relations with Kalantars and Kadkhudas, to conciliate them and give their* aoaXldanca* ly reading of the sit t was that the tribes had no desire for a return to the old dayo of subservience to the Ti^dduni family and that only fear ol oppressive action by the Gcvernraent would drive them to unite; I saw no indications that they wanted t enter into a war with the Government, if he could get their confidence I thought there was no rear of their supporting Nasir and that then ITasir was no problem. But sooner or later he would have to convince the tribes that the Government was strong enough to enforce their authority. He should oe able to play his cards so that that could come about without a conflict except with the 3oir Ahmadl. He said that that was exactly his policy. He expanded it at some length, said Xhe was temporising until he had more confidence in his troops. v/a then discueeed Qavam. I said that Qavam hud been very anxious about the situation in Fare where he still had interests and relatives, ^any reports had reached Tehran that it was the policy of FIRUZ to get NABIR officially appointed Plead of ohe Qashgai. Those reports had caused anxiety to and to others as well as QAVAM. OAVAM had never mentioned to me any desire to become Governor-General of F-vR3, but others had suggested that such an appointment would prevent the Qaehgai under NX3IR becoming the pai'amt^unt power inj0iR3. FIHOZ &gt;md seen QA.VAm ami i-iad, he thought, reassured him that his interests would be protected. I was favourably impressed by FIRUZ 1 a apparent frank ness. He went on to tell me about his troops. He admitted to having between 8,000 and 10,000, but said that only 3,500 were effective. He claimed that Dashti had now been satisfactorily settled and that everyone of importance had submitted except ALT ISMAIL. (The latter happens to be the most Important). He was g now going to concentrate forces at ARDAKAN - where he already had a battalion - to overawe the Boir Ahmadls. He had detachments at MIZA (1 squadron) ,FEHLIAN (2 companies) ,A3AI&gt;EH (1 squadron),Di2H3ED (1 or 2 companiec^ The Isfahan division was to post a detachment at SIMARUN. He said that he was quite incapable of moving a force of any size owing to lack of transport. He had no M.T. There were nowadays very few horses or mules to be had in PARS. He painted a terrible picture of the food sitixation in PARS. There was no harvest at all in the QARM3IR. The people were starving already. The crop would not be in in the aASUSIR for 4-6 weeks. He had then no transport to move it. Taking every bit of wheat, maize and barley Into account, PARS would be short of 30,000 tons of wheat before next harvest. Tehran. 4/6/42.

After an opening gambit His Excellency geve me a lengthy ex: os it i or. of the military and other difficulties y/hich confronted him on his arrival in SiuIliZ at the hegiaai^ of April last. Hio effective troops numbered less than 4,000; they were badly officered and Were composed Lq a great extent of partially trained conscripts and of local tribesmen, Qashgai, Boir Ahiaadi, Maraassani, and hhamaeh Arabs. Deserticns were of daily occurrence. 3. Thera was no Rattled Government policy in regard to the tribes and more especially in regard to iJildlvA 1 } KASIR QASH* QAI himself 'tfho had alternately bean wheedled and threatened without any result other than to giv- him quite unnecessary and unjustifiable importance. 4. Before accepting the post of dovernor-Genqrul in PARS he had tacen his beariiigs and had required, and oeon aqcorded by the Priiio Minister discretion as to how ho was to set about his task, but he was given ctahrly to underaband that he could not hope for any military reinforcement from the Ministry of War. He had spoken with the Military Attache at Hts Majesty’s Legation* and had asked for some help tc obtain Borne armoured care and some motor transport vehicles to assist him in his task of restoring and maintaining security on the main road, Which Major-Genaral FRASER had informed him was the principal British concern in this province. FIRTJZ regretted that he had not had that assistance* 6. In regard td&gt; the road therefore he had had to make do, as best he could with the material at hand, though he was grateful for the despatch of a Tehran battalion to replace a local battalion and to stiffen, his local troops. He had set to work to try and improve the morale of this icnnleh and to take certain measures to better the system of Amnieh posts on the road. 0. As for the tribes, and more particularly NASIR KHAN and the question of restoring security in the countryside, he had k had to proceed with extoeme caution. His arrival in SHIRAZ had only preceded by a week or so the beginning of the movement of the various tribes to their suniner quarters. Sir R.W. Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.

In any case Q&amp;VAM was not only out of touch with FARS but he had no influence left in the place to speak of, and moreover his connection with the late Pahlevi ruler had damned him for ever in the eyes of the people here. 13. FIK.U3 went on to say that QAVAM had sent some people tc ^ SHIRAZ and wao encouraging others to send reports to TSHRAN vexaggerating the state of insecurity in the country and the ^ da.r 5 .gerR of tribal troubles. In this he was backed up by certain people v,a,, haf r :aich to lose and nothing to gain by NASII^b continued existence. He mentioned merely as an example the name (which has, I regret, escaped me) of the Persian Director of Publicity in the Tohrc.r. Bi'oadcaftinp station.

He wislaed me to iuxow that this v/as v/hat was happening and he wanted to know whether in fact QAVAM was now being inspired or supported in this move of his by His Majesty’s Legation. If that was Ui fact the case, tJ.cn we had better all have our cards ; a the table. Ke, FIHHZ, had come down here, very much against Ms will, determined to steer a clear course through ail intrigues* tc keep clear from favour ing cither side and to try hud render &amp; service noc only to his own country, which \va;» his prime conce rn, but to the Allies by r restoring peace and security and by i.ai;itaiiiiri^. the road. If, however, ye were at cross purposes, then I had tetter tell him. 15. I* thanked, him for opesking so frankly to me* I was anxious that nc apparent hesitation on uy part in replying should lead him to thin- that there might v e acme basis for his apparent anxiety on this score, so I replied at once to the effect that, while I could not speak officially without consulting you. I wse personally quite convinced that any attempt or suggestion of an attempt on the part of QAVAM UX HULL to undermine lias position here v/ao most certainly not inspired or oncoura&amp;t.l &gt;y His Majesty’s Legation. I told him that I had had occasion to lave a talk with QAVAM on his return from INDIA when I was in THiTRAH last April; that the latter had exx-ressed nervousness and anxiety about the state of affairs in FARS and that he had wondered whether perhaps if he came to FARS in a private capacity he could not be of assistance to the §over3*or-General; I added that for obvious reasons I had not been very encouraging about this. 16. I had regularly reported to you on what I had understood to oe his line of policy here and that, so far as I was able to gauge the position, this policy load scenod to have led to an casing of tension in the minds of moot people here. While I thought JLt possible that in some quarters of the Legation there might be perhaps some anxiety about too much conciliation and concession tc the people of the type of the b^ashgai, I had been given no indication that his tactics were looked upon with undue alarm. I said that I v/ould report fully on what he had been so good as to toll me, and that 1 would let him know In due course your views, if I received them.

The road guards have been with drawn and to all intents and purposes the country is under the control of petty tribal leaders who on occasions are prepared to act together but for the most part rob where they can and as best they can. Laci: of security in this region appears to be due more to the fact that a favourable opportunity has presented itself for robbery and looting rather than to political reasons though the tribal leaders are known to be in touch with the Dashti chiefs Ali Ismail and Rais Grhulam Raimi as also with Naair Khan son of Saulat ud Dowlah who v&lt;ias recently released from political detention in Tehran* The following is a list of the more important chiefs in this area together with a rough estimate of the armed follow ers they can command. Ismail Abbas about 80 rifies. Abdullah 2ar Eusaein about 30—100 rifles. Kumal about 25 rifles. Shahxiya about 25 rifles. Bu Hindi Abdullah about 40 rifles. Ismail Abbas and Abdullah Zar Hussein are at the moment (28th November) surrounding the Military Governor of Lar at a village called Lamard. They have a combined following of about 250 armed men. It is believed that the military garrison at Shiraz has sent a detachment of troops to Lar to secure the release of the Military Governor* From Asalu to Kangan including Tahiri effective con trol of the coastal area has passed out of the hands of the i Government officials (road guards, Customs officials, etc.) into '.ue hands of local Sheikhs, who appear to act in a s imilar capacity to that of Khassadars in the N.V.F.p. of India. This area is comparitively secure ana while the Sheikhs doubtless have contact with tribal chiefs in more disturbed areas, forthe time being at any rate, they appear to recognise the author ity of the Goyemraent. Twenty of tne road guarus remain in As-j alu; those in Tahiri ana Kangan have been withdrawn. In all cases the road guards* arms, have been handed over to local Shaikhs as follows. Asalus Shaikh Abdur Rasool, 2.5 rifles. Tahirii Shaikh Nasir, 25 rifles. Kangani Sheikh Suleiman, 25 rifles. Gelladars Ali Akhbar Khan, 25 rifles. The Sheikhs of these £our villages have a working agreement to lend support to each othex' in case of any disturbance. Daahti extends along the coast from huiyir to Lavar ana into the hills as far as Khormuj ana Ris. Security in this^ area is bad; disturbances appear to be nainly for political reasons rather than for robbery and loot. All the ro^d guards in this area have been withdrawn except in Khorrmij where there are reported to be a total of about 100 road guards and sold iers. It is believed tnat in the event of operations by the Government against/tribes in this area all the minor tribal leaders would combine under the leadership of either Rais Ghu- lam Raxrai, or Ali Ismail. All tola they coula probably muster 900 — 1000 armed men. The following are the principal tribal chiefs together! with an estimate of tnoir armed followers. Rais Ghulam Ra^mi Ali Ismail KaJ i Ghularn Fuladi Klialu Hussain Dorab Khan Ibrahim Khan Abdullah Khan Haidar Maidar 120 rifles. 200 rifles. 30 rifles. 30 rifles. 50 rifles. 60 rifles. 30 rifles. 70 rifles.

It is possible that Nasir Khan would lend assistance to Dashti tribes in the event of the Iranian Government undertaking serious operations against the latter. A factor oi great importance to the tribes in the event of such operations would be the supply of ammunition which mainly comes from the Arab side. Present stocks are not abundant® Taiig is tan. Lavar was recently looted by Haidar Maidar who is reported to have obtained at least 45 rifles from road guards stationed there. Since this attack all road guards from Lavar to Dilwar have been withdrawn to Bushire* Information about arms and ammunition in this area is not obtainable; stocks are however believed to be small* It is be-tievea that the tribes in these areas would assist the Dashti tribes in the event of Government operations.— His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London.

Road guards he has despatched have not reached Ganowah as there has been heavy rain and roads ars bad. In any case road guard have made themselves so unpopular that they are more likely to excite than &lt;iuell disturbance. He states that if troops are despatched insurgents will probably disperse as soon as troops reach Borazjun and that a small aerial reconnaissance would at once cause them to scatter at any rate for time being* If no action is taken and they obtain successes Bushire itself will eventually be in danger. I strongly recommend earliest possible reconnaissanc&lt; by three or four aircraft over Hi sar and neighbourhood com bined with despatch of troops from Shiraz. 4 .

Sir f I have tiie honour to inform you that since the end of the swumer a number of high officials in ^ars t including the Oovernor-General and the General Officer Commanding, have been dismissed from their posts# The late Governor- General, Abul Fath Dowlatsh&amp;hi, is a OnJar prince who probably owed his appointment to his relationshipto the seoond Pahlevi t;ueen. He is a gambler and spendthrift, and went to shiraa in 1936 loaded wit i debt. During his eighteen months in F&amp;ra he did little but make money as fast as he could# In collusion with the General Officer Commanding, General iandieh, he took seven hundred rials per family from the tribes of Fars, who were then allowed to migrate as usual, while reports were sent to Tehran that they had all been settled in houses# In the month of August alone the Governor-General was said to have received 60,000 rials from the butchers of Shiraz in return for permission to increase the price of meat# At the end of august he was hurriedly summoned to Tehran, where he is believed to have been put under arrest. The house which he ooounied at Shiraz was seized seized by the police, but was later returned to its owner, who refused to lease it any longer to the Govemorate- General. . few weeks before M# Dowlatshahl f s fall r. Ali Asgha r ioheily, brother of the Iranian Kinister in London, / had The Right Honourable Anthony Aden, M.C., F.P., etc., etc., etc.had been dismissed from his post of read of the ! unioipality of Shiraz* There seeis no doubt that he had denanded and received bribes from every quarter. He left the Municipality in debt to the extent of rials 700,000, mostly advances from the National Ban3c made for works which he had failed to carry out* bcoept for a series of demolitions, inolut ing that of the arueient Kovan Gate and of part of the magnificent bazaar of Kerim Ilian Sand, there is nothing to show for his tenure of his post* In October M. Soheily was sent back to Shiraz under arrest for the investigation of various charges against him* In September three officials responsible for the administration and settleraent of the Qashgai and Khamseh tribes were also dismissed and sent to Tehran. They ere said to have sent reports to Tehran stating that a large number of houses had been built for the tribes. A general sent from Tehran to inspect the district found that their reports were untrue and that no account oould be given of a sum of a million rials allotted for tribal settlement* 2* rt b oe admit feed that the bribery and corruption which has been rampant in ?ars is, though on an unusually large scale, no means exceptional in the Iran of today. Observers who ha ve known this country for many years and since long before the Pahlevi regime, say that they have never known corruption to be as widespread as it now is. The growing interference of the State in every aspect of life gives loc al officials, and especially the Police, unlimited opportunities of graft* /it the same time the salaries of Iranian officials are small, while the social changes of the recent years oblige them to adopt a far higher standard of living than was formerly recaired of them. Often they can have no alternative but to make an illicit income while they3 A oorloua and interesting appointment has now been made to the Govemorate-Qeneral in Fare. The new Governor- General is )'• Fuhammad Ibrahim Alam $ who will be more familiar mider his former title of ShauJcat ul Hulk (Person alities in Iran No«189). He v/as of course formerly hereditary Amir of Kain, and a great landlord in Seistan and the Kainat. For some time he had been closely attached to the Shah in Tehran, and like the Qjawam, hao been a member of his suite on recent tours. His appointment to Fars was a complete surprise to him. He had been appointed Govemor- General of Kerman and had already sent all his furniture and possessions there. But when he called on the £hah to take leave, he was told to proceed immediately to ars. hen Hr. atkinson oalled on him in Shiraz, Shaukat ul Ifulk confessed that he was completely bewildered. He said he knew nothing of Fare ana had never been a Govexuior under the present regime. He hoped that his aopointrent would be merely temporary. But he made no secret of his fears that his appointment was really a banishment that would lead to disgrace and ruin, in a nticipation of which he had sent all his family to his properties in East Iran. It is signifi cant that the Shaukat, who has always been markedly pro- British and was a great friend in particular of Colonel Taly, disclaimed all knowledge of English, which he is believed formerly to have spoken fluently. He is not likely to run the risk of a charge of being pro-Britiiih in his work in Ears. Mr. .atkinson anticipates that he will be little but a figurehead, and that he will not be able to impose his will on the Police or Jmnioipality or Revenue Office and still less on the local Array Command. The circumstances of his / appointment4. appointment will probably make him only too anxioue to avoid bein^ dragged into prominence in any way, and it ie hardly to be hopea that he will eaooeed in improving or cleaning up the administration of Fara. But the experiment of appointing to a Governorate-General a great hereditary la ndowner is an interesting one, and developments in Fare will be watched with interest.

The report is baaed upon the ninthly diaries of this Consulate and upon other reports submitted by ray predecessors at this post and is prepared annually at the request of the political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3. The summary contains sections on agriculture and on economic affairs, and it covers much of the ground suggested for further survey in your circular despatch No. 6 of 16th January (119/1/37). It is unlikely that rsora material will come to hand for another report before I go to Isfahan, as I am proposing to do soon after the Vo Nous.

Tribal disturbances of former years have led to dlafavour in the eyes of Oovernwent and/and consequent lack of attention and support. 3. The risit of Hie Majesty the Shah to Shiraz, accompanied by the Valiahd was awaited from the su imer up to the end of the year without great enthusiasn. The Army practised organised cheering in order that a suitably spontaneous welcome might be given to him. The .funicipal authorities at one time showed feverish activity in the preparation of roads and beautification of the approaches to the town, but it was given out that no money was to be spent on decoration, doubtless to the great relief of shopkeepers and others on the route. 4. As the Government enters more and more deeply into the everyday life of the people, the protection afforded from the attentions of former Governors or tribal leaders is outweighed by the nuisance of restrictions. The Shah is probably held responsible for this and is feared accordingly, while respect due for his organising ability has been largely lost as it is felt that all the wealth of the country is being attracted to the Capital. The policy of industrial development is, however, realised to be of advantage to the Province of Fare which now has a lucrative outlet for production of cotton for the spinning mills of Isfahan and Shiraz and of beet for the sugar factory situated 25 miles to the north of Shiraz, which is producing supplies for local use. 5. The Qawam-ul-Mulk*s son married the Shah's younger daughter during the year. Though some of Qawam's supporters hope for some advantage from the union, it is regarded as an indication of Imperial designs on property in Fare. 6. The principal Provincial officials at present have connections in the highest quarters and little local sympathy. A new Governor General arrived early in the year/hH ll i ye*r f who in related to one of the Bhah’o w1y« 6. lii« ooualii is In charge of the Finance epertment• The Director of the i unloipolity 1 h e brother of one of the hlgheet effleiele in the Minietry for Foreign affairs.

Hone of these officials has my personal Interest In Shlras or in the Province. 7. Foreign reeldents are^-ill apt to he treated with suspieion by local officials, th ugh an outward semblance of friendship is maintained. But officials in general and notables, sre prohibited from dealings with the Consulata. Jio incidents have occurred during the year in which foreign subjects were involved. 8. The attempt at westernisation of the country has proceeded vigorously in Uiirax. Following on the Imposition of European dreaa on dwellers in town and village, the unveiling of worsen has been aocotapllshed simo&amp;t universally and with surprising absence of disturbance. The *’ahuddur ,f la practically never seen in the streets of i hires now. Uhxxeh women as object, ao&amp;tly of the older generation, keep to their houses. ^ny opposition which there rnay have been seems to have died down. iarly in the year receptions were given at which officials and members of guilds and trades paraded with their wives. ublie baths and conveyances were closed to veiled women, but the example set by the womenfolk of the large garrison did much to effect the change amongst the civilian population. 9. There are still a good many mullahs to be seen about in turban and abba but the nuafeer has b*cn reduced. Their influence and prestige seems for the present to hava disappeared wit the transfer of wany of their funetlone to other administrative departments and the prohibition of public fcligioua/« * &gt; r«llgl&lt;me ob^rr^oem such A* mhmvr* * proeeat ion» And public ?f*y****•• 10. fhA dttention of the younger gencrAtio© Iuia b a»i turned to atbleticfi, fo tball And other eatdoor ga?«ee. t ^oy i^cout troop, TOO strong* hae been organised in bmrss nhich reoelTtd the visit of oolleagues fro?« XsfAhsn towards the alose of the year.

SO. The Municipality all through the year has been under the direction of Aqa Boheily, brother of a high official in the Mini©try for Foreign Affair© who has been mentioned as a possible future Iranian Minister in London. He appears to share the unpopularity of the Governor General and for similar reasons. His dealing© with the public leave much to be desired. The year 19$8 ©aw a large slice cut through the middle of the 3a«ar--i^akil as part of the scheme for carrying the Khiaban-i-Zand through from nort i to south of the town. After much demolition work was stopped for laek of further funds* so a large part of the Bazaar remain© in ruins and la a collecttig place for water and malarial mosquitos. The Khlaban has also been continued for some Mies south of the town &lt;nd several houses built, mostly for the use of military and civil oifioials. This is said to be the beginning of a through road to Ahwaz. ''hm road from Isfahan has been widened at the entr .nee to Shiraz (to the/the discomfiture of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which has had to modify its plans for erecting a new depot by 'arrangement' with the Director of the Municipality after prolonged negotiations), and the old Quran Gate, which was alleged to impede traffic, has been removed by dynamite, for it waa found impracticable to transfer it piecemeal to another site, as had been intended. As the traffic is in any event stopped by the Police close to the site of the Gate, it is not appreciated why its removal was necessary. Its main crime seems to have been its antiquity. The thousand-year old quran which it housed has been placed in the local Museum. An ornamental almond and fruit garden has been laid out near the site of the Gate. The Imperial Bank of Iran has had to postpone the erection of a new building as land bought for the purpose has been cut in two by the municipal road-making schemes. PO• ihe road to t;ie Tomb of Flaflz has been remade and work is in progress on a road to the Tomb of Sa’adi. The reconstruction of the entire enclosure of the Tomb of Hafiz has been commenced and the Education Department is building an expensive granite monument with a gallery of twenty columns. A large cemetery in the same neighbourhood is being laid out as a public garden, the headstones being used for making terraces. 21. A site has been purchased in the town for a new Municipal Hospital. An Orphanage, arrangements for which were made by the late Governor General, was opened during the year by the Municipality. Beggar* are again on the increase# 22. The Chief of the Provincial Police was dismissed in the summer for corrupt practices along with the Chief of the Town Police# Hie successor died shortly after nig arrival. The present Chief of Police is a courteous ana Pleasant/is double that on other roads in Iran. ' he road was inspected early in the year by the director of the Road Depart lent of the Ministry of Co ''!ainioatlons. £6. The . ostal Services continued to function slowly but reasonably surely. An offlee was opened at Takht-i-Jamshld (pereepolie) in the summer. The long talked of airmail service fro n Tehran ee^ma to have been postponed indefinitely and the existing aerodrome after a considerable sum of money had been spent on its improvement w^s decided by a joint conmietion of military officers and officials from the Ministry of iPosts and Telegraphs to be unsuitable. Military opinion wae against its use for any purpose in co-operation with civil authority. Telegraph services are reported to be very inadequate, largely through lack of staff. 87. The Agricultural Department is now largely concerned with the operations of the new aovernment Companies for trade in cotton, akina, wheat, dried fruits, etc. The opium crop having been unsatisfactory and Govern’.nent having decided to limit production, large areas have been planted with cotton and wheat. The total area under cultivation in 1 ars la said, to be about 800,000 hectares. Last year's mop of cotton amounted to 5 million kilogrammes, while 500,000 kilos of opium were produced. Oovemment buyers did not take the whole stock of opium, but cotton found a ready market for the mills of lafahan and Chira*. Supplies of cotton for £ us ala are also required, as commitment© have not been fulfilled. Increased quantities have been planted in the Kaserun and Abadeh areas. Cotton ginning plant has been installed et Kaserun and kamessani, and la on order for Shiraa, ^badeh, Pass and Jehrum. 28. The Government Grain purchasing organisation bought supplies in the Frovlnce and it is said that it is to besold fcaefc to buyere for private use at a lower price in order to assist in recovery from the dislocation consequent on the huge loss of revenue from opium* Temporary grain stores holding 120 # 000 kharvars (about 34,000 tons) have been erected. They are believed to be half full* A credit of 1,300,000 rials is reported to be available for the construction of Grain Silos by Russian engineers, as in other parts of the country. 29. Rice growing has been prohibited in the district and attempt made with small success to grow cotton instead. 30. Sufficient beetroot was produced locally to supply the want of the refinery at Merv Dasht which started work in October. By the end of the year excellent sugar was on the market at a price slightly lower than imported Russian sugar. There was talk of erecting a second factory at Pasa. 31. Fruit trees in parts of the Province were reported in the Spring to be suffering from blight. Unusually cold weather was experienced early in December which will probably have affected the crop of oranges and citrous fruit. 32. Government experts have reported favourably on projects for sinking artasian wells in connection with irrigation schemes. 3o far nothing has been done. 33. At the end of the year a system of sanitary inspection of animals was approved for the whole of Iran. Cattle disease is very prevalent in Pars. 34. There ie nothing to report regarding judicial affairs, the Census Department, nor the Registration Department. The Education Department has been busy under the direction of an ex-Army Officer. The Shahpur Boys’ High School has bean extended and a new school opened at Kazerun. A School of Arts and Crafts with two German instructors were also started in Shiraz. Night classes for adults and weekly lectures have been instituted. On the whole there isa batter etandard of teachers to-day and pay has laprorea.

In October the whole garrison was inspected by Sar i,aahkar Murtesa Yaadan paneh. At the end of the year the General twice had to go to Lar in connection vith trouble between the Amnieh and local tribes* He le an energetic and efficient officer. 36. a he Amnieh have also bet-n increased In numbers and new posts opened. They were inspected in the summer by Sartip G'ulaa All &amp;and, officer in Command of goad Guards for Iran, who included the Gulf Ports in his itinerary, on the whole the force appears to be efficient and discipline is maintained, though there were various rumoured irregularities in the Lar district at the end of the year *hen an officer and several man were arrested for contraband operations. 3 Unrest in Laris tan and amongist tne Boir Ahmedi tribee has necissitated visits by the General Officer in Command of the ^ara Division and of the Officer in Comitaad of Amnieh.

Building continues si Tul-i-nhosrau, but it *i U be difficultto persuade the Kuhgilu tribesmen to settle there in any numbers* Kconoiaic affaire . 58* The merchant class in general is dissatisfied with restrictions on trade and the intervention of Government as a trader. This particularly affects the export trade of Fare, which is passing into the hands of various Companies Aioh monopolise trade. J&amp;xchange Control also has come into force under which the official buying rate for sterling was fixed at 80 rials to the £ and purchase of foreign currency could only be effected by Banks on behalf of the Exchange Control Commission in Tehran, while sales were only under Government penal a issued by the Commission after long delays. This has had detrimental effect on the foreign exchange turnover of Banks and it has seriously effected all import business. 39. Cilver coinage has been out of circulation for most of the year# Owing to the restriction on foreign trade. Banks report that current account deposits have increased consider ably. Some of the surplus has been Invested in trading companies and industrial enterprises. 40. No new taxes have been introduced during the year, but a new Custom's Tariff contained several increases including chargee on motor vehicles, import and working of which has become a Government monopoly. This has not reduced the cost of services to the public, while both new and second-hand cars have increased in price. 41. piece goods, sugar and tea continue to be the principal imports. They are all handled by monopoly organisations controlled by the Government, in which local merchants have little share. Retailers of piece goods expect shortly to be put out of business by the opening of shops by the cotton piece/ ipiece Goods Monopoly Company. 42. Export of opium has been considerably restricted* Carpets were shipped freely by merchants until the end of the year when all transactions became a monopoly of the Carpet Monopoly Company. Gum tragacanth* almonds and dried fruits have also become the objects of monopolies during the year given to Central Companies in Tehran. Agricultural products in general are now controlled by interests centred in the Capital and most of the profits go there. 43. The following Companies have been reported to have been formed during the last two years to handle commodities of interest to the Shiraa traders- Sherket-i-Tijarati (General import and export) Sherket-i-Sheker wa Qand (sugar and match import and trade, with a subsidiary organisation to handle tea, which is not yet in working order). Sherket-i-Panbeh (growing and export of cotton) Tasbit-i-Ohalleh (wheat growing and purchase; Sherket-i-Ketirah (export of gum tragacanth and gum arable) Sherket-i-Khoshkbar (export of dried fruits, almonds etc. Sherket-i-Khollar (wine making and trade) Sherket-i-Ghali (carpet trade) Sherket-i-Eaderat-i-Fars wa Banader (production and sale of native crafts, silver, enamel, mosaic work and hosiery). 44. Most of the principal articles of trade are thus covered by these Companies. They are not well managed. Directors and Managers are permitted to engage in private trade. They are inclined to behave as though they were above the Law and injured parties do not dare to take the matter Eherket-i-Pust Narm(export of skins) 3herket-i-Qumash(Import and trade in cotton piece goods) to/to th» Courts* Largo profits are ad&amp;ittsd to bs aada by buying Iki ported goods rtnd holding thsa off the aarast* This sssas a curious way of spending the tax-payers sonsy which goes to finance such concern*.

Industrial development in f hiras and tr e Province of /ai s has already been mentioned. The Cotton ; pinning Mill at i&gt;hlras» owned by the Far* Lanufscturlng Company, has given very aatisfaotory results. A dividend of @6 was paid on the year's working. Three shifts of operativsa, each of 800, are working day and night. Had^i Mohammed Hassan Behbehani, the Managing ^iractor, vlxlted Tehran during the ruaaer and obtained a Oovernaent pwrait for extension of the premises* Hie buildings have since been erected and it is intended to increase the plant to 10,000 spindles. The neoessary exchange permit hat been protiaed by the Ministry of nnanee and the order for .pinning machinery is probably to go to Platt brothers, of cldhaia, who supplied the existing plant, and for diesel engine* and electrical plant to Lirrleoe sad the General Xleotris Uompany. But some difficulty has arisen over the actual issue of the permits and the aaohlnery cannot for the present be shipped. 46* Curing the year tne same company imported German machinery which has ba**:* sold to the ; hahrl&amp;a Co&amp;paay of lefahan. 47.

Owing to Court Mourning no official celebration took place on the Birth-day of His Majesty king Edward VIII. News of the abdication of ling Edwara in ^eceaber waa reported without cemaent in the local press* The flag waa flown on December 14 on the occasion of the Birthday of His Majesty King George VI. 52. During 1936, the Officiating Political teeident in the Persian Gulf, the Secretary to the? iolitical i eeident, and the kesldeney Burgeon visited bhlras on recess. Mr. Butler/Butler end Mr. Kellljr, of Hie Majesty** Legation at Tehran, also visited persepolls and Bhiraa. Hie Majesty's Consul at Merman alao passed through Shiraz. Mr. arell and Mr. Kobert Cecil, robationcr Vice- Consuls, arrived at ?hlraz on Meoesibei* SI to be attached to Mis Majesty’* Consulate as language students. Mr. ¥.H.Young left for Tehran a few days later. 54. other British visitors during the year included Brigadier General i ricMett, Lerd Alington, the Senior Maval Officer in the lerslan Gulf, the Tehran and lafa an Managers for the Anglo-lranian Oil Co., and various geologists, together with Mr. Schofield gi Industrialisation expert, who was touring Iran under the saspioe* tne oil Company, members of th^ Church Missionary Society, and a arohaeiloglst and an Indian professor. And a large party of students from London oaaped in the Coneulate gardean in September, as they were unable to appreciate the accommodation provided for them elsewhere by the local authorities w;i© otherwise did all tnat could be desired to render their visit profitable and to facilitate their departure. A party of photographers employed by the Anglo-Iraniaa Oil Co. visited lersepolia and the bugar gdbry in December and was endeavouring to find caeels and lorries in close Juxtaposition in accordance with modern ideas of advert!eeis^nt, and to satisfy certain recent dice regulations. 65. In addition to the above activities, the onglo- Iranian oil Company sent a large geological expedition to maAe a eumsy of the whole area between &amp;hlraz and Bandar- Abbas and of the rdakan area in the we«5t of the i rovines with a view to dettraining whether any portion of gars is to be Included in the final concession area.

After the British community, the German colony is the most important in Shiraz. Thera are two families established for many yeara, one of whom owns a flour mill. The other one was formerly land agent to the ^awam-ul-ilulk. A German is in charge of the line Factory control led by the Government and two Germans are employed at the School of Arts and Csafta under the hducation Depart* nt. German mechanics are in charge of machinery at the Pars iSlectric Company's spinning mill. 61. There is an Austrian veterinary surgeon established in ihiraz. 62. An Italian engineer ie employed by the Municipality and by the Cotton Monopoly Company. 66. American archaeologists under Professor Schmidt were at peraepolie in the winter of 1955/36, but work had not been resumed b,? the end of 1956. 64.

The general condition of the province was peaceful during 1934 and the process of breaking-up the tribal organisations continued. The anti-foreign attitude of the authorities was most marked. Paragraph 5 of the report is interesting. Economic conditions continued to be bad owing to the tightness of money, the restrictions on trade and the drain of heavy taxation (paragraph 10). The Shiraz Cotton Spinning Mill with British machinery and equipment/equipment started work in May 1934 under a British manager and the undertaking is proving a great success (paragraph 11). A sugar refinery is also to be established but it is estimated that the cost of locally produced sugar will be 200-300^ greater than the price at which imported sugar can be offered c*i.f* Bushire (para.IB)* The import trade of Shiraz was stagnant owing to restrictions on commerce and the decision of the Government to develop imports via the Bandar-i-Shapur and Mohammerah- Ahwaz routes at the expense of the route via Bushire and Shiraz. As in other districts in South Persia cheap Japanese manufactured goods are driving competitors out of the Market. The export trade in Shiraz lambskins appears to be passing into the hands of the Soviets who sell the higher grade skins as 'Bokhara' or 'Afghan', describing only the lower qualities as Persian i (paras.13-14). Sir Aurel Stein was eventually allowed to complete his archaeological explorations (para.17). Secretary t E. &amp; 0.Department ♦ For information.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a report on conditions in the Province of Ears during the year 1934, prepared by His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, dated the 23rd January, 1935. Tehran, February 11, 1935. Enclosure in No. 1. Summary of Events and Conditions in Ears during the year 1934. (Confidential.) Situation. THE situation has remained undisturbed and progress has continued in the pacification and development of the province. 2. Tribal. With the exception of a few isolated cases of “ brigandage ” by tribesmen in the more remote districts, no further difficulties were experienced after the surrender and removal to the capital of Ali Khan Qashqai last year. An example was given to the tribesmen by executions in Shiraz of a few “ robber ” leaders, and in Tehran, this winter, of some of the minor unruly leaders, mainly from the Mamassani. The disciplinary administration imposed upon the tribes by the military governors appointed by the General Officer Commanding, Ears Brigade, with the extension of the Amnieh stations and blockhouses and the lack of ambition and of . local influence of the young hereditary chieftains, who are also under constant supervision, have contributed to the policy of the breaking-up of the tribes as a unit. The tribal system has been further attacked by the law enacted for the forth coming elections to the Majlis. Under this the special ballot boxes hitherto issued for the tribal vote are done away with and votes are to be recorded at prescribed centres, together with those of the settled inhabitants. It is stated that Government intends, within the next two years, to complete ( the permanent settlement of the tribes in defined areas and to abolish the annual j migrations. An official was at Shiraz during the year to prepare a report on the subject for the Shah. The principal difficulty will lie in the allocation of suitable watering and grazing grounds. The new town of Tal-i- Khosrau, 40 miles to the north-east of Ardekan, has risen as part of this policy. 3. Security. Public security was good, reports of attacks upon lorries on or near the main roads having mostly proved exaggerated. There were a small number of highway robberies in distant districts, in one of which the Director of the Roads Depart ment was robbed of 30,000 rials. 4. Governorate-General. His Excellency Mirza Majid Khan Ahy, who took over the duties of Governor- ' General in September 1933, has shown himself a capable and conciliatory official and has continued to be helpful to His Majesty’s consul. [365 d—3] b1 / ✓ V 2 #- 5. A ttitude to Foreigners. The instructions of the central authorities prohibiting all officials, with the exception of the Chief of Police, from having any relations with foreign repre sentatives, were rigidly observed. The prohibition has been extended to leading notables, merchants and others, some of those who appeared at the consulate on their business being subsequently called upon by the police to explain their visit. | The officials are suffering from spy mania. National sensibility, perhaps intolerance, cultivated by the press of the capital at certain seasons, finds a rich ground in Pars, where British officials have commanded considerable influence in the past, whilst it is difficult for the present generation to forget the formation and maintenance here of the South Persia Rifles. These conditions have led to the otherwise inexplicable treatment of Mr*. Christopher Sykes, who arrived in Shiraz in February on a tour of the province. He was not only refused permission to visit Firuzabad, but requested not to leave the town, being eventually permitted to proceed to Bushire upon the condition that he then quitted the country. The order was subsequently rescinded on official intervention. The Dominican Fathers, the Rev. Dominic Blencowe, O.P., and the Rev. Cyprian Rice, O.P., who arrived at Shiraz in 1933 with the object of founding a Dominican monastery, also came under the ban, owing to their British nationality and to the fact that Father Rice had been a member of His Majesty s consular service. The authorities convinced themselves that Father Rice had served as a subaltern in the South Persia Rifles. These conditions, coupled with the inability of the authorities to understand the work of the fathers and the poor health of Father Blencowe. eventually led to theit withdrawal and the closing down of the monastery. An Armenian priest, educated in Rome, has since been stationed hete, as a successor, by the Apostolic Delegate at Tehran. \ Orders were received by the Judicial Department during the year prohibiting I the use of all foreign words and phrases in legal documents and correspondence. 6. Military. The Fars Brigade is to acquire divisional status by the formation of a third infantry regiment and the increase of the cavalry to regimental strength. Work has been proceeding at the Bagh-i-Takht barracks, to the north of the town, to double the accommodation available for the infantry and artillery. New barracks to house the cavalry regiment are being put up, about 1 mile to the south of the town, on the Bushire road. The construction of aeroplane sheds at the aerodrome is under construction and a French aviation adviser visited Shiraz in J une. The troops at Shiraz are receiving regular training and the appearance of officers and men is good. Sartip Ibrahim Khan Zandieh is General Officer Commanding. 7. Amnieh. The Southern Amnieh (Road Guards) Command in the Province of Fars was abolished in August, when the force in the area became the 8th Shiraz Regiment of Amnieh. The 19th Regiment of Amnieh of Fars was moved to Laristan in March. The discipline and conduct of the road guards has shown improvement, although complaints of the exactions of some of the men in the remoter areas are heard from time to time. 8. Communications. A new road between Shiraz and Tal-i-Khosrau was opened in the early part of the year and repaired after the spring rains. A road from Shiraz to Bandar-i-Lingeh, via Jahrum, Lar and Bastak, was reported to be nearing completion in the late summer. No further progress has been made on the new Shiraz-Firuzabad road, which reaches up to Pol-i-Fasa. The approach to the Qoran Gate entrance of the town (Isfahan-Shiraz road) was widened to permit of two vehicles passing each other.1/ Kr ) A new avenue, to cut through the town of Shiraz from west to east, was begun towards the end of the year. A telegraph instrument was set up at Dehbid in September. The Shiraz-Bushire road was closed to traffic for short periods from January to March owing to heavy rains and snow. Snow on the heights at Dehbid stopped passage on the Shiraz-Isfahan road in February. 9. Irrigation. An attempt was made to increase the water supplies of the town and district of Shiraz, with the expert advice of Dr. Lepmann, a German civil engineer. 1 he latter had not obtained a contract by the end of the year, and resigned. A project to improve irrigation in the Ramjerd area, by the construction or a more solid barrage for the waters of the Band-i-Amir, was being considered. 10. Economic Conditions. The economic condition of the province has been bad owing to the tightness of money, the restrictions upon trade and the drain of taxation, which has proved i a heavy burden upon all classes. . Many merchants attribute this state to the large sums sunk annually in the | armed forces and in the building of the railway, a policy which withdraws a large j part of the liquid assets of the country from circulation, without productive 1 result Conditions locally were further aggravated in the early part of the year by the failure of two of the leading sarraf, on the top of the failure of Seyyed Abdu Rasul Kazaruni. The bazaar was very weak, and several small bankiuptcies followed. The banks were compelled to come to the assistance of other san at to strengthen the market. » A branch of the Agricultural Bank was opened in Shiraz m the month ot May to assist growers. The Agricultural Department took measures to promote the cultivation ot cotton and beetroot. 11. Cotton Spinning Mill. The Shiraz Gotten Spinning Mill of 5,000 spindles, machinery by Platt and Co of Oldham, motor and electrical equipment by the General Fiectnc Company and Metropolitan Vickers (Limited), to which two power engines by Mi relees are to be added shortly, began work in May 1934. under a British mill maI1 M ei Hussein Agar (’Etemad-ul-Tujar), formerly a merchant of Manchester, is the chairman of the board of directors and the moving spirit m the venture. The output of the mill was quickly disposed of for several months m advance. The undertaking has proved so profitable that it is proposed to increase the number of spindles. n i u Full output has been handicapped by the lack of suitable laboui. The construction of a second mill was being seriously considered at the end of the year by the Dehkan Brothers. 12. Sugar Refinery. The promise of Government to endow this province with a sugar factory materialised in the summer, when work upon the buildings started on a site at Marvdasht, near the waters of the Band-i-Amir. on the Shiraz-Persepohs road^ In the autumn it was found that the Agricultural Department was unable to complete the building owing to the incompetence, &amp;c. of the ofhcials and a contract for the work was given to Swedish public works contractors in the CaP The machinery is to be supplied by the Skoda Works, and is due in the spring, via the Caspian. The contract provided for despatch via Bushire but it was found that some of the parts were too heavy and too bulk) foi load transport from^hato^ortis are dependent upon the successful growing of the beetroot in the province, a cultivation upon which there is little practical experience and knowledge at the present. The actual cost of production is/ estimated to be from 200 per cent, to 300 per cent, greater than the pi ice at which| sugar of continental manufacture can be offered c.i.t. Busnire. [365 d—3] B 24 13. Trade. Ihe import trade of Shiraz was stagnant throughout the year owing to the restrictions governing commerce and the fears of the further monopolisation (or the farming-out to groups of merchants in the capital) of the import of other commodities. ihe decision of Government to develop the port of Band-i-Shahpur and the Ahwaz-Mohammerah routes to the north at the expense of the port of Bushire and the route via Shiraz became apparent in the allocation of the customs import quotas, it is realised that if the project can be carried through the port of Bushire will serve solely to feed Shiraz and the district, whilst the Isfahan and other northern markets will be lost. Japanese piece-goods succeeded in wresting the premier position from the Soviets. Merchants have been very dissatisfied with the business methods of both countries in reducing quotations immediately upon the sale of a large consignment. The Japanese manufacturer has secured the market for other commodities. A quotation for the supply of electric light bulbs at 80 per cent, below the price of those of British and continental make was received by the Ears Electric Lighting Company. The export market has seen better conditions with sales of skins and gums. Prices ruling for lambskins in London at the end of the year have made further shipments impossible, but the Russians have continued to purchase steadily throughout the year. Good quantities of gum tragacanth have gone forward to London, American. Russian and other European markets, and Japanese purchases towards the end of the year gave a strong tone to the market. The opium trade was mostly dull, until the syndicate formed in the capital made substantial purchases. The abolition of the “ hazzari ” (monopoly depart ment control of ground under cultivation and estimate of production) and the undertaking by the department to purchase all properly prepared quantities next year have led to increased sowings in the province. Towards the end of the year exports of almonds to India were despatched via Zahedan and the Indian Railways. Arrivals of tea for the Shiraz and Isfahan markets by this route have been reported siace August. The opening up of this route is attributed to the decrease in the railway transport charges. 14. Soviet Activities. The activities of the Soviets in the province during the year appear to have been limited to their trading organisation. Merchants who had been persuaded in the past to subscribe to the Russian Bank and who had tried to obtain a refund of their investment were informed that the application must be made in person in Moscow. The Soviets. Trading Agency continued to make local purchases of all sorts during the year. Merchants claim that the Russian handling of lambskins will lead to the loss of the Shiraz lambskin trade in Europe, as the skins are sorted for resale in Russia and only the lower qualities described as Persian. The higher grades are labelled as Bookhara and Afghan skins. 15. Verdansi Celebrations. The Ferdausi celebrations were held at Shiraz from the 6th to 12th October, when the Governor-General opened a new boys' school and referred to the prospect of the opening of a public library. The funds for these receptions, exhibitions, &amp;e., were obtained by a form of public levy upon merchants, shopkeepers, Government officials, &amp;c., and a house-to-house collection. Several of the official guests to the Tehran-Meshed-Taus celebrations, including Mr. John Drinkwater, passed through Shiraz, after visiting Persepolis, on their return. 16. Surveys. The geological survey by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) of the Shiraz-Jahrum-Niriz-Kazerun areas was completed in the autumn. Dr. K. Washington Gray and his assistants have returned to Abadan.17. Archceological. Sir Aurel Stein, K.C.I.E., who had arrived in November 1933 for an extended , hut rapid exa.mination of prehistoric mounds in the southern and eastern areas of this province, completed his explorations and left for London in May. 1 ermission to visit the Lar and Darab areas was eventually obtained for him j through the Governor-General, who succeeded in persuading the military authorities to withdraw their objections. 1 Difficulties which threatened further work at Persepolis by the present mission under Professor Herzfeld arose during the year between the Persian Government and the representatives of the Oriental Institute of Chicago. Good progress towards a settlement of the points at issue was reported to have been made towards the end of the year, after a division of the finds for which M. Goddard represented the Government. 18. Consulates (British consulate omitted). M. Pierre Tchougounov assumed charge at Shiraz in July as consul-general for the Soviets vice M. Constantin Pletoukhine, vice-consul-in-charge. The latter left for Russia in September. M. Tchougounov proceeded to Isfahan in the autumn to take charge of the 'consulate-general and had not returned to Shiraz by the end of the year. 19. Weather. Total rainfall during 1934: 17-23 inches.

Enclosure in No. 1. Summary of Events and Conditions in Ears during the Year 1933. (Confidential.) THE outstanding feature of the year, from the military point of view, was the continuation and ultimate success of the operations directed against Ali Khan, Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s step-brother, who in the latter half of 1932 had taken up his position in the hills to the south of Firuzabad. In January and February these operations were of an inconclusive and casual nature, and it was reported that Ali Khan was receiving support from a certain section of the Kashgais and from a few Dashtistanis, and was being supplied with arms and ammunition by Arab rebels along the gulf. There followed a lull in which the Government forces vacated Firuzabad and fell back on Jahrum. In April operations were resumed on a more extensive scale, some 2,500 troops under the command of Sartip Ibrahim Khan Zandieh, Officer Commanding the Fars Brigade, advancing from Jahrum on Firuzabad. Ali Khan countered with his usual guerilla tactics, and although reliable information was difficult to obtain, it was generally believed that unless he surrendered, which he had no intention of doing, there was little hope of the campaign being brought to a definite conclusion. In June, however, it became apparent that the end was in sight. Ali Khan was reported to have suddenly disappeared from the fighting zone with a handful of followers, the remainder having surrendered to the Government troops. Early in the following month, suffering no doubt from lack of supporters and shortage of supplies, he accepted an offer of pardon extended to him by the military commander, and was brought to Shiraz on the 18th July and immediately conveyed to Tehran. A report that he had been pardoned and granted a pension has not since been substantiated, and his ultimate fate must remain a matter for speculation. His submission has deprived the tribes-people of a leader who was evidently a first-class fighting man and a clever strategist, and has no doubt been a useful contribution to the Government policy of breaking up the tribes into small and well-behaved sections, lacking in leadership and, in consequence, incapable of concerted action. The triumphal procession of the returning army to Shiraz with an elaborate display of prisoners and captured ammunition was evidently calculated to act as a salutary warning to any others who might be foolish enough to contemplate defying the forces of law and order. The news of Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s death in Tehran in August was, according to all reports, received with indifference by the Kashgai tribesmen, and it seems [65 dd—5]'2 probable that since his recall to the capital in April 1931 they had ceased to regard him as their leader, and were in any case not sorry to be freed from a suzerainty whioh must at times have proved irksome and even oppressive. \\ hether their lot has improved under the rule of a Military Governor is a question which is not easily answered. Of the other tribes—the Khamseh, the Boir Ahmadi and Mamassani—littl^ was heard though progress was reported with the Government s efforts to settle them in the new town of Tul-i-Khosro. The imprisonment of the Kawam-ul-Mulk in December, beyond giving rise to one or two bazaar rumours, provoked little comment. The confiscation of his lands in June 1932 undoubtedly threw many of the Khamseh tribesmen out of work, and it is pretty certain that some of these threw in their lot with the various robber bands which were in evidence during the year. Such bands were not, however, predominantly tribal, but were composed of men thrown together by necessity and with no other means of earning a livelihood. They were dispersed one by one, and several notorious leaders, including Sar Mast, a relative of the once formidable Mehdi Surkhi, were captured. With the exception of a minor epidemic of “ hold-ups” in the middle of the summer when lorries were plundered between Bushire and Shiraz, and Shiraz and Isfahan, there was little interference with traffic on the main roads. In outlying districts, notably in the neighbourhood of Fasa and Jahrum, various acts of brigandage were committed and various clashes between the amnieh and the robbers were reported, but the number of such incidents showed a marked diminution in the latter half of the year, attributable perhaps to the submission of Ali Khan and his followers, as well as to extensive “ round-ups ” carried out by the military. 2. Haji Shams-ud-Din Jalali, who had been appointed Governor-General in Ears in July 1932, was suddenly recalled to Tehran on the 19th August. After a short interval, during which Mirza Mohd Ali Khan Shaibani, director of the Finance Department of Fars, assumed the duties of Acting Governor-General, Mirza Majid Khan Ahi, formerly of the Judicial Department in Tehran, was appointed to the vacant post and arrived in Shiraz on the 29th September. The new Governor-General, whose pet schemes are to provide Shiraz with an adequate water supply and to construct additional “ khiabans,” has proved himself a capable and energetic official, and has adopted a helpful and friendly attitude towards His Majesty’s consulate. Other local officials also appeared to be well disposed but, acting evidently on instructions not to enter into intimate relations with foreigners of any description, were careful to keep themselves at a discreet distance. The ban also fell, though perhaps less rigidly, on non-officials, and there was more than one instance of Persian visitors to the consulate being questioned by the police as to the reason of their visit. As a result, many of those who used to be frequent visitors latterly never put in an appearance. In some cases they expressed regret and hinted darkly that they would like to, but feared the consequences. A notable and pleasant exception was provided by one old Persian merchant of some 70 or 80 years of age, formerly a power in Shiraz, now something of a spent force but still a greatly respected figure, who arrived quite cheerfully astride his donkey, whenever an occasion for calling presented itself. Economic hardships, probably prevented the people from bothering their heads overmuch with political Questions, and the Basidu incident, though reported briefly in the local press, failed to arouse any real interest, much less ill-feeling. Similarly, the press article dispute in the latter part of the year produced no visible repercussions, and probably passed unnoticed by all save habitual readers of the Tehran newspapers. What is more certain, however, is that there were genuine and widespread complaints against the present Government and a belief, freely expressed, that its economic policy was ruining the country. Landowners and cultivators found it impossible to pay the revenue charges of two or three years ago. The Govern ment Departments would agree to no diminution, and failure to pay meant fines and confiscation of crops. The merchants also, fettered by regulations and handicapped by the almost complete cessation of the opium trade and the poverty of the peasants which its non-cultivation entailed, and bv the fact that the present import quotas tended to divert traffic from the Bushire-Shiraz route to the Bandar Shahpur-Ahwaz - ri3 route, complained bitterly that the volume of trade had shrunk to one-third of what it had been in former years. While such complaints were not aimed directly against His Imperial Majesty, there can be little doubt that part of the blame for the present state of affairs was attached to him and, though he was still admired for his courage and energy, certain veiled criticisms of his action in acquiring property for himself at the expense of his people were heard from widely separated quarters. The condition of roads and communications in the province showed no appreciable change from the previous year. Minor improvements were effected on the roads from Shiraz to Bushire and Isfahan, and repair gangs were in evidence at various points. Shiraz was linked by telegraph to Ardakan to the north-west and to Firuzabad to the south. Work on the new motor road to the latter town was commenced, and a strip extending some 5 or 6 miles out of Shiraz was completed by the end of the year. The intention is that traffic between Bushire and Shiraz should eventually travel via this route instead of as at present via Kazerun. The upkeep of the streets of Shiraz was on the whole satisfactory, though several gaping holes at various points threatened disaster to the unwary motorist. A newly acquired motor fire-engine contributed to the watering of the main thoroughfares and also to the entertainment of the populace, since it never tailed to attract an admiring crowd whenever it stopped to refill. Remarkable progress was made during the year with the project for erecting a spinning mill in the town. After some initial difficulties a company was quickly formed, and in March an order was placed with Messrs Platt Brothers and Co. (Ltd.) of Oldham for 5,000 spindles. During the summer work proceeded steadily with the construction of the mill building; in the autumn the machinery duly arrived at Bushire, was transported to Shiraz and the work of fitting and installing under the supervision of an English mill manager, an English mecnanic and two English fitters was well advanced at the close of the year. Sir Aurel Stein, K.C.I.E., having paid a brief visit to Shiraz in March, returned in November with the intention of making an extended archaeological tour in the eastern and south-eastern portions of the province. After a short delay due to difficulties over escort arrangements, Sir Aurel left Shiraz on the 21st November for Firuzabad. The following day news was received from His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran that the local authorities considered visits to certain places, including Lar and Darab, for the present inadvisable. In spite of various representations, this decision was maintained until the end of the year. In November a party of Anglo-Persian Oil Company geologists under Mr. Washington Gray, using Shiraz as their base, commenced a survey of the region included in the quadrilateral formed by Shiraz, Kazerun, Jahrum and Xiriz. A second party under Dr. Harrison starting from Isfahan were carrying out simultaneously a survey of the area to the north-west of Shiraz and to the south-east of Urdjan. Two Dominican priests, the Very Rev. Father Dominic Blencowe, O.P., and Father Cyprian Rice (formerly of the Levant consular service) arrived in Shiraz in November and rented two bungalows in wffiat was formerly the Indo-European Telegraph Department compound, for the purpose of founding a monastery. Their flowing white robes made them conspicuous figures when they appeared in the “ khiabans,” and at first aroused some curiosity amongst the inhabitants. Father Blencowe himself tells the story of the small boy who one night mistook him for a ghost and proceeded to throw stones at him. Their failure to produce a permit (which has since been granted) brought them into temporary conflict with the police authorities, who refused to allow them to receive persons into their chapel pending its production. There was reasonable evidence to suppose that a certain clique, of which M. Cassin, the French consul in Bushire, who spent a greater portion of the summer and autumn in Shiraz, appeared to be the leader, resented the appointment of British priests to a district which had hitherto been attended to by French priests from Isfahan.

The reports that reach the acting consul at Shiraz are highly conflicting and it is difficult to form a connected story on which any reliability could be placed.

The total troops in the field are now about 2,500. Ali Khan is rumoured to be at the head of no less than 15,000 rebels and to have been joined by some of the Khamseh Arabs and Luristanis. 3.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a most interesting report by Mr. J. P. Summerscale upon the state of agriculture in Ears. 2. The picture is not a cheeerful one, and shows that the increased efficiency in general administration which the Pahlavi regime has undoubtedly brought about has failed to remove the sense of insecurity (both physical and moral, as Mr. Summerscale points out) from which the Persian peasant has always suffered. The only difference seems to be that the sense of insecurity has spread to the landlord, who seldom has the means, if he has the will, to develop his estates. 3. A slightly different picture is presented by certain parts of the north, if the experience of some members of the great Hamadani land-owing family of Qaragozloo is any guide. Their peasants, they say, are completely out of hand, and appeal to the police and the law courts at every turn whenever the landlord attempts to assert his rights or declines to sanction some extravagant improve ment. This may be true, but, if it is, the material advantage that the peasant gains is not obvious, judging from the incredible raggedness of their clothes. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the acting British consul at Shiraz (No. 7). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum on the State of Agriculture in South Persia, particularly in the Province of Pars. AGRICULTURE, which is the main resource of the country, is at present very backward; it ought and could be a means, not as now of mere existence, but of prosperity. Large-scale methods and elaborate modern machinery aie neithei necessary nor desirable to achieve this. More plentiful water supply and greater security are the main determining factors. At present it is estimated that about one-third of the available water supply is utilised. One-third is allowed to run to waste, and one-third more could be obtained by lengthening and cleaning “ qanats.” This essential improvement, and indeed all progress, is prevented originallv by the land-owning system—absentee—landlordism with no long sighted view. The owners will not spend a penny on improvements. The peasants, who are not proprietors, might possibly—though not very probably be interested in improvements if it were not for insecurity of two kinds : (a) actual physical insecurity—depredations by the military or by robbers; (h) insecurity as regards taxes and unjust assessments and certainty of unjust treatment by the landlord’s agent. In these circumstances progress is not possible. The only hope of progress lies in peasant proprietorship plus security. This could be secured by legislation, the creation of an agricultural bank, both backed by a long-sighted and disinterested Minister of Agriculture together with just taxation and real security. From the present regime this seems improbable. The majority ot the Majlis consists, in fact, of “ absentee landlords ” interested in the maintenance of thou* estates The condition of the peasant to-day is much worse than, say, even five years ago. One hardly sees a single villager who is not clad in rags; their hovels are pitifully destitute of any semblance of comfort or even decency. Their cattle are on the verge of starvation; they themselves look under-nourished, spiritless. [775 1—1]2 ^ a ? e patient, surprisingly jovial and kindly. Their one c ‘ luxury,” tea an sugai, is now so dear as to be well-nigh unbuyable. The repercussion of the misery or the peasants is clearly seen in the towns, e.g., in Shiraz, Niriz. .Business has been extremely bad, and no amount of “ local industrialisation ” so much m tavour at present can improve conditions until the purchasing power of the peasant is raised. A slight improvement in 1933 over 1932 may be expected ^ puiely on grounds of better rainfall, but the fundamental prosperity of th^ country can only be affected by real reforms. Taxation is high and the proceeds thereof are largely transferred to Tehran; oi 1 i 6 / 8 USe( ^ ^ 01 ^ le t )ene fit the south. The Mamassani country, in which the Shah has recently founded the new town of Tol-i-Khosro, to be settled by tribespeople, is a most fertile and promising region, but significantly it was bettei worked a few years ago than now, and under present conditions the peasants show few signs of wishing to develop that region. Around Lake Niriz a certain amount of Government encouragement has led to the extension of the cultivated area, but on a very small scale. In recent years the Jews of Shiraz have tended to displace the original Persian landowners. The change is for the worse. Even more grasping than the owneis fh e y displaced, the Jews, never distinguished as agriculturalists, are equally short-sighted as regards general policy. Two important villages which ha\e fallen largely into the hands of Jewish merchants are Sivand and Zarghoun. The effect of the opium monopoly on the prosperity of Ears is also a factor of importance. Although the monopoly was terminated in November 1932, the retention of a heavy export tax still crippled the opium trade. Turkey and Russia benefit by Persia’s policy. The year 1933 is looked upon as holding hopes of better times than 1932. The improvement, if realised, can only be relative. A walk through any village in the neighbourhood of Shiraz would convince an observer of the immense scope for improvement. The only villages with any semblance of a decent standard of living seem to be those in the neighbourhood of Persepolis, where the men can supplement their earnings by working on the excavations. J.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a memorandum by the acting British consul, Shiraz, on the subject of events and conditions in Fars during the year 1932. Tehran. February 3. 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. Summary of Events and Conditions in Fars in 1932. (Confidential.) THE year 1932 was in the main not markedly different from the preceding year. Security was somewhat less good than in 1931, particularly in the latter half of the year, which closed with operations of a military nature being taken in the region of Firuzabad against Ali Khan, a stepbrother of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. Rainfall had been poor in the winter of 1931-32; the opium monopoly had ruined the mainstay of peasant cultivators so that the condition of the lower classes was desperate throughout the year. 2. Farajullah Khan Bahrami, who had been the first civil Governor-General in Fars since 1929, was transferred to Tehran on the 22nd March, where he was appointed Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Shortly afterwards Mohammad Ali Khan Shaibani, the Director of Finance for Fars and brother of the imprisoned Amir Lashkar, previously in Shiraz, was appointed Acting Governor- General, and he continued to discharge the double function till the 14th July, when Hajji Shams-ed-Din Jalali arrived from Isfahan, where he had been Governor for a year. The administration of the province passed more and more into the hands of the civil authorities and the military nature of the regime in Fars gradually disappeared save amongst the tribes and one or two outlying districts such as Ear and Firuzabad. 3. The Fars troops continued to be under the command of Sarhang Ibrahim Khan Zandieh. The normal strength of the troops kept in Shiraz appeared to be about 2,000. No troubles occurred which called for extensive operations; i July a contingent of about 500 troops under the command of Sarhang Hussein Khan Pur Rastigar, which had left for Dasht in the previous November to co-operate with other forces in disarming that region, returned to Shiraz. In the Province of Shiraz very severe restrictions were placed upon the possession of firearms of any description and later in the year it was made a capital offence to be found in possession of any breech-loading weapon. Ali Khan remained unsubdued, but inactive, till about October. His followers then began to terrorise the Firuzabad region and on the 16th November about 1.000 troops proceeded to Firuzabad under the command of Sarhang Saadi. They drove Ali Khan and his followers—who were reported to number only about 100 fighting men—further into the hills and slight engagements took place in which a few casualties were sustained. By the close of the year the operations had not been terminated and Ali Khan was still at large. He was offered terms in the course of December, but declined them. 4. Security was good in the early months of the year, but as the effects of the | poor rains made themselves felt brigandage began to increase. In • all, some six armed robberies occurred on the Shiraz-Bushire road and two on the Shiraz-Isfahan road. In outlying parts of Fars. robberies on minor roads were much more numerous. Niriz. Fasa, Firuzabad [719 dd—4]and Lar were the regions most affected. The Sorkhi family were responsible for much of the trouble. Jan Mohamed Sorkhi was captured and hanged in July. Another famous brigand, Hadi. was shot. His relatives, however, took upon themselves to avenge him, and were responsible for much trouble round Lar in the last month of the year. The Amnieh was active and, on the whole, not ineffective. Large numbers of robbers were executed publicly by firing parties in Shiraz. An increase in severity was noted in November and December, and protests were made that many men had been shot, without proof of brigandage, simply for carrying guns. 5. The policy of disarming the tribes and keeping them entirely divorced from their hereditary leaders was pursued vigorously. By a law passed on the 7th June, 1932, the whole of the properties belonging to the Qawam-ul-Mulk in bars were transferred to the Government, the Qawam receiving other land in compensation in northern provinces. The blow struck at Sowlet-ed-Dowleh was much more severe. He and his son. Deputies to the Majlis and not allowed to leave Tehran, were accused of conspiracy with the tribes and in August were arrested and put in prison, where they still were at the end of the year. The nature of the evidence against them does not appear to be entirely convincing. hat their eventual fate will be remains a matter for conjecture. The tribes themselves had a very bad year. Lack of water led to great losses amongst their live-stock and considerable suffering to themselves. It was impossible in the circumstances to enforce the policy of forcing the nomads to settle permanently. Some few were persuaded to do so and a new village was built at Tol-i-Khosro, in the vicinity of Ardekan, for this purpose. 6. His Imperial Majesty visited Shiraz on the 28th October and remained until the 2nd November. He appeared very mistrustful of the Shirazis, mounted his own guard in the Arg and went out very rarely. He treated everyone— particularly the merchants—in a very cavalier way. His visit added to the fear be inspires, but certainly in no way enhanced his popularity. He did his best to find fault with the troops, but actually could discover little to criticise. It had been rumoured that His Imperial Majesty intended to visit the town of Tol-i- Khosro, which he had caused to be built, but the visit was not carried out, due, it is said, to apprehensions as to the attitude of the Boir Ahmedi tribe in that region. 7. Municipal services did not launch out into new projects in 1932. One extra khiaban was completed, a few more streets were electrically lit. By the end of the year—accelerated undoubtedly by the Shah’s visit—Shiraz presented an appearance of orderliness and completeness few other Persian towns can equal. A great deal of new building took place during the year—a form of investment to which merchants here frequently turn in bad trading times—and the favoured side of the city was the western side. The Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment property was sold in the first half of the year, not to the Opium Monopoly Department, who were once in the field as possible buyers, but to a little-known merchant. The roads in and around Shiraz were well maintained and the stretch. Shiraz to Abadeh, was so good as to evoke favourable comment from the Shah. r The excavations at Persepolis financed by the Oriental Institute (a branch of the Lniversity of Chicago) continued under the guidance of Professor Herzfeld and a number of important finds were made, including a very fine stairway in excellent preservation. The health of the town was good throughout the year. There were no serious epidemics, although the standard of life of the poorer classes was still further reduced and many evidences of extreme poverty were to be seen. The building of the Church Missionary Society new hospital went on, and in spite of a fire, which destroyed the roof in May and caused about £300 damage, was practically' completed by the end of the year. 8. Ihe effect of the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession in Shiraz is worth mentioning. In general the population here seems to be friendly disposed to the British; it is certain that the demonstrations of joy over the “deliverance” of Persia were enforced by Government officials. An atmosphere of antagonism was engendered, and for a short time there was a very definite avoidance of contact with British residents by all Persians. This attitude, however, changed after about a month and by Christmas normal friendly relations were resumed. Although at Christmas cards were left by a number of officials, it is impossible for British officials here to enter into friendly relations with any but the Governor-URJ'-flMP' 3 General. Until the visit of the Shah, the head of the Finance Department was extremely friendly with all foreign residents, but since then has “dropped' them completely. 9. Trading conditions were poor throughout the year. The opium trade was practically at a standstill; the gums, hides and carpets fetched very low prices ^foreign markets, and as a result of the inflated export to meet the requirements the Trade Monopoly Law demand declined as the year advanced. The chief change in the character of trade has been the loss of ground by the Russians in the face of Japanese competition; relatively the English share of the piece-goods market did not alter very much, but fell off in volume. “ Luxury ' goods of any sort have practically disappeared from the Shiraz bazaar and are not being replaced. Towards the end of the year the “deadness' of the bazaar was very obvious; casual visitors were struck by the emptiness of them and the forlorn look of the neglected shops. After the criticism of the Shah, efforts were made to float a company for working a cotton-spinning and weaving mill. Some progress was made, but by the close of 1932 it was still doubtful whether the project would materialise, in spite of heavy pressure from the Governor-General. 10. The school connected with the Church Missionary Society, although a primary school, continued open. The principal, Miss Gerrard, assumed Persian nationality and is having the school registered as a Persian school. Its connexion with the Church Missionary Society, never very strong, has now practically vanished. The cinemas of Shiraz once swelled to four in number during the summer of 1932, but two failed; the quality of films shown remained very poor. Men and women, except in the “boxes.' were still segregated. The year in general was a disappointing one in the Province of Ears. Crops were well below average; prices for external exports were low, while the cost of local commodities rose. The poorer people became more and more ragged as the year went on; the competition of foreign goods was much restricted. There was undoubtedly a great deal of want and suffering, all of which seems to have been borne with surprising patience and fortitude. Rain and snow in the month of December aroused the hope that 1933 would be a better year than the last. It is possible that there may be considerable local improvement in the next year, but less probability that commerce will improve unless the conditions of foreign trade are modified and the tax on opium exports reduced. There is no reason to suppose that the general attitude of somewhat grudging submission to the present regime will be modified in any more active direction; and it is indisputable that a certain section of the population is definitely in favour of the new order. J. P. SUMMERSCALE.t)ECR2T . 3, extracts from Rtport aade in 1926 by Lt. K.'tf. Fletcher, R.A # on local conditionu In Pars, Southern Persia. u ^ G*2S£ 2l trend of opinion . During the period April 1925 to M-urch 1926 a very marked improvement took place in the atitude of the inhabitante t eepecially of Sbiraz, towards the English. An atmosphere of suspicion still surrounds all foreigners, especially British Officers. Our prestige is extremely high and all classes share the belief that the present Shah holds his position entirely through British influence. The troubles of Prance in Syria and the Riff are, even a/fiong the educated classes, attributed to British influence. The League of Nations is smiled at as being merely a cloak for British diplomacy. There is considerable sympathy for the Riffs but over the ! osul question sympathy is al ost entirely on our side. Among the poorer classes, and especially among the ex-soldiers of the South Persian Hi flee, there is an Appreciable feeling in favour of coming under English advisers, or even under English rule but the educated classes, and especially the Press are rabidly nationalistic and would like to see all foreigners out of Persia and all concessions, especially the oil concession, abolished. Western ideas are coming in rapidly and a start has been made in introducing games, especially foot-ball, and gymnastics in Shiras. O.O.C. Para . AUIR LA 8 HKAR i£AHMtn&gt;*I-IRAM was a comrade of the present Shah and has risen from the ranks, while possessing littlelittle education, he ie by no means a fool, and has plenty of common sense and power of organisation. He is very popular anong the troops, I personally found him very friendly and he professed to like the British and to dislike the Russians, and especially the Russian consul. Chief of Staff, and a son of the Porinan Forina, educated in Russia and France, and possessing a fluent knowledge of Russian, French, and English, this officer is the main of the 'Southern Command', He is a young man, very energetic and extremely keen on reforming the army. He realizes that esprit dc corps is the stumbling block. Manoeuvres (in 1925) he was inclined to be cold to ards the British and to manifest contempt for British Military methods. On his return he expressed unbounded admiration and ie keen to get Tehran to consent to the despatch of a body of Persian officers to India for attachment to British units to study interior economy. The Bew Regime and the attitude of the people . with the masses. The villagers, especially revered Ahmed Shah as the 'Shadow of Cod', and I often was asked why he did not return to put the Va*ir~i~8ang in his place. During the illuminations and celebrations to make the deposition of Ahmed Shah and the accession of Reza Khan only the Government Offices were decorated. The rest of the town was in darkness. Popular belief ascribes the change in ruler to the British, and this view ie also openly expressed by the Russian consul who does not conceal hie disgust at the new regime. £ART IP MAHOMED HUCAIN MIRZA One of the tyajar princes Before hie visit to ' orthern Command (India) The deposition of the qajar dynasty was not popular Latterly1r *&gt; Latterly popular opinion has veered round, and the popularity of Resa Khan is, except among the nomad tribes and robbers, everywhere on the increase. The chief boon which he has brought to the country is security, and now practically all parts are safe for travellers except the region inhabited U'Yvn Os by the Hama Semnis and the Shibh dalukis. But though the disarmament has helped towards the establishment of internal security, it has left the villager with no means of defence against the att ick of wild pigs on his crops. The oppression and tyranny of the Officers and men is a cause of discontent and the law courts are oven more corrupt than formerly. The merchants are dissatisfied with the new taxes on tea and sugar, and trade in Shiraz according to all accounts, has never been worse. The elections are, of course, a pure ramp and all voters are told which way to vote. The newspapers are strictly censured, and in Shiraz all newspaper editors were summoned to the presence of the Amir Lashkar and told that no articles against the Government would be tolerated. The Rais-ul-Pugara or head of the dervishes, and the Tath ut Hulk have only recently been released from prison for writing 'shabnamaha' against the Government. Yet on the whole the people realize that Persia is not ready for eonstitutional government, and are becoming more and more satisfied. foreign intrigue in the Province. The present Russian consul at Shiraz, Hr. VALIDIN or tTGLDlKN, has been unremitting in his efforts to stir up feeling against the British. He has over and over again openly announced his hostility to us, and his intention of annoying and insulting the JSnglish residents in Shiras in every way possible. During the past year he has given several entertainmentsentertainments to the townspeople upon TariouB Soviet holidays. This, however, has not had much effect. He is known to he openly hostile to the new regime and among the wealthy and influential Persians is moot unpopular. The Russian consulate is closely watched night and day and all Persians who visit there are reported to the authorities. In the summer (1925) he had a serious disagreement with the Governor General and in March this year (1926) the Arair lashkar told me he was very annoyed with him and had issued orders that no officer should visit the Consulate. These orders also, as a natter of fact, included the British Consulate. In November 1925 a Persian named rIR‘5A ALI KHAN HOfMtAND employed as Munshi by the Russian Consul several times came to me and made allegations against his employer. The only one which subsequently proved true was that the Russian Consul was intriguing with the NASIR-I-BIVAN. Hoshraand was formerly in the Intelligence Service of the South Persian Rifles, and seemed to me thoroughly untrustworthy and merely out for money. ABBAS qULI KHAN who was for a year Vice-Consul of the Russian Consulate was dismissed at the end of 1925 and came to me, wanting to be employed as a British Intelligence Agent in Russia and offering to send his son to India as a hostage for his good behaviour. He also has an unsavoury reputation, and it is quite possible that his dismissal from the Consulate was merely pet itious. At the time of the accession of the new Bhah, the Russian Consul paid a visit to KA22RUN and BCGHIIB. In the former place he visited the NASIR-1-DIVAN and was refused an interview by the Governor. He also went to 8KAPUR and gotinto touch with the MAMA 8JSMMIS. In Shlras his wife struck up a close friendship with one MIM TAJ KHANHM a celebrated Shiraz courtesan! at the time living with n officer of the Persian staff* This intrigue was for the purpose of finding out what was going on in the Staff Office reference disarming the tribes. The notorious Mr, #A8FM T JSS is now at CKAKABAK near Bushire and has imported a large number of agricultural implements and is ostensibly engaged in experimenting with mechanical methods of agriculture. He has several Germane with him, presumably engaged in agriculture. The Governor of Kazerun is, however, somewhat suspicious of his connection with the late trouble there. In the winter of 1925*26 Kr. fa^srauss paid a visit to Shiraz and visited the rtJSKIR family with whom he is still on good terms. He is now very hard put to it for funds and has been in communication with the Russian consul. On the whole it seams conclusive that the Russian Consul was primarily responsible for the Mama Seramis outbreak. The Amir Lashk&amp;r admitted as much to me and told me that, if Mr, ’vasamuEs through want of funds should join in, it would be very serious, Mr, wassause still has tremendous influence and popularity among the &lt;tAGH OAIS and the people of Tangistan. $uite recently he w s able to persuade the son of SHKIKH HTJS83SIH of AHMBBl to part with the money which had arrived in the German Legation Tehran as a reward for his assistance to the Germans during the war, in order to buy agricultural implements. It eeems probable that should any untoward accident befall UK'5 a KHAN the Russians might succeed in stirring up the ^ASH GAI8 and Tangiatans to rise against the Government.— i «' KRt The Saulat eridently does not like the fioleherints but probably aees in them a faint hope of regaining hie tribe and hie power again. The eame probably appliee to the tfaeir-i^Divan. Mr* waeemuee is still very anti-British and how tor he might deeire to fill hie pockets by intrigue is of course problematic. There are now in Shirae about half a dosen Germane moot of them practically paupers. The Russian consul has tried to enliet their sympathies with the Soviet but, so far, without result. The Bolshevist Menace . At the moment Russian intrigue has met with a decisive setback but at the same time it must be remembered that Persia or at any rate South Persia fulfils many of the conditions favourable to an outbreak of Communism. 'he lower classes are ground down and opposed by the upper. There are large sections of naturally warlike people, i•e. the nomad tribes, dissatisfied with the existing regime; and last but not least the Government is a military despotism by an ill-disciplined army, the rank and file of which are not regularly paid. Obedience is exacted by fear, and the relation of officers to men is the Prussian relation. The great obstacle to the spread of communism is the Mohammedan religion. 1 was repeatedly assured that Persia would never become Bolshevik because Bolshevism is contrary to the tenets of Islam. Yet it has to be remembered that the power of the Shiah clergy and the hold which religion has on the people, are daily weakening. At the moment and so long as Reza Khan is alive there is no chance of any trouble occurring, but should he be assassinated it seems all too likely that the events of the last few years in China will repeat themselves in Persia, and thatmammrnmmmmiKm W that Persia will become the cockpit for the armies of riral Generals and warring tribal chiefs• If that should come to pass, it cannot be denied that the Russians will hare a great opportunity of organising, if not a Bolshevist rebellion, an anti-foreign campaign similar to that which has lately been witnessed in China. A European merchant who had lived all his life in the country and wae employed by a Persian firm, went srsn further and assured me that it was only a matter of time before Persia became Bolshevist. Though in my opinion his was an extreme view, yet 1 do think that the affairs are not quite so rosy as the Press would like to make out, and that there is a very real danger of the country lapsing into chaos and Bolshevism. The whole life and prosperity of the nation is solely dependent upon one man Resa Khan, he is no longer young. Pinance * The American mission has effected considerable reform but they are not so well thought of among Persians as their own reports would load us to suppose. The^qpi^^ of most Persians who are connected w f e:,t • is that the Americans t* 1 * orient such as the Brit i«n have. Sven the extreme anglophobes have admitted to me that the brief period of office of the English advisers some years ago was much more satisfactory. Corruption is universal, chiefly owing to the absurdly low salaries paid to subordinates which forces than either to rob or starve. In March 1926 fcajor HALL of the American ? ission arrived in Shirax to take over the whole of the PARS finance adminl ctrat ion. Among the reforms latterly introduced, which has given universal satisfaction, is the abolition of the road tolls on all roads, and the substitution of a yearly tax on all animals.Notes.

(GOEig. » / • f^f 7 10/'' Britiah Consulate, Shir as* September 7th 1932* Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 9 of this morning I have the honour to give an account of the situation in Fare as known to me in so far as it has some hearing upon the alleged intrigues of Sowlat-ed-Dowleh* 2* In the first place no rumours of any sort preceded your telegram No* 9 nor the newspaper report which followed quickly upon it* The news was apparently a complete surprise in all quarters. This may indicate one of two things - either that Sowlat has not been intriguing with the Qashqaie, or that he did so in an extremely skilful and secret manner. Local opinion is strongly inclined to favour the first alternative partly basing my this upon Sowlat's good sense and secondly upon the fact that it has been expected that some excuse would be found to ruin him still further. In any case there is no knowledge locally, nor even bazaar rumours, of any evidence of intrigues by Sowlat* 3. Unrest in the province of Fare is widespread* There has been a gradual increase in the number of road crimes, attacks on villages and other forms of armed robbery. It is no doubt true that majority of these attacks are committed by tribesmen - Khamaeh Arabs, Qashqai and refugees from Dasht* It is perhaps an indication of growing uneasiness on the part of the authorities that although until very recently no public executions had taken place in Shira^c Within the last fortnight four robbers have been publicly shot by military firing parties in view of the Khiaban-i-Saadi. The area around Baiza and particularly the pass of Malisjoon is infested with robbers to such an extent that the movements of local His Britannic Majesty's Minister, etc*,etc*,etc*, British Legation.•..Gulhek*2 local products le at a stcndbtill® The Sorkhl family effectually terrorise the country south of Shiraz in the direction of Firuzabad# Near Riruzhhad itself, Ali Khan, a brother of the Sowlat, remains a menace unsubdued since the troubles of 1929® Generally he lives on a footing of non-interference with the authorities reciprocated by them® At the moment, however, the military commander of the 250 troops at Firuzabad seems to apprehend trouble and to seek to avoid causing a clash, for in the face of alleged threats by All Khan to seize any grain moved in that region, the transport of all corn has been forbidden* A further indication of apprehension on the part of the authorities is the hasty construction of military posts on the Ardakan road for which work local labourers and masons have been impressed* 4* However, the situation does not seem to have changed in any fundamental way in recent weeks# The outbreaks are sporadic and unconnected. There is no evidence of any co-operation between the various bands. Everything points ts the motive for almost all the crimes being great distress and want. 1 can find no one locally who would attach any political importance to the unrest in the province. It is considered that the Qashqais suffered so severely in their last clash with the Governmenr that they are in no position to undertake any concerted action. They are at least partially disarmed, their cattle decimated by drought and they themselves suffering from extreme poverty and distress. The ground might seem ripe for sowing the seeds of revolt but conditions are such that it would seem more likely that the form it will take will be an intensification of the small scale robbery and banditry which serves to relieve those who are in the most desperate want. Amongst these are numbers of ^professional* 1 robbers - such as the Sorkhi - totally uninterested in any organised operations* 5* On September the 5th the Governor-General left Shiraz for the first time since his appointment to go to Fasa* The ostensible reason is that he is to supervise the distribution and organisation of relief to the town which suffered considerably in the rains of JulyoJuly* There would seem to 'be no good grounds to suppose any other reason for his visiting Pass except that given and the implication of his absence would seem to be that no complications are expected in this region* Similarly the rumoured visit of the Shah to these parts within three weeks does not appear to be relevant. He is reported to be coming to visit the Mamassani country and to have in view the founding there of a new town to be called ’’Nasir Khosro M * It is of course quite conceivable that he wishes to inspect personally the somewhat wayward province of Pars. 6. As regards Shiraz itself the townspeople, although increas ingly dssatisfied with the heavy taxation and the difficulties imposed upon trade, would be unlikely to turn either to Sowlat or to the Qawam for aid even if either of these was disposed to afford assistance* Of the two Sowlat is disliked the more thou^i both are unpopular on account of past extortions and abuses. Two sons of Sardar Ihtesham, Ami Hussain Khan and Mirza Nasrullah Khan, are resident in Shiraz but are not known to be involved in any but private affairs. 7.

Sir Your most obedient humble Servant (Signed) J. p. SUIHRtOAU(copy) Confidential. British Consulate, Ho. 37© rf? Shiraz© Septemher 13th 1932. In continuation of my despatch No. 35 of 7th September, I have the honour to report that I have now obtained some information concerning the alleged intrigues of the Sowlat-ed-Dowleh. This information hardly bears any higher value than that of hearsay but may be of some interest. As stated in my previous despatch on this subject there are no general rumours conerning the Sowlat and surprisingly little local interest has been aroused by the recent news about him. However, it is now certain that in a few local circles rumours are now circulating about letters alleged to have been sent by the Sowlat with the aim of stirring up trouble amongst the tribes. 2© One rumour is merely to the effect that the Sowlat has been in communication with the Boir Ahmedi instigating them to cause trouble. It is not supported either by arrests amongst the Boir Ahmedi or by reports of the alleged contents of the letters. A more circumstantial rumour says that two brothers, Shaikh ^ohamed Hassan and Shaikh Habibullah Muaven, the former a lawyer who took charge of the Sowla^s cases before the Adlieh and the second a teacher of the Sowlat’s sons, recently received a letter from the Sowlat-ed-Dowleh which fell into the hands of the police. The letter, so it is said, was to the effect that a large sum of money was to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, etc., etc., etc., British Legation......Gulhek.to be transmitted for the repair of a 'qanat' - 'not t© be carried out badly as was done three years ago, but well and sufficiently* 1 . These brothers afce quite legitimately agents of the 3owlat-ed-Dowleh for the maintenance of his estates, but it has been ascertained that there are no 'qanafcs on the estates needing extensive repairs. This communication, couched in rather ambiguous terms, was therefore considered suspect and the two brothers have been sent under arrest to Tehran. It is also reported that a number of the Sowlat*s dependents and 'KadJchudas” have been sent to Tehran for examination. 3. As is obvious, both these rumours may be merely local inventions, or may be perversions of some grain of truth contained in them. I should be glad to be informed whether it is desired that I should report further rumours of this kind which may come to my ears but which I am in no way able to substantiate.

Copy has been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 42) of the 3rd March, 1932. Tehran, March 3, 1932. Enclosure in No. 1. Summary of Events and Conditions in Ears during the Year 1931. THIS period passed unusually quietly. The tribes, even if not all perhaps subdued in spirit, lacked leaders and also ammunition and the means of buying or otherwise obtaining it. There were no serious disturbances, and the Central Government continued to increase its hold on the province. However, though the number of troops was decreased and though the post of Governor-General was once again given to a civilian, the main administrative power outside the principal towns remained with the army, which had not been relegated to its more normal function of merely supporting civil authority. 2. In February the Amir Lashkar, Habibullah Khan Shaibani, left for Tehran, being relieved as Governor-General by Muzaffar Adam, who also- continued his previous work as Governor of Bushire and the Gulf ports. Muzaffar Adam held the two positions for five months and earned respect by his hard work. Regarding the reason given for his departure, there were a number of rumours, of which the most likely would seem to have been concerning certain disputes with the military. Farajullah Khan Bahrami, who had been Governor-General at Isfahan for a year, was transferred to Fars in the same capacity in August. He is also a man of industry, but the very great part of his work is connected with strictly local matters, such as municipal administration, while the control of outlying districts and of the tribes has, as has been already stated, remained largely with the military. After two years of an entirely military regime the resumption of civil power cannot in this country be other than gradual. Farajullah Khan, however, holds what is still an important position, and he is understood to have the ear of the Shah, having previously worked for some time in close touch with His Majesty. 3. Amir Lashkar Habibullah Khan, during the previous year, had directed considerable operations in difficult country against the Mamas sani and the Boir Ahmedi tribes; he had not been altogether successful and he made mistakes, but he had increased the security of the province and the prestige of his command. Ten months after leaving Shiraz he was, presumably owing to blunders made and jealousies aroused here, deprived of all military rank and imprisoned. The command of the mixed Fars brigade passed to Sarhang Ibrahim Khan Zandieh, a young officer appointed from Tehran. The brigade was much reduced in numbers during the year, for as no serious operations were undertaken here two regiments were moved elsewhere before the summer. A small force was sent from Shiraz in the autumn to Dashti, now outside the Province of Fars, to assist in the disarming of that neighbourhood. '[416 z—614. From the tribes many of the leaders were called to Tehran, where they will probably have to stay for long, against their wills and often in actual want, under the eye of their royal master. Registration, a necessary preliminary to j conscription, was not started, nor were further steps taken about enforcing dress | regulations outside the towns. Disarming was carried out by a number of commissions without great trouble, but with questionable success. Military officers were placed in charge of all the leading groups. Threats to stop all migration were not carried out. The connexion with the Qashqais of the family of Ismail Khan, Soulet-ed- Dowleh, was very much weakened. He himself was on friendly terms with Amir Lashkar Shaibani and early in the year assisted in the collection of arms from his tribe, but in April he was ordered to Tehran, and later on practically all his family and also many of the kalantars of the Qashqais had to follow him there. His son was relieved of the post of Ilkhani and a military officer, Sarhang Shakir Khan Tabatabai, was appointed in his place, but only joined i the tribes at the end of the year. The Boir Ahmedi and Mamassani districts were occupied by military posts and these tribes were increasingly divided up into small sections. Sartip Khan went to Tehran, and Mir Ghulam, the last of the important insurgent chiefs of the Boir Ahmedi, was killed in the early summer during a private quarrel. Others of the rebels of the previous year were caught and executed at Shiraz and Behbehan. These tribes are particularly intractable and can, no doubt, produce other leaders and still possess arms, but Sarhang Jehanbani, who was mainly responsible for their area, had no serious risings to quell. From the Khamseh tribes little of importance was heard. The Qawam did not visit Fars at all during 1931, but, from the fact that some of the more influential of his former lieutenants were sent for at the end of the year, it is surmised that he is involved in certain of the accusations and counter-claims -voiced in the capital about past troubles here. j 5. Security was certainly better and various brigands were brought to book, notably one Mehdi Surkhi, who had for long given trouble in the Fasa district and other parts; he was hanged in Shiraz in May. Another band was broken up at Mazijun, near Far, in March. Only one serious robbery was reported on the main Bushire road, and this occurred in July, when a car was held up near Khush-Ali and all the passengers, including an official of the Financial Department, were robbed and stripped. Few robberies were heard of in the latter part of the year either in Shiraz or on the main roads, where Amnieh posts are still numerous; on the 35 miles of main road between Shiraz and Persipolis, for example, there are five posts. On the less frequented roads complete safety cannot be relied on for some time to come. 6. Municipal and social services in Shiraz progressed. The electric lighting of the streets was started at the beginning of the year and the British engines worked well; probably no other town in the country has such an efficient electric supply. The new wide main streets were well kept and work on others was commenced. The completed roads are often lined with empty shops and some of the wounds caused by demolitions for these roads were still gaping, but the work was planned with care and none of the interesting old buildings were damaged. None of them, on the other hand, were repaired and the only work of restoration in the neighbourhood—that at Persipolis—has been undertaken by Germans, with American money, and does not appear to have aroused much interest among the Persians. An Italian subject works as engineer of the municipality. There were no serious epidemics. Apart from the Church Missionary Society's hospital, which is to be replaced by a larger building now under construction, there is no proper civil hospital, the military having acquired the two buildings given by Persians in the past for use as hospitals. A new and comparatively enlightened Director of Public Health was appointed in the summer. Ed ucati on remained in charge of Mirza Abul Qasim Khan Fuzuyat and the Persian schools are using less antiquated methods, even if their teaching is still superficial. The Church Missionary Society's school for girls was well attendedmtmm '■ ■ 5 ■H 3 by the children of leading Persians, but considerable interference from unintelli gent inspectors had to be borne. English is widely spoken in Shiraz owing to commercial connexion with the British Empire; even at the National Bank here, English is, after Persian, the most used language. 1 wo clean-looking hotels were opened and also a fine new cinema. The backwardness, though perhaps not the lack of sense, of Shiraz is somewhat shown ^ by the fact that men and women are not yet allowed to attend the cinemas at the same time; in other places in Persia the sexes are no longer separated in this way. 7. Outside the main towns, the only representatives of a beneficient Government who come into close touch with the people are the tax collectors and the military. The conditions of life in the villages have hardly changed for the better. The improvements to the main roads only affect them in that their animals are often, in more senses than one, driven off the main routes by motor transport. The road to Bushire was worked on and considerable widening was completed on a number of parts of the narrow passes. Work was continued to make the road from Kazerun to Khuzistan practicable for motors. In connexion with communications outside the towns, mention must be made of the departure in March of the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, whose predecessors did much to make movement in the province possible in former days. As the lines and other equipment of the Department were handed over to the Persian authorities in good order, deterioration was not really marked by the end of the year. One result of the departure of these officials is that reliable information with regard to happenings in the province is much harder to obtain than used to be the case. 8 . If the old menace of internal insecurity has been largely overcome, and if some conditions of life in the towns have been improved, the province is now in the throes of a severe struggle in its economic situation. The Province of Ears has, for many years, much depended on the opium trade, from which all classes derived profit. Owing to legislation, rather than to other conditions, such as world markets, the price of this drug has fallen greatly and a very large part of the year's crop remained unsold, even at its cheap price, in the Government monopoly stores; it is likely to stay there for a long while. The rainfall during the winter of 1930-31 was small, but this shortage will, according to local opinion, affect the crops of 1932 more than those of the period under review, which actually were up to average. There was very little outside demand for grain, so bread remained cheap. Very extreme poverty was, however, widespread, and the tribespeople and villagers no longer came to Shiraz with the good money to spend on which the town must largely exist. Tea and sugar became so expensive that many had to do without their favourite drink, and there was not enough money to buy the dearer materials to replace pitiful rags. Merchants struggled to find a way to work in with the complicated regula tions which had done much to paralyse local trade before the severity of the world crisis was felt. Of the money circulating in the form of paper at a month or two’s date, much had very little real money behind it. Eor the redress of wrongs, the townspeople and villagers could not rely •on the courts, of which the reputation was not good, and depression and pessimism were general. They have, nevertheless, extreme patience and surprising vitality, and have had to carry on before under circumstances quite as bad. C. H.
