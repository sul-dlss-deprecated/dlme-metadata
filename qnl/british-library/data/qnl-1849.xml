Foreign Office Press—824—24-1-05—14.No. 18 of 1905. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Fort William, the 19th January 1905, Sir, We have received your despatch No. 57 (Secret), dated 11th November 1904, on the subject of the posting of apolitical Agent at Koweit, and in reply we have the honour to submit the following observations in explanation of the attitude which the Government of India have adopted in the matter. from your predecessor, expressed an opinion in favour of the appointment of an Agent; but in view of objections raised by tlm Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, it was ultimately decided to continue the then existing practice of deputing an officer to Koweit from time to time from the Residency at Bushire. 3. In the early part of 1904, a new situation having arisen, in consequence of the armed intervention of the Turkish authorities in the struggle being carried on in Central Arabia between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud, the question of posting a British officer at Koweit was again raised, and on 24th June you sanctioned the appointment of an Agent in a telegram, in which ' Tri ” temporary. On the 28th July 1904, you ordered Captain Knox to j once to Koweit “ in such a manner that unnecessary attention may uuu ue attracted ”, and this telegram again contained nothing that could lead us to suppose that the appointment was not to be a permanent one. 4. In accordance with these instructions, Captain Knox proceeded to Koweit at the beginning of August, and in a letter, dated the 7th September / 1904, he was duly enjoined to act so as not to attract unnecessary attention, but nothing was said to him as to the temporary nature of his appointment. Since then he appears to have confined himself exclusively to tlm functions winch he was authorised by His Majesty’s Government to exercise, but no doubt he has done or said nothing that would convey the impression to the Sheikh that his appointment was anything but permanent. 5. Hence the arrangements in connection with the posting of the Political Agent at Koweit were throughout made on the supposition that the appoint ment was of the character that we have described, and this policy appeared au (yefl 1 * the time to be agreed to by all parties. From the instructions conveyed to us, ^ we do not see that any other inference was possible. More recently, however, the Turkish Ambassador has been informed that the appointment of a British officer to Koweit is only temporary, and we are requested to take measures with a view to the withdrawal of Captain Knox for a time. 2. On 31st July 1903, the Government of India, in reply to an enquiry were used which could be held to imply that the appointment6. We have received this intimation with regret, since the present appears to us to he a peculiarly inopportune moment for the adoption of any measure that may he thought to show a weakening of British interest or a surrender of British claims in any part of the Persian Gulf. You will perceive from the correspondence which accompanies this despatch that, though the Sheikh remains at present well affected towards the British connection, his attitude may, in the opinion of Major Cox, he altered, should existing conditions not he maintained in the future. Owing, apparently, to the failure of Ibn Rashid to maintain his position in Central Arabia, and possibly to the bad treatment accorded by him to his Turkish auxiliaries, the Porte seems to be seriously considering the advisability of confirming Ibn Saud in Nejd, on condition that he accepts Turkish supre macy. Major Cox, in his telegram of 28th December, considers that the reports of a tendency towards rapprochement are well founded, and he con siders that the Turks will, when terms are arranged, employ Saud to seduce Mubarak from his allegiance to us. Major Cox adds— “ As long as we maintain the present arrangement, I do not think we have much to fear; but if simultaneously with rapprochement t we go away or partially withdraw palpable support from Koweit, then the ultimate probability must be the secession of Mubarak ”. These considerations derive additional weight from a study of the present position in other parts of the Gulf. The recent occurrences at Bahrein show that the Ruler of that island by no means realises the attitude which is due from him to his British protector; and even if the measures which have been suggested to induce him to listen to the representations of the Political Resident are accepted by His Majesty’s Government and prove successful, the impression likely to result therefrom in the Persian Gulf generally may be neutralised by any appearance of diminution in the degree of support extended by us to the Sheikh of Koweit, who already suffers for his British connection at the hands of Turkish officials in the matter of his estates at Pao and its neighbourhood. 7 Since, however, a decision has been arrived at in the matter against which it would no longer be becoming on our part to protest, it is our duty to take steps to obey the instructions of His Majesty’s Government, and to consider how the manner and date of effecting the temporary withdrawal of Captain Knox can best be reconciled with the exigencies of the local situation, so as to avoid either exciting the suspicion or provoking the resentment of the Sheikh. The proposal which at present commends itself to us is that Captain Knox should at once inform the Sheikh that, pending the construction and comple tion of a suitable residence for himself, he does not see his way to spending the trying months of the hot weather at Koweit, and that he has, for reasons of health, applied for, and received, permission to leave temporarily at the end of March or beginning of April, on the understanding that he is to return when the climatic conditions render it safe to do so. A report on this scheme is expected from Major Cox, who has also been asked whether any other ground of temporary withdrawal would, in his opinion, be preferable; and until his reply has been received, it is difficult for us to decide finally in the matter. But whatever plan is . ultimately adopted, His Majesty’s Government will at once b e informed , and it may be assumed that the withdrawal will take place about the date to which reference has been made above. 8. In regard to the observations contained in paragraph 3 of your letter and of your telegram of 30th December, we have the honour to state that the instructions to Major Cox in regard to Nejd affairs were not intended to encourage the despatch of any officer to Riadh or to any other place in the interior of Arabia, but merely to secure as much early and accurate inform ation in rpp’nrn to ISiPirl nfP»n*T.o no —ui 1.

With reference to previous correspondence relating to the Chief of Koweit’s Turkish property, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Governmentof India, a copy of a despatch, No. 35, dated 15th July 1904, addres sed by His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Con stantinople, on the subject. No. 35, dated the 15th July 1904. From—J. H. Monahan, Esq., Acting British Consul, Basrah, To —His Excellency the Right Hon’ble Sir N. R. O’Conor, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. With reference to my telegram No. 37 of the 12th instant, I have the honour to report that shortly after the date of Mr. Crow’s departure, May 20th, the Sheikh of Koweit discovered that there was a mistake as to boundaries in the deed of settlement which had been drawn up to conclude the dispute between him and his nephews. This mistake had to be rectified by the law yers here. By order from the Ministry of Justice the execution of such a deed of settlement had to be attested by the Vali and his Council and not by a Notary Public. In consequence of the non-attendance of some members of the Council, this attestation, and a further attestation by B israh notables which was desired by the Sheikh of Koweit, was not completed, until the llth instant. Lastly, I also, in compliance with the Sheikh’s request, have affixed my attestation of the execution and of the signatures of the Yali and his Coun cil. Hive or six days ago £2,296f were paid to the nephews, and two promis sory notes were on the 27th ultimo given to them signed by the Sheikh’s Agent here to the order of Hajji Mauson, a local notable, one of the arbitrators in the case, for £2,000 payable in 45 days and £3,000 payable in 91 days from that date. This differs from the arrangement reported in Mr. Crow’s No. 24 (Cfl.) of May 12th, hut is considered to be quite safe. The nephews have received the five landed properties in question mentioned in Mr. Crow’s No. 13 of March 8th. In the deed of settlement which they have executed they state that they have received in cash all the money due to them. With reference to Your Excellency’s despatch of May 19th, I would submit that the exile of the two nephews to Baghdad could hardly he useful, as they could readily communicate thence through Samawa with Yusuf-ibn-Ibrahim in Nejd. I understand that the Sheikh is now amicably disposed towards his nephews and that their conduct and attitude have of late been unexceptionable.It would perhaps be best to wait and see bow they behave after they have got all the money or at any rate the second instalment of it.

Ibn Rashid s Arabs lost 400 in killed, including Majid-bin-Hamud and other Chiefs, and the Turks lost 1,000 killed, and 200 were taken prisoners, and their six guns were captured by the Wahabis.

In connection with the fighting between Ihn Saood and Ihn Rashid and the Turkish troops in his company, I haye the honour to forward translations of two interesting letters received at Bahrein and sent on to me hy the Assistant Political Agent. 2. They are so circumstantial as to make them worthy of some credence in corroboration of previous reports. Translation of a letter from Abdul Aziz-el-Saood, to Abdul Aziz-bin-Dukhil, dated the 3rd Jemad-el-Awal 1322 (17th July 1904)). I beg to inform you about what happened between me and Ihn Rashid. Ibn Rashid was at Khalfa, and I was at Absera. He left Khalfa and went to Debiyeh, and I proceeded to Bukeiriyeh. On Priday, 1st Jemad-el-Awal (15th July 1904), I attacked him. All the soldiers (Turkish?) and the people of Hyel with their horses opposed the people of Aredh, and we continued fighting till the afternoon. Thereafter the Bedouins began to leave by degrees, so the Aredh people were weakened and were defeated, and the loss of life was such as never occurred before. After the Bedouins were defeated, the Aredh people fled. They were pursued hy Ibn Rashid’s cavalry. They only lost 20 men. As regards the Kaseem people, they did not suffer any defeat. They marched against Ibn Rashid’s camp. In the evening they attacked the (Turkish) soldiers and Ibn Rashid, and defeated Ibn Rashid. My people captured 6 guns and 200 soldiers, and killed Majed-bin-Hammood, his brother, Saood, and Abdul Aziz-el-Juber; also 400 Hyel men and 1,000 soldiers. Ibn Rashid was severely wounded in the hand' and also in the side. God knows whether he will live or die. On this date I am at Boreida, and preparing to go after Ihn Rashid. According to the last news, Ihn Rashid is at Sefwara. I will send you the guns and soldiers hereafter. I send Abdul Ali to convey news to you. Translation of a letter from Muhammad-el-Ali-el-Selim, Koweit, to Mukbel-el-Dhakeir, dated the 16th Jemad-el-Awal 1322 (30th July 1904). I beg to inform you that Abdul Ali and his son arrived here yesterday, and have brought good news. They say that Ibn Saood marched against and occupied Bukeiriyeh. At eight hours after sunrise on Priday, 1st Jemad-el-Awal 1322 (15th July 1904), Ibn Rashid marched against him, and the latter went out to oppose him. The people of Aneiza and Boreida were on one side, and the people of Southern Halleh on the other. There were small mounds between them, and they spread as they moved. TFhile the Kaseem people and Ibn Saood were separated, a fight took place between Ibn Saood and Ibn Rashid from 8 o’clock to 10 o’clock (after sunrise). At first a cavalry charge was made. Saood-bin-Abdul Aziz (el-Saood ?) charged on horseback Abdul Aziz-bin-Mitaab (Ibn Rashid), and wounded him. After Ihn Rashid retired, the troops turned towards Majed- el-Hammood. At 10^ hours after sunrise, Ibn Saood was defeated, and he fled. The Kaseem did not know this, as there were mounds between them and they were fighting the Shummaries. The latter were defeated, and the Kaseem people 'captured Ibn Rashid’s tents and whatever they found. When they were returning after capturing the tents, they saw some horsemen belonging to Ihn Rashid in pursuit of Ibn Saood. A severe fight took place between themfrom 10^ hours after sunrise till 2 hours after sunset. At first, a cavalry charge took place, and Saleh-el-Zewamel came forward. When they got mixed up, the horses became useless. When Majed-el-Hammond came forward, Saleh-el-Zewamel fired three shots at him, hut they missed him. Zahin-el-Khaled, who was alongside of Saleh, attacked Majed and killed him. Majed’s brother, Saood, came forward with 15 horsemen, but they If were also killed. The flags got mixed up. Our flag-bearers were killed, viz., Abdul Sakiri, Abdulla-bin-Hasan, and Kabandi. After the flag-bearers were killed, Saleh-el-Zewamel took up the flag, and put it up on the flag of the soldiers (Turkish?) and broke it (the soldier’s flag). They were defeated. Of the soldiers, 800 were killed; also 200 of the Hyel people, When Ibn Eashid was defeated, the Kaseem people began to enquire about Ibn Saood, but could not find time. He had fled, leaving Kaseem on his left. They then sent men to the Aneiza people,, and wrote a letter to Ibn Saood, inducing him to come, but he did not reply. They wrote him a second time and sent the letter by Mujahed-el-Heberdi. When the latter reached Aneiza, he saw Ibn Saood, but he (Ibn Saood) did not wish to return. They (the Kaseems) waited at Bukeiriyeh for the night, and no one turned up, even though they remained there till the forenoon of the next day. They had with them 6 guns and 160 soldier prisoners, whom they had captured from Ibn Bashid, and whom they did not kill. They spiked the guns. They then left Bukeiriyeh and came to Aneiza. Some men belonging to Ibn Saood were present at the time the fight took place between the Kaseems and Ibn Eashid, and saw how Ibn Eashid was defeated. These men were sent to Ibn Saood with a letter bearing 30 seals of the Kaseems. They found Ibn Saood at Murreba, and brought him with them. W T hen he reached Kaseem, 1,600 men came forward from Aneiza and 2,000 men from Boreida to join him. They came forward this time not as they did the last. They left Kaseem three hours before the Kossid left to come to our side. They were bound for Bukeiriyeh, and thence for the place where Ibn Eashid was. May God help them and destroy their enemies ! I intended to send Abdul Ali’s son to you, but Sheikh Mubarak ordered him to go to Nejd with the ammunition, partly supplied by himself, and partly ordered by the Aneiza people. Foreiga Office Pfess- Ko. 931—25.8.04—64Extract from the Diary of the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia for the week ending 8th August 1904. * ****** I have received the following from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, under date 30th July 1904 :— “ Since early in June, there have been disturbances near Amarah similar to those of last November at the same place. The Wall left Basrah for Amarah on the 3rd July, taking with him 100 soldiers. It would appear that the disturbances had by that time assumed serious proportions, and that many Arabs had been killed and wounded, hut not by Turkish troops. About 300 of the latter had come from Baghdad. Sadun Pasha, the Muntafik, is said to have come on the scene, to have in June surrounded and disarmed some 150 of those Turkish soldiers, to have on or about 2nd July been heavily defeated by the Turks and to have escaped by flight and disappeared, and to be now raiding near Nasarieh. But all tbis about Sadun Pasha is contradicted by persons who should be well informed, and who declare that he never came on the scene at all. About a month ago, that is shortly before the Wall left Basrah, the * Alous ’, described as a Government revenue boat, appears to have either shelled or fired on Arabs of the Ghadban party ; some say that Arabs were killed, while others who should be well informed but are perhaps interested declare that there was only a blank discharge from the e Alous ’. The Wali seems to have patched up a truce among the Arabs, but disturbances are probably recom mencing. The Wali remains at Amarah. An unofficial report has just reached me of a great victory of Abdul Aziz ibn Saud over Ibn Rashid and the Turks near Boreida.” ******* ► forein Office Press—2To, 1088—7-9-04—54.12 'Extract from the Diary of the Folilical Resident in Turkish Arabia for the week ending the Ibth August 1904. * % August IQth .—It is reported that the Yali has received a telegram from Osman Pasha of Medina to the following effect:— Ibn Rashid has hilled the Meer Alai (Commander) of the troops sent to assist him against Ibn Sand because he refused to March the troops in front of Ibn Rashid’s Arabs. Ibn Rashid then ordered Bimbashi Ramzan Agha (the 2nd-in-command) to march the troops in advance of his Arabs, and during a fight with Ibn Sand’s Arabs, Ibn Rashid’s Arabs fired at the troops, killing 100 and wounding 90. Among the killed were Bimbashi Ramzan Agha, a Captain of Artillery, and 19 Zabats (Lieutenants). It is said that the Yali is doing his utmost to suppress this news. He admits that the Turks lost heavily in an engagement with Ibn Sand, but states that Ibn Saul was eventually defeated and had to beat a retreat. (Sent to Embassy, Constantinople). Fr )m— Major, P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. I have just received a long letter from Captain Cox, in which he reports as follows fro n circumstantial statement furnished by Sheikh Mubarak :— Begins. The Turkish Government who realize that Bin Rashid’s power is waning have devised a scheme for recognising Bin Stud as ruler of Nejd under Turkish protection, but have made a promise of immunity from direct Turkish interference. To this end overtures to Sheikh Mubarak are being made by Agents of the Yali of Basrah to the effect that both he and Bin Saud will be liberally rewarded with titles and otherwise if he will use his influence to induce Bin Saud to accept such r.n arrangement. Mubarak is altogether opposed to suggestions made and says that any present acknow ledgment of Turkish sovereignty in (Nejd) will inevitably end in the absorp tion of the whole country by the Turks. He adds that Bin Saud is a Bedouin, and that he, Mubarak, could not trust him if he allied with the Turks, although he is strong friend with him now.— Ends. On rejection by Mubarak of these overtures the Vali will, doubtless, communicate direct with Bin Saud. It seems just possible that the Turkish scheme may be the result of some arrangement (with) His Majesty’s Government. If so, I beg Telegram No. 2965-E.A., dated the 9th September 190±. From—The Foreign Secretary, Simla, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Please refer to your telegram 5th September.

VVe have no reason to believe that His Majesty s Government have countenanced any such arrangements as those reported to have been suggested by emissaries of the Yali of Basrah arrangements^ which, so far as concerns Koweit, would obviously be opposed to past policy in t at quarter to allow. * Telegram, dated Bushire, the 5th September 1901. * Recognise P that I may be * informed ? {sic), and res pectfully urge that it would be very short sighted policy to acquiesce in such au arrangement. 'n o. i ^ Bushire.Extract from the Diary of the Political Pendent in Turkish Arabia for the week ending the 29th August 1904. ******* I have received the following news from the British Vice-Consulate Karbala under date 25th August 1904 :— “ Baring the past few days news prevailed here that Ibn Saud, the great Amir of Nejd, against whom, and in support of his opponent, the Amir of Jabal Shammar, Turkey had sent troops, was killed and his Arabs totally de feated. This news became public talk here, and I heard the sarae from the Mutessarif who also added that the Sultan had issued an Trade for the bestow al of a silver medal to each of the soldiers engaged, and a gold medal, with promotion of one degree, to each of their officers. “ Whilst the Turks and the people were joyously handling this news, there were others who denied their statements and believed that the case was alto gether different, and that this rumour was purposely invented by the Turks either for some political intention or to conceal their misfortune. I asked the Mutessarif if the Government has posted soldiers in those places which were taken from Saud for the sake of their better protection: he said no, they were left to the entire care of the Amir of Jabal Shammar who is the trustee and the representative of the Sultan there. “ Yesterday afternoon we suddenly heard that the conquerors were ^re turning to Karbala on their way to Baghdad with the head of Ibn Saud. A very great agitation was set amongst the people who went out in hundreds to receive them. A number of Zaptiehs and some low officials were also sent. After half an hour I saw from the roof of the Vice-Consulate about ten Arabs riding on darnels and each carrying a banner. These Arabs were surrounded and followed by the Zaptiehs and the multitude who had gone out to meet them and most of their banners had many holes in them. The largest of these which was carried in front of all and bore the Turkish Crescent and Star with the writing of “ La Ilaha ilal Lah Mohamadur Rasool-Ullah ” on one side and “Nasrum min Ullah wa Kathun Kareeb wa Bashshir-il-Moomineen ” on the other was said to belong to Ibn Saud. They all had red and white margins and green grounds with brass top globes surmounted by short iron spears. The bearers, who were the Arabs of Ibn Rashid, were taken direct to the Municipa lity where the Mutessarif and other Turkish officials received them very kindly. “ The banners, which they claimed to belong to the defeated enemy, were posted round the Municipality compound when a preacher got up and in the presence of the multitude delivered a long speech which ended with pravers for the Sultan of Turkey. “ This is all that was witnessed here in consequence of the claimed victory. There were neither heads nor any other small things showing that they have really been victorious. Besides, the troops sent by Turkey are not known where they have ended, and had this victory been true, at least some of them ought to have returned with these flags in order to make their arrival more showy and imposing to the public. “ However, flying news are very much about Ibn Saud that he was either killed, captured or his left hand blown off by a shell and thereby entirely defeated. r ihe Sheikh of Koweit is said to have died of cholera.

No. 4, dated the 8th August 1904. From— Captain S. G. Knox, His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent Koweit, To —Major P. Z. Cox., C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to address you on the subject of a site for the house of the Political Agent at Koweit. 2. On Sunday morning, the 7th instant, Sheikh Mubarak took me round to inspect the house he has selected for me to live in for the present. I believe that the Sheikh has done his best for me, but a very brief inspection of the house sufficed to convince me that it was quite unfitted for the permanent residence of a European. Towards the sea, it looks out on a ship-building yard, with a very unpleasant smell of tallow. On all the other three sides, it is shut in by insanitary surroundings. The space the building covers is also far too con fined for the purposes for which it is required. 3. I inspected another and larger house at present occupied by the Agent of Messrs. Gray^Paul &amp; Co; but this, though larger, is shut in on all four sides, and would need very expensive alterations before it could be in any way rendered fit for a Political A*gency. At the best, the place would be hot and insanitary. 4. On Sunday afternoon, I rode round the entire town. I had thought at first that the best position would be at the east end of the town. The difficulty, however, in that direction is that the water is shallow, and at low tide there is a lono* stretch of sand and slime which one would have to cross before em barking even in a small boat. The foundation on which one would have to build appears to be all sand. : 5. Returning home by the western end of the town, I came upon what appears to me to be incomparably the best site for the new house. 6. I have taken a few rough measurements, and have draiVn a very rough sketch of the position. I trust that it will be found largely to explain itself. It seems to me that the Agency might well be built within the wailed enclosure in the north-east corner of the sketch, if necessary, including the 28 paces to the front. I think, however, that the enclosure itself would give plenty of room for a house with private servants’ houses on the east, while the front portion, 28x'a0 paces, might be filled up to the house level and reserved for promenade and flagstaff. 7. I think there will be quite enough water for a boat-house in the bend on the west of the walled enclosure. 8. The small rectangular plateau would be an excellent site for a dispensary, telegraph or post office, and to prevent encroachments or building in, I would propose to acquire a continuous stretch of land, including the plateau right up to the sea front. The total area I estimate to be about 5 acres. A rough idea of the boundry is indicated by * * *. 9 Land to the west of the property will be somewhat expensive to reclaim, and this would have the effect of discouraging intending builders, while, at the same time, I do not think the expense would be prohibitive, in case, at any time, Government wished to acquire more land.10. Clerks’ quarters, quarters for the guard and menials, and stabling could all be built in the ground lying between the plateau and the Agency. H This property lies about a mile away from Sheikh Mubarak’s bouse, and is no great distance from the bazaar. 1?. The position of the Agency ensures its lying open to the sea on the north and west, whence the prevailing winds blow. Merchants warehouses, which are infinitely to he preferred to bazaar slums, lie on the south and east. 13 It will he necessary to acquire by purchase the walled enclosure which is the property of a merchant. I have instructed Af?ha Muhammad Khalil to make enquiries, and I hope soon to he able to have a definite proposal to make as to its cost. 14. All the rest of the ground is at present lying waste and unreclaimed, and it will he necessary to approach the Sheikh with a view to its acquisition. He has been good enough to appoint to-morrow for its inspection, and I do not anticipate many difficulties in inducing him to part with it. It would, however, no doubt strengthen my hands, if you, Sir, would be so good as to wnte to Sheikh Mubarak, informing him that I have reported to you that _ there is no available suitable house for the permanent residence of the Political Agent; that accordingly it will he necessary for the British Government to build a house and to acquire a site for the purpose; and that you trust he will afford me every assistance with that end in view. 15. The Sheikh himself volunteered the information that he has been giving away large plots of waste land to encourage settlers. I venture to think that the Government of India would, perhaps, prefer not to lie under any obligation to him in this matter, and would be ready to give a reasonable price for such land as they require. At the same time, the Sheikh’s recent conduct, alluded to above, will, it is to he hoped, prevent him from asking an unconscion able price. 16. I have thought it best not to delay this letter until I am in a position to put forward more definite proposals, as I have a present opportunity of sending it on, which, owing to the lack of postal facilities, may not occur again for some time. I hope that any subsequent proposals as to cost of purchase will be of such a nature that they can he easily embodied in a telegram which, with this letter, will enable the Government of India to decide the question. 17. I may add that I have consulted Mr. Khalil, and we are both of the opinion that an outside price for the entire site, including the enclosure, would be Rs. 2,000. I hope to get it for considerably less; but, if the Government of India would he pleased to entrust me with the negotiations, subject to a limit of Rs. 2,000,1 would venture to ask that their decision might be communicated to me by telegram, and I shall use every endeavour to secure as good a bargain as possible.

I do not see any one else who entertains so much good feelings towards you as myself.

Till now, however, I have not received relief from your Government as to the losses which I suffer at the hands of the Turks in connec tion with my property and subjects, and all this without any cause and only on account of my friendship for you. I still behave well with them, but it is all in vain. Notwithstanding this, although theirs is a big Government, I have done them favours as far as it lay in my power, both pecuniary and personal.

My friend, I am glad that you should express to me freely what is in your heart for it is bv the closer knowledge of your feelings and difficulties that we shall be able to help you more and more fully as time goes on, and no doubt this is the very purpose for which the British Government have arranged _ to send a representative to live in your territory and to be always at hand to give you advice and help. ^ ■ But you must endeavour to realise that it is better in your own interests that, when we assist you in your affairs with others, it should be as far as possible by friendly representations, and not by other means. I think it is especially the case of your Agent, who is in prison at Basrah, that is in your mind. I am not forgetting this matter, nor is my Government, and I will again write to them about it by this mail, and hope the result will be g 00 ^ With regard to other matters, Captain Knox will tell you what trouble we have taken here for your subjects, e.g., regarding Khalid, the Pilot, and various disputes between Koweit dhows and the Customs, and will not fail to help you in these matters to the best of our power. 0Tt# r /g (Confidential.) Erom To No. 2918 E.-A. The UNEER-SECKETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA in the Foreign Department^ Major P. Z. COX, c.i.e., POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Dated Simla, the 7th September 1904. Sir, I am directed to address you regarding the recently-created appointment of Political Agent at Koweit. 2. As notified in Foreign Department telegram No. 2457, dated the 3rd August 1904, Captain Knox will take up the appointment, but will so act as not to attract unnecessary attention. His first object should be to cultivate and maintain close and friendly relations with Sheikh Mubarak and the principal personages in Koweit. The interests of British trade and traders at Koweit and in the adjacent tracts of Arabia should be safeguarded, and a vigilant watch kept over the proceed ings^ of the Turks on the boundaries of . Koweit territories. Matters tending to show an intention, on the part of the Turks\ or any other Power, to interfere with, or disturb, the existing status quo or anything which would lead to a belief that any other Powers have\ designs on, or in connection with, possible harbours within or without Koweit territory should at once be reported. Special regard in this respect should be paid to Khor Abdulla\ and the waters round Bubiyan Island and Um Kasr, but Captain Knox should be careful not to display undue apprehension or uneasiness on this point, or, in default of definite instructions, to interfere actively in matters affecting these places. 3. Any attempt on the part of the Turks, or others acting from Turkish territory, to encroach on or beyond the limits of Hejeje'f^ and Subhielf| should be forthwith reported. Captain Knox should, however, endeavour to ascertain if these places really represent the bounds of Shiekh Mubarak’s effective occupation at present. 4. He should further endeavour to secure early and accurate information regarding the struggle between the Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud families for the supremacy of Nejd. His Majesty’s Government have^' instructed Sir Nicolas O’Conor to inform the Turkish Government that, as repeated warnings have been given to the Sheikh of Koweit against participating in any insurrection ary movement, they have a right to expect that the Porte will use their bestendeavours to restrain the Amir of Nejd from embarking on a course of action thick mUt endanger the peace in those regions, and the Ambassador has wmcn migub eg 1 been further requested to express the hope,* in regard to the assistance given to Ibn Rashid, that the Turkish Government will avoid taking any action which mio’ht still further add to the disturbed condition of this part of Arabia, the tranquility of which is a matter of interest to His Majesty’s Government as well as to that of the Sultan. In connection with this question I am to forward, for your information, a copy of the marginally noted correspond- Telegram from Secretary of State, dated the 8th re g ar ^i n g proposals to obtain more Fe D?sp r a y tch 9 to secretary of state, No. 69, dated the reliable information regarding the situa tion in the interior of Arabia. 5. The Government of India also desire to be furnished-^ with inform ation regarding the trade in arms with Koweit, and how far, if at all, arms are being especially imported through Koweit for Ihn SauA Pending further instructions, the Political Agent should| neither authorise nor forbid Sheikh Mubarak to continue the trade which ^already exists. I have the honour to be, Sik, Your most obedient servant, C. L. S. RUSSELL, Under-Secretary to the Government of India, Foraign Office I’rcsg—No, 1097—7-9-04—44, Yw e t No. 300, dated Bushire, the 3rd September 1904. From Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram of 24th August, regarding proposed house accommodation for our Agency at Koweit, I have the honour to report that Captain Knox, writing informally after despatch of his letter No 4 of 8th instant, informed me that Sheikh Mubarak was now anxious that we should take another site, which he considered a more desirable one than that first The Political Agent agrees that, in several respects, the position now sug^est- ed has advantages over the one originally proposed. He will report further on it omcially. *- _ . 2 : th c meanwhile, he enquires whether it would be possible to get an official of the I ublic Works Department up to Koweit, for a few days, to advise him on certain point, and to draw up plans and estimates. * n thls coniiect i on I suggest that the Overseer, now in charge of the Maskat building work, may be deputed. He is a capable man, and has now gained exeperience of local conditions and rates; and I imagine that the Executive Engineer, Indus Eight Bank Division, would make no difficulty about sending him up. &amp; I think it might be advisable, however, to delay his deputation until the Government of India have been able to decide finally regarding the deputation of a doctor and a Postmaster to Koweit as a permanent measure. 3. Meanwhile it is necessary to make some temporary arrangements for Captain Knox’s comfort and accommodation, and to this end I beg that his letter No 7, dated 17th instant, may receive favourable consideration, and that the provisional arrangements made by Captain Knox may be approved, and sanc tion accorded for the expenditure of the Rs. 1,000 required to carry out the necessary alterations to his temporary quarters. No 7, dated the 17th August 1904. From—C aptain S. G. Knox, Political Agent at Koweit, To —Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the the honour to forward herewith, for your information, the copy of a translation of the lease I have entered into for the house I propose to occupy until a suitable Agency can be built at Koweit. 2. The terms of the lease are, I venture^to think, exceptionally favourable, though a little unusual, and I trust that you will be so good as to recommend it to the Government of India for favour of approval. 3. The rent is very low—only Es. 20 per mensem—but, before the house could be rendered fit for habitation, I have found it necessary, in anticipation of santion, to authorise Agha Muhammad Khalil to carry out certain repairs and additions. A sum of Es. 650 has already been spent, and it is estimated that the total expenditure on the house will amount to Es. 1,000. 4. I would solicit the favour of your assistance in obtaining the sanction of the Government of India to the advance of this sum, which will be repaid to Government in such monthly payments of rent as they see fit to impose. 5. The house, when completed, will contain four large rooms with one large and one small godown on the ground floor; on the first floor, there will be three rooms. Of the rooms on the ground floor, two large rooms will be used exclu sively for public purposes; one will be the office, and one will be a room for the entertainment of Arab visitors. Of the rooms on the first floor, one will be my own office. The rest of the house will be used for private accommodation only of myself and my personal servants.6. Rs. 20 per mensem will not, of course, represent the fall letting value of the house after the money, which I propose Government should put into it, has been spent thereon. But perhaps, in view of the fact that nearly quarter of the accommodation has been appropriated to public uses, it will he consider ed sufficient if I pay to Government a monthly rent of Rs. 20 until the sum of Rs. 1,000 has been repaid, and after that to the owner. 7. It will probably be objected that, long before the advance to Govern ment is repaid (namely before the expiry of four years), a suitable Agency will have been built, and the owner of the house will reap the benefit of what I may call tenant’s improvements, and Government will be a loser of, say, half the sum advanced. 8. I do not, however, anticipate any such contingency. If the Political Agent can be suitably accommodated elsewhere, it will no doubt be practicable to use the building as a Post Office, with Postmaster’s quarters above, still at this exceptionally low rental. Its comparatively central position in the town makes it specially adapted for the purpose indicated above. 9. After the advadce made by Government has been fully repaid, it will probably be advisable to review the terms of the lease, if Government still requires the house and to allow a higher rental. As the terms of the lease contemplate its being at the disposal of the Political Agent for ever at^ a rate of Rs. 20 per mensem, we shall be in an exceptionally favourable position to treat, if the landlord is inclined to be exhorbitannt. We are always at liberty to fall back on the original lease or to cancel it as seems most convenient. In fact, any higher rental would be an act of grace on our part, though 1 think such a concession would be advisable in the future, for I doubt if the lessor intended to be strictly bound by the terms of the lease in perpetuity, they would allow us to go on improving the house for ever without the owner reaping the benefit of one farthing by our occupation. 10. It may be as well for me to place on record the fact that the terms of the lease were arranged by Sheikh Mubarak, and only submitted to me for approval. I did not think it incumbent on me to oppose them, when the owner appeared perfectly satisfied. 11. I trust it will not be considered that I have gone beyond my powers in authorising the expenditure of so large a sum of money in anticipation of sanction. I have already been staying in Sheikh Mubarak’s house for 11 days, and it will probably be another week brfore I can take up my new quarters. Although this trespass or his hospitality was inevitable and even at first advis able as a means of establishing close and friendly relations from the beginning, I felt very strongly that I should outstay my welcome, if I prolonged my resi dence in his house one day longer than was necessary. The delay which would have been caused in obtaining sanction would have been great, and I trust that this explanation will be found sufficient to excuse the unusual step I have taken. 12. It may be noted that this arrangement does away with the necessity of the grant of Rs. 50 per mensem proposed for the rent of office by yourself in the letter with which you submitted to the Government of India the estimates for the expenditure of the Koweit Political Agency. 13. It only remains for me to point out that there is no stabling accom* modation whatever attached to this house, either for my own horses or for those of any escort it may be decided to furnish me with. A convenient plot of ground that I propose to treat for adjoins my new quarters. This matter, however, does not press, and all leases and expenditure connected therewith will be submitted to you for sanction in due course before they are entered into.

The Sheikh at once produced a letter from his Basrah Agent, from which it appeared that the second instalment of £2,000 had been paid.

I regret to find from your telegram No. 2965 E.-A. of yesterday’s 1 date that 1 had overlooked the papers sent me with Foreign Department endorsement, No, 23.65 E.-A., dated 26th July. They had left me to be copied for the Political Agent at Koweit, to whom copies were sent, and owing to press of work had not been returned to the file. 3. When communicating with you, I had the drift of Sir N. O’Conor’s views in my mind, and thought it might possibly be now contemplated to give; the Turks a free hand with Bin Saud, and to endeavour to restrict ourselves to our relations with Sheikh Mubarak. No. 18, dated the 3rd September 1904). From— Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to inform you that I have just returned from a long and interesting conversation with Sheikh Mubarak about affairs in Nejd. The communications he made appear to me important, and 1 take the oppor tunity of noting them down while they are still fresh in my memory. 2. The Sheikh has learnt that the Wali of Basrah, on the 25th August, received a telegram from the Porte, in which it is said that it appears that Bin Saud’s affairs are progressing, while Bin Rashid’s power is weakening, and Bin Rashid is asking for more help. The telegram concludes by calling on the Wali of Basrah for his opinion on the situation. 3. It further appears that the Wali of Basrah has replied to the effect that he sees no necessity for the appointment of a Mutasarrif at Nejd, and volunteers to make Bin Saud ruler of Nejd in the name of the Turks. The above information was received in a private letter to Sheikh Mubarak from Agha Jafir, Agent of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Com pany, who is said to be the Wali’s most trusted and confidential adviser. 4. ApparentlV) in pursuance of this intention, the Mali approached, first, Saiyid Rajab, the Nakib of Basrah, and secondly, Agha Jafir, mentioned above, an/asked them to write privately on behalf of the Wall to Sheikh Mubarak, and to suggest that he should advise Bin Saud as follows : « That he should write to the Mushir of Baghdad to say_ that Bin Rashid had brouoht soldiers into Nejd, that the people had risen against them and that Bin Saud alwavs a faithful servant of the Sultan had taken the soldiers under his protection, that there was no need of Turkish soldiers m i e 3 d &gt; ■Rin Sand was readv to execute the Sultan s commands, and that the soldiers fhouU be withdrawn, and that he (Bin Saud) would send them safely wherever directed”. , 5 The writer of this letter to Sheikh Mubarak was authorised to promise, as a return for Bin Saud’s letter, the establishment of Bin Sand as ruler of Neid under Turkish protection, hut without Turkish interference in the shape of soldiers and officials. He. was also to promise rewards and titles for both Sheikh Mubarak and Bin Saud. _ . . w ,. , ' 6 The Sheikh is of the opinion that this proposal of the Wall w Bin Saud^and himself was inspired from Constantinople, and that the Turkish authorities approve the Wali s policy.7. However, Saiyid Rajab and Agha Jafir began to make excuses, and declined to assist the Wali who was forced to look elsewhere for a man to write to Sheikh Mubarak. He selected Abdul Hamid Effendi, the Sheikh’s Agent, who said that he was ready to obey the Wall’s orders, but thought it extremely ^ unlikely that Sheikh Mubarak would take any notice of such a communication especially coming from a man of no importance like himself, a mere man of business. The Wali was, therefore, again in difficulties but, none the less, all three persons have written, each on his own account and ostensibly without the knowledge of the Wali, to Sheikh Mubarak, informing him that the Wali had approached them with this proposal. The letters reached the Sheikh about the 28th August. 8. At this point, I remarked that it seemed to me extremely likely that the Wali, having failed to induce Sheikh Mubarak to write, would com municate his offers direct to Bin Saud which he could do without difficulty. The Sheikh agreed, and added that this was exactly what he feared. 9. I then said to the Sheikh that, while it would be impossible for him to make any such communication to Bin Saud without the full knowledge and approval of the British Government, it occurred to me that, in certain circum stances, it might be possible that Government might direct him to suggest that Bin Saud should make his peace with the Turks on the condition of retaining his independence at the price of a merely nominal acknowledgment of the Sultan’s suzerainty. 10. I took special care to impress on the Sheikh that, in all this, I spoke without the authority of my Government and with the very incomplete knowledge of a newcomer, and that I was merely anxious to learn his views on a possible solution of the Nejd difficulty. 11. I said that it might be argued that the British interest in Nejd was merely subsidiary, that while I understood that the British Government was firmly resolved to maintain the independence of Koweit, and could not tolerate the presence of a powerful enemy of Sheikh Mubarak at its gates, it might be disposed to regard with comparative indifference the fact that the ruler of Nejd owned allegiance to the Porte, provided that that ruler was friendly to Sheikh Mubarak, and was in no danger of being forced or cajoled into hostilities against Koweit by the Turks or by anyone else. 12. It seemed unlikely that Bin Saud could, without outside assistance, maintain himself in Nejd, that he would never apply for Turkish help which would mean his own downfall as a matter of course in a short time, and that he would be obliged to turn to his old friend and ally Mubarak in every difficulty. J 13. This view of the position however did not satisfy the Sheikh. He said that he ^vas afraid that the acknowledgment of Turkish suzerainty would mean only the beginning of the absorption of Nejd, and he added expressions which seemed to show that he could not trust Bin Saud, especially linked with the Turks. He repeated over and over again that Bin Saud was a Beduw meaning apparently that he was on this side to-day, on the other to-morrow 14. It is no secret that, despite Sheikh Mubarak’s assurances, Bin Saud has been and continues to be supported in the main by the Sheikh of Koweit. Small supplies of food, arms, and ammunition proceed to the interior almost weekly, and his Munshi, Abdulla, who enjoys his complete confidence, though the Sheikh tolerates no adviser, complained the other day to the Residency interpreter that “ the Sheikh had poured out money in the interior like water and God alone knew what would be the end of it all ”. * 15. On the other hand, apart from British support, Mubarak’s power and prestige depend almost entirely on the Bedouins. He supplies monev and arms, while they furnish the men to push his schemes and keep dan4r at a distance. An interesting detail is that Sheikh Mubarak styles himself 0 in hi correspondence with the Turkish authorities “ ruler of Koweit and head of the tribes thereof ”. 1110 Foreign Offica Press—No. 1274—20-9-04—54Memorandum No. 141-S.

From—The Director-General^ Post Office, To—The Foreign Department, I think it right to submit, for the information of Government in the foreign Department, the accompanying copy of a letter which I have received from the Karachi Merchants’ Association. In reply I have informed the Association that arrangements have been made for the opening of a post office at Koweit, hut that there is no present likelihood of a post office being opened at Dahoi.

I am directed by my Association to bring to your notice that although almost every important port in the Persian Gulf has a post office, the ports of Dahoi and Koweit, which are also becoming centres of trade with India, have none. The British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers have now been calling at these ports every fortnight, but in the absence of post office, merchants have to send their letters and shipping documents through passsengers or their friends at other ports, the result being that they reach very irregularly or some times not reach at all. You are well aware that the very first and the most important factor in trade is the postal arrangement without which it is almost impossible to develop© it to any great extent. My Association, therefore, request that you will be good enough to give this matter your kind consideration and arrange to open post office at the above named ports so that business arrangements w r ith these places may he greatly facilitated.* No. 311, dated Bushire, tlie lOtli September 1904.

In continuation of my letter No. 257, dated 13th August 1904,1 have the „ , , honour to forward for the information of the Government or India a copy of the marginally noted letter, which I have received from the Political’Agent, Koweit, regarding the fighting at Nejd between the factions of Ibn Saood and Ibn Rashid. No. 14, dated Koweit, the 25th August 1904. From— Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward herewith the latest information I have re ceived of the fighting at Nejd between the factions of Bin Saood and Bin Rashid. 2. It will probably he found advisable to divide the numbers given for Bin Saood’s forces by ten to arrive at a just appreciation of his fighting strength, but I think there is no doubt that Sheikh Mubarak believes in the truth of these latest reports. 3. As a proof of this, I may mention that, last night, he said that he was quite willing to send me to Nejd if I wished to go and to hold himself abso lutely responsible for my safety. I venture to think that he would not say this unless he were sure that the Bin Saood party was in the ascendant. 4. I made the suggestion merely as a test of his belief in the correctness of the Nejd reports. He said that I could, travelling rapidly, go and return within 14 days. 'Report. I have questioned very closely an old Bedouin who has come from the parts where fighting is going on. He seems more intelligent than the majority. He is named Mithaay bin Hodba Rashidi. He has come straight from Abdul Aziz bin Saood in Russ which he left exactly seven days ago. He has some idea of making a rough drawing in sand and from him I have elicited that rough sketch which accompanies this report. The position briefly is this : 700 Turkish soldiers, not all fully armed, with one working gun, are shut up in the deserted village of Shanajnah which has no houses nor cultivation, only a few wells. Mithaay reports that half the Turkish soldiers have died or been killed, and that the one gun is all that remains serviceable of the 5 guns they started with The soldiers have food with them and Ibn Rashid s men draw their supplies from the village of Nahhania two hours from Ibn Rashid's encamp ment. Ihn Rashid (force ?) (sic) with some Hail citizens extends away to the South of the fortification. His Bedouins lie in the rear of Ibn Rashid s front line. The army of Abdul Aziz bin Saood lies all along the eastern line of the sketch closing the road to Aneyza and Boreyda. It is said to he 10,500 infantry strong with 1,800 horse. The road to the north of Hail is closed by the Beni Aghail, 500 foot. The road lies open on the South and West. On the south the caravan road to Mecca and on the west the Beni Haib. In both these directions retreat is unlikely and would he extremely dangerous. 01. C. Press, Simla.— No. 2067 P.

August 12th, 1904 .—Beporfcs received in Koweit are to the effect that Ibn Saood’s following cannot face the Turkish troops and guns, but they have met with some success in cutting up outposts. Ibn Rashid issued a proclamation to the effect that the Sultan of Turkey had directed him to slaughter all the followers of the Wahabi chieftain. This has resulted in a great accession to the strength of Ibn Saood which was rather ou the wane. The Turkish soldiers with Ihn Rashid, whose expenses he pays, are esti mated at 2,500 men. Ibn Rashid, it is said, has so far made no use of his Shummar tribesmen, probably because he thought the Turkish soldiers would be more useful. 7. August 15th, 1904 .—News from Nejd reports another successful foray of the Ibn Saood faction. Ibn Rashid is reported to have left the neighbour hood of A1 Rass, i.e., Shanaynah, and to be proceeding northwards in the direction of Hail, keeping the Jabal Abenat on his left. It is reported that the Turkish troops are suffering severely from thirst. Koweit. 11. August 20th, 1904 .—Sheikh Mubarak showed the Political Agent a letter from Abdul Aziz, eldest son of Abdul Rahman-bin-Saood. The letter was a short one, but the writer is hopeful, says that he has reached Russ and that his strength increases every day, while that of Ihn Rashid decreases. He adds that Abn Rashid’s own friends are cursing him. 13.

I find the following article in Al-Ahram, dated the 16th September 1904 Arabia. From our special correspondent at Muscat. It is now established that Ibn-i-Rashid has been defeated and Ibn-i-Saood has gained victory. But the report about the death of Ibn i-Rashid is false; also is the report of Ibn i-Saood capturing six guns of the Turkish troops untrue. Ibn-i-Saood captured only one gun, while the remaining guns had been rendered useless by the Turkish troops. The most important thing is that the Sheikh of Koweit has given up his neutrality and has openly taken protection of the English. You have heard that Mubarak Ibn-i-Sabah sent a telegram to the Sublime Porte, intimating that if the Turkish troops did not abstain from helping Ibn-i- .Rashid then he would assist Ibn-i-Saood, and seek protection of a foreign power, who would protect him from all harm. He further added in the telegram that Foreign powers desire to extend their protection to the Arab Amirs, but the latter prefer to remain subjects of His Majesty the Sultan. But the Sublime Porte did not send him a reply. Consequently Mubarak sought protection of the English who have been trying to gain this object for four years past. On the 8th April 1993, Mr. Balfour stated in the House of Commons, that the Steikh of Koweit had entered into special agreements with the Eng lish. But the Sheikh repudiated this statement and said that he was subject to the Sublime Porte. And now he has since two weeks openly renounced bis allegiance to the Sultan, and has permitted a British Consul to reside at Koweit. The English have also established a post office there; and the Consul is now endeavouring to open a small dispensary for the treatment of the poor Arab sick freely. In this way the English have got their footing and flag fixed in Koweit, which is Turkish territory by the consent of Sheikh Mubarak. Koweit is the key of Arabia in the Persian Gulf. It is key of Irak, and the territory between the two rivers, as the roads lead easily and without obstacles to the interior of Irak from Koweit. In addition to this, Mubarak is on friendly terms with the Sheikhs who reside along these roads. Mubarak has been helping all the Sheikhs for a distance of 500 miles, who break out into rebellion, and he sup plies them with arms and ammunition and other supplies they want. All what he requires comes from India, and if it was not for the help of Mubarak the said Arabs would not be able to rebel for want of supplies. Mail steamers call once a week at Koweit via Muscat; and the Koweit merchants ship every week hundreds of rifles and ammunition, etc., to Koweit. They have adopted a well-known practice, ».e., they write on the cases containing firearms “cases containing sweetmeats ”; and those holding cartridges, “ dried limes. ” The customs officials at Muscat do not inquire about the contents of the cases, while the English officers, who last year made such a noise, when they found a Frenchman carrying six revolvers, shut their eyes when these cases are concerned. The customs officials at Bushire once opened one of these cases and found fifty rifles in them, and a large number of cartridges. But the English Consul C 876 23came there and shut their mouths and pressed their hands, and prevented them from making further inspection of the cases, and the arms were restored to the owners, who took them over to Sheikh Mubarak. Thus Ibn-i-Saood obtains his arms from Koweit and the latter from the English ; and so the English are the agents, who supply the Arabs with arms. I know as a fact that, had not the English made a present of four guns to Mubarak, the latter would not have been able to capture Boreida, which is a strong position and considered in Arabia to be invincible. It is often that Mubarak has not to pay for these arms and ammunition, because if he had to do so, he would soon be reduced to poverty. A short time after this the English sent him a lakh of rupees. The Arab rebels cannot find a better help. You may remember that Sheikh Sa’dun bin Mansur, the Sheikh of the Muttafik tribe, attacked a detach ment of Turkish troops in December last, and then raided the suburbs of Basrah. When he feared retribution he took refuge at Koweit, and remained under the protection of English guns. After a few months he retuned to his place, but did not remain at peace. He plundered a Turkish Katila, and nothing w^as done to him. He is now residing in quiet and without any anxiety. The English have only one line of policy in this country, i.e., to incite the rulers to oppress the people, and then to offer aid to the oppressed people and gain their hearts. It were the English who pressed the Turkish Government to deal severely with Mubarak bin Sabah, to secure peace to the country, the commerce, and the Turkish and the English subjects. When the S blime Porte acted in accordance with the advice given by the English and began to bring pressure on Sheikh Mubarak, then they offered to protect Mubarak from the danger, and the latter with his tribesmen placed himself under the British protection. I warn the high officials of the Sublime Government in a loud voice, to be careful about the intrigues of the English in Irak, because they are now cast ing greedy eyes opon that fertile land watered by two streams. Irak excels Egypt in fertility ; and he who possesses this land gets hold of all commerce of the east from Anatolin, Arabia, India, the shores of China, Afghanistan, Tibet, Khiva, Burma and Siam. The scheme of the English is greater than what you suppose and dream. If you allow things to go on as before, you will see tomorrow that this young man, Ibn-i-S icod, will become more important than necessary, and more serious than you think. Then make use of artifice and not force, and seek aid of the Erench and Russians, in order to defend yourselves against this aggression; nothing else will prevent their intrigues. The first step has been taken by them, but you should prevent them from taking the second, before it could be said, “ the rent has increased beyond the ability of the mender. ” 5th October 1904. A.

At the same time, it is doubtful if the Sheikh’s report will he accepted, and I have the honour to request that a doctor may be sent from Bushire to inspect the port of Koweit and to report as requested by the Wali of Basrah. 3. I have acquainted Sheikh Mubarak with the fact that I am writing to you to ask for the services of a doctor for this purpose, and he has informed me that he consents freely to the action proposed by me. 4. If Captain Condon’s services cannot be spared, it would, I think, be quite feasible for Doctor Daud-ur-Rahman or some other available subordinate of the medical department to leave Bushire for Koweit by the slow mail that reaches Koweit on Thursday, 15th September. He might either return by the same steamer, or I would arrange to send him back by the first available opportunity. 5. If the Basrah local authorities accept such a report, two valuable advantages will have been gained :— (i) An indirect acquiescence by the Turks in our predominance in Koweit. (ii) Sheikh Mubarak will be impressed by the advantage to him and his people of a resident English medical man. {Translation). Dated the 24th Jamadi-ul-Akher (5th September 1904).

When that reaches them, quarantine ■will cease to be imposed on the environs of Koweit from Koweit to Basrah. My friend! qurantine has been to us a cause of delay in all our affairs and our produce, and of great expense to our subjects, and now we are writing to the Wali of Basrah a letter that the health of our town of Koweit is perfect, free from diseases and anxieties and clean.

The Wali says that, if he receives a certificate from a medical man that Koweit is healthy, quarantine will be removed. 3. The Sheikh is writing a report to that effect, but he has no doctor, and he asks me to write to you to help his report through. I have told him I will do this. 4. I am doubtful, if the Sheikh’s report will be accepted, and am sending a letter to the Besident, Bushire, by this mail, asking him to let us have a doctor to inspect the port and send a certificate. 5.

I forward this letter at once as it seems to me important that, if it should be deerded to post a doctor in Government service to Koweit his qualifications should be of a high order, and I would suggest the advisability of a reference to Constantinople, in order that hills of health, given bv that doctor, should be recognised by the Turkish medical authorities. ^ r, , v’ 1 recoUcct that, when I was in Basrah some ten years ago, Dr Dobbin, who then did the work of Government and of the British merchants at that place, informed me that he had taken the precaution of obtaining a deploma fi-om Constantinople, which he had found of great practical valued dealing with the Turkish Sanitary Authorities. I believe that in the cSe of doctors of any standing and well-known qualifications, such a diploma is Hrere formality after fees are paid.

The Agent of the Sheikh of Koweit went yester day morning to the “ Merlin ” with two corpses and three Turkish soldiers whom he had taken prisoners and whom he accuses of having committed the murders. The Commander of the “ Merlin ” naturally refused to receive them, and after an interview with the Kaimmakam he handed over the soldiers to him getting the Kaimmakam to send a boat. The Agent then went ashore with the corpses. Today I heard that more troops are coming to take the Koweit Agent in chains to Basrah. I am afraid there will he a fight. End of message. The “ Sphinx ” left Bushire this morning before the receipt of the above message in order to relieve the “ Merlin I have wired to Captain Kemp at Bao, suggesting that, if the report is correct and a fight is imminent, perhaps both vessels might, unless the “ Merlin ” is urgently required elsewhere, remain off Eao for a day or two. Captain Knox thinks that, if you approve, it would he well to give Mullah Mahomed, Agent of the Sheikh of Koweit, re fuge on board the “ Sphinx ” or “ Merlin ” if there appears to be any danger of his arrest. Captain Knox who was to go on Wednesday direct to Koweit will now leave on Thursday, the 13th October, for Eao by a fast steamer and will be transferred either to the “ Sphinx ” or to the “ Merlin/’ but will take no action without instructions. Please instruct the “ Merlin ” to drop Captain Knox at Koweit on her return to Maskat. The following message from the Council at Basrah has been repeated to the Commander of the “ Merlin” :— Begins. Have you heard of the incidents which took place yesterday at Pao ? If you have no objection, please inform the Commander of the “ Merlin.” I think that if the Agent of the Sheikh of Koweit is on board he should not be surrendered to the Turkish authorities.

I have come to know from the Russian Consul that, if you will send a man to speak with the Russian Consul and others of their statesmen travelling to their country in the Russian ship which came on the 1st Rajab=12th Sep tember 1904, certainly the Turkish Government is inclined for reconciliation, so that it will he willing that your town should return to its former condition with an increase in your pay, and the Russian and French Governments will be responsible for (the good faith of ?) the Ottoman Government for a small condition that you will permit them to appoint two Consuls for them in your town, as has been permitted to the English Government. As for the return of the vessel to its country, its journey from here will he after about 12 days. This was what was necessary to report to you and may you remain guarded and greeting.

Sib, I have the honour to report the following occurrence for your information, a brief statement of it having already been sent to you by telegram. Durin' the forenoon of the 10th instant Moola Mahomet, agent of the Sheikh Muharek, came alongside with two boats, in one of which were the dead bodies of a man and woman whom he said had been shot by ' nr is so ie rs&gt; three of whom he had as prisoners in the other boat which 7“ J' Arabs with rifles. As my interpreter was ashore I took him to the telegrap station where Mr. MeMeakin, the Superintendent, kindly interpreted his stow for me, and on his telling me that the alleged murders ha a en p his house, I at once informed him that I oouM take no notion in the matter and that he must turn the soldiers oyer to the Turkish authorities but m case he was afraid to take them in to the Kaimaka “ himself ; A^ personally and ask him to send off for them. I then sent him off to the ship, atthe same time sending orders that the soldiers were on no account to he taken on board the “ Merlin After some delay caused by my haying to wait for my interpreter during which considerable telegraphing went on between the Kai- makam and Basrah, I called on the Kaimakam and told him that three of his soldiers were held by Moola Mahomet in a boat alongside the ship, and that he was willing to turn them over to him if he sent for them, and that I had refused to have anything to do with them. At first he said that he would not send off as he had communicated with Basrah and was awaiting the Vali’s reply, then that Moola Mahomet must bring the soldiers ashore himself and turn them oyer to him; on my pointing out to him that I thought it very unlikely that Moola Mahomet would go to him, and that I had no authority to make him do so, and also that if he did not send for his men, I should, as soon as I returned on board, make the boat leave the ship, and I could not tell what would happen to them as they were prisoners to armed Arabs and within easy distance of the Persian shore, he said he would send off for them, this he did, also sending off an officer to receive them; this officer wanted also to see the dead bodies, this he was unable to do as the boat containing them had been sent away, but he was informed by the Staff Surgeon who had viewed them that they were those of a man and woman, both shot through their heads. On the arrival of Turkish boat the soldiers were turned over to it from the boat they were in, and the boat with the Arabs in it also left the ship. The Kaimakam has just visited ship and informed me that he had come by order of the Tali to thank me for getting the soldiers given up to him. I expect the “ Sphinx ” here tomorrow, and shall probably leave for Bah rein and Maskat on the i3th. I have, etc., (Sd.) P. GIBBONS, Commander and S. A. 0., Persian Gulf. J.

I have seen Mr. McMeakin, and so far as I can judge, all seems quiet here. I am told Mulla Muhammad is a match for anything that can be brought against him by the Turks, and is in no personal danger.

No. 48, dated 17th October 1904, From— Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent,, Koweit, To— Captain A. P. Trevob, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report for the information of the Resident that I returned to Koweit late in the evening of the 16th October. 2. In^the morning Sheikh Muharek at once came to visit me and gave me the following information regarding affairs in Nejd :— ec On the 16th Rajah—27th September, Ibn Rashid broke up his camp at Shanaynah and began to march. His object is not known but probably he commenced a retreat towards Hail. In the course of the second day’s march, Abdnl Aziz bin Saood fell upon him at Kasr bui Agazil and the result of the encounter is said to have been an utter rout. 550 Turkish soldiers were killed and 330 men of Hail and Bin Saood’s men took two days thoroughly to plunder the tents at Kasr bni Agazil. Three standards have reached Koweit. Bin Rashid is said to have been seen severely wounded and riding away from the fight, and his shattered party, such as he could keep together, made their retreat with the following transport:— 40 loading camels. 12 horses. 9 mules. ,, Sheikh Muharek says that the few remaining soldiers who did not die in the fighting will in all probability die of hunger and thirst in the desert. 3. This news reached Koweit on the morning of the 15th and I heard a rough version at Fao the same evening as I was on the point of starting, but the extreme difficulty of sending confidential telegrams from that place pre vented me from sending the news as soon as I could have wished. 4. Sheikh Mubarek concluded his account of what had happened at Nejd with the embarrassing question “ what am I to say to Bin Saood who wants to know whether he is to write to the Turk or not about this matter ?” 5. I replied that in the absence of instructions from my Government neither Mubarek nor I could give any advice to Bin Saood who must consult his own interests and act as he thinks best. 6. This news is evidently believed at Koweit where there are signs of great rejoicing at Bin Saood’s victory.No. 871, dated Baghdad, the 21th October 1904* ia Turkish Arabia and His I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India a copy of a despatch addressed by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople referring to the troops lately sent by the Ottoman Government to assist Ibn Eeshid of Jabal Shammar against Ibn Saoud. i2. I also attach herewith copy of a letter I wrote lately to the Military Attache at Constantinople. J With reference to my telegrams Nos. 47 of the 17th August and 48 of the 20th August, I have the honour to report that since then, so far as is known here, the two forces have remained without fighting; Ibn Eashid with the Turkish troops shut up in the village Shenana and Ibn Saoud shut up in the neighbouring town A1 Bass: nor has anything further been heard here of the alleged expedition of Turkish troops from Medina. The inaction of the Turkish troops seem to confirm the reports that they suffered heavily in July and that three of their guns were spiked or rendered permanently useless. I may say here that from all I have heard 1 do think that more than about 2,000 Turkish soldiers with six guns went to Nedjd. Officers here about the middle of September received from Baghdad privately a list of 13 names of officers killed on the expedition. The list consists of Hassan Sliukri Bey, Colonel in com mand of the expedition, two Majors, six Captains and four lieutenants. The list gives full particulars, namely names and ranks and regiments and is be lieved by the officers here to be authentic. It is said that at least half of the men have been killed or have died but I have no good evidence of this. About the beggiiming of September a bundle of letters seems to have been brought here from Zobeir, a town about an hour distant from Bashra, and are said to have been handed to the Vail. They are said to be from the Sheikh of Kowiet to Ibn Saoud and to be all unimportant except one in which there is a passage to the following effect. “ If you are not succeeding now do not despair. Bo not care for the Turkish soldiers. Beware of Bessam (a great friend of Ibn Beshid) he is a traitor.’* The meaning of the fist sentence as reported to me seems obscure. The Sheikh of Koweit stoutly denies the authenticity of this letter, and the whole story seems doubtful. I have not been able to get a copy nor to learn how or where it was intercepted, nor am I sure that it was ever shown to the Vali. From— Major L. S.

The versions of the affair given by the Turks and by Sheikh Mubarak’s Agent, Mulla Muhammad, are of course diametrically opposed to one another, and cannot be reconciled. It appears, however, that as the Sheikh has recalled his agent Mulla Mahammad, that he considers his agent at fault. 3. The withdrawal of this agent, I consider, deprives the incident of all political importance, and it is now merely an ordinary murder case, which will no doubt be dealt with by the local authorities in the usual course. I do not anticipate that any further trouble will he caused by the affair. No. 38, dated the 21st October 1904&lt;. ;F rom J. H. Monahan, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, To— Majoh P. Z.

With reference to telegraphic correspondence respecting the recent inci dent at Fao, I have the honour to transmit herewith a statement taken by Captain Knox and copy of a letter from me to him. The acting Vali now asserts that the Koweit agent himself killed the man and woman who were (says the acting Yali) his enemies. The acting Vali still threatens to arrest the agent. I think the agent should leave Fao for Koweit at once if he has not already done so. The story of the prematurely born child seems to me obscure. I have not seen the medical report of the Staff Surgeon^ of the “ Mer ^- Commander Kemp who is now at Fao with the “Sphinx, might no doubt obtain light on the subject. P. S .—The Sheikh of Koweit has written to the Nakib, the religious Chief of the Sunnis of Basrah, that he regrets the conduct of his agen will recall and punish him.

The Acting Yali threatens to send * force to arrest the agent, but gives me to understand that if he is removed from Pao he (the acting Yali) will be satisfied. The gravamen of the com plaint of the Turkish authorities against the agent is ostensibly that he caused the rescue from the robbers of a negro a well known roboer named Amir on the occasion in question. The Turkish authorities deny the whole story about the slain woman and child; though, of course, it is impossible for them to persist in denying the dead body of the woman shot through the head. if I; P u In any case the agent does not seem to be a fit and proper person to be in Fao, and his staying on there might cause serious and useless trouble. For one thing he is well known to be given to drink. I sent off the letter to the Sheikh in rather a hurry, aud did not think at the moment of writing to you which I suppose I should have done though not yet informed that you have got back to Koweit.

The information which I sent last mail about Mulla Muhammad being recalled from Fao, and having proceeded to Koweit was received by telegram from Pao, and is, I think, correct, although Captain Knox appeared to be unaware of it when he wrote. No. 49, dated the 21st October 19U4. p rom —Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, T 0 —Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E,, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to inform you that on my arrival at Pao, on the morn ing of the 15th instant, I proceeded to place myself in communication with Mulla Muhammad, Sheikh Mubarek's agent at Pao, as speedily as possible. 2. The Sheikh’s agent came alongside H.M.S. “Sphinx” about noon and I recorded his statement, of which a copy is forwarded herewith. It will be seen that he stated that he was in no personal danger; to ascertain this was the principal object of my visit to Pao, and from my conversation with tkfe agent and onr clerk in charge of the telegraph station at lao, I had no reason to apprehend any immediate recrudescence of the quarrel. 3 Bearing in mind the general tenor of my instructions as contained in Foreign Department Confidential letter No. 2918-E.A., to your address, dated the 7th September 1904, so to act as not to attract unnecessary attention, I did not consider it advisable to attempt a more minute enquiry into the parti culars of the Pao incident. Such an enquiry would have been difficult without infringing the Turkish quarantine regulations and would also, I conceived, have been somewhat beyond my province, as I understand Pao falls wit in the inrisdiction of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah. There seemed therefore to be no object in prolonging my stay there and I accordingly made preparations for my departure and left the same evening in a helium belonging to Sheikh Mubarek. 4 . I reached Koweit the next evening and on the morning of the 18th-- the Sheikh’s letter is misdated—I received a letter, extracts forwarded herewith* from the Sheikh in which he details, as far as is known to him, what took place at Pao. It is, perhaps, worthy of note that he explains away the action ot Mulla Muhammad in taking the corpsesjand the arrested soldiers t° ^e * I think there can be no doubt, from the telegrams first received, that Mulla Muhammad hoped that the Commander of H.M.S. “ Merlin would detain the soldiers on board if not imprison them, but the explanation now given is that he wished for the Commander s evidence to the outrage. 5. This view of the case was quite earnestly pressed upon me by Sheikh Mubarek at an interview this morning. He vehemently disclaimed any idea ot a wish, on the part of himself or his agent, to have the Turkish soldiers imprison ed by tbe Commander of the “Merlin .6. I am inclined to think this may he due to letters received hy the Sheikh from Basrah yesterday afternoon. In these letters, Mulla Muhammad informs the Sheikh that the British Consul at Basrah and an agent of His Excellency the Wali will reach Eao on Friday (today) to enquire into the outrage He also states that he received a message from the Consul at Basrah through the Clerk in Charge at Fao directing him to leave Fao for Koweit without delay, but that he hesitates to act on these instructions. 7 . Another letter from the Consul at Basrah to Sheikh Mubarek contains similar instructions, saying that it is advisable that Mulla Muhammad should he recalled to Koweit without delay, as the Wall’s Yakil is intensely annoyed with him, presumably for his action in taking Turkish soldiers to a British man-of-war. 8. Sheikh Mubarek was at first inclined to be angry with Mulla Muham mad for not at once obeying the Consul’s directions and last night he sent or ders recalling him at once. This morning, however, he was prepared to de fend his agent, alleging the importance of the interests committed to his charge. 9. As regards the general tone of the letter which may perhaps appear rather dictatorial and dissatisfied, I have pointed out to Sheikh Mubarek that he himself was the first to recognize that my appointment to Koweit would be the signal for a tighter squeeze—I use his own simile which he invariably accompanies by an expressive gesture—at the hands of the Turks ; that we are as yet only at the beginning of affairs and that he will do well to wait and see how they progress before becoming restive. 10. I also thought it necessary to enter a quiet protest against the caution contained in the last lines'of the letter which I considered unnecessary. We ■were, of course, alone at the time. The Sheikh took it very well and promptly disclaimed any intention of considering either myself or the Government neg lectful of his interests. He explained it away as an ordinary method of concluding important Arabic letters and I let it pass at that. v 11. As I trust that the view taken of the Fao incident here may he of some assistance to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, in his enquiry, I have forwarded a copy of this letter to him direct. . &gt; {Translation.)

I have the honour to forward herewith the latest news I have been able to obtain with regard to the Fao outrage. Enclosure of above. Report. During the Sheikh’s visit to the Political Agent on Friday morning, Novem ber 4th, he gave the following account of the progress of affairs in connection with Fao and the murder of Hamid bin Aleywah. 2. Abdul Mahsin, the Sbeikh’s newly-appointed Agent at Fao, is a Koweit subject and about 40 years old. 3. He went and interviewed the Wali of Basrah and complained of the condition of the lands at Fao and asked why four of the Sheikh’s fellahs had been arrested and why another with his wife and child had been shot down by the Turkish soldiers. 1114. The Wali asked in reply “why do you go to.the English ?” The Agent replied &lt;f because we are forced to do so. 5 . The Wali then asked w r hy Moolah Muhammad took the soldiers to the English, and tried to get Abdul Mahsin to admit that Moolah Muhammad wanted the men imprisoned. 6 . Abdul Mahsin, however, told the Wali the true story about the Kaim- makam and the four fellahs of Mubarak arrested the morning ^before the murder, how the Kaimmakam, in answer to Moolah Muhammad’s protesta tions and requests to know why they had been imprisoned, promised to release the prisoners before nightfall and instead sent them in custody to Basrah, and how in the morning a fresh outrage was committed in the murder of Hamid-bin-Aleywah and his wife and child. 7. “ Then,” went on Abdul Mahsin, “Moolah Muhammad, seeing that it was hopeless to expect redress from the Kaimmakam, took the Turkish soldiers and the corpses to secure the evidence of the British on board the man- of-war.” 8 . Eventually, the Wali released the four prisoners and cautioned Abdul Mahsin to come to him about Mubarak’s wishes which he would gladly exe cute and not go to the English. 9. Sheikh Mubarak agreed that this was satisfactory as far as it went, provided only that the Wali acted up to his assurances and said that he would be glad enough to settle his Fao affairs peaceably with the Turks if they refrained from outrages. In the latter case, however, he would have to appeal to the English. Telegram No. 89-C., dated the 1st December 1904. From—Foreign with Viceroy, Viceroy’s Camp, To— Captain A. P.

Secretary of State telegraphs, Noyember 11th:— ’Begins. Koweit. The Turk ish Government have complained of Major Knox’s appointment being incon sistent with the status quo. Reply of His Majesty’s Government is that no permanent appointment has been made, but that though Major Knox’s depu tation is temporary, they reserve the right to send an officer to Koweit at their uncontrolled discretion to report and ensure the continuance of the modus vivendi arrived at. Mj' despatch asking you to consider date for Major Knox’s temporary withdrawal went on llth November. Having regard to difficulty with Turkey at Aden and general situation elsewhere, Lord Lansdowne is very anxious that the question of Koweit should not at present be forced into prominence. Please consider question of Major Knox’s temporary with drawal with the view to the earliest possible date being fixed. Bnds. Poliowing reply sent 18th November:— Begins. Your telegram November llth. Koweit. I view with greatest regret communication of His Majesty’s Government to Turks that appointment of Political Agent, Koweit, is not permanent. This, in view of circumstances which necessitated revival of pro posal in May 1903 and recent communications, is complete surprise to me. Withdrawal of Agent will involve complete alienation of Sheikh Mubarak who is already doubtful of value of our friendship and will with his friend Bin Saud probably yield to repeated overtures of Turks. This will mean not merely extension of Turkish dominion down Persian Gulf but exposure of Koweit to advances of Foreign nations. We have already reported rumoured proposal made to Sheikh to receive Russian and French agents. I would, therefore, strongly urge that withdrawal of Knox should at any rate he postponed until our position with Mubarak and at head of Gulf is strong enough to permit such step without disastrous results which must now ensue. I am firmly convinced that if now withdrawn our Agent will never return as we shall have to face next time opposition not only of Turkey but also of Germany to resump tion of present favourable position. Bnds.Secretary of State telegraphs November 21st:— Begins. It is not intended that present withdrawal should be otherwise than temporary, nor should it be carried out in haste or in manner to lead Sheikh to think that it takes place otherwise than in the exercise of our own discretion, or that it implies any change in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government : throughout correspond ence it has been recognised as undesirable to raise whole question of our position at Koweit, and His Majesty’s Government consider this inconvenient time. Please therefore consider question of date and .manner of KnoxS temporary withdrawal so as to give effect to the policy of His Majesty s Govern ment and communicate with me. Ends. Please telegraph your proposals as to manner and date of Knox’s removal.

I have no doubt that Monsieur Goguyer is responsible for the contents of the extract. My reasons for forming this opinion are:— (1) He possesses a knowledge of Koweit and Koweit affairs probably un equalled by any other non-official resident of Maskat. (2) The excessive anti-English bias which is noticeable in many of his former writings also appears in this article, and I know of no other person in Maskat who entertains such hatred of us. (3) The article clearly implies that arms are imported into Koweit by the English. Monsieur Goguyer knows well that the (appa rent) inconsistency of publicly forbidding and privately encourag ing the importation of arms by us would be thoroughly understood by the natives in the present circumstances, and the manner m which the ideas are expressed in this extract bears the stamp of his ingenious manipulation.(4) It is possible that the writer’s remarks concerning the conveyance of arms to Koweit by merchants in mail steamers are made in the hope of inducing action to be taken which will leave the Koweit field in possession of those who send their consignments in dhows, as Goguyer does, vide my letter No. 263, dated 24th May last. 3 . A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. ? co. h I find the following article in Al Abram, dated the 4th November 1904 : — The sublime Forte. —The Bombay correspondent of the Debate, says that it is difficult to obtain correct news of the occurrences in Nejd, ever since the Wahabis began openly to destroy the Turkish authority over those regions. The reports received about the fights taking place between Ibn-i-Bashid, an ally of the sublime Porte, and Ibn-i-Saud, the leader of the rebels, are quite conflicting. Some say that the Turkish Minister, in Irak, has aided Ibn-i- Rashid by lending him a portion of the regular Turkish troops, who attacked Ibn-i-Saud, gaining a decisive victory over the Wahabis; while others say that about twenty thousand Wahabis fell upon Ibn-i-Rashid, under the leader ship of Ibn-i-Saud, and inflicted a severe defeat on Ibn-i-Rashid at Azila, and that the Turkish troops lost about 100 men in killed and wounded. It is further reported that Ibn-i-Saud after the above victory marched against Hayal, the Capital of Ibn-i-Rashid, with the object of seizing it, and that thereafter he will occupy Taif and then extend his influence and authority over the whole of el Hasa in place of that of the Turkish Government. This is not a thing, to gain which Ibn-i-Saud may not have formed his firm resolve, as he is the most noble of the Wahabi Amirs by his descent; and now the tribesmen in those parts of Arabia are inclined to believe that the power of Turkish Government has become weak. But the fulfilment of these hopes is more difficult than they imagine it to be, because there is nothing to prevent the Sublime Porte from sending strong reinforcements of troops, as soon as the winter approaches, in order to suppress the rebels, who, though they are known for their bravery, cannot stand in front of a sufficient number of the regular Turkish troops. It is also stated that the Wahabis have obtained quick firing guns from the foreigners (the English) ; but as they are not trained to work these guns, they will not derive much benefit from them. For these reasons it is supposed that if the Turkish Government resolve to punish the rebels they can do so during the ensuing cold weather. There is nothing to cause the Sublime Porte doubts or fear, except the disagreement existing between the officials, Turks and Arabs, who hate one another; and all the unrest and disturbances from which the Arabian peninsula has been sufiering for some years past are to be attributed to this disagreement. 0 CENTRAL CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT. No. 189, DATED THE 29TH NOVEMBER (RECEIVED 0TH DECEMBER) 1904. Extract from the Times of India, dated Bombay, tic e 26th November, 1904. The development of events at Bussorah demands the very close attention The preparations at Bussorah. Foreign Departmeiit. The pre- paration of the Turkish authorities for an expedition against Ibn Saud grow apace, and transport is being accumulated as for protracted operations. No one is so foolish as to believe that in taking the unusual course of an active interest in the condition of Central Arabia the Turkish Government are animated by a beatific desire after peace and order. Such aspirations are totally foreign to Abdul Mamed’s conceptions of statecraft, which consist of nothing more than the desire to play off race against race, class against class and so concentrate all authority in his own terror-stricken person. If no other interests were at stake, Turkey would be only too pleased for Ibn Saud and Ibn Rashid of Nejd to fight out their interminable quarrel for theV mastery of Central Arabia undisturbed, happy in the thought that whilst so engaged they would have little opportunity of troubling the Turks themselves. But Ibn Eashid happens to be the bitter enemy of our friend Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit. Every attempt of Ibn ftashid against Koweit, and of the Turks to help him, has ended in humiliating failure, and whilst Ibn Eashid is stalemated by the open feud with Ibn Sand, Sheikh Mubarak goes in peace. But if Ibn Eashid, with the aid of Turkish troops and money, able is decisively to defeat his rival and make himself undisputed master of Central Arabia, a very different situation is created. With the prestige attaching to victory—a prestige which in a country like Arabia can scarcely be* exagge-' rated—and the passive, if not the active, support of Turkey, Ibn Eashid would be in a position to open a dangerous campaign against Mubarak. This is the development which ought to be anticipated and prepared for. Of course it is a cry from Turkish preparations to Turkish action, and even from action to success, against a man like Ibn Saud, who has shown himself so well able to protect his interests; but in Arabia anything may happen, and unless the Government are prepared to see Koweit passing under Turkish influence, they must be ready to intervene as vigorously as they did when Turkish troops were marched down from Bussorah. There is no need to ponder upon the true inwardness of this movement. The mere recital of the facts that Koweit is the only practicable terminus of the Baghdad railway, that Mubrrak being under British protection the line can on^ terminate there on our terms, and that the Kaiser has set his heart upon the railway and his influence is supreme at Constantinople, is quite sufficient to indicate the chain of events which has induced the assemblage at Bussorah of an expedition to operate against Ibn Saud. .Foreign Deparment. h D.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a report, dated the 20th November 1904, which I have received from the Political Agent, Koweit, containing the latest news on the situation in Nejd. Report by Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, dated the 20th November 1904. At the Sheikh s visit last Friday, November 18th, he gave the following news regarding the situation in Nejd About six days ago, the Wall of Basrah replied to a letter from Abdul Rahman-bin-Saood to the Wali’s Agent. That letter was^ telegraphed to Constantinople; its tone was submis sive and conciliatory; Bin Saood said that he was an old servant of the Sultan, that Ibn Bashid was the aggressor, and that Bin Saood was ready to obey all the Sultan’s orders. The Wali’s reply, inspired from Constantinople, was that Bin Saood’s offers of service had been accepted by the Sultan, that he was not to go to the foreigners, and that the Turks would treat with him for the establishment of an officer in El Kasim and that they wished Sheikh Mubarek to come in to the scheme.” Sheikh Mubarek said that all this was rumour and unconfirmed. The Turkish lira is cheap in the bazaar and has fallen from Bs. 14-2-0 to Bs. 13-15-6. The reason for this is said to be the number of looted Turkish liras brought in by Bedouins who plundered Ibn Bashid. The Bedouins who have come in with the Boreyda and Aneyza merchants whose arrival was reported in last week’s Diary are said to have a number of Turkish soldiers’ tents and clothes with them and are wearing the fez in mockery. General bazaar rumour has it that Bin Saood is coquetting with the Turks and would like to enter their service and undertake to be responsible for the peace and security of Nejd, but be knows that this cannot be done without Sheikh Mubarek’s help. No one in the bazaar dares to speculate on what the Sheikh’s attitude will be.^0* c ^ ate ^ ^ us ^ irej ^ e i0t h (received 19th) December 1904. From Captain A, P.

No. 58, dated the 25th November 1904. From J. H. Monahan, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul, Basrah, To-W. B. Townley, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Afiaires, Constantinople. With reference to my despatch No. 51 of the 7&lt;h ultimo and to telegrams Nos. 61 of the 5th and 66 of the 25th instant, I have the honour to report as follows:— Many letters were received here towards the end of October brought by a messenger from Urn Saood to the effect that Ibn Bashid came out from Shenana on the 17th Eejib (21st September) with the Turkish force and the three or four guns which were still serviceable and tried to bombard a castle about an hour from Shenana called Kasr Ibn Akil in wbicli was Ibn Saood’s friend, the Sheikh of Boreyda. Ibn Saood came out from A1 Euss and there was a fight when Ibn Eashid almost immediately fled, no one knows whither, perhaps to Hail, and the Turkish force also fled with him. Much booty, including camels, horses and provisions, was left, and one gun, which were taken by Ibn Saood. Only a few were killed. I hear from another source only 13 on Ibn Eashid’s side, namely, three soldiers and ten Arabs. Ibn Eashid and bis men and the Turkish soldiers were before the fight exhausted, and demoralised, and there was much disaffection. Prisoners do not appear to have been taken, the Arabs of Ibn Saood being too busy collecting booty. _ The messenger was detained here in custody for 24 hours by the Acting Vali, who questioned him and then let him go with a small present having heard that he had. been beaten here by some soldiers and by some friends of Ibn Eashid. I understand that exaggerated reports of the victory have reached Koweit. Nothing, however, to contradict the above version in the letters has been received here by either Ibn Eashid’s or Ibn Saood’s party, and I hear that the Field Marshal at Baghdad has received a confirmatory report from Ibn Eashid himsdf, so I gather that this version is in the main true. The great efforts of the Government, which have been going on for the past three weeks to collect money for the purchase of camels for Ibn Eashid, are evidence of its truth. All the leading Mussulmans of Basrah, even Ibn Saood’s friends, the rich Jews, and even some Christians, have been forced by the moral pressure of Acting Vali, Eakhri Pasha, though in a kind and gentle manner, to give sums from 5 to 30 liras each. About 4,000 liras have, I hear, been collected from Basrah town, and the collection is going on in other parts of the Vilayet. Probably about 7,000 liras will be collected from the whole vilayet. The new Vali, Mukhlis Pasha, who landed here from the Eussian steamer from Constantinople on the I9th instant, has hot been taking any direct active part in the collection, but the police were yesterday still collecting in the town. Bakhri Pasha starts to-morrow for Baghdad. He has left the best impression here of energy, honestly and successfully shown in maintaining order in the vilayet, and especially in Basrah town. During his twm months’ stay tlnre has been in the town a degree of security, perhaps never before known.■y No. 94)7, British Residency and Consulate General, dated Baghdad, 13th November (received 23rd December) 1904-.

It is said the route has not yet been decided. Extract from the diary of the Political Resident in Turkish Araliafor the week ending the 28th November 1904. ****** The Vice-Consul at Kerbala reports as follows about the recent expedition against Ibn Saoud : — “ A belief has long been entertained here by the public that the four regiments originally sent in support of Ibn Rashid have been entirely annihi lated and that Ibn Rashid has sustained a serious defeat. This belief has been lately confirmed by the report of two privates who escaped from their regi ment at Jabal and arrived here about ten days ago.” “ They sav that their force experienced great hardship and hunger while en route to and in Jabal, and that a few days after their arrival, the Amir (Ibn Rashid) ordered them to prepare for an attack on the enemy. ’ “ The Amir placed the Turkish troops and their officers in front and his own men behind, the combined forces then entered Ibn Saoud’s territory and without much difficulty or fighting captured four towns compelling Ibn Saou and bis followers to retreat.” “After that Ibn Rashid received a letter from one Ibn Bassam in Borreida (members of the Bassam family are found in Basra and Syria as large traders) telling him that he had contrived certain plans for the delivery ot the place into his hands and asking him to go there with his forces as soon as possible.” “ The Amir was deceived and started for Borreida where he was surprised and attacked by Ibn Saoud. The Amir and his men who were in the rear escaped with about 800 officers and men because they knew the roads, but the others remained fighting and were either killed or captured. “All reports combine in giving an exceedingly pathetic account of the Turks in Ibn Rashid’s hands at Jabal : they are said to be severely treated and scantily maintained.”60 “ Two officers, a Meer Alai and a Colonel, were killed by the Amir in Jabal because they refused to obey the Amir’s orders and make a second invasion after their defeat.” “ The officers here are much incensed against the Amir but dare not express their feelings. The Amir has reported the occurrence to Constantinople ||) and fresh troops have been ordered to support him. The new expedition will consist of four regiments of infantry, each about 300 strong : twelve to sixteen guns with men and officers forming one regiment and perhaps one regiment of mule riders. These six regiments will be raised from Baghdad, Amara Kerbala, Hillah, and Kerkuk, and Baizi Pasha, the late acting Vali of Baghdad, will be in command.” “ The Government has sanctioned T. £5,000 for the necessary expenses but the late Vali has demanded T. £30,000.” “ The Beserves which have been mobilised are for the purpose of replac ing the soldiers of Paizi Pasha and these troops are to met at Najef and then follow tbe route taken by pilgrims to Jabal and Mecca; the transport will be by means of camels which will be supplied by the Amir.” “ Besides these troops it is said that another force will be sent from Hedjaz, both to meet at Jabal.” “ It is said that Paizi Pasha is very unwilling to go and has tried to get off this unexpected call to duty, but has failed to do so; he then asked to be allowed to proceed to Damascus with his troops and from there taking six more regiments proceed to Jabal: this also has been refused.” &lt;6 Paizi Pasha is said to have appointed one Pahad, son of Abdul Mihsin, formerly official Sheikh of the Aniza tribe, to accompany him, but on the request of the Amir, who is on bad terms with Pahad, he was dismissed and another man has been appointed.” “ This Pahad is said to be a friend of Ibn Saoud, and he was appointed to the Chieftanship of the Aniza tribe in order to win him over : what exactly was the object is not known.” &lt; ( Turkish officials and many others are looking on these disturbances with the belief that the English are at the bottom of it all.” ******c t '77 # * Telegram P., dated Bushire, the 23rd (received 23rd) December 1904.

Please refer to your telegram of the 1st December 1904, regarding the attitude of the'Sheikh of Koweit. There may be some delay in receiving the report of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah in regard to the Eao incident, the true story of which is difficult to unravel. Meanwhile after consulting Captain Knox, I submit a brief summary of the views on the general situation. The Sheikh is confident of our bond fide intentions to protect Koweit itself and to maintain his independence and he is not uneasy on that score. Recently he has taken a keen and cordial interest in the site and designs of the Agency building. He is disappointed chiefly because at present our protection does not operate effectively in external matters. He is in any case unlikely to entertain seriously the overture of other Christian Powers as he would require induce ments which they could not give. He is more likely to make terms with Turkey if neglected by us but the Sheikh will keep himself straight, believing that the fear of the consequences will excite our active enmity. * This opinion presupposes the maintenance of existing conditions. Apart from the Eao incident the continued imprisonment of his former Agent and the failure of our endeavours in that respect chiefly rankles. As to harassing attentions of Belgian Customs Department it is evident from previous protracted discussions received from Sheikh Mubarak and Captain Knox that these cases caused con siderable irritation at time of occurrence, but Captain Knox does not think their effect is lasting or that they excited Mubarak against us. I shall send details of outstanding claims between Koweit subjects and the Customs Department.Extract from the diary of the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf for the week ending the 19tk November 1904, ***** Koweit. 5. 31st Ocifo&amp;er.—Mulla Muhammad, Sheikh Mubarek’s Agent concerned in the Fao incident, returned to Koweit.' ‘t/yuc/v.eShz. 7^.

Sheikh Mubarak wrote some time ago to Pakhri Pasha and received a reply which asked for news of the soldiers in Kejd. The Sheikh replied that Nejd was like an orphan without a mother, and that the people of Nejd had no objection to Turkish rule without Ibn liashid. He added that he wrote without any personal interest in the matter, but merely as a friend. Sheik Mubarak up to the 6th heard that the talk about troops was all silenced, and that no troops were now going, and that all the money collected at Bussorah and the environs T. 13,000 had been sent to Constantinople. Bin Saud has received a reply from the new Wall at Bussorah to say that his submission has been accepted and that Ibn Eashid will not be assisted by the Turks. A tribe called ’Umra has looted Ibn Eashid near Hail and killed 35 persons, taken 15 horses and a quantity of camels. Some of Ibn Easliid’s best men have been killed. Ibn Eashid is said to have 1,200 soldiers still with him. A representative has been sent by Ibn Eashid to A1 Hassa to replace the late Saad-el-Hazemi, He arrived about a month ago. Jasim-uth-Thani, Sheikh of Katr, has written three letters to the Turkish authorities, one for Constantinople, one for Baghdad and one for Bussorah. He praises the good work and faithful services of the Subah and Saud families and says that up to date the Chiefs have been ready to do their best for the Turkish Government and to obey. These letters were shown by Sheikh Mubarak to my informant, who thinks that they must have been written by a Turkish official, as the style and language (Arabic) is far superior to the letters written by the ordinary inhabit ants of the country. They were brought by the son of Sheikh Jasim-uth-Thani to Sheikh Mubarak, who sent them on on the 4th December by his own .messengers. He pretends to his own people and the Turks that he does not know the contents of those letters. Jasim Thani also wrote, as before, that, if Ibn Eashid is assisted by the Turks, all Arabia will rise in defence of Bin Saud. S. G. KNOX, Captain, Political Agent, Koweit. G. I. C. P. O.- No. 3260 F.

In continuation of my telegram, “ Bahrein Affairs, No 1 ” dated 19th instant, ! have the honour to submit a full report regarding the recent ease of assault by Bahrein subjects upon a German trader at that port—Mr Bahnson— the local representative of Herr Wonckhaus, a gentleman with whose name the Government of India are, I think, familiar. 2. Before the ensuing paragraphs are considered, I solicit perusal of the preliminary correspondence in the case, contained in enclosures 1 to 14 It will be noticed that the two recent Bahrein incidents involving (1) an assault on a German trader, and (2) an alleged attack on Persian subjects by Arabs and Negroes of Bahrein, are so far connected in that Sheikh Ali or his rowdy followers are more or less implicated in both; but as the former case has been provisionally settled by me ad referendum, it seems preferable to keep the record of it separate as far as practicable from that of the second incident which may have to be dealt with independently. 3. What transpired up to the date of my return from tour and arrival at Bahrein may be summarised as follows:— On 29th September occurred the assault upon Mr. Bahnson and certain of his employes, by the followers of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, nephew of the Sheikh of Bahrein. Slieikh Ali himself was also partially concerned. On that date Mr. Gaskin was still our representative at Bahrein. He inquired into the matter on the spot, made certain recommendations or demands upon the Sheikh for the suitable punishment of the offenders and reported the ascertained facts of the case and his own action thereon to the Besidency on 1st October. The Sheikh of Bahrein took no immediate action whatever in the direction of the punishment or detention of any of those concerned, but contented himself with despatching to the Besidency by the same mail a communication in which he took up the cudgels in his nephew’s behalf and preferred a counter-complaint against the German (enclosures 3 and 4). 4. In the meanwhile Captain E. B. Prideaux was on his way from India to relieve Mr. Gasldn at Bahrein and was met en route by a communication from my Assistant, Captain Trevor, instructing him to take up the matter on arrival and endeavour to effect a settlement (enclosure 5). It was unfortunate that a case of this nature should have occurred just as one officer was leaving and another taking over charge. Captain Prideaux was naturally obliged to depend on second hand information and, at first, arrived at conclusions (on information and premises which he afterwards realised to be biassed) considerably at variance with those formed by his predecessor. I merely mention this fact in order to dismiss it, for it will be noticed that on a closer acquaintance with Bahrein affairs, Captain Prideaux altogether altered his views and then even went a step further in his conclusions and recommendations as to punishment, than did Mr. Gaskin (enclosure 12). 5. The result, however, of his first impression was that he entered into communication with Herr Wonckhaus (enclosures 8 and 9) and that the latter not considering the terms of settlement offered by Captain Prideaux to be adequate informed that officer on 30th October that he had referred the corre spondence to the Consular representative of the German Government at Bushire, and would leave himself in that official’s hands. This was a course bearing considerable political significance. The Imperial German Consul at Bushire made no reference on the subject to my locum tenons^ but addressed the Sheikh of Bahrein direct, and the latter, under Captain Prideaux’ guidance, gave him a very suitable reply (enclosure 11). What, if any, further action my German colleague took on receiving the Sheikh’s answer I have not ascertained. Meanwhile on 5th November another complaint was preferred by Herr Wonckhaus against an employe of the Chief s 3263 F. D. *son and recognised heir, Sheikh Earned bin Esa ; the basis of it being a similar attempt to impress coolie labour, as that which had given rise to the assault on Mr. Bahnson a month before (enclosure 10). 6 . Sheikh Isa and Captain Prideaux being unable to arrive' at any uni formity of views in the matter, it was agreed between them that it should await settlement pending my arrival which was expected at no distant date (enclosure 3 and elsewhere). 7. Meanwhile on 14th November occurred the second incident; that of an affray between a number of Arab and Negro subjects of the Sheikh and a sec tion of the small community of His Majesty the Shah’s subjects residing in, Bahrein for purposes of trade, in the course of which two Persians very nearly lost their lives and seven others were more or less damaged. The Sheikh,, as will be seen from the correspondence, having failed to take any particular steps in the matter the Persians sent across to Bushire a tele gram addressed to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, a translation of whose reply forms enclosure No. 13 ; and as rowdyism was still rife in the Manama Bazaar, and the Persians refused to open their shops, Captain Trevor was able to arrange for the despatch of H.M.S. Redbreast to Bahrein on 27th November as°a precautionary measure. Matters were at this stage when I arrived at Bushire from the Karun on 29th November and having been posted in the details by my Assistant, I left without disembarking for Bahrein. Prom this point I think what follows can he preferably related in diary form. 8 . November Arrived Bahrein at noon. Captain Prideaux and the Sheikh came off to the Lawrence to interview me. They arrived separately and I saw Captain Prideaux first for a few moments. I learnt from him that just before the arrival of Redbreast a few days previously, Sheikhs Ali bin Ahmed, and Earned bin Esa, with their followers, had proceeded together to the mainland, ostensibly for purposes of shikar, and were still absent. Except for this fact there was no change in the position as last reported, and the Persian shops remain closed. I then received the Sheikh’s visit. After exchanging with him the usual greetings and after some conversation on general topics, I explained to him that having heard of the two recent incidents at Bahrein, on reaching civilization I had come straight over without landing at Bushire with a view to settling them without delay and was consequently somewhat exercised to learn from Captain Prideaux that Sheikh Ali and his followers, apparently the principal persons concerned, had been permitted to absent themselves from Bahrein indefinitely; especially as it was known that I should arrive in a few days. In reply Sheikh Esa assured me that the party had only gone for purposes of sport and were expected backat any moment; at all events he would at onoe send a messenger after them and get them back forthwith. I inquired whether it was usual for members of his family to undertake extensive hunting trips during the exhausting fast of the month of Bamzan and added' tliat I begged he would take effective steps to insure their early return in ordOtr that I might be enabled to settle the two outstanding cases expeditiously. Sheikh Esa promised to comply but went on to observe that Sheikh Ali and his followers were only implicated in the first case, and that pending their return couldrnot the second case be proceeded with ? He went on to say that Sheikh Ali had had nothing to do with the later incident, and that Captain Prideaux had only heard the Persian version, and suggested that if I would kindly inquire into the case myself I should find that it was all the fault of the Persians. This assertion as to Sheikh Ali’s non-connection with the second incident was inconsistent with the Political Agent’s report, but I simply replied to the Chief that it seemed to me clearly desirable to dispose of the first case, before dealing with or even discussing the second. \_Note.- My reason for being of this opinion was that the circumstances in the first (brerman) incident were not open to any doubt, and I therefore thought that the bond fide or otherwise of the Sheikh's co-operation in that case would guide me as to how to deal with mm m the second case.]a We then parted, I proceeding ashore to the British Agency at Manama and the Sheikh to Muharrag to despatch at messenger after the absentees. 9. December 1st .—Sheikh Ali did not return. Sheikh Esa sent to inquire whether he should call at the Agenoy. I replied that as Sheikh Ali had not arrived I would not trouble him to-day, but reiterated the necessity of expe- ditin 0, his nephew’s return and begged that he would come over on the morrow forenoon in any case, whether his nephew had returned or not. 10. December 2nd. —Sheikh Ali still absent. Sheikh Esa came over from Muharrag about 10 a.m., and we had another lengthy interview at which Captain Prideaux was present. I thought it was now time to speak to the Chief plainly and to apprise him of my views, as time was slipping by. I told him that I had in the first instance frankly accepted his assurance that his nephew and followers were only out for a shooting excursion and that he could get them back at once, but that this was the third day of my presence in Bahrein and that he could hardly wonder if I began to suspect that their absence was preconcerted. I then went ofi to say that my view as to what measures it was incumbent upon him to take in regard to the German case coincided with those of Mr.. Gaskin and Captain Prideaux, namely, that the ringleaders should be flogged; Es 1,000 paid in compensation; and that Sheikh Ali be compelled to leave Bahrein, subject to approval of Government. Sheikh Esa then entered into a lono- demur in which he took up the cudgels for Sheikh Ali and argued that he had” clone nothing to deserve such punishment, as that involved by measures su o °ested, to all of which he demurred. Tins brought the specific question of Sh°eikh All’s position in Bahrein into the discussion. I reminded Sheikh Esa that I had been some five years in the Gulf and that from what Sheikh Ali had himself told me at Maskat I had for long been aware of his character and his not unnaturally disaffected attitude. I reminded Sheikh Esa that only six months ago he had, I thought, confided in Mr. Gaskin regarding his nephew’s troublesome personality and had prompted our representative to address to me a proposal * ior the making of a public * Vide this office letter No. 136 of I9tii May pronouncement in Bahrein in such plain fS «htuSo4 t ’ totWnt 2D67 - E ' fcl terms that Sheikh Ali would accept it as applying to his own case, without the necessitv of any specific mention of his name. I added that the idea had had my cordial approval, and that it had only awaited the advent of a more senior Political Officer at Bahrein before being taken into serious consideration. I explained to him that his present surprising attitude in championing Sheikh Ali could only convey the impression that so long as Sheikh All s doings affected his own convenience and peace of mind injuriously, nothing was bad enough for his nephew. He was said by his uncle to be disloyal, turbulent and most felonious in his tendencies. On the other hand, now that he was involved in an obvious offence against Europeans or^Others under me protective purview of the British Agency, Sheikh Esa and his son and heir were found to take his part and give him all possible support.^ now aid e, Sheikh Esa, think the Government of India would interpret such an attitude on his part after all they had done for him ? In reply the Chief admitted his previous inward misgivings regarding Sheikh Ali, but explained that he did not fear his machinations or secret enmity now in his own lifetime but rather later on after his demise. He then repeated the arguments he had employed before in palliation of what had passed, and urged that the whole incident or incidents would be adequately met and Sheikh Ali effectively subdued by my giving him a severe talking to in the presence of his uncle and Captain Prideaux. I was unable to concur in this view, and after considerable reiteration and further discussion the Sheikh finally agreed that as soon as returned”'-—* (1) The compensation money of Es. 1,000 should he levied and lo e e at the Agency. , (2) ) The four or five ringleaders having been produced or identmea should be whipped and expelled from Manama.4 That after the above two conditions had been actually fulfilled I should see Sheikh Ali in the presence of the Chief and Captain Prideanx and should warn him regarding his departure from Bahrein pending receipt of the views of Government, I sug gested his either going on pilgrimage to Mecca or on a visit to Maskat, Lingah or Koweit. Sheikh Esa also agreed, if I so desired, to publish a notification prohibiting the custom of “Sukhra*” or “employment of forced coolie labour ” by the petty Sheikhs of Bahrein. At the same time he pointed out that he had already warned those con cerned on the subject, and that we were welcome to regard it as an accepted fact that he did not recognize the practice in any way. 11. Before separating we agreed that it was of no use our meeting again until Sheikh Ali had arrived and until the above conditions (1) and (2) had been actually put into effect. [A T o^.—It was necessary to decide hours of meeting a long while in advance as incle ment weather made communication between Manama and Muharrag and between the Agency and the ships exceedingly difficult and tedious all the time I was there and impeded our work very much.] 12 . December 3rd.—Sheikh Ali did not return during the day, but we heard after dark that he had just returned and was spending the night with the Chief at Muharrag. December Mb .—About 8 a.m, a bag of Rs. 1,000 was received at the Agency by the band of one of the Sheikh’s men. At 10 a.m. Sheikh Esa, accompanied by Sheikh Ali and his son, Sheikh Earned, arrived from Muharrag. In spite of our agreement of 2nd instant that we would not meet until conditions (1) and (2) had been fulfilled, they all obtained ingress to the Agency Reception Room and sent word to me that they had come and wanted to see me. I sent Captain Prideanx in to give Sheikh Esa my compliments and to say that the compensation money, Rs. 1,000, had arrived safely and I was much obliged for it, but that according to our previous agreement, the ringleaders had to be produced or all Sheikh Alps servants paraded for identi fication before I could have any further meeting with themselves. Captain Prideaux brought back the reply that it was this question of the production of the ringleaders that they wished to discuss with me; they were willing it appeared to pay another Rs. 1,000 if Sheikh Ali’s servants could he spared the corporal punishment. As this Rs. 1,000 would merely have come out of Sheikh Esa’s pocket of course I remained obdurate, and was eventually informed that Sheikh Ali had gone to the town to collect his men. A little later 4 culprits were produced and duly identified by Mr. Bahnson as having actually participated in the assault &lt;m him. I may mention here that, apart from bruises, the latter received a very nasty wound on the head and narrowly escaped having his skull fractured. The four men having been brought and identified Sheikh Esa asked permis sion to return to Muharrag as it was now getting late and left his son, Abdulla, with instructions to have the chastisement of the men carried out in communi cation with me. Before he took his departure it was agreed between us that I would start the inquiry into the Arab-Persian affray case the following morning and that he would send his son or 'Vazier to represent him with instructions to present before me any of his subjects whom I might wish to examine. After his departure the matter of chastisement was proceeded with and every possible obstruction was offered. The Sheikh’s Bazaar Master in Manama who was the proper person to perform the operation, was sent for and directed to bring his canes and executioner. He absolutely refused saying that no canes could be procured and that it was more than he dared, to have any hand in the punishment of Sheikh Ali’s men directly or indirectly. Finally, I was obliged to send to the Commander of His Majesty’s Ship Redbreast for a weapon, and two Arab bystanders or retainers of his own were called upon by Sheik Abdulla to inflict the whipping.9 5 They were both tried and both endeavoured to make a farce of it, and after one or two futile experiments the services of a blue-jacket were called in as a last resort, and two dozen strokes suitably administered in the presence of the doctor. The flogging was performed in the public street outside the British Agency. 13. I have now completed the narrative of the progress and details of the case and feel that an apology is necessary for the tedious length which the relation of them has achieved. Had Bahrein difficulties ended with the present case I should not have thought it necessary to report in such detail. But in order to deal with the second case which I have to report upon in continuation of my telegram, “Bahrein Affairs No. 2,” dated 12th instant, the Government of India will, I think, find it necessary to take the Whole situation now existing at Bahrein into serious review. It is consequently most important that they should be in a position to form conclusions on the detailed facts reported apart from any personal views which Captain Prideaux or I may he found to put forward. 14. As regards the chastisement of Sheikh Ali’s truculent retainers. Captain Prideaux and I had plenty of opportunities during the remaining five days of my stay in Bahrein of gauging its effect. I can only say that both missionaries, merchants and others with whom we came in contact were of opinion that in the eyes of all law abiding members of the Manama community, Arab or otherwise, the punishment exacted had been badly needed and had had a highly salutary effect. 15. As regards the incident generally I have the honour to point out that when the temporary situation at Bahrein came to my knowledge on 29th November I had to regard it from three points of view— (1) That a young European trader of quiet and inoffensive character had been severely assaulted and that in order to reassure European subjects of our own and those of other Powers for the safety of whose subjects in Bahrein we are morally responsible, prompt and vigorous action was evidently necessary. ( 2 ) That Herr Wonckhaus’s reference to the German Consulate at Bushirehad brought into prominent issue the nature of our quasi- protectorate in Bahrein in the same way that Erench action has recently done in another connection, and that the German Government or any other Government similarly interested would gain an opening for assailing our regime, if they could show that we could not or did not give their subjects effective protection. I may add confidentially that I find that my active Bussian colleague * thought the Bahrein incidents of sufficient public interest to send°a long wire to his Government on the subject. (3) It was evident from the reports of our local officers that owing to the weakness of Sheikh Esa’s rule a considerable amount of rowdyism was generally prevalent in Manama which it was necessary to repress. 16. I shall say more on the subject of Sheikh Ali’s future when reporting on the second incident. Meanwhile I heg that as soon as possible after perusal of the foregoing the Government of India will be pleased to instruct me by telegraph to the following effect so far as is in accordance with their own views:— (1) That the compensation money of Bs. 1,000 may be paid over to Mr, Bahnson. (2) That I may be permitted to warn Sheikh Esa as from Government that Sheikh Ali will not be permitted to return to Bahrein at the expiry of the provisional three weeks’absence stipulated for by me, should it so happen that Government have not been able within that time to come to a decision with regard to inm. The undertaking obtained from Sheikh Esa in this connection forms enclosure No. Id to this report.6 From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Majok P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward, for your information, copy of a letter, dated the 29th September 1904, I have received from Herr 'Wonckhaus, regarding an outrage committed by Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and his followers in the German firm’s premises on Thursday last. I would venture to report that immediately on the receipt of information I proceeded to the scene of the outrage and interrogated the members of the German firm’s staff concerned in the matter and found the main facts to be as set forth in the above-quoted communication. I caused Sheikh Ali to appear before me to explain his conduct. He stated that by bis orders his servant went out to secure a coolie for his service and when he got hold of one, the German’s native clerk assaulted his servant with a stick and inflicted several contusions on the man’s body and bad drawn blood, also be produced a broken cane alleged to have been employed by the clerk. The man was produced and upon examination no traces of assault were visible aud the stick was admitted to belong to Sheikh Ali’s man, but evidently a scuffle bad taken place and the clerk had wrenched the stick from Sheikh All’s man and made use of it. The man, however, appears to have been the aggressor by seizing hold of the clerk by the throat and the latter defended himself in the best way he could. Sheikh Ali’s man apparently took an exaggerated story to his master whereupon the latter sent after the native clerk to appear before him, but being occupied with the firm’s business be informed the Sheikh’s messenger that he would go to him later on. Sheikh Ali evidently took umbrage at the reply and proceeded with a number of followers to the German’s bouse and meeting the clerk in the hall asked him if he had struck his servant, and on receiving a reply in the affirmative he struck the clerk some blows on the left side of the neck. The Sheikh’s followers at the same time seized another coolie on the premises and started hiding him with sticks and Mr. Bahnson, an Assistant to Herr Wonckhans, hearing the noise went below and in the attempt to extricate the coolie, received several blows about his person and head, one of which inflicted a cut a little over inches long exposing the scalp and causing the loss of a quantity of blood. When questioned Sheikh Ali at first denied having struck the clerk, but when confronted with him he acknowledged having done so. Further, he made no attempt to stop his followers from assaulting the coolie on the premises when asked to do so by Mr. Bahnson, and when the latter endeavoured to pro tect the coolie, Sheikh Ali tried to stop him from reaching the coolie. Under ordinary circumstances the incident would not have been considered so serious. But the conditions prevailing in Bahrein are such as to necessitate the adoption of extreme measures for the suppression of similar occurrences which otherwise may jeopardize the lives of Europeans and their employes should they be repeated. I have been obliged to bring to the notice of the Chief the interference of his men and the attendants of the petty Sheikhs with persons in the service of the British and German firms here on several occasions, and though the Chief has warned the petty Sheikhs accordingly, they do not appear to pay any heed . to him. Unless the servants are effectually protected from molestation the firms I have considered it my duty to put the case before the Chief strongly and demanded the punishment and expulsion of the men who were concerned in the outrage also a fine of Rs. 1,000. The Chief fsaid he would enquire into the matter and communicate with me later. I trust that you will approve of my action. • -■ - will find their employes deserting them to the detriment of their business generally.The Chief will probably endeavour to avoid doing anything in the matter as he is a little afraid of Sheikh Ali and his brothers, and it may be necessary for you to bring strong pressure to bear upon the Chief to induce him to punish ||the offenders. Enclosure No. 2. Dated the 29th September 1904, p rom —H erb Robebt Wonckhaus, Bahrein, To J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. I am sorry to have to report to you the following matter. This forenoon some of my regularly employed coolies were engaged in measuring shells and in bringing them into my godown ; while thus employed one of the coolies was taken hold of by one of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s men, as Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed wanted some coolies to work for him (sukhra). The coolie refused and ran into my godown leaving one empty bag of mine in the hands of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s men who stuck to it. My native clerk, Abdulla bin Ostat Ahmed, noticing this went to Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s man asking him why he did so, and adding, out of politeness to Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, that if Sheikh Ali was in need of some coolies he might only send to his Saheb, and he would be sure of getting some but that those coolies in question were employed just now in urgent work for me, but other coolies were at his disposal if he cared to make it known to me. The Sheikh’s man replied he wanted these very coolies and none else, saying this in a very inso lent way. Thereupon my native clerk, Abdulla, requested the man to return the empty bag belonging to me, which he had taken forcibly from the coolie. This man refused again, becoming insolent. Abdulla then took hold of the bag adding at the same time that if Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed was in need of some empty bags too, he might send to me and ask for some. The man of the Sheikh did not listen to reason, and each of the two parties tried to tear the hag from the other. So far this had happened just in front of my house, but duriDg this dispute about the bag, both of them entered my godown. In my godown the Sheikh’s man got hold of my clerk by the throat whereupon my clerk in his turn got hold of the other man’s throat and struck him once or twice with the stick belonging to the Sheikh’s man. This stick he had managed to take away from the man during the fight. Mr. Bahnson, a European employee of mine, who was sitting in the office upstairs] heard the noise and ran down, succeeding, together with another man belonging to Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, to separate the two people. Mr. Bahnson thereupon returned to the office upstairs. Eive or ten minutes after this Mr. Bahnson was informed by one of my boys, that Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed had come into my house himself, where upon Mr. Balmson invited him through the clerk, Abdulla, to come upstairs, which the Sheikh refused. The Sheikh then asked Abdulla who is person ally well known to him, whether he had struck him the Sheik s man 5 and receiving a reply m the affirmative he struck Abdulla several blows with bis stick. Abdulla crossing bis arms and offering no resistance whatsoever out of respect for Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, which according to my personal idea this man never deserved. I must add here that Sheikh Ali did not come all by himself hut was accompanied by about twenty of his servants and followers who all of them were armed with sticks. Some of Sheikh Ali’s people took one of my coolies who was absolutely unconcerned in the matter and gave him a strong hiding in front of All bin Ahmed. This all happened in my own house just below the office. When Mr. Bahnson heard a noise again he went downstairs and seeing that the Sheikh’s men were hammering away at one of my coolies in my own house, ordered them to stop, and when this had no effect, covered the coolie with his own body, naturally assuming that this would effectively stop ^ their outrageous conduct. Mr. Bahnson had run down as he had been sitting m the office without a hat on and naturally neither carried stick nor any other arms, which in itself should have proved to the people that he had absolutely no aggressive intention. Instead of stopping the beating of the unfortunate coo ie,the well-meant action of Mr. Bahnson produced quite an unforeseen effect. The lot of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s people, about twenty of them, at once started to hammer away with their sticks at Mr. Bahnson, inflicting among, other injuries, a nasty cut on Mr. Bahnson’s head long and about J' broad which produced a very strong loss of blood, in fact Mr. Bahnson being covered*! with his own blood all over the head, face and chest, the shirt being soaked with blood. During this assault on Mr. Bahnson Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed pretended to protect Mr. Bahnson by getting hold of his body and one of his arms, which naturally, instead of proving a protection only hindered Mr. Bahnson in the use of his arms, which he was holding up for protection of his head. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed did not order his men to stop, and in Mr. Bahnson’s opinion his behaviour proved that his people were acting under his* own orders, and that he, Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, never really meant to protect Mr. Bahnson. Mr. Wonckhaus who had been out of the house visiting a customer received news that fighting was going on in his house and hurrying back to the house found that the people had just left off striking Mr. Bahnson. On his arrival most of the assailants dispersed. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed himself with five or six of his followers remaining in the house. Mr. Wonckhaus having no idea what really had happened but seeing Mr. Bahnson bleeding profusely asked Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed to come upstairs and explain matters, telling him that I would send to the British Assistant Political Agent, Mr. Gaskin, and that it would be well for him, Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, to have the matter settled through Mr. Gaskin privately. To this Sheikh Ali first agreed, but when being upstairs for two or three minutes, he decided otherwise and said he would go to his own house, and if anything of him was being wanted, Mr. Gaskin might send for him, this in a very insolent tone. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed then left with his followers and Mr. Wonckhaus cleaned Mr. Bahnson’s wound and face of the blood and bandaged the wound. Ten minutes after this Mr. Gaskin arrived in my house and the rest of course is known to you. I have had repeatedly to complain to Mr. Gaskin against the highhanded ness of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s and other Sheikh’s servants and followers, and the customs of the Sheikh’s men pressing my coolie they happen to meet for work, which the Sheikh wants to be done is a highly deplorable habit, which I venture to think ought to be stopped by the responsible authorities once for all. I do not think it necessary to point out to you the seriousness of the offence committed by Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and his followers, and I only venture to inform you of Mr. Bahnson’s idea of compensation and satisfaction. The least which Mr. Bahnson expects is :— Firstly—The public punishment of the more conspicuous assailants who are known to Mr. Bahnson and my clerk, Abdulla, who was present. These men will be recognised when the culprits will be brought before Mr. Bahnson, In order to be sure that the punishment is really meted out to the culprits, Mr. Bahnson suggests that he should be present at the occasion. Secondly —Mr. Bahnson expects a money compensation of Es. 1,000 (one thousand rupees) for the injury received; and Thirdly —I should think it fit if intimation were to be given to all the petty Sheikhs of the island, that they have to abstain from pressing coolies who are employed by me for their work. I hope that you will be able to bring the matter to a satisfactory con clusion. Enclosure No. 3. Translation of a letter from Sheikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 20th Rajab 1322 (1st October 1904). I beg to forward, herewith, for your information a petition which has been addressed to me by Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed al Khalifah on the subject of theoccurrence which took place between him and Bahnson, the German, and to state that I am not anxious that sueh occurrences should happen, but after it occurred I made investigation to ascertain the truth. It appeared that the fault was on the part of the German. He has also done further oppression, and I have received many complaints against him ®which I have not taken into consideration. When Ali bin Ahmed submitted his petition and produced proofs that he was not guilty, and that the guilt was on the part of the German, I deemed it necessary to represent the case to you because, if such proceedings are repeated by him and others, disturbances will take place. The decision rests with you. Enclosure No. 4. From—S heikh Ali bin Ahmed al Khalifah, Bahrein, To—S heikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein. I beg to bring to your notice that a jolly boat containing some cargo for me arrived here to-day, and I told my servants to land it. They hired coolies on the wharf. One of the coolies entered the building in which the German resides and one of our men followed him to call him, whereupon the servants of the German turned him out and assaulted him. This news reached me hut I did not believe that he will consent that our men should be beaten. I despatched some servants to enquire into the case. Ere their arrival on the spot the German’s servants came out and began to beat them; I could not keep quiet at that time, and I went to reconcile the parties with a view that no disturbance may occur and that I may not be blamed by the Sheikhs for having acted impolitely. When I reached the gate of the building, I saw a large number of people consisting of the German’s servants, coolies and the people who work on the wharf. Meanwhile the junior German whose name is Bahnson saw me, came down, and caught me by waist and did not allow me to reconcile the parties. Indeed, if I did not fear the Sheikhs I would not have allowed him to dis honour me thus. When I and him were pushing each other, his head was scratched by the wall and there are many witnesses to this fact. If you wish I will produce the witnesses. I thought it necessary to represent the case to you and you^ will not be pleased that such disregard should be shown to me by a man who is well known to be an oppressor and wicked. Enclosure No. 5. Telegram, dated the 7th October 1904. From— Captain A, P. Tkevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Captain F.

You might, after consulting Gaskin, enquire into the matter, and if no settlement can be effected locally, submit a report giving your views and recommendations at an early date, and saying if you concur with Gaskin as to punishment, etc. NOTE. This message could not be sent yesterday owing to press of work. To-day Mr. MuDgavin wired, suggesting I should write demi-officially to Captain Prideaux to catch him at Maskat. 3263 F. DI have written practically in the same terms as the message rather amplified to Captain Prideaux, and have asked him in addition whether he considers that if the case cannot be settled by him and the Chief it should wait till Resident’s visit. A. P. TREVOR. The 8th October 1904. No. 342, dated the 11th October 1904, From— Captain A. P. Tkevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To — Sheikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein. I have received your letter dated 20th Rajab 1322 (1st October 1904), regarding the unfortunate incident which has happened between your nephew 5 Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and Herr Bahnson, the German. I have also received the version of the incident from the opposite party, and it seems to me that it is very important, in the interests of ali concerned, that you should use your best endeavours to settle the matter at an early date in consultation with the Political Officer. Enclosure No. 7. No. 252, dated the 31st October 1904. From— Captain F. B. Prideatjx, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to my predecessor’s letter No. 225, dated the 1st October 1904, with which Mr. Gaskin forwarded a copy of a letter received from Mr. Wonckhaus on the subject of a fracas that had occurred in the latter’s courtyard, and in which he reported the demands he had made to the Chief of Bahrein for satisfaction, and asked for your approval concerning them. 2. On looking into the case myself, I cannot help thinking that the terms imposed by Mr. Gaskin are unreasonably severe, and this opinion 1 find is held both by Messrs. Milborrow and Zwemer, the other Europeans on the Island, and also by all the leading natives of the place. Before, therefore, mooting the subject at all to the Chief, I have endeav oured to persuade Mr. Wonckhaus to lessen his demands, but unfortunately without success. 3. Copies of the letter I addressed to Mr. Wonckhaus and of the reply I received are enclosed. Mr. Wonckhaus’ letter has not effected any change in my opinion. The {C Sukhra ” custom being such as it is, I do not think Sheikh All’s clerk was bound to accept the cooly’s word that he was in the employment of Mr. Wonckhaus until it was corroborated by Abdulla. I can find no evidence that Sheikh Ali instigated the assault on Mr. Bahnson, and if it be conceded that the Sheikh’s followers did not strike that gentleman accidentally, their action can still be suitably dealt with by imprisonment. Mr. Bahnson is anxious to see the men “ sticked ” but in a country so much affected by British influence, as Bahrein, I think the punishment of flogging should be countenanced as rarely as possible by ourselves. Lastly, there is no doubt, I believe, that in this case Sheikh Isa’s sympa thies are strongly with Sheikh Ali, and that if the payment of a fine is insisted upon, it will be paid solely by the Chief himself. As the latter’s impecunious state is well known, I am inclined to deprecate imposing upon him this form of punishment whenever any alternative can be devised to meet the case. 4. I shall at the first opportunity inform Sheikh Isa that the whole question has been referred to you for consideration, and I venture to express the opinion that if you consider the terms I have suggested too light, they can be most suitably made heavier by the enhancement of the periods of imprisonment to be imposed on the Sheikh’s followers or by the latter’s expul sion from the Islands.11 Enclosure No 8. No. 248, dated the 28th October ] 904. From— 'Captain 1. B. Pkideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Herk Robert Wonckhaus, Bahrein. ||[ I have been considering the case reported by you to my predecessor in regard to which you claim compensation from Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed al Khalifah for the assault committed by his servants on your Assistant, Mr. Bahnson. Having heard both sides and made further independent enquiries, I think that the following are the points of importance to be noted, there having been errors of judgment and improper actions on both sides, those on the Sheikh’s undoubtedly preponderating. The first mistake of course was committed when Sheikh AH’s man refused to give up your firm’s bag to your man, Abdullah. The latter, however, then erred still more seriously when he endeavoured to recover the bag by force, used language which was calculated to accentuate the quarrel, and ended by striking the Sheikh’s servant with the latter’s own stick. At this point it will be noticed that Mr. Bahnson was assisted by another servant of the Sheikh’s to terminate the fight, and if matters had locally been carried no further, I think your servant would have been adjudicated to be the greater offender. I have been told that he has an overbearing manner which in a case like the one under consideration was not advantageous to your interests. Sheikh Ali, however, immediately lost all his advantage by sending peremptorily round for Abdullah, then entering your premises without consenting to see Mr. Bahnson, striking Abdullah and permitting his followers to thrash one of your coolies who had no concern with the case, but who was presumably believed to be the original starter of it. At this stage Mr. Bahnson committed an error of judgment by going down into the melee instead of sending round word either to Sheikh Isa’s chief representative on the Island or to Mr. Gaskin, the British Political Officer. I do not believe that Sheikh Ali himself had any intention of causing Mr. Bahnson to be beaten, and it is difficult to say whether the servants struck him accidentally or through exasperation at his intervention. At any rate it does not appear that the cooly was very much hurt, and the injury done to Mr. Bahnson’s sense of dignity was probably greater than that committed on his per son. The fracas seems to have subsided of itself before your arrival on the scene, and the fact that Sheikh Ali accompanied'you upstairs indicates, I think, that he was anxious to settle the affair amicably. I presume that he left you before Mr. Gaskin’s arrival on getting some idea of the terms which you contemplated demanding of him and because he thought them unreasonable. The system of SuJchrct is, as you know, one of long standing—a right enjoyed by all the members of the Buling Pamily of Bahrein and other Arab States, over the peasant class, and is not to be abolished without the exercise of a good deal of diplomacy or without time. Sheikh All’s servant has been punished for not realizing that the cooly who started the trouble was your employee by the beating he received from Abdulla. Abdulla has atoned for his mistakes [by submitting quietly to the chastise ment given him by Sheikh Ali. If Mr. Bahnson had followed the proper course he would not have been assaulted, and therefore I do not think I can support his claim for personal pecuniary compensation, but it is of course a very grave offence for an Asiatic to assault a European without just provocation, and I shall insist on the coolies whom he can identify on oath as having struck him being punished by the Sheikh of Bahrein. I think that a month’s imprisonment would be the most suitable form of punishment. As regards Sheikh Ali I believe that a formal apology tendered to yourself and Mr. Bahnson for his unlawful intrusion upon, and actions on your premises made either before Sheikh Isa and myself at Moharrag or before myself and the Wazier at your house would meet the requirements of the case. It is of course well understood in the Islands that no employes of Europeans can be legally impressed by other persons, and therefore it is not necessary to issue any new orders on the lines of your third suggestion.12 These are the views I have formed on the ease, and if you acquiesce in them, I think, I shall be able to bring the affair to a speedy conclusion. If you are not satisfied it will be necessary to await definite orders from' my superior officer, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who will return to Bushire from the interior of Persia on or about the 20th November next. Enclosure No. 9. Dated Bahrein, the SOth October 190t. From— Herr Robert Wonckhaus, To Captain F. B. Prideafx, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. Your letter, dated 28th instant, was duly received by me. I cannot agree to what you say that “ there have been errors of judgment and improper actions on both sides . ^ At least as far as Mr. Bahnson is concerned, I venture to have a different opinion and concerning the action of my man Abdullah I do not think that blame is to be attached to his behaviour. You yourself admit that the first mistake of course was committed by the man of 8heikh Ali bin Ahmed refusing to give up the firm’s bag to my man Abdullah. I believe that this was not the first mistake committed by the Sheikh’s man; the first mistake was undoubtedly that he pressed a coolie employed by me and that he stuck (sic) to him though he was told in a very polite way by my servant Abdullah that if Sheikh Ali wanted some coolies he might only send over and ask me for some as a favour. According to your idea Abdullah “erred still more seriously when he endeavoured to recover the bag by force, used language which was calculated to accentuate the quarrel and ended by striking the Sheikh’s servant with the latter s own stick.” This I believe is not quite correct j I should think that if a man takes away property of mine and be it only an empty bag he is a thief and I do not see the reason why a man should not try to recover his lawful property from a thief by taking it away from him even by force if necessary. &lt; £ i n0 ^ cer ^ a ^ n Abdullah was the first man to use language Wa f calculated to accentuate the quarrelon the contrary, he asserts that it was the Sheikh s man who used offensive language and who was even the first one to attack. Abdullah had only touched the bag so far and not the man at all. That withe fight which ensued Abdullah proved the stronger, managed aVj i? -u 6 pheikh’s man’s stick away from him and struck the man with it, Abdullah quite admits, but I do not think it fair to blame a man when being attacked first, for his getting the best of the fight. At &lt; this point Mr. Bahnson was assisted by another servant of the Sheikh to terminate the fight, and if matters had ended here, the whole affair would not have been ot much importance, and I venture to think that even at this time the balance would not at all be in favour of the Sheikh’s man. If you have been told by somebody that my man Abdullah has an overbear ing manner that somebody does not seem to be a competent judge of it. This servant of mine is with me for six years and I daresay I can claim more know- edge or ms character and manners than any outsider, and I can honestly wfih peopl ^ ^ aVe lieVer no ^ ce ^ an overbearing manner of his in his dealings The fact of ^ Abdullah’s submitting to the unjustified hiding (sic) he received from Sheikh Ali without striking in his turn does not seem to me to bear out your presumption of his having an overbearing manner. I must say that I and with me probably most people have noticed that more or less all the servants of the different Sheikhs of this place do possess an overbearing manner. This fact is borne out by the stories and threats against Europeans generally which have been started by some of Ali bin Ahmed’s people in these days after the affair. So much for this less important part of the affair. What happened after this seems to me to be such a serious misbehaviour of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmedand Ms people that I am sorry to say I cannot at all share your views which you formed on the case. Since I have given you all the details of the matter in my first letter to you and since from your answer it appears that you have quite satisfied yourself as to the literal correctness of my narrative* I do not think it necessary to mention these happenings over again; I only wish to rectify some errors of yours. Firstly, you say you “do not believe that Sheikh Ali himself had any intention of causing Mr. Bahnson to be beaten/’ As for this it will not be possible to ascertain what really Sheikh Ali’s intentions were, but Mr. Bahnson who ought to be able to judge best by the Sheikh’s behaviour at that time and I myself are absolutely unshaken in our belief (which by the by is shared by a good many people) that Sheikh Ali was the instigator of the assault on Mr. Bahnson. If you think “ it is difficult to say whether the servants struck him acci dentally or through exasperation at his intervention ” I think you might take it for granted that there could be no question of accident as Mr. Bahnson has not been hidden (sw) once or twice or even three times accidentally, but Mr. Bahnson affirms emphatically that he has been systematically beaten. The question of it having occurred accidentally is quite out of possibility. What their motives were I myself have no doubts. I do not believe either that it was caused by “ exasperation at his intervention.” The large wound which Mr. Bahnson sustained in this assault luckily did not prove to be of serious consequences, but I can assure you that all the same Mr. Bahnson lost pounds and pounds of blood; in fact, before I bandaged his wound, Mr. Balmson on account of loss of blood when lying in the easy chair nearly fainted, but still I agree with you that his “ sense of dignity was even more seriously hurt.” If it appears to you that the coolie was not very much hurt, I and everybody with me, who saw the man, will be of different opinion. The man was sick afterwards and was laid up for more than a week being unable to work and even now he is unable to do heavy work he had to do before the assault. The fraqas had just subsided when I arrived on the scene and it is quite true that Sheikh Ali accompanied me upstairs, but if you conclude from that that he left me again “ on getting some idea of the terms which you contemplated demanding of him ” and that he thought them unreasonable, you are mistaken, since neither I nor anybody else spoke a single word to him about terms or compensation or anything of that sort. I invited him to sit down which he did for about a minute or two whilst I bandaged Mr. Bahnson’s wound. I only addressed him with a few words asking him to tell me how the matter had come about. It was only when Mr. Gaskin had arrived in my house that the question of compensation or terms was raised by Mr. Gaskin by addressing Mr. Bahnson, and it was only then that the proposed terms were fixed. I may add here that when the Sheikh was spoken to by Mr. Gaskin his behaviour was of such a kind as to show clearly that he did not regret the affair at all and Mr. Gaskin himself remarked “ he is not at all apologetic ”. 'While Sheikh Ali was sitting down I sent a second man to Mr. Gaskin to inform &gt; him the first messenger having been sent by Abdullah before Mr. Bahnson went downstairs but was overtaken by the second one. When the Sheikh heard me mention Mr. Gaskin’s name he got angry and left in spite of my invitations to wait until Mr. Gaskin had arrived; on the contrary, he said if anything was wanted of him they would know where to find him. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s behaviour after having come upstairs with me was not at all apologetic. In fact, he did show an overbearing manner at that time/ n - I now come to what you call “an error of judgment committed by Mr. Bahnson by going down into the Melee When Mr. Bahnson heard the row downstairs it was his duty to go down and to see what was going on m my house; when coming downstairs he saw that an innocent coolie employed by me was being brutally beaten by several of Sheikh Ali’s men, it was again his du y to interfere and tell them to stop this; or do you expect Mr. Bahnson or meto quietly look on when an employee of mine, who is absolutely innocent, is being brutally maltreated in my own house by a set of people who entered my house without my consent ? I think some blame might have attached to Mr. Bahnson if he had tried only to touch any of these people or if he had only used strong language, but nothing of this was done by Mr. Bahnson. He simply asked them to stop immediately and stretched his arms over the unfortunate coolie naturally presuming that this would effectively stop the proceeding. 1 fail to see where the error of judgment on Mr. Bahnson’s part comes in. It appears to me that you seem to think very lightly about Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and his followers and his servants entering my house without my consent and behaving as if he had a right to let my employees be beaten by himself and his servants. If Sheikh Ali thought, after the first affair between his man and Abdullah had happened, that he had reason to complain, he ought to have followed another course which was open to him either by informing me of it by settling the matter amicably or by directing himself to the Chief of Bahrein. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s highhandedness in the first instance and alone is the real cause of the unfortunate affair, and I venture to say that if he is not made to pay dearly for it some way or the other this time, in future his respect for all Europeans generally will be nil and this might lead to further occurrences of a similar kind if not worse. I thank you very much for what you say regarding the Sukhra system* It does not contain any point which has not been known to me since long. Of course, it is “ well understood in the islands that no employee of Europeans can legally be impressed by other persons,” but if it is so well under stood why do these things always and ever happen again ? I myself have had to complain of it several times to your predecessor Mr. Gaskin, and more than a dozen times it has happened, and I have not troubled anybody with it because I got tired to complain always of such more trifling matters which nevertheless are very annoying and can lead to serious conse quences as shown by this affair. I venture to say it is not good enough that everybody in the islands only understands that European employees are free of Sukhra, but the people, especially the servants of all the Sheikhs of the islands, must be made to obey, and if they do not, they ought to be punished somehow. The opinion which you have formed on the case and the terms you propose are so widely different from what I think to be right, that I fear that an under standing about this matter between you and myself will be very difficult. I therefore propose to send in by this mail to the German Consul in Bushire the correspondence regarding the affair, and I shall put the whole matter into his hands for settlement. Enclosure No. 10. Dated the 5th November 1904. From— Herr Robert Wonckhaus, To—C aptain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. With reference to my letter dated 30th October, I regret that I have to report to you another case regarding the “ Sukhra ” which happened to-day. My coolies were employed in bringing wood from the boat into my godown when a man of Sheikh Hamad bin Isa got hold of one of them, struck him when the coolie refused to come along with him, stating that he was working for me. The coolie succeeded to get the man of the Sheikh to come into my godown where my man Abdunabi told the Sheikh’s man that the coolie was employed by me, and that he might look out for another one. But even now the Sheikh’s man did not want to leave the coolie alone and it was necessary that Mr. Bahnson himself told the Sheikh’s man accordingly. Of course, the matter is important enough to complain about it, but I only want to show you that it is not at all understood, that my coolies cannot be taken by the Sheikh’s man, i.e., that the Sheikh’s people in any case do not act accordingly.15 I do not doubt that some of the Sheikhs have the good will not to take my coolies, but I know that the servants and followers of the Sheikhs do not mind it at all. It is, of course, of no consequence, but I only want to state that the Sheikh’s man showed an overbearing manner by speaking loudly and big and even mentioned to my clerk Abdunabi that he would complain to the Sheikh about him and about me. In fact, he acted as if he thought to be in his right by taking the coolie although the same was employed by me. J This shows again how little the Sheikh’s people grasp the situation. No. 259, dated the 7th November 1904. From—C aptain F. B. Frideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Sheikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, Bahrein. I received a letter from Mr. Eobert Wonckhaus, the German, complaining that on the 5th instant one of Sheikh Hamad bin Isa’s servants was forcibly trying to take away one of the German’s coolies while the man was bringing wood from a boat to the German’s godown,—that on the coolie refusing to follow the Sheikh’s man the latter struck him and followed him up to the German’s godown where the German’s man Abdunabi told Sheikh Hamad’s servant that the coolie was in the service of the German, but he would not hear of it and did not leave the coolie alone until he was told to do so by Mr. Bahnson. To prevent similar regrettable incidents in future I request that orders may be re-issued to all the Sheikhs and Amirs to the effect that no coolies in the employ of Europeans can be forcibly taken away by any one. The system of “ Sukhra ” is regarded, as you may well understand, by the British Government as objectionable in the same manner as is slavery. Every instance which brings to notice the oppression entailed by this system must, therefore, ultimately affect the interests of the persons who profit by its existence, and this fact I think might well be instilled into their minds. Dated the 10th November 1904. From— Sheikh Isa bin Alt al Khalifah, Bahrein, To— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. I received your letter. You state that Mr. R. Wonckhaus wrote to you on the 5th instant that my son’s servant was trying to take away forcibly one of the German’s coolies and that on the coolies refusing to obey the servant struck him. I have now to inform you that orders were long ago issued to the Sheikhs and Amirs forbidding them to impress coolies in the service of the German as well as of others of similar standing. The Germans as well as others of similar position have no authority what ever over the poor coolies that work along the seashore and when they are taken for work by the Sheikh’s servants they are paid their hire. I do not, however, desire that they should be taken forcibly. I understand that Mr. Bahnson invents these stories for your information. I do not like all these things as much as you would not like them. I hope you will not take these complaints as true. • No. 260, dated the 10th November 1904. From— Captain F. B. Pridealx, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Herr Robert Wonckhaus, Bahrein, With reference to your letter dated the 5th instant, I have the honour to inform you that the Chief of Bahrein, in reply to a letter I wrote to him on theI fV 16 subject of the recent action of Sheikh. Hamad’s servant, has stated that he does not recognize the custom of £f Sukhra, and that he cannot believe that any one of his relatives or officials would ever contemplate impressing your coolies. I am hopeful that my letter will have the effect of saving you from further annoyance on this point. Enclosure No. 11. Translation of a letter from the German Consul at Bushire, dated the 19th October 1904, to Sheikh Isa bin Alt al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein. 1 have been lately informed that the servants and coolies of Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali, your nephew, struck Mr. Bahnson, a German, in the service of Herr R. Wonckhaus at Bahrein on the head inflicting a severe cnt, but that up to now you have not punished the culprits. I therefore request you to enquire into the affair with a view to compensating Mr. Bahrison at an early date and punishing the offenders with a flogging before the public. Translation of Sheikh Isa’s reply, dated the 7th November 1904, to the German Consul at Bushire. I received your letter, dated 19th October 1904, and learnt that you have, been informed of the dispute between my nephew, Ali bin Ahmed, and Mr. Bahnson, the German. I have now to inform you that this matter is before the British Government and I cannot say anything on the subject, t Enclosure No. 12. Extract from a letter No. 270, dated 17th November 1904, from Captain F. E. Ppideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Foliiical Besident in the Persian Gulf. To console himself for the slight which he considers put upon himself, Sheikh Ali has formed around his person a body-guard of big men, mostly negroes who are a terror to all quietly disposed residents in the Bazaar and whorn I believe no man in the Chief’s entourage dares touch. Nearly all the men who are implicated in the Bahnson affair have now also taken part in this ^ more recent case. It may be that Sheikh Isa is unwalling to see the family dignity injured through the punishment even of a nephew who is disloyal to himself, but I firmly believe now that my predecessor Mr. Gaskin’s view also is correct that the Chief dare not attempt to exercise authority over Sheikh Ali. The fact that Sheikh Ali is disloyal at any rate in thought to his uncle is proved by his saying to me when he called at the Agency to welcome my arrival that if he had the share in the Government, which his father had held, he would be happy to use his influence towards the proper reformation of the Customs administration. 12. I now have to make the following recommendations. In the absence of a British gunboat it is certain that no punitive measures will be submitted to by Sheikh Ali and his gang either in the Wonckhaus case or the present pne. I hope that as quickly as possible a gunboat may be sent here, and, if possible, allow~ed to remain here during the month of Bamzan, as I am not too confident that even the Hindu community will be safe much longer. 18. I think that on the arrival of the man-of-war Sheikh Ali should _ be summoned on board with all his male servants. Mr. Bahnson might be invited on board and asked to identify the men who were concerned in the assault on himself. All such who may be known to have taken part also in the later affair should be soundly flogged on board, then sent to Moharrag for one year’s imprisonment and then expelled from the islands, in the event of security for good behaviour not being forthcoming. I think such action on our part as this is justified by the Chief’s weakness and actively wrongful attitude. -14. Sheikh Ali should he banished from Bahrein and preferably made to reside at Aden for at least 10 years. His brothers can administer his properties and remit him the proceeds. The oM “ G-oyernment House ” should, however, be made over at a valuation to the Chief for the use of his son Sheikh Hamad. 15. Finally, Sheikh Isa, I think, should be told emphatically that no disputes between Shiahs and Sunnis are henceforth to be referred to the Shera Court, an y more than disputes between Hindus and Muhammadans are. The Shiahs w lf 0 are mostly Persians, in the^ absence of the Shah’s Consular representatives, naturally look to us for protection, and as the British Government are interested in the welfare of all classes in Bahrein, they cannot view with equanimity the iniustice even of making Bahreini Shiahs (who are all Persians by origin) submit to the jurisdiction of a religious court other than their own. All such cases should be adjudicated upon by the Chief himself or by an impartial Mejlis. Enclosure No. 13. Translated purport of a telegram from the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, Teheran, to the Persian Traders in Bahrein. I received your telegram regarding the assault on you by the Bahrein Arabs. Keep yourselves calm, for I have had a long talk with the British Minister on the subject, and I am sure be will take early steps to get the affair settled and get the culprits punished. Enclosure No. 14 (Transiation.) Undertaking given to Resident by Sheikh of Bahrein, dated 28th Ramzan 1322. I, Sheikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, urge that my personal self respect and that of my family will be broken if Sheikh Ali is compelled to leave Manama immediately before the Bamzan Bed, which will be only 3 days hence. But I hereby give the most solemn undertaking possible that within 7 days after the departure of Major Cox from Bahrein, Sheikh Ali and his followers shall also leave Bahrein for change of air and shall remain away from Bahrein until such time as Major Cox shall receive a reply from Government, and if no_ such reply or instructions shall arrive up to 3 weeks (a month in all) Sheikh Ali shall be at liberty to return to Bahrein. And if the Resident will accept this arrangement, I promise and undertake to place special guards on the Bazaar, day and night, to such an extent as will satisfy Captain Prideaux, the Political Agent, so that there may be no possibility of a recurrence of rowdiness for the future.

Before commenting upon the correspondence forming the enclosures to this communication, I venture to record a few facts, or observations, which may perhaps be necessary to elucidate the general situation at Bahrein. ' ■ * The population of the Islands is composed of two distinct but equally important elements, namely 1 f a \ Sunni Mahommedans—Arabs with a sprinkling of Negroes, keeping up a constant and more or less migratory connection with the Arabs of the mainland. Among these is the family of the Ruling Chief which is of the Uttoobee tribe. (b) Shia Mahommedans, namely, “ Bahreinis that is, the old Bahrein stock, of somewhat uncertain origin. Out of the total island popu lation, which, if I remember right, is ^ estimated at about 70,000 souls, the proportion of the two denominations is ah out equal, the Bahreinis being a little in the majority. In the population of Manama are included between 50 and 100 Persian subjects engaged in unpretentious trade and mostly owning small shops m the Bazaar. They are, I need hardly mention, of the Shia persuasion. It will be realised that they form an infinitesimal part of the Manama com munity and like our own Indian traders, were it not for the measure ot Pax Britannica which the presence of a British representative assures to them, they could hardly trade or reside in complete security in such surroundings even at ordinary times, 3. Chiefist among these Persians is one Haji Abdul Nabi, w o con uc s the cargo-landing business on behalf of the person who farms e y for that work: from the Sheikh, namely, the Vazier Abdurra man. months past the said Vazier has been away on the Mecca Pilgrimage, and dm rip his absence Abdul Nabi has conducted the work with full powers principal. -o i v r He is also employed to some extent by Messrs. Hray^ au _ and is at the same time the authorised contractor for the prov isioning 0 ^ men-of-war when stationed at Bahrein. Abdul Nabi may emiei * less scrupulous than others of his stamp, but the British India Comp y o informed me that from their point of view lie is a satisfactory man, , during his conduct of the cargo-landing business, they had experie ► , less of the petty thieving from packages of merchandise m transi , formerly been very prevalent. , Three months ago it appears that this Abdul Nabi had persona y race^ and run to earth a gang of Arab house and boat thieves and a the discovery of a quantity of stolen goods at their lodging. ig three in consequence imprisoned, of whom five were subsequently re still remain in confinement. In consequence of this occurrence •. j on went for some days afterwards in fear of his life, and though t a PP. ., tg had gradually past off, he was well aware at the time that the pre , g Q £ arose that he was not a persona grata among the less law-a i o ,. ^ the Arab population of Manama, in which category it seems that bheum his retainers had come to occupy a predominant position. . . , 4. Having got thus far I may well leave Captain Prideaux s r P to furnish the details of the fracas which occurred on i4th November la . In this communication he states clearly the details of a y a il- ascertained immediately afterwards from the best sources o in testimony able; and his account receives circumstantial corroboration from Ji Hd Hn -rv TVinnis of the American Mission, who attended to the injured. I think it may be accepted at all events as placing the incident in the light in which it was presented the following morning to every “ man m the street not actuahy concerned in it, and except in one or two minor matters of detail, I have httle doubt that it represents the correct version of what took place. 5 It was obviously useless to expect any of the injured members of the small Persian community to testify openly to the names of persons whom they h“d recognized in the mob, for fear of subsequent consequences to themselves, but Captain Prideaux, making inquiries from them and others confidentially, ascer- tained the names and identity of some 25 persons who had been recognized among the mob. Among these were several retainers of Sheikh All, some of whom bad been concerned in the assault upon the German trader a short time before. There can be no doubt that the origin of the disturbance was a pure accident and in no way connected with religion ; when once started the attack was extended to the unpopular Abdul Nabi and his family and ^employes, and eventually the religious cry was taken up, and every Mogul who was unfortunate enough to appear on the scene was immediately set upon and 6. After the occurrence those Persians who had shops in the Bazar closed them, and fearing from the Sheikh’s attitude that he did not intend to listen to Gaptam Prideaux but would try and get their case burned before the local Sunni Shariat, they sent over a telegram to His Majesty the Shah asking or supper . The Mushir-ud-Dowleh replied that the British authorities had undertaken to see justice done. Meanwhile, Captain Trevor, my Pint Assistant, -was able to secure the despatch of His Majesty’s Ship “Hedbreast to Mana p s mv arrival there. • . 7. On reaching Bahrein on 30th November, I found that the Persian shops were still closed and that the only development since the Politica £ en , .. No. 272 of 19th November (Enclosure No. 2) was the departure o . and his entourage,—including many of the rowdies “ wanted, for a 3 excursion on the mainland behind Bahrein. _ As I mentioned in my report on the assault upon the German subject, ei Esa’s attitude led me to anticipate some difficulty in settling the second case, ana I feared that if both were handled together, the first case might be 1UT v i leaiea xnar u uom uciuuicu uu 0 du-l^a, 0 . ,, ii. conjunction with it. I therefore decided to abstain from intervention m of the Sunni-Shia affray until I had done what I could in the Gennan cas The latter occupied me till the evening of the 4th December. December 4th .—On that afternoon when I told Skeikh Esa that I ready to take up the inquiry in the second case and make the inves 1 o which he had invited me to do, he produced from his pocket s testimony PP (Istishhad) executed by one of the two chief Sunni Mullahs in whic ^ of persons purported to have testified that they had seen Persians ° Arabs. , In handing me this document the Chief said that this was the tostim°ny complaint of his Arab subjects and he begged that I would see ice • I replied that the “ istishhad ” was of little use to me by itself and t a , want to see all the persons mentioned in it and examine them. He acqm &gt; and it having been decided that I should start the inquiry at _ morning, he promised to keep his younger son Abdulla in Manama wit 11 ^ tions to send to me any of his subjects whom I might wish to examine, depute his elder son or his acting Yazier to represent him at the procee mg • ^ 8. December 5th .—The Persian witnesses who had been directed themselves were ready at the appointed time 8 a.m., but I was kept wai i b 4 hours for the Sheikh’s representative. Eventually Sheikh Earned, the 8 » ^ the acting Vazier Shereideh put in an appearance, and the former ^ ^ that Shereideh had been deputed to attend on the Chief s behalf. Tor see correspondence ending with this Office No. 48 of 4th March 1901. ^ He went on to say, however, that it would not he practicable for ^ witnesses to present themselves for examination by me, for m the fir^ ¥ they would not appear in the presence of the Shias and in the second ttie)dismayed by the punishment awarded to Sheikh Ali’s servants the day before. I endeavoured to explain to Sheikh Hamed the sanctity of a British Court and the unreasonableness of this attitude, pointing out that his father had parti cularly asked me to make this personal inquiry and now that I was beginning to do so he refused to send me the men whom I might want to see. I failed, however, to make any impression upon his ignorant obstinacy and finally told’him that I could not afford to waste more time and must at any rate it on with examination of the Persians to-day and would like to inter- view°his father on the morrow as provisionally arranged, both in order to pro nounce the warning to Sheikh Ali in his presence regarding his departure from Bahrein and then to show him (Sheikh Esa) the results of to-day’s inqui ries into the Arab-Persian case. Hamed then returned to Muharrag and the Vazier Shereideh remained while I recorded the statements of the Persian sufferers. I gave him every opportunity to put questions and cross-examine and his behaviour gave me no cause to complain. v ^ . Conies of statements accompany (Enclosure No. 6) and I request perusal of them but in view of what follows it seems unnecessary to discuss the^ details of them’at this point, and t will therefore dismiss them with the obserTation that in most cases the wounds and injuries of the witnesses and the medical evidence afforded corroboration of the general truth of their story and proof of the severity of the attack made upon them. 9 . The examination of these witnesses took me till late in the evening. December 6(6.— Next morning Captain Prideaux and 1 J isi . te &lt;* Shelkh Isa He being an old man and feeling discomfort from the cold wind and sea on the journey over from Maharrag, we had offered to visit him instead of asking him to come over again. His two sons and Sheikh Ali were present, and after ^e.exchange of greetings with the Sheikh, I proceeded to explain my views to Sheikh Ah to the necessity of his leaving Bahrein forthwith with his unruly followers. He replied that he had no other course open to him than to accept such arrangements as Sheikh Esa and I might come to with regard to him. Thereupon tile Chief proceeded to speak stoutly in defence of his nephew, but how far his attitude was genuine and how far assumed m order to save face before his nephew I am unable to say. The drift of his Mg u “ e ™ s thnr his nenhew had been sufficiently punished by the fine of El,000 and the flogging of his servants and that he had done nothing to deserve the d^grace of expulsion and was entirely under his uncle s orders. [As to the fine, 1 fear it must have been paid by feheikh Esa himself.J After some concessions on either side he was at last induced to accept the draft[ written onlhcfspot, of the undertaking which forms -^h nrolid^d previous report (No. 420, dated 17th December 1904) and w^ch provided that Sheikh Ali should remain for the Bed and then absent tas entourage for three weeks pending receipt of the or 10. This matter having been disposed of, we went on to discuss the Arab- P, T 'rr Hamed's ?&lt; that Arabs would not be sent to me for examma i ’ 0 £ attitude, explain to Sheikh Esa, as I had to his unreason ^ w ki C h were I went on to say that 1 had now heard all ^ e t ^ rS ^ ere ^ being an old man of fully borne out by their wounds, (one of the m f Ipf me examine 80 who was nearly battered to death) and that, as e , i to me am i a il the Arabs, I must form my opinion on the evidence ^ akle to \V“Ls which that now remained for me to do was to explain my 1 ,, ^. ers an( j should be taken to punish the offenders and compen^^sutteiem. ^^ discuss them with the Sheikh with a new to t le g indicated to Sheikh Esa what my views were (see enclosure IN . I- At the same time 1 explained that whilo tnese vvere roy p • t; ir [ 1 was. quite ready, as long as I found him prepared to do substantial justicegome form, to meet him half way in any reasonable suggestionor to refer his proposals to Government. In reply he proceeded to fall back again upon the argument that I had only listened to the Persian version, and had not accepted the statement of the Arabs as recorded in the Istishhad which he had given me. Again I explained to him that such an Istishhad, drawn up as it was by a Sunni Mulla, could not be accepted by any British Court or officer, unattested or unsupported, and without an opportunity of cross-examining the persons men tioned therein, and that this opportunity he had at the last minute refused to give me. After some argument he ended by saying that he was now willing to send to me all the eye-witnesses for examination, but could not agree to send any person who had been concerned in the affray itself. I knew very well that if these witnesses came now they would come thoroughly primed as to what to say; at the same time I did not think it was advisable to give the Sheikh any excuse for saying that I had refused any advance of his and therefore expressed my willingness to hear any one whom he sent me on the morrow, and asked him to send his representative as before. We then took leave. 11. December 7th .—Sheikh Ahmed and Shereideh duly presented them selves, together with the persons mentioned on the Istishhad. I proceeded to examine them. Sheikh Hamed was very obstructive at first. I had given him a seat on my right facing the witnesses, and he seemed to imagine that I was going to let each witness rattle off the statement he had come prepared with, and when I proceeded to elicit their statements by interrogation in the ordinary way, he persistently interrupted with attempts to put words into the witnesses mouths or to prevent them from saying something of a committing nature. I bore with him for some time with a good deal of longsuffering, but was finally obliged to ask him to sit to one side and behind the witnesses and to reserve his communications and cross-examination of each witness till I had finished with him. This had the desired effect and I was able to carry on with less interruption. I examined nine that day and the remaining two the following morning. Copies of their statements are attached (Enclosure 7), but they are worth very little. One and all came in with the idea above mentioned that they would be allowed to rattle off the statement which they had evidently been tutored in. In any case they were obviously sent there for a purpose, namely, to give proof that it was the Persians who attacked the Arabs, and that was the chief point that they were anxious to make clear. The statements of some of them, however, under examination rather corroborated than otherwise the opposite view and I may point out that in spite of the Sheikh’s argument that it was the Arabs who were attacked, not a single Arab was or has been produced who suffered the slightest injury nor do the Arab witnesses seriously maintain that any did come to real harm. The bad sight arising from neglected eye disease of the young man Ramzan lends probability to the story given by him as to the origin of tiie fracas, and though it is possible that, after the collision with the Seedie, Ramzan rounded on him and struck the first blow, yet the same bad sight from which Ramzan suffers makes that supposition less probable than the other. There is no doubt, however, that the collision referred to was the origin of the row, and whether the Seedie struck the first blow or the Persian, we °know that in the result two Persians, both perfectly harmless individuals 5 and one a decrepit octogenarian, were very nearly killed, and seven others severely beaten. To one perusing the statements of the witnesses, it will I have no doubt suggest itself in several places that another person mentioned might have been called or that a particular point wanted judicially clearing up. It must be remembered, however, that after each sitting I interviewed Sheikh Esa and that his attitude gave me little reason to hope that my examination of witnesses at all was likely to be anything more than a farce owing to his impossible attitude.12. December 8th .—After taking two more statements of persons who had got tired of waiting and had absconded the day before, I proceeded with Captain Prideaux to Muharrag to see the Sheikh. I was prepared for difficulty in bringing him round but uot for the change of front which we now experienced. - I began by telling him that I had examined all his witnesses as desired and asked bi n what impression his son and Vazier had given him of the nadure of their testimony. He replied that they had duly posted him. ' I then showed him the file of statements that I had brought and asked him whether he would like to have them translated to him now or whether I could leave an interpreter with him to do it at leisure. He said no : ; he did not want them read or translated, he could call for the men himself if he wanted to hear their statements. I replied that in that case all tiiat remained to be done was for me to give him my opinion on the case; and with his permission I proceeded to do so. 13. I explained that the only point on which the evidence of the Arabs seemed to throw any doubt was as to whether after the collision in the street it was the Persian or the Arab boy who struck the first blow ; that that point did not seem to be of the first importance and was certainly no excuse for the murderous attack which had been made on a whole fapaily including an, unfortunate old greybeard who had been innocently wending his way home after his long ftamzan day in his shop. I continued that in spite of his allegation and the Mullah s Istishhad to the effect that it was the Arabs who had been attacked and had suffered, not a single wounded man was produced or wound proved, nor was there a trace of any. It was altogether contrary to probability that this one family of merchants and men of peace (Abdu Nabi’s), part of an exceedingly small community of Persians, should for a moment dare to get up a concerted attack upon Arabs m an Arab town of some thousands of inhabitants. I thought there was no getting over the fact that a serious offence had been committed by a number of roughs among his subjects and that it was incum bent upon him as a ruler to set aside his religious prejudices and have adequate jhstice meted out. . ( : Id. I then repeated to him the measures which I had proposed to him before (.Enclosure 9) and also re P eate ^ 1 was advice way in regard to any detail, if he was generally prepared to accept my advice. ■? His reply to this must be noted. _ “ I have only one answer to give, namely, that I will do nothing m is case except after trial by my own Shariat or Urf Court. ^ I pointed out to him (as I Shariat) that this was no case toi the bnariat, p y Ahmad would be the Sunni Mullahs, Sheikh Jassim and his brother Stoikh Ah a , who were themselves more or less mixed up in is a wi complained case in this instance, as he had been told before, e , n -justice done and to their Government, which had officia l asked n^ ^ see ice do^and that he might take my word for it that in this case at all ^ev nt “ Government would not consider that justice would be done by a “ the local Mullahs. Moreover, no Mahommedan con ® refused to take that Shariat Court if he did not wish, and the Persians a so J ^resent informa- curse. I explained to him that it did not mean ao tion went, taking the Persians out of Ins jumdic ion o • Jinn. Mm that ; As to his “ Ur!” or Civil Court, I might be excused orvem^him,that no properly constituted Court of that nature exis e itr * cou pi be found to could not agree that after what had passed any sui a P confidence could form one, upon wnose integrity and intention to do justice any conhaenee ,c . P The Sheikh, however, was quite obdurate, an ^®^J;J® t n “ n i th qii“ S wHh Captain Prideaux will bear me witness that I . was s ^j ym not to cone to him and continued for a long time endeavoiirin p y ^ would show a deadlock with me, but to agree to any sort of compromise wmenGovernment tlistt 8.t sill g vents lie did not intend to be insnbordin8,te to tbem even though he could not agree with their representative. I suggested the deposit of even Us. 1,000 at the Agency and the detention of six of the ringleaders pending reference to Government. But he would have none of it, and added what amounted to this: “ If Government wish to seize Bahrein even, their arm is lono* and they can do it; but I will under no circumstances consent to the trial of these Persians by any tribunal but my own courts.” 15. It will thus be seen that he had ceased to argue as to the merits of the case itself, or that only one side had been heard, but had altered his position and was standing out on the question of his jurisdiction over the Persians, a point which he had discussed with Captain Prideaux in the first instance, but had subsequently dropped. Having quite failed to alter his demeanour, I told him I much regretted that we had arrived at a deadlock and could no more than report the fact to Government; and then took leave. We had been with him over two hours. 16. I remained in Bahrein the following day, as it was the Ramzan Eed and it seemed possible that some recrudescence of rowdyism might occur, but all went off quietly and I left for Bushire on 10th December, leaving H. M. S. Redbreast there. This completes the narrative of the progress of the case. It now remains for me to offer some comment where it seems called for and to make recommenda tions for the future for the consideration of the Government of India. 17. Though the Sheikh finally made the question of jurisdiction the bar to any settlement, I doubt myself whether it was really so in fact and think the real state of the case was that, having heard from his son and his Vazier that the Arab witnesses had fallen to pieces in a great measure, and gathering at all events that they had failed to impress me and that he would therefore no longer be able to argue with me regarding the merits of the case itself, and being unwill ing, or unable, owing to the influence of Sheikh Ali and the'Mullahs in Manama, to impose any punishment on the Arabs, he had determined to fall back on the question of jurisdiction. Upon this question of jurisdiction generally I hardly know what the opinion of the Government of India will be. To the best of my belief (and this view is 1 supported offhand by members of the Residency Staff), we have interfered to protect Persians before, but time does not admit of my verifying this from my records before the mail leaves. Personally I unhesitatingly express the view that as we have a virtual Protectorate over Bahrein, it is politically necessary and advisable that we should protect Persiaos (Shiahs), as well as other foreigners, at all events to the extent of preventing the perpetration of injustice upon them. In the present case I can hardly doubt, in view of the communications which have passed between this office, the Tehran Legation and the Persian * E&amp;cioaures 2.3 and 4 . Government,* that the Government of India will decide that it is necessary to afford protection. 18. I now come to the attitude of the Sheikh. The personal position, i.e., as between the Sheikh and Resident, is that after agreeing to await my arrival for the settlement of the case, and after pressing me to make personal inquiries into it, and after I had been to the trouble of doing as he requested, he absolutely refused to consider the evidence seriously or to meet my views to any extent whatever, and took refuge with a stubbornness, which was almost insulting, in the question of jurisdiction which he had previously dropped. This aspect of the question is of minor importance, and I merely place it on record. 19. The fact, however, that he should feel able to act in such a way has, in my opinion, a much more sinister significance, and my ten days’ enforced sojourn in Bahrein has brought me to the conclusion that the position there is very unsatisfactory indeed. In Sheikh Esa we have a Chief who owes his existence, his position, and his maintenance in that position entirely to us. More than that, in his interests1 we toot the unusual step of recognizing his son Hamed as his heir, strengthen his hands. in order to 0 rengmeu mo Considering these facts, and considering also the time that he has been in close relations with a British representative, both he and his son Hamed seem to me to he altogether unable to appreciate either their obligations to the British Government which has fathered them, or their own obligations to themselves as rulers. Sheikh Esa, living as he does over at Maharrag is so weak, or so disin clined to bear the sometimes inconvenient responsibilities of a ruler, that his representative in Manama, known as the Bazaar Master, has become necessarily a powerless individual, overawed by Sheikh Ali and those whom he employs or protects, and cannot keep Manama in order. His son and heir Sheikh Hamed, who, I may mention, is by the same mother as his cousin or half-brother* Sheikh Ali and seems to be personally an overbearingly ignorant young man, has apparently no better appreciation of his present and prospective position than his father, and does not give much promise of being a more satisfactory Chief. 20. Sheikh Esa himself is full of years and I am not prepared to say that he is personally or actively willing either that Manama should become lawless, or that specific injustice should be perpetrated, but he is surrounded by evil advisers (e.ff., Mahomed Abdul Wahab, Vazier Sheradeh, and the Manama Mullahs Jassim and Ahmed), and there can be little doubt that on whole he is a very unsatisfactory ruler, and that Bahrein, as it is now, does the .Br t Government no credit as a principality over which it has for long exercised a virtual protectorate. In fact, I fear that the Revd. Mr- ^wemer was very far outside tbe mark when he wrote five or six years a 0 o, re 0 ardmg Bahrein:— , . , . w “Oppression, blackmail and bribery are universal, and except in °o - PP merce and the slave trade, English protection has brought about no reforms in tbe island.” 21 The auestion now to he practically considered is what further action Governi^nt^f^ndL^will'be^and can on^thraeforTmaie^ug^stions^egard- i^' ^t^reS we protect these Persians (and I do not see that we toleave the ^ tMnk we should gain little by deposing Sheikh Esa and puttigph for the latter is I fear too old now to be moulded auy way, ana himself will certainly be as unsatisfactory as his father. ^rhaos Short of proclaiming a full British P'^^fbe ttsl^ne P of S create alarm at the present time the only couise w { whom there are sons of Sheikh Esa’s deposed Uncle, Mahommed-bin-KhaUta.mj ^ ^ ^ many living and some said to be promising. P binding treaty with us sous and the appointment of asonof b “S not suit the would he a simple matter, but again, such a step may pernaps policy of Government at this juncture. QT „i +o coerce railing that, the only alternative is to make the besto ^ sa ^ ^ dec;sioQ him in the present case by obliging him to car y j or refractory of Government in the matter and to pay a ne Jfahommed-hin- behaviour. We might also threaten to replace him by one oi ma Khalifa’s descendants. lalifa’s descendants. &lt; . . n , there is i think something 22. Captain Prideaux is of opinio , i i at the change of in it, that the Sheikh had perhaps become alarmed at^^ ^ ^ Goveril - Agents at Bahrein, and had connected it wi a i nc ii ne d him to stand on ment of India to take over h^Cns^an^ «Shdkb Alunel, and bore him Ab. bbe was * (Note. -The mother was first married to Ah s fattier, Sheik bj him and afterwards married Sheikh Esa, and bore llauae ,8 the defensive in this recent matter and form common cause with Sheikh All and that for this reason our disinterestedness might be suspected if the taking over of his Customs was allowed to become an item of onr punitive treat ment of him in the present connection. 0 r'S I admit that there is force in this. On the other hand, if we are going to 1 coerce the Chief, it would save a good deal of trouble to include the Customs question and have done with it, seeing that it has been troubling us so long/ 1 must leave the question in the hands of the Government of India. 23. I now only-have to discuss the means of coercion. The position in this connection is not quite so simple as it was when coercive action was last taken at Bahrein. There is now a considerable community of Europeans in Manama, viz., 12 or 15 Missionaries and two or three European traders, besides our Political Agent. In connection with the present case, the Sheikh who has no doubt been instigated all through by. the Mullahs Jassim and Ahmed, could if he liked arouse a good deal of fanatical feeling in the matter and this has to be taken into account. I do not think it would be advisable to propose any fresh terms or settlement to him without having at hand the means to enforce them on the spot, and at present we have not got them. H M. S. Redbreast, manned as she now is with a lascar crew and carrying only seven or eight bluejackets, would be of no use for any work on shore. In my opinion if it were intended ’to coerce the Sheikh or depose him it would be advisable and necessary to have a second ship of war present and to send a battalion of native infantry or at all events four companies to Bahrein to camp for the rest of the winter on the open ground outside the Agency, for the reassurance and safeguarding of the European community and of British subjects in general, until matters had settled down. -r. Although as I observed before I cannot foresee what view Government trill take of this case ab initio I have thought it advisable to write fully on all points which seem at all. likely to be involved. I may add that Captain Prideaux’s views coincided entirely with mine, throughout in regard to the attitude of the Sheikh, and when we parted neither of us had any hope that any solution short of coercion was possible. ? Writmg to me the day after my departure he mentioned that he had nothing fresh to report, only thait the Sheikh has closed all the coffee shops in the centre of&gt; the Bazaar, professedly to lessen the chances of disturbance, but, • i.e., on our advice on December. actually because they are , P. z. cox. a ll run by Persians who &lt; i cr , , , have only just* opened after' a closure of teee weeks The Arab coffee shops are nearer the outskirts of the town and have been allowed' to keep open.” * ; This is only another instance of his hostile attitude towards the Persian community. ; 25. There is one aspect of the question which I forgot to indicate in its proper' pace. i Tenture therefore to do so now. It bears on the question of the pro-'' lection of this Community of Persians. The matter, as mentioned rathe Wy of the. report, has already been dis-^ wn f 1£ tten we see substantial justice done to these subjects of' tffe Shah, tke fact of our hanng done so will, now and always, greatly strengthen the hands of H.s Majesty s Legatron, in pressing claims of ours and as au ins“ : tance of our general friendliness to the Shah’s Government and subnets ' The converse would also be the case. J ' _ _ 26. In an analogous connection with the above I may mention that I have this moment received an informal note from my German Colleague Herr Von Mutms regretting that owing to my being in quarantine he cannot see me personally in order to present you my best thanks for your efficient hdo to the German firm, which, I trust, settles the case.” ^ 27. 1 ^vo omitted also to mention that supposing that the Government of India agree to the deportation of Sheikh Ah (whichI look upon as of the first ■ ■importance) I recommend that the period should he not less than five years, if not for an indefinite period. 28. I beg to state in conclusion that this report has occupied me up to the last minute of the mail steamer’s presence, being typed sheet by sheet straight from my pen ; 1 shall consequently not be able to revise or alter anything, if it is to catch the mail, and this seems important. I therefore crave indulgence for any clerical errors or loose English of which I may have been guilty. Enclosure No. 1. No. 270, dated 17tli November 1904&lt; From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that on the evening of Monday, the 14th instant, a most serious assault was committed by the servants of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed al Khalifah and other Arabs on the family of Hap Abdul Nabi Kazerooni and other innocent Persians who chanced to fall in their way, with the result that two respectable Persians—the father and brother of Abdul Nabi—have been dangerously wounded and seven other Persians less seriously so. 2. The facts of the case, as reported by my Arab Mnnshi after thorough enquirv are as follows. The disturbance arose through a Persian servant of Haii Abdul Nabi and a Negro servant of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed brushing against each other in a narrow lane of the Bazaar unintentionally. The Negro Mariook turned furiouslv on the Persian Ramzan, and after the exchange of a few sentences knocked him down. Seeing other Persians about, he flew at them usin' his stick freely, and in a few moments others of his companions had commenced copying his example. Haji Abdul Nabi, who is the monopolist of the cargo-landing business, the contract for wmeh he ho ds under the Chief s Wazier Abdur Rahman, came running up to subdue the disturbance, but Ins influence failed to stand him in good stead, and he found himself compelled to flee hack to his house to save his life. By this time a number of Sunnis had mined in the excitement coming out of an adjacent mosque, the Mullah ot which was urging them to “kill, kill the moguls” and a number of others, including Sheikh Diaii bin Selman al Khalifa, whose three intimate relatives were the persons killed by the Begaih on the mainland m 1900, also came up from the house 'of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, Who is said to have hurried them forward though he kept out of sight himself. „ 3 Haii Abdul Nabi, pursued by au infuriated mob, was able to find safety i. 4s - —rhi d .“d' = were at all seriously hurt, though at the present moment an Istishhad_^s being circulated for signature amongst Ara s 0 hurt. were the aggressors and that a number of Ara s . 4.

I told hum that i wa ^ the of control under which his servants app _ Y w hi G li thev had been con- Resident’s decision regarding the previous case m ^ich they ha earned, when Mr. Bahnson, the Ge r“y’ as other Sheikhs, hut also because two or three days ago I ao .„ through Haii Abbas to the who reside in the Manamah Bazaar, a pnva , = did not approve of the effect that the Chief had written to me that ^ d d t ny in “Sukhra” (corve) system, and that « unlikely to get connection with it occurred in the futur P P support from Sheikh Isa.10 alart that the ringleaders, whom 1 named, were ms servants, ne said that the w^hole power to &amp; punish even his own (Sheikh All s) followers was wielded by the Chief Sheikh Isa, and he further alleged that if Sheikh Isa would have per mitted it he would have been glad to have tried to settle the case with the Germans’amicably out of Court At the end of our interview he promised to send five of the ringleaders over to Moharrag, where Sheikh Isa resides, early i Sheikh Ali commenced by denying that he received my message artel iat the ringleaders, whom I named, were his servants. He said that the .P pvrti his own (Sheikh All s) followers was w elderl ^ 6 During the night Sheikh Isa sent one of his head servants to Haji Abdul Nabi’s house and told him to rest assured that satisfaction would be given him, 7 In the morning, unaware of the last incident, I called on the Chief and sent word also to such of the sufferers as could move, to be present at the same time I believe that Sheikh Ali must also have been to the Chief before my arrival for I found Sheikh Isa’s attitude at first most obstinate. He declared that he would not admit any interference from me in cases between Arabs and Persians who were all Mahommedans, and said that he had made np his mind to have the present case settled by a Shara Court. I urged him to the best of my ability to hold the enquiry to himself as no Sunni Shara Court was in the least likely to do justice to Persians, and moreover the conduct of more than one of the A1 Khalifa family was seriously in question. I then observed that if the Chief ignored my advice in this matter he would be afterwards soriy for it, iust as 1 was sure he would regret not having allowed Sheikh Ali to compound the case which the Germans were pressing against him. The Chief replied that he had heard nothing of any advice given by me to Sheikh Ah, and when I told him that I had said that I thought that if Sheikh Ah wrote IVIr. Wonckhaus an apology of his own initiative and offered a fair sum of money as compensation to Mr. Bahnson, the Germans would not be backward in burying the hatchet; the Chief showed considerable signs of interest, and enquired what sum in my opinion would be acceptable to the German firm. This question I did not see my way to answer. The Chief aUhe close of our interview, in which other matters were also discussed, reiterated his declaration that justice would be done to the Persians, and I contented myself with saying that I should follow the course of the enquiry with interest. ^ I must not omit to mention that at the beginning of our interview the Chief declared he would not admit the wounded Persians into his presence, but before I left he did see them. K 8. On my return to my house I heard that the two chief ringleaders had again just been assaulting Persians in the Bazaar, that all the Persians in consequence were keeping their shops closed and that Sheikh Ali s men were patrolling the streets in bands of 10 and 15 omtbe lookout for casual Persians. I therefore sent Haji Abbas back again at once to the Chief with this news and a message that if any further harm was done, he^ himself could not possibly be absolved from blame. I repeated a suggestion that I had made that Sheikh Ali should be ordered to reside in Moharrag, during the month of Bamzan, and that the Chief should send over some of his own immediate followers from Moharrag to police the Man amah Bazaar streets. The Cmet sent me back word that he would see that no further trouble occurred, and also that he had after all decided to hold the enquiry himself. He did not, however, follow the advice I had given him as mentioned above. 9. Yesterday, Wednesday, the Persians’ shops remained closed and Sheikh Ali’s men continued behaving as before. To-day news has been brought to me that Sheikh Isa has sent a message to Haji Abdul Nabi that as be appeal 6 to me for help he need expect no consideration from himself. The Persian sufferers have all been told that they must attend the Shara Court, and e Persian community in general are to be fined Bs. 5,000 for keeping t eir shops closed. 10. In these circumstances I have not considered it desirable to postpone my report to you until the advent of the next up mail steamer, which is ue in three or four days, but I am sending this letter by a buggalow, specia y provided by the Persian community.11 • n. The man responsible for this outbreak, I am convinced, is Sheikh Ali Jjin Ahmed. You are aware that his tather until his death unofficially shared, with Sheikh Isa in the Government of the Islands. He lived in the large house on the sea shore in Manamah city which is still recognized as “ Govern- nient House ” and occupies the whole of one side of the open square in which j galuting Gun lies, and close to the Customs office and general landing f' stase. This^house is now the property of Sheikh Ali who took great offence at k Sheikh Isa’s appointing his son Sheikh Hamad to succeed to his father’s posi tion instead of himself. To console himself for the slight which he considered put upon him, Sheikh Ali has formed around his person a bodyguard of big men mostly Negros who are a terror to all quietly disposed residents in the Bazaar and whom I believe no man in the Chief’s entourage dares touch. Nearly all the men who are implicated in the Bahnson affair have now also taken part in this more recent case. It may be that Sheikh Isa is unwilling to see the family dignity injured through the punishment even of a nephew who is disloyal to himself, but I firmly believe now that my predecessor Hr Gaskin’s view is also correct that the Chief dare not attempt to exercise authority over Sheikh Ali. The fact that Sheikh Ali is disloyal at any rate in thought to his uncle is proved by his saying to me, when he called at the Agency to welcome my arrival, that if he had the share in the Government which his father had held he would be happy to use his influence towards the proper reformation of the Customs Administration. 12. I now have to make the following recommendations. In the absence of a British gunboat it is certain that no punitive measures will be submitted to by Sheikh Ali and his gang, either in the Wonckhaus case or the present one. I hope that as quickly as possible a gunboat may be sent here, and, if possible, allowed to remain here during the month of Ramzan, as I am not too confident that even the Hindu community will be safe much longer. 13 I think that on the arrival of the man-of-war, Sheikh Ali should be summond on board with all his male servants. Mr. Bahnson might be invited on board and asked to identify the men who were concerned m the assault on himself. All such, who may be known to have taken part also m the later affair, should be soundly flogged on board, then sent to Moharrag for one year’s imprisonment, and then expelled from the Islands m the event of security for good behaviours not being forthcoming. I think such action on our part as this is justified,by the Chief’s weakness and actively wrongful attitude. 11. Sheikh Ali should be banished from Bahrein, and preferably made to reside at Aden, for at least ten years. His brothers can administer his properties and remit him the proceeds. The old “ Government House should however be made over at a valuation to the Chief for the use of his son Sheikh Hamad. 15. Einally, Sheikh Isa, I think, should be told emphatically that no disputes between Shiahs and Sunnis are henceforth to be referred to the Shara Court, any more than disputes between Hindus and Mahommedans are. e iia is, who are mostly Persians, in the absence of the Shah’s Consular representatives naturally look to us for protection, and as the British Government are interested in the welfare of all classes in Bahrein, they cannot view with equanimity the injustice even of making Bahrein Shiahs (who are all Persian by origin) su mi to the jurisdiction of a religious Court other than their own. All such cases should be adjudicated upon by the Chief himself or by an impartial Mejlis. Dated 15th November 1904. From Dr. S. J.

Enclosure No. 5. No. 272, dated 19th November 1904. From — Captain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my letter No. 270, dated the 17th instant, I have the honour to report that the Persian shops are still closed in the Manamah Bazaar, and the Persians who have been summoned to the Shara Court, have refused, to appear there. They state that it was Sheikh Jassim himself, the leading Mullah in the Islands, who sent the worshippers out of his mosque to jomm the affray, and that if they appear before him, as they have been ordered to do, it is a foregone conclusion that they will be found guilty of having commence the disturbance and will be sentenced to punishments of flogging or imprison ment. 2. I believe it is a fact that Sheikh Jassim is a friend of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, and that he is not very loyal to the Chief of Bahrein. The latter on y sends cases to him for settlement when he is anxious to wash his own ban s of all connection with them. 3. Sheikh Isa is aware of the despatch of my last letter to you by Buggalow and he has now concurred in my suggestion that the settlement should s an over until the receipt of your orders. At the same time Sheikh Ali’s follower are still parading the streets in force, and I do not consider the situation i revert to normal until the arrival of a man-of-war here. I omitted w ; last letter to say that Sheikh Ali did not fulfil his promise to me about sen mg the five ringleaders over to Moharrag and he has recently sent me word tha broke this promise because Sheikh Jassim, the Mullah, had ordered him no carry out my request. This excuse I do not accept as satisfactory.13 4 . With regard to the suggestions for punishment that I made in my last , ,l 'iwish to observe that I do not believe there will be any difficulty about e ttin£ Sheikh Isa to acquiesce in them. There are more than one precedent ? the records of your office to show that orders for the banishment of indivi duals or the infliction of fines have been submitted to without protest or delay. IVToreover, the Chief is so weak and afraid of a portion of his subjects that he . i a( j to be able to tell them that his actions are prompted by jorce majeure. I am aware that in regard to the Customs question the Government of India do not wish to gain their ends directly by compulsion, but in the present cases, if our authority is not unhesitatingly vindicated, our prestige will be lowered not only here, hut probably in the entire length of the Arab Coast. In these circumstances I earnestly hope that you will be able to see your way to author- ‘zin 0, the adoption of strong measures as quickly as possible. Enclosure No. 6 . Statements of Persian Subjects. Deposition. No. 1. E.al {i-e. Karbelai) Ahwaz states on solemn affirmation :—I was in my shop in the afternoon in question, and, having heard from my son Abdu Nabi that my servants were being beaten, I closed my shop and went towards my house but was overtaken and assaulted. I was knocked down in the street by a crowd of Arabs. They hit me on the head, body, and arms, and I fell insen sible, and when I came to I found myself in my house. ]$ 0 t e% This witness, a very old man, aged about 80, was brought in on a litter He was in a very critical state and not in a fit condition to be cross- examined or give further evidence. I therefore sent him away, fearing that the ordeal might kill him. No. 2. Haii Abdul Nabi bin Kat Ahwaz, son of last witness (No, 1), on solemn affirmation:—I am a business man. My chief work is as Hamal lias hi for the Sheikh of Bahrein. I am also in the employment of Gray Paul &amp; Go. in con nection with the lighter service. I am also Dubash for the British Navy in Bahrein. My age is about 35. I was in the Customs Warehouse (Amara) in the afternoon about (10 Arabic) = (4 p.m. English). Two of my nephews, Ali and Rahkhuda, came and told methatmy emp oy and weighing man, Ramzan, had been killed in the bazaar by bein^ ea en o death by Arabs. . I thereupon ran to the bazaar and found a crowd of people mobbing Ram zan, who was under their feet, I called out and asked them ^w y iey beating my servant. They then caught me by the collar and said, Let us take him to Ali bin Ahmed (the Sheikh’s nephew). They then togS ed .. m 0 p a J®'! yards out of the bazaar, when we met Mansoor bin Khairullah, acting Bazaar Master, who rescued me from their hands. ^ j ^ v I then went unmolested to my father’s shop and found it closed smd my father just on the wav to his house. I joined him. On e Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s negro Bakheit el Nubi, who pretended to , and to make little of what had happened and joined us ^ im . self * 1 my house is a mosque called Musjid-i-Juma. As we approached it, I noticea a large gathering of Arabs armed with sticks, daggers, and swor s s an g the road. Bakheit held up his hands in a deprecatory way, ostensibly as f say to them “ Let them alone, ” and called out, “ Balakum Ba a u , “ Take care, take care. ” . , I think, however, that it must really have been a P r ® arran ” e they immediately made an assault upon us. They hit me on 7 arms upraised for self-protection, as I tried to escape. They caug i 7 cloak, which came away from my shoulders, and I escaped to e bin Kazim-Bushiri. ?There was no male in the house, and I went to the women’s quarter. Two men from the mob followed me with drawn swords. I do not know their names, but I can recognise them. They beat me with the flat of their swords and said “ Let us take him to Ali bin Ahmed.” I said, “ All right, I will go.” I came as far as the threshold. Then I thought to myself that they might kill me and ran back into the house among the women. The same two men followed me and were trying to drag me out when the women began to scream and a man entered [Mahomed bin Surhan (Arab), their next door neighbour, a servant of Ali bin Ahmed] and took the two assailants out and left me in the house and the door was closed. One of the two assailants was an Abyssinian slave of Ali bin dhmed and the other is his servant (i.e., All’s servant). I remained there till three hours after sunset, when Dr. Thoms and Mr. Lobo at the Consul’s request came to see after me. They informed me that my father and brother had been very severely wounded. The only reason I can think for this occurrence and the assault upon my employe is that it is I as Hamal Bashi, who have had to detect and demand the punishment of persons who rob from the lighters and the Customs House. They have not threatened me openly, but their object is to dome harm with the Sheikh and get me out. I have little or nothing to do with Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed personally. After the affray, during the night, Sheikh Isa’s negro came to me from his master. He asked me to overlook what had happened and assured me from the Sheikh that the culprits would be adequately punished. I showed the messenger the critical state of my father and brother, and he was very much shocked and went away to report. In the morning I went with Captain Prideaux to the Sheikh to Moharrag. I took the wounded men in a separate boat. I saw the Sheikh in Captain Pri- deaux’s presence. The Sheikh suggested that we should go to the Shariat. I demurred against going to the Shariat on the grounds his nephew Ali bin Ahmed in conjunction with the Mullahs Sheikh Jassim and Sheikh Ahmed bin Mahzar had ordered the assassination of the Persians and put up the assault on us and these same Mullahs are the “ Shariat, ” My reason for saying this was that Mullah Sheikh Ahmed and Sheikh Beraini, his brother, were standing among the moboutude the mosque looking on, and even the women came out with sticks or pestles and Sheikh All’s servants were mixed up in it as well. I never agreed to go to the Shariat for a moment. Bin Jilal, the Sheikh’s servant, did come to me the third day after the occurrence and wanted to take me to Sheikh Jassim, but I refused and informed Captain Prideaux that I had done so. There is no Mullah here whose decision or arbitration we as Shias could possibly accept in this vital case. Evidence taken in the presence of the Sheikh’s Vazier Shereideh, who has no further questions to put. Witness recalled 6 th December 1904:—It is quite true I have a revolver. I got it about three months ago from a man in Moharrag The reason was this. I ran down some robbers three months ago—Arabs from Bussorah—who had been committing several robberies, 8 were imprisoned, 3 are still (in prison ?) and 5 were released and expelled. Being in fear of my life on this account, 1 bought a revolver in Moharrag and got a country-man of mine, named Ali Mahomed, always to walk about with me and to sleep in my house Ali is a poor man, working hard for his living and lodging next door, so I selected him m order to give him a job. My sight is too bad for me to use a revolver myself, and, moreover, I know nothing about fire-arms or the use of them. I cannot recognise anybody at more than 3 or 4 yards, and in the daytime I always wear g asses. My eyes were operated on in Bushire a short time ago, but I have derived no benefit from it.

My sight is very bad (note one eye is evidently quiteblmd andthe lefthalf blind), and I ran up against a man by mistake who was standing in the street. He abused me, and when I asked him why he aid so, he assaulted me severely with his fists. I could not recognise him then and do not now know who he is.

The Arab turned round and caught hold of Ramzan and abused mm. Ramzan said he did not mean to do it, and that the street was narrow.

There were a great lot of them, Aiabsand Sidis. When I went up, they hit me on the head and arms. I received about six blows; after that I became insensible. I remember four persons striking me. The names of the two are :— (1) Marzuk bin Zaid, a loafer Sidi boy. (2) Saad bin (?) an Arab, also a loafer. I could recognise the other two, one is Marzuk’s brother, the other a rela tion of Marzuk. I believe I was carried on a donkey to my house by one Sadiq, but have no recollection. I was insensible for two days and was attended by the mission doctor. I am not able to work yet and my hand and body still give me much pain. I was beaten to insensibility before Sadiq and Abbas were beaten, and do not know who beat them. No. 8.

I was about to close the shop for the day (one of Haji Ahwaz’s five shops), when I heard that Ramzan was being killed. I ran for the spot, but when I got as far as Abdu Reza Dowani’s shop, I was assaulted by three persons from la crowd. They hit me over the head with sticks, and I fled towards Kal Ahwaz’s house; but before going there, I lay low on the seashore till all was quiet. The men who struck me were negros.

We were working at the Residency at the time. -I went first to my house to get a saucer for ghee and then went to the bazaar. At the entrance to the bazaar I was suddenly attacked. There was a crowd of over 100 of Arabs and Sidis. There were even women there who joined in. I received a shower of blows from the mob. I recognise two of my assailants: — (1) Is, well known as Bukheit el Nubi, (2) Marzuk, a negro, both belong to Ali bin Ahmed. When they prepared to strike me, I said, What’s up ?” They replied,** Ask your father.” A common insulting form of reply. They knocked me down and I became insensible.

I had hardly reached the spot (at entrance to the bazaar) I got a blow from a Mashab (knob kerry with a lumn of pitch at the end used for fighting) in the face on the left cheek bone. I‘still suffer much pain and cannot masticate. There were many people present, but I was only beaten by one, an Arab. J I do not know his name and could not recognise him if I saw him. I fell down when I was hit. I had Rs. 8 in my pocket, which were spilt. I picked myself np and ran for my life. I came from Bushire less than a month ago, and do not know Arabic and did not understand what the mob said. I was so frightened that I did not close my shop.

Abdu Nabi’s servant had a revolver in his hand. I don’t know his name. I could identify him if I saw him. He did not fire the revolver. I then went to my house. I had no curiosity to see any more and wished to get away, and ran as quickly as I could. I know no more. There were 100 or 200 men, I should say. I did not count them.

On that day I was in my shop selling groceries My shop is outside the bazaar. The disturbance was far from my shop. I could not see it from my shop. A number of Persians passed my shop going towards the bazaar. I don’t know who any of them were. They were like masons. They went silently altogether. No one that I recognised was wi h hem. Afterwards they came back about 10 minutes later, and Arabs were with hem. The Arabs were frightened and running away and Persians following t em. There were not more than 50 persons or slightly under. When I saw them, t.e., the Persians, they were beating the Arabs. I saw no Arab Wled, or any wounded. I did not see any Persian killed, but I saw Abdu Nabi s father aud brother lying on the ground and the Arabs beating them. After I saw the Persian masons coming back as above stated, I closed my shop. I closed early owing to the disturbance, as I thought there was no more chance of business. When I shut up, I went towards my house. I saw people beating Mahomed KalReza and his father. I did not help them. I am too poor a person. I made off to my house. Arabs were actually heating them. 1 canno recognise any of them. There was a crowd of about 80 or 100 persons, slaves, Arabs, homeborn negros, and some women. There were only two Persians, Mahomed and his father. Ahdu Nabi was running away. Some Arabs were following him to heat him. They reached him, hut he escaped by his good luck. He escaped to Ah bin Kazim’s house. I saw him go in there with people after him, but I did not see other people enter the house. The people inside closed the door. 1 then went home and did not come out again. I don’t know what was tno beginning of the row. I stated something in an ishtishad (testimony P a P er ) about this. I gave it in the house of Mullah Sheikh Ahmed, brother of Mullah Sheikh Jassim. Mansur bin Khair Allah took me there. The Mullah asked me to say what I had seen. I told him I had seen the Persians running after the Arabs. Salman Megu wrote it. He is a shopkeeper. I did not tell them all I have told you. They did not ask me so much ; they only took down a few words from me and then allowed me to go. Cross-examined hy Sheikh Hamed :— Some of the Persian masons had canes and some thick sticks—I don t know what for. I don’t know how many Arabs and how many Persians there were, hut there were about 50 altogether. The Arabs were carrying nothing in their hands. I saw a revolver in the hands of one of the servants of Abdu Nabi. He did not fire it, and I don’t know what he wanted it for. ijWhen the masons passed back from bazaar, I saw Kahtani’s son go among them and they beat um. I did not see any other Arabs beaten except Walad Kahtam. He fell down and got up and bolted and hid himself in the shop of Mubarak el Gameis. After that they left him alone and the Persians dispersed. No. 14 A. Abdulla bin Saad, Arab, aged 40, on solemn affirmation states — I keep a piece-goods shop in the “Sook el Maghasis.” I remember the disturbance at the beginmng of this month. I said my “asr” prayers that day at the mosque of Mahomed bin Ahmed. After that I returned to mv shop and stayed there until the disturbance began. The first that I saw was that Abdu Nabi passed my shop with many Persians. I only know one who had a revolver. I can’t say why I noticed him, only I closed my shop and went away. Nobody told me the word “Rewavwar,” although I usually know the weapon as “ fard.” Abdu Nabi had a stick in his hand and so had the others They passed me and I saw no more. I was subsequently sent for by Sheikh Ahmed with the other people I don’t know what day, but about 10 days ago. They asked me what I knew and I said I saw Abdu Nabi in the bazaar in front of his servants saying to them “ Buzan, Buzan, el Ealoosfel bet.” Re said these exact ivords. (The others have quoted him differently and it is to be noted that cf Bezan ” is Persian and the rest Arabic.) No. 15. Abdul Aziz bin Salim, Negroid, aged about 40, states on solemn affirm ation:—’! am a diver in the service of Abdulla bin Hassan Doseri. I live in Bahrein in a house of my own. I have been here the whole of Ramzan. A disturbance occurred about 5th. I was here at the time. In the afternoon I said my “asr ” prayers in the mosque called “Jumaan” and afterwards went to the Persian bazaar and sat outside a Halwa shop. I had no business there particularly. I sat talking to a friend, Ahmed bin Haji Abdulla. I sat there about 3 hours or 3^ hours. The name of the owner of the shop was Haji Abdulla and Ahmed, his son abovementioned. No one else was sitting there. While there I sa w Abdu NabPs weighing boy standing near the Halwa shop. He was doing nothing particular. Another boy an Arab passed him and ran against him. The servant of Abdu Nahi caught hold of the Arab boy by the neck. The Arab boy had his brother with him and they both closed with the Persian. This was quite close to me. I went up and interfered and stopped them. They none of them had sticks, but small canes, which they used, but did not hurt one another. After I separated them, they went away. After 15 minutes later Abdu Nabi came himself from the Amara. He abused the two Arabs who had quarrelled with his servant. I do not know the Arabs* names. I should recognise them if I saw them. The Arabs did not return the abuse. Abdu Nabi then went to the Amara at least I suppose so as he brought back workmen with him. He was away about J hour. When he came back, he was with his workmen walking in front of them. He had nothing in his hands, but ordered his men to “ Bezan ” strike. He meant to strike four or five Arabs who were sitting there, including the two hoys who had quarrelled with his servant. They did not kill any Arab in my presence, nor did I see any wounded or hurt. They then left the bazaar. I returned to my house. I saw no more of the disturbance, nor did I see any one wounded, but I heard there was a row in the street, but was not curious enough to go and see it. I was subsequently called by Mansoor bin Kheir Allah (last^ Friday, December 2ad) to Sheikh Ahmed’s house afternoon prayers. Vazier She- reideh was present, and others whom they had collected for testimony. Mullah Sheikh Ahmed bin Mahzar took my statement. Salman Megu wrote it. They asked me what had happened. I told them as above. They wrote it down. I gave my verbal evidence to Sheikh Ahmed once before, but he did not writeit down. He sent for me. He practically governs in Manama. In any matter of occurrence in the bazaar feheikh Jassim and Sheikh Ahmed (the two Mullahs) settle them. I haven’t the least idea who the two Arab hoys were. Cross-examined by Sheikh Ahmed :— There was no revolver in Abdu Nabi’s hand. His people struck the Arabs when he said “ Hezan, Bezan,” Arabs then left the bazaar. I cannot say how many Persians there were. Ko. 16. Musa bin Yusuf, Arab, of Hassa, aged 50, states on solemn affirmation I am a broker, selling dothes. I have a shop. I remember the disturb ance at the beginning of Ramzan. X was in my shop that afternoon and having closed my shop was about to go to my house. While goin» there I found Abdu Nabi with some Persians near the Persian shops. I saw about 9 men. Abdu Nabi had nothing in his hand. His servant Aliyan had a revolver in his hand, and others had sticks. I can see well (his eyes look as if he could not see, being very opaque). Ali was holding up the revolver. He did not fire it. He and the men with him were running. Abdu Nabi was ahead and calling out “Bezan, Bezan,” referring to the Arabs, about 8 or 9 who were there. I saw the Persian strike a negro domestic named Saad bin Ferhan bu Khairallah. Dm Abdu Nabi called out, “ Kill him : his blood money is in my box.” I passed on and went home. They hit him with sticks, but did not hurt him severelv 3 or 4 blows. * * I saw no more until I got home. I was only called to Sheikh Ahmed’s house last Friday (December 2nd). I gave the same statement as I have given now. 5 No. 17. Hassan Mohammed, Arab, aged 30, states on solemn affirmation 1 am a grocer. I remember the disturbance at the beginning of Ramzan. I was sitting in my shop in the evening. Ali, the servant of Abdu Nabi passed my shop He was accompanied by 5 or 6 Bushiris, labourers ; he was at their head and had a _ revolver in his hands, the others had sticks. They were hurrying along. Ali did not fire his revolver before me. In front of mv shop they struck a boy named Queran bin Saad an Arab. I don’t know why they struck him. J They gave him one or two blows and be bolted. After I saw this I closed my shop and went to my house, fearing some disturbance. I was sent for to Sheikh Ahmed’s house last Friday (2nd December).

There was no one at the Musjid. The row had stopped and the wounded men had been removed to their houses. I then went home. I did not see any one wounded then, but next day I saw Abdu Rahim Kal Awaz’s servant and he was wounded, and also another man related to Husseinu, whose name I do not know. I did not see the beginning of the row. I know no more. I did not see what was in the hands of Abdu Nabi’s masons. I went to Sheikh Ahmed's last Friday with the others. No further cross-examination. No. 19. Hussein Mahomed, Arab, aged 25 : states on solemn affirmation: I remember the occasion of the disturbance ; it was 5 or 6 days from the beginning of Ramzan. I am a batcher and have a shop in the meat bazaar. I went to° the Halwa shops, but had not bought anything. I saw a crowd quarrelling near the shop of Muallim. There were 7 or 8 persons, When I iust saw them, each man had his string of beads in his hands. They were saying prayers over them and saying, “ Subhan Allah, Subhan Allah. ’ They then be^an to quarrel. I looked on. I saw a servant of Abdu Nabi’s, a boy with a blind eye, standing there. Another boy, an Arab, passed him and gave a pull at his coat. Abdu Nabi’s servant turned round and hit the other boy with his fist in the neck. They thereupon closed upon one another. Upon this the servants of Kal Awaz (father of Abdu Nabi) came out. The servant Ghulum (of Abdu Nabi) tried to stop the two boys, but the other servant hit the Arab boy, who had pulled the blind youth’s coat with a stick. The Arab youth fell down. They were separated by other Arabs who had by now collected. At this time Abdn Nabi was standing near Muallim s shop. Abdn Nabi had a mason with him, whose name I do not know, a Persian. Abdu Nabi cried out “ Bezan” to the blind boy and to the mason. They went on ahead of Abdu Nabi, calling out “ Bezan, Bezan strike, strike; and anyone they met they beat. They had in their hands thick canes from Bombay. The blind boy, when he first quarrelled with the Arab hoy, had a thin stick in his hand, but afterwards used bigger sticks which they fetched from the house of Abdu Nabi, about 400 yards away. I now say I don’t know whether Abdu Nabi was Jl ous ® ° r ., in n tb ® Amara or elsewhere. After the two boys were separated, 0 r ^' eyed boy went away and came back with Abdu Nabi and about 15 laho (masons). They all had sticks. They began to beat Arabs and anybody they saw in the bazaar. I went to my house. I got accidentally ^^d by stick on the way, but whether it was the stick of a Persian or an Arab I c not say. I made myself scarce when the beating began. y or 20 Persians I cannot say at all how many people there we g » whether there were 20 or 1,000 or how many.

I stayed there an hour. All was quiet there, I did not see any row, hut while sitting there saw some Persians, about 5, 6, or 7, pass by. They passed by m e ordinary way. They were not shouting or talking. They went on to t e bazaar. I do not know any of. them, but one of them carried a revolver, an I should know him if I saw him. Although they went by quietly, I particu larly noticed the revolver. I followed them about 20 yards into the halwa bazaar. There they began to beat Arabs. The bazaar was filled with a grea number of people, Arabs. I did not see them kill any Arabs. I sa ^ w0 men struck, one on the head, and one on the shoulder, but I did not see t iem again. I stood there quarter of an hour. I was not afraid of being drawn into the quarrel. Thanks to God’s chance, I was not hit myself.The row stopped of itself and the people left the bazaar.

Mahomed Sarhan, Arab, states on solemn affirmation:—I am in service of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed. I have been in his service five years. On the day that the disturbance took place I had been out hawking: On my return I saw a crowd of Arabs near the entrance of the bazaar. There were Arabs, Persians, and women and were hurrying backwards and forwards. I asked what was up. They said there was a quarrel between Persians and Arabs and that Abdu Nabi had told his servants to be at the Arabs. I took my bird to my house. Ali Kazim’s house is contiguous to mine. 1 sat down to wash myself. Meanwhile a woman from Ali bin Kazim’s house told him that men had rushed into their house. I went out and found a crowd at Ali bin Kazim’s door, Arabs, Bahreinis, Persians, and women. I asked them what they were doing and told them to go away. The place was full of people. Some went away, some remained. Hereupon the women told me Abdu Nabi was inside and told me to come in. I went in and found Abdu Nabi. He was alone, standing near the door. I asked him how he was and he said, “ As you see me.” I don’t know what he meant. I left and returned to my 'house. I don’t know why the women called me, but perhaps they did so on account of the mob at the house. I then returned to my house and said my prayers. Afterwards I made inquiries from people as to what had happened, and I was told that Persians and Arab youths had been fighting in the bazaar. When I saw Abdu Nabi, he was in his usual health and condition. He was not bleeding or perturbed. There were no other men in the house. I do not know why the women screamed and called to me for help. I now say that the mob outside were all Persians. No cross-examination. Note —Notwithstanding Sheikh Hamad’s refusal to call any one actually implicated, I persuaded Vazier Shereideh to bring this man on the grounds that he h id apparently partially assisted Abdu Nabi (No. 2), vide his statement. He evidently came, however, duly tutored and prepared to lie, and kept chang ing his statements constantly. His evidence cannot be depended on in the slightest. No. 22. Ali bin Mahomed, Persian of Hayir, states on solemn affirmation :—I am a labourer under the mason Mahmud working at the Agency hospital. I remember the occurrence at the beginning of the month, but did not hear of it till afterwards. I have never been a servant of Abdu Nabi, but about three months ago I was employed by him to accompany him when he walked abroad and to carry a revolver. This was done for 10 or 12 days. The reason was that Abdu Nabi had run down some robbers, Arabs of Bussorah ; 3 of ^ them are still in prison, 5 others were expelled after a month. He, Abdu Nabi, went in fear of his life and asked me to stand by him day and night for a few days. Abdu Nabi supplied the revolver and took it back after the 10 days wereI know nothing about the disturbance except what I heard afterwards by hearsay. No. 32. , r . „„ a went of Messrs.

About 10 or 15 minutes before sunset Mr. Milborrow (my chief) came downstairs and asked me to come for a walk and I left Hassan bin Ahmed there with several others who were waiting to see the sun go down in order to set them watches and then go to pray. I did not see bim again then. Afterwards I met him, after having heard that he had given evidence of an eye witness before you, and said to him “ You who profess to read the Koran, how could you go and pretend to give evidence about the disturbance when you know you were with me at the time or at my place right up to sunset./ He replied, “ I went there after I left you.” I rejoined, “ But by that time it was sunset and all the shops would have been closed.”^ He then changed his statement and said, “ No, I went before I came to you.” This was obviously false as the disturbance was not known to any of us when he was with me. I did not hear of it until I went out. My tindal, Ghulam Ali, one of the clerks Abu Talib, could corroborate my statement T?pfnrp me. (Sd.) P. Z. COX. The 9th December 1904.

I should not anticipate any immediate result from that denouement, but the Turks would doubtless foster an anti-foreign shibboleth to our detriment and would employ Bin Saud to seduce Mubarak from us. As long as we maintain the present arrangement I do not think we have much to fear; but if simultaneously with rapproche ment, we get away or partially withdraw palpable support from Koweit, then the ultimate probability must be the secession of Mubarak.

With reference to the written agreement which was given you by Sheikh Esa bin Ali, Chief of Bahrein, on the subject of the expulsion of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed for three weeks from Bahrein, I have the honour to report that Sheikh Ali left for A1 Katr on the morning of Saturday, the 17th instant, i.e., within the period stipulated for by you. 2. The last act of this Sheikh was one of open bravado, as he sent his servants out to the down-going mail steamer Kangra and took away by force the three large baggalas which had been supplied by Haji Abdul Nabi for the reception of the Kangrds cargo, his servants, I am informed, actually cutting* all the ropes which connected the buggalas with the ship. 3. The people here speak of this act as one of Suhhra. It has caused considerable loss and inconvenience to the British India Steam Navigation Company, as the Commander of the Kangra had hoped to discharge all the Bahrein cargo which he had been compelled to overcarry on the up-journey owing to rough weather. He arrived here a day late and the Bazaar Master took some six hours in providing other boats. The result was that the Kangra left here on Saturday morning with some 73 packages of cargo overcarried, some of which included all the wood work required for the Charitable Dispensary and with a very fair possibility of missing connection with the fast maiNsteamer at Maskat.No. 33-E.B., dated Fort Wiliiam, the 4th January 1905.

Please refer to your telegram No. 85, dated the 6th January 1905. I think that the arrangement proposed for the 2nd February will meet the case on the supposition that Captain Prideaux is provided by that time with his sepoy guard which I can temporarily augment from here if necessary. The Sheikh has now had time to consider his position deliberately, and when he sees that we are prepared to force compliance with our demands he will in all probability comply, but in any case it will be prudent to retain one ship there for some little time after the incident is closed. I do not favour any preliminary threat regarding the seizure of the Customs, but recommend that if our present demands are not complied with by the Sheikh forthwith, he should be threatened with immediate bombardment of Mroharrag, and that a strong detatchment of seamen should, if that contingency arises, be sent ashore to Manama in order to protect the European community during bombardment and simultaneously to seize the Customs house, which latter would only be handed back with a British official in charge. I think that the Sheikh might, in any case when our present demands have been exacted, be plainly warned that any further rejection of their advice in important matters will not be tolerated by the Government of India. If such a warning is given it ni a y have the effect of causing the Sheikh to accept the advice of the Political Agent regarding the Customs when next preferred after a convenient interval of time. Please inform me whether a decision regarding the general question of jurisdiction over the subjects of the Shah in Bahram has been arrived at by Government. r* / i With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 4062-E. B., dated ith December 1904, conveying sanction to the additional expenditure of Rs. 347-11-0 incurred iu connection with house accom modation for the Political Agent atKoiveit, I have the honour to forward a copy No. 105, dated 7th December 1904 , with of the marginally noted letter from enct seres. ^ Captain Knox applying for a further grant of 11 s. 2,184 for providing accommodation for private servants and for one European guest. 2. ihe plans and estimates which accompany Captain Knox’s letter show the nature of alterations and additions which he is anxious to make to the house at present occupied by him, and I agree with him in thinking that the expenditure on the proposed buildings will not be wasted but will provide for undoubted requirements in the future. Of course this expenditure will not be recoverable, as that of its. 1,347-11-0 is under the lease with Jasim bin Asfoor, but I trust that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction the cost of the proposed additions as a special grant; and also the rent of Rs. 12 per mensem for the two plots of ground belonging to the widow of one Mubarek bin Zaid mentioned in Captain Knox’s letter. No. 105, dated the 7th December 1904. From— Captain S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. C ox, C.I.E., Ofg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward, herewith, two copies of a letter No. 25, dated the 4th December 1904, from the Assistant Engineer on deputation, to my address, in which lie has, at my request, furnished, in duplicate, estimates and plans for alterations and additions to the house of Jasim-ul-Asfoor at present occupied by me, on the conditions noted in my letter No. 7, dated the 17th August 1904, to your address. 2. These alterations provide for a small suite of rooms on the first floor which would enable me to accommodate another European and a set of five servants’ quarters. 3. The plans are very clear and comprehensive and drawn to scale. The dividing wall between the cook-room and stables shows the boundary between the estate of J asim-ul-Asfoor and a plot of land whose owner is the widow of one Mobarek bin Zaid. 4. My letter No. 7, dated the 17th August 1904, quoted above, shows the conditions on which Jasim-ul-Asfoor’s estate is occupied by me. 5. As regards the remaining plot of land, I have as a private arrangement rented the portion enclosed between the two walls, one between the cook-room and stables, and the other which is shown on the plan as to be demolished, at a monthly rent of its. 4. A translation of the lease is enclosed. 6. For the remaining portion which it is proposed to enclose for the three remaining servants’ houses, Mobarek’s widow has so far demanded the exces sive monthly rent of Rs. 8. The wall to be demolished and the wall at back of the proposed new servants’ houses are all that remain standing of some very tumble-down buildings. The land is not otherwise enclosed and has been used hitherto as a dung-heap. 7. I would ask that I may be authorised to enter into a lease on behalf of Government for all the land shown on the plan as the property of Mobarek’s widow at a monthly rent not exceeding Rs. 12. I shall endeavour to obtain cheaper terms if possible. 8. It will probably not be difficult later on to convert both leases, that with Jasim-ul-Asfoor and that with Mobarek’s widow, into deeds of pu: chase if such a course is considered advisable.9 The immediate object of these alterations and additions is to provide suitable accommodation for native servants and set free the present servants’ room for godown accommodation and also to enable the lohtical Agent to pat nn one euest at least. These wants have been felt severely recently owing to the visit of Mr. Gaskin of the Gazetteer staff and Mr. Beveridge of the Public Works Department for both of whom I was compelled to beg accommodation from the Sheikh. 10 It' is hoped that the proposed improvements will suffice for the needs of Koweit until a suitable Agency can be constructed, the plans for which Mr. Beveridge has been engaged in preparing during the past fortnight under my supervision. 11. In those proposals no provision has been made for dispensary or Post Office, because the site for the new Agency is H miles from the town and it was felt that the Post Office and the dispensary would be of greater utility to the general public if situated in the town of Koweit itself. 12. The ground floor of the buildings shown in the plan would provide ample accommodation for the needs of Koweit Post Office and dispensary for many years to come and the first floor could be used as quarters for the Assist ant Surgeon and Postmaster. 13. If it be objected that the quarters would be rather too good for a man in the position of a Postmaster, I would suggest that one suite might be fur nished with cheap, simple, and durable furniture of the dak bungalow type, and could be used with the permission of the Political Agent for the accommoda tion of visitors to Koweit who desire temporary accommodation in or near the town. 14. This is, I think, as far as it is possible to look ahead at present, but I trust that I have said sufficient to establish that the proposed buildings will supply an immediate want, and that the money spent by Government will not be wasted but will provide for almost certain requiremeuts in the future. 15. If sanction to the proposed buildings reach me by the end of February 1905, I hope to have the buildings completed before May begins, but I would ask that if my proposals are approved, intimation of the sanction may be sent at once and direct to the Superintending Engineer of the Indus Right Bank Division so that the doors, windows, etc., which must be obtained from Karachi may be despatched w ithout delay by the Public Works Department. Translation of lease of a plot of ground adjoining house and premises of Jasim bin Asfoor. In the name of God. The cause of writing is that there has been a hiring of the building of the small enclosure which is adjacent to the building of Jasim-ul-AsfodV belong ing to the wife of Mobarek bin Zaid to Captain Knox, Political Agent of the English Government, for a monthly rent of rupees four only. Captain Knox will pay it to the wife of Mobarek bin Zaid the aforesaid, and there is not on the proprietor of the aforesaid building the expense of building or any other. All the expenses of building, etc., will be on Captain Knox and the beginning of the hiring will be from the 1st of the month of Jamadi-ul-Akhir 1322 H.= 14th August 1904, and this lease will remain in force and this place will remain in the hands of Captain Knox as long as he pleases; as long as he wishes for this place, he will stay in it at this rent fixed, and when he does not wish to stay in this place and wishes to go out from it and if he sees fit that he should take from it what he has constructed in this place, of wood or chandals or doors, then he may take them. No one will stop him and on this was the promise or the agreement that it may not be hidden. (Sealed) SHEIKH MOBAREK-US-SUBAH. 1st Jamadi-ul-Akhie 1322.

S .rs the Persian Gulf /?&lt; , /■ .rn MixSir:- The Marquess of Lansdovvne has given careful con sideration to the telegram from the Viceroy of India November 19th regarding Koweit, enclosed in your letter of the same date. This telegram is an answer to a telegram from the Secretary of State for India of November 11th, in which it was stated that, in view of the general situation elsewhere, His Majesty*s Government considered it desirable that Major Knox should be temporarily with- ihe Under Secretary of State, India Office. drawn from Koweit, in order not to raise a difficult question with the Turkish Government at the present mo ment; the Government of India were accordingly request ed by Mr. Brodrick to consider the question with a view to fixing the earliest possible date for his withdrawal. When the Viceroy’s telegram of November 19th was des-despatched the Sovemment of India had not receivea Mr. Brodrick's communication of November 11th which gives a detailed explanation of the policy of His Maj esty's Government and it is possible tnat, had this in formation been before them, the view taken by the 0 Viceroy mignt; have been sornev/b&amp;t/ modified* But in any case Lord Lansdowne cannot think that the view taken by the Government of India is altogether wellfounded. It appears indeed to be based upon a complete misapprehension of the circumstances in which His Majesty’s Government gave their sanction to the deputation of Major Knox to visit Koweit as an Agent of the British Government. His Majesty's Government have never agreed to the appointment of a British Officer to reside permanently at Koweit. This course, which was sug gested for consideration by Sir N. O'Conor in his tele gram 112 of July 18th, 1903, and supported by the Government of India in their telegram of July 31st, was discussed at length by the two Departments in the correspondence noted in the margin. Copies of these lettersletters were no doubt forwarded to India in the ordi nary course, and the decision of His Majesty's Govern ment is clearly and sufficiently summarized in the following telegram, dated August 26th from the Secre tary of State to the Government of India:- 'On the whole His Majesty's Government consider that the proposal to appoint a British Officer to re side permanently at Koweit could not but be regarded as a departure, only to be justified by clear necessity, from the Status quo which they have insisted upon so strongly in their discussions with the Turkish Govern ment. Proposal to take Consul at Mohammerah away from his commercial duties in Persia in order to deal with questions of an entirely different class connected with Turkish Arabia is also one to which Foreign Office object. It is considered that the existing system under which the ordinary channel of communication with Koweit is the Resident in the Persian Gulf, or one of his subordinates, works well on the whole. Closer touch with Koweit could, if found necessary hereafter,be gradually established by repeating at intervals temporary visits of selected Officer until his resi dence becomes practically permanent”. It would obviously not be consistent with the policy thus expressed to make an immediate and permanent appointment of a British Agent to reside at Koweit, nor would it be possible to reconcile such an appointment with the assurances given to Turkey regarding the main tenance of the Status quo in the Persian Gulf; on the other hand the deputation of an Officer to visit Koweit from time to time as a temporary measure has received tne full approval of His Majesty’s Government, and it was always intended that in any communications which mignt take place with the Turkish Government the right to take this step as often as it may seem desirable to do so should be absolutely reserved. When tr;ereror e the Government of India suggested, in their telegram of May 20th, 1904, that the moment was opportune for the despatch of an Officer to Koweit His Majesty's Government gave their sanction to the pro posal, hut they certainly did not intend that there shouldshould be any departure from the conditions upon which they had originally insisted. Lord Lansdowne has, as Mr. Secretary Brodi*ick is aware, every desire to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Government of India. The permanent retention of the Agent would however involve so serious a departure from the general line of policy laid down by His Majesty’s Government that His Lordship is as at present advised unable to agree to it. He is however prepared to agree that no immediate steps should be taken for Major Knox's withdrawal, and having regard to the recent conduct of the Turkish Government in respect to the Aden Irade, and the occu pation of the island of Bubian by Turkish troops, it seems to him that there is some advantage in allowing Major Knox to remain for the present at Koweit. He should however, in Lord Lansdowne’s opinion, certainly be withdrawn after a reasonable interval, and he might be instructed to Inform the Sheikh before his departure that he will repeat his visits and that the date of his return will depend on the course of events. HeHe might be authorized to add that if, during his ab sence, events should occur or communications be made to the Sheikh tending to affect the Sheikn s position in regard to Turkey or any foreign Power, a message should be addressed by the Sheikh to the Political Agent in the Persian Gulf. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, Y- ftV, U [This Docnmgnt is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s THE Turkish Ambassador made to me to-day a statement to the following effect :— As the Turkish Government had already declared, the presence of a British Agent at Koweit could only be regarded as an infringement of the status quo. A simple examination of the question would convince me of this. I was doubtless as anxious as the Porte for the strict maintenance of the understanding arrived at by the two Governments on this subject, and the Imperial Government felt sure that a study of the documents would of itself be sufficient to enlighten me. His Excellency was therefore instructed to press for the prompt recall of our Agent. I told the Ambassador in reply that, in view of the attitude of the Turkish Government in regard to the Aden Irade, I was not prepared to discuss this question.

THE Turkish Ambassador told me to-day that he had repeated to the Turkish Government the observations which I had made to him upon the 20th ultimo with regard to the despatch of a British officer to Koweit. He was instructed to tell me that the sending of such an Agent to Koweit without the consent or knowledge of the Turkish Government, amounted, in their opinion, to an alteration of the status quo, no matter what title might be given to the Agent in question, or what might be the length of his sojourn in the country. His Excellency was desired to make a representation to this effect to me, and to endeavour to obtain the early recall of the Agent in question, and some assurance that such a disturbance of the status quo would not be repeated. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LANSDOWNE. [2239 6—1]From Viceroy, 19th November 1904. p # — Koweit. Tour telegram of the 11th instant. Communication made to the Turkish Government by His Majesty's Government, to the effect that appointment of Folitical Agent is not permanent, is complete surprise to me, having regard to circumstances in which revival of proposal in May 1903 was rendered necessary, and I view the action taken with the greatest regret. Sheikh already has doubts as to the value of our friendship, and result of withdrawing our Agent will be to alienate him completely, and probably also to make both Mubarak and his friend Ibn Saood yield to the overtures which Turks have been repeatedly making. This means not merely that Turkish dominion will be extended down the Gulf, but also that Koweit will be exposed to the advances of foreign Powers. Rumour that proposal has been made to Sheikh to receive French and Russian Agents at Koweit has already been reported to you by us. It is my firm conviction that our Agent, if withdrawn now, will never return to Koweit, as next time opposition of Germany, as well as that of Turkey, to resumption of present favourable position will have to be faced. In these circumstances I would strongly urge at any rate post ponement of withdrawal of Knox until such time as our position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and in relation to Mubarak, is sufficiently strong to admit of such a step being taken without involving the disastrous results which under present circumstances will inevitably ensue. ~ Fo- rq W 7 f ^^respondenFZththfTFeiL You will see j Of the nth instant that with a Z,?T wh fhwas enclosed in my Deep ford Lansdowne desiZs th J ZoiiLZFTI, ° f Somatic hffiJl ™«ted on the lines laid down in the n 'I ^ont at Koweit shouk f; JV.

My Lord:- I have the honour to report that in the course of a conversation to-day at the Sublime Porte, the Grand Vizier alluded to the presence of a British officer at Koweit, saying that such an appointment was in contradiction with the agreement arrived at to main tain the status quo in those regions. His Highness said that it was most undesirable that any steps should be taken which might be interpreted as an intention on the part of His Kajesty’s Government to encourage the Sheikh of Koweit, who had given the Turkish Government considerable trouble by his constant intrigues with men like Sadun Pasha and other turbulent elements. I replied that I had no authority to dis cuss the question at length, but that no doubt His Highness was in possession of a report of a recent con versation which Musurus Pasha had had with Your Lord- ship barquees of Lansdowne, K. G., , &amp;c.Lordship upon this subject, as conmunlcated to me in your despatch No. 365 of the 20th ultimo, and I did not think there was any need for me to say more. I would add, however, that His Highness must he well aware that the efforts of His Majesty’s Government had always been directed to restraining any inclination on the part of Sheikh Nubarrak to mix up in the quarrels which were perpetual in the interior. Ferid Pasha then repeated that anything which the Sheikh could interpret as a disposition on the part of the British Government to encourage him was to be deprecated, and he expressed the hope that His Majes ty’s Government would issue the necessary instructions that lajor Knox should leave Koweit, as the Porte could not but consider his presence there an infringement of the status quo. I here took occasion to remark that the continued maintenance of a military post on Bubian Island was looked upon by His Majesty’s Government in the same light, and I reminded His Highness and the I inlster for Foreign Affairs, who was present at the interview. that(Signed) Walter Townley. that tl^ie Note Verbale from the Etobassy protesting against its continuance still remained unanswered. Tewfik Pasha replied that he had explained to Sir Nicholas O’Conor that the military post had been es tablished on the island for the protection of the fishermen on the coast, and that Sheikh l ubarrak had never established any claim to the island, which was a barren, uninhabitable waste. I refused to discuss the question and contented myself with saying that His Majesty’s Government did not share the views of the Ottoman Government on this question, and that Sir N. O’Conor had certainly not taken His Excellency’s verbal statements as an answer to the Note.

P —Complaint has been made by Turkish Government to the effect that the appointment of Knox as Agent at Koweit is inconsistent with the main tenance of the status quo. Our reply is that deputation of Knox is temporary, and that Sis Majesty's Government have made no permanent appointment, but that they reserve to themselves the right at their uncon trolled discretion to send officer to Koweit in order to report upon state of affairs there, and to ensure that the modus vivendi which has been arrived at is maintained. In view of the difficulty with the Forte m the matter of the Aden delimitation, as well of the general political situation elsewhere. Lord Lansdowne is most anxious that the Koweit question should not at present be forced into prominence. I request, therefore, that you will con sider the question of temporarily withdrawing Knox from Koweit, with a view to the earliest possible date being fixed. Despatch in this sense has been sent to you by to-day's mail. GlMj ll hr*I have never seen the letter in vihioh the appointment at Koweit was authorised, and therefore I do not hnovj whether it was conditional or not. It would seem to me better to say that British interests demand that a British officer should be sent from time to time to Koweit^H.M. Govt, reserving full discretion as to time and length of stay ) and that Ifajor Knox is at Koweit under these conditions- than to describe his mission as specia l and temporary. For will not a series of special and temporary missions give more offence than a regular practice of visits from Bushire, just stopping short of permanence'? The man might for instance alioays be withdraim in the summer and might run up to Shiraz or elsewhere. Would it not be a good thing in any case to Keep Major Knox at Koweit until Boobiyan island is evacuated?[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s THE Turkish Ambassador asked me this evening whether it was true that the Government of India had lately appointed an officer as Political Agent at Koweit. The Turkish Government had been informed that Major Knox, Assistant in the Consulate at Bushire, had been selected for the post. This arrangement appeared to them to involve an unwarrantable disturbance of the status quo. I said that I believed it was the case that a British officer had been sent on a mission to Koweit, with instructions to stay there for a time and to collect information, but that he was not. going to take up his abode there permanently.

I agree in the view expressed bv Lord Lansdowne as to the in- expediency of regarding the present deputation of Captain Knox to Koweit as a permanent appoint ment, and as to the statement to be made to the Turkish Govern ment in reply to the inquiry by the Turkish Ambassador reported in Lord Lansdowne’s Despatch to Mr. Townley of the 20th ultimo, No. 365, viz., that no permanent appointment has been made by His Majesty’s Government which could be regarded as a disturbance of the status quo in those regions, but that, while the mission of Captain Knox is a temporary one, His Majesty’s Government must reserve to them selves the right to depute an officer to visit Koweit from time to time, at their uncontrolled discretion as to time and length of stay, in order to report upon the state of affairs at that place, and to ensure the continuance of the modus vivendi already arrived at. I request, there fore, that you will consider the question of the date to be fixed for the temporary withdrawal of Captain Knox, and inform me of your views on the point. 3. As regards the instructions contained in your Foreign Department letter No. 2918 E.A., dated 7th September 1904, to Major Cox, for the guidance of the Political Agent at Koweit, I observe that it is stated that that officer should endeavour to secure early and accurate informa tion regarding the struggle for the supremacy of Nejd; and that Major Cox has been furnished with copies of my telegram of the 8 th February last, and of your Secret letter of the 26th March last, No. 69.

India Office, k ir ’ _ 13th August 1903. With reference to Sir N. O’Conor’s telegram No. 112, of the 18th ultimo, and to my letter of the 23rd ultimo, forwarding a copy of a telegram to the Viceroy on the subject of the expediency of appointing a British Resident to Koweit, I am directed by Lord George Hamilton to inclose, for Lord Lausdowne s information, a copy of a telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 31st July 1903, reporting the views of the Resident in the Persian Gulf and of the Government of India unon the proposal. As to the Viceroy’s reference to the proposal to place Koweit under the charge of the Consul at IVTohammerah, it appears to Lord George Hamilton that, apart from the reasons which led to the recent decision to retain Mr. McDouall in that post, there are objections to entrusting our relations with the Sheikh of Koweit to a Consular officer residing in Persian territory. Moreover, his Lordship is unable to understand in what respect such an arrangement would he preferable to that which at present exists, by which Koweit is under the general superintendence of the Consul-General at Bushire, who is also Political Resident for the whole of the Persian Gulf, and who has a steam-ship at his disposal for the purpose of visitiug the ports under his charge when it is necessary to do so. With regard to the suggested appointment of a British officer to reside in Koweit, it appears to Lord George Hamilton that such a step would scarcely be in harmony with the admissions which have repeatedly been made by His Majesty’s Government that Koweit is within the Turkish Empire. This point, however, is one pre-eminently for the Foreign Office to consider, and, apart from this, his Lordship is inclined to attach more weight to the reasons given by the Viceroy in favour of the appointment than to those urged against it by Colonel Kemball. As an alternative he would suggest that it will be sufficient for the present to instruct the Consul-General at Bushire to depute an officer to visit Koweit from time to time, remaining there for such period as may be desirable. Business connected with the Sheikh’s relations with Turkish officials at Bussorah would, as at present, be conducted through His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, Sir, 13th August 1903. I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, forwarding copy of atelegram from the Viceroy of India, in which he advocates the appoint- ment of a British Kesident at Koweit, proposed by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, unless the alternative proposal of the Government of India be accepted, that an officer of the Indian Service should be appointed Consul at Mobammerah, who should also have Koweit under his superintendence and be provided with a vessel for the purpose of making frequent visits to that place. As the Secretary of State for India is aware, Lord Lansdowne is of opinion that the Consul at Mohammerah should devote his attention to the verv important questions of trade and roads in that locality and the surrounding districts. It appears to Lord Lansdowne to be undesirable that he should be taken away from these duties for the purpose of dealing with an entirely different class of questions connected with Turkish Arabia. His Lordship is unable to see that there is any force in the argument advanced by the Viceroy that visits to Koweit by His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah would strengthen and recognise the connection between that vilayet and Kow r eit. The Consul is at the present moment the necessary intermediary between the Sheikh and the Vali in the many questions which arise as to the Sheikh’s property, and it might equally be argued that visits by His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire to Bahrein indicate a connection between the latter island and Persia. Lord Lansdowne does not, however, wish to press the proposal, suggested originally by the Secretary of State for India, that the British Consul at Bussorah should be placed in regular superintendence over Koweit. The present system under which His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, or one of his officers, is the ordinary means of communicating with the Sheikh has, on the whole, worked well. On the other hand, the appointment of a British officer to reside at Koweit permanently could scarcely be considered otherwise than as a departure from the status quo, on the maintenance of which His Majesty’s Government have hitherto laid so much stress in these discussions with the Porte, and Lord Lansdowne would be averse to such a measure unless the necessity for it is clearly apparent. If it should be considered expedient to resort to it, it would probably be best that the officer selected should at first visit Koweit temporarily from Bus!lire, and repeat his visits at intervals until his residence became practically permanent.

The arguments m favour of the appointment of a Resident at Koweit are so clearly set forth in the Viceroy’s telegram that I feel there is no necessity to make further remarks, except to express the hope that the proposal may he favourably entertained by His Majesty’s Government. mi n/r n t- I have, &amp;c., The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., N.

Foreign Office, 20 th August 1903. 1 have received your Excellency’s Despatch No. 459 (Secret 1 ), of the 10th instant, advocating the appointment of a British Resident at Koweit. I have already been in communication with the Secretary of State for India in regard to the questions raised in the telegram from the Govern ment of India of the 3lst July, to which your Excellency refers, and I # -p t j• r\cc i _ i o i a transmit for your information From India Office, dated 13th August ■ r- it, i -i • , 1903 ’ * copies of the correspondence* which To ditto, dated 13th August 1903. ^ as passed on the subject. Your Excellency will observe that both Lord G. Hamilton and myself have, after careful consideration, armed at the conclusion that, notwithstanding the various arguments which have been urged in favour of the proposal to appoint a British officer to reside permanently at Koweit, such a course would scarcely be in harmony with the admission which has repeatedly been made by His Majesty’s Government that Koweit is within the Turkish Empire, and could, indeed, hardly be considered otherwise than as a departure from the status quo, on the maintenance of which His Majesty’s Government have laid so much stress in their previous discussions on the subject. I concur in your Excellency’s opinion that His Majesty’s Government may not infrequently find themselves called upon to exercise their influence in restraining the Sheikh from attacking his Arab neighbours, as well as in protecting him from aggression at the hands of the Turkish Government. But that influence has upon more than one occasion been so exercised under existing conditions, and a perusal of the printed con fidential correspondence during the months of September and October S. 53. bi w * 1901 in particular shows that the mediation of the Political Resident and of British Naval officers in the Persian Gulf was successfully employed at a time of serious inter-tribal disturbance, and that it was received by the Turkish Government with satisfaction. The conclusion of the hostilities then in progress between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Amir of Nejd was followed by an amicable under standing with the Turkish Government, recorded in my_ note to Anthopoulo Pasha of the 11th September 1901, which has since that date formed the basis of the relations between the two Governments, and the adoption of the present proposal might seriously impair its successful continuance. . His Majesty’s Government are, therefore, of opinion that it will be best, for the present at least, to avoid raising a difficult and inconvenient f question with the Turkish Government by appointing a British officer to reside permanently at ICoweit, and that it will be sufficient that an officer should be deputed by the Consul-General at Bushire to visit Koweit from time to time, remaining there for such time as may be desirable, and, if necessary, repeating his visits at intervals until his residence becomes practically permanent. For the reasons stated in the correspondence inclosed in this despatch they are also of opinion that the attention of His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah will be more profitably directed to the very important questions in that locality, and they consider that business connected with the relations of the Sheikh with Turkish officials at Bussorah should be conducted as heretofore through His Majesty’s Consul at that place.

Lord Lansdowne concurs in SirN. O’Conor’s opinion that there is no objection to the proposal. The second paragraph of the Despatch deals with more general questions, and I am to request that Mr. Secretary Brodrick’s attention may be particularly called to his Excellency’s observations in regard to possible representations by the Turkish Government on the subject of the appointment of a British Agent at Koweit. The Turkish autho rities have already taken notice of the change, as will be seen from the Despatch to Mr. Townley, No. 363, copy of which is enclosed, and it appears to Lord Lansdowne very desirable to decide what answer should be returned to any further enquiries which may be made. After correspondence between the two Departments in August 1903 the conclusion was arrived at “ that it would be best, for the present at “ least, to avoid raising a difficult and inconvenient question with the “ Turkish Government by appointing a British officer to reside “ permanently at Koweit, and that it would be sufficient that an officer “ should be deputed by the Consul-General at Bushire to visit Koweit “ from time to time, remaining there for such time as might be “ desirable, and, if necessary, repeating his visits at intervals until his “ residence becomes practically permanent.” His Majesty’s Government are, therefore, in a position to maintain that no permanent appointment has been made by them which could be regarded as a disturbance of the status quo in those regions, and Lord Lansdowne would suggest that the Turkish Government should be so informed if they raise the question.

My letter introducing Captain Knox is reproduced in the first paragraph of the Sheikh’s communication. I have not, therefore, thought it necessary to forward a copy separately. J Translation of a letter from Sheikn Mubarak, Chief of Koweit, to Major P. Z. Cox CJ.E Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 7th August 1904. I have received your letter, dated 4th August, in which you inform me that the Government of India has sent Captain Knox as the representative of the British Government in my territory ; that he will look after my interests and render me help in my affairs; that this is in accordance with a telegram ; and that, on receipt of a letter from Government, you will let me know details’; that I should give friendly assistance in setting apart a house for him to live in till permanent arrangements are made. I have accordingly accepted Captain Knox with honour, and out of the houses available, the best will be given to him after putting it in order. Until then, he will remain in my house which belongs to the British Government. I entertain friendship for you and no one else from my heart, on account of the justice of your Government and the protection which one receives from it when he seeks refuge with it. I do not see any one else who entertains so much good feelings towards you as myself. I have subjected myself to you, not because I had suffered disadvantages, but have done so merely for the sake of the good feeling between us. Till now, however, I have not received relief from your Government as to the losses which I suffer at the hands of the Turks in connec tion with my property and subjects, and all this without any cause and only on account of my friendship for you. I still behave well with them, but it is all in vain. Notwithstanding this, although theirs is a big Government, I have done them favours as far as it lay in my power, both pecuniary and personal. I have already shown you what good I have done for them. Please God, I say that, from to-day and henceforth, I see from the British Government friendship and protec tion for my interests and honour. I at present am paying all honour to Captain Knox, as I thereby see that I will have peace and secure protection of my rights. If I will not get the same, no good will result to me from the stay of Captain Knox. I preserve with me a copy of this letter of mine and your letter. Captain Knox will of course let you know what he experienced from me as regards respect and honour. Please God, I am ready to do still more honour to him. I No. 269, dated the 16th August 1904.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your esteemed letter of 7th August, telling me of Captain Knox’s arrival and of your fitting reception of him. In this you have not failed, as I well knew you would not, and I have received the most gratifying accounts from Captain Knox of the kindness and honourable hospitality with which you have received him, and for this I thank you very much from myself and my Government.

I am directed hy my Association to “bring to your notice that although almost every important port in the Persian Gulf has a post office the ports of Daboi and Koweit which are also “becoming centres of trade with India have none. The British India Steam navigation Company's steamers have now been calling at these ports every fortnight but in the absence of post office merchants have to send their letters and shipping documents through passengers or their friends at other ports, the result being that -they reacli|jvery irrlgularly or sometimes not reach -v at all. You are well aware that the very first and the most important factor in trade is the postal arrangement without which it is almost impossible to develop it to any great ex tent. My Association therefore request that you will be good enough to give this matter your kind consideration and arrange to open post office at the above-named ports so that business arrangements with these places may be greatly facilitated. 0 O 0draft telegram.

It appears to Lord Lansdowne that a misunderstand ing has arisen with regard to the detention of the officer who has been selected for the post of Political Agent at Koweit. The letter from this office of the 21st ultimo conveyed His Lordship*s concurrence in the proposal of the Government of India that Major Knox should proceed at once to Koweit and the subsequent letter of the 25th ultimo which suggested postponing the establishment of the British Post Office was not intended in any way to affect the movements of the Political Agent v/hich had already been decided upon. I am therefore to suggest that the Government of India should at once be requested to instruct Major K&gt; Knox Ine Under Secretary of State India Office. RECEIVED 26JUL1904Confidential.
