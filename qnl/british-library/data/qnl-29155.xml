Persian Affairs. Political. CONFIRMATION of the news that the Moscow Conference failed to come to an agreement concerning Persia has caused despair bordering upon panic, an it is impossible to predict which way the Persian cat, in its present state ot terror, will jump. Hakimi’s Government may decide, after all, to adhere to the drait Anglo-American proposal and put it up to the Russians. It may prefer its own version and court a rebuff by proposing it. It may prefer to use the machinery o the United Nations Organisation. It may decide to do nothing till the 2nd March and hope that the Russians will abide by their treaty obligations and remove their forces by that date. It may decide to negotiate direct with the Soviet Government, in which case it is not unlikely that the Russians will reply that they will only negotiate with a Government not known to be hostile to themselves, by which, o course, they mean a Government which will be prepared to grant them their t\\o main objects, viz., the holding of the new Majlis elections on the due date and the ^ranting of an oil concession in north-west Persia. Again, the Hakimi Go\ em inent may fall and be replaced by another more inclined to resist Russian piessuie. In regard to the above, one bet seems as good as another. 2. Meanwhile, impatience over Hakimi’s inertia is growing and much lobbying is being done on behalf of various possible successors. Hidayet has left the Cabinet on appointment as ambassador to Kabul. Muhammad Husain Firuz, fore- seeiiiG the fall of the Cabinet, has resigned. Allahyar Saleh is making many changes among the higher officials of the Ministry of the Interior, apparently in the hope of placating the Russians. The Prime Minister has informed the Minister for War that, in the face of the increasing attacks on the aimy fiom the Tudeh press, he does not feel that he can retain for much longer either General Riazi or General Arfa, the Chief of General Staff. 3. On the 1st January the American Ambassador, acting on instructions from the State Department,* gave to the Persian Prime Minister an outline of the Anglo-American scheme for a tripartite commission to advise the Persian Govern ment as to the election of provincial councils. On the same day the British Ambas sador, on his return from Moscow and London, saw the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and gave them a sketch of the course of the negotia tions in Moscow, and also a Persian translation of the final draft of the scheme which is reproduced as an appendix to this summary. The Prime Minister agreed to call a special meeting of the Cabinet to discuss it. If agreement to accept the proposals in principle were reached the Prime Minister was to inform the two embassies so that the two Secretaries of State could make statements and thus ensure discussion of the proposals in the press of the two countries. Fortified by this support, the Prime Minister would then report to the Majlis. Unfortunately, the proposal was not laid before the Cabinet till the 4th January. Much opposition to the proposal was encountered, it is believed, from Nariman, the appeasement monger, since Salih, the other pro-Russian, who would certainly have opposed it, was absent. The Cabinet proceeded to maul and mangle the draft so as to make it almost unrecognisable. The clause about the Turki language was cut out and a nonsensical proposal to add two Persian members to the commission was added. The British Ambassador assured the Minister for Foreign Affairs at a subsequent meeting that the draft, as amended by the Cabinet, had no chance of success, that His Majesty’s Government could not support it, and that such an [73-^-144]attitude on the part of the Persian Government would give their opponents a powerful instrument to use against them, whereas the Anglo-American draft had more chance of success, as it had at one time even been agreed to by Stalin. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the Prime Minister on these points and the Cabinet is now reconsidering the draft. The Majlis. 4. At the session of the 30th December Deputy Tehranchi interpellated the Government stating that Hakimi’s Cabinet had failed to solve the problem of Azerbaijan, to reform the Administration or to clarify their foreign policy. According to the Constitution a month’s delay in answering an interpellation is allowed, but it is expected that Hakimi will reply within a few days. The Minister of Justice tabled a Bill to provide for more severe penalties for infringe ment of traffic laws. The Minister for War tabled a Bill to provide relief for the dependents of officers killed in the recent Azerbaijan disturbances. At the session of the 1st January Dr. Musaddiq made one of his frequent attacks on the Govern ment, the charge, on this occasion, being that their economic policy was to the detriment of the country. The Minister of Finance replied. At the same session it was decided to send the papers of the Tadayyun case to the Supreme Court of Appeal. (It will be recalled that Tadayyun was impeached about two years ago on the charge of having taken bribes while Minister of the Interior to ensure the election of certain Deputies.) At the session of the 3rd January a Bill was passed to provide a loan of 5 million rials at cheap rates for shopkeepers who lost their property in the recent fire at Qazvin. Further discussion took place on the Bill to raise the status of “contract” (i.e., non-covenanted) Government employees to that of “official” {i.e., covenanted) employees. The debate on the 3/12ths Budget Bill was resumed but was not completed. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 5. A report from consular sources states that an affray has occurred between Democrat forces and Afshar tribesmen at Shahin Dazh, about 50 miles south-east of Miandoab and the same distance north-east of Saqqiz. Two lorry-loads of reinforcements from the Azerbaijan Peoples army are said to have been sent from Tabriz. The Chief of General Staff confirms this news and states that similar • clashes are reported from near Zenj an, from a village named Chahar Oinak, south of Zenjan, and from a village called Uriad between Maragheh and Mianeh. The Chief of General Staff also stated that in all these four skirmishes the Democrat troops had been repulsed with loss of life and arms. 6. According to a press report Ghulam Yahya, Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Defence in the Azerbaijan National Government, has been killed on the Tabriz-Mianeh road by three unknown assailants disguised as Democrat soldiers. Revenge for several political murders contrived by Ghulam Yahya is given as the motive for the crime. Kurdistan. 7. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 48, paragraph 15, the Iraqi Govern ment have now admitted that Hama Rashid fled from Kirkuk, where he was living under surveillance, on the 23rd December, 1945. They state that a search is being made for him by police and military in the Pen j win area. Meanwhile, according to information received by the Persian General Staff, Hama Rashid has arrived at Mahabad, where he is concocting further plans of revolt with Ghazi Muhammad. Gilan 8. Some days ago Muzaffarzadeh, a Deputy for Resht, read out in the Majlis a telegram addressed to the Prime Minister by his constituents. They demanded reforms, a purge of the Administration in general and of the General Staff in particular, the banishment of Seyyid Zia-ud-Din and that 50 per cent, of the taxes collected from Gilan be spent on Gilan. The Prime Minister has replied by saying that he sympathises with their desire for reforms and promises that the forth coming elections for provincial councils will be entirely free. 9. The manager of the National Bank at Resht, on instructions from Tehran, has deposited 10 million rials in the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran.Appointments. 10.—(i) Hasan Ali Kemal-Hidayet (Nasr-ul-Mulk), Minister without Port folio, to be Persian Ambassador at Kabul vice Abul Qasim Najm, who vacated that post recently to become Minister for Foreign Affairs. (ii) Ismail Bahadur to be Governor of Yezd vice Haidari. (iii) Dr. Husain Marzeban (Said-ul-Mulk) to be Governor of Khurramabad. (iv) Abdul Husain Shabdiz to be Governor of Arak (Sultanabad). (v) Mubasir Roshan to be Governor of Malayir. (vi) Ibrahim Shahin to be Governor of Qazvin. (vii) Abdullah Ashrafi to be Governor of Shahabad. (viii) Ali Mansur, the former Governor-General of Khorasan, has been appointed a member of the High Council of the National Bank in place of Husain Ala, now Persian Ambassador in Washington. Obituary. 11. The Imam Jumeh of Tehran died on the 5th January, aged about 75. He was a brother of Seyyid Muhammad Jawad, Zahir-ul-Islam (M.A 131). Though keeping in the background, he was not without influence in political as well as religious circles. He and his brother had always been friendly to the British. Economic. 12. The Cabinet have now approved a proposal by the Ministry of Finance that merchants should now be free to import motor vehicles and tyres without Government control, provided that full import dues are paid. (The import duty on motor vehicles is about 22 per cent, ad valorem.) This follows logically on other recent steps taken by the Persian Government to free trade from Government monopolies and controls. Persian A rmy. 13. The Officer Commanding Ardebil garrison and some more officers of the Tabriz garrison have arrived in Tehran. Colonel Zanganeh, the commandant of the Rezaiyeh brigade, is also expected in a few days. This completes the evacua tion of the officers of the Azerbaijan garrisons, less those killed, the one renegade and three forcibly detained by the rebel army as instructors in the mortar, of which a number have fallen into rebel hands and in the use of which the People’s army apparently requires further instruction. British Interests. 14. His Excellency the British Ambassador returned to Tehran from the Moscow Conference on the 1st January. 15. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has been approached for permission to open an Indian Trade Exhibition in Persia. The tentative date is 1947. A merican Interests. 16. The personnel of the American mission with the Persian gendarmerie as on the 29th December, 1945, were as follows — Colonel H. N. Schwarzkopf, head of the mission. Colonel R. Goode. Lieutenant-Colonel A. C. Molter. Lieutenant-Colonel A. N. Papa. Lieutenant-Colonel W. Preston (due to be replaced by Lieutenant-Colonel A. N. Wood in two weeks). Major J. Diefendorf. Major G. H. Biggs. Major R. Waters (due to arrive in about two months). 17. The American Government has obtained the consent of the Persian Government for the temporary operation by T.W.A. of air-line facilities pre viously provided by the A.T.C. at Abadan. This, they state, is necessary in view of the accelerated evacuation of American troops from Iran and to bring home American troops from India (see Intelligence Summary No. 41. paragraph 8).4 f 4 Appendix. Anglo-American Draft of Tri/partite Commission for Iranian Affairs, *25th December, 1945. 1 HE Governments of Great Britain, U.S.S.R. and the United States have agreed on the formation of a Tripartite Commission for Iranian questions and are submitting this agreement to the Iranian Government for their concurrence. The terms of reference are as follows :— 1. The commission shall take as its point of departure the fact that, during the presence in Persia of Allied troops, the Persian economy and governmental organisation have been disturbed and difficulties have arisen between the Central Government and the inhabitants of certain provinces. The Three Powers recognise that they may have some responsibility for this and should therefore endeavour to assist the Persian State in re-establishing normal conditions to the satisfaction of all elements of the population and maintaining friendly relations with other countries. 2. With a view to removing the apprehensions of the Iranian Government and causes of international friction, the commission shall deal with the question of the acceleration as far as possible of the withdrawal of Allied troops from Iran and make appropriate recommendations to the Governments of the Three Powers. 3. The commission shall keep in mind (a) the undertaking given by Great Britain and Soviet Russia in the treaty of January 1942 to respect the political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Persia; and (b) the declara tion about Persia issued during the Tehran Conference by President Roosevelt, Generalissimo Stalin and Mr. Churchill. 4. With a view to reconciling the existing differences between the central Persian Government and certain provinces of the country, the commission shall advise and assist the Persian Government in the establishment of provincial councils, in accordance with the provisions of the Persian Constitution. 5. The recommendations of the commission (which must receive the approval of the Three Governments before being submitted to the Persian Government) shall cover the whole of Persia, including Azerbaijan. 6. Existing laws amplifying the relevant provisions of the Constitution (with respect to provincial councils) shall be taken as the point of departure, but the commission shall recommend any amendments which seem to be required, especially in regard to the elections to the local councils, the powers and duties of the councils and the manner in which they are to be furnished with funds. 7. The commission shall also make recommendations as to the free use of the minority languages, such as Arabic, Turki and Kurdish, for educational and other purposes. 8. The commission shall consult closely with the Persian Government and with representatives of all important elements of the population in the process of formulating its recommendations. 9. The Three Powers shall use their best endeavours to persuade the Persian Government to pass into law and to put into execution the recommendations made by the commission. 10. The commission shall make no recommendation which would weaken the fundamental unity of the Persian State. 11. The first provincial elections shall be carried out under the supervision of the commission.

Persian Affairs. Political. OPPOSITION to the Anglo-American proposal for the tripartite com mission has increased during the past week. The Tudeh and others under Russian influence, as was to be expected, showed their hostility, but attacks from the so-called “ Right ” were no less bitter. The one constant factor in the Persians unstable make-up, his vanity, was offended at the thought that others could see anything needing reform in his administration. “ Unwarranted inter ference,” “ a repetition of the 1907 agreement ” were phrases bandied about by Dr. Musaddiq and others. The Cabinet has as yet come to no decision and if it does not do so very soon it will certainly fall. A feeling (more in evidence among the Deputies than among the Cabinet) that they have been abandoned by the British and American Governments (whereas, in fact, it is they who have abandoned the Anglo-American scheme without proposing any alternative) may lead the Persians in their despair to incline more and more to appeasement of the Russians and to the introduction as Prime Minister of Qawam-us-Saltaneh, the Russian candidate. The Cabinet, it is believed, is now thinking less of direct negotiations with the Azerbaijan National Government or with the Soviet Government and more about an appeal to the Security Council of the United Nations Organisation. A zerbaijan. 2. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General in Tabriz reports that the new autonomous Government has revised the income tax law of 1943 and now demands that the tax be paid in a lump sum instead of in instalments. The tax free portion of income is said to have been fixed at 25 per cent. 3. Merchants’ goods, other than food-stuffs, may now be despatched to Tehran on an undertaking by the owner that the proceeds of the sale will be returned to Azerbaijan. The despatch of parcels and money to Tehran by post is prohibited. All passengers to Tehran must obtain journey permits from the “ Ministry of the Interior.” All baggage and correspondence is liable to examination by the police. 4. A “ Friends of Soviet Azerbaijan ” Society has been formed, ostensibly for strengthening cultural tics. 5. The Azerbaijan Government is overprinting Persian postage stamps with the words “National Government of Azerbaijan, 21st Azar 1324.” 6. A notice was sent out by the Azerbaijan Government summoning all democrats in Tabriz to appear at 6 a.m. on the 11th January. As those over 45 years of age were excluded it was thought and widely rumoured that this foreshadowed some military move on the capital. The meeting was subsequently postponed. Gilan and Mazanderan. 7. A Persian press report mentions the fusion in these provinces of the Tudeh, Democrat and Jangali parties. The revival, under Russian auspices, of the last named is interesting, and recalls the exploits of the Jangalis under Kuehik Khan in 1917, who, with Bolshevik backing, constituted a serious threat to Persian and British interests in the Caspian region. A confidential report by the Officer Commanding Gendarmerie Regiment of Mazanderan (Headquarters, Sari), shown to the British Military Attach^ by a senior Persian officer at Gendarmerie Headquarters in Tehran, gives some interesting facts about the local situation. All Persian officials from the Governor downwards are under [73—1811 -— * iTudeh supervision. No Government official is allowed to send telegraphic messages in code. No movements of gendarmerie can take place without prior permission of the Tudeh. The railway administration is completely under Tudeh control. The author of the report is of the opinion that Mazanderan can be taken over by the Tudeh party when it wishes to do so. Qazvin. 8. Some rioting on a small scale is reported from Qazvin in connexion with the elections for provincial councils. Two Ministry of Interior inspectors have been sent to investigate. Hamadan. 9. The Chief of General Staff informed the British Military Attache that the four clashes with the democrat rebel forces (referred to in paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary) were, in fact, the work of guerilla bands of partisans which the General Staff had organised and armed as part of a resistance move ment. The four bands so far organised are each in charge of an officer and work with the Garus and Zenjan branches of the Afshars and the Zulfiqar and Kazemi families, who are loyal supporters of Government in that neighbourhood. They are armed with obsolete patterns of Persian army rifles. They have strict orders to avoid clashes with Red army personnel when in uniform. While some see in this the germ of civil war in Persia and deplore the possible results, the General Staff, seeing the apathy or cowardice displayed by the present Government and seeing the lack of success so far achieved by British and American intervention on Persia’s behalf, cannot be blamed for taking steps to prevent further infiltra tion southwards of rebel forces from the Russian Zone. (The Chief of General Staff has requested that the existence of this resistance movement be kept secret.) Iranian State Railway. 10. A number of armed democrats, estimated by the Persian General Staff at about a thousand, headed by the Tudeh leader Sarabi, held a meeting recently in Semnan after which they forcibly deported the Governor. They held up the train due to leave for Tehran on Thursday but allowed it to proceed on Saturday. No train has arrived from Zen j an since Thursday. In answer to telegraphic enquiries, the Russian Movements Staff first said that the line was snow-bound, then that a strike was in progress and lastly that the train ‘ ‘ would not be proceeding.” It is believed that fighting between Democrats and Government supporters in the vicinity of the railway line near Zen j an may be the cause of the interruption in traffic. Meanwhile, with characteristic futility, the Persian railway administration has been despatching trains both to Semnan and Zen j an thus affording free transport for any rebel move on the capital—a contingency hitherto supported by rumour only. Pars. 11. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 47, paragraph 8, His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, states that the offer of the monthly allowance of 30,000 rials by Nasir Khan Qashgai was made not to Ali Khan but to Amir Husain Khan, one of the sons of the late Sardar Instisham, a half-brother of Ali Khan. Bakhtiari (reference Intelligence Summary No. 49, paragraph 14). 12. There is some hope of a settlement between Murteza Quli Khan and his opponents among the Bakhtiari. Jehan Shah Khan, his son, has approached His Majesty’s Consul, Isfahan, with a proposed agreement reached between him and Abdur Reza Bakhtiar, who is a cousin of Abul Qasim Khan. (Abul Qasim, being a son of Amir Mufakham, is of the Haji Ilkhani family, whereas Murteza Quli Khan belongs to the rival branch of the Ilkhani.) The' agreement which, on the recommendation of His Majesty’s Consul, Isfahan, it is believed Murteza Quli Khan will accept, is as follows :— (i) Murteza Quli Khan should remain as Governor of Bakhtiari; (ii) Jehan Shah Khan should act for him in current business; (iii) Abdur Reza should be appointed assistant to the Governor, to represent the interests of the Haji Ilkhanis; (iv) Amir Bahman should retire from the affairs of the tribe and reside at Isfahan.Khuzestan. 13. On the 9th January Sheikh Abdullah, the fourth and slightly demented son of the late Sheikh Khazal (Sheikh of Muhammerah) crossed from Iraq into Persia and established himself with some armed retainers in one of his father’s old palaces at Fahliyeh (some 4 miles upstream of Khorramshahr) from which he evicted the four Persian gendarmes who were on guard there. He then proceeded to occupy Gusbeh (on Abadan Island), but on the approach of Persian troops which the General Officer Commanding, Persian Army Division of Khuzistan, had despatched against him with commendable promptitude, Sheikh Abdullah fled into Iraq. Some comment has been heard to the effect that in the British “ Zone,” unlike the Russian, Persian troops are allowed to move freely and are even encouraged by the British military authorities to deal with disorder promptly and in their own way. Persian A rmy. 14. The officers who deserted from the Meshed garrison at the time of the recent mutiny (see Intelligence Summary No. 34, paragraph 6), are now reported to have joined up with the Democrats in Azerbaijan and to have been appointed to positions in the Azerbaijan People’s army. Colonel Nawai is stated to be in Zenjan and Colonel Azar, a deserter from the General Staff at Tehran, to be holding the post of Director of Recruiting. 15. A further batch of officers of the Azerbaijan division has recently arrived in Tehran accompanied by their families. In Zenjan they had been closely examined and detained for a day by the Democrat road picquets. They were relieved of all their spare clothing and cash in excess of 150 rials (about £1 35.) per person. Owing to lack of transport, many of the officers were unable to bring their families with them. 16. The composition of the court-martial to be assembled for the trial of General Darakshani, the former General Officer Commanding, Tabriz, has been announced, though that fact, in itself, is no indication that the trial will ever take place. Persian Gendarmerie. 17. Seven new regiments of gendarmerie are at present in process of formation in Tehran. They will eventually be centred on Tabriz, Rezaieh, Tehran, Meshed, Mazanderan (Sari) and Bujnurd. The two destined for Tabriz and Rezaieh will be replacements for those which were completely lost (except for about 100 officers and men who managed to return to Tehran) in the recent disturbances. All these new regiments are for the Russian occupied zone and it is intended that they should be trained and ready to follow on the heels of the departing Soviet troops when they evacuate the country by the 2nd March. There will, therefore, be an additional five regiments to the gendarmerie force as a whole making a total of eighteen. Whereas hitherto the squads, of which there are sixteen per company, contained only six men each, owing to overall shortage of personnel, the new regiments will have squads of eight men, bringing the company strength up to 172. There are nine companies per regiment, which, allowing for battalion and regimental headquarters personnel gives an approxi mate total strength per regiment of 1,862. There is now a total of four motorised companies, an addition of two in the last six months. A total of eight is visualised. It appears, however, that the supply of further equipment from the United States in the form of the 500 vehicles and wireless sets for a ” net ’ ’ of ten stations for which Colonel Schwarzkopf negotiated during his visit to America in April 1945 (see Intelligence Summary No. 28, paragraph 6, of the 22nd July, 1945), has not been obtained due to the Persian Government’s lack of dollars. Appointments. 18. Jawad Daryabegi to be Director-General in the Ministry of Agriculture. A dministration. 19. The Governorate of Garus (on the Qizil Uzun river about 100 miles north of Hamadan) which hitherto formed a part of the Fourth Gqvernorate- General (Western Azerbaijan) has been brought under the direct administration of Tehran.4 Economic. 20. Stocks of wheat, flour and barley held in the Tehran silo on the 10th January are reported to have been approximately 46,000 tons, of which barley accounts for 12,000 tons. Owing to the recent events in Azerbaijan 45,000 tons of cereals belonging to the Government have not been transported to Tehran, and it has therefore been decided to suspend the sale of barley for the time being. In addition to the stocks held 17 or 18 tons of wheat and barley are delivered daily in Tehran from Government properties in the Kermanshah, Hamadan and Qazvin areas. The daily consumption of cereals in Tehran, as measured by issues made by the Tehran silo, is reported to be 170 tons, while the bakers are said to bring a further 130 tons from other sources. British Interests. 21. yarious Persian newspapers have reported the handing back of the port of Khorramshahr to the Persian Government by the British military authorities. This news is incorrect. It was the Persian naval base at Khorramshahr which was handed back to the Persian military authorities (in the absence of the Persian navy) on the 23rd December, 1945. American Interests. 22. On the 8th January all Russian papers came out with a Tass agency report to the effect that Mr. Rossow, the new American Consul in Tabriz, had met Pishaveri the Prime Minister of the Azerbaijan National Government, had expressed his pleasure at meeting him and, through him, tendered his greetings to the new Azerbaijan Government. After some conversation on the subject of future plans and recognition by the Persian Government, the consul is reported to have promised every support to the new Government. The United States Embassy in Tehran have denied any knowledge of any such call having been paid and deny any statements regarding help from the United States Government. Belgian Interests. 23. His Excellency Count Antoine de Laubespin, the new Belgian Minister, presented his letters of credence to His Imperial Majesty the Shah on the 12th January.

Political. DURING the past week the Cabinet and Deputies have been wandering about m a political Kavir. Lacking chart, compass or objective, they are yet surprised that they have not attained their journey’s end. Having finally rejected the Anglo-American suggestion of a tripartite advisory commission, the Government wasted a precious fortnight before it decided to appeal to the U.N.O. Having announced its intention to do so, it neither follows it up with detailed instructions to its representative nor seeks the agreement of the Majlis to what it had done. In regard to Deputy Teh ranch i’s interpellation of the 30th December, the Prime Minister has come to an agreement with its author that he will withdraw it, not in order that Hakimi may remain in office, but in order that he may resign. Another Deputy has made a fresh interpellation with a view to retaining Hakimi for, according to the law, a Prime Minister may not resign till he has replied to an interpellation. Dr. Musaddiq, consistent only in his inconsistency, at first urged an appeal to the U.N.O. during his attacks on the Anglo-American suggestion, but now, when the appeal has been made, states that he did not really urge this but merely wanted Persia to retain the right to do so. Hakimi is reputed to desire to regain the support of some of his former adherents who, alarmed at the appeasement tactics of Nariman and Saleh, had fallen away. He cannot, according to the law, purge his Cabinet of these two by dismissing them. He intends to resign and re-form his Cabinet without them. He does not appear to realise that he may not be re-elected, and that this will pave the way for Qawam-us-Saltaneh, whose intentions, if elected, of giving the Russians what they want have already been made known. Neither does he appear to realise that the resignation of a Government, which a moment before made an appeal to the U.N.O., will have a disastrous effect on the reception of that appeal. To complete this Mad Hatter’s tea party, a group of generals, announcing themselves as disgusted with Hakimi s inertia and its effect on Persia’s security, are planning to overthrow him and form a Cabinet themselves under the leadership of no other than Qawam-us-Saltaneh! Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 2. The elections for the municipality of Tabriz have been held by the Azerbaijan National Government. The council will consist of sixty-five members with a smaller Executive Committee. Similar councils, but smaller will be elected shortly for other towns in Azerbaijan. _ ?■ The . formation of a Government trading company with a capital of 20 million rials has been announced. Half the capital is to be subscribed by the public with easy payment terms for workers and peasants wishing to obtain shares The company will undertake all export and import trade and will ensure that all profits are returned to Azerbaijan. The Prime Minister of the Azerbaijan National Government has announced the introduction of legislation to regulate trade. He also mentions negotiations through “ proper channels ” to establish direct trade relations with neighbouring foreign countries. The Azerbaijan Ministry of Finance announces that all goods entering Azerbaijan must nav customs duties whether they have paid elsewhere in Persia or not ' [74—18]Iranian State Railway (see paragraph 10 of last Intelligence Summary). 4. The Democrats are running a train service between Mianeh and Zenjan. They have retained some sixty wagons and six locomotives for this purpose. They have refused to remit to Tehran the railway earnings. Qazvin. 5. The Journal de Tehran, in its issue of the 15th January, gives the names ^ of Dr. Afzal, Navid, Farhudi, Razavi and Pakravan as having been elected to the Provincial Council. Enquiries are being made into the antecedents of the above, but with Qazvin in complete control by the Russians, it is assumed that they are all staunch Tudeh members. Khuzistan (see paragraph 13 of last Intelligence Summary). 6. It is now learned that Sheikh Abdullah, hearing that Iraqi forces had also been set in motion against him, took refuge in Koweit. Semnan (see paragraph 10 of last Intelligence Summary). 7. The Tudeh Democrats, under the leadership of Iskandar Sarabi, are said to be in complete control of the town. The Tudeh, under Russian advice, completely control all railway operatives from the railway junction of Garmsar eastwards to Shahrud and northwards to Bandar Shah. . Yezd. 8. Sadri, the former Governor of Yezd, was relieved by Bahadur on the 8th January. The new Governor, one of Saleh’s earliest appointments, is reputed to have strong leftist leanings. Yezd, it will be recalled, is Seyyid Zia-ud-Din’s constituency. Fars. 9. According to a consular report, some consternation among the Qashgai has been caused by the rumoured advent to power of Qawam-us-Saltaneh. A report, received in the General Staff from the General Officer Commanding Fars Division and almost certainly exaggerated, states that after a recent meeting in Firuzabad resolutions were taken by the Qashgai to start a rebellion if Qawam-us- Saltaneh became Prime Minister. Bakhtiari (see paragraph 12 of last Intelligence Summary). 10. As a result of further discussions between the Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani branches of the tribe, a new proposal has been put to Murteza Quli Khan whereby all the leading khans to the number of thirteen will be represented in the governorship and, what is far more important, secure a share of the pickings. Whether the Bakhtiari will gain from being ruled by thirteen thieves instead of one remains to he seen. Khorasan. 11. The Russians are reported to be active in attempting to gain the goodwill of the religious authorities, who have not forgotten the bombardment of the shrine by Cossack artillery at the time of the Persian revolution. The Russians have now tried to curry favour by constructing a well near the shrine at their own charges. Kurdistan (South). 12. With the surrender of Hassan Khan Rezabi to the Persian military the situation is returning to normal. General Humayuni has been able to with draw his outposts and concentrate his troops in Merivan, Sardasht, Senneh and Saqqiz with detachments at Tikab (formerly Tikan Tappeh) and Bijar. Bukan, some 50 miles north of Saqqiz, is the nearest place known to be in rebel hands. Kermanshah. 13. Some increased Tudeh activity is noticed as the result of the prepara tions for the new Provincial Councils.Persian A vmy. 14. Although money was recently voted by the Majlis for the formation of two extra infantry divisions, only one is at present envisaged. It is being formed in Hamadan from conscripts of the Hamadan and Bijar districts and will eventually be named as an Azerbaijan Division. 15. His Majesty’s Consul-General, Tabriz, has reported the numbers on some ^rifles seen in rebel hands in Azerbaijan. They were in English figures and were in the series 60,000 or 90,000. Enquiries from the General Staff have elicited the information that rifles bearing those series of numbers formed part of the 100,000 sold by the Persian army from surplus stocks to the Russians through the British in 1942. The Court. 16. According to a press report, His Imperial Majesty the Shah is now convalescent after a chill. A 'ppuintments. 17. —{i) His Imperial Majesty the Shah has appointed Dr. Mir Seyyid Hasan Imami to be Imam Jum’eh of Tehran. He is a relative of the recently deceased Imam Jumeh and is a doctor of law as well as a doctor of Muslim theology. (ii) Dr. Ali Sajjadi, formerly Governor of Saveh, to be an inspector in the Ministry of the Interior. (iii) Ahmed Karubi to be Governor of Saveh. (iv) Sadiq Shahbazi to be Governor of Sirjan. (v) Ali Asghar Kaivani to be counsellor to the Persian Legation in Bagdad, (vi) Abul Fazl Shahrukhi to be Persian Consul at Suleimanieh. British Interests. 18. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are experiencing difficulties in obtaining passes for their officials from the Russians to travel on duty in the Russian occupied zone. 19. Agents for M.O. 1 publications have refused to take delivery of any material intended for distribution in North-West Persia. They say that the Democrats will not permit these publications to be taken into Azerbaijan. A merican Interests. 20. A party of twenty-six American technicians recently visited Mehrabad aerodrome. Their visit was in connexion with the provisional agreement recently secured by T.W.A. (see paragraph 17 of Intelligence Summary No. 1). P.S.—A Persian press report, as yet unconfirmed, states that Nariman, the Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones, has resigned. He continues to hold the office of Mayor of Tehran. News has just be received of the resignation of Hakimi, the Prime Minister. Reliable details are not yet available, but it is believed that His Imperial Majesty the Shah forced him to this step.

Persian A ffairs. Political AS reported in a postscript to last Intelligence Summary, Hakimi tendered his resignation to His Imperial Majesty The Shah on the 20th January. On the 26th January the Majlis chose Qawam-us-Saltaneh as his successor by 52 votes, 51 being cast for Husain Pirnia (Mutamin-ul-Mulk), (F.O. 171—MlA. 212), and 1 for Hakimi. In a letter to the press, Hakimi is reported to have said that, having represented his country’s case to U.N.O., he had done his duty and was prepared to resign. Apart from the unceasing hostility of the Left, who, at Russian instigation, opposed his policy of appealing to U.N.O., Hakimi’s Govern ment had lost many of its erstwhile supporters from the Right by the actions of Nariman and Saleh, whose appeasement tactics were displeasing and endangered their chances in the future elections. The Qawam-us-Saltaneh’s supporters had been most active on his behalf, even spreading false reports that His Majesty’s Embassy entirely approved of his policy and had withdrawn any objections to his candidature. After receipt of the Royal Firman Qawam has now to select his Cabinet and present them and his Government’s programme befo v e the Majlis. Having but a narrow majority, he will be obliged to offer some Cabinet posts to the Right. How far he will go in submission to the Russians is not for the moment predictable, but neither he, nor any other Persian, would see anything illogical o v incongruous in now opening direct negotiations with the Russians although hits Government has previously lodged with U N O. an appeal against the Russians. A d ministration. 2. According to the press, elections for provincial and city councils have been concluded at Shahi and Sari in Mazanderan and at Birjand in East Persia. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 3. Little news of importance has come out of Azerbaijan during the past week. His Majesty’s acting consul-general reports that there are still no signs whatever of any Russian military withdrawal It is not upon the absence of such signs or preparatory measures that the acting consul-general bases his opinion that the Russians do not intend to leave by the 2nd March. Indeed, having no dis posable assets or heavy stores or equipment, they could steal away as silently as any Arab. It is upon the fact that their departure would cause the instant collapse of the Democrat movement, the ruin of all they have built in the past four years, and much loss of face among their Persian hirelings, that he bases his opinion. A further reference to the Russians’ right to keep troops in Persia by virtue of the Perso-Soviet Treaty of 1921, made this time by M. Vyshinsky before the U.N.O., lends colour to the views expressed by His Majesty’s acting consul-general. 4. There are no indications that progress is being made in the Autonomous Kurdistan movement. Pishehvari, the Azerbaijan Government Prime Minister, is reported to have said in conversation with the American Consul that the Kurds were not yet ready for such a movement. The Russians are clearly keeping the two issues of autonomy for Azerbaijan and Kurdistan quite separate. Iranian State Railway. 5. No trains are running between Tehran and Qazvin. Between Qazvin and Mianeh the Democrats are running a limited service of three trains each way per week. At Takistan, though this place is in Democrat control, a gendarmerie [74—91]post of twelve men still remains. At Diwandarreh, some 30 miles further on the Tabriz road, there is no gendarmerie and there is a Russian military garrison of fifty men. Tehran. 6. The nearest Russian military check posts are now as follows : — (i) At Firuzkuh, 90 miles east of Tehran on the Tehran-Meshed road; (ii) At Garmsar railway junction, 50 miles east of Tehran; a (iii) At Baghat-i-Kalat, 25 miles west of Tehran on the Tehran-Kerej' road. There are Persian military check posts on all roads leading into Tehran. On the two roads mentioned above they are situated at Jajerud bridge, 17 miles east, and Caravansarai Sangi, 15 miles west, of Tehran respectively. Khamseh {Zen)an). 7. The Persian Chief of the General Staff states that the guerrilla bands of his resistance movement are more than holding their own against; the rebel forces of the Democrats. The band under Zulfigari, operating in the Khamseh province, south of Zenjan, though forced to retire when the rebels brought into action some of the light tanks recently captured from the Persian garrison at Rezaieh, managed, nevertheless, to inflict casualties on the rebels, and succeeded in taking prisoner three Red Army soldiers dressed in civilian clothes. Bakhtiari. 8. Murteza Quli Khan has arrived in Tehran. He was received in audience by His Imperial Majesty The Shah. In conversation wdh His Majesty’s Ambas sador, he stated that, in Government circles, there was some intention of appointing a military governor for Bakhtiari. He also said that he was tired of these squabbles among the Khans and was retiring for a few weeks’ rest to his estates near Shush. Appointments. 9. —{i) Ali Soheili (F.O. 217—M.A. 283), according to a press report, has arrived in London to join the Persian Delegation to the U.N.O. (ii) Dr. Hejazi to be Chief of the Passport Department in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (iii) Muhsin Shabrukh to be Director of the 1st Political Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; (iv) Ahmad Mirfindiriski to be Third Secretary at the Persian Embassy in Moscow; (v) Dr. Ali Siasi has been re-elected Dean of Tehran University for a further period of three years, (vi) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3, paragraph 17 (i), the new Imam Jum’eh is a nephew of the deceased Imam Jum’eh, his father being full brother to Zahir-ul-Islam and to the deceased. Persian Army. 10. A proclamation has been made recalling to the colours conscripts of the solar year 1300 (1921). As a result of the incidents reported in paragraph 14 below, the Persian army infantry battalion at Hamadan has sent out detachments of one platoon to Awej, and one company, less one platoon, to Razan. Persian Gendarmerie. 11. A press report states that 47 out of 102 gendarmerie officers stationed in Azerbaijan have now arrived back in Tehran. Two hundred and sixty-three other ranks have also reported to headquarters. Russian Interests. 12. Majors Veniamine Malighine and Constantin Kassorine have arrived to take up their duties as Assistant Russian Military Attaches. With Colonel Razin, Colonel Ivanof and Lieutenant-Colonel Krachevsky, the Russian Military Attache’s staff now numbers five.13. The Russian Charge d’Affaires, M. Yakubof, has left. As at the time of the- ambassador’s departure no intimation was given either to the Persian Government or to his diplomatic colleagues. The Russian Embassy is now believed to be in the charge of the First Secretary. 14. Some days ago a Russian civilian styling himself the Consul at Qazvin (there is no Russian Consul at Qazvin), accompanied by two Russian officers, visited the villages of Razan and Awaj (54 and 75 miles respectively from Hamadan) and Hamadan. At the two first named places they contacted the ■| population and urged them to enlist in the Azerbaijan People’s Army. The officer commanding of the newly-arrived Persian army infantry battalion at Hamadan reports a rumour current in that town to the effect that Russian troops will soon arrive there. 15. Certain Assyrians who frequent the Russian Consulate at Kermanshah have stated that the Russian Consul has spoken to them of a scheme to establish a Christian State west of Lake Urumiyeh. Great importance is not attached to this statement. It has long been known that the Russians have been using Persian minorities to further their own ends and it may well be that, having promised the Kurds an autonomous Kurdistan and the Armenians a welcome to Soviet Armenia, the Russians may feel obliged to hold out-some bait for the Assyrians and Chaldeans of this area. In any case, in the light of past history, no Assyrian or Chaldean living in an enclave surrounded by Kurds could be regarded in insurance parlance as a first class life. American Interests. 16. Several Tehran papers publish the text of an official communique from the United States Embassy in Tehran, denying allegations recently made in certain sections of the Tehran press that the United States Government has opposed any steps taken by the Persian Government to lay their complaint before the U.N.O. These allegations, the communique states, are completely untrue. It is the opinion of the United States Government that every member of the U.N.O. must be free to make its own decision as to whether or not it is necessary to draw the attention of the U.N.O. to any of its problems. No direct or indirect action has been taken by the United States Government to exercise any influence*in the decision taken by the Persian Government in connexion with the current problem.

Qawam-us-Saltaneh has not yet formed his cabinet and does not in a hurry to do so. Having been elected only by the narrowest majority he realizes that it will not be easy for him to ohoose a cabinet which is acceptable to the Shah, the Russians and those lukewarm supporters who only voted for him because they did not approve of the policy of the extreme Right which was to vote for Mutamin-ul-Mulk (who had already announced his unwillingness to take office) merely in order to register a defeat for Qav/am-^us-Saltaneh. Qawanv-us^Saltaneh meanwhile is despatching current business and watching how relations with Russia develop. after instructing Soheili in London to ask Yishinsky what bo means by direct negotiations. That Persia’s appeal is still on the books of U.N.O. is not. due t© Qawam’s efforts but he is probably glad to have this second string to his bow should the Russians prove unaccommodating in their demands. It is not clear where these direct negotiations will take place. Soheili, who has recently joined the Persian delegation in London, may be selected as more acceptable to the Russians than Taqizadeh. There are rumours that instructions to negotiate are being sent to the timcrous Ahi, Persian ambassador in Moscow. A Reuter message, for which at present there is no confirmation, states that a delegation of eight Persians will proceed to Moscow. The only course so fax not suggested is that Qawam should negotiate with the Russian Embassy in Tehran and this for the good reason that after the unannounced departure of both the Ambassador and Charg6 d’Affaires the official now in charge seems to be a First Secretary. Tomorrow, he might also make his unobtrusive exit and Russian diplomacy be carried on through the medium of the embassy gatekeeper. INTERNAL SECURITY. * Isfahan A series of strikes in the textile mills has occurred recently. It lasted for about ton days. The ostensible reason was a demand for a 20^ increase in wages but there is little justification for this demand as prices, if still high, have not risen again lately(x) The Tudeh party was certainly at the bottom of it but a local politician who has evolved a novel system of graft probably had a hand in the game. He stages a strike at one or more of the mills and then intimidates the mill owners into paying him handsomely to call it off. As he has influence with both owners and workers he has been able to effect this by securing for the workers some unimportant concessions which cost the owners but little. Pars. 3* According to reports from consular sources, uneasiness still prevails among the Qashgai and Mamassani at the turn of events in the ^Torth of Persia (see IntiSumy: No*3 para 9) and they rxe trying to elicit advice from the British consulate as to the action which the tribes of Pars should take in the event of a puppet Russian government coming into power in Tehran. (X) in ISFAHAN /Hamadan-2- k ^.dan, (ref.para 14 of last Int: Slimy:) H.M.Consul, Kermanshah, who visited Ramadan recently, reports that there seem to be no good grounds for believing that Russian troops will soon occupy that place* The Persian Army detachments at Razan and AweJ have established road check posts where vehicles are examined for suspicious travellers and arms. Kerman shah. 5* H.M. Consul reports that Tudeh activity is on the increase and tha/t -the rival parties are melting away. The achievement of their immediate objects in Azerbaijan by the Democrats, the paramount influence of the Tudah/Democrnts in Gdlan, hazanderan, G-urgan and, to a slightly less extent, in Khorasan, and the departure of British troops from Kermanshah would account for this. The Court. 6* PriffiP Ghulam Reza Pahlevi, the third son of the late Reza Shah (by his second Queen, Malikeh Turan, daughter of Majd-ua-Saltaneh and granddaughter of Haji Majd-ud-Dowleh) arrived by air from America on 28th January. Some weeks previously, in conversation with the B.M.A., H.I.M.The Shah disclosed the foot that he had been expelled from Priceton. Communications. ■ 7 * Exceptionally heavy falls of snow have been reported froc. nofijrly all parts of Persia and all roads to the North of Tehran remained blocked for 2 or 3 days. Railway traffic to the South was not seriously interrupted. The Ministry of Roads and Communications have failed to continue the arrangements for snow cleft.ro.noe on the passes on the main routes which were in force while the roads were under British military maintenance. ° # A Press communique states that the Soviet officials working on the railway lines Tehran - Mianeh, Tehran - Shahrud and Tehran - Bandar Shah have been recalled and the operation of these sections is being handed back to the Iranian State Railway. This, no doubt, is a concession made by the Russians to shew their satisfaction at the assumption of the premiership by their candidate Qawan-us-Saltaneh. In point of fact, it means little^to the Persian Government since the line from Qazvin to Mianeh is in complete control by the Democra.ts and the remaining sections entirely under Tudeh management. With the assistance of certain railway officials previously interned by the allies and now reinstated in their appointments Tudeh influence is said to be spreading rapidly along the Southern section as far as Durud and even Andimishk. 9* The Persian Government has been invited to send a delegate to the forthcoming Telecommunications meeting in Cairo at which representatives of the Middle East countries concerned will discuss ways and means to maintain the telephone and telegraph net work hitherto operated by the British Military authorities. Civil Aviation. On 22nd January an aeroplane belonging to the Persian Aero Club took off from Tehran and did not return. Other aeroplanes were despatched in search of it but no traces of it were found till, on the 27 th January, a report was received that the plane had landed at BINAB, some 5 kilometres S.E. of ZEN JAN. The pilot is now in Zenjan. thought that he may have joined the Democrat forces. /Polish Interests.w QLISH IMTSR5STS. ^ The la.st transport conveying Polish refugees from Ahwaz to the Lebanon left on 30th January.

Persian Affairs. Political. QAWAM-US-SALTANEH informed the Oriental Counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassy that he intends to go to Moscow himself but only for a short time.” either to introduce his delegation and leave them to their discussions or, at the end of the discussions, to sign any agreement reached. Qawam-us-Saltaneh would not appear to realise that getting into the bear s den is easier than getting out and that, once in Moscow, apart from the physical difficulties of air travel, the Russians will certainly try to keep him there and maintain pressure upon him, as their nominee and chief hope, to extract from the Persian delegation as many of their demands as possible. Such were thought to be : (i) an oil con cession; (ii) the cancellation of the recent law to postpone the Majlis elections; (iii) the recognition of the Azerbaijan National Government; (iv) a general amnesty of all Democrats, Kurds, &amp;c., who took part in the recent independence movement. There is a real danger that Qawam, realising the storm which would arise, not only in Persia but in the U.N.O., from acceding to such demands, may conclude a secret agreement with the Russians. In the meanwhile broadcasts from Delhi and Angora, to the effect that Qawam intended to recognise officially the Azerbaijan National Government, and to grant the Russians enlarged con cessions for fisheries in the Caspian and a concession for oil in Azerbaijan, have elicited a firm and indignant denial by the Persian Government. In an interview with Reuter’s correspondent in Tehran on the 9th February, Qawam is reported as having said : (i) that he would form his Cabinet within a few days; (ii) that he did not propose to invite any Tudeh or Democrat members to join it; (iii) that he had not as yet taken any decision about going to Moscow; (iv) that he did not propose to recognise the Azerbaijan National Government as the Persian Con stitution did not permit of such a step; (v) that the new elections could not be held at present because of the recently passed law which prohibited the holding of the elections as long as foreign troops were on Persian soil. There is no doubt that Qawam is in a quandary. He is naturally cautions. Being a Persian, he has the Persian’s natural aversion to coming to a decision. He has probably made contradictory promises to his supporters and to his erstwhile opponents in order to win their support and now sees these promises coming home to roost. His majority in the Majlis, originally of one. is no longer safely predictable at even that low figure. He knows that the Security Council have announced their intention of keeping an eye on the progress of any negotiations which the Persians may conduct directly with the Russians. Finally, there is the strong temptation to avoid any action and to sit and wait, ticking off on his calendar the bare twenty days which remain before the 2nd March. If, by that date, the Russians have withdrawn, he will have succeeded in freeing Persian soil from Russian military domination without having committed his Government to any concessions. If, by that date. Russian troops are still in Persia, he has always the Security Council of U.N.O. to fall back on. There will he many, apart* from Persians, who in this particular problem will see wisdom in a policy of “ wait and see.” The Majlis. 2. In political circles there is much discussion concerning the interval between the end of the present Majlis on the 12th March and the new elections which, according to a recently passed law, cannot be held till all foreign troops have left Persia. Qawam-us-Sultaneh may present his Cabinet and programmeto the Majlis and, on receiving a vote of confidence, that Cabinet would continue to govern the country between the dissolution of the present Majlis and the election of the next. Again, he might, though this is improbable, contrive to delay the presentation of his Cabinet till the dissolution and, under khose circumstances, he would continue to direct Persia’s affairs single-handed. A third possibility is the prolongation of the life of the present Majlis by special enactment. A fourth possibility is the repeal of the recent law for postponement^ of the elections. Yet a fifth course has found an advocate in Dr. Musaddiq. He proposes that, as Tehran itself is not occupied by foreign troops, the elections for the Tehran Deputies for the next Majlis should be held on the original and not the postponed date and that, when elected, these Deputies (to be increased by a special law from twelve to thirty), by virtue of Article 6 of the Constitution, should direct the affairs of the country. 3. According to Persian law an official against whom an indictment is pending cannot continue to serve in a Government appointment until the case is concluded.^ It will be recalled that some two years ago an indictment was made -against Ali Soheili, the then Prime Minister, and Tadayyun, the then Minister of Interior, for having illegally interfered in and having derived pecuniary benefit from the Majlis elections. Dr. Musaddiq, in a Majlis session of the 11th November. 1945, asked that speedy action be taken to conclude these two cases Apart from this, little more has been heard of the matter and it was thought that, as usually happens in Persia, the cases would fizzle out. Recent!v, however, on hearing that Soheili had been instructed to approach M. Vyshinski in London to learn what he meant by the phrase “direct negotiations,” Dr. Musaddiq went to the Ministry of Justice and demanded a report on the progress of the case against Soheili and an assurance to the effect that it had not been dropped. Dr Musaddiq does not like Soheili but, in this instance, his motives were probably not those of revenge but arose from his crusade against public dishonesty. Interned Security. Azerbaijan. 4. As the result of a recent visit to Senneh by His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah some interesting news has been received from him and also from other sources concerning the relations between the Kurds and Democrats. A reference to this subject was made in paragraph 19 of Intelligence Summary No. 50 of 1945 and paragraph 4 of Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current). The first issue seems to be that of a Kurdish refusal to admit Democrat officials into the zone they claim as Kurdistan, Mahabad being one of the places mentioned. The second dispute concerns the degree of control which the Democrats shall exercise over the foundation of an autonomous Kurdistan. Ghazi Muhammad of Mahabad was summoned to Tabriz and instructed to form a local Government under Democrat superintendence. This he refused to do, saying that he had direct relations with the Russians and that, according to his instructions from them, Kurdistan was to be independent of and not subordinate to Azerbaijan. To this the Democrats are reported to have at first demurred but finally agreed. (Indeed, without Russian armed support it would be impossible for' them to dictate terms to the Kurds.) Ghazi Muhammad is now reported to have assumed at Mahabad the Presidency of the “ Kurdish Republic,” to have appointed Haji Baba Sheikh as his “Prime Minister ” and to have hoisted a flag of his own design. The third difference of opinion is that of the proposed boundary between Azerbaijan and the “ Kurdistan Republic.” His Majesty’s Consul reports that the Kurdish area is from Miandoab to Sardasht, but other sources report (with what seems to be more probability) that the Kurds are claiming Maku, Khoi, Shahpur, Rizaieh to the west of the lake and Miandoab and Maragheh to the east of it. Kurdistan. 5. His Majesty’s Consul, Kermanshah. reports that Hama Rashid, whose escape from residence forcee in Kirkuk and whose entry into Persia was reported in paragraph 7 of Intelligence Summary No. 1, after satisfying the Russians of his bona fides, was presented by them with a sword of honour and a medal and was appointed commander-in-chief of the Kurdish forces in Mahabad. His personal following is estimated at ISO mounted men. One of his Begzadehs has returned to Panjwin and has made his peace with the Iraqi authorities. His wife is said to be under Iraqi surveillance in Daru Khan.[74—1891 b 2 6. Mulla Mustafa Barzani does not appear to enjoy the full confidence of the Russians, who doubt his complete loyalty to their cause. His followers, billeted, as previously reported, on the villages around Rezaieh and Nagadeh, are said to be in a miserable plight and that many of those not under sentence of death by the Iraqi authorities may endeavour to return to Iraq in the spring. 7. Movement by Democrat troops south of Saqqiz (reported from sources in Iraq but not in this summary) appear to be unconfirmed. According to General Humayuni, the Persian G.O.C. at Senneh. the southernmost limit of their activities is the line Sardasht-Baneh-Saqqiz-Tikab. The G.O.C. expressed himself as confident of his ability to deal with the situation unless Ghazi Muhammad, Hama Rashid and Mulla Mustafa were to combine for a southward movement, in which case the situation might become serious. Bakhtiari. 8. No settlement has as yet been reached in the dispute between the Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani families concerning the governorship of Bakhtiari. According to Saifpur Fatemi, the Deputy for Najafabad and the brother of Muteza Quli Khan’s unpopular henchman Misbah Fatemi, the latest proposal is that an addi tional governor, co-equal with Murteza Quli Khan, and four vice-governors be appointed, of whom one would be Abul Qasim Khan. According to Saifpur Fatemi, Murteza Quli Khan would prefer to resign rather than accept this arrangement. Mekran. 9. Thiee privately-owned lorries were held up by three armed Baluch robbers on the 4th February on the Zahidan—Meshed road, 36 miles north of Zahidan. The drivers were relieved of their cash. The gendarmerie, as usual, failed to make contact with the robbers, who fled towards the Perso-Afghan frontier. Persian Gendarmerie. 10. Colonel Schwarzkopf, the American adviser to the gendarmerie, com plains that he is making little headway in his efforts to improve the force. A recent order placing the gendarmerie under the orders of the army for operational purposes during the present crisis has, according to Colonel Schwarzkopf, been interpreted by the latter as giving them a right to interfere in his dispositions and to take a number of his men for duties which should properly be an army responsibility. He has not yet succeeded in establishing a separate court to deal with offences committed by his personnel and complains that, owing to lack of evidence or interference, he can never secure a conviction by the army tribunals of any gendarmerie offender. Until his officers are not placed on a separate cadre from the army, he can neither secure the promotion of those whom he considers fit nor the dismissal of the incompetent. He admits that while he has achieved something in the improvement of the pay, clothing and rations of the gendarmerie (and these improvements are noticeable more in Tehran than in the provinces), he has made no headway in eliminating dishonesty and peculation. Persian Navy. 11. For the past four years little or no mention has been made in these Intelligence Summaries of the almost non-existent Persian navy. Now that the re-establishment of this force is under discussion between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Persian Government, a short note on the present position (included as an appendix to this summary) may not be inopportune. A 'fypointments. 12.—(i) Muzaffar Firuz, the editor of Rad-i-Imruz, has been appointed Political Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister and Director-General of the Department of Propaganda. A personality note on this indi vidual will be published in the next Intelligence Summary. (ii) An unconfirmed press report states that, as Persia has decided to renew diplomatic relations with Italy, Fathullah Pakravan, Amir-i-Arfa (F.O. 169, M.A. 208), has been appointed Persian Ambassador at Rome.mmmammk 4 British Interests — Disposals. 13. Some time ago the Persian State Railways asked the British Military Authorities whether they could purchase certain items of rolling-stock, consisting of passenger coaches, goods wagons, refrigerator vans and portable cranes The price fixed by the British Military Authorities was £156,200. The Persian State Railways are also anxious to buy a sawmill at a cost of £40,000, and some second hand lorries for £7.000. As rials are unacceptable to the British Military Authorities, the Persian State Railways have asked for Cabinet sanction to borrow the sterling amount from the Persian National Bank.

When the Russians withdrew their troops from Qaleh MurMieh aero drome on the night of the 18th-19th September. 1945. they left behind some twenty-five civilian personnel of Intourist to operate their air services to Tabriz, Meshed and Moscow. These have now been transferred to Mehrabad aerodrome and Qaleh Murgheh is in undisputed possession of the Persian Air Force. The Russian personnel at Mehrabad are said to number about fifty and to be com posed of men and women. They also maintain a meteorological station. 15. M. Ali Abdul Oglu Iliev, the First Secretary of the Russian Embassy, referred to in paragraph 1 of last Intelligence Summary, has now been appointed charge d aftaires in place of M. Yakubof, who left some time ago. 16. The Russians have now made another gesture of goodwill towards the eisian Cjovemment, presumably to mark their pleasure at the appointment of Qawam-us-Saltaneh as Prime Minister. They have permitted some officials of the Ministry of Agriculture to visit Azerbaijan to study the locust situation. Most Persians would say that in Azerbaijan the pest which requires eradication is not the locust. Polish Interests (see paragraph 11 of last Intelligence Summary). 17. Thirty-four Polish Jew refugees still remain in Tehran They refuse to recognise the Warsaw Government or its legation in Tehran. On account of the 1 ales tine problem the Lebanon Government refused them entry into Lebanon along with the other refugees. Owing to their attitude to the Warsaw Govern- men and to the Russians, their continued presence in Tehran was embarrassino- fortunately the Government of India has now agreed to admit them Appendix.

A committee in the Ministry of War (there is no separate Ministry of Marine) lias examined the question but no decision was reached. The Ministry of War. which is concerned solely with the financial aspect, has no money available and no separate budgetary allotment, money needed for the navy or for the air force being met from the general Ministry of War budget of 100 million tomans which, originally l&amp;id down as the maximum by Dr. Millspaugh, still remains the official figure. I he Ministry is believed to favour (i) compensation by His Majesty’s Government but not replacement for Nos. 1 and 2 in the above list, (ii) a cash payment for the hire of Nos. 3. 4 and 5, and cash compensation for No. 6, but not the gift of any new vessels by His Majesty’s Government in lieu of line oi compensation, (iii) the temporary laying up of vessels 3. 4 and 5 under caretaker crews, (iv) limiting the operational functions of the navy to river police, pieventive duties, and maintenance of liaison between army detachments on the coast where land communications are difficult. 1 he General k&gt;tafl, wnile realising the difficulty of collecting the now widely-scattered personnel of the navy in a period of less than two months, is in favour of accepting (if offcred--and, as vet the offer has not been disclosed to them) replacements for Nos. 1 and 2 and'the offer of three H.D.M Ls., (a) in plm e of the cannibalised gunboat, and (ft) as hire for the use of the remaining three. It also wishes to acquire some motor launches for river police and pre ventive duties. His Imperial Majesty the Shah, with that total disregard for considerations of finance which characterises his discussion of plans for his army, and air force, is reported to favour the General Staff's plan plus the acquisition of a “ cruiser or two,” which he imagines may be available free of charge from captured ex-enemy sources.THIS[75—43] _ T ft THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT M PERSIA. SECRET. March 5, 1946. Section 1. [E 1962/318/34] Copy No. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 7, Secret, for the Period \lth February to YJth February, 1946 .—(Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 57 of \§th February; Received- 5th March.) Persian A /fairs. Political. Qawam-us-Saltaneh has made up his Cabinet. Their names and portfolios are as follows :— (i) Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior : Ahmed Qawam (Qawam-us-Saltaneh), (F.O. 183—M.A. 295). (ii) Minister without Portfolio : Dr. Ahmed Matin Daftari (F.O. 131— M.A. 168). (iii) Minister of Justice : Anushirwan Sepahbudi (F.O. 205—M.A. 282). (iv) Minister of War: General Ahmedi (F.O. 16—M.A. 23). (v) Minister of Finance: Murteza Quli Bavat (Saham-us-Sultan) (F.O. 47—M.A. 65). (vi) Minister of Roads and Communications: General Muhammad Hussein Firuz (F.O. 72—M.A. 94). (vii) Minister of Industry and Mines : Sipehr Muwarrikh-ud-Dowleh. (viii) Minister of Education : Bahar, Malik-ush-Shuara. (ix) Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones : Saham-ud-din Ghaffari (Zuka-ed-Dowleh) (F.O. 75—M.A. 97). (x) Minister of Health : Dr. Manuchihr Iqbal (F.O. 94). The retention by Qawam of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in his own hands is understandable when he is to lead the deputation to Moscow. More sinister is his retention of the Ministry of the Interior, in view of the forthcoming elections. (ii)—a Minister of Justice and Prime Minister under Reza Shah; was interned by the Allies; (iii) —was Minister for Foreign Affairs in Sadr’s Cabinet; (iv) —represents a sop to the extreme Right, without whose support Qawam’s slender Majlis majority of one would be speedily transformed into a minority. The Russians are believed to have opposed this appoint ment very strongly; (v) —an ex-Prime Minister, needs no introduction as an outstanding dolt; (vi)—was a member of the last Cabinet, but resigned. He made no secret of his views that appeasement of the Russians was the only practicable policy. The family estates are in Azerbaijan; (vii)—is chiefly renowned for being a political go-between, posing as being in the innermost councils of both the British and Russian Embassies. Is mistrusted by the Shah, as by everybody, but is used by him as a sort of political pimp; (viii)—is a notable poet who has recently sold himself to the Tudeh: (ix)—belongs to a family suspected of having contacts with the Japanese Legation in Tehran during the war; (x) —has mixed little in politics and has some good ideas of improving Persia’s health services. He has not much energy and will cut little ice in this Cabinet. Is a brother of Khosro Iqbal the ex-internee editor of Iran-i-Ma. The above were presented to H.I.M. The Shah on the 14th February and were due to be presented to the Majlis on the 17th February. 2. The composition of two Persian delegations to Moscow has been announced. The first, a political mission, consisting of the following :—Leader : Qawam-us-Saltaneh. Members : Dr. Matin Daftari. General Firuz. Hamid Seyyah (F.O. 292). Dr. Reza Zadeh Shafaq. Jawad Ameri (F.O. 18). Deputy Durri (re-elected by Tudeh pressure after his creden tials had been rejected). The second delegation, styled a commercial delegation, comprises the following :— Ali Muhammad Oveisi (F.O. 164) : Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Industry and Mines. Nikpur : President of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. Salman Assadi : (F.O. 33). The Journal de Tehran announces that the missions will remain in Moscow for two weeks. A large Russian aeroplane arrived in Tehran on the 11th February. 3. The Prime Minister has issued a proclamation cancelling the Military Governor’s orders prohibiting political and party meetings. The portion of the orders pertaining to the press will remain in force until further notice. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 4. A consular report states that conscripts of the 20 to 29 age groups arc being called up for service in the Azerbaijan Peoples’ Army. The National Government claim that, so far, 15,000 men have volunteered, but it is doubtful whether anyone has done so. The Prime Minister of Azerbaijan has admitted that there is no money with which to clothe, feed and pay them. The Russians are believed to have helped by providing cloth and buttons for officers’ uniforms. 5. More rifles of Persian army pattern have been seen in rebel hands whose numbers show them to belong to the consignment sold by the Persian army to the Russians. A “Democrat ' from Marand disclosed the fact that he could get no ammunition for his Russian pattern rifle from the Russians as they had given strict instructions that no rifles or ammunition of Russian pattern were to be distributed to the rebels, though B.R.N.O. rifles of Persian army pattern and Persian army ammunition could be supplied in large quantities. 6. T he economic position of the National Government shows no improvement. Only moderate success is being achieved in the collection of income tax. Trade and banking are at a standstill. A drastic cut has been made in wages which has resulted in a slight drop in prices. Factories are either idle or have been taken over by the Democrats and are working with reduced hands. 7. Azerbaijan has adopted Moscow time (3 hours ahead of G.M.T.) instead of Tehran time (3^ hours ahead of G.M.T.). 8. The scattered bands of “ Fidais ” are said to be proving an embarrass ment to the People’s army, who are now trying to organise them into units and bring them under effective control. 9. The National Government is now submitting all British, Indian and American films to a strict censorship. No doubt political more than moral lapses are searched for, but it is obvious that this censorship could be used for commercial discrimination in favour of Russian films. 10. The news of the dfeath of Ghulam Yahya, Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Defence of the National Government, reported in Intelligence Summary No. 1, paragraph 6, has now been denied. Khorasan. 11. Major Pikholin, Russian Publicity Officer, recently visited Turbat-i- Haideri in order to open a branch of the Tudeh party there. He is reported to have had an altercation with the local commander of the gendarmerie who had recently expelled from the town a number of hooligans who were the Tudeh’s main supporters. Fars. 12. Merdi Farrukh, the Governor-General, has been summoned to Tehran for consultations. It is thought that he will not return to Shiraz as opposition to[75—43] b 2 ■■■■■ ■CMBBBka At) I / / him has increased from many influential quarters. A consular report states that Reza Hekmat, Sardar Fakhir (F.O. 86-M.A. 112) claims to have arranged his recall and is trying to secure his own appointment as Governor-General. Bakhtiari. 13. An unconfirmed report states that Qawam-us-Saltaneh has dismissed Murteza Quli Khan from his governorship of Bakhtiari. A pfointments. 14. —(i) General Farajullah Aghovli (F.O. 23-M.A. 6) to be Chief of the General Staff vice General Hasan Arfa. (ii) General Purzand to be General Officer Commanding 3rd (Hamadan) Division—the new division which is forming at Hamadan and which is earmarked for the reoccupation of Azerbaijan. Both of the above named were interned by the Allies during the war. General Arfa’s distrust of Qawam-us-Saltaneh, his hatred of the Russians and their agents the Tudeh, and his implacable hostility to the Democrat rebels have long marked him out as the first victim should Qawam-us-Saltaneh come into power. His strong stand against appeasement and the energetic measures which he took to safeguard the capital against any Russian inspired rising have earned him the respect of nearly all patriotic Persians. He has, however, certain inherent defects of character which have alienated the sympathies of many who would have other wise given him their support. He is excitable, overbearing and harsh and adopts a tone of moral superiority which exasperates his fellow countrymen. He is a good hater and relentlessly pursues all whom he imagines to be the friends of his predecessor and rival, General Razmara. To strengthen his position (as he vainly thought) he has intrigued with politicians and newspaper editors. He has founded a party in the army. He has a spy-hunting mania and daily discovers plots against the realm and even against the life of the Shah himself. His departure is a loss, for, despite his inverted patriotism which sometimes showed itself in xenophobia, he has co-operated wholeheartedly with the British, believing that their policy and Persia's were one and the same, i.e., the continued existence of Persia as an independent State.

A press communique states that Mr. J. H. Le Rougetel, C.M.G., M.C., has been appointed as His Majesty’s Ambassador in Tehran to succeed Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.B., C.M.G., C.I.E. ' 17. On the 12th February a clash occurred between a patrol of Indian troops and a patrol of Persian military The Indian patrol opened fire upon a Persian watchman whom they mistook for a wire thief. When a Persian military patrol arrived upon the scene they were mistaken for reinforcements for the thieves and were fired upon. Two Persian soldiers were wounded. A merican Interests. 18. Complaints have been received of the indiscipline of crews of American ships at Abadan and Khorramshahr, and also of smuggling of arms by them. This is on a small scale but nevertheless affects adversely the security of the area. The arms are of two kinds : (a) war souvenir rifles of Japanese pattern held under permit and (h) rifles illegally bought in Far Eastern ports. Both are sold by seamen to the local inhabitants. Russian Interests. 19. A new Russian vice-consul, Mr. Nicolas Denisov, has been appointed to Isfahan. His previous post has been in Pahlevi and he is reported to have served in Kabul for four years prior to that. The staff of the Russian Consulate inIsfahan thus consists of Mr. Krutchov as consul, Messrs. Marchenko Denisov and Sagov, vice-consuls, an interpreter and a secretary. 20. Owing to the high standard of security prevailing in the Russian- occupied parts of Persia, information as to Russian strengths, dispositions and troop movements has been difficult to obtain. There is, unfortunately, no British consular post between Tabriz and Meshed. The Persian general staff does not seem to have any system of obtaining military information or of checking such vague rumours as reach its ears. This is unfortunate at a time when it is important to know what preparations, if any, the Russians have made to remove their troops from Persia by the 2nd March. Such informatian as has been gleaned amounts, in some instances, to little more than indications of a possible withdrawal. From Meshed a consular report states that the Russians have abandoned their plan of opening a large hospital and have terminated the lease of the premises and discharged the staff locally engaged. They are stated to be about to return to the Persian army the official residence of the General Officer Commanding Khorasan Division which has been in their occupation ever since the entry into Persia of their troops. From Miandoab comes a report that the Russians are disposing of their surplus stocks of potatoes and forage. In Tabriz they are reported as having told all contractors to settle their accounts by the 2nd March. The Minister of Finance of the Azerbaijan National Govern ment informed the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia that his Government intended to form a large army before the 2nd March, “ when the Russians were due to leave.” Some reductions have been noticed in the military posts which the Russians maintained to guard the railway, that at Garmsar Junction having been reduced from 200 to 50. No Russian military are now to be seen on the road between Garmsar and Semnan and the garrison at this place is said to have been reduced to one cavalry regiment. The source of information which has proved to be the most accurate hitherto, i.e., observation of arrivals and departures at Tehran railway station, no longer furnishes a guide since it is anticipated that the thiee main concentrations of Russian troops in Rhorasan, Mazanderan and Azerbaijan will return to Russia via Askhabad, Pahlevi and Julfa respectively.

APPENDIX “ A.” Personality Note.—Muzaffar Firuz. A Qajar, and inclined to call himself ” Prince.” Born about 1910, son of Ausiat-ud-Dauleh and, hence, grandson of the late Farman Farma. Educated at Harrow and Cambridge. Speaks English and French fluently. A man of excitable and nervous disposition who gives full rein to his feelings and ideas in the newspaper Ra'd-i-Imruz, which he owns and edits. All his political activities directed to one end—opposition to the present Shah, whom he wishes to see removed as vengeance for the death of his father at the hands of the Shah s father, the late Reza Shah. His hostility has recently been sharpened fact that his wife s relation, Ismet-ul-Muluk, one of the wives of Reza Shah was recently evicted from the Palace on a charge of improper behaviour He was at one time employed in the Persian Legation at Washington whence, it is believed, he was removed at the request of the United States Government tor abuse of diplomatic bag privileges. It was Muzaffar Eiruz who went to Palestine and brought from there Seyyid /ia s first manifesto. He remained an ardent supporter of Seyyid Zia until May 1^45, when he broke with him. He says the breach was caused by Seyyid Zia s becoming more and more dictatorial; 1 Seyyid Zia’s version is that they had to part because Muzaffar Firuz would not abandon his newspaper campaign against the Shah, and Seyyid Zia felt that it was impossible to fmht the Russians and the Shah at the same time. After this Muzaffar Firuz tried to compose his differences with the Tudeh, meaning, he says, to break them later but he failed, and towards the end of 1945 he became one of the chief supporters of the candidature of Qavam-es-Saltaneh to the premiership. As a reward for this, the Qavam, when he became Premier, appointed Muzaffar Firuz “ Political Under-Secretary ” (an office apparently created for the purpose) and Director of Propaganda (February 1946).# 5 Muzaftar Firuz is clever and can write well, but he is rash, unbalanced, dishonest, untruthful and malicious. He would probably sacrifice anything to bring about the downfall of the Shah. The Shah is aware of this, and will find it difficult to work with a Prime Minister who could make such an appointment. APPENDIX “ B.” Personality Note.—Ahmad ’Ali Sipihr (Muvarrikhu d-Dauleh). W as l nder-Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry at the beginning of 1944. In February of 1944 he was Acting Minister of Commerce and Industry for a short while after the resignation of Nakh’i. He was removed from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in the summer of 1944 and remained without an appointment until August 1945, when he was appointed Head of the Caspian Fisheries, a post which he still occupies. In June 1942 he was a member of the Hizb-i-Milliun, and was also mixed up in another German plot involving Qavam-as-Saltaneh and the old Husain Ali Qaraquzlu (not M. Ala’s brother-in-law, the son of the late Regent). C.I.C.l. distrusted him intensely. The opinion of His Majesty’s Ambassador was that he was obstructive to us, an incorrigible intriguer, and very corrupt even by Persian standards. He was assumed to be working for the Russians, with whom, as Head of the Fisheries, he is in close touch. In 1945 he was an active member of a committee to put Qavam-us-Saltaneh in as Prime Minister. Now that they have succeeded he confidently expects the Commerce and Industry portfolio.[75—73] 0 -v_ r ij* C \ SECRET' (fee/' /Y4°/^4 Sfcti '/T fV / vlc j tCA THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

Copy No. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 8, Secret for ^e Period \%th-2Ath February, 1946.— {Communicated in Tehran despatch No. bU of 26^ February; Received %th March.) Persian Affairs. Political. Qawam-us-Saltaneh presented his Cabinet to the Majlis on the 17th Febiuaiv. In his speech he said that he was not presenting his programme as yet because a the programmes of the numerous Cabinets which had come into powei during e past few years had remained but empty words. The present crisis called tor deeds not words. In his opinion Persia’s foreign policy required the restoration of good relations with the Soviet Government, balance and the maintenance o friendship based on mutual respect between Persia and the three Great lowers Regarding internal policy the most pressing needs were the superannuation ot worthless officials, the lowering of the cost of living and a vigorous campaign against hoarders and profiteers. By not presenting his programme Qawam has skilfully avoided the risk of a defeat which might have resulted from the lequest for a vote of confidence on it. By leaving the next morning for Moscow he adroitly escaped from a possible peremptory summons to present his programme. While the Left is jubilant at Qawam’s tactical success and his swallowing of the Moscow bait, the Right are despondent, cowed and bewildered. With the inclusion m the Cabinet of so many Ministers of pronounced pro-Russian views they fear that their country will be sold in Moscow without even the meagre consolation ot hearing the terms of sale till it is too late. With the recent changes in the General Staff and gendarmerie and General Firuz’s machinations in the Ministry of the Interior they fear that their chances of re-election to the next Majlis are slender indeed. Many people think that Qawam will not dare to agiee to Russian demands openly but that he will include them in an agreement which will remain secret till the next Majlis meets, when, packed with a substantial Tudeh majority, it will proceed to ratify such an agreement. Those few of the Right who, after the shock of Qawam’s victory, still retain their senses, are talking of measures to outwit him. Some are in favour of presenting a petition to the Shah expressing their disagreement over Qawam’s policy and asking the Shah to dismiss him (as he has the constitutional right to do when the life of the Majlis expires on the 12th March) and appoint another Cabinet composed of stable elements who would govern the country during the interim between the 12th March and the election of the next Majlis. A few hotheads are prating of a coup d'Ptat which would seize power, throw out the Qawam and govern the country by a military Cabinet till the next Majlis is formed. 2. ‘ (Reference paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary.)—General Firuz did not. after all accompany Qawam-us-Saltaneh to Moscow. It is believed, on fairly reliable evidence, that he was left behind to keep an eye on things in general and on the Ministry of the Interior in particular, the importance of which crows daily in view of the forthcoming elections. Hasan Pir Nazar, an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was included in the delegation. Oveisi excused himself from the commercial delegation on grounds of ill health. The Persian press has devoted much space to accounts of the cordial reception given to the Persian delegations, to Qawam-us-Salteneh’s meeting with Generalissimo Stalin and to the expression of hopes that much of lasting benefit to Persia both in the political and economic fields will result from the visit. Internal Security. Khorasan. 3. A consular report states that a fracas occurred on the 9th February between Tudeh and anti-Tudeh elements over the distribution of ballot papers for the elections for provincial councils. Three lorry loads of Russian soldiersarmed with tommy guns were seen moving about the streets of Meshed. I he Russians subsequently gave out that they were preventing any possible breach of the peace at a time when feelings were 1 running high but, as the Persian police and military were present in sufficient strength to cope with any outbreak, it seems more probable that the Russians were using their soldiery (not for the first time) to overawe the Tudeh’s opponents. The Governor-General wisely postponed the elections nominally for one week but it is generally believed that they will not be held till after the 2nd March. 4. Beyond the indications given in paragraph 20 of last Intelligence Summary the consul-general reports that there are no further signs of the Russians withdrawing by the 2nd March. Azerbaijan. 5. A press report states that a Kurdish chief (whose name is given by the Persian General Staff as Umar Khan Shakkak) has captured an official who had been despatched to Rezaieh by the Azerbaijan National Government as governor and that the town of Rezaieh, though claimed by the Democrats as lying within autonomous Azerbaijan, is still in Kurdish hands Bakhtiari. 6. On the 21st February the Minister for War confirmed that Qawam-us- Saltaneh had dismissed Murteza Quli Khan from his governorship of the Bakhtiari (Intelligence Summary No. 7, paragraph 13 refers). A press report stated that Varasteh, Governor-General of Isfahan, was now in charge of Bakhtiari affairs in addition to his other duties but the Minister of War stated that, pending a settlement of the question of a future governorship representing both Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani interests, he had instructed the General Officer Commanding Isfahan Division to send a military officer to keep an eye on things in Bakhtiari and prevent any disturbances which might follow the sudden with drawal of Murteza Quli Khan’s strong hand. Communications. 7. M. Husein Nafisi. director-general of the Persian State Railway, informed the British military attach^ on the 21st February and again on the 23rd February that, as vet, the Russians had not in fact handed back the three sections of the Persian State Railway under their operational control. (Intelli gence Summary No. 5, paragraph 8, refers.) ,4 ppointments — dismissals. g—(i) Qawam-us-Saltaneh has dismissed Sartip Itimad Muqaddam, the Military Governor of Tehran. A Colonel Muzaffari has been appointed in his place. Little is known of this officer save that he has commanded a brigade in Gurgan and has been recently employed in the military tribunal department of the Military Governor’s office. (ii) On Qawam-us-Saltaneh’s instructions General Muhammad Husein Firuz, Minister of Roads and Communications and officiating Minister of the Interior during Qawam’s absence in Moscow, has dismissed Sartip Khosro Panah, chief of the' gendarmerie. Neither Colonel Schwarzkopf, the American adviser to the o-endarmerie. nor the Shah, to whom normally all appointments of senior army officers are referred, was consulted. No successor to Khosro Panah has yet been appointed. It is a significant fact that the Minister of the Interior arranges the election of his nominees to the Majlis largely through the medium of the chief of the gendarmerie. Personalities. 9. A personality note on General Aghevli, the new Chief of the General Staff, is given as an appendix to this summary. British Interests. 10. Major-General R. A. Savory, C.B, D.S.O., M.C., General Officer Commanding Persia and Iraq Force, visited Tehran from the 21st to 23rd February to bid an official farewell to the Persian Government on the occasion of the evacuation of Persia by British troops and to thank the various Ministries concerned for their co-operation during the war. He was received inaudience by His Imperial Majesty the Shah and had interviews with the Minister for War, C.G.S., and Minister of Roads and Communications, also officiating as Minister of the Interior. At a press conference, a communique giving some details of the evacuation was given to newspaper representatives. Russian Interests. 11. Baku Radio, in their Persian transmission on the 24th February, announced that the Soviet Government proposes to appoint as Ambassador to Persia Mr. Sadtchikof, at present Russian Ambassador in Belgrade.

At the Majlis session of the 21st February a Deputy for Birjand demanded immediate and energetic action by the Persian Government in respect of an alleged diversion of the Helmand river by the Afghans which, he claimed, would result in the ruin of the peasantry of Seistan. The Deputy stated that during the past nine months Afghan navvies, varying in numbers from 24,000 to 36.000, had been employed under foreign engineers in constructing a oanal from 5-9 metres in depth, 59 metres in width and 210 kilom. in length, As long ago as July 1945 requests were made by the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty’s Embassy and by the local officials to His Majesty’s Consulate General, Meshed, for historical information concerning agreements and awards previously made in this long-standing dispute. While studiously refraining from taking sides in the controversy, His Majesty’s Embassy made available to His Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, copies of the MacMahon Arbitral Award of 1905.

Entered the service of the gendarmerie in 1911 and was trained under the Swedish officers of this force. Promoted Sartip (brigadier) in 1922, he was employed as Chief of Staff to the Western army in Hamadan. Military Governor of Gilan 1925. Military Governor of Gurgan 1927. Military Governor of Khuzistan 1922 to 1931, during which period he showed administrative ability in establishing the new regime of Reza Shah. Accused of partiality towards the tribes, he was placed on the retired list in 1931. Appointed director-general of the Registration and Civil Census Department in 1932. Relieved of this appointment in 1934. Remained unemployed till the departure of Reza Shah. Director of Recruiting October 1941. Chief of the gendarmerie December 1941. Promoted Sarlashgar (major-general) June 1942. Military Governor of Tehran, in addition to his duties as chief of the gendarmerie, February 1943. Fell out with Colonel Schwarzkopf, the American adviser to the gendarmerie over the question of executive powers, main taining that these should be vested in him as chief and that Colonel Schwarzkopf’s functions were only those of an adviser. Relinquished the post. Head of the Conscription Department vice Sartip Khosro Panah June 1943. He was a leading member of the committee of the German fifth column, the Melliun party. Is reported by a Persian fellow-conspirator to have provided the motor car which conveyed Franz Mayr to Isfahan and to have assisted actively in his escape when the latter was wanted by the Persian police. Was on the British list for arrest but was not arrested because of his eminent position and reputation for integrity. As, however, his name appeared on the Russian list, he was included in the joint list and arrested in July 1943. Was taken by the Russians to Resht for special interrogation and is reported to have been made much of by them. Shortly afterwards they announced that they had nothing against him and gave publicity to the fact that his further internment was due solely to British insistence. It was suspected at the time that the Russians had come to some understanding with Aghevli and had promised him release or, at any rate, the cessation of their insistence on his continued internment, in exchange for some quid pro quo.Interned till the end of the war with Japan. Head of the Military Tribunals Department November 1945. Appointed Chief of the General Staff in February 1946 when Qawam-us-Saltaneh became Prime Minister. Aghevli has the reputation of being honest, efficient, energetic, conscientious and a devout Moslem. (Colonel Schwarzkopf, however, does not consider him honest as he detected a tyre swindle in which General Aghevli was implicated.) General Fraser, who knew him intimately over a long period, and whose opinion regarding him has subsequently been confirmed by many Persians, thought that Aghevli was patriotic and that any action taken by him in connexion with the fifth column was neither common treachery nor out of a desire to sell his country to the Germans for whom he had no special liking. Like many other intelligent, patriotic but misguided Persians he saw in a German victory a chance to free his country from its unenviable and century-old position between the upper mill stone of Russian aggression and the nether millstone of British imperialism.[75—146] With th ^ n, '*’rnsnts — J ” J 'rjro-- - m * ' 1 ■ &gt;nrir,, ' r| ^— c//c a VI c/c^c- Qf f ...jor V !

Political. The 2nd March has gone, but the Russians have not. For some months past there have been many who thought that they might not go. Ever since Qawam- us-Saltaneh went to Moscow many more thought that they would not go. When only a few days remained before the due date everybody realised that the) could not go. The general feeling is that of blank despair. Some resentment is telt at the Russian announcement to the effect that Qawam-us-Saltaneh was informed as long ago as the 25th February that the evacuation would be limited to the “ comparativelv tranquil areas of Semnan, Shahrud and Meshed, and that Russian troops would remain in the remaining parts of their zone till the “situation had clarified.’’ It was too much to hope that the Qawam would keep his Government or the Majlis informed of the progress of the negotiations, but they feel that information of such importance should have been communicated. Adding insult to injury, the Qawam’s political private secretary, Muzaffar Firuz, having 1 repeatedly warned the populace to listen-in to a forthcoming broadcast of the greatest importance, announced “ as a piece of good news for the Persian nation ’’ the beginning of the evacuation by the Russians of the three towns mentioned above. ... , • • i e 2. In Persian circles, official or unofficial, in Tehran, nothing is known ot the progress of the negotiations or even of their scope, since Qawam was allowed to go to Moscow without any limiting directive from the Majlis. From a certain source, however, it is learnt that the Russians appear to have made three demands, viz. : (a) the recognition of the complete independence or autonomy of Azerbaijan,. (b) the maintenance of Russian troops in North Persia after the 2nd March, (c) an oil concession. The same source reports the Qawam as saying that he had no authority to agree to these demands. A rumoured willingness on the part of the Russians to waive (b) if (c) were granted will deceive but few, since the need for protecting their newly-acquired oil interests in Persia would serve them as an adequate pretext for bringing back their troops on to Persian soil. 3. It is believed that the possibility of the Shah using his constitutional powers to dismiss the Qawam during the interval between this Majlis and the next has not escaped the Russians and that they may take measures to forestall this by bringing pressure to bear upon the Shah either to secure his submission or possibly his abdication. Such measures would suit the book of such as Muzaffar Firuz and his uncle, Muhammad Husein Firuz, who bear an implacable hatred towards the Pahlevi dynasty. 4. A general purge of all Ministries is being carried out. Those with anti- Tudeh sympathies are, in general, being dismissed, but members of Seyyid Zia’s Iradeh-i Milli party, in particular, are singled out for expulsion. Internal Security. GHan. 5. A band of armed democrat insurgents marched during the past week from Astara on Pahlevi. According to the latest information, based on press reports, after having taken Karganrud and Shifarud, they are now about 30 kilom. from Pahlevi. The band is said to number about 600, to be armed with rifles, machine guns and a field gun and to have started their march from Russian Astara.Khorasan. 6. According to an estimate by His \Eajesty s Consul-General, Meshed, the Russian military garrison in that town numbers about 1,500. In Sabzevar and Kuehan there are small detachments of about fifty men. In Shahrud the numbers are larger and show a recent increase, but this is probably due to concentration at this railhead of troops recently evacuated from Semnan. A zerbaijan. 7. The Azerbaijan National Government passed two new laws on the 20th February. The first provided for the division among the peasants of all lands which Thad become State lands since the accession of Reza Shah. The second law dealt with the confiscation of all movable and immovable property of all persons who had left Azerbaijan and who were carrying on propaganda against or fighting against the Azerbaijan National Government. 8. The fact that calling-up notices for the Azerbaijan People’s Army were posted in Rezaieh indicates that the Azerbaijan National (Government does not recognise Kurdish claims to this place. 9. The Minister of Finance in the Azerbaijan National Government has called upon the local manager of the A.I.O.C. to pay to his Government all excise duties hitherto paid to the Central Government, d he manager has replied that, as these dues were previously paid over in Tehran, he is not in a position to comply with the order. The duties amount to rials 13‘50 per 4-gallon tin of petrol and rials 9 90 per 4-gallon tin of kerosene. The National Government’s d'esire to lay their hands on this considerable source of revenue has long been known 10. According to a consular report, a Russian cavalry regiment with horse- drawn A.T. guns, A.A. guns and transport was seen at Tabriz railway station presumably about to entrain for Julfa and Russia. Apart from this move and the move of some Red Army women soldiers, the number and size of Russian military garrisons in Azerbaijan remain at much the same figure as before. 11. On the 2nd March about 8.000 people attended a mass meeting of the Democrat party. This was followed by a military parade in which some 2,000 “regulars” and 3.000 “ volunteers of the People’s Army took part. The “ regulars” had new uniforms and equipment and were armed with rifles, three or four machine guns per company being also seen. The “ volunteers,” of whom about 100 were cavalry, in addition to their rifles, had two or three field guns. A women’s detachment also took part. A ppointments, Dismissals. 12. —(a) Military.

Personalities —corrigendum. 13. Reference appendix to last Intelligence Summary : the date of birth of General Aghevli should read 1885.Persian Civil A viation. 14. It is reliably reported that an agreement has been reached between the various Ministries concerned (principally War and Posts, Telegraphs and Tele phones) for the establishment of an autonomous Department of Civil Aviation, responsible directly to the Council of Ministers. The Ministries concerned will over to the new Department all their assets, including budgetary credits, ^Wering their civil aviation activities, including signals, meteorology and the operation of the State Air Line. The director of the new Department will be Ahmad Shafiq, the Shah’s brother-in-law. He is a licensed pilot with consider able aviation experience in Egypt, and has already shown more appreciation ot the needs and deficiencies of Persian civil aviation than any of the many and often conflicting authorities who have hitherto mishandled it. The policy with regard to air lines seems to be to encourage foreign air lines to come to lehran, to reserve the Tehran-Bagdad route for the State Air Line and to allow private enterprise to operate internal services, possibly under a system of licensing certain organisations to run over specified routes. There are two possible private concerns in the field, the Iranian Airways, of which the moving spirit is G. H. Ebthaj, the late mayor, and a sort of co-operative enterprise of pilots which is believed to have the backing of the Shah and Shafiq himself, but which has not yet come into the open. It is fairly reliably reported that Iranian Airways, who have been enquiring for British Dominies, have also made an agreement with the Americans (probably T.W.A.) covering technical and financial management in exchange for a 10 per cent, share participation.

Personality Note on Sartip {Brigadier) Abdullah Hidayet. Born about 1902. Nephew of Ghulam Reza Kemal-Hidayet, Mukhbir-ud- Douleh, nephew of Nasr-ul-Mulk (M.A. 140) and of Fahim-ud-Douleh (M.A.141), and thus comes of a family wdiich has usually been pro-British. Sartip Abdullah Hidayet is not markedly so, but is friendly. He is intelligent and cultured. Was trained at the French Leole de Guerre and also at Fontainebleau. He is a well- qualified, serious and patriotic officer, more Staff Officer than Commander. Has a good reputation for honesty, but became the object of suspicion to many on account of his close friendship with General Razmara. He speaks good French and some English. His recent appointments include Head of the 3rd Bureau General Staff: 1941. Director of the Staff College : 1941. Deputy Chief of the General Staff: 1942.

Secret, for the Pei tod Mh March to 10th March, {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 75 of \2th March ; Received 23/c? March.) Persian Affairs. Political. Qawam-us-Saltaneh returned by air from Moscow on the 10th March. Information from a certain source in Moscow regarding the demands made on Persia by Russia was given in paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary. The London Evening News, on what authority it is unknown, stated that the demands totalled six and comprised :— (i) A treaty of alliance between Persia and the L.S.S.R. (ii) Recognition by the Central Grovernment of the Autonomous GoveinmeiiL of Azerbaijan. (iii) Co-ordination of Persia’s foreign policy with that of the L.S&gt;.R (iv) An oil concession. (v) The organisation, location and employment of the armed forces of autonomous Azerbaijan to be under Russian military direction. (vi) The Persian Government to invite the Russian military forces to remain in Persia pending acceptance of the above. In conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d Aflaires in Moscow, Qawam- us-Saltaneh referred only to two demands, namely, for an oil concession and recognition of an autonomous Azerbaijan. In reply to the first, Qawam states that he informed the Russians that he had no authority to grant this, a recent law making even the discussion of oil concessions an offence punishable by impeachment. He was equallv powerless to recognise an autonomous Azerbaijan, as he had been forbidden to* discuss this by the Majlis. When the Russians suggested the election of a Majlis which would repeal the law against discussion of oil concessions, Qawam replied that a law had recently been passed prohibiting the holding of elections for the next Majlis until such time as all foreign troops had left Persia. Qawam also informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that he sent a written protest to the Soviet Government on the 4th March when he learnt of their decision to maintain their troops in l ersia. In the course of the conversations the Russians, in addition to advancing the usual reasons foi main taining their troops in Persia, such as the danger to the Sowet Lnion aiising from Fascist and Imperialist elements so close to its borders, the vulnerability of the Baku oilfields, &amp;c., introduced a novel argument by referring to past history and claiming that Persia’s demands at the Peace Conference oi Paris had included Baku, Turkestan [sic] and Armenia. Hakimi had been a member of the Persian delegation. Hakimi had recently been Prime Minister. Hakimi had appealed to U.N.O. Ergo Persia’s claims to Russian territory still stood and Persia’s hostility to the U.S.S.R. was still in evidence. The 1921 treaty was. of course, also brought in to the discussions. Qawam said that no agreement had been reached, even on commercial matters. A communique was published at the conclusion of the visit which stated that the conversations had been carried on in a friendly atmosphere and that, after the new Soviet Ambassador had arrived in Tehran, the two Governments would renew their efforts to place their relations on a friendly basis. That the Qawam has come back empty-handed causes no surprise. Most people will be relieved if subsequent events confirm that he told the Russians what he avows he told them. The Majlis. 2. In yesterday’s session of the Majlis Deputy Dr. Musaddiq made a long speech in protest against the continued presence of Russian troops on Persian soil after the 2nd March. The main points of his speech were that the presenceof such troops constituted a direct violation of the Tripartite Pact and that the Prime Minister had gone to Moscow to discuss other problems, not the evacuation of Persia, for which clear provision had been made in the Tripartite Pact. He expressed surprise that no official news had been sent from Moscow by Qawam, even though he had been informed of the Soviet Government’s decision on the 26th February, especially in view of the few remaining days of the life of the present Majlis. A significant point in Musaddiq’s speech was that he said that because the Prime Minister s journey to Moscow had lasted longer than was first envisaged and because no news had been received from him the Persian nation and people were anxious. Their anxiety was based on the memories they had of the journeys made by the leaders of small nations to the capitals of large and powerful nations during the war which had just ended. He sincerely hoped that such anxiety was groundless. 3. There have been several rowdy demonstrations outside the Majlis and in other parts of the town staged by the Tudeh against any move by the Deputies to prolong the life of the present Majlis beyond the 12th March. The police and gendarmerie, though present at the scene of these demonstrations, took no action to maintain order and several casualties occurred, mostly in the ranks of the anti-Tudeh. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 4. A consular report states that the country round Rezaieh seems to be completely under Kurdish control. The Kurds have formed a Government in which Ghazi Muhammad of Mehabad holds the post of Prime Minister, with Omar Khan Shakkak as Minister for War, Rashid Beg Herki as commander-in chief and Zero Agha as Commandant of Gendarmerie. Kurdish patrols in Rezaieh wear arm-bands inscribed “ Jumhuriet-i-Kurdistan ” (Kurdistan Republic). 5. Conscription for the Azerbaijan People’s Army is arousing bitter discontent in Tabriz. Few of those called up are responding voluntarily and “ Fidais ” (literally “ devotees,” but here signifying volunteers in the national cause) are arresting young men on the streets. A notice has been published that all those called up who do not report before the 26th February will be tried and punished as deserters. 6. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General reports that the place of the mounted units which recently left Tabriz for Russia (see paragraph 10 of last Intelligence Summary) has been taken by mechanised units of at least equal strength. A number of tanks (sheeted) were seen at Tabriz railway station being unloaded from a train which had come from Julfa, and subsequently a column of 40 lorry loads of Russian troops, 20 tanks and 21 armoured cars was seen moving down the road to Zen]an, presumably to reinforce the Democrat troops in action against the Zulfiqari partisans in that area. The Deputy Minister for War in the Azerbaijan National Government is reported as having said that he could not continue to hold Zenjan without further support by the Russians. The Prime Minister of Azerbaijan also alluded in a speech on the 3rd March to the impending arrival of Russian military equipment for the People’s Army. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General reports two other Russian columns as on the move, viz., one on the 3rd March towards Miandoab (rumoured as being bound for Khaneh, on the Iraq frontier) and the other towards Maragheh. A number of Caucasian and Russian officers in civilian clothes are now believed to be attached to the People’s Army. An American consular source at Tabriz also reports the move of a column towards Khoi, to the west of Lake Urumiyeh. The total Russian evacuations up to date, according to His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General, are the cavalry unit of 800 men (alluded to above and in paragraph 10 of last Intelligence Summary) with A.T. guns and A.A. guns and, on the 8th March, a further force of 2,000 Russian cavalry, twelve light field guns and five tractor-drawn heavy guns. There are unconfirmed reports of more arrivals of infantry and tanks by rail from Russia on the 7th March. 7. An unruly mob of Democrats attacked and damaged the P.R.B. premises in Tabriz, where a loud-speaker was installed. The popularity of British radio programmes and news had long been a cause of anxiety to the Azerbaijan National Government, who would prefer its subjects to listen only to the Moscow brand of truth 8. The Azerbaijan National Government recently announced that part of the Province of Gilan as far as Shiffarud (also spelt Shafarud—about 65 miles south of Astara and 20 miles north-west of Pahlevi) had been amalgamated toAzerbaijan and placed under the govemorate of Ardebil (paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary mentioned a move of Democrat forces down this coast from Astara towards Pahlevi). Kurdistan. 9. The Minister for War informed the British Military Attache on the MOth March that, in view of the deterioration in the situation in Kurdistan and ^f the vulnerable positions of the garrisons of one battalion each at Sardasht and Baneh, he proposed to withdraw these to Saqqiz, which he regarded as a better defensive position. The garrison at Merivan would remain. Khorasan. 10. A reliable report, based on personal reconnaissance by a British consular official, states that the Russian military garrison of 2,500 of all arms evacuated Meshed on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th March, moving to Askhabad. Most of the Persian military buildings and barracks have been handed back by the Russians. Very few Russian military personnel were seen in the town. The American Assistant Military Attache, who recently travelled as far as Shahrud and back, saw a cavalry regiment in process of evacuating this place and another on its way from Semnan to Shahrud. While the Tehran-Meshed road from Semnan to Meshed is therefore almost clear of Russian troops by now, the Russians still maintain a small military post of about twenty-five men at Garmsar Railway Junction, which is only 50 miles east of Tehran. About a week ago this post stopped and prevented the further advance towards Semnan of a small force of Persian military composed of two battalions of infantry, a battery of artillery and some tanks. After some days’ delay permission to proceed was given by the Russians, but the General Staff judged it unwise to advance with the Russians in their rear and possible rearguards of evacuating Russian units in front in the neighbourhood of Semnan. Gendarmerie reinforcements for Semnan, Damghan and Shahrud were similarly stopped at Garmsar and their officers disarmed and detained in Russian military custody for twenty-four hours.

Persian A ffairs. Political. The Qawam, both in the Majlis and outside of it, has been guarded in his statements concerning his mission to Moscow. In conversation with His Majesty s Ambassador he said that he had found the Russians ‘ cold and arrogant and adamant in their refusal to evacuate Azerbaijan. He had offered them a provincial council in Azerbaijan and the selection of a Governor-General, a mayor, a chief of police and a director of education in accordance with the wishes of this council. The Russians refused this offer and insisted on the retention of Pishevari as “Prime Minister” of an autonomous Azerbaijan. During the discussions on the question of an oil concession the Qawam had been surprised when M. Molotov expressed his readiness to negotiate on the basis of the proposal already made by Bayat.” Qawam was puzzled by this allusion as neither he nor anyone else was aware that Bayat, when Prime Minister, had made any such proposal. Subsequent enquiries showed, however, that Bayat had, without informing his Cabinet colleagues, proposed the exploitation of Azer baijan oil by a Persian company in which the Persian Government and Soviet Government were to hold 51 per cent, and 49 per cent, of the shares respectively. Qawam, as already reported in last week’s Intelligence Summary, replied that he was not empowered to discuss the question of an oil concession. Qawam doubt less feels there is now no other course open to Persia but to renew her appeal to U.N.O., but he is perturbed by a recent threat by the Russians that if Persia appeals it will go ill with her. He feels therefore that it would be less provocative of Russian resentment if a third party were to raise the issue in U.N.O. The Russian refusal to evacuate their troops and the recent arrivals of armoured forces so near to the capital as Zenjan and Kerej have caused something akin to panic in Tehran. The Majlis. 2. On the 11th March a crowd of Tudeh supporters several thousand strong gathered near the Majlis with the object of preventing the attendance of members lest they should enact legislation to secure the prolongation of the life of the present Majlis. So successful was this intimidation that only six Deputies were present, thus preventing a session for lack of a quorum. On the 12th March some seventy Deputies attended and a secret session was held at which the Prime Minister gave an account of his mission to Moscow. He is reported to have said that his mission was warmly received, that he hoped that the discussions would he continued through diplomatic channels after the arrival of the new Soviet Ambassador in Tehran and that the Persian nation was held in warm regard by the Soviet Government. (In conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires in Moscow, the Qawam had described the Russians as “cold and arrogant. ’) He admitted that his mission had been unsuccessful in that he had not been able to agree to Russian demands for an oil concession, or^for the recognition of an autonomous Azerbaijan, and that he had been unable to secure the evacuation of Persia by Soviet troops. The Majlis, at the same session, elected a presidential body to deal with the administrative affairs of the Majlis during the interim period between the dissolution of the fourteenth Majlis and the election of the fifteenth. As the fourteenth Majlis dissolved without having passed a one-twelfth Budget Bill to cover the period of Isfand (the 20th Eebruary-20th March), the Ministry of Finance propose to submit the Bill to the Cabinet for approval and then to begin payments. Apart from the Deputies themselves, no one will shed a tear at the passing of the fourteenth Majlis, which must surely go down to o [76—31] Bhistory as one of the most inefficient, idle and corrupt which has ever been elected. It has passed some forty laws, most of them consisting of one-twelfth Budget Bills. The remainder either remain a dead letter for lack of the administrative energy required to carry them out or are so badly drafted as to be incapable of being put into effect. Some sixty Bills remained on the agenda. 3. On the 11th March an editor of a weekly paper, by name Ahmad Kasrawi, and his munshi were being examined in the Ministry of Justice on a charge of having printed some articles derogatory to Islam. Two Isfahanis burst into the court-room and!, drawing revolvers, shot Kasrawi and his munshi dead. Though the press of the Left and Right have both accused each other of instigating the deed, it is, in fact, believed to have no political significance what ever and to be merely an example of that religious fanaticism of which Persians are still capable, despite the outward indifference to religion so prevalent through out the country to-day. Russian Military Dispositions in North Persia. 4. In order to present a clearer picture, information concerning Russian evacuation, troop movements and strengths is condensed under the above heading instead of reporting it under the title of “ Internal Security under provincial sub-headings. It must be realised that a tight control of all movement and an exceptionally high degree of security prevail in the Russian-occupied zone of Persia. Even if access to an area is obtained, little is seen as all Russian military installations and dumps are cordoned off. Troop movements nearly always take place by night. The local officials are Democrats. The local populace is too scared of the Russians to impart any information. Hence it is almost impossible to get definite confirmation of any information. The following brief summary is based on the best information available. The situation is described from west to east. Azerbaijan, northern portion. A previous estimate put the Russian strength in the area between the Turkish frontier and Lake Urumiyeh at one cavalry and one infantry division. These have now been reinforced by 2,800 cavalry with one or two batteries of A.A. guns and one or two batteries of anti-tank guns which recently left Tabriz and are now reported to have arrived at Maku via Khoi. A report on subsequent moves of artillery to Maku mentions an unspecified number of guns, but states they were sufficiently heavy to be forced to by-pass all bridges en route. Azerbaijan, southern portion. The infantry regiment with an unknown number ot artillery amd engineers previously in the area between the Iraqi frontier and Lake Urumiyeh has now been reinforced by the arrival of two columns (strength unspecified but probably not exceeding a battalion each) from Tabriz. A source of unknown reliability, states that further reinforcements to these columns consisted of twenty-eight tanks, and an unspecified number of guns on lorries and lorried infantry. Azerbaijan, eastern portion. Tanks and guns are reported as arriving by rail at Tabriz from Russia and a con sular servant estimated that, at Tabriz Railway Station andat the Russian barracks on the 13th March, the number of vehicles were : tanks 7; 10-ton lorries full of stores, 6 ; field artillery on lorries, 27; and on the 15th March, a further 50 lorries full of troops and stores, and 25 field guns. The Russian garrison at Tabriz itself probably does not number more than a 1,000 men, as bands of Iidais and Democrat rebel troops, stiffened with Russian officers and soldiers, exist or are coming into being and are sufficient to maintain order in the town and! surrounding districts. Khamseh Province (Zenjan). A force of 800 lorried infantry, 20 armoured cars and 20 tanks, which had arrived in Tabriz from Russia by rail during the first week of March, left for Zen ian a few days later. Subsequent additions to this force are reported! but without confirmation, as consisting of a column of vehicles, including 70 tanks, on the 10th March. Kerej (25 miles west of Tehran). Here the Russian military garrison of one battalion is believed on good grounds to have been increased to two. (Statistics of bread and meat rationdeliveries would indicate an overall strength of 2,500.) Arrivals of Sherman- size tanks to the number of twelve and approximately twelve guns by rail by night from Zenjan, are reliably reported. The crews travelled with their vehicles and guns, but the infantry arrived by road in lorries. Gilan, Mazanderan, Gurgan. No information has been received lately, but there is no reason to believe that any changes in strength or locations have been made. I he last estimate of the total strength was about 5,000 men. Garmsar Railway Junction (50 miles east of Tehran). Here there is a small Russian control post of twenty-five men. According to the Minister for War, it is visited daily by a patrol of one company from Bun-i-Kuh, some 15 miles away, where there is a battalion of infantry. ihe brigade headquarters and the remainder of the brigade are said by the Minister for War to be located at Firuzkuh, 90 miles east of Tehran. Semnan. This place would appear to be clear of troops. Shahrud. The latest information showed that a cavalry regiment was in process of evacuating this place and proceeding, presumably, to Kuchan by the direct route avoiding Meshed. A strong check post, however, has been left behind to deny access to Gurgan by the Shahrud-Gurgan road. Meshed. The latest estimate, from consular sources, puts the number of Russian soldiery at 500 cavalry and two guns. The main Russian garrison of 2,500 of all arms, which evacuated Meshed on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of March, has not proceeded any further than Kuchan where they are encamped. Internal Security. Fars. 5. No Governor-General has yet been appointed to succeed Mehdi Farrukh. A consular report states that 300 gendarmes nave been sent to Tehran. Dashti. 6. According to the two Bushire Deputies Khalil Dashti and Safawi, two local sheikhs, by name Abdul Rasul and Nasir Chakutai, sons of Sheikh Husein, have established themselves in Baluk by means of a small tribal force supplied by Nasir Khan Qashgai, who is said to be anxious to extend his influence into this area. Kuh-Gilu. 7. The principal Kuh Gilu chiefs left for Behbehan during the month. They were all to some extent disappointed at the amount of cloth, tea and sugar rations they received in spite of the fact that the Governor-General and the Finance Director stetched a point and gave them their allotment not only for the month of Bahman but also for Esfand, which does not come to an end till the 21st March. The reason for their dissatisfaction is curious. The statistics on which the issue of rations is being made at present are the figures which the tribe gave to the census department in Reza Shah’s time when conscripts were being taken from them: The total then shown was 25,000. The tribe now say that of course that was an absurd under-estimate and should have been 85,000 at least. The question whether to issue rations for the excess of 85,000 over 25,000 has been referred to Tehran and no reply has yet arrived. Practically none of the rations ever reached the individuals of the tribe. The bulk issues were sold at a profit in Ahwaz and Khorramshahr by the tribal chiefs concerned. One result of this has been internal difficulties from certain disappointed “ Kedkhudas.” [76—31] b 2Mekran. 8. A British consular officer on tour was recently informed by a local Bakshdar that Tudeh agents had become more active in his area and that two of them had visited a place called Bahu Kalat near the Indian frontier some 50 miles north of Gwatar. Kurdistan. 9. In paragraph 9 of last Intelligence Summary mention was made of the ^ Persian General Staffs intention to withdraw the garrisons of Sardasht and Baneh to Saqqiz in view of their vulnerable positions. Before this could be done, it is now learned, a force of some 500 Mangur Kurds attacked the garrison of Sardasht and inflicted about a dozen casualties. The Minister of War also informed the British Military Attache that a force of Kurdish horsemen, said to number 1,000, composed of Herki and Shakkah Kurds, had assembled at Miandoab. He feared that they would be supported by Russian troops and would move south to attack, firstly, the Afshar tribal partisans in the Tikab and Shahin Dej areas and, secondly, the Persian army garrison at Saqqiz. Success in this area would, he rightly observed, have disastrous consequences for the Persian Government as it would open up to Democrat penetration the Bijar and Hamadan areas and, indeed, the rest of Persia. General Amanuallah Jehanbani has hurriedly left for Semneh to examine the situation. A dministration. 10. According to a Government communique to the press the elections for provincial and district councils have been completed in the following towns : Isfahan, Senneh. Sari, Nishapur, Sabzavar, Turbat-i-Haidari, Qazvin, Shahrud, Shahi, Babul, Gurgan, Yezd, Gulpaigan, Kashan, Quchan, Bujnurd, Rafsinjan, Gunabad and Bam. A ppointments — Dismissals. H.—(i) Ghulam Hussein Muazzi, the Chief of the C.I.D. in Tehran, has been dismissed. (ii) Sarlashgar (Major-General) Fazlullah Zahidi to be Director of the Officers’ Club. (This general officer was interned by the British during the war. He was holding the appointment of General Officer Commanding Isfahan Division at the time of his arrest.) (iii) Ahmad Itibar (Itibar-ud-Dowleh) to be Governor-General of Vth Ustan (Kermanshah) vice Kalantari. (Itibar was Minister of Agriculture in Soheili's Cabinet of December 1943.) Persian Air Force. 12. A Hind aircraft of the Persian air force, piloted by a Lieutenant Jawad Zarineh with an n.c.o. mechanic as passenger, took off on the 10th March and did not return. A report from His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General, Tabriz, states that this machine subsequently forced-landed at Shibli some 20 miles south-east of Tabriz. The machine was damaged and the pilot was injured. His intention was to desert and join the Democrat forces in Azerbaijan. This is the second case of desertion with an aeroplane from the Persian air force. British Interests. 13. Colonel E. P. J. Ryan, representing the British Aircraft Manufacturers’ Corporation in the Middle East, visited Tehran during the week. The newspaper Iran quotes Colonel Ryan as having said that there was a great future for civil aviation in the Middle East. The newspaper Journal de Tehran came out with a less innocuous remark to the effect that Colonel Ryan had arrived to renew contacts with the friends which he had made during his four years' service on the General Staff of Paiforce. Belgian Interests. 14. Colonel (Aviateur) Victor Biver has arrived in Tehran to assume the appointment of Belgian Military Attache, vacant since the departure of Lieut.-Colonel Dothee in December 1944. This is Colonel Biver’s second tour of duty in Persia as he succeeded Colonel Alis Nordquist, a Swede, as head of a Belgian Air Mission in July 1934. His contract was renewed for a further period of two years in May 1936 but, on its termination, it was not renewed again and he left Persia in May 1938. He was not replaced.\ o A merican Interests. 15. The following officers have arrived iti Tehran to take np the appoint ment of Assistant American Military Attaches :— Captain Archibald B. Roosevelt (Junior). Captain Paul M. Moomaw (Junior). P.S.—Reference paragraph 4 above, a recent telegram from His Majesty’s Lcting Consul-General at Tabriz gives the following additional information r regarding Russian military movements in his area :— (i) Russian cavalry were seen moving from Maragheh towards Tabriz on the 12th March. This would be in accord with previous moves, which seem to have the object of concentrating their cavalry on the Turkish frontier and replacing them in the remaining parts of Azerbaijan by armoured forces; (ii) Twenty-four tanks, one armoured car and a convoy of lorries carrying troops and equipment were seen on the 13th March moving south from Maragheh to Miandoab. Some tanks had already arrived in Miandoab by the 12th March; (iii) There is some evidence to show that the Russian troops in Maraghch and Miandoab are fresh arrivals from Yugoslavia; (iv) The Russians are said to. be making a new road from Miandoab to Shahin Dej, 40 miles distant in a south-easterly direction. This would imply that recent troop movements in this area are designed for the reinforcement of Democrat or Kurdish rebels fighting against the Afshar tribal partisans in the neighbourhood of Shahin Dej and Tikab, and possibly later against the main Persian Army garrison at Saqqiz and not to threaten Iraq from the frontier at Khaneh where climatic conditions in the Kurdistan mountains for at least another month would hamper the resumption of Russian-aided operations by the Barzanis against the Iraqi Government.- vViin ^ of the , Cor-i^tafV of Stat« Un for PorciRn Affairs THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT dT/Cc LL'Ls&amp;kA- *&gt; r ^f.C 7 J&gt;?MAV 1946 PERSIA.

Political. AS the result of his refusal to accede to the Russian demands in Moscow, Qavam-us-Saltaneh s stock has risen. His subsequent decision to appeal to UNO has further enhanced his reputation, the more so since it was made in the face of the Russian threat to the effect that the lodging of the appeal would be considered by them as an unfriendly act on the part ol the Persian Govern ment His mercurial temperament does not permit the Persian to ha\e the same emotions for long. (As he himself puts it: “ In Persia puff once to light the fire, spit once to put it out.”) Already there are signs that he is thorough!} frightened at his own bravery of a few days ago. There is some evidence ol dissensions in the Cabinet on the question of the appeal and Qavam is even said to be considering the dismissal of General Firuz, Sepehr and Bahar, who have consistently advocated complete submission to Russia as the only wise policy for Jr^orsict 2. To the account of Qavam-us-Saltaneh’s negotiations in Moscow, given in paragraph 1 of last Intelligence Summary and paragraph 1 of Intelligence Summary No. 10, should be added the fact that he presented to the Soviet Govern ment a written claim for 2,000 million rials (about £lo million) on account of customs dues, payments due on a munitions agreement, cereals supplied, payments due to the railway administration and rial sellings credit for which had accrued to the Persian Government in gold and dollars in Moscow. 3. “In the interests of the country ’ and because of “ the suspicion aroused by his actions,” the Prime Minister on the 20th March ordered the arrest of Sayyid Zia-ud-Din Tabatabai, in accordance with article 5 of the Military Governorship Law, which says, “ Persons suspected of opposition to the consti tutional Government or public order and security may be arrested by the execu tive power. After arrest their interrogation will be begun and if during the interrogation suspicion is not entirely removed the suspect will remain under detention and will be handed over to the civil courts after the period of military governorship has ended. General Riazi, who has a well-deserved reputation foi veracity, admitted to the British military attache that the arrest of a patriot so outspoken in his denunciations of the Russians and so vigorous in his opposi tion to the Tudeh was “ to preserve a policy of balance and to smooth the feelings of the Russians, so ruffled by Qavam’s appeal to U.N.O. Muzaftar Firuz, who has an equally well-deserved reputation for mendacity, stated that tne arrest was protective. It is rumoured that a demand for Sayyid Zia’s arrest was made as soon as he arrived by M. Sadtchikof, the new Russian Ambassador. Motives of personal revenge may not be entirely lacking since Qavam-us-Saltaneh was one of those imprisoned by Sayyid Zia-ud-Din when he brought off his coup d’Ptat some twenty-five years ago. Though Qavam said in conversation with His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires that the arrest was deemed necessary in view of Sayyid Zia’s personal actions, that no further arrests of Sayyid Zia's adherents in his “ National Will” party were contemplated and that, in order to preserve order, arrests, if necessary, would be made without distinction between Tudeh and anti-Tudeh, there are good grounds for believing that orders- were actually issued for the arrest of the Deputies Ali Dashti and JelaLImami and 0 also of' General Hasan Arfa, the late Chief of the General Staff. It is believed that they all slipped away from Tehran in time, however, and have not yet been apprehended. Ali Dashti though, like Sayyid Zia, a strong opponent of the Tudeh and of Russia’s present policy and actions in Persia, was not a member of the “ National Will” party but was the leading personality in a party of his own making named Adalat (Justice). Jelal Imami was a close associate of [76—117]Sayyid Zia's. General Arfa's firm stand against Tudeli and Russian aggression had long ago marked him out as a target for their hatred. Sayyid Zia’s arrest has a twofold importance. Firstly, in that he was popularly supposed to be a tool of the British, his arrest is hailed by his opponents as a resounding defeat for his “ imperial masters.' Secondly, in that he typified resistance to Russia, his disappearance from the arena has dismayed his adherents and driven under ground any further movement to stand up against Russian threats and bullying. In consequence, some signs of panic have appeared and some of the more prudent merchants have already left the capital for destinations in the south. Pilgrimage to the holy places of Iraq has suddenly become popular, and a number of wealthy Persians have recently developed symptoms of diseases which can only be cured by a prolonged course of treatment in Palestine.

Russian Troop Movements. 7. \ ery little news has been received during the past week and there is little that can be added to the information given in paragraph 4 of last Intelli gence Summary. Northern Azerbaijan. The 2,800 cavalry reported as having arrived in the Maku area have been reinforced by a further 1,000 seen leaving Maragheh and passing through Tabriz. Taking the maximum strength of a Russian cavalry division as 5,000, the cavalry now in this area, therefore, account for practically all of the cavalry division which, for some time, has been believed to be located in Azerbaijan. The Turkish Consul at Rezaieh informed his ambassador in Tehran on the 19th March that he estimated the strength of the Russian forces in the area Maku-Baigiran- Qutur as 10,000. Tabriz. Tanks, guns and lorries continue to arrive in Tabriz by rail from Russia. The United States Consul observed sixty tanks in the Russian barracks area on the 17th March. His Majesty’s Consul, though unable to view the whole area, observed fifteen tanks and 120 lorries on the 18th March, and on the 20th March estimated the number of tanks in the same area as between forty and fifty, including ten heavy tanks. The number of lorries, he calculated, had increased to 300. Qazvin. By an error, no mention was made in last Intelligence Summary of the Russian garrison at this place which, according to an estimate by the American military attache, amounts to two battalions of infantry and two batteries of A.A. guns and two batteries of anti-tank guns. Camp Stalin, the very large camp constructed by the Americans about 2 miles out of Qazvin on the Hamadan road and which was recently sold by their Disposals Board to a local contractor, is still empty, and the Russian troops mentioned above are partly billeted in the town and partly encamped at a village some 7 miles out of Qazvin on the Resht road.Appointments. 8. (i) Seyyid Mehdi Fatemi, Imad-us-Saltaneh (F.O. 66; M.A. 92) to be Governor-General of Fars vice Mehdi Farrukh recalled. (ii) Mehdi Mashaikhi to be acting Mayor of Tehran vice Nariman resigned. (iii) Sarlashgar (Major-General) Razmara (F.O. 189; M.A. 243) to be attached to the General Staff. A press report, which is premature, if not untrue, states that the Persian Government propose to appoint Hasan Yusuq, Vusuq-ud-Dowleh (F.O. 230; M.A. 296), Ali Mansur, Mansur-ul-Mulk (F.O. 126; M.A. 164), and Hamid Sayyah (F.0. 202; M.A. 258) as ambassadors to London, Moscow and Brussels respectively. As long ago as September 1942 Qavam-us-Saltaneh, when Prime Minister, tried to get his brother, Yusuq, appointed to Angora, but nothing came of it, probably because Yusuq was too ill with cancer of the stomach to leave Berne where he has been living under medical treatment almost since the beginning of the war. Ali Mansur, an exceptionally able man who served for three years as Governor-General of Khorasan under Russian occupation, is known to be persona grata to the Russians. Hamid Sayyah is a fool who lias somehow managed to pass a long career in various diplomatic and ministerial posts. He speaks perfect Russian and has recently associated himself with the appeasement- mongers among the politicians. Persian Army. 9. A press report states that all but ten of the officers sent to Kerman by General Arfa, the late Chief of the General Staff, as suspected of complicity in the recent mutiny or of having Russian—Tudeh contacts, have been released from surveillance. A commission will sit to examine the evidence against the remaining ten. 10. Conscripts of the 1305 (1926) class have been called up. Those who belong to the 1295-1304 (1916-25) classes who were not called up when their class was due have now been called up. 11. Three battalions of infantry and two light tanks were sent from Tehran on the 19th March to Hamadan to reinforce the garrison there as it was feared that the Democrats might attempt to move south through Biiar on Hamadan.

Copy No. [E 3485/315/34] Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 13, Secret, for the period ^th March to 1th April, 1946.— (Communicated in 7 ehran despatch No. 107 of the %th April; Received 18M April.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE veil of secrecy which surrounded the actions of Qawam-us-Salteneh since his return from Moscow and the arrival of the new Russian Ambassador has been lifted and the period of speculation as to the nature of any agreement he might have been negotiating has come to an end with the publication on the 5th April of an official communique on the subject. It states that the conver sations which the Persian Prime Minister had begun in Moscow with the Soviet Government had been resumed in Tehran after the arrival of the new Russian Ambassador and had resulted on the 4th April in the following agreement, com plete accord having been achieved in all the problems :— “ (i) The Russian military forces will evacuate Persia in the space of a month and a half from the 24th March, 1946. “ (ii) The agreement to create a Russo-Persian oil company and the con ditions pertaining thereto will be proposed to the 15th Majlis after election within a period of seven months from the 24th March. “ (iii) Concerning Azerbaijan, this being a Persian internal question, peaceful agreements will be sought between the Persian Government and the populace of Azerbaijan to achieve reforms in accord with existing legislation and in a spirit of understanding of the people's point of view.” The Qawam's supporters claim for him a great victory on the grounds that he has secured the evacuation of Persia by Russian troops ; that he has not awarded the Russians any oil concession but has retained the right by the new Majlis to throw out the Bill should they wish to do so, and that by insisting on treating the Azerbaijan issue as a Persian domestic problem he has given the Russians no opportunity to interfere in its settlement. His critics maintain that his initial tactical error was in not insisting on evacuation as an essential preliminary to any talks on any subject and that, by linking the three subjects in the same agreement, he has bartered an undertaking from which it will be difficult for him or for *any Majlis to withdraw in return for an evacuation which, in any case, Russia was bound to carry out under a solemn treaty obligation or which she would have been forced, sooner or later, to carry out in the face of world opposition at U.N.O. Regarding the third clause, Qawam’s critics object that the moral if not material support which the Russians will continue to give to the Kurdish and Democrat armies will prevent the Persian Government from re-establishing their authority in this province and thus force the Persian Govern ment to conclude an agreement which will give Azerbaijan the autonomy which, at Russian instigation, it has hitherto claimed. These same critics also point out with dismay certain acts by Qawam which have effectively driven underground any further opposition to Russian aims by those who had formed a resistance front. Such are the arrest of Sayyid Zia-ud-Dine and, more recently, of his brother ; the suppression of practically every newspaper except those supported by the Russians; the continued pressure on the Minister for War to arrest General Arfa, the late Chief of the General Staff; the cessation of Government support for the Afshar and Zulfiqari partisans who are fighting the Democrat rebel forces; the dismissal of the Chief of Police. Zarrabi; the retention of the control of the gendarmerie in his own hands by the Prime Minister; the dismissal of many officials noted for their anti-Russian sympathies and the retention as his political private secretary of such an unprincipled scoundrel as Muzaffar Firuz. [76—154]Evacuation of Russian Troops. 2. With the exception of Azerbaijan and Khamseh (Zenjan) the general impression is one ot leisurely evacuation with concentrations at (i) the Russian frontier north of Meshed, (ii) the ports of Bandar Shah and Pahlevi to await the arrival of transport by land and sea respectively. More detailed information is given below. (a) Tehrar^Meshed.-^&amp;MmsM and Firuzkuh (on the old and new Khorasan roads respectively) are clear as is Semnan, except that a party of civilian engineers is still at work at their oil boring south of Semnan. Damghan is clear. Shahrud is clear but for a party of ten men now clothed as civilians under the guise of Iran-Sovtrans (Russian transport agency). Sabzevar and Nishapur are clear but some ten Russian military trucks were seen on the 28th March a.nd the 1st April transporting stores and broken down vehicles. About 150 Russian military per sonnel remain in Meshed to evacuate stores. The Persian General Officer Com manding in Meshed estimated on the 31st March that about half the Meshed garrison of 2,500 had actually crossed the Russian frontier at Bajgiran, the remainder being located at Quchan and beyond. At Dugai, 12 miles south of Quehan, the British Military Attache noticed twenty Russian lorries parked. (b) Tehran—Firuzkuh—Shahi-Sarn-Gurgan-Bandar Shah. — The Persian press announces the evacuation of Shahi and the commencement on the 27th March of the evacuation of Gurgan. It will probably take a month to complete the evacuation by sea from Bandar Shah of the forces now concentrated in that area. (c) Tehran-Kerej-Qazvin-Resht-Pahlevi. —Kerej is reported as clear and Qazvin also, except for a rear party disposing of hirings and evacuating stores. Evacuation by sea from Pahlevi is proceeding. (d) Qazvin-Takestan. —Takestan is reported as clear. Beyond this point the Democrat rebel forces have established road pickets and no Russian evacua tion is believed to have begun. (e) Azerbaijan and Khamseh. —In these two provinces there are no signs of evacuation but rather of fresh arrivals of a formation at least amounting to an armoured corps. The dispositions appear to be : — (i) A cavalry concentration near the Turkish frontier at Maku of about 4,000 with probably tw 7 o batteries of heavy artillery and some infantry —total strength estimated by Turkish Consul at Rezaieh as 10,000. (ii) About half the total of the estimated armoured corps is believed to be in the region south of Lake Urmiyeh. Miandoab, Mahabad and on the Iraq frontier at Khaneh in general, supporting the two “ fronts,” i.e., Kurdish Republican army versus Persian army around Saqqiz and Sardasht, and Democrat rebels versus Afshar partisans around Shahin Dej. (iii) About a quarter of the corps is believed to be in Tabriz. (iv) About a quarter is believed to be in and around Zenjan supporting the remaining “ front,' i.e., Democrat versus Zulfiqari partisans. Until such time as the gendarmerie are firmly re-established it will not be possible to obtain information upon w r hieh to base an opinion of the Russians’ future intentions, but it may be said that the main hindrance to the re-establish ment of the Persian Government’s authority in areas officially evacuated by the Russians will be the existence in each large town of a small number of ex-soldiers in civilian dress in the guise of transport, fisheries, oil distribution and other Russian activities. In Azerbaijan and Khamseh there appear to be three possibilities, viz. : (i) the Russians may clear out lock, stock and barrel and abandon Democrat and Kurd alike to their fate, (ii) they may evacuate their troops but leave a stiffening of officers and n.c.o.s, to assist the Kurdish republican and Azerbaijan people’s armies with or without Russian military equipment, (iii) they may do the same thing more openly by prevailing upon the Azerbaijan National Government to ask for a Russian military mission. Internal Security. Khorasan. 3. His Majesty's Consul-General reports that insecurity on the roads is on the increase, tw-o instances of highway robbery having occurred within a short distance of Meshed during the last week in March. Kurdistan. 4. The situation at Sardasht, referred to in paragraph 9 of Intelligence Summary No. 11, and paragraph 6 of last Intelligence Summary, is still grave.I lie strength of the Persian army garrison besieged in the place is only 150 \\ hereas the attackers are variously reported as numbering from 2,000 to 3,000. Ihe Persian General Staff say they are mostly from the Pushtdari and Mangur tribes. His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah reports that, in the main, they are followers of Ghazi Muhammad from Mahabad with three or four hundred ol Mulla Mustafa Barzani's men. The Shakkak and Herki tribes were invited to join in the fray, but imposed conditions which were not acceptable to Ghazi Muhammad. Persian casualties, up to the 3rd April, were, according to the Persian General Officer Commanding, Kurdistan, four killed and twenty- five wounded. He estimated the Kurdish casualties, mostly inflicted by Persian air action, as over sixty killed. The Kurdish Republican forces are armed with heavy and light machine-guns, rifles, tommy-guns and hand grenades, supplied by the Russians. Most of the surrounding country is in the hands of the Kurdish Republican army, and the Persian General Officer Commanding is not very hopeful of the garrison’s ability to hold out until w 7 eather conditions permit the opening of the Senneh-Saqqiz road and the despatch of a relief column to Sardasht. 5. In the Democrat—Afshar “ front,' some 100 miles to the East near Shah in Dej, the Afshar tribal partisans of Government have achieved a minor success on the 26th March by beating off a night attack by the Democrats on their positions at Main Bulaq, iff miles north of Tikab. The Democrats left seven dead, mostly Armenians and Assyrians. Khamseh. 6. On the Democrat-Zulfiqari “front' the latter (Government partisans) have been repulsed and three of their strongholds have been captured by the Democrat rebel forces. Persian A rmy. 7. The Persian army is being very cautious in following up the Russian withdrawal. Mindful of its ignominious ejection from Sharifabad, near Qazvin, in December last, it does not wish to court another such blow to its prestige by running up against a Russian rear guard. It has been warned to avoid, at all costs, any possibility of an armed clash which might serve the Russians for a pretext to delay their departure. Apart from these considerations, it has its hands full in Kurdistan and is loath to deplete the capital of troops lest a Russian-inspired outbreak of the Tudeh party should occur. So far, the only move has been the despatch of a motorised column of about 250 men to Semnan via Garmsar. About 100 will remain to garrison this place (where the Tudeh have been in control under the large Russian garrison) and the remainder will return to Tehran via Firuzkuh. According to the Minister for War, a brigade is being assembled to proceed to Qazvin within the next few days. ’ Later on it is hoped to send a column to Shahi, which will subsequentlv move on to Gurgan. Pei 'sian Gendarmerie. 8. In contrast to the Persian army, the gendarmerie have been most active in reoccupying such places as have been evacuated by the Russians. Six companies in all have been despatched, one to Firuzkuh and Semnan, one to Kere], two to Resht, one to Shahi and one to Qazvin. At the latter place, according to Colonel Schwarzkopf, Russian rear parties were still in the town, but co-operated effectively in establishing the gendarmerie in temporary billets. Both army and gendarmerie realise that, provided they do not tread on the heels of the with drawing Russian troops, the reoccupation of the entire zone recently occupied by the Russians with the exception of Azerbaijan and Khamseh (Zenjan) will not present a difficult problem. The populace is either implacably hostile to the Russians, as it is on religious grounds in Meshed, only lukewarm in its Tudeh sympathies, as in Qazvin, or by nature cowardly, as in Gilan and Mazanderan. In Khamseh and Azerbaijan, however, the populace has been systematically worked upon by the Russians. A Democrat army, stiffened by Russian officers and men and aided with Russian military equipment, is actually in being and even the most optimistic among the senior Persian officers realise that aimed conflict of which the outcome cannot be predicted will result from any attempt to reassert the Persian army’s authority in those provinces.

Ibtehaj, Dr. Amini, Bader, Nikpur, Ali Vakili and some prominent merchants are the members. This is the second venture of its kind, the formation of a former Supreme Economic Council having been reported in Intelligence Summary No. 15 of April 1945. The main objects of the council are to raise the general standard of living and to ensure an equitable distribution of the country’s produce. The specific measures, for which the council has been charged to draw up plans, include the following :— (а) Increase in exports, with particular attention to packing. Prices must conform to international levels and, if necessary, subsidies are to be granted. (б) Imports must, in principle, be subject to quota, primarily to avoid compe tition with natiohal products. (c) The establishment of a plan for developing national industries. (^) The improvement of the relations between employers and employees. In this connexion it is proposed to seek guidance and technical assistance from the I.L.O. (e) A five-year plan is to be drawn up whereby municipalities can finance public services such as lighting, drainage, drinking water, telephone systems. (/) A minimum wage to be fixed for peasants. (g) Crown lands are to be sold to smallholders. {h) Irrigation schemes are to be developed. (i) Mining research and development to be carried out under national control. In cases where legislation is required the Prime Minister states that the council’s recommendations will be made effective by Cabinet decree, parliamentary sanction being sought later. The Economic Council will, in case of need, consult the Economic Committee of U.N.O. which will be requested, where necessary, to assist with expert advice. The selection of members is on the whole a good one, the Secretary-General being Amini, a former Deputy Prime Minister who is competent and honest. Taken at its face value there is much in the programme to command support but to bolster up inefficient local industries and to protect them against imports is a thoroughly retrograde step. The cynically minded and those with previous experience of the fate and achievements of similar bodies in the past will see in these pronouncements a piece of political window-dressing forced upon the Prime Minister by the pressure of outside events and primarily designed to steal the Tudeh thunder. Communications. 10. The breaches in the I.S. Railway between Andimishk and Ahwaz caused by floods in the Karkheh River have been repaired and through running was resumed on the 25th March. 11. As was to be expected, a sharp deterioration in the condition of Persia’s highways has set in since the British military authorities handed them back to the Ministry of Roads and Communications. On a recent trip to Meshed and back the British Military Attache found this road in a shocking state. Practi cally no maintenance was being carried out, and along the entire length of over 600 miles not more than seventy labourers were seen. The section Firuzkuh- Semnan has been abandoned and after the spring rains it will disintegrate and become impassible. All traffic now proceeds via Garmsar.

They made contacts with various politicians and political groups in Tehran, but failed to \isit Azerbaijan as the Soviet authorities did not grant them the necessarv passes to enter their zone. 14. His Majesty’s Embassy have asked the Persian Ministry for Foreign Aifairs for permission, on a temporary basis, to resume the B.O.A.C. passenger and freight service between Athens and Tehran via Beirut, Lydda and Bagdad. This will be an extension of the already existing service between London and Athens. 15. The Azerbaijan manager of the A.I.O.C., M. Faroughi, was arrested by the Soviet military authorities on trumped-up charges of espionage and trespass. Representations by His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General, Tabriz, secured his release, the Soviet commandant stating that, upon investigation, the charges were found to be baseless. He was, however, immediately rearrested on the orders of the. Azerbaijan National Government, acting, of course, under orders from the Russians. He has been expelled from Azerbaijan, being given four days within which to arrange his departure. The National Government have long been displeased at M. Faroughi’s refusal to pay to them excise duties on the company’s products sold in Azerbaijan and the Russians will welcome the retirement from their zone of the representative of a rival concern.

A report, believed to be reliable, states that the Russians are still boring for oil at Haft tan, near Shahi. # 18.

[E 3681/315/34] Copy No.1 Military Attache's Intelligence Summai-y No. 14, Secret, for the Period Sth A'pril to lAith April, 1946.— {Communicated in Tehran despatch No. 118 of \5th April: Received 20th April.) Persian Affairs. Political. TELEGRAMS of congratulation on the signing of the Russo-Persian Agree ment on Evacuation, Oil and Azerbaijan have been exchanged between the Persian Prime Minister and Generalissimo Stalin. 2. Letters have been exchanged between the Prime Minister and the Russian Ambassador confirming the previous communique concerning the evacuation and amplifying the statement about the formation of the Russo-Persian Oil Company. For the first twenty-five years the Persian Government’s holdings are to be 49 per cent, as against the Soviet Government’s 51 per cent. Tor the next twenty-five years they are to be equal. Profits are to be divided between the two Governments in proportion to their shares. The area of the company’s operations is described as follows : Junction of the Russian-Turkish and Persian frontiers- Lake Urumiyeh-along the eastern shore of the lake to Miandoab-Gilyaban-the crest of the Elburz range to Kauk Kila (unidentified but on the Iranian State Railway north of Firuzkuh)-lat. 34 15: long. 55-00-due east to lat. 34-15: long. 55-00-north to Abersij (unidentified but near Gunbad-i-Qabus)-east to Quchan-south-east to junction of Russian, Persian and Afghan frontiers. The capital subscribed by the Persian Government shall be deemed to consist of the oil-bearing land conceded. The Soviet Government shall bear the entire cost of development, equipment and wages. After fifty years the Persian Government shall have the option of buying out the Russian share. The protection of the area, together with all wells and installations, shall be effected solely by the Persian security forces. A Bill to provide for the formation of a joint Russo- Persian Company on the above terms shall be submitted to the Majlis within seven months of the 24th March. The above terms could be criticised on many grounds, but one salient weakness, from the Persian Government's point of view, is in the system of share by profit and not, as in most modern oil concessions, by fixed royalty or on the basis of the volume of production. As it stands, there is every inducement for the company to produce oil as cheaply as possible, or even at a loss, for the benefit of the Soviet Government and to declare that no profit has been made. 3. Qawam-us-Saltaneh continues his policy of appeasement of the Russians. As stated in last week’s Intelligence Summary, pressure w T as being brought to bear on him by the Russians, and by his Cabinet on the Minister for War, to arrest General Arfa, the late C.G.S. He was arrested on the night of the 8th/9th April on charges of endangering the safety of the realm by supplying arms and ammunition to subversive elements in Gilan and Mazanderan. The Minister for War has so far resisted the demands of the four Russian tools in the Cabinet (General Firuz, Muwarrikh-ud-Dowleh, Bahar and Zuka-ud-Dowleh) to try General Arfa in a civil court, and has insisted on his trial by the military tribunal which alone has jurisdiction over officers of the Persian army. If the charges were limited to those stated above, General Arfa would stand a fair chance of acquittal as he could produce written authority for his acts signed by the then Minister for War, General Riazi. He could also argue logically enough that there was no difference in principle between arming “ Jangalis” to fight Tudeh rebels in Gilan and arming Zulfiqari and Afshar partisans to fight Democrat rebels in Azerbaijan. Meanwhile Qawam’s subservient attitude to Russian demands, the arrest, by his orders, of many of those prominent for their pro-British feelings; the suppression of nearly all of the newspapers hostile to Russia ; his failure to arrest a single Tudeh rebel or agitator, and rumours of his intentions to ask the Security Council to remove the Perso-Russian dispute from [77—3]the agenda have caused widespread alarm and despondency among the more stable elements in the country and have been claimed as an overwhelming de ea. for the British in Persia. Russian Evacuation. 4. Except from Azerbaijan, the scanty news received points to the evacuation, steady though in small numbers, of Russian troops from Bandar ohah, Naushahr and Pahlavi. Rear parties for evacuation of stores amd liquidation of claims and assets of about 150 officers and men still remain in Meshed and Qazvin. Otherwise the areas between Tehran and Meshed and between lehran and Resht appear to be almost clear of troops. His Majesty s Acting Consul- General, Tabriz, reports that Zenjan is believed to have been evacuated, anc Mianeh nearly so, but that no movements of complete units from Tabriz have been observed. Internal Security. M azanderan. 5. Some fighting is reported to have taken place near ( halus and Naushahr beween the Tudeh and Jangali parties. A company of gendarmes has been despatched from Sari to maintain order. Khamseh. 6 . The Zulfiqari and Afshar partisans have suffered defeats at the hands of the Democrat rebels. Jealousy between the leaders, the superior armament (some of it supplied by the Russians) of their opponents and disappointment at the cessation of support by the Persian Government, also seasonal demands of agriculture, are the causes. Kurdistan. 7. His Majesty’s Consul, Kermanshah, on the authority of a report by a gendarmerie officer recently returned from Senneh, states that the Kurds have raised the siege of Sardasht and have dispersed. Persian military circles are of the opinion that this may imply a concentration of Kurds further north for the resumption of their struggle against the Iraqi Government. It is possible that the Russians’ announcement of their evacuation of Persia and Kurdish fears of being left unaided may have something to do with the cessation of hostilities around Sardasht. A zerbaijan. 8 . His Majesty’s Consul, Tabriz, reports that the Azerbaijan People’s army now claims that it is on a war footing. Training under Russian instructors continues and a batch of forty cadets is said to have left Tabriz on the 9th April for Baku for training as officers. 9. The Cabinet of the Azerbaijan National Government is considering the selection of representatives to proceed to Tehran to negotiate with the Persian Government the terms of the agreement to be concluded. 10 . The Azerbaijan National Government has installed a wireless transmitter which broadcasts in Turki and Persian nightly on 380 metres. Persian A rmy. 11 . The Ministry for War has accepted on behalf of the Persian Govern ment the invitation of His Majesty's Government to receive a Persian army detachment at the forthcoming victory celebrations to be held in London in June. The party will consist of three high ranking officers, three staff officers, a colour party of three officers and a detachment of twenty-four other ranks. 12. The “ Personnel Department ” (corresponding to the Military Secretary’s branch at the War Office), hitherto under the exclusive control of the C.G.S., has been changed into a directorate responsible jointly to the Ministry of War and General Staff. Sartip Muzayyini, late G.O.C. 2nd Tehran Division, is to be its new chief. 13. The new divisional headquarters recently set up at Hamadan is to be transferred to Qazvin, where it will not only raise and train the new 3rd Division, but will receive and organise columns sent from Tehran for onward despatch to reoccupy areas to be evacuated by the Russians. In the meanwhile, hearing that a rear party of about 150 officers and men had been left behind in Qazvinby the Russians to evacuate stores and liquidate claims, &amp;c., the Prime Minister has instructed the Minister for War to delay the despatch of the column to (^azvin lest any clash should occur. • Persian Air Force. ^ 14. The Minister for War informed the B.M.A. that two more officers of vhe Persian Air Force deserted with their machines on the 13th April. They are believed to have joined the Azerbaijan People’s army in Tabriz. A ppointments. 15 “ 4 ”— Civil. —(i) Ahmad Musaddiq to be director-general of the I S. Railway vice Husain Nafisi. A previous announcement in the press stated that Ahmad Musaddiq was to officiate as director-general during the absence of Husain Nafisi on four months’ leave, but the appointment is now believed to be permanent since Husain Nafisi was arrested on the 11 th April on charges of embezzlement by General Muhammad Husein Firuz, the Minister of Roads and Communications. Husain Nafisi was honest by Persian standards and a capable official, well thought of by the British military railway personnel who worked with him throughout the war. His arrest is said to have annoyed the 1 rime Minister as it was done without his permission or knowledge, and also because it will make enemies of this wealthy and influential family which is connected to the Prime Minister by marriage through the Aminis. (ii) Baud Pirnia to be director-general in the Inspectorate of the Prime Minister’s office.

A report has been received from more than one source that the Russians have recently made a deal with the Azerbaijan National Government foi the purchase of 10,000 tons of wheat. A further contract was said to have been signed for another 15,000 tons. A gricultural. 19. A recent Cabinet decree prohibits the cultivation of the opium poppy throughout Persia. Communications. 20. During the past week a further breach in the southern section of the I S. Railway was caused by the collapse of a tunnel near Safid Dasht. Tranship ment of passengers and goods was carried out foi two oi three days. Through running was resumed on the 12 th April. ' 21. The Journal de Tehran states that the passenger service between Tehran and Qazvin, which was interrupted by the seizure of the railway line between Kerej and Qazvin by the Democrat rebels, will be resumed with effect from the 17th April.4 British Interests. 22 .

Ao. 124 o/ the 23 rd April; Received May.) Persian Affairs. Political. AS reported in a postscript to last week's Intelligence Summary, the Persian Government sent instructions to Husein Ala in Washington to withdraw Persia's case from the agenda of the Security Council. In a Government communique it was stated that this step had been taken as the result of a renewed assurance by the Soviet Ambassador in Tehran on the 14th April to the effect that Russian forces will evacuate Persian territory unconditionally before the 6 th May. There is no doubt that renewed and considerable pressure was brought to bear on the Persian Prime Minister bv the Soviet Ambassador to get this done. The Prime Minister informed both His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires and the American Charge d’Affaires that he was told by the Soviet Ambassador that, if he did not do so, the Soviet Government would consider it as an insult. In the course of an audience with His Imperial Majesty the Shah, the British Military Attache was informed that the Qawam had given the Shah a different version of the pressure brought to bear upon him, namely, that if he did not take this step, disorders might break out in Tehran, disorders for which the Russians would not be responsible and which they would not be able to control. 2 . Reuter's correspondent in Tehran was informed in an interview by the Persian Prime Minister that conversations were expected to begin in the very near future at Kerej between the representatives of the Persian Government and the Azerbaijan National Government. The Russians are believed to be particularly anxious to see these conversations concluded before the 6 th May. 3. An official proclamation issued by the Prime Minister regarding the preservation of security in the northern regions of Persia, calls upon ail owners of firearms to deliver them to the nearest gendarmerie post within one month. The death penalty is prescribed for offenders. On Qawam's present form it is unlikely that this law will be enforced against any Democrat or Tudeh rebel who has been given arms by the Russians. Russian Evacuation. 4. There is very little to add to the information given in paragraph 4 of last Intelligence Summary. His Majesty's Consul-General at Meshed reports that the remainder of the Russian troops left Meshed on the 10 th April. A Persian press report states that Resht has been evacuated, the Russian military headquarters having been moved to Pahlevi till the embarkation of Russian troops has been completed. His Majesty's Acting Consul-General at Tabriz reports some increased Russian military lorry traffic between the barracks and the railway station carrying men and stores. The impression gained, he states, is one of a gradual removal of oddments rather than the move of any complete unit. There are no signs that the armoured formations at Zenjan and Miandoab have returned to Tabriz. On the 16th April a column of cavalry and infantry (strength unknown but sufficiently long to take an hour to pass a given point) actually arrived in Tabriz from the direction of Julfa. 5. There are many who believe that the Russians will not evacuate Azerbaijan by the 6 th May. Knowing what little importance the Russians attach to their pledges, they predict that the Russians will find some pretext for evading them. Azerbaijan may suddenly vote for secession from Persia and’ hence will no longer be considered by the Russians as Persian territory. Clashes between Democrats and the advancing Persian gendarmerie or army mav occur. Some Russian soldiers will certainly be reported as killed. A civil war will be deemed to have broken out. To stop this conflagration spreading to the frontiers of the Soviet Union and endangering its safety the Russians may again invoke the 1921 Treaty and tc reluctantly ” be forced to retain their troops in Azerbaijan. [77—25]2 &lt;V •4 Again, there are others who predict that the Russians, while evacuating their uniformed forces, will retain the large number of Caucasian officers and men at present attached as instructors to the Azerbaijan Peoples army. Other military personnel, disguised as civilians, will be located in all the important towns in the guise of consular staffs, trade agents, employees of the Soviet Govern ment oil distributing agency, the transport agency or the Caspian fisheries concession. Zenjan. Internal Security. ^ 6 . Reference was made in paragraph 6 of last Intelligence Summary to reverses suffered by the Zulfiqari and Afshar partisans of Government who were fighting the Democrat rebels. His Majesty's Vice-Consul, Hamadan, reports that the latter have now captured Zarinabad on the road from Zenjan to Razan and are rumoured to have taken Tuzlu also. This would bring them within 55 miles of Hamadan itself. The Minister for War is fully alive to this new threat but cannot secure Cabinet assent to the despatch of reinforcements to Hamadan, and was informed by them that he must avoid any military action which might displease the Russians! Isfahan. 7. Disturbances broke out on the 10th April between the Tudeh and the Workers’ Union. Casualties were numerous. The labour leader Fidakar is at present in Isfahan and refuses to obey a summons to return to Tehran sent to him by the Prime Minister. The Tudeh agitators were encouraged by the news of the recall of Varasteh the Governor-General, who has administered Isfahan firmly and impartially for the past two years, and of Colonel Garzan, the Divi sional Commander, both of whom were consistently pilloried in the Tudeh news papers as repressive and reactionary. An uneasy calm at present reigns in the town. The Governor-General has been instructed to remain at his post but he sees little use in doing so unless he is strongly supported by the Central Govern ment. At the present moment this support is hardly likely to be forthcoming. Censorship. 8 . Two telegrams, dated the 14tti and 15th April respectively, addressed by The Times correspondent to his paper have been suppressed by the Persian postal authorities. In an interview, demanded by all British and American newspaper correspondents in Tehran, with the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones, the latter official defended his action by quoting article 26 of the International Telegraph Communication Convention of 1932, which allows contracting Governments to stop the transmission of any private telegram which may appear dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to public order or decency. He also informed the correspondents that no reason need be given for the stoppage of telegrams, nor would they be told if and when their messages were stopped in the future. He concluded by giving a cate- g*orical assurance that there was no censorship in Persia ! The first of the two offending messages was critical of the Persian Prime Minister's policy and hinted that the Russians might be aiming at the eventual setting up a republic in Persia. Subsequently, all cables filed by British and American correspondents in Tehran to their respective newspapers reporting the above incident were held by up the Persian postal authorities. It is understandable that Qawam, having “ sold the pass,” does not wish to have the deal broadcast. Finance. 9. The Cabinet has approved a 2/12ths budget Bill to cover the period the 21st March-20th May, 1946. 10. The following table shows the latest income tax scale drawn up by the Financial Laws Commission. It is to be enforced as from the 21st March, 1946 :— Rials per annum . Up to 12,001 From 12.001 to 20,000 , 20,001 to 40,000 „ 40,001 to 100.000 „ 100,001 to 200,000 „ 200,001 to 300,000 „ 300,001 to 400,000 „ 400,001 to 500.000 On more than 500,000 Free of tax 3% of excess over 12,001 6 % „ „ „ 20,000 10 % „ „ „ 40,000 15 % „ „ „ 100,000 20 % „ „ „ 200,000 25 % „ „ „ 300,000 28 % » ,, „ 400,000 30% rials tax s basis goes done, royal quein Rersi ] from to Te whicl 1 batte Qazv 1 tion c since timid strom he w* to tr) Sumn has a unwil consis Appo 1 ( (i ( 0 for F&lt; the or (&lt; the Pi War.

The announcement goes on to explain that the Persian Government, considering, as it always has done, that Bahrein was an integral part of Persia, had not hitherto levied any loyalty on its oil products brought into the Persian mainland and that, in conse quence, its products were able to undersell those of the A.I.O.C. A desire to increase its revenues had now led the Persian Government to impose this duty. Persian army. ^ The Ministry for War have announced that three of the officer deserters ^ 1 n k° raSan (i m plicated in the mutiny of last August) who were being brought tojehran for trial managed to give their escort the slip and escaped in a motor car which had been held in readiness for them. 13. A Persian army column of infantry with some armoured cars and a battery of mountain artillery of a total strength of 2,000 of all ranks occupied Qazvm on the 18th April without any untoward incident. 14. Sarlashgar Aghevli, the Chief of the General Staff, tendered his resigna tion on the 18th April. The acceptance has not been officially announced. Ever since his assumption of the appointment General Aghevli has appeared lethargic, timid and bewildered by the rapidly changing scene. His constitution was never strong and he has recently been suffering from rheumatism. The crisis came when he was appointed President of the Military Tribunal which is being assembled to try General Hasan Arfa, his predecessor (see paragraph 3 of last Intelligence Summary). . He is in no sense a Russian tool. Being a man of some principles he has a loathing for Qawam’s mendacity and duplicity. Being a patriot he was unwilling to convict, under Russian pressure, General Arfa of an offence which consisted of resistance to Russian bullying and intervention.

The Russian-controlled newspapers, which form about 75 per cent, of those still appearing have intensified their attacks on British policy and actions in Persia. Officials, civil or military, who refuse to play the Tudeh game—and their number is being steadily reduced by the Prime Minister and Minister of the4 Interior—are portrayed as British agents and any attempt on their part to main tain order is hailed as an act of savage repression performed by the orders of their reactionary and imperialistic masters. 17. The Tudeh organ, Rahbar, in a recent article, pointed out that article 29 of an agreement signed by the American Persian Gulf Command and by Hajir, the then Minister of Finance, provided for the handing back to the Persian Government by the 30th November, 1946, of the port and installations of Fahliyeh Creek near Khorramshahr in order that the British might remove. . within the stated interval, their railway and other equipment. This, said Rahbar, proved that the so-called evacuation of Persia by British troops was merely a piece of deception. British Interests. 18.

A n declaration i? by the Persian Prime Minister regarding the corr^rsat ioste to be carried out with the representatives of the Azerbaijan National Government is published as an Appendix to this I Summary. There is considerable doubt as to whether this declaration ia a decree, or a proposal, or merely a list of 'talking points'.

Section 1. [E 4400/315/34] Copy No. i 4 3 Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 17, Secret, for the 'period '2§th April to 'bth May, 1946.— {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 136 of 7th May ; Received \Ath May) Persian A ffairs. Political. NO result of the conversations now taking place in Tehran between the Persian Government and the representatives of the Azerbaijan Government has been announced, and it is believed that a deadlock has been reached-—probably over the question of the Azerbaijan People’s Army. The Persian Government realise that as long as this force is in being their own army cannot force its way into Azerbaijan. Conversely, the Azerbaijan Government representatives realise that as long as this force exists their position vis-d-vis the Persian Government is strong. The Russians naturally wish the force to continue in being as an instrument with which to enforce their will on Azerbaijan and a means of infiltrating Soviet military personnel into Persia in the guise of instructors and advisers. 2. The Cabinet have approved a proposal of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that a sum of 160,090 dollars, being one year’s contribution by the Persian Govern ment to the expenses of U.N.O., be paid by the Treasury. 3. A Persian press bureau communique announces that Mirza Karim Khan Reshti has been arrested for “ action against the Government.” It is believed that Karim Khan was supporting the “ jangalis ” in their struggle with the Tudeh party in Gilan and Mazanderan, and was also connected with the “ Western Tribal Union ” referred to in paragraph 7 of last Intelligence Summary. He was a frequent visitor to the Shah and had also been a confidant of the late Reza Shah. Russian Evacuation. 4 . The position, based on information from His Majesty’s Consul-Generals, Meshed and Tabriz, and a reconnaissance of the southern shore of the Caspian by the British military attache, is as follows :— Khorasan. No Soviet military forces remain, but a small number of soldiers in mufti are reported by the Persian military to be living with Russian emigres. Mazanderan and Gurgan. These provinces have been evacuated save for detaeiiments of fifty soldiers each at Bandar Gaz and Bandar Shah guarding military dumps which are awaiting shipment. Gilan. This province has been evacuated. A Russian naval officer with a small staff resides at Astara and visits Pahlevi two or three times a week. The Governor- General of Gilan and the Governor of Mazanderan told the British military attache that, apart from a large number (said to be over 1 , 000 ) of Russian subjects from the Caucasus now in these provinces, there had been a large increase in the number of Russians employed in the Caspian Fisheries Concession (Iranryba), the Russian Transport Organisation (Iransovtrans), and the Russian Oil Distributing Agency (Persanaft), and in Russian consular staffs. Azerbaijan. This province appears to have been evacuated, the last party having left Tabriz in a ceremonial parade on the 5th May. The column consisted of 188 lorries, 18 guns, 8 armoured cars, 16 carriers, 20 trucks. Apart from drivers and crews the troops did not exceed 300 in number. Some Russian officers watched [77—101]the departure and remained behind in Tabriz. They will, presumably, be a liquidation staff. Up to the 3rd May Russian railway personnel were still guarding the Tabriz goods yard and Russian military personnel the railway line. No Russian service aircraft have been seen in Tabriz for the past sixteen days. A stara. This place, visited by the British military attache on the 1st May, is in complete control by the Azerbaijan army, over 100 of whom were seen in mufti. Eighty per cent, of them appeared to be Caucasian types, and some Trans-Caspian types of Mongol and Uzbeg were noticed. They were all armed with new Brno rifles of Persian army manufacture, the numbers noticed being in the 90,000 series which were those supplied recently by the Persian army arsenal to the Russians under contract. General. The entire amount of armour (estimated at an armoured corps) brought into Azerbaijan has not been definitely accounted for, but some may have moved out by night and some may have returned to Russia from the Miandoab area by the west side of Lake Urumiyeh and thus have escaped the notice of His Majesty's Acting Consul-General at Tabriz. Similarly no satisfactory evidence is to hand to prove that the armour sent to Zenj an has returned. Only personal reconnais sance during the next few weeks can clear up these two points. In the mean while, in the light of information he has received from various sources, the acting consul-general does not think that any armour remains at Maragheh or Miandoab. That considerable numbers of Russians remain in mufti attached to the democrat forces as instructors, advisers or merely as a stiffening is beyond doubt. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 5. General Amanullah Jehanbani, who has been on a tour of inspection in Kurdistan for the past month, stated to His Majesty’s Consul Kermanshah, that the road Saqqiz-Baneh-Sardasht had been opened by a column from Saqqiz. This column encountered slight opposition only and is now engaged in clearing the villages in the vicinity of Sardasht from the Kurdish insurgents. The rest of this “ front ” the general reported as quiet. Kermanshah. 6 . A clash occurred during the May Day celebrations between the police and the local supporters of the Tudeh party/ According to a press report, a constable and a gendarme and four Tudeh members were killed and six Tudeh members wounded. Bakhtiari. 7. A Persian press report states that Amir Husain Zafar and Abul Qasim Bakhtiari have been appointed joint governors of Bakhtiari and Chahar Mahal The former is a son of the late Haji Khosro Khan, Sardar Zafar, and hence a member of the Ilyhani family, while Abul Qasim, a son of Amir Mufakham belongs to the rival branch of the Haji Ilkhanis. Azerbaijan. 8 . Radio Tabriz, in its transmission of the 3rd May, stated that on the 23rd April a treaty of friendship was signed by the Azerbaijan National Govern- mgent and the Kurdish National Government. For twenty years, it is stated in the premable of the treaty, those two nations were persecuted by the General Government under the dictatorship of Reza Shah Pahlevi, but they had neither the means nor the opportunity to free themselves of this tyranny. World War II has given them the opportunity to secure their freedom. This treaty has been signed to preserve this freedom. J The treaty has seven articles— ( 1 ) Each nation will send a diplomatic representative to the other (2) All Azerbaijanis in Kurdistan and all Kurds in Azerbaijan can hold Government positions. J (3) Trade agreement. (4) Mutual military assistance in case of aggression. (5) In case of negotiations with Central Government, these negotiation* should be carried out by both nations. 8( 6 ) The nationals of one country living in the other will have ail assistance from the latter's Government. (7) If an individual or a party has plotted against the safety of one of the two contracting Governments, the punishment to be meted out to the offender will be decided upon by both Governments. Signatories of the treaty :— Azerbaijan : Shabastari, head of Parliament; Pishevari, Prime Minister; Sadek Padekan, Assistant of Democrat Party; Dr. Javid, Minister of Interior; Mohd. Biria, Minister of Education. Kurdistan: Ghazi Mohamed, Prime Minister; Sayid Abdullah Goilani, Assistant Prime Minister; Arabkhan Sharifi, Mohamed Hossein Seif Ghazi, Jahangir Bahaderi, Deputies. Persian Army. 9. The Persian contingent for the Victory Celebrations in London left Tehran by rail on the 5th May. Delay of nearly two months on the part of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in replying to His Majesty's Government s invitation prevented the Ministry of War from selecting the party and the British military authorities from making arrangements in advance for their movement. Ten minutes before the time of departure tjie British military attache was informed that the senior officer, General Yazdanpanah, was sick and intended to follow later with his young son, that a colonel had been kept back to accompany him, and that Major-General Razmara did not propose to start until such time as air passages for himself and his wife could be provided. 10. Two battalions left Qazvin for Resht on the 3rd May and two more are to be sent in a fortnight’s time to the Gurgan area. These four battalions are from the central garrison. The brigade of two battalions at Qazvin is to be increased by another brigade of the same size. This force, presumably, will be held in readiness to advance on Zenjan and Azerbaijan if the present conversa tions between the Persian Government and the representatives of the Azerbaijan Government reach a conclusion permitting this step. Economic. 11 . Reference has been made in the past to the survey carried out by the British firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners of the Lar valley irrigation and hydro-electric project. It now appears that the cost is more than the Persian Government can afford and, according to the Persian press, a company is to be floated. Of the 1,440 million rials required, the Ministry of Agriculture will borrow 300 million from the National Bank. 700 million will be taken up by shareholders, with the proviso that at least 51 per cent, of the shares are held by Persians. The balance of 440 million Rials represents the cost of imported materials required for the scheme. Obituary. 12. (i) Dr. Ali Akbar Daftari, Counsellor at the Persian Embassy in Washington.

He has been under medical treatment in Switzerland. A Persian wit has said that Vossuq, having received the sum of £50,000 from the British at the close of World War I for services which he failed to render, had arrived in Tehran in time to see his brother receive a like sum from the Russians at the close of World War II for services which he dared not fail to render.Russian Interests. 15.

Persian Affairs. Political. 1 . No settlement has as yet been reached in the conversations between the Persian Government and the representatives of the Azerbaijan National Govern ment. The latter have made counter-proposals but, as far as is known, the Cabinet have stated that these are contrary to the Constitution and cannot be accepted and that they are not prepared to go beyond the seven points already published. In a conversation with His Majesty’s Ambassador, the Persian Prime Minister said that he had suggested to the Soviet Ambassador that, in view of his under taking to attempt to find a solution of the Azerbaijan problem by peaceful means and of his failure to do so, he should resign. To this proposal, according to Qavam-us-Saltaneh, the Soviet Ambassador had objected vehemently contending that, if Qavam had failed, he knew of no one who could succeed. He had urged Qavam to continue his efforts since, if force were used, a situation would arise in North Persia which would be detrimental to the country’s interests. 2. It is understood that there is no intention of issuing the Royal Proclamation concerning the next elections until the Azerbaijan issue is settled. Russian Evacuation. 3. There is very little to add to the information given in paragraph 4 of last Intelligence Summary. The Persian press reports the departure from Bandar Gaz and Bandar Shah of the detachments mentioned in paragraph 4 of last Intelligence Summary. American aerial reconnaissance by the assistant military attache on the 9th May up to a point 10 miles north of Marand on the Tabriz- Julfa road showed no Russian troops and the various columns mentioned in the postscript to last Intelligence Summary have presumably crossed the frontier into Russia. While reports from consular sources at Meshed and Tabriz and reconnaissance by the British military attach^ along the Caspian coast and the air attache over Azerbaijan have failed to disclose the continued existence of Russian troops after the 6 th May, there is no definite and incontrovertible proof that the evacuation is complete both in respect of men and material. Only a thorough search of the Zenjan area and the area south of Lake Urumiyeh can confirm this and such a search is at present impossible owing to the restrictions placed upon all foreigners’ movements by the Democrats in these two provinces. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 4 . The Minister for War informed the British Military Attach^ on the 7th May that, a few days previously, a clash had occurred between the Kurds and the Persian army garrison of Saqqiz at a point only 7 miles north of that town. A battalion from the garrison had gone out on a reconnaissance in force and had been attacked suddenly by a strong force of Kurds in the nearby hills. The troops suffered casualties amounting to fourteen killed and an unspecified number of wounded. They claimed to have inflicted one hundred casualties on the Kurds but this number is almost certainly a gross exaggeration. A representative of the Shakkak tribe is now in Tehran and the Minister for War is confident of securing the adhesion of some other tribes in the event of an advance north wards by the Persian army into Azerbaijan. In this he would appear to be unduly optimistic as the Kurds, apart from their dislike and mistrust of the Persian army, must realise that any reoccupation of Azerbaijan and reassertion of the Persian Government’s authority there must, inevitably, be followed by similar action in Kurdistan. [77—141]Kermanshah. 5. The Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs has had the impertinence to address a note to His Majesty’s Embassy in which they state that His Majesty’s Consul, Kermanshah, distributed 600 rifles to Abbas Qubadian (referred to in paragraph 7 of Intelligence Summary No. 16). 6 . The Russian Consul recently intervened on behalf of one Alawi, arrested for his part in the recent May Day riots, by asking the chief of police tx) release him. This official replied that releases were the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice. Azerbaijan. 7. His Majesty’s acting consul-general reports that, during the absence of the Azerbaijan Government’s delegates in Tehran, restrictions have been placed upon the movements of foreigners and that he is unable to obtain permission to travel about his consular district. 8 . Radio Tabriz still maintains a defiant note in its broadcasts. 9. His Majesty’s acting consul-general reports that 10 per cent, of the Russian railway personnel have remained after the 6 th May. Mazanderan. 10. A clash between Tudeh and anti-Tudeh elements occurred on the 5th May on the Firuzkuh-Shahi road in which Mashalleh, a local Tudeh notable, was killed. Allegations were made to the effect that the gendarmerie had supplied arms to the anti-Tudeh party. Isfahan. 11. The Labour leader Fidakar, accompanied by ten Labour representatives, has arrived in Tehran to discuss the Isfahan mill workers situation with the Persian Government. 12 . His Majesty’s Consul reports that Varasteh, the Governor-General, has again tendered his resignation and that Daulatabadi, the mayor, has been dismissed. Khorasan. 13. His Majesty’s Consul-General reports, after personal reconnaissance, that the Persian army has not yet re-established the frontier post at Bajgiran. In the nearby hills the Russians have demarcated the frontier with a high wire fence impassable to man or beast, while in the more open country the demarcation is by a ploughed strip which is kept freshly raked and which is patrolled regularly. The village of Firuzeh and its adjacent lands have not been restored to the Persians according to Article 3 of the Russo-Persian Treaty of February 1921. They are still in Russian possession and now lie about eight miles on the Russian side of the frontier as demarcated by the Russians. Fars. 14. According to consular reports from Shiraz there is some evidence to show that the recent changes in administrative posts and the removal of most of Qawam-ul-Mulk’s supporters and relations from office were the work of the Qashgai and not, as was first supposed, effected by the Central Government under Tudeh and Russian pressure. It was hardly to be hoped that Nasir Khan Qashgai could refrain from taking advantage of the Persian Government’s pre occupation with affairs in the north and of their weakness in the south resulting from their draining away military and gendarmerie for reinforcements. It remains to be seen whether Nasir Khan aims at establishing a paramount position for his clan under some form of provincial autonomy for Pars on the Azerbaijan model or whether he will be content to have his own nominees filling all Govern ment posts and thus leaving him an open field in which to continue his nefarious activities of selling his tribesmen’s share of tea, sugar and cloth on the black market. Khuzistan. 15. A strike occurred during the week in the A.I.O.C. distillation plant at Abadan. About 200 workers were involved. At one time the situation appeared serious and it was expected that the strike would spread to other plants. The company held discussions with the workers and agreed to two out of three of their demands. The men then returned to work. Protection was asked for and obtained from the Persian army divisional commander at Ahwaz.3 . Persian Gendarmerie. 16. The Tabriz radio, in a recent broadcast of a defiant tone, protested against the return to Azerbaijan of “ the corrupt ” Persian gendarmerie. During the past week there have appeared in the Tudeh newspapers some violent attacks on Colonel Schwarzkopf and his American mission accusing them, as is usual in the case of any official who carries out his duties vigorously, of being “ reactionary.” Persian Press. 17. The following table, compiled by the press attache to His Majesty’s Embassy, gives the comparative positions of the press on the 1 st March and! the 18th April, i.e., the period covered by Qavam-us-Sultaneh’s premiership :— Tyye of newspaper. Tudeh and Extreme Left, dailies Tudeh and Extreme Left, weeklies Moderate Left, dailies ...

Appointments. 18. —(i) The Italian Government have announced their agreement to the appointment of Fathullah Pakrevan (F.O. 169; M.A. 208) as Persian Minister in Rome. (ii) Azizullah Nikpay Ezaz-ud-dowleh, son of Ahmad Nikpay (F.O. 161; M.A. 199), to be Governor-General of the Vth Ustan (Kermanshah). (iii) Colonel Saffari, Chief Prefect of Police, to be Brigadier. British Interests. 19. The British firm of Metropolitan Vickers has failed to secure the contract for the supply of an electrical generating plant of 25,000 kw. for the Tehran municipality. The latter body have now agreed to purchase a second hand plant by Westinghouse of America of 7,400 kw. The municipality state that the decision to carry out the Far Valley project, which will ultimately provide 72,000 kw. for Tehran, has caused them to change their plans and purchase a smaller plant which will afford temporary relief from the present overloading of the existing plant. As the Lar project will take at least seven years to carry out, it is suspected that other considerations may have induced the municipality to change their minds. A merican Interests. 20. The new American Ambassador, Mr. George Allen, arrived in Tehran on the 5th May and presented his letters of credence to His Imperial Majesty The Shah on the 11 th May.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVLRN V ^ (&amp;kF' 27 ^^/^ (&amp; PERSIA.

P THE Azerbaiian Government delegates returned to Tabriz by air on the 13th May as the conversations between them and the Persian Governmen a resulted in a deadlock. On the 14th May the Persian I rime Minister made the statement included as an appendix to this Summary. Qawam-us-Saltaneh s ne move cannot be predicted. He must realise that the Persian army is m no ht state to undertake an all-out offensive against the Azerbaijan ai my, and that, if he were foolish enough to order it, the Russians would soon find a pretext ior bringing back their troops to restore the situation. To give in to the Azerbaijan delegates’ demands would result in the immediate loss of Azerbaijan and &gt; degrees of the rest of Persia and possibly in his own impeachment as a traitor To let the negotiations hang fire would probably be his natural inclination but the Russians are hardly likely to allow him to do this since a failure to reach an agreement would delay the next elections and hence the summoning ot the 15th Majlis and hence the presentation of the Bill for their oil concession. A rumour to the effect that the Prime Minister is considering the despatch ot a delegation to Tabriz to continue the talks does not lend colour to the view that he intends or would be allowed by the Russians to let the deadlock continue. It may well be that he feels that in Tabriz certain concessions to the Democrats demands can be made which could not be made in the tenser political atmosphere of Tehran. A fourth course, that of an appeal to U.N.O., does not appear probable for the threefold reasons of Persian vanity, Russian displeasure and a disbelief in U.N.O.’s power to help. . . ... 2 The Persian Government have sent a commission to Azerbaijan to report on the completion of the Russian evacuation. The composition of this commission does not inspire confidence. It consists of an inspector in the Persian Prime Minister’s office who is a jackal of Muzaffar Firuz, a politically-minded and dishonest colonel an editor of the extreme leftist newspaper Dad, and another editor whose newspaper, originally of the moderate Right, now appears to be actively supporting Qawam’s present policy. The commission has reached Julfa, on the Perso-Russian frontier, and is about to visit other important towns in Azerbaijan. On the basis of what they see, they will no doubt on their return submit a report to the effect that Russian evacuation of Azerbaijan is complete. 3 . On the 19th May the press published the text of a lengthy broadcast by the Prime Minister on the present situation. Its tone was firm and, in places, threatening. Comparing his task to that of a gardener, he said that it was his duty to eradicate ruthlessly all pests and insects which attacked his garden. Dishonest intriguers who trafficked with foreign embassies and caused unwarranted interference in Persia’s affairs were threatened with drastic action. While the broadcast is obviously intended to stifle all further criticism of his policy and actions by the Right, there are reasons for believing that His Imperial Majesty the Shah and his entourage are thereby warned that any interference by them with Qawam’s plans or any attempt on their part to throw him out of office will meet with failure. Internal Security. General. 4 . Whether Qawam-us-Saltaneh has or has not sold his country to the Russians is a matter of opinion incapable, as yet, of proof. That his Cabinet [78—24]is susceptible to Tudeh pressure is a fact. This has had unfortunate repercus sions throughout Persia, and officials charged with maintaining law and order are no longer willing to act firmly when they know that such action will not only not be supported by the Central Government, but will probably lead to their punishment or dismissal. Prom Isfahan, Kerman, Kermanshah. Khorasan and from Abadan reliable reports tell of the police standing idly by while Tudeh excesses are carried out in their presence. As w r as to be expected, the Persian army have not escaped this contagion, and several high-ranking Persian army, officers whose loyalty and good sense are beyond question have expressed to the British Military Attache their conviction that almost all Persian officers below field rank have been willing recipients of Tudeh propaganda and cannot be relied upon either in the major event of civil war against the Democrats or even in the minor tasks of assisting the civil powder in maintaining law and order. A zerbaijan. 5. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General reports that the training of the Azerbaijan People’s army, which was intensive during April, has slackened off since the departure of the Russian army. The spare-time training of members of the Democrat party continues. The same source states that the standard weapon of the People’s army is the tommy-gun. These were supplied by the Russians, probably from the iO.OOO made for them under contract by the Persian army arsenal in 1944-45. The standard weapon of the “Fidais ' (volunteers) is the Persian army B.R.N.O. rifle. Many of the numbers of these have been noted (nearly all in English figures in the 80,000 and 90,000 series), and they are known to be from the consignment of 41,000 also made in the Persian arsenal at the same time and under the same contract as the tommy-guns. 6 . A new law published by the Azerbaijan Government prohibits the import into Azerbaijan of any goods which are normally manufactured in Azerbaijan. All Government employees must wear locally woven textiles under pain of fine or dismissal. Kurdistan. 7. The casualties suffered by the Persian army in the clash with the Kurds near Saqqiz (reported in paragraph 4 of last Intelligence Summary) are now reported to have been heavier than at first believed. The killed amounted to twenty, the wounded to thirty-eight, while thirty-eight were taken prisoner by the Kurds. Two machine guns with 4,000 rounds of ammunition apiece and 100 rifles also fell into the hands of the Kurds. The morale of the Saqqiz garrison is, in consequence, at a low ebb. The Kurds now surround the town on three sides and are within rifle-shot range. General Jehanbani, the Inspector-General of the Forces of the West, has returned to Tehran and so have Generals Shaqqaqi and Ansari who went there recently to enquire into the causes of the defeat. 8 . General Ansari informed the British Military Attache on the 18th May that, according to information received by the Saqqiz garrison from friendly Kurds, the direct track from Mahabad to Sardasht was being made fit for use by M.T. by the Kurds assisted by Russian engineers in civilian dress. A telegraph line was also being put up along this route by the Russian engineers. Isfahan. 9. According to His Majesty’s Consul, opposition to the appointment of Amir Husein Khan as joint Governor of Bakhtiari (see paragraph 7 of Intelligence Summary No. 17) has been expressed both by Abul Qasim, the other joint Governor, and by Jehanshah Khan, the son of the late Governor. Murteza Quli Khan. It is by no means certain that the appointments will stand. Khorasan. 10 . The Russian Consul-General is already taking a great interest in the next elections, according to His Majesty’s Consul-General. He, accompanied by the Russian Vice-Consul, recently visited Turbat-i-Haidari, Kashmar and Khwaf. At Turbat-i-Haidari they proposed as a candidate one Noshin, a Tudeh agitator recently imported from Tehran into Meshed. At Kashmar they enquired about the chances of Manuchihr Taimurtash, their nominee for the last Majlis who was elected at the request of the Russians by the efforts of Ali Mansur the hte Governor-General of Khorasan. 11 . The Persian army Divisional Commander of Khorasan, Colonel Vossuq informed His Majesty’s Consul-General that a party of seven persons, TurkestanRussian officers in civilian clothes and Persian emigres, who had been residing in Ashkabad or Tashkent, had arrived in Meshed during the first week of May. Since their arrival the Tudeh party had made renewed efforts to establish contacts with junior Persian officers. Khuzistan. 12. On the 10th May the entire Persian staff at the oil-field of Agha Jari went on strike. They demanded :— {a) 100 per cent, increase in wages. (b) Double pay for overtime. (c) One month’s holiday per annum on full pay. (d) A holiday on Friday with pay. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company rejected these demands, whereupon the Tudeh leaders threatened to intern all British personnel and to take control of all essential services. The company’s officials asked for military protection, which was despatched with commendable promptitude from Behbehan and Ahwaz by the orders of Colonel Afshar Oglu, the Persian army Divisional Commander at Ahwaz. So far no acts of violence to personnel or property have occurred. The strike continues. Lurid accounts of the strike have appeared in the Tudeh press in Tehran in which the company is stated to have deprived the poor defenceless strikers of bread and water and to have turned out pregnant women into the desert to die of starvation, thirst and exposure. Persian Army. 13. It will be recalled that thirty-six officers of the Persian army who were suspected of complicity in the mutiny of last year were sent by General Arfa, the then Chief of the General Staff, to reside in Kerman under surveillance. (Paragraph 22 of Intelligence Summary Ao. 36 of 1945 refers.) Under Tudeh pressure the Cabinet recently ordered the Minister for War to release them and permit them to come to Tehran. On arrival they all received their arrears of pay and an out-station allowance. During the past week nineteen of the thirty-six deserted and have joined the Azerbaijan army. 14. A Persian army battalion has arrived in Pahlevi from Qazvin. According to the press it was warmly received. Another battalion has been sent to Gurgan. Persian 'Navy. 15. • Three out of the four small gunboats (the fourth was cannibalised to provide spares for the other three) have been handed back to the Persian navv at Khorramshahr. They were escorted by H.M.I.S. Sonapati, who took back the Indian crews. 16. The Persian navy’s floating dock is now at Aden, where it must remain till the monsoon is over. At the request of the Persian Government a telegram was sent to cancel its departure from Alexandria, but the telegram arrived too late. The Persian Government realise that its capacity (of about 6,000 tons) is far in excess of their requirements and wish to exchange it for a smaller one or, alternatively, to sell it. Appointments. 17 (i) Dr. Seyyid Ali Shaigan, formerly a professor at Tehran University, to be Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Education. (ii) Nadir Arasteh (F.O. 24; M.A. 32) to be Governor-General of Isfahan vice Varasteh resigned. The appointment to Isfahan of this degenerate and weak Qajar Prince with strong pro-Russian feelings will be a great encourage ment to the Tudeh faction there. Chinese Interests. 18 His Excellency Tieh Tseng-li, the Chinese Ambassador to Persia, has returned to Tehran after an absence of nearly seven months. Czechoslovak Interests. 19. M. Joseph Kadloc, Czechoslovak Minister since April 1943, has left Tehran on transfer.t x Appendix. Statement by Persian Prime Minister. At this moment when public opinion awaits with attention the outcome of the discussions between the Government and the representatives from Azerbaijan I consider it necessary to inform the public of the result of the discussions which have taken place during the last fifteen days by making clear the facts in the ^ public mind. It is clear to the representatives of the people of Azerbaijan who came to Tehran that I made the necessary effort with the best intentions and a peaceful attitude to solve the problems under discussion, and that I endeavoured to meet the demands of the representatives from Azerbaijan within the limits of the existing laws of the country. After the declaration of the 1 st Ordibehesht, 1325 ( 21 st April, 1946), had been issued and the Government’s seven-point decree published, certain circles protested against it and thought that my policy had exceeded the existing laws of the country. Although I trusted and still trust the good intentions of the representatives from Azerbaijan, as a result of the discussions which have taken place during the last fifteen days, I am sorry to say that some of their demands were outside the scope of the legal powers and the seven-point declaration of the Government, and for this reason the discussions have of necessity been postponed until a solution is found and the representatives from Azerbaijan have returned to Tabriz. The demands of the representatives of the people of Azerbaijan which differed from the legal powers and the seven-point declaration of the Government are as follows :— ( 1 ) In accordance with article 2 of the Government’s declaration dated the 1 st Ordibehesht, 1325 (21st April, 1946), the appointment of a Governor-General for Azerbaijan will be made by the Government taking into consideration the views of the Provincial Council. The representatives from Azerbaijan insisted that the selection of a Governor-General should be made on the proposal of the Provincial Council and the appointment then made by the Government. ( 2 ) In accordance with article 2 of the Government’s declaration dated the 1 st Ordibehesht, 1325 ( 21 st April, 1946), the appointment of officers commanding military and gendarmerie forces will be made by the Government. The representatives from Azerbaijan were of the opinion that the above-mentioned officers should be appointed on the proposal of the Provincial Council and the appointments then approved by the Government. (3) The distribution of public domains and ceded properties among the peasants which took place during the recent changes in Azerbaijan should be confirmed by the Majlis in accordance with the existing laws, and the adoption of decision of the Government on this subject is outside the scope of the legal powers of the Government. The above- mentioned questions and other problems were discussed, but since the Majlis should take the decision on most of these problems, therefore, without any decision being taken for the present, the representatives from Azerbaijan returned to Tabriz to submit a report and to receive further instructions. Because with the best of peaceful intentions I desire to find a solution for these problems, it is obvious that I shall be prepared to continue the discussions and to find a solution for these difficulties through the adoption of a policy which does not differ from the laws of the country. Since in accordance with the stipulations of the law and taking into consideration the Government’s undertaking about oil in the north in accordance with the agreements exchanged with the Soviet Government the 15th Majlis should convene within seven months of the date of the signature of the above- mentioned agreements, the rescript for the general elections must be announced as soon as possible. I expect that the representatives from Azerbaijan will provide the facilities necessary to enable the Government to announce the general elections in accordance with the stipulations of the law and to enable the people of Azerbaijan to elect their representatives freely and to send them to the capital. I hope that the good intentions and patriotism which I felt among the representatives from Azerbaijan will prove sufficient to relieve the anxiety felt by the public, and that taking into consideration the legal duties of the Govern ment the present difficulties will be resolved on all counts.■■I THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT June 5, 1946. PERSIA. Section 2. SECRET. Copy No. 4 ’ l E 5133/315/34] Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 20, Secret, for the Period 20£4-26£A May, 1946.— (Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 167 of 29 £ A May; Received 5th June.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE letter addressed to the Security Council by Husein Ala, Persia’s Ambassador to the United States and representative at U.N.O., has had sharp repercussions in Persia. Mr. Ala’s letter, written, it must be admitted, without instructions from his Government, complained that Russian interference in Azerbaijan had not ceased and that it was therefore impossible to check the accuracy of reports which stated that Russian soldiers had been left behind in civilian dress and that Russian military material had been placed at the disposal of the rebel Democrat forces. On the strength of the report submitted by the Persian Government commission which went to Azerbaijan to investigate Russian military evacuation (see paragraph 4 below) the following statement was issued on the 24th May by the Prime Minister :— “Asa result of the investigation made by the officials sent to Azerbaijan, who have certified the evacuation of Azerbaijan by the Red army, a report based on this investigation has been cabled to the embassy in Washington for communication to the Security Council. I also publish hereunder a note from the Russian Embassy for the information of the public :— ‘Your Excellency, ‘ Pursuant to my verbal statements made on the instructions of the Soviet Government on the 22nd May, I respectfully confirm hereby that the withdrawal of the Red army from Iran had been completed by the 9th May according to the plan for evacuation which had been announced by the Caucasian General Staff at the end of March. Please accept my sincerest (Signed) M. Sadtchikov.’ ’’ respects. 2. In a series of interviews to the press Muzaffar Firuz, the Prime Minister’s spokesman, made it clear that Mr. Ala had exceeded his instructions and stated that steps had been taken to ensure that, in future, he should com municate to the Security Council only what he was instructed to communicate. After this undignified repudiation of Persia’s Ambassador, Muzaffar Firuz was condescending enough to say that Mr. Ala still enjoyed the confidence of the Persian Government. It has been known for a long time that the Russians regard Husein Ala as one of the sharpest thorns in their path and the Persian Prime Minister has admitted to the American Ambassador that M. Sadtchikov had, after accusing him of double-dealing, demanded, as proof of his good faith, the recall of Ala. The American Government, through their ambassador at Tehran, has intervened on Ala’s behalf, urging that his recall at this juncture would be damaging to the prestige of U.N.O. For the present, therefore, Ala remains, but his tenure of office cannot be regarded as secure. 3. In an interview accorded to a United Press representative in Tabriz Pishevari is reported as saying that the conversations recently broken off at Tehran would be resumed shortly and that the Persian Prime Minister was about to despatch his delegation to Tabriz. Pishevari stated that, though he did not know the names of the Persian Government representatives, he “ thought it very likely” that Sadiq Sadiqi Mustashar-ud-dowleh (F.0.193; M.A. 248), General Muhammad Husein Mirza Firuz (F.0.72; M.A. 94) and Muhammad Wali Farmanfarmayan (full brother to General Firuz) (F.O. 73; M.A. 95 ) would be chosen. Moscow would approve of this selection. 4. The Government commission, referred to in paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary, has returned to Tehran and submitted its report, which was as predicted. It states that “ during the period of one week they toured by [78—68]motor car various parts of the province and made careful enquiries from re 1 a e persons and despatched reports to the Government Their reports indicate t a in Tabriz and its environs and Marand, Julfa, Khoi. Salmas, Maku, Kezaie , Miandoab, all of which are important centres of Azerbaijan and which were carefully inspected by the committee, no trace remains of the Red forces, t leir equipment or their transport. Information obtained from trustworthy persons shows that the evacuation was completed on the 6 th May. ’ The commission not allowed to inspect barracks or any military installations. They did notf^P leave the highway at any point. They did not reach any of the three fronts, viz., the Democrat-Zulfiqari partisan front south of Zenjan, the Democrat-Aishar partisan front near Shahin Dej nor the Kurdish— Persian army front near feaqqiz. On the basis of what they saw in the places visited their report could not come to any other conclusion. , 5. Two more newspapers (it is needless to say they did not belong to the Left) have been suppressed, Paikar-i-Ruz and Khawar. They ventured to criticise the present policy of the Government. The anti-British .tone of the press has become so violent during the past month or two that His Majesty s Ambassador was obliged to make representations on the subject to the Persian Prime Minister. Qawam-us-Saltaneh expressed ignorance of this campaign of slander and asked for particulars. 6 . Three more Right-wing politicians have been arrested. I hey were Ali Dashti and Jamal-ud-din Imami of the Adalat party and Deputies for Tehran in the late Majlis, and Sannandaji, a Deputy for Sannandaj and a close associate of Seyyid Zia-ud-din. Lari, a prominent merchant and a supporter of Seyyid-ud-din, has also been arrested. The Elections. 7. The newspaper Iran came out with the following : hollowing the publication of the Prime Minister’s communique and the complete evacuation of the Red Army, the necessary steps are being taken for the election of the Fifteenth Parliament. The High Council for the Flections are studying the matter and. according to information received, the Prime Minister has given orders for the necessary papers, forms, &amp;c., to be printed and distributed so that everything may be ready for the elections to begin throughout the country so soon as the Azerbaijan question has been settled.” The prospect of early elections is causing dismay among the more stable elements in Persia. With the political leaders of the Right behind bars, the Right-wing press under suppression, and Tudeh influence supreme in all Ministries, they fear with justification that the Tudeh will come in with an overwhelming majority. They know their own inability to co-operate or organise and realise that if in the late Majlis a Tudeh minority of eight, speaking with one voice and efficiently organised from Moscow, could successfully impose their will upon a disorganised majority of 120 , there will be no effective opposition to a Tudeh bloc of perhaps ten times its former size. Internal Security. Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. 8 . Three more clashes between Persian troops and the Kurds and Persian troops and Democrats have occurred since the skirmish reported in paragraph 4 of Intelligence Summary No. 18 :— (i) On the 18th May the Persian garrison of one battalion at Main Bulagh (near Shahin Dej, 50 miles north-east of Saqqiz) was attacked by “ Fidais” (volunteers of the Democrat rebel forces). They used both machine guns and mortars. Some twenty Afshar tribal partisans of Government arrived from Shahin Dej to assist the garrison and twenty villagers of Main Bulagh were also provided with arms. They beat off the Democrat forces, inflicting on them casualties of six killed. The Persian garrison’s losses were nil. (ii) On the 20 th May, at Saqqiz, the garrison was again attacked by the Kurds, among whom Mulla Mustafa Barzani’s men were prominent. Six rounds of artillery fire by the Persian troops caused the Kurds to retreat, leaving six killed and nine wounded. The Persians lost one officer and four other ranks killed and five wounded. (iii) On the 23rd May, at Baneh, the garrison was attacked by the Kurds (Mangur and Herki) and lost one officer and four other ranks killed and four wounded.These skirmishes have been magnified by Radio Tabriz into unprovoked and full- dress attacks on Azerbaijan by the Persian army. The Azerbaijan People s army, according to the broadcast, did not desire to engage in fratricidal strife and shed blood needlessly in a civil war, but, in the face of these deliberate onslaughts, it had no other choice but to defend its hard-won liberty to the last man. According to the Minister for War, who gave the British Military Attache the above information, these events have caused high words between himseli and the Persian Prime Minister at a recent Cabinet meeting. The Prime Minister complained that those armed clashes were impeding the progress of his negotiations with the Azezbaijan Government and peevishly asPed the Minister for War why he was unable to restrain his forces from such ill-timed offensive action. The Minister for War replied, with some heat, that instructions to abstain from any aggressive action had already been sent at the Prime Minister’s request to the G.O.C. Kurdistan that these instructions had been scrupulously carried out and that in none of the three instances mentioned above was the Persian army the aggressor. He also made the suggestion of sending a mixed commission to enquire into the responsibility for the recent clashes and to prevent their recurrence. This suggestion has now been adopted. Three representatives of the Azerbaijan Government, three Persian army officers and three Kurds have been selected. The Azerbaijan representatives (whose names are given in the press as Padgan, Habibullah and Ibrahim Alizadeh and in a Persian Government communique as Jandat, Alizadeh and Azerbadegan) have already arrived in Kurdistan after a meeting with the Persian Prime Minister in Tehran. The three Persian officers (Colonels Shahrukhshahi, Pezechian and Maghruri) have also left for Kurdistan. The three Kurdish representatives will arrive there very soon. General Hajali Razmara (F.O. 189; M.A. 243) who has succeeded General Amanullah Jehanbani as Inspector-General of the Western army, will also assist the commission in its task. He is believed to favour the division of the “front” into three sectors, viz., Main Bulagh- Saqqiz : Saqqiz-Sardasht and Sardasht-Baneh and also the establishment of a no-man’s land of 2 kilom. in depth. Khorasan. 9. A report, from a trustworthy source but as yet unconfirmed by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, states that great anxiety is felt in the fertile area of Sarakhs (36° 30' N; 61° 4' E) over the cessation of the flow of water in the Tejend river which, entering Persian territory from Russia, forms the boundary for about 100 miles down to the point where tihe frontiers of Persia, Russia and Afghanistan meet. The drying-up of the river is due, the report states, to the construction of a canal by the Russians on the higher reaches which takes off all the water for the irrigation of a large area inside Russian territory. The Sarakhs district used to provide between 1,500 and 2,000 tons of wheat yearly and the loss of this will dislocate seriously the grain situation of Khorasan besides reducing to starvation the Baluch population of the area. Khuzistan. 10. The strike in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s field at Agha Jari continues, and is being made much of in the Left-wing press. The Persian Prime Minister has despatched a commission to try and settle the differences between the company and the workers. It comprises the following :— Dr. Malik Ismail, Public Prosecutor of Ustans Nos. 1 and 2, representing the Ministry of Justice; Mr Thaqafi, Director-General of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry; Mr. Hussain Amiz, the Inspector-General of the Ministry of Justice, and Mr. Khunsari, representing the Prime Minister. This commission has recommended (i) that labour should return to work at Ao'ha Jari on the 25th May, (ii) that since the strike began before the passing of the new Labour Law (passed by the Council of Ministers on the 18th May— its text is not yet available) the company should consider the strike as having occurred in exceptional circumstances and treat the strikers sympathetically by makin°' an ex gratia payment to them for the period of the strike, (m) that the proposals in (ii) above should be put to the workers two days after they have returned to work, (iv) the commission will investigate the Anglo-Iraman Oil Company’s complaints about the activities of certain agitators and. if considered necessary, the commission will recommend their expulsion, (v) after the strikers’ return to work the company will examine the new Labour Law m4 conjunction with the commission and will consider ways and means of implementing it. Persian Army. 11 . Greneral Yazdanpanah, one of the three hi^h ranking officers selected to accompany the Persian army contingent to attend the Victory Celebrations in London, left Tehran by the B.O.A.C. service on the 23rd May. His departure ^ was delayed by the insistence on taking with him to London, for medical treat ment, his small son for whose passage special sanction had to be obtained from the Foreign Office. He was accompanied by a staff officer, Colonel Mahmud Amini. General Razmara, the third high ranking officer, whose departure had been delayed by his insistence that his wife should accompany him, did not. in the end, proceed, as on the day before he was due to start he was appointed to a new post in Kurdistan (see paragraph 8 above). A ppointments. 12. —(i) Ghulam Husein Miftah to be Assistant Governor-General of the 10th L T stan and Mayor of Isfahan; (ii) Ali Akbar Assadi to be Assistant Governor-General of Khorasan. He is a brother of Salman Asadi (F.O. 33 ; M.A. 40). Communications. 13. Further serious floods have occurred in Khuzistan and both the road and railway between Khorramshahr and Ahwaz are reported to be under water. P.S.—Reference paragraph 10 above.

Persian Affairs. Political. AN official communique by the Persian Government states that Husein Ala, while remaining Persia’s Ambassador at Washington, has been relieved of his duties as Persian representative on the Security Council of U.N.O. 2. The delegation which was to proceed to Tabriz to continue the negotia tions between the Central Government and the Azerbaijan Government (see paragraph 3 of last Intelligence Summary) has not yet left. The Persian Prime Minister is reported to have said that he has detected of late a more conciliatory tone in Pishevari’s utterances. 3. There are some rumours-—they amount to nothing more for the moment —to the effect that Qawam-us-Saltaneh intends to make some changes in his Cabinet. It is well known that the Russians, and hence the Tudeh, were bitterly opposed to the selection of General Ahmedi as Minister for War and have never ceased to attack him ever since. Qawam-us-Saltaneh was forced to accept him when forming his Cabinet in order to allay the suspicions of the Extreme Right. With the arrest of most of the Right-wing politicians, and with the adoption of an openly Leftist policy by the Government, this reason no longer holds good and many foresee the replacement of General Ahmedi by either General Hidayet or General Razmara, either of whom would be acceptable to the Russians. Dr. Iqbal, the Minister for Health, who has ventured to side with General Ahmedi in opposing the present policy, is another Minister likely to disappear. Bayat, the Minister of Finance, whose dull brain has just grasped the trend of Qawam’s present policy, has been alarmed at the project for the Division of Crown Lands (referred to in paragraph 4 below) and sees in this the ultimate disappearance of such part of his once vast estates which remain after years of unsuccessful gambling. He has begun to side against Qawam and will therefore probably be discarded. 4. The Council of Ministers at their meeting on the 27th May published a decree ordering the Minister of AgrLulture to prepare a plan for the division of Crown Lands among the peasantry. Many consider that this is only a piece of political window dressing designed to secure further support for Government by the Tudeh, and they point out the great difficulties which such a project must encounter—difficulties which the Cabinet, in true Persian style, either has not considered or has airily brushed aside. Such is the provision, in future, by an impoverished peasantry instead of, as hitherto, by a wealthy landlord of seed, animals, tools and water. The land-owning class are greatly perturbed by this decree for they gloomily predict that division of Crown Lands among the peasantry must inevitably lead to a similar division of private estates. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 5. An unconfirmed report states that anti-Democrat risings have occurred in Rezaiyeh. There is some evidence to show that the unpopularity of the Democrat regime in Azerbaijan is on the increase. The Azerbaijan Government is high handed in its methods. Under the former Persian Administration taxes could be evaded by the payment of a suitable bribe, but the present regime is reported to be savage in its methods of collecting a tax more severe than any previously levied. Conscription could usually be avoided under the Persian Administration by suitable payments, whereas the present Government is vigilant in its combing out of the villages and in inflicting severe punishment on those who fail to report or who desert after enrolment. These signs, however, in no [78—82]way justify the optimistic view held by many Persians in the capital that Azerbaijan is seething with discontent, and that one forward step by the army in the direction of Azerbaijan will suffice to fan this revolt into open flame and drive the Democrats across the Aras River. 6 . As the result of a request by the Persian Prime Minister to Pishevari the following officers have been liberated from prison (where they were serving sentences imposed by the Azerbaijan Government) and sent back to Tehran :— Colonel Baharvand, formerly Chief of the Military Police of Azerbaijan.^^ Colonel Zanganeh, formerly Brigade Commander at Rezaiyeh. Colonel Nurbaksh, formerly Chief of Staff at Rezaiyeh. Kurdistan. 7. Yet another clash between the Kurds and the Persian army occurred on the 26th May near Sardasht, as a result of which the military lost an officer and four other ranks wounded. x\gain, according to the Minister for War, it was the Kurds who started the fight. According to General Ahmedi a comic element was introduced into the proceedings by the arrival on the scene during the skirmish of the three Kurdish representatives referred to in paragraph 8 of last Intelligence Summary. The lorry in which they were travelling was heavily fired upon by the Kurds themselves who mistook their representatives for the enemy. Only a well-aimed round of gun fire saved the situation by causing the Kurdish irregulars to scatter and enabling the Kurdish representatives to establish their identity. Khorasan. 8 . His Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, reports that anti-British propaganda by the Tudeh party by means of the press and radio is on the increase in Meshed and in the surrounding villages. Tudeh activity in Kashmar and Turbat-i-Haidari, he reports as the result of a recent visit to these places, is practically nil. Many more Russians have been noticed in Meshed recently. Gurgan. 9. Some clashes have occurred between the Persian army battalion recently sent to Gurgan and some Turcoman tribesmen who. profiting by the interval between the departure of the Russian troops and the arrival of the Persian battalion, had started to pillage the countryside. Fars. 10. A report, which comes from the family of Qawam-ul-Mulk and which will require confirmation since they are the aggrieved party, states that Khosro Qashgai has prevailed upon the Persian Prime Minister, through Muzaffar Firuz, to appoint Nasir Khan as Security Officer for the districts of Lar, Fasa and Jahrum, districts in which hitherto the influence of Qawam-ul-Mulk has been paramount. The same source states that Khosro also attempted to have placed under Nasir Khan the Khamseh tribes of which Qawam-ul-Mulk is the hereditary chief, though not himself a member of those tribes. For himself Khosro attempted to have created the new appointment of “Special Inspector of the South ’’ under which ill-defined title he would have a finger in every pie. The newspaper Mihr-i-lran published the following :— . “ As is well known during the former regime the property of the Qashgai family was unjustly confiscated and illegal interference took place in its transfer and distribution; we are, therefore, happy to learn that the Prime Minister has appointed a special committee to study this matter, and deal with the legitimate grievances of the family. In this connexion we recall that the Qashgai brothers are among the first big landlords to modify substantially in favour of their tenants the Land lords’ shares in the cultivators’ crops.” There would be plenty of Persians who would say that the “legitimate grievances ” are on the other side and that Nasir Khan would find it difficult to justify his title to much of the land now in his possession. While in Tehran Khosro and his brother Muhammad Husein have been in close and almost daily contact with the Tudeh party and, through them, with the Russian Embassy. Nasir Khan has caused some excitement by the despateh of a telegram to the Persian Government in which he deplored the attacks made by the Persian armv on his brothers the Democrats, and called for the condign punishment of the Minister responsible, by which, presumably, the Minister for War is intendedA ppointments. 11. Durri to be counsellor of the Persian Embassy in Moscow. He accompanied Qawam-us-Saltaneh on his mission to Moscow. He was a Deputy in the last Majlis, being re-elected by Tudeh insistence after his credentials had at first been rejected. The Press. 12 . Reference was made in last week’s Intelligence Summary to the increasingly anti-British tone in the local press. Two specimens are given below :— (i) Hundreds of times the B.B.C. has published false and provocative reports concerning Persia. This policy was taken up by other radios like the Angora and Delhi radio which were the instrument of London policy. It was regrettable that the politicians on the banks of the Thames did not want to alter their old policy and use means other than falsehood and intrigue to achieve their aim and suck the blood of the weak and oppressed Eastern countries. The former British Government had not hesitated to commit all sorts of cruelties on weak countries in order to secure its imperialist aims and the Labour Government followed the same policy. The Persian people and Government should be aware of the intrigues of foreigners to create civil war. Rahbar —28£A May, 1946. (ii) Letter to the editor claims that a writer had once visited A.I.O.C. in Abadan and seen a British captain, whom he had seen formerly in Shaiba working in civilian clothes. On asking him whether there were other officers also with him, he had answered no. But the writer had enquired and at New Construction had seen three Indian squadrons stationed in the newly-constructed houses. Editorial comment states that the hirelings of imperialism should be asked why they kept silence concerning the officers and soldiers who were in the A.I.O.C. in civilian clothes, and concerning the transfer of British ammunition from Basra and other places in Iraq to the A.I.O.C. British Interests. 13. A parliamentary delegation of three is to arrive shortly in Abadan to study the situation which has arisen out of the recent strikes in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concessional area. 14. His Majesty’s Ambassador visited Abadan and some of the oil-fields between the 31st May and the 3rd June. Russian Interests. 15. According to the Protocol Department of the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Russians have forced the Persian Government to allow them to reopen their consulate at Shiraz, which has been closed for many years.

Persian Affairs. Political. . . The Persian Prime Minister is reliably reported as saying that he is confident of bringing the negotiations between his Government and the Go\ei n- ment of Azerbaijan to a successful conclusion within a few days. There are grounds for believing that he proposes to include one or two of the Azerbaija representatives in his Cabinet. To the fact that the Russians all the time have been working to this end Qawam turns a conveniently blind eye and blandly observes that a little responsibility will soon sober these Azerbaijani extremists. He will soon realise that he has caught a Tartar or, as the Persians would say, they will breakfast off him before he sups off them. , 2. A curious official communique has been issued by the Propaganda Department, which is in the charge of Muzaffar Firuz. It states that recently in certain sections of the press certain reforms undertaken by the Persian Government have been attributed to certain Ministers or to certain political parties. The communique denies the truth of these allegations and informs the public that all these reforms have been undertaken on the orders of the Prime Minister It goes on to state that the constructive activity and reforming zeal on the part of the Cabinet are due to the energy and perseverance of Qawam-us- Saltaneh. The idea of collective Cabinet responsibility has never been loudly proclaimed in Persia either before or after Reza Shah’s regime, but the- communique above is curious nevertheless. While Muzaffar Firuz s slavish adherence to Qawam-us-Saltaneh would naturally prompt him to glorify his chief as the leading reformer and the driving force in Persia to-day, one would have thought that Qawam’s natural caution would have urged him to stress the collective responsibility of himself and his colleagues for acts and policies which may later be the subject of sharp criticism or which might conceivably be made the grounds for his impeachment. . 3 . At their meeting of the 5 th June the Council of Ministers decreed that a sum of 6 million rials be placed at the disposal of the Ministry of the Interioi for defraying expenses in connexion with the next elections. 4 The interrogation of Seyyid Zia-ud-Din began on the 1st June. fi’ On the 3 rd June a one-day strike among the employees of the Anglo- I rani an Oil Company in Tehran occurred. The strike, it is said, was out of protest against disciplinary action taken against some mechanics. All depots and filling stations were closed. A continuance of the strike would have paralysed the transport, lighting, bread supplies and public baths of the capital and the Persian Prime Minister is reliably reported as having told the Tudeh party to call off the strike. Internal Security. Kw'distan. 6 . A further clash has been reported during the past week between the Kurds and the Persian army between Saqqiz and Sardasht. No details are as yet known. General Razmara and the tripartite commission referred to in paragraph 7 of last Intelligence Summary have not been successful, so far, in delimiting the neutral zone and in withdrawing the opposing forces to positions in rear of it. According to an officer on General Razmara’s staff (who gave the information to His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah), the general is apprehensive [78—101]over the recent movement into Persia of some 3,000 to 4,000 Suleiman Jaf horsemen. (This figure, especially in relation to tribal irregular cavalry m a mountainous region producing little in the way of supplies, would appear to be an exaggeration.) They are said, by the same source, to have crossed the frontier at Merivan, where they made contact with the Kani Senani and Avroman lakht tribes and with the Kurds from the Mahabad district. General Razmara fears that they may make a drive across to Tikab, on the eastern extremity of his—^ “ front,” join up with the Democrat rebel forces and attack the Gulbaghi, witfr whom they have old scores to settle. Such a move would, of course, cut off the whole of the Persian army garrisons in the Saqqiz, Baneh and Sardasht areas, which number about 35,000 men. A zerbaijan. 7. Tabriz Radio, on the 31st May, announced that a meeting of repre sentatives of the Democrat party from all towns in Azerbaijan had adopted a twelve-point resolution which included the following :— Full approval of the reforms undertaken by the party regime. Agree ment to the resumption of negotiations with the Central Government. Co-operation with democratic movements in other parts of Persia to the end that democracy may be fully established throughout the country and that worthy representatives may be elected to the next Majlis. 8 . Though the reports of anti-Democrat risings in Rezaiyeh (referred to in paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary) are believed to have been exaggerated, they were nevertheless sufficiently serious to cause the Azerbaijan Government some concern and to result in the despatch of Pishevari, Biriya and the Minister of Justice to investigate them. 9. Six officers and thirteen men of the People’s army are said to have been arrested in Tabriz on suspicion of anti-Democrat activities. 10 . His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General reports that, since the 6 th June, the Armenian Emigration Committee has been issuing daily lists of fifty names of selected immigrants into Soviet Armenia. Those named must report to the .committee with their identity papers and photographs. It is understood that they will be provided with Soviet passports and leave immediately. Khorasan. 11 . His Majesty’s Consul-General reports that the Berberis, who have hitherto shown little interest in politics, are forming a society with a religious and political background with a view to securing the election of a Berberi to the next Majlis. They are said to have approached the Persian Prime Minister in this connexion. The Tudeh party has, hitherto, always accused them of being servants of the British, but Tudeh emissaries sent recently to the Akhlamad area are said to have been given a favourable reception. Khuzistan. 12. The situation in Abadan and Agha Jari, though quiet on the surface, is extremely precarious. The Tudeh party are in complete control of labour at the refinery and are gaining ground in the fields. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's management exists only on sufferance. At any moment, for any reason, a strike could be called which would bring production to a standstill. Hitherto the Tudeh leaders have used their power to main tain order. Although inciting to violence in theory they have discouraged it in practice. The Tudeh party have constituted themselves the de facto represen tatives of labour in Persia and the management is discussing with them, in that capacity, the organisation of the trade unions contemplated under the new Labour Law (referred to in paragraph 10 of Intelligence Summary No. 20 ). By doing so the company can maintain some sort of contact with the representa tives of labour and production in the fields, but few will believe that such a course of action will result in anything more than a short respite. In their present mood of subservience to the Tudeh it is extremely unlikely that the Persian Government will issue adequate instructions to their local officials to maintain order or that they will back them up if they act on their own.A p'pointments. 13.

On the 3rd June the Chinese Ambassador presented to His Imperial Majesty the Shah, on behalf of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the order of the “ Blessed Cloud,' described in the Persian press as “the highest Chinese decoration.” % The Persian Army. 15. Ever since the abdication of Reza Shah, the Persian army has had a had press. Attacks have been made on its venality, inefficiency, low morale, high cost, maladministration, and the political tendencies of its officers. These attacks have grown more violent of late and have reached such a pitch that, in the opinion of the Minister of War, discipline has been completely undermined. Till recently the Persian Prime Minister and his Cabinet have been deaf to General Ahmedi's appeals to stop this campaign of slander. Last week, as the result of further representations by him, Qawam-us-Saltaneh issued the following official communiqud:— For some time it has been observed that certain undesirable statements about the current affairs of the army have appeared in certain newspapers, statements which I deplore. On repeated occasions I have warned the majority of newspaper owners that the pursuance of such a policy is bound not only to shake the morale of the army and discourage both officers and men, but to constitute a danger to the country whose peace and welfare depends upon the maintenance of discipline in the army and the preserva tion of the honour and prestige of the army’s faithful and patriotic officers, and that such a policy will lead to highly undesirable and disastrous results. As I am paying special attention to the army and am taking a keen interest in reforms, and as I consider it necessary to encourage and promote loyal and patriotic officers, I am not prepared to tolerate the slightest insult to the army in the press. “It is obvious that I shall not deprive journalists of their legitimate right to criticise and raise questions should mistakes occur in army affairs which justify criticism. I shall, however, carefully examine the contents of newspapers and by putting a stop to insults and slander I hope, and intend, to see that the prestige of the army is completely preserved. I am cer tain that with the reforms which I propose to put through the friendship and popularity of the army with the people of the nation will daily increase, and that officers and men will be encouraged to render ever-increasing services to the country.” (Signed) Qawam-us-Saltaneh. Public Health. 16. In the course of an interview with the press, the Minister of Health stated that out of 1,300 doctors and health officers in Persia 600 resided in Tehran. On these figures it would appear that the ratio of doctors to population in the capital is 1 - 1,000 and for the rest of the country 1 - 20 , 000 . Italian Interests. 17. The new Italian Minister and his staff are reported in the Persian press as having arrived in Tehran on the 1 st June. No reliable particulars as to the names of the Minister or of his staff have been published. A delay in the presentation of his letters of credence may occur as the result of the recent change of regime in Italy. Chilean Interests. 18. According to a press report M. Manuel Paton Vaquerre has arrived in Tehran as Chilean Minister. His country has not hitherto been represented in Persia.4 t! ■w - Postscript. The following additional information regarding Kurdistan was given to* the British Military Attache by the Minister for War on the 10 th June : — (i) The three Kurdish representatives on the tripartite commission have returned to their homes as the Kurdish insurgents refuse to recognise them. (ii) There seem to be two bodies each of which claims to represent tiie Kurds, i.e., Ghazi Muhammad of Mahabad, styling himself “ The Independent Government of Kurdistan,” and Hama Rashid, who calls himself “ Major-General commanding the Kurdish Forces.” (iii) The latter has sent a letter couched in threatening terms to General Razmara, in which he demands the evacuation of Sardasht, Saqqiz and Baneh by the Persian army on the grounds that these places form part of an autonomous Kurdistan.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

Political. THE commission referred to in paragraph 2 of Intelligence Summary No. 21 finally left for Tabriz on the 11 th June. It was headed by Muzaffar Firuz. A military delegation composed of General Abdullah Hidayet, Under-Secretary in the Ministry for War, and Colonel Alawi accompanied it. These two officers were nominated by Muzaffar Firuz as being “ reliable.” The Minister for War attempted to include General Kupal as his nominee, but was overruled. The selection of Muzaffar Firuz, as devoid of discretion as he is of principles, lends colour to the view r that the despatch of the commission was merely a gesture, the terms of settlement having been arrived at beforehand in Tehran, doubtless with the disinterested help of the Soviet Ambassador. The commission returned to Tehran on the 15th June, where a great ovation was arranged to celebrate the settlement of the Azerbaijan question. Subsequently a Government com munique was issued, of which a full translation will follow in next week’s Intelligence Summary. The decision to incorporate regularly enlisted men of the Azerbaijan army into the Persian army is to be implemented by a joint commission which is to assemble later. The “ Fidais ” (Democrat volunteers) are to become the Azerbaijan gendarmerie, the strength and organisation of which are likewise to be settled by a subsequent commission. These two clauses, alone, show the unsatisfactory nature of the agreement. They are the vital issues and will determine whether the Persian Government’s writ, backed up by forces under tiheir control, is to run in Azerbaijan or not. The failure to settle these points, and the general air of haste which characterises the agree ment, clearly prove that all Qawam intended was, firstly, to show U.N.O. that no Azerbaijan problem now remains, and. secondly, to claim that, as the Azerbaijan question has been settled, there was now no bar to the immediate start of the next elections. 2 . His Majesty's Ambassador recently called on the Persian Prime Minister to discuss the situation created in the south by the recent strikes and by Tudeh activities. The only other person present at the meeting was the Oriental Coun sellor, who acted as interpreter. On the 15th June the Russian paper Pravda came out with a grossly distorted version of this interview, at which His Majesty’s Ambassador was accused of trying to intimidate Qawam-us-Sultaneh, of expressing disapproval of Qawam’s rapprochement with the Tudeh, of declaring that if the Persian Government did not take the necessary measures in the south, a situation would arise which would cause the Persian Government to repent, of threatening Qawam that if the next Majlis elections took a turn unfavourable to British interests, or if Tudeh candidates were elected, His Majesty’s Ambassador would insist on Qawam’s renewing the appeal to U.N.O. and asking that body to supervise the elections. It is thought that Muwarrikh-ud-Dowleh, to whom Qawam may have given the substance of the interview, passed on a distorted version to the Soviet Ambassador, for whom he acts as a political jackal. This embassy has for long regarded him as an unreliable go-between, and Husein Ala, when Minister of Court, was so disgusted with his activities that he actually forbade him access to His Imperial Majesty the Shah. 3. At 12 noon on the 15th June an aeroplane, reliably reported as a Russian machine, flew low over Tehran dropping leaflets. The three picked up in the grounds of His Majesty’s Embassy read as follows: — (i) “ Henceforward all freedom lovers will progress in unity towards the happiness and prosperity of Persia.” [79—14](ii) “ Long live the unbreakable front of the freedom lovers of Persia. (iii) “ Azerbaijan is an indivisible part of Persia, and the good news oi tine settling of the Azerbaijan question delivers a final blow to the body of reaction.” Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 4. A list of Soviet officials in Azerbaijan, which has been compiled by Majesty’s Acting Consul-General, shows some interesting figures.. They are as follows :— (1) Tabriz.

Kurdistan. 5 . In paragraph 6 of last Intelligence Summary reference was made to an almost certainly exaggerated report of the entry into Persia of three to four thousand Suleiman Jaf horsemen. A later report from official sources in Bagdad places the number as under fifty. 6 . Muhammad Haidari, son of Mahmud Khan Dizli, according to a report received through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kermanshah, has joined the Komala and is in revolt against the Persian Government near Merivan. 7. x\ccording to the Minister for War, General Razmara is anxious not only at the increasing numbers of the Kurdish rebels facing him. but also at the universal nature of the movement which is proved by the varied assortment of.the contingents Comprising the Kurdish army. Tribes from Iraq, from practically all Persian Kurdistan and even Jalalis from near Mount Ararat, have all been identified. Khuzistan. 8 . While there is little news from the oil fields or the actual refinery area, where an uneasy calm prevails, increased Tudeh activity in Abadan and Khorram- ^ahr is reported. In Abadan the Tudeh recently threatened the tailors with torcible closure of their shops unless they became members of the party. In Khorramshahr the Tudeh summon private individuals to their headquarters and inflict fines on them for failing to obey orders. Their men, distinguished by arm bands, superintend the traffic of boats plying for hire and generally usurp the functions of the police. Appointments. 9. (i) Abbas Iskandari to be Civil Governor of Tehran vice Isa Surush. (ii) Afrasiab Nawa to be second secretary at the Persian Embassy in Kabul. (iii) Muhammad Salahi to be attache at the Persian Legation in Belgrade. (iv) Muhammad Buda to be second secretary at the Persian Consulate at Khaniqin. (v) Habibullah Nasiri to be third secretary at the Persian Consulate at Mosul. Finance. 10 . The Cabinet have approved a two-twelfths budget Bill to meet current expenditure for the months of Khurdad and Tir (the 2()th May-20th July). 11 . The Government have charged a special commission with the prepara tion of a general budget for the year 1325 (the 21st March, 1946-20th March, 1947) so that it may be ready for presentation to the Fifteenth Majlis when it is convened.

Doctors Qasim Ghani, Seyyid Ahmad Imami and Muhammad Husein Hafizi have been chosen to represent Persia at the International Health Con ference due to open in New York on the 19th June. These three are all in America at present. Dr. Avery, adviser to the Ministry of Health, has been appointed technical adviser to the delegation. Communications. 14. The Council of Ministers have sanctioned a sum of 2 million rials for the asphalting of the roads Tehran-Qum and Tehran-Qazvin. 15. Some railway technicians accompanied the delegation to Azerbaijan (see paragraph 1 above). They are to take over from the Russians the railway line from Tabriz-Julfa. 16. The town of Khorramshahr is not yet out of danger from the flooding of the Shatt-el-Arab and Karun Rivers. Malaria is rife, and there is fear of an outbreak of typhus.' ***' ' ' V m SECRET THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. SECRET. July 3, 1946. Section 1.

Persian Affairs. Political. A translation of the Persian Government’s communique referred to in paragraph 1 of last Intelligence Summary is given as an appendix to this Summary. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General in Tabriz reports that there are signs that the agreement between the Central Government and the Azerbaijan Government has caused a split in the ranks of the Demoeiat there. eie is an unconfirmed report of an attempt on the life of Jaafar Pishevan. Gnu am Reza Ilhami, the Minister of Finance, and Muhammad Biriya, the Minister oi Education in the Azerbaijan Government, who represent the Extreme Lett and who have always stood out for complete independence, are dissatisfied with the agreement. The present Government of Azerbaijan is weak and muddle-headed. Dr Javid the new Governor-General, is not the man to improve it, as, apart from being dishonest and stupid, he has no influence over the Democrat 1 arty or its “ Fidais” (volunteer forces). * ^ r&gt; • 2. Muzaffar Firuz, the Political Under-Secretary of State in the leisian Prime Minister’s office, in an interview with the press on his return from Tabriz, gave the following replies to questions : (i) That Dr. Salamullah Javid had been appointed Governor-General of Azerbaijan. . ri , , (ii) That, for the present, Mr. Pishevari occupies no Government post. (iii) That’the elections would begin shortly. There is a rumour that they have been postponed for two months, some say at the insistence of the Tudeh Party, which feels that its pieparations aie incomplete.) . , ^ . i (iv) That all Allied forces, British, American and Russian, have complete!) evacuated Persia (in answer to a question about the alleged con tinuance of the occupation of Bushire by British troops). (v) That it was quite untrue that the newspapers of the Right had been suppressed. . .i (vi) That the reason for the suppression of certain newspapers was the publication by them of articles calculated to embarrass the relations between the Persian Government and foreign Powers. ( Y H) That the Government was considering the adoption of a new name tor the gendarmerie. (Note. —Colonel Schwarzkopf, in con\ersation with the British Military Attache, said that, at a meeting held to discuss the new appellation, in which the Persian Government representati\es could think of no suitable title, he felt some pride, as an American in finding a word which was instantly accepted. The name selected was “ nigger band.” This surprising word is thought to be Colonel Schwarzkopf’s version of “ nigahban a watchman.) fviiii That the Azerbaijan Government’s bank notes had never been current V in Azerbaijan nor had they been observed in use in shops. (Note. — This statement was incorrect.) . . . , , (ix) That a new law granting votes to women would be laid before the 15th Majlis when elected!. , , o (x) That a new law increasing the number of Deputies m ratio to electors V would also be laid before the next Majlis. [79—65] B(xi) That the liberation of Seyyid Zia-uci-Din and others arrested at the same time was a matter for the legal authorities and competent tribunals. (xii) That he, Muzaffar Firuz, had been fortunate enough to secure agree ment on the most ticklish question of all, namely, the evacuation by the Democrats of the Province of Khamseh (capital, Zenjan), which, though no part of Azerbaijan but forming part of the 1st and 2 nd Ustans, had been occupied by them for the past six months.^^ (Note .—Muzaffar Firuz’s jubilation is premature, for Pishevari, in a speech in Tabriz on the 17th June to the Democrat Party, declared that he was not satisfied over this point. The Persian Prime Minister had assured him that rhe exclusion of Khamseh from Azerbaijan was only a temporary measure. He could not agree even to that and said that the Azerbaijan Government would continue to treat Khamseh as part of Azerbaijan and would continue to maintain order there by means of their volunteer forces (“ Fidais ”).) 3. The Persian Prime Minister has sent a circular telegram to all Governors-General instructing them to change at once all town mayors and district governors (“ Bakshdars ”) who have been in their present posts for more than one year. The reason given is that it is desirable that impartial officials should hold these posts during the next elections. It will be interesting to see just how long it takes the new incumbents to size up the election situation and to make their dispositions to ensure a steady income from both sides. Internal Security. A zerbciijan. 4. The Azerbaijan Provincial Council has requested the Ministry of the Interior to allot a sum of 23 million rials for reforms to be undertaken in eastern and western Azerbaijan. Taking into consideration the former allot ments to Azerbaijan, however, the Ministry of the Interior have approved a loan from the National Bank of 8 million rials to be placed at the disposal of the Governor-General of Azerbaijan. Kurdistan. 5. According to the Minister for War, the recent fighting lasted about ten days and ceased, for the moment at least, on the 20th June. In their attacks on Saqqiz the Kurds appear to have lost heavily—General Razmara estimating their losses at over 200 in killed and wounded. Ghazi Muhammad of Mahabad, who has met General Razmara and is expected to arrive in Tehran shortly, denies that his followers have broken the recently made truce and asserts that the assailants of Saqqiz were either the followers of Hama Rashid or of Mulla Mustafa Barzani, i.e., Iraqi Kurds in either case. General Razmam has also arrived in Tehran for “ consultations,” though his visit may be in connexion with the vacant appointment of Chief of the General Staff (see paragraph 18 below). Hamadan. 6 . By the end of May all resistance to the Democrats by the Government partisans had petered out. As previously stated (paragraph 6 of Intelligence Summary No. 14), the reasons were the cessation of support in arms and ammu nition from the capital, jealousies among the leaders and the seasonal demands of agriculture. Hidayetullah Yamini has disbanded his followers and the Zulfiqaris followed suit and retired to Hamadan, thus leaving open the road to Bijar. The Democrat forces appear to be based on Zarinabad, from whence they pillage the surrounding countryside, dividing up amongst themselves all mov able property. K ho ms an. 7. His Majesty’s Consul-General reports that the Russians have been making heavy purchases of sheep and goats for export to Russia. The deal is said to have been concluded through a Jew and the figures given are as high as 60,000. Local religious opinion has been roused against this depletion of Persia’s livestock. 8 . Local propaganda by the Tudeh for the next elections is in full blast. It is anti-British and anti-American in tone.3 9. Security has not improved, and on or about the 15th June five passenger buses on their way to Tehran from Meshed were held up and looted near Sabzawar. Khuzistan. 10. It was reported in the Tehran press that the newly formed Provincial Council of Khuzistan at Ahwaz had transmitted to the Central Government in Tehran a resolution requesting that the province should be given the same privileges that have been granted to Azerbaijan. It is not known to what extent the “ Saadat ” Party (who seem to have a majority in the Khuzistan Provincial Council) are the sponsors of this request or whether the Arabs (who recently approached His Majesty’s Consul at Khorramshahr to enquire what should be their attitude to Tudeh infiltration) are the prime movers. Hitherto the Azer baijan Democrats (in order to prove that they favoured no separatist movement) and the Tudeh both strongly advocated the formation of Provincial Councils throughout Persia and claimed that the reforms which they demanded for Azerbaijan should also be given to the rest of Persia. It is not expected, however, that their approval will extend to movements sponsored by adherents of other parties even though the professed aims be identical. 11 . No further news of disturbances in the A.I.O.C. concessional area has been received, but an interesting development in the dispute between the company and its labour is the attendance at a Tudeh meeting on the 16th June in Abadan of about 200 Indian artisans. 12. A commission comprising Aramish, Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Commerce and Mines, Saqavi and Kaviani has left for Abadan in order to implement the recently passed Labour Law. Kaviani will remain in Abadan as the Labour representative of the Persian Government. 13. The Governor-General of Khuzistan has arrived in Tehran for consul tations with the Persian Prime Minister. He intends to ask for stronger support and more definite instructions from the Central Government in his task of main taining order in his province. . 14. The Russian Consul-General and Vice-Consul from Ahwaz recently visited Khorramshahr and made detailed enquiries from the Governor as to British activities and the attitude of the Arab Sheikhs towards the Tudeh. Appoint men ts. 15 .—(i) Abbas Forouhar (F.O. 69) to be Persian Minister to Yugoslavia. (ii) Dr Salamullah Javid to be Governor-General of Ustans 3 and 4 (eastern and western Azerbaijan). He was Minister of the Interior in the Azerbaijan Government. Little is known of his past. He is belie\ed to be a Je^ fiom Meshed. The Court. 16. Princess Ashraf is to visit Moscow shortly at the in’s itation of the Soviet Red Cross to inspect their organisations in Russia. In conversation with His Roval Highness Prince Peter of Greece, now on his way through Persia to Afghanistan Princess Ashraf stated that she was apprehensive about the safety of the Pahlevi dvnasty and thought that the establishment of more cordial relations with the Soviet Government might partially dispel their hostility to Reza Shah’s descendants.

V- + 1 - 10 + /or General Razmara or Later he expressed [79—65] General Abdullah Hidayet as Chief of the General Staff, a strong preference for the former. This placed His b 24 Imperial Majesty the Shah in a difficult position, since he mistrusts General Razmara and yet did not feel strong enough to refuse Qawam-us-Saltaneh s choice in an appointment for which, as titular commander-in-chief of the army, he felt he should have the right to make his own selection or, at least, to turn down the appointment of an officer whose loyalty was doubtful. 19. The following promotions are published in the press : Sartip Abdullah Hidayet, Under-Secretary of State for War (F.O. 81 to be Sarlashgar. ^ Sartip Kupal, President of Military Tribunal (F.O. 114; M.A. 155), to be Sarlashgar. . sub jet Sarhang Garzan, Assistant Chief of the General Staff, to be Sartip.

The negotiations, which had been proceeding since the 10 th June between the Persian Government representatives and Brigadier Costeloe, repre senting the War Office, for a settlement of the claims arising out of war-time Allied traffic over the Iranian State Railway, have resulted in a deadlock. Ihe negotiations took place on the basis of a formula known as ' A.B.C.’ in which “A” represented the shortfall between revenue and expenditure, “ B repre sented non-accounts charges, such as depreciation, and “ C represented the profit which was to accrue to the Persian Government. The figures proposed by the British representatives under the three headings were, respectively, (in million of ri^ls) 1,398, 470 and 153, total 2,021. The British credits for cash supplied and stores (consumed but not paid for) totalled 1,842, leaving a balance due to the Persian Government of 179. Against this was to be set the sums due by the Persian Government for stores taken over and fixed assets purchased which amount to approximately 206, thus leaving a final balance due to the British of approximately 27. The Persian claim has been discussed on a technical level as long ago as January 1946 and had formed the basis of the above formula and proposals. Although the Persian Government had been pressing for the start of the negotiations, their formal claim was not produced till the'l 5 th June and was explained at a meeting on the 16th June. It seemed to bear no relation to any known facts or figures and was too fantastic to merit serious discussion. Their figures, under the three heads ‘‘A,' “ B ' and “ C,” were (in million of rials) 1,400, 1,160 and 1.728, making a total of 4,288. The net result of these figures would have meant that instead of owing the British 27 million rials they claimed from the British 240 million rials or, roughly, £20 million. The immense inflation of their claim was due chiefly to a demand for a profit of 7 per cent., to their doubling the original cost of construc tion of the railway to allow for the depreciation of the rial and increased replacement costs and to the inclusion under head “B' of some claims of doubtful validity. American Interests. 21. Colonel Joseph K. Baker has been succeeded as American Military Attache by Colonel William T. Sexton, Field Artillery, United States army. Colonel Sexton served with the United States Third Army and was for a time, a personal assistant to General Marshall. Chilean Interests. 22 . Corrigendum to paragraph 18 of Intelligence Summary No. 22. The name of the new Chilean Minister was wrongly given in the Persian press. It should read as Manuel Garreton. He is also accredited to Turkey. Chinese Interests. 23. His Excellency Li Tieh-tseng, Chinese Minister in Persia from June 1942 and ambassador from May 1945, is leaving this week on transfer. He states that he is to open a new embassy in Siam.

An agreement has been concluded as a result of the conversations which have taxen place between the Government and the Azerbaijan deleg*ates on the subject of the seven articles of the communique of the 2nd Ordibehesht, 1325 (22nd April, 1946) (published as an appendix to M.A.’s Intelligence Summary No. 16, dated the 28th April, 1946), which was accepted by these delegates. The agreement comprised the following points which explain and amplify the previous communique and which will be read in conjunction with it. 1. It was agreed that the following phrase should be added to the context of the existing first article of the Government communiqud: — “ The Director of Finance also will be appointed on the nomination of the Provincial Council subject to the approval of the Government.” {A rticle 1 of the original communique: The directors of agriculture, commerce, industry and mines, local transport, education, public health, police, the departments of public prosecutors and magistrates, and of financial control will be chosen by the Provincial and District Councils and their appointment according to the regulations will be communicated to them by the Tehran Government.) 2 . It was agreed in article 2 of the Government communique that the Governor-General would be appointed by the Government after consultation with the Provincial Council. In order to apply this principle the Ministry of the Interior will submit to the Government the name of a Governor-General chosen from a list of nominees put up by the Provincial Council. (Ar ‘tide 2 of the original communique: The nomination of the Governor-General lies with the Government, prior agreement having been attained from the Provincial Council. The nomination of commanders for the military and gendarmerie forces is the responsibility of the Government.) 3. The Government, taking into consideration recent developments in Azerbaijan, will recognise as the Provincial Council the existing organisation as already set up and convened under the name of the “ Azerbaijan National Assembly.' After the assembly of the Fifteenth Legislature and the approval of the new law relating to provincial and district councils, which will be put forward by the Government, an immediate start will be made on the election of the Azerbaijan Provincial Council in conformity with that law. 4. It was agreed that a commission would be set up to decide on the disposal of the local forces and their commanders w T hich were called to the colours for com pulsory military service under the orders of the Azerbaijan movement, and which, consequent on the signing of this agreement, are considered as forming part of the Iranian forces. This commission will be composed of representatives of the Government of his Excellency M. Qawam-us-Saltaneh and of the Azerbaijan Provincial Council and will assemble on the spot and submit proposals as early as possible for the solution of this problem. 5. With regard to the financial situation of Azerbaijan, it was decided that 75 per cent, of the revenues of Azerbaijan would be allotted to local expenditure and 25 per cent, remitted to the capital for expenditure within the remainder of the country. Footnote 1.—Revenue and expenditure of Posts and Telegraphs, of Customs and Railways, and of shipping on Lake Urumiyeh are excepted. The revenue and expenditure of these will accrue to, and be defrayed by, the Government. It is laid down that telegrams of the provincial and district councils, as well as those of State services, will be transmitted free of charge. Footnote 2.—The construction and maintenance of the principal motor routes will be the responsibility of the Government, but that of secondary or local routes will be the responsibility of the Azerbaijan Provincial Council. Footnote 3.—In order to pav homage to the brilliant service rendered by . Azerbaijan to the Constitution and in recognition of the sacrifices made by theti courageous population of Azerbaijan in the establishment of democracy, it is- agreed that 25 per cent, of customs revenue will be allotted to the Azerbaijan University. 6 . The Government undertakes to begin as early as possible, and to complete with the minimum of delay, the extension of the railway line between Mianeh and Tabriz. It is self-evident that Azerbaijani technicians and labourers will have first consideration. ^ 7. The voluntary forces, excepting those which were called to the colours obligatory military service, will be transferred to the gendarmerie. It was decided to convene a commission composed of representatives of the Government of his Excellency M. Qawam-us-Saltaneh and of the Azerbaijan Provincial Council in order to submit as early as possible a solution to the question of the future of these security forces. Footnote 1 .—'Since, during the course of the past few year and in consequence of certain activities, the name “ gendarmerie ' nas caused feelings of hatred in Persian public opinion, especially so in that of Azerbaijan; and since, on the other hand, the head of the Government has recently taken upon himself the command of this force, which presages reforms and a clean-up within the service, it was decided that the wishes of public opinion and, in particular, those prevalent in Azerbaijan, with regard to the gendarmerie would be brought to the notice of the Government so that decisions may be made modifying the name of this force. 8 . With regard to the division of properties amongst the peasants of Azer baijan by the Democratic Movement, in so far as such properties belong to the State, and the Government having given its agreement to the principle of the division of the propertied wealth among the peasants throughout the territory, there is no obstacle to the realisation of these measures within Azerbaijan. The Government will place proposals to this effect with the minimum of delay before Parliament. But, in so far as estates belonging to third parties have been divided among the peasants in consequence of recent events, it has been decided that a commission, which will be composed of representatives of the Government of his Excellency M. Qawam-us-Saltaneh and of the Azerbaijan Provincial Council, will be set up to find a solution to the question and to recompense the owners or to give them other estates in exchange. 9. The Government agrees to the necessity of drafting and of tabling with a recommendation of urgency, after the assembly of the Fifteenth Legislature, a Bill for an electoral law based on liberal and democratic principles, which will ensure a suffrage which is universal, secret, direct, proportional and equal for all and which will include women. As soon as the Fifteenth Legislature assembles, the Government will, in addition, table a Bill with a recommendation of double urgency for a law to increase the number of representatives to be elected from Azerbaijan and other parts of the country in proportion to their population, with a proviso that the remaining Deputies, after this law has been passed, may be elected and sent to the Majlis. 10 . The province of Azerbaijan will comprise the third and fourth Ustans. 11 . The Government, in order to assure the satisfactory progress of affairs in Azerbaijan, agrees to convene an administrative council, compcsed of the Governor-General, the directors of the various services and of the committee of the Provincial Council, which will carry out its task under the direction of the Provincial Council. 12. Article 3 of the Government communique of the 2nd Ordibehosht. 1325 (22nd April, 1946), is not sufficiently detailed about colleges and high-grade schools; and therefore the following paragraph is added to it :— “ Courses in college and higher-grade schools will be carried out in the Persian and Azerbaijani tongues in conformity with the programme of the Minister of Education, keeping under consideration circumstances of time and place and conforming to the principles of the democrats and new progressives.” (Article 3 of the original communique — The official language of Azerbaijan will be Persian, as in other parts of the country. All administrative and judicial office work will be in Persian and Azerbaijani (Turki dialect). Instruction in the five lower classes of the primary schools will be in the Azerbaijani tongue). 13. The Government agrees that the Kurds residing in Azerbaijan shall enjoy the prerogatives contained in this agreement and, in conformity with7 &lt;&lt;*) article 3 of the Government communique, shall teach in their own language up to the fifth year in the primary schools. Footnote 1 .—Minorities resident in Azerbaijan, such as the Armenians and the Assyrians, shall also enjoy the right to teach in their own tongue up to the fifth year in the primary schools. 14. Since the Government proposes to place before the Fifteenth Legislature a new municipal electoral law for the whole of the country, which is to be based fpi democratic principles, that is to say, on those of a suffrage which is universal, secret, direct, and equal for all, therefore, immediately after the passing of this law, elections for the municipal councils will commence in Azerbaijan as in all other parts of the country. vTHIS[79 —102] b THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

[I&gt;**36/315/34] Co P y No ' Military Attaches Intelligence Summary No. '2b Secret, for the P er f°d June to ls£ July, 1946.— {Communicated in Tehran despatch i\o. 2J4 of 2nd July; Received \Mh July.) 1.11 Persian A ffairs. Political. TWO more communiques by the Persian Prime Minister have been published. The first, which oame out on the 23rd June, was a warning to the landloids of villages of Tehran district to deal fairly with their tenants and to the tenants to disregard the attempts made by some political parties to dissuade them from paying their legal rents. The communique added that a special committee has been set up to hear disputes between landlord and tenant and that its findings would be strongly upheld by the Government. The second com munique, published on the 24th June, after declaring that certain workers organisations had abused the goodwill and indulgence of the Prime Minister and exceeded their proper functions to the detriment of the public welfare, stated in emphatic terms that such activities would no longer be permitted. The Prime Minister warned those concerned that he would not permit such workers organisations to defy the law nor to play fast and loose with the destinies of the people. . . , , ,. 2. The second of the above communiques was too unpalatable a medicine for Tudeh stomachs and on the 25th June a crowd of unemployed, numbering some 300, attempted to break into the Tehran Municipal offices. The police had to open fire. One rioter was seriously wounded. Some window panes were smashed. The crowd then dispersed. Some newspapers of the Left have criticised the Prime Minister for his communique, saying that they have supported him so far as a reformer and friend of the people but that he will forfeit their support if he shows “ reactionary tendencies ”—the standard form of abuse for any Persian official who prefers the rule of Government to mob rule and who tries to maintain law and order. 3 . In a lengthy broadcast on the 29th June the Persian Prime Minister announced the formation of a new political party called the ‘ 1 Democrat Party of Iran.” Its programme is given as an appendix to this summary. It is too early to assess popular reaction, but the announcement has created a stir and many have already joined the party. Some see in this a counter-niove to the Tudeh designed to entice away their adherents. Others, again, think that it is just an electioneering gambit by which Qawam-us-Sultaneh hopes to secure the election of his nominees, knowing that out of fear or flattery nearly all Persians will join a party brought into being by the Prime Minister himself and thus be obliged to vote for candidates who will, themselves, be members of the same party. One prominent feature of the Prime Minister's broadcast was a warning to the diplomatic representatives of foreign Powers to abstain from interference in the internal affairs of Persia. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 4 . His Majesty's Acting Consul-General reports that the Azerbaijan National Bank was formally opened on the 19th June. It will not take over the assets or the premises of the Banque Midi, but is said to have a capital of its own amounting to 50 million rials. The source of this sum is not stated. The former assistant manager of the Banque Midi has been appointed the first mana'ger of the new concern. 5 . The same source reports that ad but one of the railway commission sent from Tehran (see paragraph 15 of the Intelligence Sumipary No. 23) have returned to Tehran. According to this one member, the taking over of the2 railway has been delayed because the commission discovered that the rolling- w j stock was badly damaged, the permanent way in disrepair and much equip- attemi ment missing. A Russian commission is said to be coming from Moscow. It ^ is not thought likely that the Iranian State Railway will have the temerity to demau make claims against the Soviet Government on the lines of those made against Counc His Majesty's Government (see paragraph 20 of last Intelligence Summary). states 6 . In amplification of its recent communique, which stated that the only, province of Azerbaijan would comprise “ Ustans ” (Governorates Gep^ral) sayi^ III and IV, the Government has explained that this is, in fact, a return s_]ihe g 0 old arrangement prevailing during the Qajar regime when Azerbaijan more i stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Turkish frontier and as far south as Saada Sardasht in Kurdistan. It was Reza Shah, the communique explains, who, ment for reasons of administrative convenience, split the province into two with authoi capitals at Tabriz and Rezaieh. declin 7 . abdic* Kurdistan. race ^ 7. General Razmara, in an interview given to the press and in conversa- of dar tion with the British Military Attache, gave the following views and information Consu concerning Kurdistan :— and a (i) That the present situation in Kurdistan was largely due to the lack Russn of interest in the Kurds on the part of the Central Government, to kind ( a lack of continuity in policy or, rather, to the lack of a policy at 1 all, to official apathy as to the need for recognising the Kurds or, compl indeed for that matter, any of the Persian tribes as Persian subjects 1 entitled to the provision of health and educational services, the visite&lt; supply of Government-rationed commodities and facilities for trade. detail (ii) That on his arrival in Kurdistan he had found the garrisons of Saqqiz, from Sardasht, Baneh, Mizdeh and Robat besieged by the Kurds and the suffici communications leading to these places cut. childr (iii) That a visit to these places in the company of the Democrat and chief, Kurdish representatives had established the fact that those frequent * 1^ skirmishes were in all cases begun by the Kurds and not by the defyn Persian army. * (iv) That the Democrat and Kurdish representatives admitted this fact, ( 30th recognised the sovereign rights of the Persian Government and agreed recom to put an end to these skirmishes. out ^ (v) That the agreement signed by Muzaffar Firuz and Pishevari on the that 1 11 th June in Tabriz had laid down a neutral belt of 4 kilom. in °f 11 depth between the opposing forces, but that the Kurds, on the ^ [&gt;^ 0] 15th June, had broken this truce, crossed the neutral zone and had AhwE attacked the Persian forces. (vi) That he had met Ghazi Muhammad of Mahabad at the latter's request Divis on neutral ground and had subsequently met Hama Rashid, Omar cautn Khan Shakkak, Mulla Mustafa Barzani and Sheikh Baba. 1 (vii) That the Kurds had thereafter shown a more conciliatory spirit and * had agreed to give up raiding the Persian army’s communications. (viii) That, in regard to the “ Kurdish Movement,” there did not appear to . ... exist in Mahabad any organisation comparable to that of the Khon Azerbaijan Democrats. 1 (ix) That the Kurds were grouped round their different leaders and had Khor; different aims. Among the followers of Mulla Mustafa (who number name less than 800) were to be found Iraqi Kurds and a considerable Tudel number (given to the British Military Attache as twenty) of deserter order Iraqi officers. Tilde (x) That the total of the Kurdish forces is in the region of 5,000, inferior Minh in both numbers and equipment to the Persian army opposing them. high- (xi) That he hoped that after the arrival of Ghazi Muhammad in Tehran Guna (he arrived on the 26th June) the question would be settled amicably. as un (xii) (To the British Military Attache and not to the press.) That he hoped his e that some conciliatory gesture towards Mulla Mustafa Barzani could gend; be made by the Iraqi Government as he was sure that Mulla Mustafa and his followers would be very willing to return to Iraq if assured of a pardbn. Bush Khuzistan. . . ^ 8 . A riot occurred in Ahwaz on the 21st June and much damage was done in ^ to house property. The hostility of the crowd was directed against the amon iconoclastic and atheistical sect of the Kasravi, a body of no size or importance4 ^ • Appointments. 15.—(i) Nawab, a former Persian Consul-General in New York, to be head of the Treaty Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

Persian A rmy. 16. Two hundred and forty-four sergeant-majors have been promoted to 3rd lieutenant. The vacant post of C.G.S. has not yet been filled. Persian Gendarmerie. 17. Colonel Schwarzkopf informed the British military attache that two commissions—one for Azerbaijan and one for Khamseh (Zinjan)—are leaving shortly to discuss the means whereby the Democrat “Fidais” are to be incor porated in the gendarmerie. They will have no powers, but are to report to the Persian Prime Minister on return. Colonel Schwarzkopf stated that he would like the Democrats to agree to accept regular gendarmerie officers down to company commanders, but that, if this was not possible, he would agree to their accepting battalion commanders. He thought that there was a much better chance of securing agreement with the Azerbaijan Government over the future control of the gendarmerie than over the question of the future of the army. The Court. 18. His Imperial Majesty the Shah held the usual levee on the occasion of the religious festival of Habas. 19. Princess Ashraf left for Moscow on the 28th June (see paragraph 16 of last Intelligence Summary). The Princess’s suite comprised Mme. Ibtehaj (wife of Abul Hasan Ibtehaj, Governor of the Banque Midi who speaks Russian fluently), Mme. Hidayet (wife of the Under-Secretary of State for War), Mme. Fardust (wife of an aide-de-camp of the Shah), Dr. Marzaban (a prominent figure in the Red Lion and Sun Society), General Shafai (military attache in Moscow), Mohsin Qaragozulu (a Court official), two minor Court functionaries, and Iqbal (the Russophile editor of Iran-i-Ma). 20 . His Imperial Majesty the Shah is reported in the press to have donated a sum of 10 million rials towards the cost of the installation of a drinking-water supply for the town of Tabriz. His Imperial Majesty had previously accorded an audience to Dr. Javid, the newly appointed Governor-General of Azerbaijan. The Press. 21 . The tone of the Persian press remains violently and virulently anti- British. The usual attacks against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company as capitalist exploiters continue. The sinister designs of British Imperialists in the south receive the customary prominence. The Tudeh organ Rahbar has come out with the Pravda article of the 15th June (reported in paragraph 2 of Intelligence Summary No. 23). A new target for attack is the Imperial Bank of Iran, which is accused inter alia of being a centre of espionage, a tool of British imperialism, of usury and of maltreatment of its Persian employees.

SECRET MILITARY ATTACHE ’ S' INTELLIGENCE SUMARY NO.26 FOR THE PERIOD 1st JULY to 8th JULY, 1946. PERSIAN AFFAIRS Political 1* Tho past -week has produced much political gossip and speculation but, politics in Persia consisting, as they largely do, of hasty and unconnected actions by a few highly volatile personalities, he would be a rash man who would venture to produce the outcome of recent events. For some ten days past some observers have pretended to see a cooling off in the relations between the Persian Prime Minister and the Soviet Embassy. They sec in the recent visit of Princess Ashraf to Moscow an attempt by the Russians to win over the Shah and widen the breach between him and Qawam-us-Saltaneh. The formation of his Democrat Party of Iran (see para.3 of last Intelligence Summary) according to these observers, is further proof of Qawam r s breaking with the Russians and of his decision to stand up to the Tudeh party. They further adduce as evidence In support of their theory tho recent arrest of Ahmad Ali Sipihr, MuwarrIkh-ud-Dowleh, the Minister of Commerce and Industry who, perhaps more than any other member of the Cabinet, was regarded as a Russian tool. /The reasons for his arrest are variously given as peculation, inattention to his duties and intrigue against the Prime Minister but, whatever the truth may be, there is hardly a single Persian who will regret the disappearance from the political arena of this grossly dishonest, double-dealing roguejJ? Meanwhile the next move by the new Democrat Party of Iran is anxiously awaited. Criticism of the venture by the papers of the extreme left has been comparatively mild consisting, in brief, of surprise that a Prime Minister should form a party and of fears that n reactionary' elements and dishonest capitalists will be allowed to join the party and escape thereby the punishment for their misdeeds. Indeed, there are some who say that the very mildness of the criticism by the Russian controlled Press indicates that the new party's primary aim is not opposition to the Tudeh. Most of those who have already joined are jun^or government officials whose sole aim, probably, is to retain landlords, tribal chiefs and influential po i Icians are tending to hang back until Qawam gives some clearer indication of his policy vis a vis the Tudeh. INTERNAL SECURITY. Khuzis tan.X 3. Mlsbah Patemi, tho Governor General of Khuzistan Is still In Tehran as ho has not yet received confirmation in writing of his new powers regarding martial law (see para.12 of last Intelligence Summary). Pars . 4. Strikes at two spinning mills In Shiraz are reported. 5. The O.C. Gendarmerie Regiment at Shiraz confirmed in conversation with H.M. Consul Shiraz that Khosru Qashqai had been appointed as ’’supervisor” (the Persian term used was not one in normal use in governmental phraseology) of Pars and Jahrum. Khosro is reported by the same source as having been appointed as Security officer for Shahreza which, lying about 50 miles south of Isfahan (its old name was Qumisheh) would appear to be well without the limits of Qashqai territory. (A different version of this information was given in para.10 of Intelligence Summary No.21.) Bushire. 6. After the departure of the Tudeh agitators, who were not locals but had been sent to Bushire to stir up trouble, the wages dispute among the dockers (see para.14 of last Intelligence Summary) was settled on reasonable terms. Bandar Abbas . 7. An attempt to set up a Tudeh branch in Bandar Abbas has been made. On 20th June about one hundred labourers of the Khunji spinning mill wont on strike for higher wages. Zahidan. 8, A curious incident occurred in Zahidan on or about 21st June when the body of a seven year old Persian boy, who had been missing for six days, was recoverred from a cess-pit. Post mortem examination indicated that he had been strangled. Suspicion fell upon some members of the Bahai Sect and three of them subsequently confessed to the crime. Moslem feeling against them ran very high but the military controlled the situation and, by confining the Bahais to their houses, managed to avert bloodshed. Birjand. 9. As the result, it is presumed, of the incident reported above, anti-Bahai riots broke out in Birjand on 29th June to quell which the military, police and gendarmerie were forced to fire on the crowd resulting in the death of one person and the wounding of five. Most of the Bahai houses have been looted. The city is now quiet and the military are patrolling the streets. Gilan. 10. Some days ago a Tudeh agitator of the name of Sharifi was arrested on the orders of the Governor General. Later, telegraphic orders for his release were received from Tehran. On about 1st July the Jute mill at Resht was set fire to and partially destroyed. jthorasan /Khorasan 11. According to a consular source Ghulam Reza, said to be a son of the late Reza Shah by a temporary ('sigheh”) marriage, has been /** arrested in Meshed. During Reza Shah*s lifetime his identity was kept secret and he was given an allowance. jifter Reza Shah’s abdication he presented himself to the present Shah but was exiled to Kerman. The recent arrest, therefore, is presumably on account of his having left his residence forcee at Kerman. 12. Abbas Khan Tabatabai, Governor of Kuchan, has been arrested for exceeding his powers and also for peculation. Kerman 13. The first overt act of violence by the Tudeh party against the new Democrat Party of Iran Is reported from Kerman. On the evening of 2nd July, during the inauguration of the new party, the leading Tudeh representative, one Zabeti, staged a counter demonstration which ended in a riot. Some damage to the Democrat party’s headquarters was done. The police fired a few rounds Into the air whereupon the supporters of both parties took to their heels PERSIAN ARMY, 14. General Razmara, as was expected, has been reappointed C.G.S. His close association with Muzaffar Firuz and, through him, with the Russians has caused a great deal of apprehension in military circles. The Minister of War opposed the appointment but was overruled in the Cabinet. The amount of pressure brought to bear by the Persian Prime Minister to secure the appointment may be gauged by the fact that H.I.M. the Shah, in conversation with the B.M.A. about two months ago, remarked that Gen. Razmara was disloyal dishonest and little bettor than a Russian agent. The Shah went on to say that he would never consent to his re-employmont and regarded him ,? as a viper which must be crushed”. Indecisive as the Shah is, there is no reason to think that he has changed his opinions. It Is his inability to make himself felt that grows plainer every day. One of General Razmara’s first acts as C.G.S. was to publish a communique stating that a commission had been set up In the General Staff to investigate complaints and grievances of officers. Officers who complain of injustice will not be victimized for so doing. Officers who fled or absented themselves on account of harsh treatment will be pardoned. This is, no doubt, intended chiefly for those officers who, in his spy-hunting mania. General Arfa banished or imprisoned as Tudeh sympathisers or suspects in the Persian ^rmy mutiny of last September. A change of C.G.S. usually results in numerous changes in the higher appointments of the Persian Army and this is all the more likely in the present instance since Generals Razmara and Arfa are sworn enemies and one of Razmara’s first tasks will be to r^ot out those appointed by his rival and replace them by his cronies. The replacement of Colonel Afshar Oglu by Colonel Hejazi in the appointment of G.O.C. 10th (Khuzistan) Division is the first of these changes and a second Is reported in the Press but not yet confirmed, namely the replacement of Colonel Vossuq as G.O.C., Khorasan Division by Sartip Nasrullah Bayendor, the Engineer in Chief.APPOINTMENTS. 15.

A commission under the leadership of Sadiqi, Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Roads and Communications, has left for Tabriz to make recommendations for the implementation of the Persian Government's recent undertaking to the Azerbaijan Government to complete as soon as possible the Mianeh - Tabriz section of the railway. The Press/THE PRESS 20. The Soviet press, on 2nd July, under the heading 'Persian newspaper on situation in Khuzistan' printed a Tehran Tass agency report culled from the newspaper 'Zafar' of 28th June. The article accused the Arab chiefs of having received 50,000 rials ^^each from British Secret Service funds for the struggle against 'Democratic Organisations'. Repressive action by the Persian military at the request of the A.I.0.0. is also alleged. The British are further accused of turning Abadan into an imperiflm in imperio by maintaining their own police force, of levying their own taxes and of extracting a toll of rials 200 for every motor vehicle travelling between Abadan and Khorramshahr. In conclusion the article demands that the Persian Government should annul the present concession and negotiate a new one by the terms of which the A.I.O.C. should be subjected to stricter control.

In the press were published announcements of the receipt by the Prime Minister oi telegrams from tne heads of the Qashgai, the Bakhtiari and the “Union of the Tribes of Khuzistan which announced their pleasure at the formation of the party and their aaherence to it : and further reference is made to the receipt ot thousands oi telegiams from individuals, groups and tribes. . j- * 2 Ghazi Muhammed, the Kurdish leader, has left iehran for Kurdistan (see paragraph 7 (xi) of Intelligence Summary No. 25). The press speaks ot the “informal nature’’ of his visit in that he had come only for prehminai^ discussions,” and states that official circles say that his departure does not indicate a breakdown of the talks in that he has only ^one to discuss first developments with the Kurdish leaders. A further point of interest is that the same aiticle states that, according to “ usually well-informed sources, Ghazi Muhammed has demanded the termination oU martial law and the withdrawal of Persian forces from Kurdistan. 3. The Persian Prime Minister, who has been ill for about a fortnight, has recovered sufficiently to enable him to resume his duties at his office. Internal Security. Khuzistan. 4. The situation in the concessional area of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company deteriorated during the week culminating in the outbreak of the threatened general strike on the termination of the extended ultimatum period. The negotia tions between the company and the Tudeh representatives had been reduced by the 8th July to a main issue of Friday (weekly holiday) pay which the leaders insisted had to be settled immediately. The indications were that the Tudeh leaders feared that thev might lose control of the workers if they could not produce early results. The matter was referred to Tehran for discussion with the Persian Government who were to decide a minimum workers’ wage. In consequence it was hoped that yielding on the part of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company would be interpreted as taking place on the recommendation of the Government and not in face of Tudeh demands. However it was feared in Abadan that procrastination by the Government in making a decision would result in the Tudeh striking without further reference to their official represen tatives. On the 10th July both the Governor-General, Misbah Fatemi, and the new Divisional Commander, Colonel Hejazi, arrived at Ahwaz. The former was in possession of the requisite decree of the Council of Ministers authorising him to declare, at his discretion, martial law in any part of Khuzistan. He also appeared much encouraged by his conversations with the Prime Minister. Hejazi also appeared confident and stated that he had orders to take the strongest measures to restore Government authority. Meanwhile two Tudeh members had been arrested on a charge of assaulting a Persian officer in uniform while on duty (see paragraph 11 of Intelligence Summary No. 25). The case against them was quite clear and they had already been ejected by their own headquarters from Agha Jari. From there they went to Masjid-i-Sulaiman where they engineered an abortive two-day strike. They were finally arrested at Gach Saran on°the 9th July. A strike broke out at Agha Jari on the morning of the 10th [80—4] 12 * as a protest against the arrests. The spokesman of the strikers was, surprisingly enough, the minor Bakhtiari chieftain, Hafizullah (referred to in paragraph 11 of Intelligence Summary No. 25). The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company concurred with the Persian authorities in agreeing that the release^ of the two leaders would be most undesirable as being too encouraging to the Tudeh. However the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were able to report on the 11th that the local iudeh leader had persuaded tne workers to return to work. During this strike, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company reports, the Tudeh leader was in complete control. Wr* All transport was seized, the telephone exchange taken over, and British personnel confined to their bungalows by Tudeh pickets. On the 14th July a general strike broke out at Abadan, Khorramshahr and all the fields areas. 1 he Tudeh were immediately in complete control and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company areas were isolated as regards telephonic communication. The Governor-General declared a state of martial law in Abadan. At 8 a.m. the same day in Abadan the military established pickets and started to clear Tudeh pickets who were obstructing food lorries. They were unable to assume complete control at once owing to lack of senior officers. The A.I.O.C. were to fly in some, also reinforce ments of 100 men for the garrison of 250 were to arrive. Later orders had been given to open fire if necessary and some sniping was reported to have taken place. On the 15th July it was reported that there had been several cases of arson and looting but that the Tudeh were retiring to their clubs after a request by the military to control the situation. Accordingly the situation was considered to be easing. During this period essential services had been maintained but production had virtually ceased. In Masjid-i-Sulaiman also the Tudeh appeared to have established complete control. They were reported to be searching offices and one British employee was arrested by them : however, he was only taken to Tudeh Headquarters, warned to be pacific, and released. In Khorramshahr a Tudeh meeting was called for the night of the 15th July but there appear to have been no incidents. In Ahwaz all workers, including domestic servants, were prevented from going to work by Tudeh “security police.” It is of interest that the Soviet Consul had been seen visiting the A.I.O.C. compound three times on the evening of the 13th, his last trip being at midnight. From the outlying fields there has been no news. The Governors of both Abadan and Khorramshahr visited the consul and appeared surprisingly at ease in face of a difficult situation. They have given out that the Tudeh are marching on the Arabs and there has been a mention of arming certain sheikhs if necessary. Conversations with Aramish in Tehran elicited the information that the Prime Minister had sent Misbah Fatemi clear instructions to maintain order, to declare martial law in any part of Khuzistan where he deemed it necessary, to arrest Tudeh police wherever found and to ascertain the names of the ringleaders with a view to their arrest or deportation. Ammish also stated that reinforcements of one battalion and twenty-four trucks were being despatched from Tehran. A zerbaijan. 5. Dr. Javid, the new Governor-General, arrived at Tabriz on the 4th July. He was accompanied by military representatives of the Central Government who were to discuss the future of the Azerbaijan People’s Army and the Fidais (this presumably under article 4 of the Tehran-Tabriz Agreement published as an Appendix to Intelligence Summary No. 24), and by railway engineers who were to inspect the Tabriz-Julfa railway and to consider plans for the projected Tabriz-Mianeh line. The press also reports the departure of Sartip Alavi (A.D.C. to the Minister of War who recently visited Tabriz with Muzaffar Firuz —paragraph 1 of Intelligence Summary No. 23) for that town. 6. A congress of leaders of the Azerbaijan Youth Movement was held on the 6th July. It is noteworthy that most of the members of this movement are now in uniform. 7. A mail service has been restored on three days in the week but a censorship which is especially strict on Tehran newspapers is being maintained. Export of currency is still prohibited and in view of the large number of people who have left Tabriz since the exit-permit system was withdrawn the local Government are considering reimposing it. 8. The local Government are reported not to be pressing for the inclusion of Zenjan in Azerbaijan. Fars. 9. Reference paragraph 4 of last Intelligence Summary. All emplovees returned to work unconditionally on the 11th July.Semnan. 10. According to press communiques published on the 10th July the Government declared martial law in the areas of Semnan, Garmsar and Veramin with Sarhang Qazim Muzahiri as Military Governor. This step was taken to quell disorders resulting from dissensions between landlords and peasants. The Government despatched a commission under M. Pirnia, Under-Secretary of State to the Prime Minister, to enquire into the circumstances. The commission has returned after cancelling certain taxes payable by the peasants to their landlords and initiating medical relief. The order promulgating martial law has not yet been withdrawn. Khorasan. 11. The activities of the Hizb-i-Tudeh in Khorasan have taken an increasingly anti-British tone and have included attacks against Iranian members of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the posting on walls of anti-British slogans. On the evening of the 4th July a Tudeh meeting of about 1,000 persons assembled, and were addressed from the verandah of the Tudeh Club, which is opposite the consulate-general. Speeches delivered were abusive in tone against the British, putting forward the usual charges of interference in internal affairs and attempts to maintain a stranglehold on the country. 12. The Hizb-i-Democrat-i-Iran is not making much progress in Khorasan, Chiefly because an unfortunate choice of local representatives has aroused doubts of the disinterested quality of Qawam’s intentions. His motives are thought to be more to establish his own dictatorship rather than to cast off the Russian yoke. 13. In accordance with the Prime Minister’s order (see paragraph 3 of Intelligence Summary No. 24), all Bakhshdars have been recalled from their posts to Meshed. Rail Communications. 14. The Persian railway authorities have asked His Majesty’s Embassy to arrange for discussions to take place with the Government of India respecting the operation of that section of the Quetta—Zahidan Railway which lies inside Persian territory, i.e., Mirjawa-Zahidan. The Persian railway authorities have mentioned the question of a payment to be made by the Government of India in return for permission to exploit the Persian section. Postal Communications. 15.— (a) It is announced in the press that normal telegraphic communica tions with Persia and Afghanistan have been restored. They are carried by a line running through Toyyabat and Islam Qila, and the charge is 6 rials per word. (5) Postal communications have been restored between Tehran and Tabriz with a service running three days per week. Civil Appointments. 16. —(i) Mohammed Taqi Nabavi (Moazid-ud-Dowleh) (F.O. 150; M.A. 188) to be Persian Minister to Czechoslovakia. He is father-in-law to Abul Hasan Ibtehaj, Governor of the Banque-i-Milli. About a year ago he succeeded in getting himself appointed as Persian Minister at Lisbon, but a change of Prime Ministers caused the appointment to lapse and he did not proceed. (ii) Dr. Amir Aslani to be third secretary in the Persian Legation at Prague. (iii) Zain-ul-Abedin Rahnema (F.O. 186; M.A. 237), Persian Minister at Paris, is proceeding to rejoin his post.

The first detachment of the Persian contingent which attended the London Victory Parade returned via Cairo on the 9th July, and a second is following on the 15th July. _ . 19. Lieutenant-Colonel Zanganeh, who was commanding the Kezaiyeh Brigade at the time it surrendered to the Democrat forces, has been released - from arrest in Tehran, as also has been Colonel Ali Akbar Nurbakhsh, th commandant of gendarmerie at Rezaiyeh at that time (see paragraph 6 or Intelligence Summary No. 21). 20. It is reported in the press that a battalion of the 5th (Naderi) Infantry Regiment arrived at Bandar Pahlevi on the 29th June from Resht. Gendarmerie (Nigahbani). 21. A commission assembled during the week, it is reported, in the press, to consider the establishment of an Officers’ Training College for the Nigahbani. This step has been urged by Colonel Schwarzkopf ever since his arrival. By this means only, he claims, can he select and train his own officers and end the present system whereby he must accept the leavings of the Persian army. Soviet Interests. 22. — {a) Information has been received from Zabul that the Soviet Consulate there is to be closed. The reason for this step is not known. (b) It is announced in the press that M. Gasparov of the Soviet Ministry for Foreign Affairs has been nominated counsellor to the Soviet Embassy in Tehran; and that M. Jakobov, additional counsellor, has returned from Moscow where he has been on leave. A fghan Interests. 23. Abdur Rauf, the new Afghan Consul-General at Meshed, arrived there on the 9th July.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. July 31, 1946. SECRET. Section 2. [E 7289/315/34] Copy No. i Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 28, Secret, for the Period to 21st July, 1946.— {Communicated in Tehran Despatch bo. 2X1 J 2\th July; Received 31s£ July.) Persian Affairs. Political. Qawtam-us-Saltaneh’s newly formed Democrat Party of f ian ^ oes ,&gt; n , ot appear to be making much headway and has so far attracted veiy tew o e moderate or Right-wing elements. Their suspicions that the new party is meie ) an electioneering stunt and in no way a challenge to the Tudeh are based on the following facts :■— (i) The names of the Central Committee of Management do not inspire confidence, six out of ten of them being strong Tudeh supporters. (-^ lie personality notes on the members are given as an appendix to this Minimaly.) (ii) No prominent politician or statesman has joined it. There are in Persia, contrary to common belief, some older statesmen enjoying a well-earned reputation for honesty and patriotism such as, for example, Mutamin-ul-Mulk, and it is significant that no one of that calibre has joined the party, much less been elected to its managing committee. (iii) That Muzaffar Firuz is a member is sufficient cause for the honest to hold aloof. . (iv) The party, so far, has shown no signs of wishing to oppose the Tuddh, and the very mild tone of such criticism of the party as has appeared so far in the Tudeh press is significant. (v) Had Qawam-us-Saltaneh planned to resist the Tudeh, he must have tried to win over to his party Right-wing elements, and this he has either not attempted or failed signally to achieve and must continue to fail as long as he keeps under arrest their leaders and their newspapers under suspension. (vi) In order to obtain their oil concession in North Persia, the Russians at first showed great keenness in speeding up a settlement of the Azerbaijan issue so that elections could begin and a new Majlis come into being, Qawam-us- Saltaneh having undertaken to table a Bill for this concession before the new Majlis within seven months from the 24th March. Time is slipping by and as yet the Persian Government has made no official announcement concerning the Royal proclamation, which is the first step in the elections. From start to finish they will take at least four months, which would mean that, even if they were to commence at once, a new Majlis could not have been convened before the 24th November, i.e., one month later than the outside limit set by the Russians in their agreement with Qawam-us-Saltaneh after his return from Moscow. No protest against this delay has as yet appeared in the Russian-controlled Persian press and it appears, therefore, that they are content to wait in the knowledge that time, Qawam-us-Saltaneh and his new party are all on their side and that when the elections are completed the new Majlis will contain a majority of their way of thinking. 2. The Persian Government have addressed notes to the diplomatic repre sentatives of the Big Five Powers in Tehran requesting that Persia should be given a seat at the forthcoming Peace Conference. The note stated that Persia’s diplomatic representatives accredited to the countries of the Big Five hadi been instructed to make parallel representations. 3. Seyyid Abul Qasim Kashani has been arrested while on his way to Meshed. No reasons have been published, but it is said that the Seyvid had made violent criticisms of Muzaffar Firuz, of Qawam-us-Saltaneh’s Government and of his new party. It will be recalled that, after many unsuccessful attempts to have him arrested by the Persian police, the British military authorities finally succeeded in rounding up Seyyid Abul Qasim Kashani in 1944 as a prominent Fifth Columnist. The halo of martyrdom which he assumed on his [80-93] ' Brelease did not become him and his political twists and turns and his unpopu larity with his brother mullahs undermined what influence he may have had. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 4. The Persian army officers who accompanied the new Governor-General to Tabriz (see paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary) have made no progress in their discussions about the future of either the Azerbaijan People’s army or “ Fidais.” They are becoming impatient and wish to return to Tehran, i his information, originally received from consular sources, has been confirmed by the Minister for War to the British Military Attache. Kurdistan. 5. Ghazi Muhammad, who returned from Tehran last week (see paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary), is still in Tabriz. The chiefs of the Shakkak and Herki Kurds are also there. A member of the American Embassy recently paid a flying visit to Rezaiyeh and Mahabad and the American Vice-Consul at Tabriz, who accompanied him. said he was impressed by the energy and the “ genuine Kurdish nature ” of the nationalist movement, as also by the Kurds’ antipathy to the Azerbaijan Democrats. In his one day’s stay at Mahabad he failed to find any signs of Russian direction of the movement. 6. The American Military Attache, who returned to Tehran on the 15th July from a tour of Kurdistan, gave the British Military Attach^ the following account of what he saw and heard:— General. The 4th Division is holding a general front running east to west along the line Miranshah-Saqqiz-Baneh-Saidasht from, inclusive, Miranshah to. inclusive, Sardasht. Advance divisional headquarters are established at Saqqiz. Main headquarters, with training and reinforcement troops, are at Senneh. The line of communication road Senneh-Miranshah is regarded as being free from any Kurdish threat and is protected only by normal gendarmerie garrisons. From Miranshah to Saqqiz the road is protected by infantry established in block houses. The road is open during the day. West of Saqqiz the road is held by the Kurds, who have established a half-circle round Saqqiz running from north, through west, to south of the town. All garrisons west of this half-circle are isolated. These garrisons are in a state of siege. The Kurds permit military lorries to run through carrying supplies only and search them for reinforcements of ammunition or men. Communications are maintained during the day between Saqqiz and Baneh by heliograph via an intermediate station on the Miraveh( ?) Pass. Dispositions of Troops. Senneh (main base) One regiment infantry; one regiment cavalry; one battery field artillery; one company field engineers. Miranshah : One regiment cavalry. Road block-houses :Four companies of infantry. Saqqiz : Divisional operational headquarters: One regiment infantry; two regiments cavalry; two Bofors mountain guns; detachment of mortars- four tanks (?). Air force: Five Hawker Hinds for ground strafing; five Tio- e - Moths. Miraveh(?) Pass: One company infantry; one company M.M.Gs. Baneh : One regiment. Sardasht: One regiment infantry in town; one regiment infantry east of river at Rubat. T actical. (g) In an attack in mid-June the Kurds drove the Persians off one of their outposts to the south-west of Saqqiz. This was subsequently retaken by the Persian forces in a two-company attack (under the regimental command) which was preceded by first air strafing and a subsequent artillery preparation Persian casualties were seven teen (?) killed and a considerable number of wounded. (6) General Humayuni considers his artillery virtually useless since they have not a sufficiently high trajectory to be effective in this steep mountain countrv and prefers the use of mortars. ^(c) The Persians are on the defensive, since they have orders not to attack the Kurds, but are in a continual state of alert against expected attacks. (d) The main aggressors appear to be Barzanis from Iraq. Ke r man. 7. On instructions from Tehran the Governor-General arrested all the Tudeh leaders in Kerman on the 16th July. Five of the most prominent, including t)r. Vakili, were sent to Tehran under a police guard on the 17th July. Following this action a better attitude is being shown in the mills towards the management by the employees. Merchants and shopkeepers have telegraphed their thanks to the Prime Minister. Fars. 8. According to Consular sources Khosro Qashgai’s latest intrigues are directed towards the removal of Brigadier Himmat, the G.O.C. Fars Division and towards the appointment as Governor-General of Fars of Roza Hikmat, Sardar Fakhir. This lazy and corpulent official has always shown himself amenable to the Qashgai and, though it is by now ancient history, was consistently unfriendly to the British in South Persia during World War I. Khuzistan. 9. After the happenings related in paragraph 4 of last Intelligence Summary events in Abadan moved rapidly to a climax. After the proclamation of martial law and the arrest of five prominent Tudeh leaders by the Governor- General the military began to clear the Tudeh pickets and it appeared that the situation was getting under control. On the evening of the 15th July, however, a mass attack was carried out by a large mob of Tudeh hooligans upon the head quarters of the Arab League which resulted in casualties on both sides amounting to forty-seven killed and 176 wounded. Two prominent Arab merchants were done to death in a peculiarly brutal fashion, their corpses subsequently being mutilated. Largely owing to the energetic action taken by the Military Governor of Abadan—a Major Fathi—the military were able to prevent a general massacre. On the following day a commission from Tehran arrived. It comprised MuzafTar Firuz, the Prime Minister’s Secretary, Aramish. the acting Minister for Com merce and Industry and three Tudeh leaders. They proceeded to negotiate w T ith the Anglo-Persian Oil Company management on the basis of the workers' previous demands for a minimum “ basket ” of rials 45 per diem and Friday pay retrospective from the 18th May. While these negotiations were in progress Muzaffar Firuz, announcing that he had full powers from the Prime Minister to settle the strike, forced the Governor-General to release the five arrested leaders. The negotiations concluded by the management agreeing to pay and the workers agreeing to accept a minimum “ basket ' of rials 35 per diem plus Friday pay. Muzaffar Firuz’s action was probably due to his desire to humiliate the Governor-General and to raise Tudeh morale by claiming that the termination of the strike was only rendered possible by the release of the arrested leaders. Had the strike collapsed owing to the commendably firm action by the Governor- General and the military or to the reaching of an agreement between the management and the workers. Tudeh prestige and Muzaffar Firuz’s own position vis-d-vis the Tudeh must have suffered. The situation is now reported to be calm for the moment with the men back at work and production in Abadan at from 50 to 60 per cent, of normal. Martial law is still in force and there are about seventy persons under arrest at Abadan and smaller numbers at Ahwaz and Khorramshahr. Arab feelings over the recent events are highly inflamed and local observers say that any relaxation of the tight control exercised by the militarv would result in retaliatory measures against the Tudeh by the Arabs the extent of which could not be predicted. 10. On the 17th July His Majesty’s Embassy notified the Persian Govern ment of the impending arrival in the Shatt-el-Arab off Abadan of the sloop Wild Goose and the cruiser Norfolk and asked for the usual courtesies and facilities in the event of their anchoring in Persian waters. The Persian Govern ment replied by drawing the attention of the embassy to the law passed in 1934 which required a minimum of eight days' notice of such- visits. They also pointed out that if the visit of those two ships was connected with the recent strike the Persian Government must consider it as an unfriendly act and must protest. They concluded by asking for the removal of the ships as soon as possible. In fact, neither ship entered Persian waters, the Wild Goose having anchored in Iraqi waters and later having proceeded to Basra to effect repairs to her [80—93] b 24 wireless. The Norfolk also anchored for one night in Iraqi waters foui mi es down stream of Abadan and left the next day for Bahrein. Hie Tersian pi ess has made much of the affair, even the respectable Journal de having (ome out with a tale of the arrival of three cruisers entering Persian waters. The Press. 11. The anti-British tone of the Left-wing Persian press grows more violent^^^ and this crescendo of slander will continue as long as Qawam-us-Saltanen and nis Cabinet lack the will, the power and the courage to restrain the editors ot those newspapers. In the meanwhile, much disappointment is felt by persons hitherto well-disposed towards the British who interpret our silence either to tear of Russia or to lack of interest in Persia in which, as in most oriental countries, truth cannot be relied upon to prevail and many a good case goes by default. An extract, chosen at random from this week's Leftist press is given below : Rahbar, 19th July, 1946. Victory Parade.—Continuation of article criticises Taqi Zadeh for not having welcomed the Persian delegation and states that if the Persian ruling class were not different and unpatriotic, other countries would not have regarded Persians as their slaves. An officer had called Taqi Zadeh the representative of the Oil Company. Persians in London complained of Taqi Zadeh and considered him a Britisher. He had revived the court of the despotic Persian rulers. Persians in London were kept ignorant of Persian affairs. r I hey received Ettela’at only. Freedom-loving papers should be sent to Persians in foreign countries, especially Britain. In the parade the British army, which had delayed the Second Front in order to weaken the Red army and help Hitler, was foremost, whereas there was no sign of the Red army which had brought Hitler to his knees. Hitler was brought into office by the help of the British and instigated to start war by the capitalists. Britain had thrown her Allies to the front. Small countries like Persia had suffered deprivations and Seyyid Zia had been sent to them to restore the former regime. Now they had to pass in front of Churchill, who laughed in his sleeve. Persian Army. 12. Sarhang Garzan, the Assistant Chief of the General Staff, is officiating as military secretary in addition to his other duties. It appears that General Razmara, on appointment as Chief of the General Staff, protested strongly against the removal of this department from under the control of the General Staff to that of the Ministry for War. 13. The Chief of the General Staff has asked the British Military Attache to procure for the Persian army the following material, which, he said, was most urgently needed for operations in Kurdistan and other areas :— Mortars, 2-inch : 100, with 500 rounds apiece. Mortars, 3-inch : 100, with 500 rounds apiece. Verey pistols, 1-inch : 100. Cartridges, illuminating : 30,000. Grenades, No. 36 : 20,000. In stressing the need for the above the Chief of the General Staff said that, while in Kurdistan recently, he had found their field artillery useless as lacking the high trajectory required to bring fire to bear upon positions on the reverse slopes of mountains. So much of the fighting had been at close quarters that even mountain artillery had proved ineffective and that a mortar seemed to him the ideal weapon for “winkling out'’ Kurds from sangars and setting them on the run, where they could be dealt with by long-range machine guns or by mountain artillery fire. He also mentioned that large quantities of hand grenades had been found in positions captured from the Kurds. When questioned as to their origin the Kurds had said they had been purchased from Czechoslovakia by the Kurdish army authorities, but the Chief of the General Staff made no attempt to conceal his conviction that it was the Russians who had supplied them. He also referred humourously to a type of “ Molotov Cocktail ” used by the Kurds against Persian army tanks and M.T., but unpopular with them on the grounds that the ingredients tended to exude from the stopper in the great heat, to adhere to their baggy trousers and cause the contraption to become a greater menace to the thrower than to his opponent.14. Reference paragraph 15 of Intelligence Summary No. 26, Sarlashgar Ruhullah Kaikavusi did not proceed to Sweden. Investigations at the arms factories in his charge, according to the Minister for War, disclosed peculation on a large scale and he is now under arrest. ^ Appointments. 15. —(i) Sartip Muzayyini from Chief of the Personnel Department (Anglico military secretary) to resume command of the Ilnd Tehran Division vice Sartip Hushmand Afshar. The reason for Afshar’s removal was given by the Minister for War to the British Military Attache as alcoholism, but the fact that this officer (who was commanding in Kurdistan prior to General Humayuni) was a close friend of General Hasan Arfa has probably something to do with the change. (ii) Sarhang Husain Mahin from Chief of the 2nd Bureau, General Staff, to be second in command at the Officers’ Training College. (iii) Sarhang Abdullah Bahrami to be General Officer Commanding Vth Luristan Division vice Sarhang Hashimi, appointed as inspector in the Ministry for War.

Louis Saillant, described as the secretary-general of the World Federation of Trade Unions, arrived in Tehran on the 19th July. The Court. 17. An obscure newspaper called Sap'idrud came out on the 18th July with a single-sheet supplement with the head-lines: “Divorce of Queen Fauzieh. Marriage of Marshal Stalin’s Daughter to His Imperial Majesty the Shah.” The Persians, credulous as they are, seem to be having some difficulty in swallowing this one. British Interests. 18. The Persian Government have notified their agreement to the reopening of the British Consulate at Resht, which has been closed since 1935. Russian Interests. 19. In the course of an interview with the editor of Rahbar, the Tudeh organ, the Soviet Ambassador denied the truth of rumours to the effect that Russia desired a port on the Persian Gulf.

Section 1. PERSIA. SECRET. 73li/Zi5/M] Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 29, Secret, for the Period WndJuly to 28^ July, 1946.'— (Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. dUl of 31.^ July; Received %th August) Copy No. 142 Persian Affairs. Political. &gt;r HIM The Shah has conferred the personal title of “ Jenab-i-Ashraf upon the Prime Minister in appreciation of the services which he has rendered to the country. In practice, a Persian Prime Minister is usually addressed by his title while in office and this act of the Shah’s is commonly understood to imply the conferment of it for life to Qawam-us-Saltaneh. 2. On the 21st July the Chief of the General Staff informed representatnes of the Persian press that, according to information received by the Ministry for War, the British warships seen off Abadan on the 17th July [s?c] had not entered Persian waters but had anchored in Iraqi waters. Khuzistan. Internal Security. 3. There have been no fresh disturbances in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com pany’s concessional area, but the situation, particularly in Abadan and Khoiram- shahr is very tense with the Arabs smarting under the blows recently inflicted on them by the Tudeh. , „ _ , . 4. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company expected further trouble on the 27th July which was a pay day when the'workers would realise that they had not received strike pay. Up to date no news of the expected outbreak has been received. 5. In Agha Jari the situation has improved with the arrest by the Persian military of Hafizullah Bakhtiari, a dangerous lunatic, with his two confederates Zubdeh and Durusti. 6. The commission of enquiry despatched by the Central Government seems to be actively pro-Tudeh. So far it has made no enquiries concerning the instiga tions to strike, the seizure by the strikers of 500 motor vehicles belonging to the company, the seizure of all communications during the strike and the acts which led to the murderous attack by the Tudeh mob on the 15th Julv on the Arab Union’s headquarters. The commission so far has busied itself with hearing faked evidence of extensive gun-running by the Arabs. Azerbaijan. 7. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General at Tabriz who recently visited Khoi, Julfa and Maku, reports that there is no truth in the report that the Kurds had taken over local government in Khoi. He states that the Azerbaijan Democrat Administration is in complete control of Khoi and, indeed, of all the places which he visited. 8. The first party of Armenian emigrants left Tabriz by rail for Envan on the 20th July. Other parties were due to follow on the 26th and 31st July. In all 6,000 are to go. . . , A L .. ^ 9. Muhammad Biriya, the Minister of Education m the Azerbaijan Govern ment, at a meeting in Tabriz on the 24th July, at which Dr. Javid the Governor- General was also 'present, made a highly inflammatory speech on the subject of the recent strikes in Abadan and elsewhere in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's concessional area. He made a direct accusation of murder against the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, stating that, instead of meeting their objections, the company opened fire with machine guns on the unarmed workers killing 46 and wounding 170. He went on to say that he had telegraphed to the Persian Prime Minister^demanding the trial of the murderers and stating that if the Persian Government would not act, he would lead his Azerbaijanis to the rescue of the Abadan workers. [■80—911 bKhorasan. 10. Security on the highways has deteriorated. On the 26th July six buses and a passenger car were held up and their occupants robbed near Shahrud. 11. His Majesty's Consul-General at Meshed reports that Qawam-us- Saltaneh’s new party is not making great headway. This is due to an unfortunate choice of a local representative in the person of one Rahimian who was till recently and probably still is, a staunch Tudeh supporter. The professional anlj^. upper classes and the religious leaders are, therefore, highly suspicious of l Qawam’s intentions and are holding aloof, but some Government officials are-• joining out of fear of losing their jobs. Kermanshah. 12. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company officials in Kermanshah fear that ludeh elements may seize the opportunity of the absence of a Governor-General (Nikpay has been recalled to Tehran, see paragraph 16 below) to create disturbances in the town and in the refinery. They predict that the Police will not intervene to preserve order in view of the treatment they received after the 1st May disorders, when the ringleaders whom they had arrested were set free and the Chief of Police was himself arrested. Bakhtiari. 13. x\ccording to Abul Qasim Bakhtiari, Jehanshah Khan, a son of Murtoza Quli Khan, is to replace the weak Amir Husein Khan as his co-governor. According to the same source Amir Husein, by way of compensation, is to be elected to the next Majlis as one of the Bakhtiari deputies. 14. Abul Qasim Khan stated to His Majesty’s Consul at Isfahan that, while in Tehran recently, he had received a credit from the Ministry of Roads and Communications to provide for the construction of two new roads in Bakhtiari. The first will run from Shahr Kurd (1-39 U. Q4963) to Lurdokan, chief place of the Janoki Sardsir (H-39 C. V5272), and the other from Shahr Kurd to Ardal in Pusht Kuh (H-39 C. Q3424). These two roads would follow the existing track from Shahr Kurd to Gahru (1-39 U. Q5627) where the Ardal road would turn off south past the Chaqkhor plain and through the Zirreh range to Ardal (there is already a track part of the way as far as point Q4592). The Janeki road would go on from Gahru through Ganduman (H-39 D. Q8213) Pul-i-Karreh which must be rebuilt, Abul Qasim Khan having destroyed it when a rebel in 1942 (H. 39 D. V8879) and thence to Lurdekan. There already is a motorable track as far as Dorahan (H-39 D. V8787). 15. His Majesty’s Consul Isfahan reports a brisker trade in Government rifles in his area, the chief purchasers being large landowners and tribesmen. Average prices for a complete Persian Army rifle of B.R.N.O. pattern are from 7,000 to 8,000 rials, and about 5,000 rials for the complete components which are sometimes stocked up locally. This illicit trade is said to be well organised through Persian Army officers employed in the arsenal at Tehran. In this con nexion it is interesting to note that the Minister for War, when commenting to the British military attache on the arrest of General Kaikavusi (see para graph 14 of last Intelligence Summary) said that preliminary investigations indicated gross negligence on Kaikavusi’s part in the proper supervision of his subordinates rather than peculation for his own advantage. A ffointments. A.— Civil. 16. —(i) Farajullah Asif, Amir Muazzam. to be Governor-General of Kurdistan, vice Asadullah Arai, Shahab-ud-Dowleh, K.C.V.O., recalled on account of old age. Farajullah is a son of Asif-i-Azam and was Governor of Kurdistan from June 1942 to September 1943. He was a Deputy in the 9th, 13th and 14th Majlises. Kurdistan is not, properly speaking, an “ Ustandari ” (Governorate General) but was a “ Farmandari ” (Governorate) under the Governor-General of Kermanshah. Two years ago, when the troubles in Kurdistan were at their worst, as the result of recommendations by Fahimi, who went there on a mission of enquiry, the status was raised to that of Governor-General in order to improve the standing of Shahab-ud-Dowleh vis-a-vis the Divisional Commander and also to dispel the idea of a reduction in the rank of Shahab-ud-Dowleh, himself an ex-Governor-General of Fars. (ii) Ghulam Husein Ashrafi, Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, to be Governor-General of the IXth Ustan (Khorasan) vice Nasir Quli Itimadi, Nasr-ud-Dowleh recalled.(iii) Ahmad Salahi, Salah-ul-Mulk. to he Governor-General of the Vth Ustan (Kermanshah) vice Nikpay recalled. Salahi was born in Tehran in 1897. Educated at the Tehran School of Political Science and entered the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1912. Later he transferred to the Ministry of Education and later still to the Ministry of the Interior. Governor of Qum 1941-43 and Governor of Kermanshah for a short period in 1943. Governor of Ramadan, ^^December 1945. While Governor of Qum he was considered very co-operative * by the British Military authorities there, but was adversely commented on by British Consular authorities in Ramadan as lazy, timorous and dishonest. His subservience to the Tudeh was in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Sardar Akram. (iv) Azizullah Nikpay, Ezaz-ul-Dowleh, to be Parliamentary Under secretary to the Prime Minister vice Ashrafi. (v) Dr. Abbas Nafisi, a son of Dr. Muadeb Nafisi (F.O. 152), to be Under secretary in the Ministry of Health. (vi) Mustashari to be Governor of Shahrud. (vii) Muhammad Fahimi to be Counsellor to the Persian Legation in Rome. (viii) Muhsin Midhat to be Counsellor to the Persian Legation in Czecho slovakia. (ix) Dr. Amir Aslani to be secretary to the Persian Legation in (Czecho slovakia. B.— Military. (i) Sartip Shori to be Deputy Chief of the General Staff. He is a connexion by marriage of Sarlashgar Razmara and was appointed by him as G.O.C., Mekran Division, in 1944, relieving Sarlashgar Afkhami. He was recalled by General Arfa when Chief of the General Staff ostensibly on the grounds of dishonesty (probably well founded). (ii) Sarhang Mahmud Amini to be Persian Military Attache in Paris. This officer was one of the Persian army contingent which took part in the recent Victory Celebrations in London. He is one of the eight sons of Mohsin Amini, Amin-ud-Dowleh. (iii) Sartip Vahdati to be Assistant Accountant-General. (iv) Sarhang Fariduni to be Frontier Commissioner at Khawf. (v) Sarhang Shamlu to be Frontier Commissioner at Quchan. The Persian Army. 17. The Ministry for War is endeavouring to obtain from India large supplies of clothing and materials. The first list was discussed with the Govern ment of India by the Indian Government Trade Commission in Persia when on a recent visit to India. Without waiting to learn the outcome of these discussions the Ministry for War somewhat precipitately despatched a Colonel Gharib to India with a second and even larger list of requirements. During the past three years General Ridley’s military mission has, naturally, induced tne Ministry for War to place its orders in America, hut a shortage of dollars has now compelled the Ministry to turn to India as a source of supply as, a few months ago. it turned to the United Kingdom for other supplies the list of which was transmitted to the D.O.T. by the commercial secretary of this embassy. The Minister for War has asked His Majesty’s Ambassador to make strong recommendations to the Government of India to obtain the necessary export licences, but it is clear that he does not appreciate the difficult situation in India with regard to textiles and the necessity for the measures which the Government of India has had to take to conserve its stocks to meet India’s internal needs. By sending an officer to India and thus short circuiting the Persian Government’s trade representative in India it is obvious that the Ministry for War is bent on securing the utmost possible without consideration of Persia’s civilian needs, but it is improbable that the Government of India will permit the export of these materials without deducting them from Persia’s quota. The more important items in the two lists are as follows :— Woollen overcoat cloth (yards) Woollen battledress cloth (yards) K.D. (yards) Boots (pairs) Calico (yards) Tents ... Blankets Water bottles Mess tins Sun helmets ... 1.240.000 1.280.000 1,300.000 450.000 3.500.000 4.500 575.000 50.000 50.000 20.000 [80—91] b 24 18. Two new divisions have been formed, the 11th (t 1 an, Minister for at Resht, and the 12th Gurgan, with headquarters at Gurgan. . War informed the British Military Attache that for reasons o P S lrj new formations were termed divisions, but that, for the presen , (( . ,, not be more than a brigade apiece. He further stated that the Res . £ contained three infantry battalions and the Gurgan WO A. i battalions and a cavalry regiment. In answer to the British . i i aij ac e f oj question whether these two new formations could be found 0 a , s / of 84,000 which, it was believed, had been suggested by General Ridley, u ge e for by Dr. Millspaugh and agreed to by the Ministry for War, the Minister replied that he was now working on a total strength of 100,000. 19. On the advice of General Ridley, the Ministry for War has agreed to the disbandment of the Mechanised Brigade. This expensive toy was oi little use and the comparatively large amount of M.T. locked up for the use ot the small number of men comprising it can. in the opinion of the American Military Mission, be more profitably employed elsewhere. Persian Gendarmerie. 20. The commission which was despatched to Khamseh (Zenj an) and Azer baijan to discuss the future organisation of the gendarmerie in these provinces has submitted its recommendations to the Ministry for the Interior (see paragraph 17 of Intelligence Summary No. 25). Colonel Schwarzkopf informed the British Military Attache that he had not yet seen the recommendations regarding Azerbaijan, but that in respect of Khamseh the commission had recom mended the absorbtion of the Democrat ‘ Fidais ' of that province into one battalion of gendarmes. The Democrats had agreed to accept a commanding officer and two out of four company commanders from the Central Gendarmerie. The remaining officers are to be found from the “ Fidais.' Communications. 21. A press communique states that by a decision of the Ministry for Roads and Communications the section of the railway line Kazvin-Mianeh has been separated from the Central Railway Administration and will, in future, form an independent section termed the North-Western Railway. Steps are being taken to verify the truth of this report which, on the fact of it, seems hardly creditable. In the first place the Minister for Roads and Communications has not the power to make such a decision. Secondly, though in actual fact the Democrats control the railway from Khurramdarrah (50 miles beyond Kazvin) to Mianeh it is unbeliev able that the Persian Government should thus recognise their independence and make them a present of this section of railway more especially since a credit has recently been given to provide for the extension of the line from Mianeh to Tabriz. Economic. 22. A company has been formed in Isfahan with a capital of 10 million rials to link up the Kuhrang waters with the Zayandehrud. Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners have made the necessary survey and report favourably on the possibility of construction. Up to the present 2,500,000 rials have been paid up by the public and another 500,000 is expected shortly. The dam will take five years to construct. The same firm has also been examining projects for a water supply for Shiraz town. The Press 23. The chief topics have been the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company strikes the arrival (completely untrue) of three British cruisers in Persian waters and the activities of M. Louis Saillant. The Tudeh organ Rahbar gives an indication of the programme and slogans to be adopted in the meetings which will be held throughout the country on Persian Constitution Day, 14th Mordad (5th August) They are as follows :— (1) The necessity of Persia participating in the Peace Conference (2) The freedoms gained by the democratic revolt of Azerbaijan to be extended throughout the country. (3) Clean up of the ruling classes; prosecution and punishment of those responsible for the killings in Khuzistan and Somnan (4) Investigation of the military coup d'Etat in Kerman and the establish ment of individual and collective security, particularly for peasants throughout Persia. J r (5) Non-intervention of the A.I.O.C. in Persian internal affairs.5 Hi ft' The Court. 24. Her Royal Highness Princess Ashraf and her suite returned to Tehran from their tour in Russia on the 24th July. Much prominence has been given in the Persian press to the interviews between Princess Ashraf and Marshal Stalin at which the only other person present was M. Molotov and to the decoration of e Princess by Stalin with the “ Red Flag of Labour.” The Minister for War o informed the British Military Attache that General Shafai, the Persian Military Attache in Moscow, who accompanied the party, had been presented with a gold sword. (With a malicious grin General Ahmedi said that he had advised General Shafai, as an ex-chief of the arsenal, to have the sword assayed, lest a change for the worse in his relations with the Russians might render it necessary for him to pawn it.)PXT ^ / C 7 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT August 14, 1946.

Section 1. 7896/315/34] Copy No. 142 Military Attache s Intelligence Summary No. 30, Secret, for the Period 21)th July to ^th August, 1946 .—{Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 312 of Ith August; Received \Mh August.) PERSIA. Persian Affairs. Political. ON the 31st July at 6 p.m. the Council of Ministers was assembled and awaiting the arrival of the Prime Minister for a routine meeting. At 6‘15 p.m. Muzaftar Firuz arrived and asked them to begin as he had a communication to make to them from the Prime Minister. He called upon the Minister of Finance to read the message, which was to the effect that Qawam-us-Saltaneh thanked them for the collaboration, that circumstances rendered necessary a reconstitution of the Cabinet on a coalition basis and that in order to leave his hands free he called upon them all to resign forthwith. So thunderstruck were they at this completely unexpected development that they all meekly assented and signed the message in token of acceptance. The Minister for War, who informed the Shah a few minutes later, found him in complete ignorance of the affair and much perturbed by it and it was not till 9 a.m. on the following day that Qawam-us- Saltaneh sought an audience to inform the Shah of what he had done and of the names of the persons he proposed to include in his new Cabinet (see paragraph 2 below). It is generally thought that Qawam-us-Saltaneh, having decided to stage this minor coup d'Etat on his own. feared to inform the Shah in advance lest His Imperial Majesty were to go one better and dismiss him—an act which, in the absence of a Majlis, he had the constitutional right to do. 2. The new Cabinet is as follows :— (1) Prime Minister, Minister of Interior and Minister for Foreign Affairs: Ahmad Qawam, Qawam-us-Saltaneh (F.O. 183; M.A. 295). (2) Minister for War: Sipahbud Ahmedi (F.O. 16; M.A. 21). (3) Minister of Finance : Abdul Husein Hazhir (F.O. 79; M.A. 104). (4) Minister without portfolio: Anushirwan Sipahbudi (F.O. 205: M.A. 282). (5) Minister of Roads and Communications: General Muhammad Husein Mirza Firuz (F.O. 72; M.A. 94). (6) Minister of Justice : Allahyar Saleh (F.O. 198; M.A. 253). (7) Minister of Posts and Telegraphs : Dr. Manuchihr Iqbal (F.O. 94). (8) Minister of Agriculture : Shams-ud-Din Amir Alai. (9) Minister of Labour, of Social Affairs and Propaganda and Political Under-Secretary of State to the Prime Minister : Muzaffar Firuz (Appendix A to Intelligence Summary No. 7 and Appendix to Intelligence Summary No. 28). (10) Minister of Commerce and Industry : Iraj Iskandari. (11) Minister of Public Health : Dr. Murteza Yazdi. (12) Minister of Education : Dr. Kishavarz. Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 8 hold the same appointments as in the previous Cabinet. No. 7 exchanges Public Health for Posts and Telegraphs. No. 4 has now no portfolio. No. 3 was Minister of Finance in Hakimi’s Cabinet. No. 5 was for a few weeks Minister of Interior in Hakimi’s last Cabinet and leads the “ Iran ” Party which recently amalgamated with the Tudeh Party. Nos. 10, 11 and 12 are newcomers to Cabinet rank. Short personality notes on them are given in an Appendix to this Summary. 3. According to the Minister for War and the President of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce great consternation has been caused by the recent Cabinet changes and the general impression is that complete subservience to Russian demands will ensue. The issue of a proclamation by the Prime Minister (see paragraph 4 below) has deepened the gloom and leads many to think that its [80—110]ominous threats and restrictions will but serve to keep the ring while Russian policy is carried out. Conviction that the Democrat Party of Iran was but an electioneering gambit grows and some people predict its early demise by absorp tion in the Tudeh. According to General Ahmedi in the latter days of the last Cabinet (i.e., after the dismissal of Muwarrikh-ud-Dowleh and the rupture between Bahar and the Russians) on political issues in which Russia s interests were concerned or on questions on which the Russians had made known their view* the voting in the Cabinet was usually four to three, Qawam-us-Saltaneh, General Firuz, Amir Alai and Zuka-ud-Dowleh taking the Russian side and General Ahmedi, Bahar and Dr. Iqbal the other. Sipahbudi usually contrived to avoid voting at all and Bay at’s loutish brain rarely grasped the point at issue before the voting was completed. As the general pointed out, the present set-up is much less balanced and the expected score is 8 to 3, i.e., Qawam-us-Saltaneh, General Firuz, Saleh. Amir Alai, Muzaffar Firuz and the three Tudeh members v. Ahmedi, Hazhir and Dr. Iqbal, with the possible addition of Sipahbudi who, after a life career in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, is displeased at being deprived of his portfolio. Further cause for alarm is given by a rumour that the Prime Minister intends to include one or more of the members of the Azerbaijan National Government in his Cabinet as Ministers without portfolio. 4. On the 3rd August a communique was published by the Persian Prime Minister. After explaining that the need for national unity had forced him to make changes in his Cabinet he went on to explain the principal points in his Government's programme as follows :— (i) Progressive national economy and the encouragement of Persian capital for the benefit of new industries and of agriculture. (ii) Reallotment of the budget to make better provision for Education, Health, Industry and Agriculture. (iii) Revision of the law within the framework of the United Nations Charter. (iv) Summary and condign punishment for all embezzlers, armed bandits and disturbers of the peace. (v) Setting up of special courts to try traitors. (vi) Reviewing the relations between landlord and tenant. (vii) Agricultural reforms, including the distribution of Crown Lands among the peasants. (viii) A complete overhaul of the country’s financial system. (ix) A drive against unemployment and the improvement of the lot of the workers by strict enforcement of the new Labour Law. Turning to foreign policy, the Prime Minister repeated that he based this upon the maintenance of friendly relations with all countries and especially with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States. He insisted upon maintaining the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Persia and he would repeat that he would brook no interference by any foreign Power in Persia's internal affairs. To effect this the following rules would be strictly enforced :— (1) For the future all contact with embassies and legations is prohibited to all Persians except State officials whose duties require them to enter into relations with foreign missions and who have been authorised to do so by their official superiors. Those who contravene this injunction will be at once dismissed. (2) Persians not in State employ nor connected with foreign missions shall abstain from all contacts with them. The Prime Minister went on to say that he, for his part, would enforce these regulations to the utmost, and that he called upon all foreign embassies, lega tions and consulates to abstain from all contacts save those arising out of official business. 5. On the 2nd August a B.B.C. broadcast repeated a communique from the Government of India to the effect that, “ in order that they may be at hand for the protection, should circumstances demand it, of Indian, British and Arab lives and in order to safeguard Indian and British interests in South Persia, troops are being sent from India to Basra. There are many hundreds of Indians employed in the oilfields and refineries in South Persia and India depends largely on this source for her vital supplies of petrol.” A subsequent news item from the same source stated that “ it is learnt from General Headquarters that the force sent from India to Basra is a brigade group. There is no question, it is stated officially, of troops going into Persia, except in the case of grave emergency, which, it is hoped, will not arise.'' The reference to the Arabs was unfortunateand may be exploited by the Left-wing press, who have consistently accused His Majesty's Government and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company of stirring up the Arabs to fight the innocent Tudeh. A little thought would make it clear to the average Persian that a decision to take some precautionary measures must have been made by His Majesty's Government several weeks ago when the troubles in Khuzistan first assumed serious proportions. A little more thought would ^nake it clear that the move of a brigade group from India to Basra could not have been achieved overnight. In spite of this, however, there are many who will believe that this movement of troops is His Majesty’s Government’s counter move to the recent reconstitution of the Cabinet. Internal Security. Khuzistan. 6. Another infantry battalion, making three in all, has been sent to Ahwaz as reinforcements. It left Tehran on the 1st August. The Chief of the General Staff informed the British Military Attache that the battalion was from Mekran and, being composed of Baluchis, would be more immune to I udeh propaganda. According to the General Officer Commanding, Khuzistan, as reported by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, one infantry company stationed at Abadan, belonging to a locally recruited infantry battalion, had become infected with this propaganda. . 7. The Indian artisans employed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have been trying to force the company’s hand. About seven hundred of them handed in their passports and demanded repatriation to India. Much of their discon tent, it is believed, is due to the unsatisfactory conduct of the Indian \\ elfare Officer, who is more concerned with drawing his large salary than in investigating the complaints of Indian workers. } 8. Though no fresh disturbances have taken place at any of the company s installations, the situation is still precarious with the Arabs straining at the leash to avenge themselves upon the Tudeh. At Agha Jari some disappointment has been felt by the release by the Central Government of Hafizullah, Zubdeh and Durusti, who had been arrested and deported to Tehran by the local military authorities (see paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary). East Persia. 9. From a consular source it is learned that the closure of the Soviet Consular Agency at Zabul has not yet been effected. On the 23rd July the Soviet Vice-Consul from Meshed and two Russian military officers arrived at Zabul, and after a five days’ stay left for Birjand. Isfahan. 10 A branch of V.O.K.S., the Russo-Persian Cultural Society, has been opened at Isfahan. Ismail Mirza, a brother of Sarem-ud-Dowleh, has accepted the presidentship (after asking His Britannic Majesty's Consul if there was any harm in his doing so!). Apart from him, the remaining members are small fry with political rather than cultural leanings. Economic. 11. In official circles there is some apprehension over the recent discus sions regarding a minimum wage of workers (see paragraph 9 of Intelligence Summary No. 28). It has just been realised, apparently, that a minimum wage will have to be adopted universally and not only by the Anglo-Iraman Oil Com pany. The Government mines, about fourteen in number, the four Government textile mills the seven Government sugar factories and the six other factoi les in and around Tehran will all be affected. They have all been running at a con- siderable loss for many years through mismanagement and peculation, and the load imposed by these increases in wages will impose on the Government’s finances a heavier strain than they can bear. A ppoiritments. A.— 'Civil. 12 —(i) Abbas Iskandari to be Governor-General of Tehran. This is a newly created appointment, Tehran having been hitherto only a governorate. Abbas is a nephew of the late Suleiman Mirza, a Qajar prince who founded the Tudeh Party and died about two years ago. He is a brother of Inaj. In business circles4 he has an unsavoury reputation, and some three years ago he departed very suddenly to Cairo, having decamped, it was subsequently learned, with a large portion of the funds of the Iran Insurance Company. (ii) Muhammad Vali Mirza Farmanfarmayan (F.O. 73) to be president of the Caspian Fisheries Board. (iii) Mehdi Quli Mirza Muzaffari, a son of the late Prince Nusrat-us- Saltaneh, G.C.V.O., to be Governor of Arak (Siiltanabad). (iv) Husain Diba to be counsellor at the Persian Legation in Brussels. (v) Muhammad Hasan Kabiri to be Governor of Maku. (vi) Dr. Mihtash to be Governor of Tabriz and Deputy Governor-General of Eastern and Western Azerbaijan. B.— M Hit ary. Sartip Reza Jawadi to be Chief Engineer vice Sartip Bayendor, appointed G.O.C., Khorasan Division. Legislation. 13. The text of the Persian Government’s Labour Law, passed on the 18th May by the Council of Ministers (referred to in paragraph 10 of Intelligence Summary No. 20), has now been received. It is styled “ Decree for Experimental Enforcement.'’ The draft law, for it amounts to such, is to be laid before the Majlis at the beginning of the fifteenth term. It contains forty-eight articles and promises additional legislation to elaborate numerous points, of which the chief are:— Classification of industries; special laws to govern agriculture; classifi cation of employment, e.g., heavy, dangerous, &amp;c.; the fixing of working hours for certain specified industries; the form of contract between employer and employee; health regulations; rules governing employment agencies; the conduct of trade unions’ affairs; how wages are to be paid; rates of pay; workers’ councils; the functions of the Supreme Labour Council; workers’ funds. Despite this formidable list of legislation not yet enacted, the new Labour Law is more definite and seems more practicable than any piece of Persian law hitherto seen. The Court. 14. Prince Ahmed Reza and Prince Hamid Reza (the fifth and seventh sons of the late Reza Shah by his third queen, Esmet-ul-Muluk) have left for Paris to continue their studies. Appendix. Dr. Kishavarz.

Persian Affairs. Political. GREAT satisfaction is expressed at Persia’s success in obtaining a seat at the Peace Conference and the Leftist press are loud in their praises of the Russian delegate in supporting Persia’s claim. r l he delegation has left Ly an. comprises Anushirwan Sipahbudi, Minister without Portfolio m the picsen Cabinet and a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fazlullah Aabil, head of the Third Political Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and a junior official Hoveida, a relative of Sipahbudi’s, as secretary. Mr. Eden s highly compli mentary but unfortunate phrase describing Persia as The Bridge of Victory has been made much of and expanded into the incredible statement that no country (sic) has suffered greater losses in the late war than Persia. ihe Persian, with his airy disregard of historical truth, as the years pass by will probably come to believe that it was the hosts of Darius who, unaided, brought Hitler to his knees 2. The delegation from Azerbaijan referred to in paragraph 9 of last Intelligence Summary is now engaged in conversations with the Persian Govern ment but no official communique as to the results so far obtained has been issued. 3. Two more political arrests have been made. One was Dr. Taheri, a member for Yezd in the last Majlis, a strong advocate of good relations with Great Britain, a supporter of Seyyid Zia and a man of much influence inside and outside of the Majlis. With his disappearance the political arena is almost clear of any opponent to Qawam-us-Saltaneh and the Tudeh in the next elections. The other arrest was that of Hisam-ud-din Daulatabadi elected for Isfahan by the mill owning interest in the last elections, a clever and intriguing man whose opposition to Qawam’s present policy was well known. Reference paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary, it now appears that four and not three of Sheikh Husein Lankorani’s brothers were arrested with him, their names, as given in the press, being Ahmad, Hisam-ud-din, Murteza and Mustafa. Nothing is known of their antecedents. 4. Some stir has been caused by an alleged broadcast by the B.B.C. to the effect that Abdullah Khazal, son of the late Sheikh of Muhammerah. was proceeding to Cairo to plead before the Arab League the case of the Arabs of Khuzistan. A statement on the same subject attributed by the press to King Ibn Saud added fuel to these flames. Chassib Khazal, Abdullah’s eldest brother, has since sent a telegram to the Persian Prime Minister in which he assures the Persian Government of the loyalty of its Arab subjects in Khuzistan. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 5. According to the Chief of the General Staff there is a slight improvement in the situation in Kurdistan. He informed the British military attache on the 22nd August that Qazi Muhammad seemed to be losing his influence in areas other than his own zone of Mahabad. Amar Khan Shakkak continued to protest his loyalty to the Persian Government. Some other minor chieftains had left the “ front ” taking their armed contingents with them. Hama Rashid, as far as his information went, was trying to get into touch with the Iraqi Government with a view to his return. Mulla Mustafa Barzani was. therefore, the immediate problem. He had. the Chief of the General Staff knew, been receiving more assistance in arms and money from the Russians who now appeared to regerd him as a better bet than Qazi Muhammad. Mulla Mustafa himself had sent an emissary to the G.O.C. in Kurdistan saying that he was under pressure by the Russians and must soon make up his mind which side to adhere to. He could not, without Russian support, continue indefinitely to reside as an unwanted [81—53]guest among the Persian Kurds (at this juncture the Chief of the General Stalf quoted the well-known Turkish proverb to the effect that a fish and a guest both stink after three days) and that unless the Persian Government could use their influence to secure him a pardon from the Iraqi Government he must perforce throw in his lot with the Russians. A zerbaijan. 6. More tension between Kurds and Democrats in Western Azerbaijan id reported by His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General in Tabriz. In Rezaiyeh both sides are endeavouring to secure the power with the Kurds attempting to utilise for their own ends local opposition to the Democrats whether among Azerbaijanis discontented with the Democrat regime or among minorities such as the Assyrians. In Miandoab on the 10th August a force of Kurdish irregulars attempted to take over the administration but retired without fighting when faced with the Azerbaijan People’s army to which reinforcements had been sent from r l abriz. Bakhtiari-Fars. 7. A press report states that an alliance has been formed between the Bakhtiari and the Qashgai and that the leaders of these tribes (presumably Abul Qasim Bakhtiari and Nasir Qashgai) have pledged themselves to support Qawam-us-Saltaneh’s Government. Until more detailed information as to the scope of the alliance is received it would be premature to guess at the real motive behind it but one point is significant, i.e., the non-inclusion of Qawam-ul- Mulk who was a signatory to the Kuhruyieh Pact (referred to in paragraph 7 of Intelligence Summary No. 30/44 and paragraph 8 of Intelligence Summary No. 32/44) the other two being Nasir Qashgai and Murteza Quli Bakhtiari and it is reasonable to suppose that one object of the alliance is to undermine still further the influence of Qawam-ul-Mulk in Pars. Khuzistan. 8. The situation in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concessional area has slightly improved owing to further arrests of prominent agitators by the local Persian authorities. 9. Russian interest in the recent strikes and unrest does not flag and on the 11th August the Russian Consul, accompanied by six Russians, visited Abadan refinery. Khorasan. 10. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that the recent ban on intercourse between Persians and foreign embassies, legations and consulates has resulted in a virtual boycott of his consulate-general, only two Persians having visited it between the 3rd and 23rd August. The English classes, which are held in a house outside the consulate, continue to be well attended and no diminution in the number of pupils is evident. According to the same source the number of Persians visiting the Russian Consulate-General is still con siderable though less than before the imposition of the ban. Indeed, such a ban need affect Russian consular contacts but little since they have so many alternative approaches through their Cultural Society, their Travel Bureau their Air Service, their Trade Agency, their Transport Agency, their Bank and their Insurance Company. 11. Severe famine conditions are reported from the Kainat area whence a large number of people have migrated to Khorasan. Though there is a surplus of gram m Khorasan and Seistan the Persian Government do not seem to have considered the possibility of moving stocks to areas affected by the famine. I I he Press. 12. Most of the Left-wing papers continue to praise Russia for its suppori of Persia s request to be represented at the Peace Conference. They also iU, the need for making an early start with the elections, Rahbar (the £&lt; TudelU organ) naively adding that the agreement between Russia and Persia necessitate! this. /.afm. the organ of the Workers Union, came out with what is perhaps the most violently worded article yet written about the Anglo-Iranian Oi Company saying that the crimes of Hitler and Mussolini paled into insi^nificanci compared with the diabolical treatment accorded by the company to its Persiarworkers. As is usual in a Communist philippic, imperialism was placed in the dock alongside of capitalism and Britain was accused of trying to turn Khuzistan into a graveyard in her greed for oil. Persian Army. 13. A marriage allowance of 100 rials per mensem has been granted to ^Fwarrant officers. 14. A time scale for promotion for n.c.o.s has been introduced by the Ministry for War. It is as follows After six months’ service : promotion to trained soldier. After six months’ at a corporals’ school : promotion to corporal. After twelve months’ at a sergeants’ school : promotion to sergeant III class. After four years’ service : promotion to sergeant II class or sergeant I class. After five years’ service: promotion to company sergeant-major or regimental sergeant-major. 15. The Chief of the General Staff informed the British military attache that a further consignment of 48 guns (75-mm. mountain) had arrived, or were just about to arrive, in Khorramshahr from Bofors, Sweden. They were a further consignment out of the 200 guns of this type ordered by the Persian Government between 1933 and 1939 delivery of which was interrupted by the war. A Colonel Taqi Riahi has gone to Sweden to discuss future deliveries with this firm. According to the Chief of the General Staff the Ministry of War have a large credit there and they are now desirous of altering some of the orders placed (e.g., for a shell filling plant) to material for which they stand in greater need. 16. The Chief of the General Staff has stated that he is contemplating a new organisation for the army which will be better suited to Persia’s internal tactical needs. This new organisation is dependent on the arrival from Sweden of the balance of the order for 200 Bofors 75-mm. mountain guns originally placed by Reza Shah and of the 2-inch and 3-inch mortars for which the Persian army has recently made enquiries from the War Office and India. Up to 1941 only 120 of these guns had arrived; from this quantity the army lost fifty-four to the Russians in the operations of August 1941, and a further eight in Azerbaijan in December 1945, thereby reducing the total available to fifty-eight. Now a further forty-eight of the original order have arrived, or are due to arrive shortly, leaving a balance of thirty-two still to come. This will give the army an eventual total of 34^ batteries. The new organisation contemplated by the Chief of the General Staff aims at making the infantry regiment (“Hang-i- Piyadeh ”) the tactical unit complete with its own supporting arms. The organisation proposed is as follows :— Infantry regiment: 3 infantry battalions and 1 artillery battery of 4 mountain guns (under command). Infantry battalion : 3 companies of 3 rifle platoons and 1 close support platoon. Rifle platoon : 2 sections, each section having a commander and two sub-sections of six men. Close support platoon : 1 mortar section and 1 medium machine gun section. Persian Navy. 17. The Russians have announced their willingness to hand back to the Persian navy its vessels used by them during the late war on the Caspian Sea. As far as is known they consist of four boats of 80 tons displacement of the H.D.M.L. type and eight or ten small motor launches. A merican Interests. 18. Colonel Joseph K. Baker, American military attache in Tehran from 1943 to 1946 has been decorated by H.I.M. the Shah with the order of Humayun III Class. This decoration was also recently awarded to the outgoing Chinese and Belgian military attaches. The announcement in the press stated that this4 is the highest distinction bestowed upon foreign service attaches. Actually, the decoration the Persian Government intended to bestow upon Major-General Fraser on his departure but which General Fraser was not permitted to accept was the 1st Class of this order. 19.

His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed has been unable to confirm or deny the truth of Russian troop concentrations near Askabad. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General at Tabriz states that his American and Turkish colleagues had heard the same rumours of Russian con centrations at Julfa. The rumours, for such they appear to be, are circulated, probably as part of a war of nerves, by Caucasians and “ Muhajirs.” Tehran, ‘loth August, 1946.(• L &amp;(o d ^ f o^) THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

[E 9033/315/34] Copy No. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 34, Secret, for the 'period 26£A August to ls£ September, 1946.— {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 356 of \th September; Received Wth September.) 142 Persian Affairs. Political. YET another Supreme Council has been set up, this time for the drawing up of a seven-year plan of town planning and general development for Persia. There are some imposing names on the council including those of Eahim-ul-Mulk and Adi, shrewd men of much ministerial experience, Hazhir, the Minister of Finance, Drs. Said Malik, Roza Zadeh Shafaq and Sadiq, General Riazi, Nikpur, the President of the Chamber of Commerce, and Ali Vakili, a prominent financier and business man. 2. The Persian Ambassador in Washington has been making discreet enquiries from His Majesty's Government’s permanent representative at U.N.O. as to Persia’s chances of being elected to a seat on the Security Council of U.N.O. in place of Egypt and as to His Majesty’s Government’s reactions to such a request. Husain Ala seemed to think that his country could count on Russian support for this venture because M. Vyshinski had previously supported Persia’s claim to representation at the Paris Peace Conference. Realising, perhaps, that this allusion to Russia’s predicted attitude coupled with the Persian Govern ment’s present policy might give the impression that Russia was about to add another disciplined voter to her trained band of supporters, Mr. Ala hastened to add that Qawam-us-Saltaneh was “ standing up to Moscow pretty well ” and was not likely to allow himself to be dictated to by the Soviet Government. Mr. Ala would appear to be about due for a liaison visit to his motherland for a “ refresher course ” in her present politics. 3. The official Pars news agency issued a denial of “ certain foreign broadcast announcements ” to the effect that, at an interview with the American Ambassador, the Persian Prime Minister had complained to him of Russian interference in the north of Persia and of British interference in the south and had asked him to secure the mediation of the United States Government. In point of fact this very suggestion was made to the American Ambassador by the Persian Prime Minister. 4. In the press, in an account of a reception held on the 27th August by the Tudeh Party in honour of the Azerbaijan delegation at which the Persian Prime Minister and other notables were present, it was stated that, at the close of the party, the fusion of the Tudeh, Persian, Persian Democrat and Azerbaijan Democrat Parties was announced. This statement did not appear in all the newspapers and the report requires confirmation. Whatever the real objects of Qawam-us-Saltaneh’s new Persian Democrat Party were it was evident, from the outset, that open and firm opposition to the Tudeh was not one of them. It is, however, surprising that he should have been such a fool as to allow the fact to be publicly announced and thus forfeit his chances of gainino* the adherence of the centre and moderate Right elements in the country. Internal Security. Khuzistan. 5. A further improvement in the situation has been effected by the arrest of more Tudeh agitators. On the 20th August Muslih, Wafaizadeh and Nasir Island were arrested—Tarbiyat, Dashtipur and Safavi, whose arrest had been ordered have absconded and their present whereabouts is unknown. A number of persons found in possession of property looted during the disturbances of the 14th July have been arrested. Dabiri, the Tudeh leader at Masjid-i-Suleiman oilfields has been arrested and sent to Ahwaz. General Kupal, the Judge Advocate General, sent from Tehran to investigate the work of the military tribunal has changed three members of it, W'hile the above arrests have done [81—89] Bmuch to restrain the Tudeh, the effect will, it is feared, be only temporary, as so far no one has been tried and convicted and, in Persia, arrested persons tend to be liberated after a short while owing to lack of evidence upon which they can be brought to trial, the relevant dossiers having miraculously disappeared from the Public Prosecutor’s office. Bakhtian-Fars. 6. Some information is now available concerning the Bakhtiari-Qashgai pact referred to in paragraph 7 of last Intelligence Summary. It was supplied to His Majesty’s Consul at Isfahan by Choragh Ali Khan, a younger brother of Murteza Quli Khan, who, in the past, has proved a fairly reliable informant. He stated that the agreement consisted of three clauses, viz :—firstly, that the two tribes pledge themselves to be obedient to the Central Government; secondly, that they will join in punishing raiders in the territory of either; thirdly, that they will unite in defence against aggression by outside parties. By “outside parties ’’ presumably the Tudeh is meant for it is known that both tribes are very concerned with the spread of Tudeh influence towards the south. 7. Martial law was proclaimed in Shiraz on the 28th August with a 10 p.m. curfew and a prohibition against carrying arms. The exact reason for this step is not known but it may be in connexion with a rumoured plot on the part of the Bakhtiari and Qashgai to seize the towns of Isfahan and Shiraz respectively, to liquidate the Tudeh and to take over the Government. Khosro Qashgai has been summoned to Tehran by a cypher message from his temporary associate Muzaffar Firuz stating that he would hear something to his advantage. A further possible cause of unrest in Shiraz is the receipt of an order from Tehran to arrest one Khavari who was Seyyid Zia's agent there. The Governor- General is reported to have replied that he dared not arrest him but that he had surpressed his newspaper. Following the proclamation of martial law there was a scuffle at the Tudeh Party’s headquarters arising out of an attempt by the police to remove their loudspeaker. The military fired a few shots in the air and the Tudeh rioters fled. 8. Some stir has been caused by the receipt in Tehran of a manifesto from the people of the south which is reproduced as Appendix “ A ” to this summary. How close a connexion this has with the rumoured plots of the Bakhtiari and Qashgai referred to above is not yet known but it is certain that some trouble is brewing in the south and that other tribes, such as the Saveh branch of the Shahsavans, the main Shahsavan tribe of Ardebil and the Afshars of Ardalan are aware of it. 9. M. Nicolas Denissov, the Soviet Vice-Consul from Isfahan, accompanied by a secretary named Pietro Koulikof, have arrived in Shiraz to open a Soviet consulate there. Kurdistan. 10. Some confirmation of the remarks made by the Chief of the General Staff in respect of Mulla Mustafa Barzani (see paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary) is afforded by a report from His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah to the effect that Ghazi Muhamamd of Mahabad has been superseded as head of the Komala movement by Mulla Mustafa and that the change was made at the instigation of the Russians. Azerbaijan. 11. The Soviet Railway Commission (referred to in paragraph 5 of Intelligence Summary No. 25) has arrived in Tabriz and is proceeding with the handing over of the Julfa-Tabriz railway. 12. The Azerbaijan delegation is still in Tehran and, though no official communique has been made concerning the negotiations, it is believed that they are at a standstill. In the meanwhile, according to His Majesty’s Acting Consul- General at Tabriz, the Provincial Council, apparently without reference to Tehran, have appointed Daneshian, Deputy Minister for Defence in the former National Government, as commandant of the Azerbaijan gendarmerie, which consists of the entire body of the “ Fidais.’’ Daneshian, according to the same source, has also been commissioned to organise the gendarmerie in Mahabad, but it is not yet known whether the Kurds will agree to this. 13. The Democrats and Kurds have failed to come to any agreement over Rezaiyeh and both sides maintain patrols inside the town though the surrounding- villages are in Kurdish hands.Kermanshah. 14. Considerable extension of Tudeh influence in the Kermanshah district is expected as the result of the activities of Alawi, the Provincial Director of Education. He has started an attack on the newspaper Kermanshah, whose tone was mild and friendly to the British and intends to leave as the sole possessor of the journalistic field the Fudeh organ Bisitun. He is also appointing teachers of known Tudeh sympathies to the important schools. Communications. A five-year construction programme has been approved by the Council or Ministers. 1 his programme is the first of two five-year plans. A summary of it is given in Appendix ‘ B to this Summary. 16.

Appendix A. Alarm!—Proclamation by “ The Resistance Movement of the South:' Dear Countrymen! Unfortunately the hour of danger is approaching. The unfortunate hour which was avoided by us is now coming and the mass disturbers, after five vears of war of nerves and undesirable preparations at the cost of the freedom, indepen dence and integrity of Iran, are now sitting in the seats of the Ministries and taking into their hands the fate of the oppressed people of the countrv. L T nfor- tunately, it is seen that those who were condemned for Communist doctrines and organisations and those who had records of espionage against this countrv. have [81 89j b 24 now occupied the seats of the Ministries under the name of Tudeh leaders and are ruling over 15 millions of patriotic Moslem Persians. To tolerate more than this is not possible. It cannot be called anything other than gradual dishonour able death and surrender to the rule of the Communist disturbers and anarchists. Qavam, who took the reins of the Government six months ago, was respected and supported by the people of Persia for the purpose of eradicating the illegitimate interference of foreigners in the internal affairs of Persia, and smashing the feet of the mischief makers of the stateless Tudeh Party people in the arena of Persian^^ policy. Therefore, any pressure brought by the Qavam's Government on the people of Persia was resisted bitterly. Our statesmen, who were nationalists and patriots, were sent to jail without any fault and the press which was considered the tongue of the people and the fourth column of democracy, was suppressed. The intolerable pressures of taxes and the cost of living were enhanced, but these undesirable deprivations were tolerated in the hope that foreign influence might be eradicated in the country and subversive elements of irreligious disturbers pro hibited from interfering in the internal affairs of Persia. Unfortunately, not only were these expectations not realised, but it was a prelude to the rule of the Tudeh leaders. It is seen that five important Ministries were occupied by the Tudeh leaders. Dear countrymen, our patience is running out and it is intolerable to see the education of our boys and girls left to the Tudeh ministers. According to the party programme, the inclusion of religion in the school programmes will be considered as reactionary. In this case, atheism will be taught in our schools. We, the Resistance Movement of the South, are those who are not prepared to listen to the radio and hear statements made against our religion, nationality, &amp;c. We are not a people to be cold-blooded in the face of any accusation and abuse. As it is proved by history, we have showed our resistance during long years in the face of the world powers and no power could fight with us. The faithful members of the Resistance Movement of the South have arranged their organisations from long ago on the tops of the mountains and in the depths of the valleys and forests of the south. No positive action has been shown against the Tudeh disturbers. But to-day, when it is proved in action that the head of the Government is intimi dated by foreign political activities, so that he believes that the participation of the Tudeh leaders in the Cabinet is necessitated, we deem it necessary to utilise our legitimate privilege and declare to the people and the Government of Persia and also to the democratic Governments and peoples of the world, that due to the fact that the Resistance Movement of the South sees the participation of the Tudeh leaders in the Cabinet as open interference of foreign policy in Persian affairs and that surrender to the same means the betrayal of Persia, and since the participation of the anarchist leaders in the Government of the democratic Moslem country of Persia is considered as a warning of danger to the inde pendence and integrity of Persia, we hereby declare an alarm so that the peoples of the world may understand that more than 1 million men and women of the Resistance Movement of the South with the co-operation of the movements of the west and south-west and other parts of the country with their life in their hands and rifles on their shoulders, will begin open resistance. This proclamation which has been made on the mountains and deserts is considered as the last proclamation of the Resistance Movement of the South to the Government and the democratic Governments of the world. We want the mistake to be redeemed, otherwise they will have to be eye-witnesses of the bloody fighting and the vengeances of the Moslem patriotic people of Persia who are the basis of this movement. “ Peace be on those who follow the guidance of the Resistance Movement of the South.” 1,680 been asph following ¥ Mala&gt; Isfah; In ad Ti600 kiloi come fron vehicles w cost of pe The i to Banda 1937.

Roads have been divided into three main categories :—■ National Roads, which are those starting from the capital and chiefly or terminating at ports or at the frontiers of neighbouring countries. vessels a Provincial (Ustan) Roads, which are those joining one province to are oblig another. these pla Town (Shahristan) Roads, which are those connecting cities together. Rep Asphalting is to be done on roads according to their importance.1,680 kilom. of roads in the south and west of the country have already been asphalted and during the next five years it is intended to asphalt the following 3,560 kilom. :— Karaj-Qazvin; Tehran-Qum; Kuhin-Resht; Qum-Sultanabad- Malayer; Takestan-Zenjan-Tabriz; Tehran-Shahrud-Meshed; Qum- Isfahan-Bushire; Kashan-Murcheh Khur; Isfahan-Azna-Chalan Chulan. In addition, it is hoped to complete 6,500 kilom. of road and to open up some jT 600 kilom. of new roads. The necessary funds to meet the costs incurred will come from a yearly credit and also from a suggested special tax on transport vehicles which will be collected as a road tax on asphalted roads or added to the cost of petrol. B.— Railways. The main line from Tehran to Bandar Shah in the north and from Tehran to Bandar Shahpur in the south, a distance of 1,395 kilom., was completed in 1937. In the same year three branch lines were started, i.e., Tehran to Tabriz, Garmsar to Meshed and Qum to Yezd. These three lines are half-finished and their completion is given first priority in the list of railway construction to be carried out in the next five years. The work to be done is, briefly, as follows :— (a) Tehran to Tabriz. This line is completed up to Mianeh, a distance of 439 kilom. On the remaining 305 kilom. work has already started. (b) Garmsar to Meshed. This line is 811 kilom. in length, 313 kilom. of which are already in operation to Shahrud. A certain amount of work has been done on the remaining 498 kilom. (c) Qum to Yezd. This line is 475 kilom. in length and the track at present is almost complete as far as Yezd. After completion of the above three lines, the following lines are to be considered :— (i) Andimeshk to the Iraqi frontier, to join up with the line Kut-ul- Amarah-Bagdad, which is expected to be built by the Iraq Govern ment. The distance is approximately 90 kilom. (ii) Tabriz to Qutur (Turkish frontier), about 180 kilom. (iii) Yezd to Kerman and Zahidan, to join the Indian railway system, a distance of about 900 kilom. (iv) Meshed to Darjaz to join the Turkestan and Siberian Railways, about 250 kilom. (v) Kashan to Isfahan, approximately 185 kilom. C.— Ports. The most important ports through which the greater part of exports and imports have passed before and during the war are :— (a) Bandar Shahpur in the south. (b) Khurramshahr in the south. (c) Bandar Pahlevi on the Caspian. (rf) Bandar Shah on the Caspian. (e) Nowshahr on the Caspian. There are several other much smaller and less important ports situated chiefly on the Gulf coast. The water at these places is too shallow to admit cargo vessels, all loading and unloading being carried out by means of lighters, which are obliged to go out some distance to the anchorage. No work is to be done at these places. Repairs and constructions for the principal ports are detailed as follows :—6 (a) Bandar Shahpur. This port is very favourably situated at the southern terminus of the Trans- Iranian Railway. It is given precedence over Khurramshahr owing to the much greater expense incurred in the exploitation and maintenance of the latter port. Construction of the port is now complete and what work there is to be done is solely of a repair nature. (b) Khurramshahr. 0) It would appear, owing to the disadvantage mentioned above, that no arrangements for modifications or repairs have been made in the Five-Year Plan. (c) Bandar Pahlevi. This is the most import port in the north with a naturally good situation. Owing to the fall in the sea level of the Caspian, renovations are planned for the breakwaters and jetties, of which one or two new ones will have to be built. Two new lighthouses are to be constructed and the present ones repaired, together with several houses for the port personnel. (d) Bandar Shah. This port is situated at the northern terminus of the Trans-Iranian Railway. It requires extensive dredging every few years. A comprehensive programme of repair and reconstruction is prepared, including the purchase of lighthouses, a lightship, two diesel tug boats, a 7-ton floating crane and two other cranes, a fire-fighting ship and a motor boat. Construction work includes the extension of the embankment of the port area and the building of new storage depots. (e) Nowshahr. This is a newly made port situated 210 kilom. from Tehran. Extensive repairs and dredging are needed and are to be included in the five-year pro gramme. Other items include the extension of the western breakwater, the installation of two lighthouses and the erection of storage depots. In general, two complete hydrographic sets for the northern and southern ports will be purchased in order that regular weather reports may be produced. Also two sets of complete diving equipment for under-water repairs, construction and salvage for both the northern and southern ports are to be bought, A scheme to train technical staff and engineers in Persia and abroad in port work will be set in motion under the new programme.£t(T THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. SECRET. September 17, 1946. Section 1. [E 9208/315/34] Copy 'No. 1 3 3 Military Attache s Intelligence Summary No. 35, Secret, for the Period the ‘Ind September to the %th September, 1946.— {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 361 of Wth September; Received Yith September.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE report of the fusion of the four parties mentioned in paragraph 4 of last Intelligence Summary appears to have been incorrect in one small detail, the term “ fusion ” having been used in place of “co-operation.” Confirmation of some degree of cohesion between the parties is afforded by the holding of a large meeting in Tehran on the 6th September, when 350 bedecked lorries paraded before Qawam-us-Saltaneh, among whose entourage were also found Ministers, the Azerbaijan delegation, and the leaders of the Tudeh, Iran and Iran Demo crat Parties. Yet another recruit to this unholy alliance (according to the Persian press quoting London radio retransmitting a Tabriz broadcast) would appear to have been secured in the shape of the Kurdish Democrats, who have telegraphed to the Prime Minister and to the Irani Democrat, Azerbaijan Demo crat, Iran, and Tudeh Parties expressing their desire to coalesce with them. 2. The deadlock in the negotiations between the Central Government and the Azerbaijan delegates continues. The Persian Prime Minister, in conversa tion with His Majesty’s Ambassador, and the Minister of War, in conversation with the British Military Attache, both stated that, while Dr. Javid and M. Shabistari were disposed to be co-operative, it was Pishaveri who prevented them from making any concessions. The future organisation of the Azerbaijan People’s army, the method of merging the “ Eida’is ” into the gendarmerie, and the reassumption of control by the Central Government over the province of Khamseh (Zenjan), are the main points at issue, though questions of finance are also proving difficult, the Azerbaijan Government being short of money and the Central Government being unwilling to continue to finance a provincial Government over which it has long ceased to exercise any control whatever. Internal Security. Khuzistan. 3. Major-General Kupal left Khuzistan for Tehran on the 1st September, and rumours are now being heard of the anticipated findings of the military tribunal. These are to the effect that the Military Governor of Abadan, Major Fateh, and the Chief of the Police, Colonel Leali, are to be made the scapegoats and will be charged with dereliction of duty on two points, firstly, that they failed to make proper dispositions to prevent riots, and, secondly, that they failed to recover looted property and to identify casualties. Major Fateh, who is further accused of peculation in respect of sums given to him by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company to defray the cost of evacuating a number of families, has already been relieved of his post (his arrest has been reported in the press). Leali is to return to Tehran. BakhtiarifFars. 4. Khusro Qashgai returned to Shiraz on the 3rd September after a very brief stay in Tehran. He appears to be most pleased with himself, and is telling extravagant stories of his talk with the Prime Minister, which can be boiled down to the fact that he has successfully ingratiated himself with Qawam once more. The news of the proposed tribal revolt (see paragraph 7 of last Intelligence Summary) has become common knowledge in Isfahan. Both Abul Qasim Khan and Jehanshah Khan had been summoned to Tehran, but, according to His Majesty’s Consul, only the former intended to come as it was not adjudged [82—4]2 expedient for both co-governors to be absent at the same time. There are reports of various arrests to be made, and His Majesty’s Consul considers that even if any attack on Isfahan were now to be made it would be most unlikely to succeed. According to the Jouimal de Tehran, of the 9th Septemeber, Muzaffar Firuz arrived in Isfahan on the 7th September and at once proceeded to arrest Jehanshah Khan, son of Morteza Quli Khan, the co-governor of Bakhtiari. and also his brother, Amir Bahman, on the grounds that they had been plotting against the State. The same paper adds that a motorised company of gendarmerie has been sent to Isfahan. Further details concerning these arrests and the situation w ^ in Isfahan are awaited from His Majesty’s Consul. Muzaffar Firuz flew to Isfahan in a chartered Russian plane. 5. Further attempts at tribal unity in the south are reported by His Majesty’s Consul in Shiraz, who gives news of an agreement concluded between the Qashgai, Dushmanziari, Boir Ahmadi and the “coastal union.” The tribes comprising this latter “ union ” have not yet been identified, but Fathullah Khan Hayat Daudi is one of the signatories. A zerbaijan. 6. The spasmodic resistance to the Democrats which has been offered by the Slhahsavan tribe of the Ardebil area has completely collapsed, and the Demo crats have re-established full control of the area. 7. The Russians are buying wheat from the new harvest through con tractors, in consequence of which the price of the commodity has doubled in the last month and a serious shortage in the towns is anticipated. 8. There are no further reports of Russian troop movements on the frontier. 9. On the 3rd September the first anniversary of the founding of the Azerbaijan Democrat Party was celebrated at Tabriz with parades and a recep tion, the latter being attended by Qazi Mohammed, the Kurdish leader. Khamseh (Zenjan). 10. A press report announces the arrival of two companies of gendarmerie at Qazvin from Tehran. These are said to be destined for Zenjan at a later date. Khorassan. 11. Famine conditions are reported from the Qainat area in the south-east of the province. They are causing anxiety but little is being done to ease the situation. Mokran. 12. Zabul is seriously short of water and the Nurab River is dry as far as 20 miles into Afghan territory. The shortage appears to be due to unusually hot weather. Persian Army. 13. The new transport specialist of the United States Advisory Mission to the Persian army has under consideration a plan for the re-equipment of the army with mechanical transport. He considers that most of the present vehicles, such as the jeep, are unnecessary and, owing to their construction, needlessly expensive in running and maintenance costs. Accordingly he has produced a programme of purchases to cover five years starting from the Persian year 1326 (1947-48). New vehicles are to be from the “ International ” range of post-war commercial models and will include all types from a general utility van to be used instead of jeeps and ambulances to 10-ton lorries to replace the present Bussing-Nag tank transporter. The major item is a 5-ton heavy duty lorry, of which 500 are to be ordered. Other items include 100 2-ton lorries and 50 lOTon. Initial purchases will cover the present army stocks of vehicles in the first two years 1326 and 1327 (1947-48 and 1948-49). During this period all vehicles at present in the possession of the army will be sold to onset budget expenditure. The total cost of the programme (after deduction of profits through sales) is estimated to be $1,966,000 or 62,912,000 rials (estimated at the current fixed rate of exchange and current market prices). This programme has been approved bv General Ridley but has not yet been presented to the Minister of War.Persian Navy. 14. Reference paragraph 17 of Intelligence Summary No. 33.

It is reported in the press that the Ahwaz-Khorramshahr extension of the Trans-Iranian Railway has been reopened for light traffic. Appointments. 19.

General Farajullah Aghevli (late Chief of the General Staff) to be Governor of the Sepah (Military) Bank.complete confidence of Firuz, and who has been appointed sole Governor of Bakhtiari, is reported to have been the recipient of a large number of rifles together with the requisite ammunition. 6. Meanwhile tne Qashgai appear to have kept themselves clear of suspicion. Khosro Khan evaded going to Isfahan and sent Mohammed Hussain Khan in his stead when summoned there by Firuz. 7. The final outcome of this demarche by Firuz is not yet clear, but for the moment the Bakhtiari part in the plot appears to be quashed. There are tales that the Qashgai intend to go ahead with their part of the scheme, and Firuz is reported to have taken the precautionary measure of warning Mohammed Hussain that he could send 40,000 Caucasians against the tribe, thus indicating a lack of belief in the good faith of the Qashgai, but as yet there is insufficient evidence by which to judge their real intentions. 8. Muzaffar Firuz and elements of the press have made much of the complicity of “ foreign elements ” in the plot. Beyond this there have been references to the visit of the ambassador to Isfahan to which, coinciding as it did with these events, sinister motives have been attributed, and there has been a general assumption that the British were directly involved. 9. Firuz, on his return, told the United States Ambassador that he had “ documentary proof ” that His Majesty’s Government had engineered the plot and went on to say that the evidence secured in Isfahan was of such a nature that the Persian Government were considering an appeal to the Security Council. Kermanshah. 10. The Governor-General has been making himself unpleasant to repre sentatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and efforts of the company to start a Workers’ Welfare Society inside the compound has met with early opposition.

From a directory of Tehran newspapers compiled by the Press Counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassv the following facts are taken. Out of a total of 301 newspapers registered, 100 are not being published and 23 Right wing and 6 others have been suppressed. Of the 172 still appearing 4 are styled Right 9 moderate Right. 25 moderate Left and 37 Left. It is interesting to note that of this total only eight have a circulation of over 2,000. Even so, for a city of a total population of 750.000, out of which at least 50 per cent, are illiterate. 301 newspapers would seem to be an unusually high number.Appendix “A.” Although in several of my communiques I have forbidden any insulting behaviour towards officers of the Persian army and have stated that any insult to them will be considered as an insult to the State, I learn that, contrary to my orders and my wishes, a lack of respect has been displayed towards an officer of the army. ' ^ While regretting this incident I have issued an order for the officer to handed over to the military judiciary to be tried according to established law. I repeat once more that army officers must be respected in all places and by all people. It goes without saying that anyone disobeying this order will be the subject of investigation and will be severely punished.,4, T -»pi RLE COPY £XT 4 8^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

Military Attache's Intelligence 'Summary No. 37, Secret, for the Period MSth September to ^Ind September, 1946.— {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 389 of 25th September; Received 2nd October.) Political. Persian Affairs. NO further progress has been made in the conversations between the Central Government and the Azerbaijan Delegation, and it appears that an impasse has been reached. The Minister for War has stated that, on the one hand, the delegation has been presenting impossible demands for armaments and money to the Central Government, and, on the other, is seeking to impose its will on that Government so as to achieve the production of an agreement which will be sufficiently vague to satisfy the Prime Minister that he can carry out the elections and yet, thereinafter, leave Azerbaijan free to pursue its object of complete autonomy and of the further dissemination of Communist influence throughout the country. Their efforts are being resisted. 2. Closely connected to these discussions are those of Zenjan. During the week the press has been publishing reports to the effect that the Central Govern ment gendarmerie had moved up to Zen j an from Qazvin and that an agreement had been reached which comprised the following terms :— {a) That the Government accepted responsibility for disarming the tribes of the Northern Khamseh (Zen j an) area, especially the Zulfagharis. {b) That Tabriz recognised the right of the Central Government to eontn Zenjan and would, accordingly, evacuate their forces from the area. {c) That the gendarmerie of Zenjan would consist of two companies from the Central Government and two companies of locally recruited “ Fidais,” while command would be exercised by officers selected by Tehran. However, Sunday’s papers announce that the force has not yet left Qazvin and that new difficulties have arisen in the discussions. This is confirmed by the Minister for War, who states that a delegate visited Zenjan from Tabriz with specific instructions that the talks there must be kept going until a settlement is arrived at in Tehran. 3. Consequent on the allegations made by Muzaffar Firuz of the complicity of British officials and, in particular, of the Consul-General at Ahwaz in the Bakhtiari plot of revolt, His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador visited the Prime Minister and later Firuz to protest against the attitude of the Persian Government and to request to see the proofs supporting the accusation. The Prime Minister was seriously embarrassed; but Firuz maintained his original assertion, even though the only documentary evidence he could produce was a letter of introduction from the Governor of Burujird introducing Mr. Trott to Abul Qasim and a second from the editor of a provincial newspaper warning Abul Qasim of his impending arrival. He stated that a great mass of evidence would come up at the trial, but could not be produced before it. It appears that the Bakhtiari leaders may have tried to minimise their guilt by laying the blame on Mr. Trott, and that Firuz expects the ambassador to fall in with this solution and, maJking Mr. Trott the scapegoat, to remove him from the country. 4. Firuz, meanwhile, is further embarrassed by the necessity for the pro duction of evidence for the army. The Minister for War states that he has asked Firuz for it so that the military authorities may proceed with the enquiry into Colonel Hejazi’s behaviour. Firuz has so far managed to evade producing it. The Minister for War said that he was sure that, as soon as he did, Hejazi would be cleared and he himself would be able “ to attack ” and demand an enquiry into Firuz’s actions. 5. Firuz, stung by the Prime Minister’s allusions to lack of respect to army officers (published as an appendix to last week’s Intelligence Summary), published a reply to the effect that, contrary to the belief entertained in certain quarters, the Prime Minister was not making an indirect reference to the arrest of Colonel Hejazi. s ' ' Copy No. 1 3 rj [82—58]Internal Security. Ears. 6. The rumours of the intention of the Qashgai to go ahead with their plan of revolt irrespective of the fate of the Bakhtiari (see last week’s Intelligence Summary, paragraph 7) have been proved correct by the events of the week. Reza Hikmat (Governor-General of Kerman) arrived in Shiraz early in the week on an official mission to the tribe from the Central Government and immediately visited Naser Khan. Khusro Khan said that he had brought assurances from^i the Prime Minister that he would do whatever they wanted, and added that Hikmat was a genuine supporter of the tribe. Hikmat later visited Naser again accompanied by the Governor-General. Meanwhile, reports became current of Qashgai tribesmen assembling in the hills and raiding on the Bushire-Shiraz road. A deputation later went out from the town to visit Naser Khan and assure him of their collaboration provided he promised immunity in return. Alter this events moved swiftly. Naser Khan is reported to have presented the following demands with an ultimatum expiring on the 21st to the Government:— {a) Release of the arrested Bakhtiari leaders. (6) Removal of Government officials from Ears. (c) Dismissal of Tudeh Party Ministers from the Cabinet. (d) Arrest of Tudeh Party leaders in Ears. Action followed quickly on these steps and by Saturday army reports indicated that all small gendarmerie posts south of Shiraz had been disarmed and that the garrisons at Kazerun, Ardekan, Khormuj and Bushire were surrounded by tribesmen. The General Staff say that they are sending a relief column from Tehran on the 22nd, morning. (For further details see “ Army ' paragraphs.) All traffic on the Shiraz-Bushire road has ceased and telegraphic communications with Bushire and the rest of the country have been cut. One interesting point about the above is that the surrounding of Bushire implies that the tribes of the littoral have risen in support of the Qashgai. 7. A summary of the events leading up to the present situation provided by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, is attached at Appendix “ A.” 8. It is stated that the Governor-General of Ears and Reza Hikmat are due to arrive in Tehran on the 23rd. 9. The Minister for War appears perplexed about the method of handling the situation. On the one side he sees in the Qashgai a weapon to use in the defeat of the Tudeh, and, therefore, desires to placate them : on the other, he fears the possibility that the Russians may have a hand in the affair, that this is the second stage of the dismemberment of Persia, and that, in consequence, it is necessary to crush it mercilessly and speedily. Khorassan. 10. Ten to twelve thousand people are reported to have emigrated from Qainat, which is in the grip of famine, to Khoras&amp;m, and, although wheat has been promised from Khorassan, nothing has been sent as yet. In addition, it is reported, sheep, cattle and other animals, including plough ones, have’ been moved up to Khorassan, where they are being bought by the Russians for export. In consequence it is feared that there may be a shortage of stock for breeding purposes and that the sovying of next year’s crop will be seriously affected by the shortage of plough animals. 11. His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General in his report for August refers to the continuance of Russian activity in the area. After the ban on visits by Persians to foreign representatives, visitors to their consulate, although decreasing considerably in number, did not cease. Moreover, contacts are main tained through other means, such as the Cultural Society (VOKS), the Trade Agency Intourist, and the air service and hospital. Branches of cultural societies were opened during the month at Meshed and Sabzawar and meetings are regu larly and well attended by both official and non-official Persians. In contrast to this, although English language classes have been well attended, the consulate- general has received only three visitors from the date of the ban and former friends seem to be living in an atmosphere of fear. Khuzistan. 12. From the monthly report of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General it appears that during August the activities of the Soviet'Consul in Ahwaz and his associates had been little diminished. He is reported to have gone to Abadan on the 11th and visited an official of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and aoain to Khorramshahr on the 11th; furthermore his associates have more than once been over to Basra on various pretexts. Beyond this he has made no secret° •fV, 1S Q 1 u 1 ^ 1 u S V n ^■ ra ^ )s ari( i ^ ias certainly nacie attempts to ge into contact ^ Chassib Khaz’al and other Arab ( personal it the} Persian side o the bhatt-el-Arab.

Ihe General Staff find themselves considerably embarrassed at the constant demands on tneir reserves. With many units already out from the capital in Khuzistan, Kurdistan, Qazvin, Giian and Gurgan, they are now called upon to meet the emergency in Pars. The divisions of the capital appear to be strengthened by the induction of a very large percentage of recruits, who now have three to four months' training; nor are these up to the usual standard in that the necessity of reconstituting the lost 3rd (Azerbaijan) Division and of providing units to form a basis for the new 11th (Giian) and 12th (Gurgan) Divisions has meant the calling up of conscripts dowm to the age of 17 years, whereas the usual age is 21. 14. However, the General Staff were able to send a battalion to Isfahan last week and this week-end are preparing a regiment numbering (according to the Chief of the General Staff) about 2,000. 15. In spite of this he appears reasonably cheerful about the future and says that, giving the requisite international background situation, he can, w T hen called upon to do so, reoccupy Azerbaijan and bring it under control with the use of only two regiments. 16. Sarlashgar Zahedi, Inspector to the 6th and 9th Divisions in the Ministry of War, has been sent down to Pars and assumes control of the opera tions of those divisions. This, so the Minister of War states, is normal practice. 17. Sarhang Ghulam Reza Saqafi arrived in Khuzistan and assumed command of the division on the 18th September. 18. The units of the 1st (Tehran) Division completed their training at Lashgarak Camp on the 18th, with final manoeuvres before the Shah. The camp is now closed down for the winter. 19. The divisional commander of the 10th (Khuzistan) Division has written to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company asking for barracks to be built for permanent garrisons of 300 men at Masjid-i-Sulaiman and Agha Jari and for 120 men at Haft Kel. The company have agreed to do it. 20. The combatant units available in the south to meet the threat of the Qashgai and littoral tribes consist of three infantry regiments, one cavalry regi ment and four batteries of artillery. The 10th (Hamleh) Cavalry Regiment from Tehran, which was down in Pars earlier in the year, has been disbanded for lack of horses. If faced with a general rising throughout Pars these forces, scattered as they are over widely-scattered lines of communication from Abadeh in the north-west to Darab in the south-east and Bush ire in the south, would probably be tied to the ground and incapable of taking effective offensive action against the tribes. Instead, they would be hard put to it to maintain their garrisons, many of which are only of a company strength : these, if invested for any considerable period of time, would probably have to surrender for lack of supplies. The garrison at Bushire, for example, reported on the 21st that it had supplies sufficient for twenty days. The garrisons actually surrounded at the date of writing are as below :— (a) At Bushire : One battalion less one company. (5) At Kazerun : Brigade headquarters, one battalion and two companies. (c) At Khormuj : One company. (d) At Ardekan : One company. The garrison of one company of Borazjan is reported to have withdrawn to Kazerun. 21. The Chief of the General Staff has stated that the army finds itself with insufficient funds in hand from the budget allotment of the current year to meet in toto the requested prepayment for the arms ordered from Great Britain (see Intelligence Summary No. 28 dated 21st July, paragraph 13). In consequence he has requested that they be permitted to make an immediate payment of 50 per cent.' of the sum involved and a payment of the balance after the opening of the next financial vear {i.e., after the 22nd March, 1947). His request has been referred to the War Office.4 v Appointments. Civil. 22. Mohammed Qawam to be Director-General of the Prime Minister's office.

Appendix “ A.” 1HE first step towards obtaining autonomy for Pars was made by local Democrat Party which telegraphed to the Prime Minister last spring asking that i^ars should be given the same measure of autonomy as Azerbaijan. The nme Minister did not reply. The Democrat Party in question has no connexion with the other parties in Persia calling themselves Democrats. It was originallv tormed at the instigation of Wassmuss during the 1914-18 war in order to rurther German designs in Persia and was pro-German and anti-British. The party was revived in 1944 as a local Conservative party that had discarded its former anti-British orientation. 2. The next step was taken by tribes of the littoral of the Persian Gulf who made a pact to settle their disputes amicably in assembly by majority vote and to work together for the good of the country. . ^ 3. Signatories of this pact wished to extend its scope to cover leading tribal and political groups in Pars and so first invited the Qashgai, which is the^largest tubal confederation in Pars, to subscribe to it. -jfhe Qashgai, who, when this approach was made to them, considered the f/'T 6 , , m r, St&lt; ; r S u e Y P arty as the best defence a g ainst growing encroachment ot ludeh Party, had just announced their adherence to the Prime Minister's party, and so the attempt to include them in the pact made on the littoral was unsuccessiui. 5 When, however, the names of the Central Committee of the Prime Minister s party were announced and it was seen that Tudeh supporters were amongst them the Qashgai changed their mind about the effectiveness of the Prime of’the littoi al ^ f ° r reS1Stlng the Tudeh Party and decided t0 ad here to the pact 6. Within a very short time the Mamassani-Doshmanziari tribes had ioined and a working arrangement had been made with the Khamseh tribes. Their present action has been precipitated by the recent reshuffle of the Cabinet In inc ude three members of the Tudeh Party and by steps immediately taken by the srsais?. *»-*'• in »*» “ d * ^»«. .

Political. THERE have been no events of importance in the capital. A cloak of silence covers the deadlock in the Azerbaijan talks, while all attention is directed towards the progress of events in Ears. Pars. Internal Security. 2. Events in Ears during the past week fall into twx) categories, that of military operations and that of political negotiations,. 3. In the first category detailed news is not available in that communications are bad. However the main fact emerges that the garrisons of the 6th Division have so far stood their ground and that the relief column despatched from Tehran has been halted at Abadeh pending the outcome of political negotiations. Although skirmishing is reported from Ardekan, fighting has so far been confined to Kazerun and Busnire. At the former town the tribes are reported to have launched two attacks which the military have repulsed without difficulty. At Bushire the tribes, apparently under the leadership of Hayat Daud, have invested the town at the north end of the peninsular and confined the Government forces to their barracks at the south end; inconclusive skirmishing is in progress. The Divisional Headquarters have been maintaining contact with their isolated forces by aerial reconnaissance. Shiraz remains unmolested by tribal forces. His Majesty’s Consul reports the surrender of Government forces in Bushire on the evening of the 28th. No reason for this is yet known, but the cause was probably shortage of water. Aerial machine-gunning and bombing of the tribes nas been started on a light scale. The house of the British consulate doctor has been looted. British subjects are being concentrated in the Residency, Cables and Wireless offices and consulate, all of which are clearly visible from the air and remote from military targets. 4. In the political sphere, Reza Hikmat and the Governor-General of Ears arrived in Tehran at the beginning of the week. Negotiations were subsequently initiated by radio talks between the Prime Minister and Naser Khan. These produced no result and a commission was despatched from the capital to continue negotiations. This consisted of Ezaz Nikpay, Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister, Reza Hikmat, General Saffari, Chief of Police, and Javad Bushiri, ex-Majlis Deputy. 5. Prior to the arrival of this commission Naser Khan had despatched a sweeping nine-point demand to the Government demanding such steps as the dissolution of the Cabinet. After meetings with Naser, the Government Commis sion has telegraphed to Tehran a modified demand comprising the following five points :— (a) The institution of general and area counchls in Ears. (b) The addition of two Ministers without portfolio to the existing Cabinet. (c) The withdrawal and replacement of the present military commander in Ears. (d) The control of the gendarmerie to come under Mohammed Hussein Khan Qashgai. (^) The appointment of Government officials only with the prior approval of the people of the province. The most noteworthy point of these latest demands is the complete abandonment of reference to the removal of the Jndeh fronrthe Government and from Ears [82—66] ygy ggS6. In a fulsome and wordy telegram Qawam-us-Saltaneh has replied accepting demands (a), (c) and, “providing it does not upset the carrying out of Government plans,” (e). Demands (b) and (d) he has rejected. The telegram is concluded with a warning that, if the Qashgai continue to agitate, measures will be taken to disperse the tribal forces. 7. Communications continue to be in the hands of the Qashgai and Anglo- Iranian Oil Company tankers have been stopped en route to Shiraz coming bot^H^ from the direction of Bushire and that of Isfahan. On the.intervention of tmr British Consul some of the latter have been allowed through. Isfahan. 8. The British Consul reports that martial law, which was imposed at the time of the arrests of the Bakhtiari leaders, is working well and is welcomed by all except the Tudeh and the Russians. The town is quiet except for sporadic attempts on the part of the former 'to undermine the military control. The majority of the Bakhtiari tribes have now moved to their winter qua iters in the south. 9. The counsellor of the Russian Embassy arrived in the town on the 15th September, and one of his chief objects appeared to be to ascertain if the imposition of martial law was genuine or a put up job by the Government. Khuzistan. 10. During the week the military garrisons, except that of Masjid-i- SuLaiman, which were guarding the various oil-field areas, were withdrawn to their respective centres. The Chief of the General Staff said that this was a move of reorganisation, and that the alarm of the oil company at the way in which their employees were thus left unprotected was unjustified in that the military had been replaced by gendarmerie. So far there is no indication that the Ears revolt will spread to Khuzistan; on the contrary, there is the superficial reassurance of the declaration of the tribes round Behbehan that they are loyal to the Central Government. 11. In the Arab areas the Governor-General is growing agitated at the increasing restlessness of the Arab tribes and considers that he will have to arrest various sheikhs if he is to prevent a flare-up between their followers and the Tudeh. However, he hesitates to do so for he fears the loss consequent on such an action of supporters in his efforts to keep the Tudeh in hand. He is using Sheikh Chassib as an agent to persuade various sheikhs of the Abadan and Khorramshahr areas to come to Ahwaz. His suasions are backed by threat of arrest at the hands of the military if they do not do so. As he has already arrested Sheikh Sayid Baqir Nazzari, although he released him three days later against a promise that he would not return to Khorramshahr, the Arabs have little grounds for confidence. In fact they regard Chassib as a traitor and two sheikhs have stated to the British Consul-General in Basra that they have no confidence in the Central Government and intend to resist. They said that they passed this information on in case the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company installations should become involved. 12. The other threat to security, the Tudeh Party continues to present a tranquil surface and to hold small meetings in secret. A few days ago they sent a telegram to their headquarters in Tehran saying that they could endure the “ oppression ” of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company officials no longer and asking for instructions : to this they received a reply that they should do nothing for the present. Meanwhile, the fourth anniversary celebrations of the party are due to commence on the 1st October and the iVnglo-Iranian Oil Company are appre hensive of developments. ' 13. The triple threat to the security of British lives and property repre sented by the circumstances recounted above has been brought to the attention of the Chief of the General Staff. He has replied that there was no undue cause for concern and that, so far as the Tudeh were concerned there would be no relaxation of military law during the period of their celebrations. He further said he would send a signal to the Divisional Commander to order him to consult with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company manager in Ahwaz to ensure that the interests of the company were fully protected. Kermanshah. 14. Abbas Qubadian, Amir-i-Makhsus, has expressed the hope of starting action similar to that of the Qashgai and said that, when he formed a union of3 area May last, he had been in touch with the Qashgai and u t i /}: j e v ^ ent on to say that he did not want to do anything subversive, i.i . ,, e u ^ &gt;r ^ me Minister was selling the country to the Russians and rv™ u e j T 1 )esmen ’ w ^° were very restless, would have to take matters into their own hands. ^ Press has continued to attack the oil company and also has r 3 ? 1 ar ^ lcXe attacking the British Ambassador for his alleged connexion with the Isfahan events. Khorassan. su S a i‘ factory at Meshed was burnt down on the night of the rd September. This event, occurring just when the beet crop was ready, will no only cause a loss of hbout 6,000 tons of sugar to the Government, but will a so cause serious loss to cultivators and create considerable unemployment. A zerbaijan. fk M le anse *M e d conditions prevailing in the province have necessitated i a k oc ^ es °f “ Fidais ” to Shahpur and Khoi against the Kurds, ° riA/r • ^ 3 u ^ s ^ ara against irregular forces operating there, and to Zen j an and Mianduab to counter possible encroachment by Government forces. In con sequence of all these demands Tabriz is entirely divested of its forces of Fidais. 18. It appears that Qazi Mohammed’s Kurds have brok*en their uneasy alliance with the Azerbaijan Democrats. Uniformed bahds have occupied Rezaieh, have surrounded a village eight miles to the north, and have cdhtrol of the road running from that town to Shahpur. 19. There is increasing impatience at the failure of the Azerbaijan delega tion to achieve results in its talks with the Central Government, and Pishevari has attacked reactionary elements in the Government for deliberately delaying negotiations. 20. Owing to its acute financial embarrassment the Provincial Government is making heavy and immediate demands in respect of earlier “ under-assess ment ” for taxes. Failure to meet these demands is resulting in imprisonment and sequestration of property. 21. Another step of some severity is the publication of an order to land lords and peasants to hand grain in amounts, and at prices, fixed by the Govern ment. Failure to do so is punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment with hard labour. Kerman. 22. The Divisional Commander has gone to Sirjan to initiate operations against the tribes of that area, notably the Buchakchis, who have been growing increasingly restless. Military reinforcements have also been sent down and the press reports an engagement in the area. 23. The Divisional Commander further contemplates disarmament opera tions against Baluchi tribesmen which he hopes to start on the 23rd October. He asserts that the scheme as a whole is one of settlement and improvement of the conditions of the Baluchi Sirdars in order to bring them more under control and to prevent them being infected with communism. He has one million rials to further the schemes for improvements but expects difficulties as he has approached the British Consul at Kerman to get the co-operation of the Indian authorities to prevent the flight of tribesmen across the frontier.

SECRET. MILITARY ATTACHED INTELLIGENCE SUIvD'.ARY No. 59 FOR THE PERIOD 30TH SEPTElVlBER TO 6 TH OCTOBER 1946. PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Folltleal. 1 , Evidence has become available of a desire in military circles, presumably supported by right-wing elements, to overthrov/ the present government by a coup d^tat. The first approach was made on tho 21st September by tho Minister for War through tho Assistant Military Attache to tho Ambassador for advice as to how ho was to handle tho Qashgai situation so as to gain tho maximum advantage for His Majosty T s Government and for tho Persian Government, This matter was referred to London. On 3rd October tho Minister for War returned to tho charge expressing extreme regret at tho failure by tho Embassy to supply him with a M plan ,, , Prom this ho wont on to suggest a complete change of Government either by engineering a coup d r 6 tat through tho Palace or by forcing Qawam-us-Saltbnoh to re-constituto his Government, In both cases, ho wont on to say, the influence of tho British Ambassador would be necessary to persuade cither tho Shah or Qawam to take tho requisite stops, and tho partios concerned would need assurance of future British and American support in consequent difficulties with Russia. A similar approach had boon made a few days previously by General Razmara through an intermediary. Shortly afterwards a report reached CX sources that General Razmara had stated that His Majesty's Government“had promised full support, financial and otherwise, for some auah scheme and that this plot had boon onginoorod by tho Assistant Military Attache', tho Minister for War and General Razmara's intermediary. On the 6 th October CX sources reported that'a direct approach had bo^n made to them for support for this scheme, originating this time not from tho Chief of tho General Staff but from tho Minister for War. It appears that military circles are really deeply interested in ouch a project, but that tho approach is complicated by rivalry and distrust between tho Minister for War and tho Chief of tho General Staff. This latter supposition is confirmed by a query made in tho last approach as to which of tho two His Majesty's Government would support. At tho same time tho Prime Minister appears to bo considering some change in his policy. He has told tho United States Ambassador of his intention to initiate a radical change of policy which would'bo loss conciliatory to tho Azerbaijani and other left-wing elements, but only provided ho was assured in advance of adequate financial and economic support from tho United States. Ho also said that ho had now decided to attend tho forthcoming mooting of the General Assembly of tho United Nations. In this connoction another rumour is also currant that ho intends to bring up once more Persia's case beforo tho Security Council. /2» In a2, In q mooting with tho!

Tho Rrimo Mi^stor expressed roadinoos to oxamino tho ease in tho light of Mr. rrott r s roport and in viow of His Majesty’s Government’s assurance of tho non^complicity of Mr, Trott. He also appeared oxtromoly intorostod In His Majesty’s Government’s suggestion of an official disclaimer to make it clear that bho Qashgai and other rebels could hope for no assistance from tho British. /f ound 3. Tho Shah signed on the 5th October the royal * proclamation to authorise the holding of tho next Parliamentary elections. According to a Court official, hitherto/roliablo, tho Persian Prime Minister told tho Shah that tho Russian Ambassador had informed him that his Government could not accept any more lame excuses for delay and that in consequence, ’ ho was powerless to refuse tho Russian Ambassador’s ' demand and that. If tho Shah wore to refuse to sign tho proclamation, the Soviet Ambassador would know that it was tho Shah and not the Persian Government who was obstructing them. How tho Persian Government can hold elections with tho country in its present state it is difficult to soo. Tho provinces of Azerbaijan and Khans oh aro under comploto Democrat control, Gllan, Mazanderan and Gurgan are virtually run by tho Tudoh. Kurdistan is under Kurdish control. Pars is a battlefield and Hermanshah likely to become one® 4 # Reports, which are not confirmed from official sour cos, are current to tho effect that Russia has asked Persia to repudiate tho Sa’adabad Pact and that M.

Tho garrison appears to have ' acquitted Itself well up to tho end lor they wore heavily outnumbered a gathering estimated at 5,000 tribesmen having boon resisted by a force of 600/700 military. The Chief of the General Staff states that tho force only surrendered after their ammunition had boon exhausted, and this is confirmed by the Consul at Shiraz who states that 2,000 rifles and 3 machine-guns wore captured but (for the tribesmen) disappointingly little ammunition. He also reports that tho garrison hoisted a white flag in token of surrender and then machine-gunned i N / thoar^dcs orting to thon wit: _4_6 t' oir rifles .3 area, to^, the writ ” Goner a l' Danoshian, Rozaioh. appears to the United States Shahs a van In th of the local Government dooa not appear to run. who has boon in touch with tho Soviet Consul at be tho solo authority and recently refused passage to tno Vice-Consul oven though he had a pass issued by the Frovineial^Covernnont Finally to complete a scene of confusion, there are rumours of ris inns*starting again in Eastern Azerbaijan; and tho Minister for War has * said that the recently-established military garrison at Rosht are providing the tribe with arms and ammunition. mi Kliorassan. 12 . mo fire at the Meshed sugar factory, which was reported last week, docs not now appear to have bean as serious as was at first thought * Tho Government Inspector has reported that ho can repair tho damage within 5 weeks anc thereby save tho sugar-boot crop- which Fas been'especially good this year and should yield 12 to 14 thousand tons, i.o. about trie tho normal output.

When seen by the British Military Attache on 12th October, he seemed to be musing on the mutability of the minds of Princes and the waywardness of tribal chieftains but derived some solace from the British Military Attache's assurance that not only he but the British and Germans in two world wars had come to the conclusion that money spent on the Qashgai was not a sound investment. 2. Under instructions from His Majesty’s Ambassador the British Military Attache tackled the Chief of the General Staff, without disclosing the source of the information, on the statements attributed to him in paragraph 1 of la-st Intelligence Summary concerning the connection of the assistant military attache with the Minister of War in a plot to overthrow the present regime. The Chief of the General Staff denied that he had ever said such a thing, assured the British Military Attache that his assistant's behaviour had been most correct, that his two visits had been made solely to ask for official information about the events in Ears and that the political implications of the revolt had not been discussed. 3. In paragraph 3 of last Intelligence Summary the opinion was expressed that the Persian Government would find it almost impossible to hold elections with the country in its present state. It was meant to imply, of course, that free elections could not be held. That Qawam-us-Saltaneh intends to go ahead with the elections there is no doubt. He will keep behind the bars all the prominent Rightist politicians now under arrest and continue to suppress the newspapers which supported them. This will stifle effectually any opposition from that quarter. It appears, however, on good authority, that he intends to go further than that and in order to prevent possible disorders arising out of rivalry between the Tudeh Party and his own Iran Democrat Party he has proposed a fusion of those two under the banner of “a common front against reaction.' His henchman, Muzaffar Firuz, has stated that Government will be content with 60 per cent, of the seats in the new Majlis. Qawam fails to realise that many of the members of his party are also members of the Tudeh and it will not be difficult to foresee where their allegiance will lie after they have secured election, whether on the Tudeh or Democrat ticket. He also fails to realise that, in the last Majlis, a disciplined Tudeh minority of eight successfully imposed their will on a disunited majority of 128 and that, with increased representation in the next Majlis and a working understanding with the Iran Democrats, the Govern ment of Persia will be under effective Communist control. The Royal Proclama tion announcing the forthcoming elections has cast the deepest gloom over the whole country, and it now seems evident to all patriotic Persians that Qawam- us-Saltaneh has definitely sold his country to the Russians. The inactivity of His Majesty’s Government in the face of all this is to them incomprehensible. Non-intervention they could understand and appreciate provided it was practised by the Russians as well, but to stand aside and leave your adversary a free hand can only mean to them one of three things : {a) that His Majesty’s Government is no longer interested in the fate of Persia or in the preservation of its integrity; (b) that His Majesty’s Government is so afraid of Russia that it dare not oppose her in Persia ; (c) that His Majesty’s Government and the Soviet Govern ment have come to a deal about Persia. The more intelligent admit that a [83—28] Bpolicy of non-intervention was both correct and fruitful in so far that it enabled His Majesty s Government to show up at U.N.O. with a clear conscience Russia's nefarious acts in North Persia, and in so far that, with strong American support, they succeeded in securing the evacuation of Persia by Russian troops. But, they argue, after Qawam's act of treachery in withdrawing Persia's case from U.N.O., and the beginning of his downhill career of subservience to Russia, hi A agreement to Russian demands and his failure to prevent Russian interference, in Persian affairs, to continue a policy of non-intervention was a cardinal error of policy on the part of His Majesty's Government. This is the widely-held opinion from the Shah downwards. That it has lost the British most of their friends and much of their influence and prestige is obvious, and the Persian, by now thoroughly alarmed at the rapid trend of events and the almost certain future fate of his country, is trying to make British flesh creep by predicting that the continuance of this policy of laissez faire will lose the British their oil in Khuzistan and their position in the Persian Gulf. 4. The Prime Minister has given up the idea of attending the United Nations Assembly. The retention of office is the thought uppermost in Qawarms mind and he has doubtless realised that to absent himself from Persia in the present disturbed state of the country and with the elections imminent would be unwise. His brave words to the American Ambassador about taking a tougher line with the Azerbaijanis or about taking offensive action to recover the province of Khamseh (Zenjan) have turned out to be moonshine. Internal Security A zerbaijan 5. The Azerbaijan delegation which left Tabriz on 21st August is still in Tehran and no agreement has yet been reached with the Central Government, Its main objects are to secure the appointment of local officials to the army and gendarmerie (the “Fidais' who are now reported to number 30,0001 the recognition of their locally-promoted “general” (deserters from the’Persian army) to press for general elections in Persia so as to consolidate their position as a Government representing the will of the people, and to secure the return of 15 million tomans owed by the National Bank. His Majesty’s Consul-General The delegation left labriz in no spirit of conciliation, nor were they imbued with an) will to negotiate. T heir object was to table demands which the Central Government must accept. Their continued stay in the capital and the absence of any hard news have given rise to the fear that the Prime Minister m hoodwinking them. Certainly the Democrats have enough to embarrass them Their financial position is desperate. Kurdish activities in Urumieh district are keeping them on tenterhooks, while forces of irregulars, equipped say the Democrats, by the Persian authorities in Resht, have been in conflict with the fidais in Ardebil. The provincial government scheme, for the collection of grain tor storage for winter needs, is meeting with resistance from landowners and laimeis alike, and tax defalcations keep the Government tills empty The Russians are buying up cattle, sheep, and wheat, cheerfully ignoring the official price control ; the scarcity of bread is becoming more acute, and the party has to contend with a populace of which 90 per cent, are either hostile or completely apathetic. Trade is stagnant, as people who have any money either hide if or transfer it to Tehran for security.” 6. Two leaders of the Allahlu section of the Shahsavan, Abdul Hussain Man sun and Hassain Agha \ atandust are at present in Tehran and it is under- stood that the object of their visit is to endeavour to get arms from the Chief of the General Staff to enable them to prosecute their struggle against the Demo crats. This struggle has been renewed and carried on for the past two months to the west of Ardobil. 1 he Allahlu claim remarkable success for themselves j a y„ that the y have accumulated about 1,200 rifles as a result of raids on 'Iidai garrisons. They say that they need another 600 rifles to make up a hghtmg force sufficiently strong to capture Ardobil itself. This they want to do betore the winter sets in so that they can establish a continuous line through Fastern Azerbaijan running down through the territory of other branches of the Shahsavan and of the Zuffaqaris to the Zonjan and Qazvin area. Approaches have been made before this both to the Chief of the General Staff and the Minister ol War. The result has been the establishment of a contact with the militaiv garrison at Rosht. Money, which is of little use, has been supplied bv the armv but as yet no arms. * ,r ’Fars 7. No serious fighting is reported from Far? since the events mentioned in paragraph 6 of last Intelligence Summary. A skirmish occurred near Jahrum and some banditry is reported on the Shiraz-Isfahan road on 10th October, for which Nasir Khan disclaims any responsibility. Some fighting is reported from .Niriz, where a column coming from Sirjan successfully occupied both that place 'and I as a. Though Fathullan Hayat Daudi, the conqueror of Bushiro, arrived in Sheraz to encourage the Qashgai to further efforts, Nasir Khan did not attack Shiraz, which was virtually an open town, as the Persian army were busy defending themselves and not Shiraz in their barracks about a mile distant. Some say that the Qashgai had suffered severely from the aerial bombing and machine-gunning by the Persian Air Force, and were inclined to take a profit, others say that Nasir's armies were melting away at the approach of autumn fearing the danger to their flocks in any further delay in the downward migra tion to their winter quarters. Whatever the reason was, General Zahodi arrived in Tehran on 8th October with Nasir Khen's proposed terms. The exact nature of these is not yet known but the Minister of War gave the British Military Attache the following brief outline :— (i) The Persian army to remain in Fars at their pre-revolt strength and locations, but to refrain from any punitive or offensive action. (ii) A general amnesty. (iii) Nasir Khan to hand back all heavy weapons and equipment taken from the Persian army immediately and the small arms within six months (many of those fell into the hands of the Boir Ahmedi, who joined in the fray in the hopes of looting both sides indiscriminately). (iv) The gendarmerie to remain in Fars at a strength of one regiment and to work under the general guidance of Nasir Khan. It is noteworthy that no mention of the Persian Gulf littoral is made but it is believeci that Nasir Khan considers that area to be within his “ sphere of influence.’’ 8. The Tudeh Party's printing press has been removed to the Russian Con sulate, whence its manifestos now issue. A prominent Tudeh member, Mutaqqi, is reported to be in hiding there. 9. The British women and children in Shiraz were due to leave for Bushire by road on 11th October as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company did not judge it safe to send an aeroplane to Shiraz. Khorasan 10. According to His Majesty's Consul-General in Meshed the Russian Frontier Commission at Sarakhs is spending large sums on Tudeh and Soviet propaganda among Persian frontier officials and Baluch tribal leaders. Khuzistan 11. Though the Hayat Daudis appear to be in control of the Persian Gulf coast as far north as Bandar Dilam, there have, as yet, been no dangerous reper cussions of the Fars revolt in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concessional area. Malik Mansur Basht Bavi disarmed some gendarmes at Gach Saran on the excuse that if he did not do so they would be in danger of being disarmed by the Boir Ahmedi. 12. The two infantry companies reported in last Intelligence Summary as having been sent to Gach Saran have again been withdrawn. Persian Army 13. Both the Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff have informed the British Military Attache that, unless the Prime Minister can produce evidence against Colonel Hejazi (see paragraph 1 of Intelligence Summary No. 36, and paragraph 4 of Intelligence Summary No. 37) they intend to set him at liberty. 14. The unfortunate General Arfa, the late Chief of the General Staff, remains in military custody and there seems to be no immediate prospect of his trial being commenced. It is interesting to note that both the Shah and General [83—28] . b 24 Razmara, the present Chief of the General Staff, admitted to the British Mili tary Attache to having supplied the Zulfiqaris and Shahsavans with Govern ment rifles and ammunition to aid them in their partisan activities against the Democrats of Azerbaijan—the very indictment which formed one of the charges against General Arfa. 15. The Persian army is, as always, short of money but flush with officers A. and the General Staff have had under consideration for some time a scheme for™ sending senior officers abroad to study various aspects of military training on the condition that they should continue to draw their Persian rates of pay only and receive no foreign travelling allowances. It is believed that the high cost of living in Persia and not professional keenness was the cause of the rush of officers to volunteer. General Johanbani is to head a mission to study military schools in Russia, Prance and Belgium. The Ministry of War have made parallel approaches to the British Military Attach^ and through their air attache in London for Brigadier Atapur, ex-Persian Military Attache in London, to proceed to the United Kingdom to study organisation and training. Permission has been asked, it is bdieved, for other parties of officers to visit the United States and France. Persian Navy ^ 16. The Ministry of War have decided, in view of the present insurrections in South Persia, to commission at least one of the three small gunboats Simurgh, Shahbaz and Shahrukh. Though they were handed back by the Royal Navy five months ago, the Ministry of War have only now brought to the notice of the British Military Attach^ the fact that the guns and machine-guns originally mounted in those ships have been replaced, while they were in use by the Royal Navy, by others of a different pattern and calibre. For those they hold no ammunition and have asked for assistance in obtaining a supply from British naval sources. 17.

The Persian Prime Minister broadcast a long speech on 27th October. The chief points were that elections must be held and intrigues to stop them defeated. Good relations with Russia must be strengthened, but it was to be hoped that the Soviet Government would put a stop to unfriendly broadcasts from Moscow. Mutual good will and friendship inspired Anglo-Iranian rela tions and it was important that all necessary steps should be taken to maintain law and order in the area of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s operations. At the same time it was to be hoped that in the interests of strengthening good relations between the two countries all British officials in Persia would carefully abstain from any interference in Persia’s internal affairs. With the United States the happiest relations had been established and America’s economic help was hoped for. All countries should understand, however, that the basis of good relations with Persia was scrupulous abstention from interference in Persia's internal affairs. Let no one try to bully Persia. Extensive internal reforms were intended including the elimination of political teaching from the schools and the expansion of educational facilities throughout the country, the continued application of a programme for the distribution of State lands to the peasantry while preserving the proper rights of private property together with energetic measures to improve the standard of living of the agricultural population and the proper regulation of relations between workmen and employers. The Prime Minister concluded with a repudiation of the Tudeh Party’s claim to be the only freedom-loving party in the country. 2. The Persian press, quoting a semi-official source, stated on 3rd November that the elections would begin after the tenth day of Moharram (Ashura) which falls on 5th December, 1946. 3. The Persian press announced on 3rd November that the Soviet-Persian agreement signed on 4th April, 1946, between Qawam-us-Saltaneh and M. Sadtchikof, the Soviet Ambassador, having expired on 24th October, 1946. had been renewed for a further period of three months (For the terms of this agree ment see paragraph 1 of Intelligence Summary No. 13 current.) The announce ment was based, it was said, on semi-official sources. On 4th November a Government communique published by the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda stated that the news was untrue. Finance 4. The Persian Government has applied for a loan of 250 million dollars from the International Bank. Internal Security Azerbaijan. 5. In paragraph 9 of last Intelligence Summary it was stated that the Azerbaijan People’s Army and the “ Fidais ' were being brought to a higher pitch of preparedness and His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz now reports that about 2,000 conscripts of the Azerbaijan People’s Army left Tabriz in the direction of Zenjan on 28th October and that southward movement from Tabriz continues. Two field guns accompanied the column. A local source, described by His Majesty’s Consul-General as “ moderately reliable,” reports the receipt of several field guns from the Russians. This latter piece of information T83—110]will require confirmation as it is possible that the source mistook for Russian fie guns the mountain guns captured from the Persian army garrisons in Azerbaijan who surrendered in the winter of 1945-46. The Persian army s losses dunng that period were estimated at eight x 75-mm. Bofors mountain guns. Kurdistan. 6. Some minor clashes have occurred in Kurdistan between the Kurds and the Persian military forces. The Minister for War is much perturbed at the request made to the Persian Prime Minister by the Azerbaijan Democrats for the evacuation of Sardasht by the Government forces and the handing over of that town to them. In an interview with the Minister of War on 2nd November the British Military Attache found him in much the same state as lago found his general. “ horribly stuffed with epithets of war.' He had, he said, explained to the Prime Minister the folly and danger of granting such a request. The evacua tion of Sardasht would render untenable the garrisons of Baneh and Saqqiz and, ultimately, Senneh, and would thus expose the whole Hamad an district to Democrat infiltration. It would cut off the Afshar and Zulfiqari partisans from support. It would bring the Democrats and their Russian advisers to within striking distance of the Iraqi border and the Kirkuk oil fields. Apart from these tactical considerations there were other equally weighty political reasons, added the Minister of War, for refusing the request for, if granted, it would breed a spirit of defeatism and mistrust of the politicians in the Persian army. The Minister of War is by no means sure that he has prevailed upon the Prime Minister to refuse this request. Bakhtiari. 7. There is no news from this area save that the Qashgai in Pars are reported to be very angry with Abul Qasim Bakhtiari for having made treacherous and premature disclosure of the plot hatched between them. Abul Qasim, for his part, is probably feeling very smug for, in the words of His Majesty’s Consul- General, Ahwaz, “ his surprising antics have resulted in (i) the removal of his co-Governor, Johanshah Khan, (ii) Murteza Quli Khan and many members of this rival family being arrested, (iii) the complete control of Bakhtiari passing into Abul Qasim's hands, (iv) his former friend, Hormuz Ahmedi being recalled from his governorate at Burujird to Tehran and being imprisoned, (v) his obtaining 1,000 rifles and much ammunition from the Persian Government, (vi) his inducing the Persian Government to request the recall of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ahwaz.” Fars 8. General Zahedi has informed His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz that the Shira.z- Bush ire road is still in the hands of the tribesmen but that traffic is running and complete security prevails. General Zahedi is being pressed by the Central Government to send garrisons to reoccupy Kazerun and Bushire but he is opposed to this as feeling against the army is still running high amongst the tribes and he fears a recrudesence of the recent trouble. Kuhgilu and Mamassani (see paragraph 8 of last Intelligence Summary). 9. His Majesty’s Consul-General Ahwaz reports that Malik Mansur Basht Bavi has handed back all the rifles he seized except a few which were taken by Husein Quli Rustam and which are expected back soon. Malik Mansur has visited the Governor-General at Ahwaz and was in a submissive mood. The Governor- General favours a plan of giving him some responsibility for maintaining law and order at Gach Saran while the G.O.C. is understood to be averse to this and would prefer to instal a military garrison there of about 300 strong. Khuzistan 10. Sheikh Abdullah, who has been residing in Koweit since he fled from Persia after instigating the disturbances of Khorramshahr early in 1946. has requested the permission of the British political authorities in Koweit to return to Persia. He claims that his elder brother Sheikh Chassib has informed him by letter that, from the Persian Government’s point of view, there is no objection to his return. Steps have been taken by His Majesty’s Embassy to ascertain the truth of his statement.11. i he Anglo-Iranian Oil Company report increasing lawlessness in the refinery area of Abadan. The incidents include armed robbery, a knife attack on a British employee and shooting in the refinery itself. In these acts the Tudeh are not, so far, considered to be directly implicated. Recent arrests of police officials and the iack of an efficient military governor are thought to have caused a lowering of police morale and, hence, an increase in hooliganism. n us hire 12. According to a consular report dated 26th October, the Hayat Daudi tribesmen are still in complete control of Bushire town. The other ranks of the captured garrison were allowed to disperse but the officers are still in confinement though being treated well. Khosro Qashgai and General Zahedi are expected to arrive in Bushire shortly when it will become known whether the “ Tribal Union of the Coast was included in the recent agreement concluded between Nasir Khan Qashgai and the Central Government. Persian A rmy 13. General Ridley, chief of the American Military Mission to the Persian army, has resigned and has been succeeded by Brigadier-General Grow. The continuous ill-health of Mrs. Ridley ever since her arrival in Persia a year ago led General Ridley to take this step. While it cannot be said that he accomplished much, his departure is regretted by all. He was courteous, hard working and loyal to his conception of his duty to the Persian army. 14. General Hasan Arfa (see paragraph 14 of Intelligence Summary No. 40), has been freed from arrest and permitted to live at his country house in residence forcee. The disappearance from the Cabinet of Muzaffar Firuz and the three Tudeh ministers made it possible for the Minister of War, backed up by the new Minister of Justice, to persuade the Prime Minister to permit this on condition that the military court to try General Arfa should be convened as soon as possible. The Minister of War is confident of securing an acquittal. 15. Sartip Darakshani, the former G.O.C. Tabriz, who was arrested in December 1945 on his arrival in Tehran for having shamefully surrendered to the Azerbaijan Democrats (see paragraph 2 of Intelligence Summary No. 48 and paragraph 8 of Intelligence Summary No. 49 both of 1945) has now been released. He has never been brought to trial. This is not surprising. Firstly, in Persia, though arrests are common, trials are rare. Secondly, he would appear to have had an excellent defence in view of the instructions he received at the time from the then Prime Minister. 16. In connexion with the birthday celebrations of His Imperial Majesty The Shah a parade of the II (Tehran) Division was held on 28th October. A massed P.T. display was followed by bayonet fighting to music in the old style and a very creditable exhibition of field firing for rifle squads. New colours were presented to the 27th Infantry Regiment. The parade concluded with a march past of the division. Persian Gendarmerie 17.

A personality note on “ General ' Daneshian of the Azerbaijan people s army, compiled by His Majesty’s Consul-General. Tabriz, is included as an appendix to this summary. Russian Interests ^ 20. According to the Persian press, out of 150,000 Armenians in Persia. 60.000 have elected to emigrate to Soviet Armenia and 12.000 of these have already left. T ailyiece Regarding the Armenian emigration to Russia, referred to in paragraph 20 above, an amusing story is going round Tehran. Two letters, written by recent emigrants to their relations in Persia were intercepted and read by the Persian postal authorities. The first letter read: ‘‘Here everything is lovely. Food, clothing and work are abundant. Soviet Armenia is a veritable paradise. We are very happy. The only person who was not so happy was Uncle Joseph. I ncle Joseph died last week.” The writer of the second letter, after similar eulogies, advised his relatives to defer their departure from Persia till ” the marriage ceremonies of Petros are concluded.” Subsequent enquiries from the family in Persia elicited the informa tion that Petros was a baby of one year old. Appendix Personality Note on General Ghulam Yahya Daneshian GENERAL DANESHIAN speaks Russian well, having been educated in that country, and it is said that he served with the Russian army in the Caucasus for a short time. In 1937 he came to Azerbaijan and settled in Sarab, a village about half vyay between Tabriz and Ardebil. Some time later he was arrested by the Persian authorities on the charge of being a Soviet agent, and was imprisoned in Tehran. On the Russian occupation of Azerbaijan he obtained his release and went to live in Tabriz. On the formation of the Tudeh Party Daneshian lost no time in joining it, and he was given the task of organising a branch at Sarab, and later another at Mianeh. At the latter village he came into active conflict with the Kherieh Party, which was strongly opposed to the Tudeh. and in the course of a skirmish Daneshian was wounded. This provoked the wrath of the Russian Commander of troops in Azerbaijan, General Glinski, who, as a reprisal, cast several of the leading personalities in Mianeh into prison in Tabriz. The formation of the Azerbaijan Democrat Party brought Daneshian an appointment as commander of the Fida'is in Mianeh and Zenjan. The landlords in Mianeh district decided to leave for Tehran for security and, in their absence, Daneshian looted their properties for his personal benefit with the result that he is now one of the wealthiest men in Azerbaijan. Pishavari promoted Daneshian to the rank of General on 5th April, 1946, his charge being the Fida'is in Sarab as well as in Mianeh and Zenjan. When the agreement was reached *&gt;etween Azerbaijan and the Central Government on 16th June. 1946, Daneshian was promoted to be Commander-in-chief of the Fida’is and established himself in Tabriz. He makes frequent tours of inspection of Azerbaijan in connexion with his duties and is reputed to enjoy the confidence of the Russians to the same extent as Pishavari himself. Daneshian is reputed to be possessed of exceptional courage and determination, and the Democrat Party, including Pishavari, fear and hate him.■■■ — ^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT PERSIA November 20, 1946 CONFIDENTIAL Section 1 [E 11341/315/34] Copy No, J |j g Military Attache s Intelligence Summary No. 44, Secret, for the Period \th November to \Qth November, 1946.

An official announcement addressed to the Ministry of the Interior by the Persian Prime Minister directs that the elections shall be concluded within a space of five days ending on 21st December. Internal Security Bakhtiari 2. It was natural that considerable resentment should be felt by those Bakhtiari Khans who became the victims of Abul Qasim s recent intrigues and, in Tehran, there is talk of a concerted move to have him replaced by Muhammad Taqi Khan, Amir Jang, son of the late Sardar Asad, a Deputv in the last Majlis. He belongs to the Ilkhani branch of the tribe and married a daughter of Sardar Muhtashim of the Haji Ilkhani branch. Murteza Quli Khan is said to be in favour of this and even the Haji Ilkhani section are reported to have given the project their blessing. Azerbaijan (see paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary) 3. To the list of losses in arms sustained by the Persian Army's garrisons- when they surrendered in Azerbaijan should be added the following :— (i) One x four gun battery of 37-mm. A/Tk. guns. (ii) One company of 85-mni. Brandt mortars = 8 mortars. (iii) Three medium and three light tanks. (iv) The medium machine gun component of three infantry regiments = 54 machine guns. (v) The light machine gun component of three infantry regiments = 243 machine guns. 4. His Majesty's Consul-General at Tabriz reports that the Azerbaijan Government seems to be apprehensive of an attack by the Persian army on their forces at Zenjan. The Chief of the General Staff informed the British military attache on 10th November that the Azerbaijan forces facing the Zulfiqari partisans had withdrawn from Zarrinabad (I. 39. AY. 1532) about 65 miles south of Zenjan to Yangikand (J. 39. S K. 4642) about 48 miles further north. Other adjustments have also been made which have resulted in a shortening of their defensive line to the south and south-east of Zenjan. His Majesty’s Consul- General regards the conscripts of the Azerbaijan People’s Army as badly led and having no stomach for a fight and even the picked force of “ Fidais ” as having had in fact, very little training. He regards the recent bellicose utterances of their leaders and the recent troop movements as more bluff to intimidate the Central Government and is of the opinion that, unless extensive military aid were forthcoming from the Russians, they would be easily disposed of in battle by the Persian Army.^ The Chief of the General Staff further informed the British military attache on 10th November that, according to an oral agreement reached between Qawam-us-Saltaneh and Dr. Javid, the Governor-General of Azerbaijan, during the latter’s stay in Tehran, the Azerbaijan Democrat forces are to evacuate Zenjan by 16th November. The recent southward troop movements from Tabriz to Zenjan would seem to give the lie to this statement. f 83—163]Kurdistan (reference paragraph 6 of last Intelligence Summary) 5. The Chief of the General Staff informed the assistant British military attache that on 5th November the Kurds actually succeeded in capturing the heights surrounding the Persian army garrison town of Sardasht but weie expelled by a successful counter attack on the following day. According to the Chief of the General Staff, the Russians during the past few days ha\e suppliec arms (chiefly grenades) and 2,000 uniforms to the Kurds. Pars 6. His Majesty's consul at Shiraz reports that General Zahedi is trying to broaden the basis of the Fars Autonomy Movement by including the townsfolk or Shiraz and other cities and also by drawing into its orbit the Khamseh tribes. His object in this is, firstly, as stated, to widen its scope and secondly to provide a counter weight to Qashgai influence. K huzistan 7. Further acts of robbery are reported from Abadan by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The pressing need of despatching a military governor and a chief of police to Abadan has been brought home to the Minister of War and the C hief of the General Staff. Bushire (see paragraph 12 of last Intelligence Summary) 8. According to His Majesty s consul at Bushire, Hayat Daudi has made a request through Nasir Khan Qashgai to General Zahedi to despatch an official to take over the administration of Bushire on behalf of the Persian Government. The same source reports that all the tribesmen have now evacuated Bushire town except fifty who are remaining temporarily to carry out police duties. Persian Army 9. The presentation by His Imperial Majesty, The Shah, of colours to the 27th Infantry Regiment of the 2nd (Tehran) Division was mentioned in para graph 16 of last Intelligence Summary. This regiment and the 26th, part of the 1st (Tehran) Division, were originally raised as training regiments at the suggestion of the American military mission. They were included as such in the order of battle dated 31st December, 1945. The scheme did not meet with the approval of the General Staff who preferred to adhere to their old practice of training recruits within their own active battalions and the two regiments referred to have since been raised to the status of active regiments. 10. The Chief of the General Staff informed the British assistant military attache on 6th November that he was negotiating the purchase of some military- equipment from the Russians. The question of a Russian military mission accompanying the equipment had not been raised again. The items under discussion were :— (i) 200 x 50-mm. mortars. (ii) 100 motor-cycle combinations (iii) 30 armoured cars. (iv) 10 tanks. (v) Ammunition for the Persian Army pattern of sub-machine gun. This weapon has a calibre of 7 -62-mm., whereas the small arms ammunition manufactured in the Persian Army arsenal for their B.R.N.O. rifles and machine guns is of 7 -92-mm. Payment for the above would be made out of the Persian Government's blocked gold balances in Moscow (obtained by the sale of rials to the Russians during the war). A ppointments A.— Civil —(i) Jawad Bushihri, Amir Humayun, has been confirmed in his appoint ment as Governor-General of Fars. (ii) Mohsin Tartibi to be Governor of Shahsowar. (iii) Musa Sang to be Governor of Mahallat. (iv) Mustafa Quli Kheradi to be Governor of Qazvin. (v) Itisam Qadimi to be Governor of Isafahan and assistant to the Governor-General of the 10th Ustan.3 B .—Military General Muhammad Husein Firuz, Minister of Roads and Communications in the last Cabinet, has reverted to military duty and has been appointed Inspector of the Eastern Forces (Khorasan and Kerman Divisions). ^ Obituary 12 . On 4th November at Kadhimain, Iraq, aged 83, His Reverence Haj Ayatullah Seyyid Abul Hasan Isfahani, the leading Shia Mujtahid of Persia. A memorial service, attended by His Imperial Majesty The Shah, was held in Tehran and two days’ mourning were observed. Two names are mentioned as possible successors, Haj Agha Husein Burujirdi Tabatabai and Haj Agha Husein Qumi. Br itish Interests 13. Reference paragraph 16 of Intelligence Summary No. 41 agreement between the Imperial Bank of Iran and the Persian Government has been reached on the following lines :— (a) All commercial banks operating in Iran will be required to make a non- interest-bearing deposit with the Central Bank equivalent to 15 per cent, of their total demand deposits, and 6 per cent, of their fixed deposits. (b) The Imperial Bank of Iran undertakes to carry Government Paper up to an amount equivalent to 15 per cent, of their total deposits.

Tho Minister for War, as next senior member of tho Cabinet, is acting for him during his absence. His suddon departure has given rise to a crop of rumours. These include tales to tho effect that ho has been dismissed, that ho is having a clandestine meeting with tho Russians, and that ho is avoiding the onus of tho responsibility for forceful action which has boon taken against strikers or may bo started against Azerbaijan, There is no reliable Information to confirm tho accuracy of any of those tales* on tho contrary tho probabilit}?- of his return in normal fashion Is indicated by tho statement of tho Chief of the General Staff to tho Assistant Military Attachd that no military action against Azerbaijan would bo initiated until tho Prime Minister had returned and made a doc is ion, 2 , On 12th November, tho Tudeh Party, after an Interview with tho Supremo Labour Council, declared a general strike for 24 hours of all Tehran workers including those of the State Railways, This action was presumably designed to demonstrate the strength of the'Party In that tho pretexts ware somewhat artificial. Thoso were, first, the appointment of Khusro HIdayot to bo Director'-Goner a 1 of tho Railways In place of tho Tudoh member Mussadiq (see Intelligence Summary No.43 of 3rd November 1946, paragraph 18(H)); secondly, tho death of a Tudoh supporter at the hands of Democrat followers in a political clash in tho railway stores on 10th Novombor; and, thirdly, the refusal of tho Government to divulge the place of the secret burial of tho victim 1 s body. Thoso throe factors were presented as showing tho oppression and cruelty to which tho honest worker would now be subjected as a - result of this appointment. General Ahmodi, as Acting Prime Minister, summoned Tudoh loaders and told thorn that ho would stand no nonsonso and that any attempts to promote tho strike would bo ruthlessly put down. Strike loaders served strike not-io-B* to employees coming to work and pickets wore established. -Qonoral Ahmodi called out Police and tho Military in support, 150 of thoso serving notices wore arrested and pickets wore broken up. As a result of thoso measures the strike was only 50$ successful a figure far below any previous effort of tho Party (when it was aided by a Tudoh-dominatod Cabinet) - and the Government is congratulating Itself on a victory. ~ - • /3# At tho( V w ?

Tho evacuation of Zenjan by tho Azerbaijan Democrat Forces has boon officially announced in tho Press. Tho Minister for War told tho Military Attache on 14th November that tho ‘iz-id-bash*’,, numbering about 1,500, had evacuated the town but that the Azerbaijan Democrats say that the ,, Fidais u will stay until tho Persian Government on their part disarm and remove the Zulfaqari and Afshar partisans. Ho added that ho had 'summoned tho loaders of those tribes to Tehran but that ho had no intention of cither disarming or removing their followers. (Note. The name ’’KizilbagHJ',, i.o. 'redhead” was the name which was given to Azerbaijani soldiers of tho Persian'Army in Qa jar times and which has now boon resurrected. The 'Fidais', i.o. 'devotoos”, are 'Party” Mon whereas tho '‘'izllbash'' is tho general soldier). ° c In the meanwhile the Press announces that Government Gendarmerie forces have reached Zonjan, having been precodod by their commander, Gargurd Farrukhzad, who want ahead to prepare for their arrival. In modification of this report the Chief of the General Staff told tho Assistant Military Attach^ on tho 16th that cno company had ' arrived and that a second would follow. (Note. These are presumably tho two companies montionod as having moved to Qazvin in paragraph 10 of Intelligence Summary No,35 dated 8 th September 1946).

For several months the Persian Prime Minister has con sistently refused to agree to the Minister for War’s repeated requests for permission to undertake military operations in order to reassert the Persian Government's authority in this province which, forming no part of Azerbaijan, was nevertheless taken over by the Azerbaijan rebels. What induced the Prime Minister to change his mind can be told in the words of his ow T n communique issued on 23rd November :— “ From the very first moment that I accepted the responsibilities of the Govern ment I have always been trying to settle the existing troubles, and especially the situation of Azerbaijan, with complete good understanding. During the negotia tions with the Azerbaijan delegates it was arranged that the Khamseh province should be completely evacuated by the Azerbaijan Democrats, and that they should withdraw their ‘ Fidais and armed forces from there. “ Although the evacuation was to be completed six months ago, yet every time under new pretexts it was postponed. At last according to the discussions which were carried out in Tehran, it was agreed that the Zenjan zone be evacuated on 14th November and thus this question should be settled once and for all. “ According to same agreement a mission including well-informed and trusted officers left for Zenjan to meet this end. Unfortunately despite all negotiations and promises, on 18th November Colonel Bu. Esshaghi, head of the expeditionary mission to Zenjan, was shot at by one of the officers of Azerbaijan. On the same day, a number of the ‘ Fidais ’ suddenly attadked the Police Department, and insulted and even detained the mission’s officers. 84—61 “ There were also reports from other parts of Zenjan. and especially from Karsaf, which indicated that the Demo crats ‘ Fidais ' had even raped the women of the villages or married them by force. “ Therefore, in order to prevent such happenings, a military column was instructed last night (22nd November) to leave for Zenjan under the command of Colonel Hashemi to ensure the maintenance of order and security and establishing of military government throughout Zenjan.” According to the Minister for War, the column consists of four battalions of infantry, a battery of artillery, six tanks and a mortar detachment. It left Qazvin at midnight on 22nd-23rd November partly in M.T. by the main Qazvin-Tabriz road and partly by rail. No opposition was shown by the “Fidais” road posts, who were taken completely by surprise. Zenjan was occupied on the morning of 23rd November and part of the force has moved on to Sarcham about 20 miles short of Mianeh, on the provincial boundary between Azerbaijan and Khamseh. The “ Fidais ” are reported to have either with drawn or gone into hiding. In the press numerous reports have appeared which tell of the revenge being taken by the villagers against them for their numerous acts of oppression while in occupation of the province. The Persian Army appears to have met with a warm reception, being hailed as deliverers. 2. The Prime Minister has issued the following directive to .provincial officials concerning the forthcoming elections :— Clause 1.—In order to carry out the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and in accordance with clause 14 of the Elections Act, twenty-four persons representing the six different classes of the people, and twelve persons who are impartial, unbiassed and trusted by the people must be selected and presented ineach constituency within five days according to clauses 16 and 21 of the Elections Act. Clause 2 .—After the publication of the elections notice and the appointment of an interval between this date, the distribution of ballots and the polling, the details must be reported to Tehran by telegram. Clause 3.—Refers to the period of the whole procedure, which must not exceed five days; this period is also in conformity with clause 28 of the Elections Act. Clause 4.—Recommends the increase in number of supervisory bureaux, which will facilitate the completion of the work in five days. Clause 5.—Speaks of maintenance of order throughout the period of polling, so that it may enable the people to cast their votes freely without any apprehension or prejudice. For this purpose the Government intends to send armed forces from Tehran to all constitu encies through the whole country without any exception ; and as soon as these forces arrive in their destinations the elections will start. Clause 6 .—Refers to the forgeries that may occur in the voting ballots, and for that purpose the Ministry of the Interior intends to send special officials to all the constituencies to supervise the course of the elections in co-operation with the security forces sent from Tehran. These officials will daily send their reports to Tehran. At the end of the statement the Prime Minister expresses hope that all the electors will take into account the signifi cance of the elections, and will act in such a way as not to transgress the principles of order so that all may enjoy the freedom which is granted them by law. Regarding the Persian Government’s intentions to send armed forces to the various constituencies according to the Minister for War, the Azerbaijan Administration has already telegraphed to the Prime Minister to say that in no circumstances will it permit the entry of Persian Government forces into Azerbaijan. Internal Security Khuzistan 3. The new Military Governor and Chief of Police for Abadan have not yet arrived but are believed to be on their way. A marked improvement in the situation has been caused by the arrest, trial and convic tion of about 120 notorious bad characters Further arrests are being made. Fars 4. The Governor-General has told His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz that a commis sion is leaving shortly to reinstate the Governor and Director of Customs at Bus- hire and to reopen the branches of the National Bank at Kazerun and Bushire. Gendarmerie posts on the Shiraz-Bushire road are to he re-established with local recruitment. Each gendarme will receive pay at rials 1,000 per mensem, uniform and ammunition, but is to provide his own rifle. The same source adds that this arrange ment is to be extended gradually to cover the whole of Fars. So far the tribes have not returned any of the 3,000 rifles taken from the garrisons which surrendered. 5. The Governor-General is discussing with the Prime Minister the list of the candidates to be elected to the next Majlis. It is unlikely that any one not sponsored by the Qashgai will be elected and they have not so far produced their list of nominees. Zahidan and Zabul 6 . Though the Russian Consulate at Zabul has been closed officially, the so-called Russian Secretary has twice attempted to give official parties at the former consulate. The local governor has so far prevented this and has pointed out that he is, in fact, merely a caretaker. Russian propaganda still reaches the Zabulis through their reading room. 7. The Governor-General of Mekran, on the occasion of a recent visit to Zahidan, informed His Majesty’s Consul that the Shah had proclaimed a general amnesty for Baluch tribes in respect of the recent disorders. 8 . The Governor-General also tried to persuade all possible local candidates for election to the next Majlis to stand down in favour of Arbab Mehdi, a member of the Iran Democrat Party.

On 24th November the Soviet Ambassador enquired both from His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Persian Prime Minister whether it was the Persian Government’s intention to send its troops into Azerbaijan. The Shah replied that the General Staff had no plan for such an operation and that a decision on this point could only be taken in the light of future events. When putting the same question to the Prime Minister the Soviet Ambassador added that the occupation of Zen j an and his recent proclamation regarding the supervision of the elections suggested that Government forces would soon enter Azerbaijan. The Prime Minister, apparently with more courage and greater regard for truth than the Shah, replied that both these decisions were attributable solely to the Government’s exercise of its normal functions, that troops had gone to Zen j an because the “ Fidais had attacked the gendarmerie and that other forces would be sent to Azerbaijan to ensure orderly elections. On 28th November the Soviet Ambassador again called upon the Prime Minister and in formed him that his Government would view with disfavour the advance of Persian Government troops into Azer baijan as it would lead inevitably to disturbances in that province. A Cabinet meeting was called for that evening, but it is not known for certain what decisions were reached. Qawam-us-Saltaneh may be considering an appeal to the Security Council against what appears to be a definite instance of Russian interference. He may proceed with his plan to send troops into Azerbaijan in accordance with the terms of his own proclamation and to make his appeal to U.N.O. only in the event of their being opposed. Again, he may prefer to wait and let the Russians make their own deductions of no troops, no elec tions : no elections, no Majlis : no Majlis, no oil concession. 2. The Prime Minister has sent a tele gram to Dr. Javid, the Governor-General of Azerbaijan, complaining, firstly, that the Azerbaijan army is constructing a defensive position on the Qaflan Kuh (the prominent feature overlooking the gorge of the Qizil Uzun River about 10 miles south of Mianeh); secondly, that the delay in holding the elections which would follow the opposition to the entry of the Govern ment’s forces is against the interests of the country; and, thirdly, that if elections are held elsewhere disregard by the Azerbaijan Administration of the laws of the country can only lead to the non-recognition by the Majlis of any Azerbaijan’s Deputies elected by its present Administration. 3. A Government commission, composed of the Ministers of Justice, Finance and Public Health, has visited Zen j an to hear complaints from the inhabitants of injus tice done to them by the Azerbaijan Demo crats during the period of their occupation, to arrange for the re-establishment of certain Government departments and to provide for future supplies of controlled commodities such as tea, sugar and cloth. Internal Security A zerbaijan 4. The Tabriz press and radio have pro tested loudly against what they are pleased to call Qawam-us-Saltaneh’s treachery in sending troops to Zen j an. Their tone con tinues to be bellicose and they avow that Azerbaijan will never submit to a similar dishonour Nearly all of the available troops and £t Fidais ” have been sent from Tabriz to Mianeh and Ardebil in readiness to repel attacks by the Persian army and the Shahsevan tribal partisans of govern ment respectively. His Majesty’s Consul- General at Tabriz reports that two 84-792 k Russians arrived there by Intourist plane from Tehran on 25th November, and summoned Pishevari to the Russian Consu late, where it is reported, but not con firmed that they advised him not to resist the entry of Persian Government troops into Azerbaijan. K hamseh (Z enjari) 5. The Chief of the General Staff in formed the British Military Attache on 28th November that the military situation on the North-West “Front was as follows (described from west to east) :— Sardasht (J-38 V, G 90), the evacuation of which by Persian Government troops was demanded by the Azerbaijan Demo crats and refused by the Persian Govern ment, has been reinforced and, for the moment, there is no fighting in progress in the neighbourhood. Thence, through Saqqiz (J-38 W, H 61) to Tikab (J-38 X, J 43) the Persian army is in sufficient strength and no fighting is taking place. From Tikab to the main Zenjan-Tabriz road is occupied by the Afshar partisans of Government. The Zulfiqari partisans have moved up from Anguran (J-38 X, J 9355) to Yangijeh (J-39 S, K 7878). The main body of the Persian army brigade group, which advanced from Qazvin, is still at Zen j an and has now been reinforced by a regiment of cavalry from Qazvin. The advanced guard of this force is at Tazekand (J-38 R, B 1810) on the pro vincial boundary between Khamseh and Azerbaijan. About a week ago a party of Shahsevan tribal partisans of Government, moving south from Ardebil, captured Hirau (J-39 M, E 6773), and a further party is occupying the track from Zen j an to that place. Attempts are being made to organise a tribal sector on the remaining position of the front, i.e., from Hirau to the Caspian coast at or near Karganrud. The Chief of the General Staff thinks that an efficient link up of this extensive and heterogeneous front is an essential pre liminary to any further advance into Azerbaijan. Khuzistan 6 . Another case of burglary and assault has taken place in the residential area of Abadan, when a British employee of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was severely wounded by a mixed gang of Arab and Persian thieves. 7. A branch of the Iran Democrat Party has been opened in Khorramshahr, but Tudeh opposition has so far prevented any large adherence to the party. The Russian Consul at Ahwaz has been active in has bee opposing recruitment to the Iran Democrat America Party. elements Appointments articles in doub; “A'—Civil f*% ^^ast acci 8 .—(i) Mudabbir Nuri, Mudabbir-us- ^^is seekir Saltaneh, to be Governor of Yezd.

The Tudeh organ Rahbar in the course of the past week has come out with three violent attacks against American ‘‘dollar diplomacy'' and “imperialism,” in which latter respect America is stated to have donned the mantle previously worn by Britain, now, on account of her economic plight, reduced to a position of minor importance. America’s desire for oil con cessions in Baluchistan (hardly alluded to since the concession hunters left Persia early in 1944), the presence of American advisers in the gendarmerie and army, the virtual control of Iranian Airways by T.W.A., the rumour of a loan by America to Persia are all adduced as proofs of a growing American stranglehold on Persia. The remarks of the American Ambassador, in reply to a question by a newspaper correspondent, to the effect that the Persian Government’s recent decision to send its troops into all constituencies to ensure the freedom of the elections seemed to him a normal and sensible procedure,3 has been hailed as further proof of American support for “reactionary” elements. The source from which these artu les were inspired, if indeed it was ever in doubt, is made abundantly clear by a ^A|ast accusation to the effect that America is seeking to establish in Persia air bases from which to launch attacks on Russia. Turkish Interests 11 . Lieutenant-Colonel Jelal Orgo has arrived as military attach^. The appoint ment has been vacant for more than a year. This is Lieutenant-Colonel Jelal Orgo’s second tour of duty as he was Military Attach^, Tehran, with the rank of captain, from 1933 to 1936. He informed the British Military Attache that he was Turkish Military Attache in France (Vichy) between 1941 and 1944. During his first tour of duty in Tehran, which coincided with a previous tour of duty of the British Military Attache, Captain Jelal was a very helpful colleague.■■■■■ mmi JK. f t A THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT SECRET PERSIA December 20, 1946 Section 1 &gt;^E 12298/315/34 / ' Copy ^.^3 MILITARY ATTACHE’S INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY, No. 48, SECRET For the Period 2nd December to 8th December, 1946 (Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 498 of llth December; Received 20£A December) Persian Affairs Political It will present a clearer picture if, before continuing the narrative of events from paragraph 1 of last Intelligence Summary, the correspondence between the Persian Prime Minister and the Governor- General of Azerbaijan, summarised in paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary, is brought up to date. The reply to the Prime Minister’s letter to Dr. Jawid came not from him, but from the President of the Azerbaijan Provincial Council. It was to the effect that the despatch of Government troops into Azerbaijan was unnecessary and improper, unnecessary in that Persian Government inspectors would be sufficient to ensure the free conduct of the elections, unnecessary also in that the “ Fidais,” recognised by the agreement of last June, were a sufficient force, and improper in that the despatch of troops was in violation of the said agreement. The Prime Minister’s reply to Dr. Jawid was forceful and to the point. He said that the Provincial Council had no juris diction over these affairs and 1 that Dr. Jawid, as Governor-General, had exceeded his powers in referring the matter to them. The Persian Government’s action in no way contravened any agreement reached between it and the Azerbaijan Administration. Azerbaijan could not have laws differing from those in force in the rest of Persia. The present forces in Azerbaijan did not enjoy the confidence of the populace. If the Azerbaijan Adminis tration accepted the entry of Government troops with goodwill, there need be no anxiety. If they opposed it, then the blame for any subsequent happenings must lie at their door. 2 . The language used by the Soviet Ambassador to the Prime Minister in his interview of 28th November was described in paragraph 1 of last Intelligence Summary. A second interview took place on 3rd December, when the ambassador, on instructions from his Government, informed him that, if Persian Government troops were sent into Azerbaijan, disorders would inevitably ensue with consequent danger to the security of the Russian fron tier. Parallel action was taken in Moscow, where Muzaffar Firuz was warned of the serious consequences of the action which the Persian Government proposed to take. The Persian Prime Minister thereupon instructed the Persian delegate at U.N.O. to inform the Secretary-General of the Security Council of the Soviet Govern ment’s action and to add that, nevertheless, the Persian Government intends to send its troops into Azerbaijan. On 4th December the Soviet Ambassador saw the Prime Minister again and repeated his message of 3rd December, adding that the Persian Government’s proposed action “would create a situation on the Russian frontier which the Soviet Government could not ignore.’’ He finished by saying that, if the Prime Minister persisted in his plans, the Soviet Government would be obliged to revise their opinion of him personally. According to Mr. Nikpay, the Prime Minister's chief assistant, who was sent to the British Ambassador to give him the above report, the Prime Minister replied that Azerbaijan was either a part of Persia or it was not. If it was, then the Persian Government's proposed action was of no concern to the Soviet Government. If it was not, then the sooner the fact was made known to the world the better. As regards himself, he had no desire to remain in office a day longer than the interests of his country required. The substance of the above conversation has also been conveyed by the Persian Government to the Persian Ambassador in Washington. 3. According to the Persian press, four Cabinet Ministers who are seeking election to the 15th Majlis will resign, as the 85-142 Constitutional Law forbids a Government executive to stand as a candidate for election. The four concerned are Mania wizadeh, Minister of Justice; Farmanfarmayan, Minister of Labour and Propaganda; Nikpay, Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones; Sadiqi, Minister of Roads and Communications. The Elections 4. There is no reliable news about the elections, but it is known that the Council of Ministers is divided on the issue. The Prime Minister wishes to bake a profit from the sudden wave of popularity which has swept over the country on account of his decision to reoccupy Zenjan, his firm hand with the Tudeh and the reports of his stand against the Russians over Azerbai jan. The organisation of his Iran Demo crat Party is well advanced and he is confident of the election of his supporters in most of the country. To proceed with the elections throughout Persia, however, without having first secured the entry of Persian Government troops into Azerbai jan would damage his prestige as having gone back on his avowed intentions and would, of course, result in the election of a solid bloc of twenty-two (twenty-one Azer baijan seats plus one for the Northern Armenians) Russian nominees. To carry on with the elections in all areas excluding Azerbaijan would be a dangerous course and might so enrage the Azerbaijan Administration as to induce them to take the plunge by seceding from Persia and ♦ ‘” f or inclusion in voting unanimously the U.S.S.R. According to a statement made by the Prime Minister to the Reuter's corres pondent in Tehran, the elections have been started in Azerbaijan by the Administra tion of that province. The Prime Minister added that, under the circumstances, they would have no validity. Internal Security A zerbaijan 5. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports great efforts on the part of the Azerbaijan Administration to whip up enthusiasm for the struggle against the troops of the Central Government and to raise additional forces to oppose their entry. One such organisation of older men on a volunteer basis has been begun under the name of “ Bahak ” (presumably so- called either after the Persian hero) Ardeshir Babak or with the meaning of “ fathers’ force,” Babak being diminutiv of Bab = a father). The same source reports that reinforcements, consisting of entirely untrained factory hands, are being hurriedly armed and dratted into the ranks of the Azerbaijan People’s Army, the “Fidais” and the Babak force. 0 6 . On 8 th December the Chief of the^ General Staff gave the British Military Attache the latest information concerning the situation which was recorded in para graph 5 of last Intelligence Summary. It is as follows : — Tazekand (J-38 R, B 1810) The force has now been reinforced by two infantry battalions to a total of six, plus one battalion of gendarmes. The main body has moved to this place from Zenjan and is holding a line running, roughly, from the Qizil Uzun river at Raj in (J-38 R, E 1 ) to Aq Kand (J-39 M, E 23). Two battalions have been left as a reserve in Zenjan. On 4th December a force of about 200 irregular cavalry of the Afshar partisans of Government attacked a Democrat outpost in Raj in and drove them thence. The Democrats sustained casual ties amounting to 12 killed, including a renegade officer of the Persian army by the name of Lieutenant Gulmuhammedi. The partisans had 4 killed. According to the Chief of the General Staff 45 kilog. of explosive were found in the village after its capture. Other booty included three machine guns, part of those lost in Azer baijan when the Persian army garrisons surrendered. The cartridges for those, according to the same source, were of two sorts, viz., German, made of steel instead of brass and Czechoslovakian with a red base and a dum-dum type of bullet. The force, of about one battalion in strength, which moved on 6 th December from Taze kand to Aq Kand met with no opposition.

Remainder of front, no change except that a force of Government supporters from the Talish area is being organised to fill the gap between Hirau and the Caspian coast at Karganrud. The Lnited States Air Attach^ and Assi stant Mi 1 itary Attache made two flights on 2 nd and 5th December as far as Mianeh keeping along the line of the main road. They saw the Azerbaijan forces con centrated—in a strength unstated—in the forward areas of the Qaflan Kuh gorge. Many of the troops seen round bridges and manning trenches on the outward flight were not visible when they returned. The air attache claims to have seen an unspeci fied number of 37 mm. anti-tank guns. Twenty troop-carrying lorries were observed in the barrad^s at Mianeh. (Note by British military attache; presumably the police or gendarmerie barracks are meant as there are no Persian army barracks at Mianeh.) Gilan 7. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Resht reports that the situation in the former Tudeh stronghold at Pahlevi has much improved after the arrival of a detachment of troops and the appointment of a Colonel Pahlevannejad as military governor with wide powers. Several notorious Tudeh members, including the mayor and the harbourmaster, have teen dismissed. A detachment of Persian troops has teen stationed at the aerodrome, up till now in undisputed possession of the Russians, in order to prevent a possible repetition of an incident of a few days ago when a Persian military aircraft was refused permission to land. His Imperial Majesty the Shah, who visited Pahlevi in his own aircraft on 29th November, for the first time in five years, was accorded an emotional welcome by the populace. Mazanderan 8 . The Chief of the General Staff, on 8 th December, gave the British Military Attache some information additional to that appearing in the Persian press on the subject of the recent attacks on Persian .army detachments by workmen from the cotton mills at Shahi and from the coal mines at Zirab (on the Iranian State Rail way about 20 miles south of Shahi). At both these places the small Persian army detachments on 3rd December were sud denly attacked, surrounded and disarmed. A battalion from Tehran and another from Gurgan were sent to the two places with commendable promptitude and succeeded in arresting the authors of the disturb ances and in recovering the arms. Martial law has teen proclaimed in the whole area and four of the ringleaders were publicly hanged in Shahi on 8 th December. Accord ing to the Chief of the General Staff the assailants were Azerbaijani Turks with out Persian nationality papers. These elements have now teen removed from the mills and coal mines. Some hand grenades of Russian army pattern, according to the same source, were found in the possession of the insurgents. Isfahan 9. His Majesty’s Consul at Isfahan reports that the G.O.C., 9th (Isfahan) Divi sion, has teen instructed to provide reinforcements for the Khamseh front amounting to 1,000 men. He also reports that on instructions from Tehran, the G.O.C. has asked Abul Qasim Khan to provide a tribal force of Bakhtiari irregular cavalry and that Abul Qasim has agreed to provide 250.

The attacks on American policy in Persia continue in the newspapers Rahbar and Zafar (see paragraph 10 of last Intel ligence Summary). In an article which appeared on 3rd December Rahbar struck a new note by accusing the Americans of landing troops in Persia. It went on to suggest that, as the Persian army and gendarmerie were under American control, the advance of Persian Government forces into Azerbaijan would, in reality, amount to an American threat to Soviet territory. The obvious deduction from the article was that such a situation would arise which was covered by article 6 of the 1921 Perso- Russian Treaty. The article reads as follows :— “ VI. If a third party should attempt to carry out a policy of usurpation by means of armed intervention in Persia, or if such Power should desire to use Persian territory as a base of operations against Russia, or if a foreign Power should threaten the frontiers of Federal Russia or those of its allies, and if the Persian Government should not be able to put a stop to such menace after having been once called upon to do so by Russia, Russia shall have the right to advance her troops into the Persian interior for the purpose of carrying out the military operations necessary for its defeno^r Russia undertakes, however, to withdraw' her troops from Persian territory as soon as the danger has been removed.” The Press 12. An announcement in the Journal de Tehran reports the suspension of the papers Rahbar, the Tudeh organ, and Zafar, the Workers’ Union organ, by the Military Governor of Tehran. They have reappeared under the names of Bashar and Shahbaz respectively. Liberation 13. Ahmed Ali Sepehr, Muwiarrikh-ud- Dowleh, who was banished to Kashan in July (see Intelligence Summary No. 26, paragraph 16 (ii)), has returned to Tehran and has had an interview with the Prime Minister.-wr- / »A- i n THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC M/UESTY’S GOVERNMENT SECRET E 12483/315/34 PERSIA December 30, 1946 Section 1 Copy No. 160 MILITARY ATTACHE’S INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY No. 49 Period 9th-15th December (Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 506 of 17th December; Received Stith December) Persian Affairs Political The outstanding event of the week has been the advance of the Persian Govern ment forces into Azerbaijan and the resulting collapse of the Azerbaijan Democrat and the Kurdish Independence movements. The advance was in no way provoked by either side, but was ordered by the Persian Prime Minister in accordance with his previously announced intention of sending his troops into all parts of the country to ensure the freedom of the elections. The rapidity of the rebels’ collapse, the sudden cessation of Russian aid to the movement and the absence, so far, of any sign of Russian reactions to the reoccupation of Azerbaijan have come as a surprise to many, though His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz has for some months been of the opinion that the Azerbaijan Administrations bellicose utterances were largely bluff and that their “ Fidais” and people’s army were but a cardboard facade erected to hide the naked ness of the land and the intense unpopu larity of their regime. The British Military Attache, at the invitation of the Chief of the General Staff, visited the Zenjan front on 11th December and saw some of the fighting which preceded the capture of the Qaflan Kuh gorge, which guards the approach from the south to Mianeh. His impressions of the Persian army at work and of the general condition of the countryside will be submitted in a separate report. The situation, based on the latest information given by the Chief of the General Staff to the British Military Attache, is described in para graph 3. 2 . There is general rejoicing at the successful conclusion of the long struggle of a whole year with the Azerbaijan Government, the connected collapse of the Kurdish Independence Movement and the discomfiture of the Tudeh reported from various parts of the country. So far the Government’s forces have behaved in an exemplary manner and. far from indulging in recrimination or revenge, have actually intervened with force to save the Democrats and Fidais from the fury of the mob. Internal Security 3. The North-West Front described, as far as possible, from west to east:—• Sardasht. —The Kurdish forces facing the Persian army have fled and the Kurdish Independence Movement is said to have collapsed. A column is advancing on Mahabad (the Kurdish headquarters) by the direct road from Sardasht. Mulla Mustafa Barzani and his followers and the deserter officers of the Iraqi army are there and have sent a letter to General Humayuni, the G.O.C., Kurdistan, now on his way thither, to say they await his orders as to their future. The Chief of the General Staff has instructed General Humayuni to disarm them as the first step. Bukan&lt; —A Persian army column, advancing from Saqqiz, has reached this place and will go on to Mahabad. Miandoab. —After some fighting in and around Shahin Dezh, in which an Armenian battalion of the rebel forces put up strong resistance, General Humayuni has reached Miandoab, where he received the surrender of Qazi Muhammad, Haji Baba Sheikh and some other Kurdish chiefs. He left Miandoab for Mahabad on 15th December. Maragheh. —’This important town has been reoccupied by detachments moving southwards from Tabriz and northwards from Miandoab. Tabriz. —The Government forces entered Tabriz on 13th December and were given an enthusiastic reception. The town was quiet except in one area, where 200 rebels had barricaded themselves in two houses and were resisting. They were composed of Persian army deserter officers and some of the more desperate “ Fidais.” Mopping up ceased at dawn on 15th December when they surrendered. Most of the leaders of 85-322 4 the Azerbaijan movement have fled, including Pishevari and Ghulam Yahya. Kabiri has been arrested. Birya eluded capture by taking refuge in the Soviet hospital. Dr. Jawid, the Governor-General, and Shabistari, the president of the Pro vincial Council, remained at their posts. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that a steady stream of lorries (120 according to the Chief of the General Staff), carrying Muhajirs (Caucasian immigrants), their arms and belongings, has been seen leaving Tabriz by the Julfa road. A column of one battalion strength left Tabriz on 15th December for Julfa to occupy the frontier post. Another column, of approximately a brigade, is leaving Tabriz on 17th December for Rezaieh. Sarah .—This place was occupied on 15th December by a column from Mianeh. The same column is expected to reach Ardebil on 16th December. Astara .—This place was occupied on 14th December, the strong Democrat garrison fleeing across the bridge into Russian territory. Mazanderan 4. Reference paragraph 8 of last Intelligence Summary, a search of the houses of some suspects in Shahi has unearthed 250 rifles, some dynamite and five hand grenades. In Chalus, a former Tudeh stronghold, arms and a transmitting set have been discovered. Appointments A. —Civil 5. —(i) Ali Ashgar Itisam to be Governor of Kashan.

Moscow radio, quoting the Persian newspaper Zafar (organ of the Workers Union and now suppressed) announced that the American Government had given forty four-engined bombers to the Persian air force. The State Department subsequently issued an official denial of this. Afghan Interests 7. Tehran radio announced on 12th December that the Persian Government had given their agrement to the appoint ment of Muhammad Rahimullah Khan, at present Minister of Mines, as Afghan Ambassador to Persia. Iraqi Interests 8 . According to Seyyid Ahmad Ibn Taher. a Kurd who recently crossed the frontier into Iraq and surrendered to the Iraqi authorities, Mulla Mustafa Barzani and the Iraqi army deserter officers are now serving with the Persian army. The Iraqi Government, in consequence, has instructed its charge d’affaires in Tehran to urge the Persian Government to arrest these persons and hand them over to the Iraqi Government. According to the Persian Chief of the General Staff the above statement is untrue and Mulla Mustafa and the Iraqi deserters are in Mahabad, whence they have sent a letter to the G.O.C., Kurdistan, now on his way thither, offering their submission and saying that they await his orders for their future.spjpi THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT SECRET E 17/17/34 MAJESTY’S GOYERNM V X l 1 / PE ? January 1 fA PERSIA January 1, 1947 Section 1 Copy No. 137 MILITARY ATTACHE’S INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY No. 50, PERSIA Period 16th-22nd December, 1946 {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 515 of 'l^th December; Received 1st January) Persian Affairs Political Preparations for the forthcoming elec tions have been intensified and, in a broad cast from Tehran radio on 18th December, the Persian Prime Minister, after declar ing that Government would not interfere in the elections in any way except to ensure that order was maintained, stated that the electoral committees would be formed throughout the country on 22nd December. Thereafter, the necessary preliminaries would be speedily completed so that polling and the return of candidates could be speedily carried out without delay. The elections in Azerbaijan may be postponed till the situation returns to normal and the civil officials can take up their posts and replace the military governorship tempo rarily established. 2. The Central Committee of the Tudeh Party have published a broadsheet contain ing a manifesto on recent events. It is to the effect that, the Azerbaijan question having been settled, the situation is being exploited by the enemies of freedom to mislead the people and to deprive them of their liberty. If free elections were held the Tudeh Party would win all the seats and that is why an attempt is being made to destroy the party by executions and arrests and by martial law in industrial areas. Government pressure is depriving the Tudeh Party of its electoral rights. Freedom of association is denied and the Tudeh Party cannot therefore take part in the elections. Supported officially by the Government another party will obtain an overwhelming majority. Though Qawam- us-Saltaneh will naturally use his prestige and his present popularity to secure the election of members of his own party, the Tudeh contention, as stated above, is not based on fact. Their rapacity and dis honesty while in office and the gangster methods which they employed to intimidate their political opponents have left such a nasty taste in the mouths of Persians that it is very doubtful if they would secure a single seat in the next elections even if the Prime Minister’s party was not in existence. 3. The Shah has addressed to the Prime Minister a letter of appreciation for his recent services in the settlement of the Azerbaijan question. Internal Security Kurdistan, Azerbaijan and GUan. 4 . The reoccupation of the garrison towns and frontier posts is almost com pleted and the situation is rapidly return ing to normal. Military governorship has been established as a temporary measure throughout the area. From an operational point of view the whole area is divided into three zones, viz., the south, under General Humayuni, the General Officer Commanding, Kurdistan, with his head quarters at Miandoab; the centre and west and north, under Brigadier-General Hashemi, with his headquarters at Tabriz; and the eastern portion, under Colonel Muqboli, with his headquarters at Astara. At this latter place the Persian army has been obliged to maintain two battalions to keep an eye on the 1.200 Democrat rebels who, after putting up a fierce resistance, burnt the town and retreated into Soviet territory by crossing the rivulet on the frontier a hundred yards away. 5. A Persian army cavalry brigade is now carrying out a flag march round Lake Urumiyeh. 6 . According to the Chief of the General Staff the entire stock of the Democrat rebels’ arms has not yet been counted, but in Tabriz alone the haul amounted to 8.000 rifles (Persian army pattern), 3 million rounds S.A.A., 400 light machine guns of German make (yet to+ie confirmed), 200 light and 50 heavy machine guns of Persian army pattern,- (These last two items were from those lost by the Persian garrisons when they surrendered last year.) 7. Mulla Mustafa Barzani and some of the Iraqi army deserter officers are still in 85-31Mahabad, but his followers (of whose num bers estimates range from 1,000 to 2 , 000 ), with three field-guns, are at Naqadeh, some 40 miles north-west. Mulla Mustafa, according to a report received by the Chief of the General Staff from General Humayuni, has asked that officer to procure for him either a pardon from the Iraqi Government or, failing that, permission to reside in Persia at any place ordained by the Persian Government. This is now under consideration by the Persian Government. To attempt to arrest him and to disarm his followers now might, according to the Chief of the General Staff, precipitate a conflict in an area which will be difficult enough to pacify with the forces at his disposal. The collapse of the Kur dish Independence Movement, the cessation of support by the Russians, and the coming of winter will do far more to weaken Mulla Mustafa’s position and to render his large band of followers too severe a drain on the hospitality of the local Kurds. 8 . Some 300 former Democrats are under arrest and awaiting trial in Tabriz. Russian inspired reports (see paragraph 17 below) of the large massacres of the Demo crats before the arrival of the troops were grossly exaggerated and their allegations of wholesale slaughter by the troops after their arrival were unfounded. Fars 9. The Persian Government’s recent successes in Azerbaijan have produced a reaction in Shiraz where the Qashgai are now considering the advisability of con tinuing w r ith their Fars National Move ment. The Prime Minister has suggested that it be merged in his Persian Democrat Party. Most of the other tribal leaders are said to be suspicious of Qashgai motives and to consider that they have been left high and dry by the Qashgai’s recent negotiations with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, for his part, seems to feel strong enough to object to some of the Qashgai nominees for the next elections. If, as the Shah recently stated to the British Military Attache, he had told Muhammad Husein Qashgai that the dis arming of the tribes of the south would be the Persian Government’s next task, the Qashgai may well be feeling nervous about the future. Mazanderan 10. A military court has gone to Mazanderan to try those arrested in con nexion with the disorders reported in para graph 4 of last Intelligence Summary. According to some rather highly coloured press accounts, the authorities have dis covered an extensive plot to blow up road and rail bridges in the Shahi area. Kermanshah 0 11. His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman shah reports an act of rowdyism on 15th December when some members of the Iran Democrat Party broke up the premises of the Tudeh Club. Persian Army 12. Two courts-martial, one in Tabriz and one in Miandoab, are sitting to try Persian deserter officers who have sur rendered. The charge, originally one of desertion, has been altered to one of bearing arms against the State. 13. On 21st December a memorial service in the Sipah Salar Mosque, attended by the Shah, was held to commemorate those who were killed during the past year in Azerbaijan. 14. On 22nd December a victory parade was held in the main square of Tehran to celebrate the reoccupation of Azerbaijan. Many laudatory articles concerning the Persian army have also appeared in the Persian press. Lest it should be thought that a great fuss is being made of nothing or that the Persian army is blowing its tin trumpet too loud, it must be remem bered that a good deal was needed to raise its morale above the dangerously low pitch to which it had sunk. Its sudden collapse and the shameful flight of its officers (not of its rank and file) during the “ events of Shahrivar of 1941,” its disastrous defeat at the hands of the tribesmen at Somirum in 1943, the mutinies of 1945 and its ignominious rebuff by the Russian forces near Qazvin in the same year, all reacted adversely on its spirit and these recent efforts to celebrate its success after so many resounding defeats appear justified. The Court 15. Her Royal Highness Princess Ash- raf, representing His Imperial Majesty the Shah, visited Zenjan and Mianeh during the past week to see for herself the plight to which the wretched inhabi tants have been reduced by the Azerbaijan Democrats during their year of occupation.

The Soviet press, on 13th December, reported briefly the surrender of the Azer baijan Democrats, but it was not till 19th December that Soviet reactions, in the shape of further news and comment in Pravda and Izvestiya and other papers, became known. Tass special correspondent at Tabriz and the Tehran newspaper Dad are quoted as saying that whereas Qiawam-us-Saltaneh had declared that his troops would enter Azerbaijan solely to maintain order during the elections, they had. in fact, created disorder. “ Persecu tion of democratic elements had begun and hundreds of people had been arrested and shot in Tabriz alone.” According to the Chief of the General Staff about 300 “ Muhajirs ” had been killed in the interval between the collapse of the Azer baijan movement and the arrival of the Government forces. These “ Muhajirs ” had paid the penalty for their acts of oppression at the hands of the exasperated populace. Since the entry of the troops, according to the Chief of the General Staff, order had been restored and the troops had intervened to prevent further massacres and destruction of property.
