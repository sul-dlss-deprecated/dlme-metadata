Visits of Vice-Consul, Bushire, to the Arab $oast. s)l' *• PZ I am directed to refer to the India Office letter No. P.Z.4860/39, dated the 5th September 1939, and enclosure, in which it has been suggested by the Foreign Office, London, that as Mr. John, an officer of the Indian Political Service, receives his emoluments from the Government of India the claims preferred on account of his travelling expenses incurred on his visit to the Arab coast should be examined and paid for under the Indian regulations. 2. I am to point out that Mr. John was appointed with effect from the 21st February 1939 as Vice-Consul, Bushire, a post borne on the Levant Service of His Majesty's Government, and that so long as he is solely employed in that post it lias been proposed that his pay and allowances should be debited, with the usual contributions, to His Majesty's Government. In this connection a reference is invited to the Government of India letter No.F.21(6)-S/39 dated the 15th November 1939 to the India Office. If the proposal is agreed to Mr. John will receive his amoluments from His Majesty's Government, and his travelling expenses for his visit to the Arab coast in June 1939 should therefore, it is suggested, be paid under the Foreign Office regulations and a moiety recovered from India in the annual adjustment/28th June, 1939. p.2. 156 l 1940 Received from Mr. R.S.T.

The In view of the absence of sanction for the spending of funds for the tour, I have this year not allowed the Vice-Consul to travel, furthermore, even if funds had been available, I could not have sanctioned the Vice-Consul’s tour owing to the fact that ray Vice-Consul here, Mr. Shaw, was posted to China in April last, without being replaced.

Please see Colonel Powle's despatch of 18th February to the Minister at Tehran on the subject of the coordination of commercial intelligence in the Persian Gulf. The proposal is briefly that a commercial intelligence centre should be established at Bushire, the Levant Vice-Consul attached to the Residency acting as an adviser to the Political Hesiuent on commercial matters covering the Gulf as a whole, in the light, incidentally, of personal visits to Koweit, Bahrein and Mi scat, etc. in order to study commercial c onditions on the spot with the assistance of the local political officers, a brief Persian Gulf commercial review would be produced at short regular intervals. The Vice-Consul’s position would remain unchanged ana he would still be under the control of the Consul-General, Bushire. 2. Ivlr. Hoare has supported this proposal, for which, grima facie , particularly at a time when British trade in the Gulf is exposed to vigorous Russian competition, there seems a great deal to be said. It has equally the strong support of the Department of Overseas Trade wh^f however, raises the connected question of the channel of correspondence. The Department now suggest that they might be allowed to correspond direct with the Resident on commercial matters, a copy of all correspondence being sent to the India Oflice ana Colonial Office for information, labile I do not think that the present system is responsible for any delay ? there seems no great harm in a procedure such as that proposed, subject to the important proviso that the political departments concerned/2 concerned shall he consulted In the first instance on any commercial questions which may have a political aspect.

It will be recollected that the question of the method of correspondence between the Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade and the Political v Resident in the Persian Gulf formed the subject of correspondence between the Department of Overseas Trade, the Colonial Office and the India Office in 1925 , terminating in P. India Office letter to the Colonial Office Ro. 484 / 2 ^ of 24 th February,I 925 • It was stated in that letter that the Comptroller-General would communicate with the Political Resident on matters relating to the Arabian side of the Gulf only through the medium of the India Office, or in cases where wide political issues or questions affecting oil were concern ed, through the Colonial Office. Colonel Fowle ! s proposal envisages a greater volume of correspondence on commercial matters than has hitherto been the case, and Colonel Colville feels that the logical and most satisfactory method of con ducting correspondence in the future would be for the Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade to correspond direct with the Political Resident on commercial matters, sending a copy to the India Office and Colonial Office for information. On/-3- On the ground that speed is the essence of successful commercial intelligence work Colonel Colville therefore — expresses the further hope that Sir Samuel Hoare will authorise such direct correspondence in future, provided that copies of all despatches addressed to and received from the Political Resident are sent simultaneously to the India Office and Colonial Office and subject to the further proviso that the India Office and Colonial Office would be consulted in the first instance on such commercial questions as may have a political aspect.

Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a despatch from the Political Resident and Consul-General at Bushire suggesting certain steps which might be taken for the co-ordination of commercial intelligence in the Persian Gulf. 2 . I am entirely in favour of the scheme propounded and I have no objection to the Vice-Consul at Bushire undertaking the additional duties that it entails. If the Department considers that one hundred pounds is a larger annual sum than the prospects of increased trade with the Arab Coast warrant, I venture to suggest that fifty pounds a year might be sanctioned experimentally, enough, that is, for one visit to each of the three main Arab ports of Kuwait, Bahrein and Muscat. No fresh provision will have to be made until the ninety four pounds which is already available has been expended. 3 . If the scheme is accepted in principle, Lieutenant Powle might be authorised to pay for one triple tour during the next financial year out of the ninety four pounds at his dis posal and if experience shows that the results are of value or that the scheme cannot be worked satisfactorily on less than two triple tours a year, the question of an increased grant could be considered. 4 . I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the Foreign Office (No.P.L.132), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No.62), and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire(No.43)* 1 have the honour to be with the highest respect.

Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, , ’ (Signed) R.H.Hoarei ’ - i y * ■ 4 , T ^ R.B. •4 vm.wm KO. 20/387 Of 1933 . British Residency and Consulate-General. Bushire, the l8th February,1933• Subject: Commercial Intelligence Centre at Bushire. Sir I have the honour to make the following proposal which I trust will meet with your approval. 2* The present arrangements for commercial intelligence in the Persian Gulf are as follows:- On the Persian side the Consul at Bandar Abbas, the Vice Consul, Bushire, (under the immediate superintendence of the Political Resident in his capacity of Consul-General, Bushire), the Vice-Consul, Mohammerah, (under the immediate superintendence of Consul, Ahwaz), deal with the commercial intelligence under the general superintendence of the Commercial Attachfe to the Legation at Tehran. On the Arab side the Political Agents at Kuwait, Bahrain, and Muscat, deal with commercial matters under the superintenaence of the Political Resident. 3 . It will be seen therefore that while Doth sides of the Gulf are adequately dealt with by the various officers concerned, in spite of the fact that the Gulf is a commercial entity there is no one office whose business it is to collect and co-ordinate commercial intelligence for this entity, and to give a picture of it as a whole . 4 . My proposal briefly is that this co-ordination might be done at Bushire by the Vice-Consul under the superintendence - for the Persian side - of the Consul-General, Bushire, and the Commercial Attach*, and - for the Arabian side - under the super intendence of the Consul-General in his capacity of Political Resident. In this way a small but useful commercial intelligence centre could be established at Bushire. With regard to the Arabian side. In order to put the proposal into ,effect it would be necessary for the Vice-Consul to pay brief visits to Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat, in order to study commercial conditions on the spot, where of course he would have the assistance of the local Political Officers. In this connection the following is an extract from a despatch No .34 of 3 rd Jun*,193 1 from the late Sir Hugh Biscoe to the India Office on the subject of the preparation of reports for the Department of Overseas Trade on the Arab side of the Gulf:- 'On my recent tour I was further enabled through the courtesy of His Majesty 1 s Minister to take with me Mr.Vice- Consul Blanch, to whom I am greatly indebted for the com pilation of the attached memorandum, collection of samples, etc. He deals with all commercial matters in my office, and I am confident that if His Majesty 1 s Vice-Consul at Bushire is enabled to visit the Arab Coast in my company once or twice a year, it will be of great assistance to myself and the local officers and ultimately I hope of benefit to British Trade'.- 2 - On the tour in question Sir Hugh Biscoe had a hired vessel at his disposal which went from port to port, and so was able to take Mr. Blanch with him at no extra cost to Government. The present arrangement for my tour are that I travel by mail or sloop, or a combination of both. The Vice-Consul would, therefore, have to pay his fares on the mail, though I should of course be pleased to take him with me on a sloop, if accommodation could be found for him, and if our times of tour happened to coincide. The return fares from Bushire to the States concerned are as follows:- Bushire to Kuwait Rs. 76-rO-O. Bushire to Bahrain Rs. 108.0-0. Busgire to Muscat Rs. 27 O-O-O. Halting allowance for a week 1 s halt in each State, between mails, at Rs.lO/- per diem (the allowance under the Government of India regulations for the touring of the Consul here) would come to Rs. 210, or a total of Rs. 664 /-, say £^0, or £100 for two tours, and I suggest that if you approve. His Majesty* s Government might be approached with a view to granting this small sum(£ 100 ) per annum. 5 . I would suggest that my proposal might be considered as experimental for the first year at the conclusion of which a decision could be taken as to whether the Vice-consul should continue his commercial tours of the Arab side or not. In order to meet the cost during this first year a sum of £94 is available so that no additional expense would fall on His Majesty*s Government for the first twelve months. The funds in question represent fees retained, with the permission of the Government of Iraq, for services rendered on their account by this office between 1922 and 1927* As Foreign Office in their despatch No.7(T877 0 /l848/378) ^ 14th August 1929 declined to allow the re tention of any part of this sum by the Vice-Consul I suggest that it could now be usefully applied to defray the initial cost of the present proposal. 6 . The formation of a commercial intelligence centre at Bushire will have the following advantages. The Vice-Consul would be able to act as an adviser to the Political Resident on commercial matters covering the Gulf as a whole. Enquiries from the Department of Overseas Trade could be answered direct from Bushire, where the information would generally be on record, and it would be much easier to give that Department a complete * picture* of the Gulf from the commercial point of view than at present. Commercial activity all over the Gulf would be much easier to co ordinate. Finally, once a quarter, or once every six months, or once a year - whichever would be most useful, the Vice-Consul could produce a brief Persian Gulf Commercial Review. In addition to commercial intelligence the Vice-Consul, on his tours, would be able to discuss passport control and visa regulations as applied on the Arab side, and the information gained would be most useful for the better working of this complicated subject. 7 . In conclusion I should like to emphasise that the Vice-Consul*s position would be in no way altered by my proposal. He would still work under the Consul-ceneral, Bushire, and the Legation, for the Persian side, as at present. Nor would his absences on tour interfere with his routine work here. He could adopt the same procedure as I do on my tours, that is to say, visit a post on the Arabian side and return by the next mail, get level with his office work here, and at the next convenient opportunity visit the next post. I have talked the matter over with Mr.Baillie, the present Vice-Consul here, and he is only too willing/willing to undertake the work indicated, I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India.

In reply to Sir John : huckburph's letter number 73/1924/25 of January 10th relntivo to the method of conduotinp correspondenoe vdth Colonel Prideaux, I am directed by Mr. Arthur richael Samuel to state that his attention has now been called to the terms of Mr. J.H. Thomas' despatch ro.13 of April 15th 1924 (16327/24), of which no copy appears to have been sent to the Department of Overseas Trade. / 2. Mr. Secretary Amery is now in possession of the information requested in paragraph 2 of Sir John Shuckburgh's letter under reply. 3 . /a regards enouiries upon matters relating to Colonel Prideaux's capacity js Political Resident at Bushire, Mr. Samuel proposes to address himself to the Secretary of State for India or the Secretary of State for the Colonies according to the nature of the subject. The need for a means of direct correspondence v/ith Colonel rideaux in that capacity does not therefore arise. 4. It remains to consider the question of correspondence with Colonel 'rideaux in his capecity as His Majesty's Consul General. 5. It is assumed, in the absence of a copy of the instructions sent to Colonel Prideaux, that those instructions apply only to him in his capacity as Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, since Colonel Prideaux is also Consul-General for the provinces of '^ars, khuzistan, Laristan and the The Under-Secretary of Stf te. Colonial Office, LONDON, S.”.l. district/^ (Tf^ - 2 - Z_ district of T.ingah, and in this respect is a member of the consular corps and as such receives the direct instructions of the Secretary of State for T 'oreipn Affairs. 6 . As Mr. Arthur Michael Samuel is not only arliamentary Under Secretary of State to the oreipn Office but is the head of the Consular fervice, he is therefore sure that Mr. Amery will a^ree that correspondence between the department and Colonel Jrideaux shall be direct when addressed to him as Consul-General and not as Political Hesident and Mr. Samuel would be plad to receive a specific assurance that the instructions forwarded to Colonel .Prideaux do not traverse this principle. 7. /a regards matters which may arise relating to what may be termed the Arabian capacity of Colonel rideaux, Mr. Samuel will be guided by the division of his functions between the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for the Colonies as laid down in Mr. Thomas* despatch No.13 of April 15th 1924. 8 . I am also to state that it is realised that Bahrein does not fall within Colonel rideaux*s jurisdiction in his capacity as Consul-General and no requests will in future be addressed to him by the Department of Overseas Trade for information regarding these islands, but to the Colohial Office or India Office. Nor v/ould any such request have been addressed to him in this instance if the matter had not been raised by His Majesty's legation at Teheran. Copies of this correspondence have been sent to the India Office, the foreign Office, and to His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran.

I am accordingly to request that in future despatches from your Department may be addressed to the British Resident at Bushire under flying seal through the Colonial Office in accordance with the same arrangement that prevails in regard to correspondence between your Department and the High Commissioners for Iraq and Palestine.

Eastern and General Syndicate have entered into contract v/ith Bahrein Government to bore two artesian wells within the limits of two towns for water supply. They have already received Rupees 50,000 being half the agreed price of boring casing and equipping these two wells. These towns are located on the opposite side of the island from the oil indications and bores are limited to depth of 600 feet each. Holmes states that his business at Bahrein is purely connected with these two wells. He has no intention of discussing oil concession or drilling for oil.

The apparatus, Major Daly understands, is being Supplied by a British firm of Artesian well experts, who are also supplying the boring personnel.

Secretary IlacDonald, copy of the papers noted belov/, on the subject of the definition of the respective spheres of responsibility of the Colonial Office and the Government of mdia in ^ejd, iCoweit, Bahrein, and the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf generally. I am. Sir, Your most obedient Servamt, J.E. MAST3RT0U SMITH. The Under Secretary of State, Poreign Office. Date Description 15th April. Despatch Do.13 to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.4 DOLING STREET, Ho.13. Sir, P 37 n h v a 15th April, 1924. I have the honour to refer to the Duke of Devonshire T s despatch of the 12th of June Ho.l and subsequent correspondence regarding the conduct of relations with Nejd, Xoweit, Bahrein and the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf generally, and to inform you that it has recently been represented to me that the lack of a clear definition of the respective spheres of responsibility of the Colonial Office and the Government of India in those areas might give rise to misunderstanding on your part and might not unreasonably leave you in some doubt as to the responsible authority to whom you should report on any given subject. The possibility of drawing a somewhat clearer line of division between the interests of the Colonial Office and the Government of India in the areas in question has consequently been considered in consultation with the India Office and the arrangement outlined in the succeeding paragraphs of this despatch has been concurred in by the Secretary of State for India. 2. The Interdepartmental Committee set up in 1921 by the late Government to make recommendations as to the formation of a new Department under the Colonial Office to deal with Mandated and other Territories in the Middle East recommended that 'the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf should remain under the control of the Political Resident THE POLITICAL RESIDENT, in/ PERSIAN GULP.in the Persian Gulf; that this officer should be appointed as at present by the Government of India, but should be authorised to communicate direct with the Colonial O^ice on matters concerning the Arabian littoral; onat uhe functions of the Government of India in respect of uhe Arabian littoral should be confined to administrative and purely local matters, and that the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office should be obtained by them to any measures of political significance; and lastly that the relations of His Majesty’s Government with Ibn Saud should be conducted exclusively by the new Department through the Political Resident at Bushire in the first place. It may also be desirable to provide that the Political Agent at Bahrein, we understand to be the official in direco toucn with ibn Saud, should in cases of urgency be communicated with direct by the new Department'. 3, His Majesty’s Government approved generally the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee subject to two provisos, one of which was, that the approval c~ uhe Government of India should be obtained, she Government 0 -_ India have not yet reached a final decision upon the proposals of the Coimnittee, but on being consulted they agreed that the arrangements outlined in the Duke of Devonshire’s despatch under reference, which was directly based upon those proposals, should provisionally be adopted. 4. The statement made in the first paragraph of the letter from the India Office of the 29th of May, a copy of which accompanied the Duke of Devonshire’s despatch, to the effect that the Colonial Office should address the Political Resident direct in regard to Hejd and Koweit affairs is possible/- 3 - // possibly a little misleading. The Colonial Office are not directly concerned with the local affairs of Kov/eit whether political or Administrative, nor, indeed with those of any other Arabian States bordering upon the Persian Gulf except in so far as these may re-act upon Arabian politics in general or upon His Majesty’s Government's relations with Ibn Saud in particular. Consequently in all matters which relate solely to the internal administration and politics of these areas and which are unlikely to have external repercussions, you should regard the Government of India as the responsible authority to whom you should report and from whom you should seek instructions. Upon such matters I should however, be glad if you would keep me informed, in order that should any question v/hich in its initial stages was one of purely local interest later become one of external importance and likely to have reactions upon territories or political relations which are primarily the concern of this Department, I may not, when the matter is ultimately referred to me for instructions, be ignorant of its earlier developments. You should also keep the Government of India similarly informed of any action which you may take upon my instructions in regard to matters directly or indirectly affecting territories under the control of the Colonial Office. 5. To draw a hard and fast distinction between matters of local and matters of external interest would be extremely difficult if not impossible, and I must leave it to your discretion as and v/hen cases arise to decide to whom you should apply for instructions. Doubtless many border-line cases will arise, involving both local and external interests and in such cases you should refer the facts both to the Government/Government of India and to this Department, when the necessary action to he taken will he concerted and instructions will be issued to you accordingly. 6. Questions of this nature are best illustrated by a concrete example, and to this end I would invite reference to the recent measures taken for the re-organisation of the Koweit Customs originally proposed in your despatch of the 20th of June Do.298S. In so far as these measures are directed to the improvement of the revenues of Koweit and of the local machinery of Government, I do not regard myself as dir ectly concerned: but the further ob;ject which is in view - the settlement of the outstanding customs disputes between Eoweit and Nejd - I regard as the direct concern of this Department and I should be glad if you would continue to consult me on this aspect of the matter. 7. There is in addition one subject, that of the development of the oil resources of the Arabian littoral, to which no reference has been made above. For various reasons His Majesty’s Government have decided that the question of the grant of oil concessions in those territories cannot conveniently be separated from the cognate question of the grant of similar concessions in Iraq, Nejd, Palestine, etc., and that the development of the oil resources of those areas of .the Middle East which are subject to the influence of His Majesty’s Government must be considered as a whole. Consequently I shall be glad if you will continue to address me on this subject as heretofore. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) J.H.
