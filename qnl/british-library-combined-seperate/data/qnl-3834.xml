The majority of the correspondence is between the two banks, Belgrave, the Political Agent in Bahrain, and the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf.The papers consist of covering letters, receipts, accounts, and letters of acknowledgement connected to regular payments made into the account. Also included is correspondence concerning investment in loans and a discussion over what securities offer better value. The papers suggest that by July 1931 the account was transferred to the Eastern Bank.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Lloyds Bank</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Charles Dalrymple Belgrave</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Trust funds</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000380#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000380#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000380#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
