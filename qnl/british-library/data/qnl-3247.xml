(3) w—unwiiHUWBIWIHIHHIIHWMHHiWBt^W^HBBB No. 38384/1925. Sir, x am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknow- -ledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th of August notifying your acceptance of the appointment of British Representative for the purpose of negotiating with the Sultan oi Nejd a settlement of outstanding frontier and other questions, and to communicate to you for your guidance the following information regarding the policy of His Majesty f s Government in the matters which are likely to be raised in the course of jrhur conversations with Ibn Saud. of 1923 to settle/ by agreement the various matters in dispute between Ibn Saud and the rulers of the neighbouring Arab states, and for this purpose a Conference of represent- -atives of the States concerned assembled at Kuwait in records of the proceedings of that Conference are enclosed £ herewith for your information together with a file contain- -ing copies of relevant correspondence with Lieutenant agreement was then made, but for various reasons which are apparent from the records, the Conference closed without which the Kuwait Conference was called were (1) The delimitation of the frontier between Nejd and Trans-Jordan: (2) The prevention of trans-frontier raiding between the tribes of Iraq and Nejd and the settlement of claims arising from past raids; As you are aware, an attempt was made at the end December of that year under the Presidency of Lieutenant colonel S. G. Knox, C.S.I., C.I.E.* Copies of the Colonel Knox. A certain measure of progress towards achieving any definite result. The main objects for(3) The settlement of frontier and other disputes between Nejd and the Hejaz. Since that Conference terminated many events have occurred which have considerably modified the situation in Arabia. A brietff record of 'fc tag r these events will be found in the Appendix to the report of the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which a copy 4s enclosed herewith. Chief among these events was the outbreak of hostilities between the Sultan of Eejd and the King of the Hejaz. Hostilities are still proceeding, and although the final issue cannot be foreseen the present position is that the xorces of Xbn Saud are in effective occupation of the greater part of the Hejaz, including the Holy City of Mecca, and are investing the town of Jeddah, upon which and the immediately surrounding country King Ali maintains a precarious hold. The Northern districts of the Hejaz, bordering upon Trans-Jordan, are not at present in the effective occupation of either of the combatants. As you are aware, His Majesty*s Government have publicly announced their strict neutrality in this conflict. 3. Although the situation in Arabia has been very considerably modified during the last two years, the three principal questions with which the Kuwait Conference was concerned remain** unsettled today, and it is with the primary object of disposing of the first two of these questions that the negotiations, in which you are to xj* represent His Maje3ty*s Government, have been initiated. As regards the first question, that of the delimitation of the frontier between Trans-Jordan and Nejd, I am to enclose, for your information, a copy of the instructions communicated to LieutenaMt Colonel Khox prior to the assembly of the Kuwait Conference. You will see that at that time His Majesty*s Government were prepared to accept as a minimum an eastern frontier which would roughly follow a line drawn from the intersection of meridian 39° with parallel 32° to the intersection5. ■''■■■■■■FTHrniroffli intersection of meridian 37° with parallel 31° 30*. From this point the line follows meridian 37° to parallel 31°, thence to the intersection of me/ridian 38° with parallel 30°, and thence along meridian 38° to parallel 29 a 35*, or a point due west of the hefud salient. The frontier is indicated hy a red line on the attached map. Since this frontier was decided upon the military advisers of His Majesty’s Government have represented the importance , for xX’KXgKKX&amp;.x strategical reason of including in Trans Jordan the village of Kaf. His Majesty's Government are now satisfied of the desirability of this and you should use your utmost endeavours to secure the acceptance by Ibn Saud of a frontier substantially identical with that indicated abdve, but including Kaf within Trans-Jordan territory. 4. From the telegram from Lieutenant Colonel Xnox, a copy of which is appended, it appears likely that Ibn Saud will advance a claim to a frontier considerably to the west of the above line and extending to the nofcth of the isidbK Jebel Anaizeh. This frontier claim is indicated by a green line on the attached map. Such a frontier would involve the inter-position of Hejd territory between Iraq and Trans-Jordan and would place Ibn Saud astride the Imperial Air Route to the East. This cannot be permitted and in no circumstances should you assent to any extension of Nejd territory to the north which would have the effect of separating Iraq from Trans-Jordan. You will observe from the enclosed copy of the Iraq-Nejd frontier agreement, with attached map, that the western extremity of this fronti -er is the intersection of meridian 39°N with parallel 32°E. The Eastern frontier of Trans-Jordan should in the opinion of His Majesty's Government start from this point and be drawn rather in a westerly or southerly direction than in a northerly.5. In the southern sector of the eastern frontier of Trans Jordan Ibn Saud’s claim appears equally objectionable since, in His Majesty’s Government’s opinion, any more out endangering the safety of the Trans-Jordan section of northern and southern extremities of the frontier line originally proposed by His Majesty’s Government as fixed, and it would be advisable to make this clear to Ibn Saud at -le to induce Ibn Saud to agree to the inclusion of Kaf with -in Trans-Jordan and if, in your opinion, further insistence on this point would be mseiess, you may in the last resort concede that village to Nejd, in which case the frontier should approximately follow the line indicated in red on the attached map. You will observe that Ibn Saud desires the inclusion 4n Nejd of a tract of territory to the South of Kaf comprising the four streams running eastward into the Wadi Sirhan, viz. the Wadis Bayet, Gharra, Hasa and Hedrid. His Majesty’s Government are not aware to what extent this area is essential as a grazing ground to the tribes depend ing on Trans-Jordan and Syria, or whether it contains a settled population. Enquiries are being made of the High Commissioner for Palestine and steps will be taken to fur- -nlsh you with precise information on these points. From the telegram from Sir P. Cox dated the 6th of December 1922, of which a copy is enclosed, it will be seen at that time Ibn Saud would have accepted a frontier roughly following the western edge of the Wadi Sirhan and leaving the greater part of this area within Trans-Jordan. -vances a claim to any territory in this region additional to that claimed in 1922 and should endeavour to resist such a claim on the ground that this territory was clearly not westerly trace / than that proposed could not be adopted with the Hejaz Railway. You should, therefore, regard the the outset of your discussions. If however you are unab You should point this out to Ibn Saud if he ad regarded7. 5 regarded as essential to Hejd in 1922 and His Majesty's Government are aware of no valid reason why it should be so regarded now. if however Ibn Saud presses his claim to this tract of territory very strongly and it appears that unless he receives some measure of ax satisfaction the negotiations will break down, His Majesty's Government would, as at present advised, be prepared to agree to some arrangement whereby this territory would be constituted a neutral enclave ( on the analogy of the section of neutral territory on the southern frontier between Nejd and Iraq ), which the tribes of both parties would be free to enter tfor grazing purposes. His Majesty’s Government are content to leave it to your discretion, in the light of the inform- -ation which you will receive from the High Commissioner foi Palestine, to decide whether such an arrangement would be feasible and, if so, to work out details in agreement with Ibn Saud. I 6. The question of the southern frontier of Trans- -Jordan is one of some delicacy owing to the unstable con- “ditions obtaining in the Northern districts of the Hejaz, it ^ : t la, as pointed out above, do not at present appear to be within the effective occupation or control of either Ibn Saud or King Ali. Consequently, any attempt to negotiate a frontier with one party would be liable to give offence to the other. In all the circumstances, and in view of the fact that Ibn Saud has already been informed of the Southern limits ol Trans-Jordan territory, His Majesty^ Government consider that it would be advisable in your conversations with him to treat this matter as a chose .jugee , merely informing him, if he should raise the point, that the southern frontier of Trans-Jordan starts from the inter- -section of meridian 38° and parallel 29° Sb*, crosses the li ejaz Railway south of Mudawwara and joins the Gulf of Akaba at a point south of that town.6 % J f A 7. With regard to the second main question with which you will he concerned, that of the prevention of trans-frontier raiding between I#aq ani&amp;ejd tribes, I am to invite your attention to the rewords of the later meetings of the Kuwait Conference, and to the accompanying copy of a Confidential despatch dated the 12th of March 1925 from the High Commissioner for Iraq. From these you will observe that a substantial measure of agreement was reached at Kuwait as to the steps necessary to check such raiding, but that the Conference failed to reach agreement on the important question of the mutual restoration of loot and the payment of compensation in respect of damages arising out of past xxat raids. As regards the arrangements necessary to prevent future raids, the position has been very comfortably eased 1 by the action of the Iraq Government in moving the principal offenders - the refugee Shammar - to districts remote from the Iraq-Nejd frontier, where they will not be subject to the same temptation to raid across the border, and where their activities can be more easily and effectively controlled. Consequently, there appear to be good grounds for hoping that on this question it will be found possible to reach an agreement with Ibn Saud. Such agreement should, in His Majesty*s Government's opin- -ion, xji&amp;aot in general follow the lines of the scheme under consideration by the Kuwait Conference, unless, of course, some alternative and more satisfactory method suggests it- -self in the course of your discussions. Any agreement that may be reached on this point might with advantage be extended mutat is mutandi s to apply to Trans-Jordan. His Majesty’s Government anticipate that the settlement of outstanding claims for compensation and the restoration of loot will present greater difficulties, but you should use your best endeavours to obtain a settlement substantially in accord with the suggestions advanced in Sir H. Dobbs’ despatch7 despatch of the 30th of June, of which a copy is appended to this letter. To assist you in this part of your negotiat- -ions, the Iraq Government have decided to place at your disposal the services of Tawfiq Beg al Suwaidi, Assistant Government Counsellor in the Ministry of Justice. He will he in a position to furnish you with full details regarding claims and counter-claims advanced in respect of past raids, as also with the views of the Iraq Government regarding a finci.1 settlement of such claims. If you are successful in reaching agreement with Ibn Saud with regard to trans- -frontier raiding across the Trans-Jordan or Iraq frontier respectively or the question of the determination of a Trans-Jordan—Nejd frontier, the decisions reached should be embodied in separate formal agreements signed by you and Ibn Saud. Any such agreements, in so far as they concern Iraq, will require to be approved by the Iraq Parliament and ratified by King Feisal before they become operative. In so far as they concern Trans-Jordan they will enter into lorce as from the date of signature and will n6t require ( ratification. 8. Apart from these major questions, there are two other matters which might with advantage be dismissed with Ibn Saud, when a favourable opportunity offers, viz. the protection of Nejdi interests in Syria and the question of British representation in Nejd. As regards the former question I have to explain that in September 1922, Ibn Saud requested His Majesty’s Government to undertake temporarily the protection of Nejdi interests in Syria. His Majesty’s Government agreed to accept this charge and the French authorities, who were informed of Ibn Saud’s request acquiesced in the arrangement. Shortly afterwards, how- -ever, Ibn Saud appointed a representative in Damascus, but when notifying His Majesty’s Consul at Damascus of this appointment, asked him to supervise the work of the Nejdi representativerepresentative, and to give him all advice and assistance of which he might stand in need. Copies of Ibn Baud’s letters are enclosed herewith for yomrinformation. The present Hejdi representative at Bamascus, Suleyman Ibn Musheiqih, unlike his predecessors and possibly with the object of enhancing his own importance locally, has shown himself on more than one occasion impatient of the control of the British Consul, and the Frebch authorities have similarly evinced an increasing reluctance to accept the intervention of the British Consul at Damascus in questions affecting Hejdi interests. Matters recently came to a head when, in April of this year, the British Consul inter- -vcnet with the French authorities on behalf of Nejd and was informed that, as Ibn Saud was already officially represented in Syria the French authorities were ubable to recognise any right on the part of His Majesty’s Consular Officers to assume the protection of Nejdi interests in that country. In order that His Majesty’s Government may have the necessary information to enable them to decide what attitude to adopt towards this action on the part of the French authorities, you should seek a suitable occasion to ascertain and report to His Majesty’s Government what is the precise function of the Hejdi representative at Damascus and what are Ibn Baud’s real wishes regarding the protection of his interests in Syria. 9. The second question - that of permanent or xaxaot semi-permanent British representation in Hejd - is one which has been engaging the attention of His Majesty’s Government for some time. The present arrangement has not proved altogether satisfactory. Written communications between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud pass through the inter: -mediary of the Political Resident in the Persian Quit t 2 tn&amp; but there is at present no representative of His Majesty’s Government9 Government in personal touch with Ibn Saud, and the absence of such a representative has given rise, in the past, to various misunderstandings and disputes, very largely attri- -butable to the lact that His Majesty *3 Government are frequently unaware of Ibn Saud’s real wished or intentions since he is notably averse from committing himself in writing Kis Majesty’s Government feel that many of the disputes whicJ have arisen in the past might have been avoided by x prompt and frank discussion of the questions at issue had this been possible. considered. It has been suggested that the time has now come to station a permanent representative at Ibn Baud’s grounds of the extreme discomfort inseparable from prolonged residence at Riyadh and the dangerously isolated position suggested that a representative of Ibn Saud should be accepted in London or accredited to King Faisal or the British High Commissioner at Baghdad; but as Ibn Saud is known to be unwilling to place £51 reliance upon the judg ement or discretion of his subordinates, such an arrangement would be unlikely to achieve the desired result. Another suggestion which has been advanced is that arrangements should be made for periodical visits to be paid by a British Officer to Ibn Saud. In the existing circumstances, this last suggestion appears the most likely to commend itself to His M a jesty ! s Government, but as circumstances may alter in the near future (e.g. Ibn Saud may, as a result of his conquests in the Hejaz move his capital to some more readily accessible spot) His Majesty’s Government would prefer to reserve their decision until conditions in Arabia become more stable. You should, however, encourage Ibn Saud to discuss this question frankly with you, and, without Various solutions of the difficulty have been capital. This suggestion is open to objection on the which such an Officer v/ould occupy. Again it has been definitelyI / bbbbwwpbhhhbbbb 10 definitely committing His ^jesty’s Government to any of the above alternatives, you should endeavour to ascertain his wishes in the matter. You should point out to Ibn Baud that his Majesty's Government are desirous of making arrangements which would enable them to be kept permanently in touch with him, if circumstances render such a course p^racticable, and both in discussing this matter with Ibn Baud and throughout your discussions with him you should make it clear that His ^ajesty's Government are anxious to be on cordial terms with His Highness and to co-operate wh with him wherever possible. 10. It is not improbable that during your x3sx.*augx conversations Ibn Baud will raise the question of his position in the Hejaz and will endeavour to obtain from you a statement of His Majesty's Government's policy and in particular to learn what view His Majesty's Government take of the recent expansion of his territories and vHiat are their wishes with regard to the future administration of the Hejaz. If Ibn Baud questions you on these points you should confine your reply to a statement that His Majesty's Government's only desire is for the speedy term- -ination of the present hostilities and the re-establishment of peaceful conditions in the Hejaz; their recent offer of mediation was made with this sol4£ object in view and they have learned with regret that Ibn Baud is at present un- -willing to accept it. Their offer has, nov/ever, not been withdrawn, and it is still open to Ibn Baud, should he so desire, to avail himself of their good offices. But while hostilities continue His Majesty's Government have no alternative but to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality. With regard to the ultimate regime to be set up in the Holy Cities and in Hejaz generally, you should point out that, beyond doing everything in their power to ensure that their Moslem subjects have free and safe access to11 to the holy places, His Majesty’s Government feel that they cannot properly intervene in a matter which so closely concerns Moslem opinion as a whole. While confining yourself to a statement on the above lines you should, in no way discourage Ibn Saud from discussing the matter freely with you. 11. Ibn Saud may also represent that the terms of the Treaty concluded with him in 1916, a copy of which is enclos -ed, are no longer appropriate, in view of the recent ex- -tension ot his territories, and may suggest that the Treaty should be replaced by one more in accordance with his in - -creased influence and importance. In this event you should inform him that, while hostilities are actually in progress, His Majesty’s Government clearly cannot enter into negotiations for a new Treaty, and that until peace is restored and stable conditions are establish© -ed His Majesty’s Government would prefer to leave matters as they are. 12. Should Ibn Saud raise other questions which are not covered by these instructions you should take note of what he has to say and report to His Majesty^s Government, at the same time informing him that you are without instruct’ -ions on these points, but that you vail communicate his views to His Majesty’s Government by whom thejr will be given every consideration. 13. I am to inform you that, in accordance with your suggestion, the Palestine Government have agreed to place at your disposal the services of Mr. G. Antonious, to act as your Becretary and have also agreed to attach a British Stenographer to your Mission. A further communication will be addressed to you with regard to the date of your departure, and the venue of the meeting. In the meantime, 5 k I am to request that you will hold yourself in readiness to proceed to Jeddah at short notine. I am, etc. Sd/- R.V.VERMQH.WIPWM——i COPY.

With reference to your suggestion that the meeting should take place at Rabigh, as being removed from the scene of hostilities, I wish I could agree to that, but it is necessary for me to remain in the present position for the moment. The meeting can, however, be held at Rahra or Briman, which are away from the scene of hostilities to the North by about four hours journey, and are near the coast. 1 wish I could have agreed to your porposal as regards Rabigh, but the urgent and termendoua work does not allow of my absence from this position in a place such as Rabigh.

Agreement with Bin Suad regarding Iraq Frontier affairs on line indicated in my instructions was signed on November 1st. Agreement includes all points agreed upon at Kuwait Conference, namely puhishment of raiding tribes and Chiefs ? abstention from direct corr- -espondence with Shaikhs, prohibition of forces from cross- -ing frontier, of Shaikhs from displaying flags. I have also provided for a tribunal consisting of equal number of Nejd and Iraq members and neutral President agreed upon by both sides to sit for fixing of responsibility and assessing s damages resulting from future raids. With regard to point about which no agreement was reached at Kuwait I have succeeding in obtaining Bin Saud’s asssent to undertaking formulated by Colonel Knox at Kuwait by which both Iraq and Hejd bind themselves to discourage migration of tribes from on© country to another (High Commissioner’s despatch Confid- -ential of March 12th 1925 refer). I have also obtained Bin Baud’s assent to a clause whereby tribes called up for military service must take their families and flocks with them. With regard to extradition I resisted Bin Baud’s insistent demand and arranged that ^ii€stion of extradition of non-political offenders should form subject of friendly negotiations between Iraq and Nejd with a view to discussing an extradition treaty on lines usually adopted between neighbouring States. With regarding to restitution of/ loot I was ^re- -cluded from arriving at an actual liquidation chiefly owing to fact that the Iraq delegate was not in possession of the necessary details. Nevertheless I have arranged that liquidationliquidation of claims should be undertaken by tribunal described above or similar tribunal, which should be called within six months of ratification of agreement, and whose decision will be final.

Allium miiiijy ^ ^y-t-viiyjnyjj^jrgijj ^ r\ Copy of a Despatch Secret M A M , dated the 8th December 1925^ from The Acting High Commissioner for ’Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. In continuation of my telegram No. 639, dated the 4th of December 1925, I have the honour to report that Sir Gilbert Clayton arrived in Baghdad on the morning of jfcfeus November the 30th and handed me a copy of his complete report of the Bahra Agjxx&amp;msmi negotiations, together with a signed copy of the Bahra Agreement. I forwarded the latter to the Prime Minister with the request that steps may be taken to secure its ratification at an early date. I also forwarded to him copies of the papers numbered 2, 3 and 4 in Annexure 14 to Sir Gilbert Clayton’s Report, namely Taufiq Beg Suwaidi’s report regarding the conversation between himself and the Najd delegate in connection with the liquidation of past raids, Sir Gilbert Clayton's letter to Ibn Baud on the same subject, and Ibn Baud’s reply .xkxxxx Xjx The only Arabic copies of these documents having been forwarded 'by Sir Gilbert Clayton to the Colonial Office I did not consider it advisable to have them re-translated into Arabic, but forwarded them in English. I should be grateful if I could be favoured, as early as possible, with copies of the Arabic versions that are in your possession. 2. Sir Gilbert Clayton had interviews with His Majesty King Faisal and with the Council of Ministers. Both His Majesty and the Cabinet expressed themselves as thoroughly satisfied with the terms of the Bahra Agreement, and exceedingly grateful for the able manner in which Sir Gilbert Clayton conducted the negotiations on their behalf. Parliament is due to reassemble on December the 20th, and no difficulty is anticipated in securing its approval to the ratification of the agreement by His Majesty.2 3. Th** Agreement is, from the ’Iraq point of view, thoroughly satisfactory, and the ’Iraq Government have every reason to he grateful to Sir Gilbert Clayton for the skilful diplomacy which enabled him to secure a favourable settlement of all the important points which the Kuwait Conference failed to decide« It now depends upon the ’Iraq Government more, I think, than upon Ibfn Saud, to see that the terms of the agreement are loyally s snrgfieBHrigyri observed. The establishment of cordial relations between the ruler of Najd and any son of the ex ▼King of the Hijaz can scarcely be looked for in the immediate future, but 1 see no reason to suppose that His Majesty King Faisal will not subordinate his natural feelings of filial resentment to the tfcue interests of the country over which he rules. The co»operation of the present Cabinet may be safely counted upon. | 3. The first necessity for the implementing of the Bahra Agreement is the establishment of more expeditious means of communication with Ibn Baud than those that now exist. I have carefully examined the correspondence ending with the Duke of Devonshire’s telegram Ho. 210, dated the 30th of AiJril 1923, on the subject of the substitution of the Honourable the Resident in the Persian Gulf for the High Commissioner in Baghdad as the medium of communication between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud, and I can find nothing therein to suggest that it was the intention of His Majesty’s Government that direct correspondence between the High Commissioner and Ibn Saud on purely ’Iraq affairs should cease. Whatever the intention of His Majesty’s Government may have been, the fact remains that, since the departure of Sir Percy Cox on leave in the Spring of 1923 direct correspondence between the High Commissioner in Baghdad and Ibn Saud has ceased. No good purpose appears to have served in the past by this discontinuance of direct2&gt;q i direct relations between 'Iraq and Majd, and in at least one instan ce, name^A that of the camels looted from the Dhaiir in June last, which it now appears that Ibn Saud has been xor some months ready and anxious to return, consider- -able delay and confusion has resulted. It is essential that direct relations should now be re-established, and I hope that I may receive your telegraphic authority to communicate to Ibn Saud through His Britannic Majesty’s /*“' representative at Jiddah the ratification of the Balira Agreement, as soon as it has been effected, and in future to correspond direct with Ibn Saud, by the most expeditious means at my disposal, in all matters of detail affecting his relations with the ’Iraq Government and the steps to be taken to implement the agreements in force between the Governments of Najd and. Iraq. The correspondence will usually pass through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Jiddah or the Political Agent at Bahrain or Kuwait, accord- -ing to the whereabouts of Ibn Baud, and copies of corres- -pondence will be sent to the Resident at Bushire and to the Colonial Office for information. As I have stated above, I cannot discover that it was ever the intention of His Majesty’s Government that direct correspondence bwtween ’Iraq and Najd should cease, but it has ceased for so long that it appears necessary that Ibn Saud should be informed of your approval to its resumption. I request therefore that, should you approve my proposal, you will be good enough to intimate your approval to Ibn Baud as well as to myself as early as possible. 5. This step will not, however, in my opinion, be enough to secure a satisfactory solution of frontier tribal difficulties. In the case of both Persia and Syria it was found that, when dealing with minor frontier troubles, correspondence between the central Governments was too dilatory a method to secure satisfactory results, and a system \4 system of direct correspondence between the frontier officials of ’Iraq and those of Persia and Syria respect- -ively has been introduced with very satisfactory results. Similar correspondence has ev-4# in very minor cases, proved effective in settling incidents on the Turkish frontier. I hope that it may eventually be possible to induce Ibn Saud to agree to the introduction of a similar system as between ’Iraq and Hajd. Such a system would not be in conflict with Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement which refers not to correspondence between subordinate officials of the two Governments but to correspondence between the central Government on one side and subordinate officials ofL chiefs on the other. Ibn Saud is exceedingly chary of deputing any powers to his subordinate commanders, and the question will have to be tackled with care, but Sir Gilbert Clayton, with whom I have had the advantage of discussing it, and who expressed his complete agreement with my views, consid- -ers that there should be no great difficulty in eventually securing Ibn Baud’s agreement to an informal agreement of this nature. 6.

In one of our conversations, X asked Your Excellency to elucidate the meaning of ‘Tonifications’ 5 and you explained that the consifuciion of - a wall round, the villages concerned, according to the custom prevailing in the desert for the prevention of thefts and raids, as well as the construction of a military barracks for the housing of Public Security troops and the placing of a gun or a few machine guns according to the require ments of public security, would not be considered as being fortifications of the kind which we undertook to abstain from erecting; but that such works should be considered as necessary for the preserva tion of order. The object of the present letter is to obtain cleat confirmation of that frora Y r our Excellency so that we should bo perfectly explicit about mis constructions as might arise from the intrigues of mischief-makers.

Sir J. Shuckburgh, K.C.M.Q., C ,B. (in the Chair) Mr. G.L.M. Clauson, O.B.E. Mr. J.H.Hall, D.S.O., M.C. Mr. S. Robinson The Hon. T. Spring Bice, C.M.G. Mr. V.A.L. Mallet Mr. L.D. Wakely, C.B. Group Capt. C.S. Burnett, C. B.IS., D.S.O. Squadron Leader W.B. Farrington, D. S.O. ) Colonial ) ) Office. Foreign Office. India Office, iir Ministry. The following points were discussed 1 • The control of future reaLtiions with Ibn Saud and Channel of Communication . Sir J. Shuckourgh pointed out that hitherto the Foreign Office had dealt with the Hejaz and the Colonial Office with Hejd. He drew attention to the recommendation made by the Mas ter ton-Smith Committee that the channel of communication between His Majesty’s Government and the Hejaz Government should be the Foreign Office but that, in all questions affecting purely Arab politics, the Colonial Office should be regarded as the responsible British authority. He said that he had referred the question of the control of future relations with Ibn Saud to the Secretary of State and that Mr. Aaery’s views were as follows (a) Apart from questions off detail arising out of the Bahra Agreement with regard to which the High Commissioner for Iraq had already been authorised to deal direct with Ibn Saud through the British Agent atlJeddah, all communications with Ibn Saud should pass through the Foreign Office and H.M. Consul at Jeddah. (b) the final responsibility for all questions affecting Arabian politics whether relating to the Hejaz of Hejd should rest with^the Colonial Office. (c) \ the responsibility for local and consular questions concerning the Hejaz, including the pilgrimage should rest with^the Foreign Office. Sir J. Shuckburgh addedthat, in his opinion, the Foreign Office should also beprimarily responsible in all matters concerning Ibn Saud's relations with Foreign Powers. He explained that these proposals would, in practice, very largely mean the continuance of the present arrangements, except that the channel of communication via Bushire would be eliminated; although this channel could always be revived, either in addition to or instead of the Jeddah channel, in the case of necessity. Mr. Spring Rice said that he agreed generally with the proposals but would have to fefer them to higher authority. Questions of Arabian policy would as hitherto be dealt\ with by consultation between the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office, but the Foreign Office would xxxi prefer not to lay down anything definite until the future relationsrelations with Ibn Saud had been defined by the conclusion ?^t-» treaty ‘ Sir J■ Sh uckburhh said that He was ture tha„ there was no intention of altering the present arr'ingements under which action integard to Held or Hejaz affairs was concerted between the Foreign Office and/the olonial Office, but that the view of the Secretary 'of State for the Colonies was that the Colonial Office should m principle be regarded as the Department primarily responsible for dealing with questions of policy in Arabia and. therefore the Department whose view should normally prevail As regards the question who would deal with Parliamentary Questions relating to Ibn Baud, the general view of the Conference was that, in deference to Ibn Saud f 3 ezjjressed wish that his reiationsjshould be with the fforeign Ofxice, such questionsjshould normally be answered by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but that the Colonial Office should furnish the material for the replies• (2) Revision of the 1916 Treaty with Ibn Saud . Sir J. Shuckburgh said that it was clear that the existing Treaty between His Majesty^ Government and Ibn Saud was no longer appropriate and would have to be xmmJl revised. It was agreed that a polite message should be xk sent to Ibn Saud informing him that Sir G. Clayton had reported his desire for a revision of the Treaty: that His Majesty’s Government realised that the circumstancee nad changed and that it was desirable to revise the treaty; and that a communication on the subject would be addressed to him very shortly. / |gr Spring Pace suggested that the/ new treaty should contain as little detail as possible, and urged that as the whole negotiation of the treaty must be'largely a matter of tactics, it would be desirable before making any definite proposals to have the views of Sir G. Clayton who was already on the way back to England from Aden. Subject to this reservation, he proposed the undermentioned subjects as suitable for inclusion in the Treaty, and these were agreed to provisionally and subject to certain reser vations shown in the notes. (a) declaration of perpetual peace and friendship (b) recognition by Ibn Saud of His MajestyAs Government’s special position in the neighbouring Mandated Territories. (c) agreement by Ibn Saud not to interfere with Arab rulers with whom K.M.G. were in treaty relations, e.g. Kuwait, Bahrain. ( Hote . It was agreed that the actual xxs. rulers to whom this should apply would have to be carefully considered.) (d) Settlement of the Trane-Jordan-Hejaz frontier. (e) Something on the lines of Article 5 of the 1916 Treaty providing for the protection, etc., of pilgrims, (Hote . It was agreed that it would be necessary to consult the Government of India before any forms of words could be put to Ibn Baud.) (f) promise by Ibn Saud to co-operate in the sup pression of the Slave Trade and to recognise the practice of consular manumission at Jeddah. It was agreed that the question of retaining the substance of Article 2 of the present treaty (viz. pro tection against foreign agression) should be discussed withMiddle East would require further consideration —Ql„..a..g,uosidx«_ Ksx It was agreed that the payment off a subsidy to Ibn Saud was out of the question, and that this question should not be mentioned in any communication addressed to Ibn Saud. U) Arms . Mr. Mallet pointed out that Ibn Saud*8 request to Sir G. Clayton for arms was made before he had captured Medina and Jeddah, as a result of which considerable stores of arms and ammunition passed into his possession. It was agreed that, although it might be advisable in the future to allow him to purchase in Great Britain arms for Governmental purposes, it would be undesirable to volunteer to do atx do at present. It was accordingly agreed that his request under this head should be ignored. X (5) Representation in Damascus . Mr. Spring Rice said the representative in Damascus should be allowed to go, by degrees # but that at the same time, the Consul should keep in personal touch with him. It was agreed that Ibn Saud should be informed that the attention of His Majesty’s Government had been called to the question and that they had taken his correspondence with Sir G. Clayton into consideration and have no objection to his entering into direct correspondence with the French authorities in Syria through his representative at Damascus. 6. Arrangements for Pilgrimage . It was agreed that the foreign Office should telegraph to the British Consul at Jeddah asking him how far he was in a position to meet Ibn Saud l s request for an early estimate of the total number of pilgrims likely to perform the pilgrimage this year and whether he wished H.M.G. to take steps to obtain further information to supplement that already in his possession. 7. Hejdi delegationfco India. It was uecided that in writing to Ibn Saud it should be pointed out that this matter had now been satisfactorily disposed of in accordance with his wishes. 8* Senussi . It was agreed that no action should be taken on an^no communication made to Ibn Saud with Reference to his intercession on behalf of trie Senussi, pending the xxx return of Sir G. Clayton who had promised to make enquiries in Cairo. 9. Harbour at Has Tannura . As Sir G. Clayton had proposed to take up the matter with the aurhorities in Bombay, it was agreed to await his return before considering what action was possible on this, and that in the meantime no communication on the subject should be made to Ibn Saud. 10. delimitation o f Trans-Jordan Fr ontier. It was agreed that the delimitation onTthe spot of the frontier laiddown in the Hadda Agreement should be deferred tintil the new treaty with Ibn Saud had been concluded, when it would be possible to arrange for the delimitation of the whole of the ffxgraaxar frontier between Ibn Saud’s territories and British Mandated territory to be carried out as one operation. Mr Spring Rice pointed out, however, that the Foreign Office were anxious to have the frontier settled as there had been complaints of frontier infringements on the part of both the French authorities in Syria and of Ibn Baud.Ko♦6067 Baghdad, 27th May A «26.

Sir, 1 have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 75 dated the 15th of May. 1927, on the subject of the tribunal set up under the terma of the Hadda ,kjX'e .-mat and to transmit for your information the enclosed copy of the report submitted by A. H. Webb, Esq., K.C., the President of the Tribunal. 2. It will be seen that by the action of the Nejd deis^ates the work of the tribunal has been suspended, whether finally or only temporarily depends on the decision taken by the King of the He jag and Hejd after consideration of the enclosed report. 3. The attitude to the tribunal of the Hejd delegates from the first has resembled that of the oriental petitioner who complained that 'this judge is unjust: he listens to both sides*. And although their demeanour became sensibly modified for the better by contact with the British president and experience of the procedure of the tribunal, it was fairly erident that no satisfactory result would be achieved unless the hearing of rival claims by the Nejd and Trans-Jordan Sheikhs could be mad© almost simultaneously and the tribunal thus enabled to strike a fair balance between them. The adjournment pro posed by the President and referred to in paragraph 6 The Right Honourable of .1.8. Amery. P.C., M.P., Hi* Majesty*s Principal Secretary for the Colonies. of Stateof his report h&amp;d therefore my full concurrence. Its acceptance would hare given the Hejd authorities sufficient time to sift and appraise the Trans-Jordan counterclaims. 4. The next step is with Ihn Baud. If t after reconsideration, he decides to allow his delegates to return and will give them the requisite powers the tribunal can be reassembled in August next. If, on the other hand, he is of opinion that the semi-judicial procedure which a tribunal so constituted is bound to follow is unsuitable for the purpose in view, I shall be prepared to consider his proposals for an alternative method of composing inter-tribal disputes on account of raids across the Nejd - Trans-Jordan frontier. I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosures to the Consul at Jeddah. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) a.. S* Byrnes. Officer Administering the GovernmentThe District Court, Nablus, Palestine. 13th May, 1927. The Honourable, The Chief Secretary for Palestine. Gorernment Offices, Jerusalem, Sir, I hare th* honour to submit herewith the Minutes of the sittings of the Hadda Tribunal and to report as follows:« !• The Tribunal met on 4th February, 1927, and that and the followii^ day were occupied by a discussion as to whether the Tribunal should consider only claims arising out of raids which took place since the date of the Hadda Agreement, or whether some earlier, and, if so, what date should be taken as the et&amp;rtir^, point. The Trans-Jordan delegates argued that only raids since the date of the Hadda Agreement should be considered, while the Nejd delegates proposed either Ramadan 1343 or the date of the occupation of Jauf (July 1921) as the starting point. It was obrious that each side wished to select the date which it believed likely to result most advantageously to itself. In my opinion the Hadda Agreement, though nothing definite is said on the point, contemplated that the Tribunal would be set up to deal with future raids only, but 1 was anxious to obtain, if possible, an agreed decision, and accordingly the TribunaliribuBal Mijournod until t*li@ BtJbi Fobruscy, wh®n tb® I ran®-*Jordan &amp;el©^at@® announcad that tb©y had b®en authorised to u&amp;tm to tbs occupation of Jauf (July 1921) as the starting point* 2. The next quest ion that arose was as to which claims this Tribunal should consider, the Nejd delegates arguing that only their claims as from Ramadan 1343, of which particulars were before the Tribunal, should be do t it with, leaving earlier claims to be dealt with by some otrier Tribunal, As the adoption of this course might have resulted in there being an award made againat certain tribee on the one aide or the other, who had apparently valid counter-olaims the considera tion of which would be perhaps indefinitely postponed, I suggested that the difficulty might be met by postponing the actual execution of the award until all claims had been considered. The Nejd delegates said that they must take the instructions of their Government upon this, but took up the position that their authority was only to present the claims made by Nejd tribes and have them adjudicated upon, but that they were not authorised to receive or consider any claims by Trans-Jordan tribes. After some discussion it was agreed that the Nejd delegates should ask for (1) instructions as to the postponement of execution and (2) authority to receive aiyi consider the claims of the Trans-Jordan tribes. 3, The Tribunal then proceeded to consider shat method of proof of claims or disproof of liability should be adopted. 3abri~al Aasali, one of the Nejd delegates, said that he was prepared to suggest three possible methods but that his instructions were to suggest8ugg«Bt th© first aM only to reveal the second if the first were rejected. I only mention this proposal, wnich seems like one propounded to some cfearaoter in a tale from the Thousand and One Nights, because it is so typical of the attitude of this gentleman, who was the spokesman of th* Nejd delegates. Eventually it was a^eed that only the Sheikh of the tribe alleged to have been responsible for each raid should be summoned and put upon oath as to whether the claim was true in whole or in part, his denial upon oath being accepted as conclusive. The Tribunal then adjourned. 4. The Tribunal met again on the 17th February when the Nejd delegates stated that they were willing to receive a copy of the claim of the Trams-Jordan tribes but without prejudice until a copy had been served on their Government and its instructions received. The Trans-Jordan delegates objected that they had been authorised to consider claims fro® both sides but that they could not agree to be members of a Tribunal which was to deal only with claims against Trans-Jordan tribes. At the meeting of the 22nd February the Mejd delegates stated that they had received instructions which were not clear and the Tribunal again adjourned in order that they might ask whether they were at liberty to accept claims earlier than Ramadan 1343 and also to consider claims made by Trans-Jordan tribes before these had been officially notified to their Government. 5, The Tribunal met again on the 23rd March when the Nejd delegates stated that their Government hadthat the claims of both GoYerrsaenta should b© submitted to tli© Tribunal, consideration of those arising out of raids which took place between the occupation of Jauf mi. Ramadan 1343 being postponed until the necessary particulars had been prepared. They further stated that they were authorised to consider the claims of Trans-Jordan tribes arising out of raids since Ramadan 1343, but asked for a copy of such claims so that they could study it and obtain instructions from their Govern ment. 6. At the meeting of the 24th March the Tribunal went through the Mejd claims since Ramadan 1343 particulars of which had already been submitted and authorised me to forward to the Trans-Jordan Govemmenb a list of the Sheikhs alleged to have been responsible with a request to be informed what notice would be necessary in order to enable them to attend before the Tribunal. 7. The Tribunal met on the 11th April when I stated that 1 had been informed that about six weeks notice to the defendant Sheikhs would be required, and 1 suggested that as the Trans-Jordan claims had now been sent to the Mejd Government and in consequence Sheikhs of Mejd tribes would also have to attend before the Tribunal, it would be more convenient in the circum stances for the Tribunal t© adjourn until August, when the defendant Sheikhs from both sides could attend and the Tribunal would be in a position to adjudicate at the one time upon claims by Trans-Jordan as well as claims by Mejd* After some discussion the Mejd delegates agreed to submit this proposal to their Government and the^h© Tribunal adjourned* 8 * 111© Tribunal is©if a^ain on tih© lObh May when th© Hejd delegates haiKied in the memorandum, a translation of which is attached to the Minutes, stating m effect that the Nejd Government regarded th© claims put forward by th© Trans-Jordan Government as fraudulent and fictitious and that no useful purpose would be served by continuing the sittings of the Tribunal. The dslegEues sta&amp;ed that with the presentation of this Memorandum their authority to represent their Government cease 1, and Sabri el Assali added for my information out not officially that his Government did not propose to summon Nejd Sheikhs to clear themselves from liability for claims which th© Government believed to be unfounied. The sittings of the Tribunal then terminated, 9* In my opinion the action of the Nejd Government in withdrawing its delegates from the Tribunal was entirely unjustified. It was no doubt right and proper that th© Nejd Government should have an opportunity of seeing the claims made by the Trans-Jordan Tribes in order that, if it were disposed to act fairly, ary undisputed loot might have been at once returned, as, indeed, it was suggested would be done in Sheikh Yousef YasinU letter of 24.2,1927 to the British igent at Jedda, But the Nejd Governnent, which was a party to the Hadda Agreement under which this Tribunal was constituted for the very purpose of adjudicating upon disputed claims, had no right to take upon itself to decide whether any particular claim was true or false and thereby to oust th© jurisdiction of the Tribunal, Its action is th© more indefensible in that, if these claimsclaims were in fact false or exaggerated, the defendant Sheikhs had only to appear and take the oath in order to escape liability. The Mejd Government cannot therefore suggest that it acted from the fear that ifee Tribunal might be deceived by false evidence. At the Ma f an Tribunal the Nejd delegates attempted to adopt a similar attitude, as appears from telegram Ho* 201/M of 29* 7.1926 from the High Coraissioner to the British Agent, Jedda, and, in my opinion, the only conclusion to be drawn is that the Nejd Government never had any intention of allowing the claims of the Transjordan tribes to be considered, still less to be satisfied. On the other hand the Transjordan Government and its delegates appeared to be actuated by a desire to do what was right* It was, perhaps, technically in error not to have given notice of its claims to the Mejd Government, but one can understand that it may well have felt that it would be useless to do so having regard to the fact mentioned by the Chief British Representative that the first claim made was rudely dismissed as fictitious and to the result that followed when the claims were finally presented. I do not think that any real charge of delay can be imputed to the Trans jordan Government, at all events so far as the proceedings of this Tribunal are concerned. The minutes show that the numerous and lengthy adjournments were almost all at the request of the Mejd delegates and were due to their unwillingness or inability to agree to any decision without express authority, 10. I see now that I might perhaps have forced matters10 maitsra to a head at an earlier stage without affecting tho ultimate result and I can only express i^y regret for t/ie additional expense that has been caused by my failure to do so. 1 was, howewer, somewhat slow to realise aust was tea attitude of the Nejd Gowenxaent and mj whole endeavour was to ensure that the Tribunal should slot fail uO effect its purpose because of some triviality and that, if either party withdrew, it should appear to be manifestly in the wrong. 11 . I have written throughout in the first person but 1 am far from wishing to conceal the great ^ assistance 1 received from Mr. Champion. At the ^ meetings of the Tribunal I was the spokesman but what I said was the result of discussion with him and very often had been suggested by him. 1 wish also to acknow ledge idle valuable services of Ibrahim Bff. Kaabani who acted as sooretary to the Tribunal. In addition to being an admirable interpreter he displayed the greatest tact in dealing with the delegates and the lengthy and often rather pointless discussions between them.

In fact we have submitted copy of the Trans jordan claims to our Government and it appeared lately that these claims were only put forward by the Trans jordan Government in order to pose as claimant of a right. Hence their submitting such unreasonable claims which lack even a shadow of truth. The insistence of the Trans-Jordan Government on putting forward these claims and the attitude they have taken, from time to time, in delaying the examination of our just claims prompt us to believe that the Trans-Jordan Government are not anxious to see the immediate settlement of this dispute, which we had sincerely hoped will be amicably and satisfactorily settled. Permit us to say that no useful purpose would be served by the continuation of the sittings of this Tribunal, the object of which was to give justice to whom justice is due, so loi^ as the Trans-Jordan Govern ment persist in their attitude as stated above, Yery respectfully yours, (Signed) Abdul Asis.

The foreign nationality of Hijazis who have in the past of who will in the future become naturalised, except as above mentioned, will not be recognised in any respects or circum stances.

The signature of Passports and Certificates of XitflQtkjcjQt Nationality would constitute him an official representative of Bin Oa*ud at Kuwait, and the in the absence of ^previous sanction of my Government I was unable to recognise him as such. 7. Nafisi replied that His Excellency Bhaikh Ahmad al Jabir as-Bubah, 3uler of Kuwait had explained the situation to him, and H.M. the King of Hijaa and Najd hoped that I would kindly assist by getting the necessary sanction from my Government. 8. I said that I would refer the question to the Besident in the Persian Gulf and I suggested that in the meantime he should issue no more certificates. 9. He readily agreed to my suggestion and said that in fact he had isimed none since his interview with H.E. Bhaikh Ahmad on 29th September. Before that date he had signed 90 Nationality Certifies cates and sent them to Bin mighaithir for issue at Zubair. 10. I have ascertained from the Huler of Kuwait that he is himself strongly opposed to the acceptance in Kuwait of an official or representative of any State at or Government whatever. 11. In my opinion Bhaikh Ahmad though opposed to receiving a Najd agent, would comply with thePag© 3 wishes of His Hajesty*s Government in the matter. 12 . He recently refused to accede to the request of the Persian Government which was supported hy His Majesty’s Government, that the political Agent should protect Persian nationals in Kuwait, hut he would not dare to refuse to accept Bin ^a’ud’s representative unless he was sure of British support in his attitude.

The • ’Iraq Government in reply contest Your Majesty’s claim that Muhammad ibn Kijlad and the Dahamshah tribe are Najd subjects under Article i of the Second Protocol signed at ’Uqair, Their views having already been communicated to Your Majesty by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Jiddah, in his letter No .191 M dated l./r- 4th of August 1 e26. The Article to which Your Majest 3 r refers provides that ’’should any tribe or section of a tribe which la outside the boundaries of and not subject to either Government desire, to offer its allegiance to one of them they will not prevent it from doing so”. In order therefore to substantiate the claim put forward by Your Majesty that the Dahamshah are Najd subjects by virtue of this Article, it is necessary to prove that at the time of the signature of the f Uqair Protocol (namely 2 nd December ! $ 22 ), the Bahamshah were outside the boundaries of ’Iraq and that they were not iixaui subject to the ’Iraq Government 3* Whatever doubt may formerly have existed, owing to the indefinite nature of the frontier etc.,'as to the position of the Dahamshah in relation to the Governments of ’Iraq and Najd, this question was finally settled by Article l(e; of the Treaty signed at Mu ha aimer ah on the 5 th of May 1922, which provided that ”th© tribes known as the Muntafiq, Dhafir and ’ Amaral, will belong to * ’Iraq”, The Dahamshah, as Your Majesty is aware, is a section of the ’Amaral. It follows therefore that seven months before the ’Uqair Protocal was signed, it was agreed by Your Majesty’s Government that the Dahamshah were subject to ’Iraq and conse quently Article 1 of the Second ’Uqair Protocol cannot be held to cover their case4. \s regards tne question of direct eoramunleation between tne late Fahad Beg and Ibn Musa’id, I find that Pahad Beg did write to Ibn Musa’Id as Your Majesty.states and that it was pointed out to hlia at the tlae that his action was irregular and inust not be repeated. The ’Iraq Government are gratified to note that Your Majesty has sent similar Instructions to Ibn Musa®id, • 2 * regards the statement contained in the fourth paragi*aph of Jfour Majesty’s letter that the attack by Ibn Rimma! on Ibn MlJlad took place in the Hisb territory ^anu that the territory in question is within the neutral area which is common to ’Iraq and Najd, th 6 ’Iraq Government point out that Your Majesty appears to have been misinformed. Immediately after the incident took place a British Officer visited the place where it occurred by aeroplane and definitely located it as being in the bed of the Sha’lb Hisb between Samit and Shabichah about 10 miles north of the ‘Iraq - Najd frontier. The neutral area defined in Article i(d) of €he ®Uqalr Protocol No a ^ is over 100 miles to the south east of the area where the incident took place., Th© ’Iraq Govt, trust that Your Majesty will give careful attention to this point as they fear that any misconception as to the correct location of the neutral zone may lead to difficulties in future if not corrected. 6 * In the circumstances therefore the* 'Iraq Government must . maintain their contention that Ibn Ri&amp;aal violated Mraq territory in order to punish an ’Iraq tribe for raiding another ’Iraq tribe, and that this constitutes a breach of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement* 7. The 8 Iraq Government understand that the loot belonging to the Suqur tribe has been recovered from Ibn MiJlad by the Amir of Hail and they accordingly request that Your Majesty will be good enough to issui? instructions for the return of this loot as soon as possible through the appropriate frontier officials . 8 * Since the preceding paragraphs of this letter were written I have received Your Majesty’s letter dated the 3Cth August 1927 { 1 st Rabi* I 1 146; protesting against the action of the Mutasarrif, Diwanlyah Liwa f in addressing correspondence directX No . 13m SECRETARIAT OF H.E. r mE HIGH .

Journey to Po7t Sudan. ^ i 1 l e . ft Lonclon o 11 the 15th April, 1927, for Marseilles, where I embarked on tne Hibby Line steamship “ Lancashire,” arriving at Port Sudan on the 24th April I was accompanied from London by Mr. S. R. Jordan, and Mr. G. Antonins joined the mission at Port Said on the 21st April. Delay in proceeding to Jeddah. o. On arrival at Port Sudan I received a telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s consul at Jeddah mfoiming me that Ibn Saud was not expected in Mecca before the 4th May. I therefore decided that Mr. Jordan should proceed to Jeddah in H.M.S. “Dahlia on the following day, while I remained for a few days in Port Sudan, accompanied by Mr. Antonins. I considered this arrangement desirable as I did not wish the mission to risk losing dignity by waiting about at Jeddah and affording material for local gossip and intrigue. Journey to Jeddah. 4. On the 1st May I embarked with Mr. Antonins in H.M.S. “ Dahlia ” ^Com mander Cotton, R.N.), arriving on the following morning at Jeddah, where I was received with due ceremony by the Hejazi authorities and conducted to His Britannic Majesty’s consulate. Arrival of Ibn Saud in Jeddah and Reception of Mission. 5. The arrival of Ibn Saud in Mecca was still further delayed until the 7th May, and he did not reach Jeddah until the morning of the 9th May, on the afternoon of which day the mission was received in audience by the King. The meeting was restricted to the usual exchange of greetings and compliments, and was marked by great cordiality anrl friendliness on the part of the King, who insisted that the mission should leave the consulate and occupy a house on the outskirts of Jeddah which he caused to be prepared for its reception. Initiation of Negotiations. 6. On the following day conversations began, and are given in detail in a subsequent despatch. Main Points at issue. 7. It was evident from tS|p results of the conversations at Wadi-al-’Aqiq, conducted in December last by Mr. Jordan and Mr. Antonius, that the main questions at issue wer — (a.) Recognition of the special position of His Majesty’s Government in mandated territories. (b.) Mutual recognition of national status. (c.) Retention of the right of manumission of slaves by His Majesty’s consular officers. (d.) The Hejaz-Transjordan frontier. The first two questions appeared to present no difficulty, as His Majesty’s Government had consented to meet Ibn Saud’s point of view in both cases. It was to be anticipated, however, that the requirements of His Majesty’s Government in respect of manumission and the Hejaz-Transjordan frontier would meet with strenuous opposition, and this forecast proved to be correct; indeed, at the close of the sixth meeting agreement was not yet in eight. 4004 [16248] Bi Private Interview with Ihn Saud—and his Attitude. 8. At this stage, however, Ibn Saud requested a private and personal interview with me, at which matters came to a head. He assured me that he appreciated tuny the reasons for the attitude taken up by His Majesty’s Government, ana begged me to believe that it was his earnest wish to meet their wishes in every possible way; tie was, however, in a very delicate position, especially in regard to the Hejaz Iransjordan frontier, and to sign the protocol at the present juncture would be to expose himselt to violent criticism not only by his enemies, but also by his friends; moreover, he had many difficulties to contend with in his task of consolidating the position which he had won, and he could not afford to undermine his own prestige or do anything to alienate his friends and strengthen his enemies. In conclusion, somewhat to my surprise, he said that he had now come to me, as a trusted friend, to ask my trank and impartial opinion as to his best course of action, and was prepared to accept and act upon my advice. Sir G. Clayton s Advice to Ihn Saud. 9. I replied that His Majesty’s Government had decided that they must retain the right of manumission and were also determined to maintain the Hejaz-Transjordan frontier as deffned in the draft protocol. Unless these two points were adequately safeguarded, no treaty was possible, and I had no hesitation in saying that, m my opinion, a rupture would react very unfavourably on his interests and those of his country. I strongly advised him, therefore, to meet the wishes of His Majesty s Government. Ibn Saud accepted my advice, and appealed to me to find a way in which the requirements of His Majesty’s Government could be met with the minimum of injury to his own position and prestige. Slave Traffic. 10. I did not feel able to suggest any solution of the question of the slave trade other than that of the insertion in the body of the treaty of an article by which Ibn Saud wmuld undertake to co-operate, as far as practicable, in its suppression, supplemented by an exchange of letters making it clear that His Majesty’s Government would continue to exercise the right of manumission by their consular officers. Frontier Question. 11. The question of the frontier, however, required fuller consideration. I could, perhaps, have induced Ibn Saud at that stage to sign the protocol, and I felt it very desirable to reach a definite settlement without delay. On the other hand, his arguments against this course were cogent, and it was obviously undesirable to force him into a really difficult position ; moreover, I was convinced that it would be better, in the interests of future co-operation and good relations, to ensure that the treaty should be signed in a spirit of real amity and confidence than to leave behind me a feeling that it had been concluded in an atmosphere of coercion as opposed to one of mutual agreement. Exchange of Letters re Frontier Question. 12. I therefore decided in favour of a solution on the lines of paragraph 11 of my instructions, and informed Ibn Saud that, while still maintaining that signature of the draft protocol was the most satisfactory course to follow, I was ready to accept an exchange of letters such as would recognise adequately the position which His Majesty’s Government had decided to maintain. Ibn Saud held by his promise to accept my advice on both points, and went as far as to say that, if I would draft the necessary letters, he would sign them, an understanding which he duly fulfilled. Question of Nationality and Tribunals. 13. Agreement now appeared to have been reached on all the more contentious questions and it only remained for Mr. Antonins and Ibn Sand’s advisers to settle various minor points in sub-committee and to draw up the final draft. During the discussions in sub-committee, however, an unexpected difficulty arose. Ibn Baud’s advisers tried by all possible means to extend the scope of article 6 in such a manner as to involve a complete renunciation of the Capitulations by His Majesty’s Govern ment, and finally they informed Mr. Antonins that the King would be unable to sign the treaty unless I agreed to renounce the Capitulations or, at least, to inform him in writing that His Majesty’s Government would raise no objection if he were to abolish them by proclamation.Negotiations at a Deadlock on the Question of Capitulations. 14. I saw Ibn Sand the next morning and, finding that his advisers had described the situation correctly, I informed him categorically that I was unable to accede to his demand. He remained firm and insisted that he could sign no treaty unless the jurisdiction of his courts was fully recognised in all cases, both civil and criminal, and m regard to foreigners as well as natives. I urged that His Majesty’s Government had already made a great concession in article 6 and begged him to reflect before he wrecked the treaty by persisting m a demand to which it was beyond my power to accede ; but he refused to give way and a rupture appeared almost inevitable. Solution of the Capitulations Difficulty. 15;. Mr. Antonius then had one ipore private interview with Dr. Abdullah Damlnji and Sheikh Hafez \\ ahba in the hope of finding some solution at the eleventh houi, and it transpired at length that there had been a misunderstanding and some confusion of ideas m the Kings mind. Article 6, far from being regarded as a concession, had given rise to grave suspicion in the minds of Ibn Sand’s advisers, who interpreted it as an attempt to obtain recognition of the principle of Capitulations under the guise of a concession in regard to a specific portion of them. They had communicated their suspicions to the King, wdro, having hitherto maintained the attitude of ignoring the existence of Capitulations altogether, immediately became alarmed and took up an extreme attitude. Conclusion and Signature of Treaty. 16. The situation was now clear and Ibn Sand’s advisers, having been reassured as to the intention of iflis Majesty’s Government, suggested that the elimination of the offending article and the addition of a vague, and I consider innocuous, sentence at the end of article 5 would probably secure agreement. I saw the King the next morning and proposed this solution, to which he agreed at once. The final text was then prepared and the treaty was duly signed and the letters exchanged on the evening of the 20th May, at the conclusion of a dinner which the King gave in honour of the mission. The texts are enclosed herein. Questions outside the Scope of Treaty. 17. I will now explain the action taken in regard to certain questions which are dealt with in my instructions, but which do not fall within the compass of the treaty. ]\)sition of Iraq. 18. In paragraph 6 of my letter of instructions I w r as directed to explain to Ibn Sand the position of the Iraq Government and to proceed to an exchange of notes recognising that, while Iraq is outside the scope of the treaty, His Majesty’s consular officers in the Hejaz and Nejd may afford protection to Iraqis in those territories so long as Iraq does not herself maintain representatives there. Postponement of Iraq Question. 19. I had intended to deal with this question after conclusion of the negotiations, and I did not anticipate that it would give rise to any difficulty. Unfortunately, the question of nationality and that of tribunals, dealt with in articles 5 and 6 of the draft treaty, had produced a very acute situation, and I was convinced that if I raised the question of Iraq I should once more provoke grave, even though unfounded, suspicion and probably wreck the treaty irretrievably. I therefore decided that it was necessary to postpone the question for the present. It is a question of fact and not of negotiation, and can properlv be communicated through the usual official channels to the Government of the Hejaz and of Nejd at some convenient time, possibly when the exchange of ratifications takes place. Hejaz Nationality Law. 20. Ifor similar reasons I thought it unwise to discuss the objections put forward by His Majesty’s Government to certain articles in the Hejaz Nationality Law, promulgated on the 29th September, 1926. The matter is not one of immediate urgency, and will be better dealt with by His Majesty’s consul at Jeddah after the treaty has been ratified. H6248j B 24 Removal of Embargo on Import of Arms. 21. I explained to Ibn Sand that His Majesty’s Government were pf opinion that the supply of arms was a question which could not properly be dealt with m the body of the main treaty. This question has been made the subject of an exchange or letters between Ibn Saud and myself on the lines laid down in my instructions. Hejaz Railway. 22. Ibn Saud raised the question of the Hejaz Railway, and I informed him that, for practical reasons, it had not been possible to give effect to his request that the railway should be put in order for this year’s pilgrimage; but His Majesty s Govern ment were discussing the matter with the French Government with a view to the necessary steps being taken to secure the reopening of the railway in time for the pilgrimage of 19218. The King, after expressing the earnest hope that every effort , would be made to secure the operation of the railway before next year s pilgrimage, asked to be given, as soon as possible, a statement of the situation up to date, and to be kept fully informed as to the progress of negotiations. He added that he presumed that he would be given the opportunity of nominating a representative to the conference which must be held with a view to arranging a final settlement, and asked to be furnished, in good time, with all the details and information necessary for a thorough study of the question. Awqaf-eUHar amain, 23. I discussed with the King the question of the Awqaf-el-Haramain, and explained to him that it was contrary to the invariable principle of His Majesty s Government to interfere in religious matters or in the decisions of religious, or even of civil, courts. His Majesty’s Government, therefore, regretted that they did not see their way to exerting any influence to assist him in obtaining the revenues of VVakfs, which he maintained should be devoted to the upkeep and improvement of the sanctuaries of Islam at Mecca and Medina. Ibn Saud replied that he appreciated and respected His Majesty’s Government’s point of view, but he thought that his request for assistance in this matter had perhaps been misunderstood. He had no wish to ask His Majesty’s Government to interfere in religious matters or in the operation of courts, either religious or civil. He proposed to apply through the proper channels for those Wakf revenues which he considered should be paid over to him, and, if necessary, to bring actions before the competent tribunals. All he asked of His Majesty’s Government was that they should help him, as far as possible, to obtain justice in cases where unfair influence might be exerted against him and his claims unjustly blocked by refusal to furnish necessary information or by other methods. He asked that His Majesty’s Government should reconsider his request in the light of these explanations, and make a further communication to him as soon as possible. He also requested that he might be assisted by being furnished with— (a.) Information as to what Awqaf-el-Haramain existed in India. (b.) Advice as to the proper steps to take with a view to preferring and establishing such claims as he might wish to make. (c.) The normal measure of guidance and assistance to any delegation which he might decide to send to India, or elsewhere, for the purpose of making enquiries and preferring claims. Departure from Jeddah and Return to England. 24. On the ^Ist May the mission paid an official farewell visit to the King and then embarked on the Italian steamship “ Nasario Sauro,” arriving at Suez on the morning of the 2Mth May and proceeding to Cairo on the same day. Five days were spent in Egypt in liquidating the business of the mission, and on the 29th May I embarked in the P. and 0. steamship “ Ranpura,” accompanied by Mr. Jordan, arriving in London, via Marseilles, on the 4th June. Mr. Antoni us remained in Egypt and returned thence to Jerusalem. Thanks to Local Authorities. 25. I cannot close this report without jalacing on record the extreme kindliness of our reception by the King and ail the officials of his Government with whom we came in contact. Everything possible was done for our comfort and convenience, and the negotiations were carried out in an atmosphere of extreme friendliness and good humour.on the'miss.on^Mfs.’ VlorZ t ^ ^fered by my colleagues Wori; oi’A„; 111 • LV - ^Oiaan ana Mr. b-.

Your Majesty, IN continuation of our conversations relating to the question of the slave trade, 1 have the honour to inform your Majesty that His Britannic Majesty’s Government feel it their duty to abstain at present from renouncing the right of manumitting slaves, which has long been practised by His Majesty’s consular officers, and which enables them to liberate any slave who presents himself of his own free choice with a request for liberation and repatriation to his country of origin. I wish to assure your Majesty that His Britannic Majesty’s Government’s insistence on this right is not intended to mean any interference in the affairs of your Government or any infringement of your Majesty’s sovereignty ; but that it is due to His Britannic Majesty’s Government’s resolve to carry out a duty which they owe to humanity. I would add that His Britannic Majesty's Government will be prepared to consider theabolition of the right of manumission as soon as it becomes clear to both parties that the co-operation stipulated in article 8 of the r I reaty of Jeddah has resulted ^ in the enforcement of such practical measures as to render the exercise of the right of manumission no longer necessary. . . , I trust that your Majesty will appreciate the attitude of His Ilritanmc Majesty s Government in this matter and that you will see fit to acquiesce in the procedure which I have described above.

As you are aware most of the inhabitants of Majd are deaertmen and that the greater part of their winter abode in winter and spring is in th ; northern and eastern regions of our country, close to the ’Iraq frontier and far away from our headquarters.

It is however regretted that we hare hod no answer from you to our two letters. Out of the desire on our part to expedite the removal of the cause of difference we have written this to Your JSxcrllrncy, hoping that you will order the removal oi these forts which are contrary to Article 3 of the above mentioned Protocol and the retention of which is fraught with evil possibilities of a nature that I cannot bear.

He is, however s in a very difficult position, as he is hated in the Hijaz, and has enemies in Najd even amongst his own family (it is almost certain that his brother and nephew were at the bottom of the plot to murder his son and Ubdullah bin Jilaw'- last summer) , and bhe Ikhwan tribes are tho poople whom h. to rely on most to keep him on his throne* Although he is extremely annoyed with them, therefore* he will not dare te^ try and punish the Siutstir ~ particularly in view of the fa, c t that in 1926 Faisal ad~Dawish, I bn Humaid and Dhaidan al~ Hithlain hound thiemselves by oath mutually to support each other in such a case* On the other hand he will probably restore is authority by persuasion and peaceful means* a will tinea be in a position to keep the tribes quiet « at rate for some time* This is what people hope will 1 as anything would be preferable to the appalling c* a revolution in Najd would entail, even if it 6.5 ban on trade between Najd and Kuwait* Meanwhile the recent events and Dawish*s success in raiding up to now are having an extremely bad effect on our prestige InArabia (the Government of T Iraq has none and is looked upon as a negligible spurakt quantity altogether)* People arguo that our alroraft cannot harm the raiders or protect the frontier# They do not understand our respect for treaties and frontiers: the reason why we do not retaliate and chastise the Mutair by bombing them or their villages is that we cannot or dare not do so* Xbn Sa’ud might possibly lodge a protest* but in reality he would be very pleased, were we to take suchw»n and to rifht into N 1 'jd and punish th»m. Unleus our ^eropianss have the good luck to get an Mi opportunity of teaching them a eevere lesson in the near future, not only rtll all des-rt tribes most certainly become Ikhwan, out I^waniem will probably spread to the Jaairah.
