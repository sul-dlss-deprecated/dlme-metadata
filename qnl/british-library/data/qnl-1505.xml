Also, in future P.a. ,-in order to solemnize marriages under the Foreign Office rules will first need a -warrant from the Secretary of State to do so (please see section d 4 of Consular Instructions). \Would marriages between British Indians and Pakistans continue to be solemnized under authority of the Indian Christian Marriage net?
