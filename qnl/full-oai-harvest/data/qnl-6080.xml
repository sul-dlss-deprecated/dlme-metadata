The bulk of the file is comprised of reports on various military, intelligence, and propaganda issues variously called 'the Arab report' or 'Arabian Report'. The file also contains reports on the massacre and forced migration of Armenians during the War, as well as intelligence gathering efforts by British officials on Indian Muslim political mobilisation in support of an independent Arab Kingdom in the Hejaz or the Ottoman Empire, often described as 'Pan-Islamist' in the file.Most of the correspondence relating to Pan-Islamist political mobilisation is conducted through the transmission and translation of newspaper articles in Iraqi, Egyptian, Indian, Syrian, and other Arab publications.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Sacred sites</topic></subject><subject><topic>Turkey--History--Ottoman Empire, 1288-1918</topic></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mecca</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Armed forces</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab nationalism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Panislamism</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab Revolt (1916-1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001e1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
