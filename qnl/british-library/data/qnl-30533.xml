The charge of the Post of the British Agent Gwadur was takeover 'by me from, Mr D. P. H. Domingo on the afternoon oft 3th June 1951* Economic. 102. Owing to monsoon and rough seas there was no launch traffic wortrirnemtioning during the fortnight under report, 'there istoc some uneasiness amongst the poor classes due to rise in the price of Atta(Flour). It is now being sold here at the rate of one seer per Rupee which is the price obtained in some of the famine stricken cities in India. Next door at Karachi the price of Atta (Flour) is (k) seer per Rupee. The price of meat too is exjiorbitant, it is Rupees2/4/- per seer while in a big city like Karachi it is about Rsl/12/- per seer. I am told dates which are exported from here are being sold at the rate of As10/- per seer while in Karachi they are being sold at the rate of Ad&amp; 8/- per seer. Some measure of price control over essential foodstuffs seems very desirable. In this connection attention is invited to Political Agent *s letter no32/5/l6/2|.9 dated the29th November 1949. Shipping. 103. During the period under report M. S. Daressa caled at Gwadur on 19th Junel 951 and M. S.

It was said it contained gold worth about Rs40,000/- After a vigorous search in-to the sea for about3 days the box was packed out of the sea. Grime. 104 . On the morning f©lowing the night of my arrival here a prisoner escaped from the Gwadur jail carrying with him a rifle. The wall stf sent his men to us asking for the use of the jeep on which we had come to Gwadur from Pasni. The jeep was given to wali’s men and with the help of the jeep the prisoner was arrested before he could cross the Gwadur border and was brought back to the jail. The wali felt grateful for the help.

On Saturday the 19th. the Administrator, edical Officer and the Head Master proceeded to Pishkan by truck on a tour of inspection. The Administrator went to inspect the Fort at Pishkan. The Medical Officer attended to the sick and he stated to me on his return that he was of the opinion that the water there was contaminated as Diarrhoea and Eysentry cases there were very high, he could not give an approximate number of cases he treated there.

The contraband was transferred from the Mujidiya to the Agra during the same night and the 'Agra' returned to Karachi after being in port about four hours. The Mujidiya launch returned to Karachi on the 4th. Communications. 90. The telehraph land line has been working for about three days during the period under review. The wireless is still out of order, though they have received another battery charging machine from Karachi, but it appears to be the same old one which was returned from this Post Office about three months back. The system of telegraphic communications is most unsatisfactory. In my opinion the public are pajring express telegraphic charges for urgent telegrams, only for them to be sent by slow mail, hence the public are being robbed. Telegrams dated the 10th, 11th and 12th. April marked express etc. were received here per the M.S.'Mtwara' on the 29th. Something really ought to be done to improve the system, either the Pakistan Government installs a new wireless with its battery charging machine, replaces the old land line, which is over 55 years old,with new wiring or allows a British Post Office to take over. Local Affairs. 91. A Miss or Mrs. Naomi Mitchison, well known British journalist, passed through Gwadur in the M.S. 'Dwarka' on the 7th February, 1951 on her way from Basrah.

Again on the 2?th. another downpour of rain which was not so severe but lasted much longer, say about three hours in all,.

This fish is then shipped to Colombo, alon^with other regular shipments, where it fetches a very high price on account of the black market in Colombo. 40.

The M.L.Majidiya arrived from Dubai on the 5th with no cargo or passengers. ^She was called from Karachi to Dubai direct by the syndicate (gold smugglers^ Jj 4 to collect a consignment of gold bars. The launch was there for just over a : month and the Nakhuda was told there was nothing for him. The Nakhuda received ^•Ps. 5000 /- detention charges etc.etc., and came to Cwadur. * $26. It has been discovered that till about six months back all the smuggled . gold from the Gulf into Pakistan was sent to Dacca, East Pakistan, from where it was smuggled across the border into India, and the price in Karachi was then ^ over Rs.100/- per tola. The Dacca agents then refused to accept any more gold owing to one or two consignments being caught on the Tndian border due to the Customs authorities (land'* tightening up there. Dacca’s refusal resulted in the Karachi market rate falling until now it is about Rs.92/- per tola with every likelihood of it dropping further. The syndicates operating at Gwadur S J '• and the Gulf are now obviously concentrating on sending their consignments to India direct as the current market rate there is about Rs.116/- per tola. 27.

The weather. 31. Gwadur is experiencing a very cold, dusty spell with the wind blowing from all four directions within twentyfour hours. There were good showers of rain on the 4th, 5th, and 6th and it looked like some more rain on the 7th but the wind changed and we had the north wind till the 9th. It was learnt that there were one or two casualties at the anchorage when the Dwarka arrived on the 7th. This has not been confirmed yet, but there is one fact that when a boat returned from the Dwarka with passengers and luggage it overturned in about four feet of water. No lives were lost but luggage was lost and damaged. Up to the 6th /MHHi Pa^e 2 Up to the 6 th we had a fair amount of rain, with a fairly good downpour on the 5 th. On the Koh-Batail rain water has been trapped in the catch ment which can be used for drinking purposes for about two months. When the north wind started up on the 7 th there were still heavy clouds overhead which were soon blown away and instead of rain, Gwadur was given a fair amount of sand and dust from the ’ r ekran desert. Visitors to the Koh-Batail witnessed a large section of the hill give way and go crashing down below. The cause for this might possibly be due to the rain and also masons obtaining stones which theydig out from the side of the hill for building purposes. Communications. 32. During the period under review both the wireless and the telegraph land line have been working very well indeed. Gwadur,For the period froml 24 -th to the 2?th January, 1951 . •Movements of Britis h Officials J Others . 8. Mr. D.P.H-Pomin^o returned from leave in the m.s. J&gt;’arka on the 21st January.

He accompanied Mr. Grant ashore and inspected the Customs office here.

Members of the public, finding that surcharged notes were being refused by certain merchants, began erasing the print and tried passing them on to the merchants. The merchants appealed to the Wali who called another meeting on the 1Ath. and warned the public that anyone found or suspected of spoiling these notes would be dealt with severely. However the merchants insisted in their protest to accept these notes and eventu ally won. These notes are no longer valid in Gwadur. As soon as this was agreed upon the merchant again held the upper-hand of the poorer classes and began buying these notes cheaply, e.g. Rs.1 /- was worth about 7 to 8 annas. This money is now being smuggled into Karachi where it is still being accepted at par by the Reserve Bank of Pakistan. One merchant namely Abdulla Abbas, a British subject, refused one of the notes which had been 'spoilt’ (the print had been rubbed out) from a customer, and the Amin of Customs and Khauda Allahbux ordered the merchant to close his shop immediately, though they have no authority to do sa.

The Director of Plant Protection Dr. Taskhir Ahmad, accompanied by Mr. Rashid Ahmad the Assistant Entimologist aodt at Panjgur and one other, arrived on the 23rd by jeep. Dr. Taskhir mentioned that they should have reached G-wadur on the 22 nd but due to rainfall their journey was hampered across the vast sandy areas, and they reached a place called Ankara Kaur on the 22nd night where they camped. The British Agent introduced the party to the Wali and Administrator. Dr. Taskhir stated that he wanted the help and co-operation of the local authorities so that immediate^ information could be sent to the nearest Anti Locust outpost at Suntsar if locust were sighted. He said nothing much could be done with swarms in flight but that what he was mainly interested in was the young ’hoppers’, and to explain this to the public he was prepared to get the officer from Suntsar to give a demonstration at Gwadur.

On the 3rd. January the .Amin of Customs announced that notes surcharged 'Jovemment of Pakistan'’ would not in future be accepted by the Customs. This led to the merchants also refusing to accept these notes from members of the public, which resulted in complaints to the ir ali who called a meeting and the Customs was asked to accept part of the duty in this currency, which was agreed to. 6. Some trouble arose during the period 1949-50 when devaluation came about and the merchants were at a loss as to how to dispose of these Indian notes surcharged ’’Covernment of Pakistan”. Of course these notes found their way into the hands of the poorer classes. The Administrator held a meeting to discuss the disposal of these notes and to find some way of doing it. Withir 48 hours after the meeting these notes were sent out of Owadur by the mer chants to Jiwani so the Administrator found it unnecessary to proceed further in the matter. If these notes have again found their way back to Gwadur the merchants themselves are to blame for accepting them. Communications. 7. During the period under review the telegraph land line and wirless have been working well. .
