See Political Department Mannual page 5 para 11.D*0*No#723# Political Agency, Bahrain, the 30th June 1933. Hy dear Fowls With reference to ray telegram No.668 dated the 15th June 1933, I have received letters of congratulations on the birth of Shaikh Salman’s son for His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Salman. I have delivered the former, but in that for Shaikh Salman he was described as 'Naib Hakim” (Deputy Ruler). This title was, as you know, used for Shaikh Hamad in his father’s life time, but should not, of course, be used for Shaikh Salman. In the circumstances, I thought it best to deliver the letter for Shaikh Hamad and to return this letter to you. Although it would have been nicer to have letters for each of them, I think that the one for Shaikh Hamad will suffice to show your interest. Yours sincerely, The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel T.C.W.Fowle,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Sulf, BUSTHRF.— 'pi, mmmfmmfmmmmmmrnm • - P.A., Forwarding letters to H.E.Shaikh Hanad and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad written and ^are submitted for signature nlease. rn , The letter and envelop* both addressed to S aikh Salman bin Hamad as Denuty Huler* v/e hava not been writing this in our letters to him and I beg to ask if this is to be followed by us. 27.6.33 The only thing is to send the one to H.E.
