Letter dated 18th November, from H # H # the Sultan, to the Political Agent, Muscat. pondence which has passed, be tween ! T is High ness and myself on' the subject. I attach .al!f?o a copy of a peti tion Just recei ved from the British Indian aubjects at ouweykh on the same subject. |p Th€t petition of the British Indians at Hhabura reached me at the begining ef September, and I at once sent the Lra^oman to His 'ighness with a message seeing that X had received this complairt, and asking His Highness if it was correct, as if so the tax appeared to be contrary to the Treaty between the British Uovemment and ris Kighr-ess. Fi« r'ighr ess replied that he would send a copy of the new orders, ,, , bUt^birt that t &amp;ey v/ere rot contrary to the Treaty# A day or two later Hi a Highness handed the Agency Dra^o^an a copy or hi© no tiification, a translation of which is annexfed# It will 'be observed that the dutieo are only applicable to the Batineh Coast; His Highness has two motives I believe in levying thou firstly to raise a little money as he is at present in great financial straits, and secondly tc prevent dates and other goods being shipped to Lebai for export instead of to Muscat. S.- Before receiving His Hishnesf; , notification I had however, instituted enquiries at Kaabura to verify the state ments of the Indian merchants, and also to find out the inci dence of the new duty and the amour;t of taxes, etc, which had hitherto beer paid by Indian traders 'by private arrangement with local officials. I did not receive details from Khabura till the beginning of October, by which time the Sultan had left on tour for 3ur and 3ohar. As I wished to discuss the matter with His Highness in order to gii^e him an opportunity of altering the orders about export dirty, I awaited his return 4.- His Highness only spent a few days during October in. Muscat, but directly after his return I paid him a visit on the Srd November, and pointed out to him that in my opinion the duty could not be levied without the previous concurrence of the British Government (vide Article 7 of the Commercial Treaty of 1691). His ighness then somewhat surprised me by stating that the 'Treaty of 1891 had lapsed years ago, and that therefore he was not bound to adhere to it. I pointed out to Tr M Highness that although in Article SC. twelve 3^ears* time limit was mentioned the Article, in my opinion, only meant that the Treaty was subject to revision after IS years and * ~ 1 after IS months f notice • I have since observed that the wording of the protocol of February being given, by either SCta 1892 is somewhat different and seems tc modify Article SS a little. partv , s there was no ques- tier, of the Treaty lap sing? and in any case, so far as I was aware, no formal notice had ever been given by either party, .fis Highness replied Kr # thatt&gt;aat» the question had been discussed in Major Grey f s -time ~r.l nctice Tor revlnior ae well mi certain prcposais tor alteration had been given by him t»o lAa.jor Grey # I answered that I had no Knowledge ot any notice being given but would look up the file .and coimmicate further. L *~ 1 have looked up the rile or the case and rind that tncre was evidently some discussion between His Ifijhress and Major Grey in 1905, and there is an Arabic note or certain alterations which His Highness desires to be made to the Treaty» There is however no formal notice on record, and tne last paper on the rile is Pajor Grey # s letter Ho # ICS dated the IGtn Apri 1 lie J, in which he ss^ys that negociations with I-is Highness the Sultan, in connection with the revision or the Ifuscat Commercial treaty should be delved ui^til the conclusion or tncbse now in progress regarding the French Flag arbitratiai settlement. The matter seems to have rested there, and apparently the Sultan has made no gi&lt;n?. from that day to this. He certainly never mentioned the matter to me till November 3rd, but he now talks as ir the delay in revision is rather a grievance. 6# '' Ir h: y letters I have pointed out to Tis richness that the Treaty of 1881 Is, in my oplnlor, clearly Mrdlrc. ana that the levy of export duty is contrary- to Article 7, but, is .. igteess adiierejj to nls opinion, vide his letter dated 18th noveraber. I went to call on His Highness thin morning bo talL over this matter, hut found him suffering fro:;, fever, so could not do more than ma;e a few remarlrs and leave. I intendeu. to point out to His Highress that it is a serious otep on his .pari- to impose these duties contrary to tiie Treatj'/ and to make another effort to get him to modify his orders. As I was unable to do this, I think it better to report, tae ttacie matter by tnia mall to save furtlier delaj/. 1 have intimated to British subjects on the Eatineh Cogwt that they should ir the first irstarce refuse to pay the duty, and then if the auatoms authorities do not allow the goods to be ex- porteiexpor-bed, t»o :pay wder protest* obtaining a separate receipt/ from the Customs Tor all bum so paid. the question or the rev is i or ot tae Treaty arid the present is not in lay opinion a good, time to deal with the matter # 'but it cannot 'be helx)ed it His Highness insists. The acute phase or the Arms Traffic question has followed so quick upon the Hacue award, that there has not 'been any very favourable opportunity of settling the question of revision. If we could arrive at some arrangement with France regarding the Arms Traffic question perhaps the opportunity could he taken by both Ocuntrietc revise tueir Treatie s with ' . 8.- In the meanwhile, I bee to aslr for instructions as to what action should 'be taken, in regard to the new export duties, and also whether the pour parlers between His Highness and Major Grey in 1906 are to be considered as equivalent to a notice for revision of the 1891 Treaty, as His Highness appears to think, or not. Muscat and Mutrah are not affected by the new exr&gt;ort duties, the interests involved are not very large, there are a few Hindus at 3uweykh and 3ohar, and a certain number of Kaoias at Kriabura and other ports. The imposition of export duty liowever without the concurrence of the British Government, appears to me an unwarrantable act on the part of His Highness, wh&amp; should, I venture to surest^ b0 required to cancel his notification levying the said duty. 7.~ It seems probable that the Sultan will now press I have etc., r (airbed) .

Tiie Political Ager.t &amp; F.Z.'fs Consul, M U S 0 A T. After comp 1 iments. We humbly beg to bring the following facte regarding * ashur' to your kind notice. At first we paid 2 pice per Jirab (date-leaf bag) of dates, both 'Zahiri' and 'Hajri' . Later on, we had to pay 4 pice per Jirab and then at the time of exporting dates to the north, another 2 pice per Jirab were levied, thus making a 6 pice ashoor per Jirab. The local Batini dates were free from ashoor, but were charged with * zakat' (tax) at 10 fS, being actually taken 10 goonis' out of every 100 when dates were prepared. But they (Batini dates) were then free to be exported to any ports without further duty. Recently however Eis Highness the Sultan of Muscat has issued orders that all sorts of dates should be charged .Ut. with a uniform 5 ( p ashur duty, when exported to the north. This involves a great loss to us. We beg to say that if the Sultan wishes to change rates of duty from what those have been from the times of his forefathers and wants to levy a tax of £ then we pray for the removal of the old taxes, far we are poor and cannot afford to pay two-fold duties; the new 5 Jo and the former 10 or the 4 pice or 6 pice per Jirab, We may state. Sir, that all the neighbour^ifgdports of His Highness the Sultan, namely Suweylrh, Masnaa, Hark a, and others' &amp; \ others are not pa^'ing more than one duty oT Bp, If it is brought forward that we have 'been payitig the former rates ere now, we beg to say that we paid 2 pice per Jirab only when i 'v exporting to northern ports. We ma#' aooept to pay the 5 ft ashux' in case the former 4 pice or 6 pice per Jirab is dis pensed with. We cannot afford to pay double rates. % Further, when dates or provisions are sold in the bazaar, the ashur is paid ty the seller. The buyer does not pay anything. So when we buy (those things) we should not have anything to pay. It is clear that things (goods) change hands frequently but the duty should not be ta&amp;en each time after it is once collected from the original seller. As we explained above, the ashur on the Batini dates was 10 till now but His Highness the Sultan now wants this too to be made 5 ft from all, .Arab as well as British subjects. We will pay if people of other places will pay at this tvate, but we too pray to be exempted in case Arab subjects are. We pray you to refer this matter to His Highness the Sultan and hope to get Justice from you and the Sultan. (Signed). HABIB bin FAMED. ABDULLAE bin MUHAMMAD HABIB GHULTO bin EAJI. QFQLIM bin ALI.

We pray that we may have to pay 5 56 duty on goods imported from (the inside) the 'Zahirah' places and from H HaJar M ; that the 4 pi^e per Jirab duty may be removed and discontinued. The price of one jirab is half a dollar. Those goods and provisions which are bought by British subjects from the market, dates, ghee, wood and lemon, are already charged with duty, then why should a fresh duty be demanded from British subjects buyers, when they carry (export) them. The Muscat usage should be Enforced, viz when things come in (are imported) the usual duty is charged and « then there is nothing to be paid when they are exported 4i&gt;o other parts of the country (Oman).

I have had the honour of receiving Your Highness' letter of the 14th November (11th Zil-Qaexi) regard ing the new duty on the Latineh Coast. In the first place I beg to observe that I received a complaint from some British subjects regarding the new dutie on the Eatineh Coast before I received any copy of Your High ness * notification on the subject. On receiving the complaint I at once sent the Agency Dragoman with a message to Your Highness on the subject, and it was only after I had done this that I received on 10th September a copy of your notification of August 50th (24th Shaaban lbP.8). I then made some more enquiries from Khabura, but when I heard the result Your High ness was away. I awaited Your Highness'returr in order to have an opportunity of discussing the matter before making any report to Government. On your return I lost no time in point ing out to Yout? Highness that in my opinion the export duties were not allowed by Articles 0 and 7 of the Treaty of Commerce of 1891. It- will be seen from the above that the duties were levied before I had any opportunity of seeing the notification much less of accepting it, had I the power to accept it - which I have not got. In regard to Your Highness' remarks about the time of the Treaty having expired, I beg to call Your- Highness♦ attention to Section 26 of the said Treaty in which it is writtenwrit/ten: 'After the lapse of 12 years from the date ir which the Treaty shall come into force grid or IP- months* notice given by either party, this Treaty shall 'be subject to revisio etc. etc•' I would observe that, so far as I am aware, the prescribed notice for revision has not been given either by the British Government or Your Highness, the Treaty therefore is still in force. In circumstances, therefore, it is my duty to request Your Highness not to levy export duties until I have communicated with my Government so that the terms of Section ? of the Treaty may be complied with.

From, To,, cr . c- • r Y /ith reference to trie correspondence ending with my letter No. 1541 dated November 27th on the subject of the Sultan's desire to revise the Coirunercial Treaty I think the enclosed translation of a sort o;i note&gt; which the Sultan appears to have handed to Grey in 1905 embodying his views, may interest you. The Sultan says that he still wishes alterations on these lines. It will ^e seen that a great many of the sugges tions made 'by His Highness are not things which require to ^e mentioned in a treaty at all, and others could '^e settled locally. Paragraphs 1, 4, 17, 19, 22 and 25 appear to ^e the important items. The Sultan's principal desire is to get an increase of Customs rate and wharfage, ^ut I do not think we could agree to this unless the Sultan agreed to reorganize his Customs on a satisfactory '^asis with Indian Customs officials in charge. In any case the Sultan would have to get the French and American Governments to revise their treaties; he thinks they would agree if we did. Of course if the Sultan would only agree to reorganize his Customs now, he could get&gt; a great deal more return from the 5 Tariff thfen he does at present. Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.I.E.,C.S.1.

The first and foremost thing in this note (Treaty) is that no foreign subject, British or otherwise, shall deal with the tribes (people) of Omsai, 'by sending to them goods, nerchandise or money except after infom ing us. And should we choose to disallow it, we would do so in time of war. If anyone sends it (goods or money) without our knowledge, we shall not 'be responsible for its return. Seems unnecessary. No one does interfere. 1 iyjp'CcoOf J vyvu- S.

Insolvency should ^e proved 'before Punch. A limit during which cargo for transhipment may remain in the Custom ^ House without 'being tran- % shipped could ^e fixed. Perhaps ground rent could 'be charged after 15 days as in Persia, r ' L tL to charge duty on merchandise according to the rates of the town (Muscat^?) and not on the original value or kind (character) thereof. 7. British subjects should at present (?) have the 'benefit of living, without any condi tion in the whole territory of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat arid in protected (peaceful) places so far as possible. 8. And it should 'be so, that should any of the subjects of the foreign Po?\rers make a Will, regarding his property, on (in favour of) His Highness the Sultan, His Highness shall 'be the trustee and the Consul shall have no ques tion in (nothing to do with) that property. 9. If anyone should claim his dues against a Muscat subject who is poor (insolvent) and has not the wherewithal to satisfy such claim, and his poverty and inability to pay the claim be proved, then he should not be imprisoned or punished. And if he has a father- son or brother (his relatives) these are not to be punished. 10. Regarding Transhipment. The privileges of transhipment that have been granted to mer chants should be given to the representatives of mail companies, etc. and these should be subject to the rules that affect the merchants, and the tax (duty) should be charged from them after the known limit (fixed period of time ?). For instance if merchandise be received from a foreign company under the name transhipment and be not removed during the period fixed for .the merchants, then the Company should have to pay the tax (duty ? demurrage ?) and expenses. Ax idThis is supposed to 'be done at present. € Similar to 'cabotage pais 'in Persia: There seems no objection to this • &gt; And if goods ax'e removed from one ship to smother we should have no objection to it. 11. It will 'be necessary for the owner of the transhipped goods to inform the Customs (authorities) before the goods he landed in the Customs (House), and when goods are (once f J landed in the Customs, the same cannot he fought or sold until it is removed therefrom. 12. Should an owner wish to take or send goods that have 'been once charged ¥&gt;rith duty, to any place in Oman, he should obtain a certi ficate of exemption from (further) duty. The Customs incur some expenditure for the merchant in the way of salaries of clerks and supervisors; ko we would like to levy some- thing (on such goods). For example, if a man want to send some goods to Gwadur and these have ^een previously charged the duty, he vfouli obtain an 'exemption certificate' from the Muscat Customs to (for) Gwadur Customs gratis: it is proper we should charge something (a little) for that (certificate), 15. The British Government have agreed and persuaded us (to agree)that there should be no hindrance to the transit of goods. Accordingly the Customs give certificates so that there may e periect facility in landing and convey ing goods. The Government (British) have added the words'total absence of restraint (hindrance / I in conveyance,' 14, The ships and 'Baghlas' that come to the Muscat harbour are not liable to pay the fees called 'anchoring fees'. li ft JThis would hamper; ^trade arid cannot, I &gt;-hink 'be agreed, itl I think we should allow high duty on cheap spirits. The drunkenness in Muscat is very '^ad. (\ 15. The income tax. levied 'by us from our subjects should not 'be interfered with 'by British subjects; nor should British subjects give our subjects any money beforehand, nor purchase any property before they (Muscat subjects) should pay the entire tax. And for this reason, British subjects should not buy any goods (purchase any property) from our subjects without our' permission. 16. Goods that are sold in the market '^y auction are (should be ?) subject to tax and rent (duty ?). 17. Wine, opium, tobacco and all the intoxi cants (stimulants) as well as those things whereof stimulants are made should be liable to greater tax and duty. 18. In the ninth condition (Article) the ^ 'Words 'Muscat ^azaar' should be retained for the sake of exposition (expressiveness). 19. The question of Administration of Justice (the law court). Every plaintiff must purchase 'Warqas' of suits (forms or legal paper ?) from the No fees are charged to Arab subjects in our ' .'^ourt, for which a fixed percentage shall be /*-purt. I think H.H. , $ ght be allowed to charge fees, if he char ges Arab subjects only in cases ?fhen reco vered, ' m very many no result is ever achieved charged; and also on documents of rents and de'^ts. If the paper is not a Government one, it shall not be considered reliable (genuine bona fide) except those of a previous date. 20. The Question of Weights. Weights shall be specially marked for by the Government (of His Highness ?) for(use v among) our subjects as well as British subjects' there be no Government mark (on any weights * \ A iiweights) these shall not' 'he (considered) reliable Cbona fide) and the user shall '^e prosecuted. Could ^e arranged for locally. % This could only &gt;&gt;e agreed to if we had some guarantee that the money would 'be spent on the improvement of the Customs House and/ of its arrangements. If he gets all his goods he should pay all the duty, but he should not 'be called upon to pay duty on goods pil fered 'between ship and shore, as this is due to gross inefficiency of Landing Contractor who is Sultan's nominee. fit 4 'tP 1 ■ 21. Merchants of the town leave their goods on the wayside add in streets: the Government shall not 'be responsible for the safety thereof Bub (on the other hand) merchants should keep their goods in their godowns. 22. We should charge something on every 'mndle (consignment of goods) that comes here as fees for the wharf (wharfage) in order to improve and reform the Customs. 2S. When goods are (once) landed said it is not known if they should be returned, said the duty has been charged, then should the owner want the duty charged to be refunded the refund shall not be allowed. 24. When goods are lost between the mail and the land, and the owner claims his entire goods from the custodians ^ut wishes to pay less duty: why should the owner pay less and demand thw whole goods from the Superintendent of Customs ? 25. Will the exalted British Government oblige us with 6 instead of 5 per cent duty? L.S.P.HO. 530 of 1911. British uosidonoy and Conaulate-Ganoral, Buahire^ 5th iiaroh 1911.

From our own point of view it would have been convenient if the discussions preliminary to revision could have been postponed for some time longer, in case any adjustment of the Arras Traffic question and understanding with Franca should be achieved in the next few months. As, however, the Sultan has now himself present ed his formal request for revision, and promises to inform us of the changes he desires, i presume we must proceed with the nego tiations • o« Judging from a rough memorandum of the points on which he was anxious for revision, which he gave the Political Agent in formally in 1905, and which he now wishes to treat as a basis of discussion^ it would appear that many of His Highness^ provismnn. al desiderata are either unsuitable for inclusion in a Treaty or will prove possible of elimination after preliminary discussion. Subject, therefore, to the approval of the Government of India I am instructing the Political Agent to proceed to discuss these proposals with His Highness, and in due course to submit the residue in a suitable form for consideratiom by Government.

My experience of .is Highness and ihdeed of hoc genus oane, and yours too 1 expect, is that the .ore-cut and dried the fom m which they see things the easier they are to deal with. You doubtless have an Arabic copy of the existing treaty - or, if not can borrow hie hlghness's, and if you put up article by article ' to him in the form I auggeat, I do not see how he can well re fuse to do the neceaaary. It was never my intention to suggest r\ n V T T71 \ Major S.G.ivnox, G.I.E., Political Agent, Muscat.that you should ask him 'to fix a day for the discussion of the treaty', as you write. What I raeant was, get each article ready in parallel columns one by one so that His highness can see at a glance (i) the text of the old treaty, and (ii) the difference suggested by us, and can then add a third version showing the article as he wants it, without altering the ori ginal form more than necessary. After the exchange of a com- munication or two through your Munshi, ^iio I suppose sees him every day as of old, if there remains any further point to dis^ cuss with him or talk him into, go over and see him; make sure• that he understands at all events obvious objections which put his suggestion out of Court (such as the provisions of the French or American treaties), and after reducing his views to their final shape, record or get him to record them in a third column and post the article to me with your own views. Then take up the next article. There are good many articles which he practically does not want to alter at all. In others hp wants innovations which one will want to know the effect and object of before being in a position to report to Government. If necessary I will come down when you have put up all the articles i« there seems anything in regard , to //hich a talk with him or you tfould be of use, but it is of no use my doing so until matters have advanced further than they are now. I do not altogether understand your apprehensions regard ing the possible'denunciation' of the treaty by the Sultan, The contingency does not seem to me to come within the view of practical politics, in the first place, as I read the treaty, hehe has at present only given notice for revision, and would have - to give a fresh notice and another 12 months t warning before he could tear the treaty. But as a matter of fact, what would such a denunciation amount to ? He has got other engagements with us which we no doubt have every intention of seeing respecteclj ( and 1 should say if he were to do anything so theatrical and ridiculous as to say he denounced the treaty, he would forthwith : lose his billet. There is nothing to prevent us that I see from • i deposing him and putting up some one else, in the first place, no doubt, we should stop his subsidy and give him an ultimatum as we did before. Similarly if he wastes time unduly over the discussion of the revised text, we should I presume, tell him that he can de- • lay as long as he likes but that meanwhile we should enforce adherence to the terms of the treaty. ^ou will gather from the foregoing that 1 should not ap prove of your asiiing him the question, or requesting the pro mise contemplated on page 2 of your letter under reply, or of your taking up that line in any way. Please try and tackle him article by article as 1 have suggested if you can devise no better means of arriving at the necessary result; 1 am sure it is not the least use, especially • in this weather, attempting to attack the instrument as a whole. 1 send you my copy of his proposals and your notes with rough pencil marginal notes in case they may be of use.

Ipointed out to the Sultan his proposal ^ ^ that W/came to me as a such a complete surprise that it wou^d be necessary for me to ask for instructions from my Government At the same time I earnestly endeavoured to to dissuade H^H from that must be but a useless attempt to denounce the agreement and which could not fail to render his motives highly suspicious to Hs H.M.s Government. Although the Sultan seemed quite det ermined, and in no way inclined to take your advise, I persuaded him to allow mo to consult you before taking this momentous and disastrous step. During the interview His Highness expressed his dissatisfactio^ at our policy of leaving him to alone to cope with his own internal troubles. As this step seems to me to have completely altered the position I have thought it best to consult you and suspend negotiations. Necessary clerical work is well advanced and they can therefore be resumed at any time . Our relations wore friendly if not cordial throughout the interview. Knox.© hi Telegram, From - Cox.

It was Your High ness who gave formal notice of a desire for revision and you will remember that at the end of your letter of 15th Jamadi- el-Awal to the Political Agent you wrote: 'If you desire to communicate anything concerning the I 'articles of the Treaty, I request it ray be done in 'detail before tlie end of the period mentioned', Jithout comparison of each old article with each new article and without the exchange of explanations, it is not possible for me or Government to understand the meaning and effect of some of the changes which Your Highness desires, and I feel sure that although it is troublesome, the only sa tisfactory way of arranging the draft is to take each article one by one. I should like to have come down myself and spent a few days at Huscat, so that Your Highness and ...ajor xvnox and I could go through the articles together, before I expressed t my T 'y via.va to Govorrunent, but I was anxious before coning to iooeive replies which I awaited, from uovernment regarding certain other interesting matters.

(Oonfiden- tial), dated the 6th Decemher 1905,) and you have already instructed the Political Agent to resubmit proposals 'based on the British revised draft, and you anticinate that many of the Sultan's suggestions will be eliminated bv an exchange of views. pending the result of these further negotiations, it may be well to indicate the changes essential to meet the objectionable alterations in the draft proposed by the Sultan, and it is necessary that the earliest opportunity should he taken by the Political Agent to discuss them with the Sultan, unless His Highness is prepared to accept the British draft practically as it stands. In so doin? the Political Agent must be guided in matters of detail by his own judgment; but the following statement of the views entertained by the Government of India on the wider issues will indicate the amendments to which his efforts should generally be directed. 4 As regards Article I, it is understood from the Political Agent's observations, that no difficulty is anticinated in remedying the defects brought to notice. Article 11. The Government of India entertain serious objection to the use of the word 'kings' and to thethe omission of the protection clause. Tt is desiraWe t adhere to the phraseology 'subjects of His Britannio stv ' x x x and 'subjects of Native States in India under the protection of His Britannic Majesty' 1 , The insertion of the words 'the subjects or citizens cf Maskat or Oman' is held to be important, and should be pressed in order to ensure national as well as most favoured nation treatment. His Highness 's emendations of 'most favoured nation' treatment in Articles II, III and TH are obscure, as observed by Major Knox. Ivery effort should he made to secure the adoption of the ordinary form of most favoured nation clause in commercial treaties. Article III. The ' ,after r erini9sipI1 al1 ' 5 publication from either side to the other' should be omitted. x- Eo such restriction exists in the French treaty, and in re -adiusting British relations with Maskat, British interests A t, thera cannot t. plMWi on . footinc intorior to that of Prance. Article 11. The omission of the addition except v x x shall be after permission' places x x A should be urged. Failing this, the addition may be nted, the reservation suggested by the Political Agent acce inin note (1) to this article 'being made. The words 'Under the same conditions in all respects as subiects of their respective countries'*, which have been omitted and which are referred to by the Political A cent in note (2) to this article, should be included in pursuance of the attenrnt to sec^ue national as well ^ most favoured nation treatment. The Government of Inoia approve the remarks and suggestions in note (4) that there should be separate articles dealing with intoxicants and warlike material, and that the maximum duty should be named. The nrecise phraseology of the article dealing with warlike material may, however, be appropriately reserved until the instructions of His Majesty's Govern ment are received regarding the proposed negotiations with the Sultan for the general control of the arms traffic. The Government of India attach importance to the sentence * the coa sting trade of Maskat and Oman shall remain o-oen to British vessels'- which has been omitted, and it should be pressed. The last clause of this article which is commented on bv the Political Agent in note (6) cannot be allowed to stand. Its retention would defeat the cbiect of the treaty. irt icl e, ! L ^ i P ! ! ^ ! i: I ^ — m ■ Article 7, Iv the interests cf British trade, a time limit is necessary, and action should 'be taken on the lines su^e?ted by the Political ipent in his notes to this article. xirticle 71. It is observed that in Article 71 of the revised draft treaty armroved by His Wa^estv's Govern ment, the word 'custom' was omitted before 'duties or taxes' in the second sentence of that draft, A .pT &gt;arontly the intention of His Highness In his present pronosals is that -navment of irrmnrt dutv should not exermt cnnods x •&gt; 1 v i O from some form of local taxation: this is opnosed to the intention of the revised draft above referred to # If the Sultan adheres to his noint, it is a matter of preat practical importance in the interests of trade that the taxation should be specified in the treaty and action should be taken as proposed by Major Knox in note (3) to this article. The clause su^ested in note (1^) should likewise be inserted. For the rest, the Government of India concur in Major Knox's suggestions. Article VII. r ihis article is very obscure. The last sentence stultifies the first and must in anv case be deleted. It would also be desirable to omit the second sentence and to amend the first as nronosed by Major Knox. Articlet irticle VIIT , The exr^ressioTi, M HiR Ma]«sty' i f a? l2&gt;o a 'nT )licable to the Sultan is open to serious obiection in a treaty with the 5 r i^i s h Government, In varioup narts of this draft treaty, and in all earlier British and French treaties, the expression used is ^His Highness^, The Sultan should be advised to adhere to uniformity and to the stvle of ^His Highness', under which his indenendence has been fniaranteed. The word ^ approve' in this article is preferable to ^^^0^^' and should if possible be substituted. Article IX. Provision is made for the payment of dutv in cash, or in ^oods, or in produce should it be possible to levy the tax in this way. A. reform of the Maakat currency has been recognised in the nast as a measure of considerable importance. Something may be effected in this direction bv rendering duty navable in coin which is legal tender in British India, unless payment is otherwise arranged by common consent of the trader and the customs authorities. This T &gt;art of Article IX should therefore be altered to correspond with the wording of the draft revised treaty of 1905 already referred to. In view of Maior Knox's remarks, the last clause of this article should also be recast ^o as to apree with the revised draftdraft treaty above referred to. Article X. r ihe efficient execution of the provisio referred to in notes (1) and (2) of the Political Ae-ent would depend entirely upon the good will with which His Highness might carry them into effect. His Highness •hould be reminded that the British Government are animated with a sincere desire to foster trade with Maskat, and that for this purpose the draft article as accepted by His Majesty's Government is most suitable. The provision regarding standard scales and weights should also be inserted. The proviso nroposed by Major Xnox in note (4) of this article is unsuitable for a treaty and might if you consider it desirable, form the subject of an exchange of notes. Article XI. It is very necessary that the pro- visos mentioned in note (2) by the Political Agent should, as far as possible, be removed. The wording of the nrovislon regarding salvage is obscure. The correct expression is 'rights of salvage' as in the existing treaty. Article XII. The second clause is not at all clear. It apparently sets un a claim of reciprocity as to which there is nothing in the existing treaty or intte revised draft of 1905. The Government of India agree with Major/ 6 ^ Major Knox that the clause is thoroughly objectionable. Should, however, it be eventually considered desirable to grant reciprocity as to which your opinion is invited, ! iriimiHnrnm imTTBiifrrrriiTi'X' fTri-yirr I am to point out that the general provisions of section 238 of the British Merchant Shipping Act, and section 63 of the Indian Ports Act, provide for surrender from British territory without distinction of country 'on proof of desertion 1 , and an Order in Council would be necessary to apply the former section to Maskat, Before, however, coming to a decision on this point, the obscurity of the article should be cleared up # Article XIII, The Government of India concur in the Political Agent r s remarks. Article XIV. The words M in which the lex talion?^ x x x is necessary' should be deleted. They do not appear in the French Treaty, The provision made at the end of this article re garding protection to British subjects in the service of His Highness is impossible. No such provision exists in the French Treaty. Article XY, In the interests of commerce, it is essential to maintain the provision in the revised draft of 1905, that the English Bankruptcy Law should apply. Article/ 2 A f *&gt; D mes Article lYl. The exception, as it stands is ♦ undesirable. The substitution of a clause on the 1; of clause 2 of Article m of the British revised draft would be useful, ihe Government of India concur in Major Knox's comments. Articles mi to HI and mn. Call for no re»rk=.

THE NEW TREATY. w t Article 1. \U . / f' /' // f\r tts'i € 'l&gt;&lt;- ' \ ' ik The treaty concluded between Th e British Gover d ment (1) and Saiyid Faisal bin Turki bin. Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Maskat and Oman. And this treaty, now concluded in the year 1339-H ., Cancels all treaties that preceded it , (2) and at the time of exchange of ratifications, ehall replace them. Note .—His Highness has here confused pre amble and first article. 1 anticipate no difficulty here in bringing him round to our point of view . As regards underlined portion (1) I pointed out to His Highness tnat the direct treaty with His Majesty was an honour that be should not lightly forego and he seemed to accept my view. As regards underlined portion (2) I pointed out to His Highness that the wide terms of th is cancellation rendered it impossible to acce pt, and he eaid that the defect would be remedied. I t li 'j / » « r i't&amp; Q fzrrytvO * .M j '. j LA fide*)*. JUL C&lt; 7 Article 2, That, in virtue of this treaty, the subjects of the Indian Kings, (1) who have treaty relations with the British Government, shall be considered as subjects of the aforesaid Great Government also. And all subjects of the British Government shall be permitted to enjoy, throughout all the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat with reference to commerce and navigation and the exercise of trades and professions, as in every other respect, all the rights, immunities and protection of every nature which they possess, or enjoy, or which may be practised in future they shall enjoy them, (2) or which may be granted in the future to the subjects of the great Govern ments and their subjects: and, especially, there shall not be upon them duties, taxes, or conditions, or responsibilities of whatsoever nature more than what may be upon others (3) or upon the subjects of the great glorious Governments (4) and their people now or in the future. Notes .---(I) I think the use of the word a Kings' and the omission of the protectio n clause will be considered decidedly obj ectionable Seditious Indian advisers seem t o have been at work here and it is a piece of gratuitous imperti- nence on His Higbness's part to criticize o ur relations with Native States in India which i n no way concern him. (2) Arabic here obscure, and neither my -Dragoman nor myself could follow it so a~ K 11 I 4 L2 make an exactly logical English translation. It should, however, present no difficulty in alteration and correotion. It is probably careless drafting' and noth ing else. (3) Rather vague. I do not yet know what His H igbness's views may be on the interpolation the subjects or citizens of Maskat or Oman.'' It seems to me to have its inconveniences in conjunction with the wide w ording from &lt;( as, in every etc., whatsoever nature and I should be glad to know if its retention is considered of serious importance. (4) His Highnesses emendation of u most favoured nationof which value is doubtful. I should propose to tell him that ' most favoured nati on and its translation, are well known diplom atic phrases of which every diplomat t horoughly understands the eignitication, and that it would b e dangerous to alter tbem. His Hig hness asked me the meaning thereof and seemed suspi cious about it, thinking that it referred to Christian Governments and was a slur on non -Christ ian Governments. I explained to him that this was not the case and think there wilt be no difficulty here. Article III. Each of the two High Contracting Parties acknowledges (1) tbe right of the other to appoint Consuls in its territories, after permission and publication from either side to the other, (2) wher ever the interests of commerce may require the presence of such officers, and the aforesaid Consuls shall be considered, in the country in which they reside, on the footing of the Consuls of all the glorious Governments (3) in their rank. Each of the High Contracting Parties further agree to permit his own subjects to be appointed to Consular offices by the other Contracting Party: provided always that the persons so appointed shall not begin to act without the previous approbation of the Sovereign whose subjects they may be. The public functionaries of either Government residing in the dominions of the other shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are enjoyed within the same dominions by similar public functionaries of other countries.(4) Note (1) ^ reciprocally ' omitted, but practica lly allowed for, m the way Article is worded in the Arabic. I could probably arrange for a closer adnp- tation to the English. (2) Most objectionable interpolation. P rob ably introduced with the very object of defea ting, when occasion offers, the privilege established by the Article. (3) fide note (4) to Article II.

A rticle IV. There shall be perfect freedom of commerce and navigation between the two High Contracting Parties ; and each shall allow the subjects of the other to enter all ports, creeks, and rivers belong ing to the tiwo Governments, with their vessels and cargoes except places in a state of war or m which there is danger to life or property on account of want of security in those parts. j^ en the entry to those partiThall be after permission. (1) And to the subjects of both parties there shall be license to travel, and pursue ^ commerce and trade, whether wholesale or retail, in each others dominions, and therein to hire, purchase or possess houses, warehouses, and shops, and stores, and lands. (2) And also it shall be lawful for the \ s ubiects of the two High Parties (3) everywhere, that they shall buy, barter, sell—and that direct, or by means of agents-all kinds of merchandise, articles of import, or native production, for sale in their respective countries (3) or for transport to foreign countries, except intoxicants and warlike ma terial. Then it is for the Sultan o f Maskat or f^Tlu s''naib the license or pro hibition oi: their ^ thrnr sal e throughout his dominions. (4) And it is lawful to them also that they should consult on the fixing of the price of all such goods and produce with their owner or his agent without the smallest interference on the part of the officials of the Highness of both Parties (5) and to His Hio-hne ss the Sultan is reserved th e privilege and ^^ITln ail that pertains to commer ce and Profits , . . Native produce throughout hia dominions. (6) ta^es — Note (1 ).

Otherwise, at e very Bedouin squable—and it is believed that half Oman is in a permanent state of insecurity at le ast, if not of war, .British subjects might be preve nted from going to look after tbeir families ^T ^nerty when these were m the greatest (iang er. No doubt the real object of the excep- ^T Ts to give His Highness a pretext to oppose niTtrav elling by European travellers, and especially ^^^^anf.TcrP.nts. which he regards w ith the o-reatest fear and suspicion. i T' (2) The new addition is naturally left out, as His Highness did not know of it, when this draft £rea,t.v was prepared. I have so far had no opp 01 '* tunity new proviso. oulty. of learn ing His Highnesses views on this I do not anticipate any great diffi-(. -4- 4 ■i i- : (3) The alteration here appears to be due to offended c&lt; amoui' pr opre' and I see no great objection to i t. ^4) This is a move in the riglit direction, but the exception shoul d nob be pitchforked into the middle of Article IV, where it disturbs the sense of what follows. It should come in a separate article, and it would be better perhaps if one article and the maximum duty named. I would suggest that it mio-ht then ^ ^he kind contem- p|^Gd__in__Articles VJ1I and XIX w ould be the best arrangement to deal with the situation. The difficulties would be great, but not insuperable. The question of warlike material would requir e to be dealt with similarly. It seems t o me that it would be advantageous to h ave an article denouncing the arms trade and expressin g' a hope that a board might be created to deal with this Difficult situation. The objects to be pursued being a high increase of the duty and strict control of both sale and e xport. (5 ) The paragr aph re coasting trade is omitted. Remarks in note (2) to this article ap ply^ (6) His Highnegs probably does not understand the full significance of b is alteration, and it mar be difficult to get him to do so. He probabl7 misunderstood the paragraph in the old treaty of lb91 and thought it an encroachment on his sovereign rights. I presume that a clause s o destructive of the entire treaty must be a bsolutfilv vetoed. X Aeticle V. British subjects shall be permitted, throughout the dominions of His Highness the Sultam to acquire land, houses and property of every descrip- tion, whether moveable or immoveable, and that by way of gift, purchase, or intestate succession, or by wiH, or m other legai manner, but all that after info rmation to His Highness the Sultan, o r his Naib, and license from them both.

Article VI. His Hignness the Sultan shall be permitted to levy a duty of entry, not exceeding 5 per cent on the value of all goods and merchandise (1), imported by sea from foreign countries into His Highness's dominion s, except intoxicants in which he shall have liberty to take more than th e tax afores aid and to prohibit the sale thereof and to grant licenses. (2) This duty shall be paid at that port in His Highnesses dominions where the goods are first landed ; and, on payment thereof, euch goods shall be exempt in the matter of thi s tax, but should such goods be transferred through* out all the markets and towns, then they shall not be exempt from the warehouse taxes of those markets and towns, (3) And there shall not be demanded from British subjects any import tax exceeding the tax that is levied on the subjects and citizens of the greatest nations' countries (4). (5) and (6). As for the merchandise and goods, of which the destination is a foreign port, (7) and which are transhipped from one vesssl to another in any of the ports of His Highness the Sultan, or which have been for this purpose provisionally landed and deposited temporarily (7) in one of the Sultan's custom houses to await the arrival of a vessel for reshipment to a foreign port; then, when the merchandise had been so landed , they shall not be exempt from duty, except when the consignee or bis agent; shall have, on the arrival, of the vessel so stated and deposited those goods aforesaid for safe enstody in the custom house and has given intimation that they are landed for transhipment to another ship, and of the name of the port to which th e merchandise is to be exported then they shall be exempt from the special tax, but not from the warehouse dues (9). And. like- wise, those goods shall not be exempt, except when they are really removed for despatch to the aforesaid port, according to the original declaration, within a period which shall not exceed three (10) months from the time of their being landed, and on condition that there shall have been no change of property therein. Sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) as per draft treaty. (4) All goods and merchandise transhipped or landed for the repair of damage caused by stress of weather or other disaster at sea, provided that cargo so landed he reshipped and exported to a foreign port and taken away on board of the same vessel or op another vessel (11). If it is decided that their efforts are in vain, or the loading of the merchan dise is delayed from its vo ya g e in any way whatever , then, if th e goods remain in the custom house by way of r i h y n W i Xr. f, if f i. !6 transhipment, or in other ways, and tlie owner thereof, or his deputy, has not arrived to take delivery of them^ their permission to remain in the custom house shall be for a period of six months, if they are of the nature of grain and perishable goods ; and, if they are of the nature of metals or woven goods which will admit of delay their permission to remain in the Custom house shall be for the period of one year. Then, if the owner thereof, or his deputy, comes to take delivery thereof, he shall pay the warehouse tax of the custom house for this period; and, if the owner, or his deputy, does not come within the expiry of this period, the disposal thereof shall be, if be pleases, at discretion and choice of the Saperintendent of Customs (12). Notes—(1) ' of whatever description ' requires to be inserted. Slip of the pen probable. (2) would have to be altered ; ' except intoxi cants and arms and ammunition of which case is dealt with in Articles of this treaty ' would seem preferable. (8) This foreshadows an or ground rent which is perhaps poorly translated by warehouse— tax. It will be necessary to specify the amount of of such tax, if it should be seriously considered? and it would be better that the matter should be dealt with in a separate Article, in which case thi s clause would perhaps best be amended as follows : '^and, on payment thereof, such goods shall there after be exempt, within the Sultau^s dominions, from all other duties or taxes levied by, or on be- half of, the Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be designat ed except such taxes as are specifically described hereafter in the subsequent Articles of this Treaty Another rendering- (4) Note (4) to Article II. of ' most favoured nation ( 5) Vide note (2) to Article IV. (6) His Highness has been so anxious to ex plain that goods for transhipment must pay ' ground rent ^ or warehouse tax that be has left put the clause that governs this Article from this point to the end and so makes nonsense of sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (4). This, I feel sure, is only careless drafting. The intention is clear. The amendment m note (3) above will remove this difficulty. (7) Verbal discrepancies of no importance. (8) Clumsy drafting which I trust to be able to remove as unnecessary in course of discussion.

It would read better if the final clause s aid &lt;f shall be forfeit to the Muskat Government ^ but we could not prevent His Highness ma king tbem a perquisite of the Customs Superintenden t if he chose. It would be advisable to put in a clause that One month before suc h goods are declared forfeit to the State in the ca se of perish! able goods and three months ia the case of ordinary goods, the Customs Superintendent m ust give notice in writing of his intention to decl are such goods forfeit to the State and to the British Consul^ stating nature of goods, quantity , weight, number, marks and all information likely to lead to identification of owner, and this irrespective of whether he has reason to believe that th e goods unclaimed are the property of other than British subjects or not/' Aeticle VII, No article whatever shall be prohibited from being imported into, or exported from, the terri tories of His Highness the Sultan except intoxi- cants (1).

Merchants are q uite enough under the thumb of the Customs ' Su perintendent as it is and such a provision as this w ould lead to endless bickering and delay s. The p rovision in the draft treaty is ordinary and fair. Article X. Then His Higness the Sultan of Maskafc^ accord ing to this treaty, engages that he will make an arran gement according to his power and abilit y (1) so that the movement of goods in transit shall not be hindered or delayed by irksome and unneces sary vexations and restrictions, etc.; And likewise His Highness promises that there shall be afforded to goods faciliti es for transport as far as possible (T) and His Highness the Sultan shall have authority as to whom he shall appoint as landing contractor (£) (3) (4f). Notes (1). These provisions point to confessio n of weakness and foreshadow an attempt to evade the treaty. I think they should be opposed. (2) . The new provision is probably a repl y to our man y remonstrances as to the scanda lous con duct of the present nominee of His H ighness, Abdul Kad ir, who, besides being a notoriou s drunkard, is at the head of an organised gang of robbers and pilferers of cargo, who call themselve s tall y clerks, boatmen and coolies. I think, how - ever, the phrase might stand quahtied as follows ■ \ ——9 &lt;l but, at the same time His Hiofoness, looking to the interests o£ tra de and the importance of the protection o£ troods fr om pilfering between ship ancT shore, hereby promises to attach the greatest weight to the recommendations and re- monstrance? of His Majesty 's Consnl; when base d on the proceedings o f a committee of British traders residing in Maskat.'^ (3) It will be noticed that the phrase ' and that standard scales reside ' has been omitted, pro bably through inadvertence. (4) While we are dealing w ith this matter, it wou ld seem advisable to include this proviso ' whereas the attention of His Highness the Sultan has been drawn to the many complaints, alleging that car go, eBpecially rice, destined for other ports, has, in course of transit, been pilfered. by JVIaskat coolies and others, working on board British steamers, His Highness hereby engages that, on the re quisition of a British mei'chant, supported b y His Majesty^s Consul, he will provide a suitable guard of his own sepoys, under the command of a competent official, in the app oint ment of whom and in regard to the number o£ sepoys despatched on this duty, His Highness will give due weight to the representations of the B ritish merchant and Consul. The duties of th is g uard will be to arrest and make oyer to His Highness, for prompt and condign punishment, at the infliction of which the British merchant or a re presentative from His Britannic Majesty's Con sulate shall he given the opportunity to attend, all vagabonds and unauthorised persons, Maskafe subjects, found loitering on board a British mer chant steamer and especially all persons caught on board in the act of pilfering cargo. It is, howevei', understood that, in such a case, no arrests will be made except at the instance of the Captain of the vessel or the British merchant or their ageuts. Such sepo ys will be paid direct by the Agent or Captain of the steamer concerned a daily wage of Ks. 2^ per diem and t he otficer in charge a daily wage of Us. 5 per diem, to be borne by ttie merchant making the r equisition, so long as the aforesaid guard is employed on this duty/ -7 Article XL British vessels entering a port in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan in distress shall receive from the local authorities all (1) aid in their power ( ^) to enable them to revictual and relit so as to proceed on their voyage.

Should a British vessel; wrecked on the coast of His Highnesses dominions, be plundered, the authorities of His Highness shall as soon as they come to know thereof imke all possible efforts (Z) to render prompt assistance and take measures to pursue and punish the robbers and recover the stolen property to th e utmost of their ability (2) and those things shall likewise be subject to rights of jpestogHtion.

Note (1) 'necessary^ omitted; probably slip of the pen. (2) The cumulative effect of all these p rovisoes looks ominous and, as if His Hig hne^s's officials intend to plead inability in most cases and so evade their responsibilities under this Artic le.

(5) t his is not understood and in any case is badl y drafted as it does not state clearly, though it may mean ^ take refuge op board a British ship or in British territory. Verbal discussion with His Highness might ma ke this clear, but, in any case, I doubt it a British Courti could accept the startling attempt of th e last clause to do away with the effects of the carelessness of the Maskat captain in not drawing up a proper written engagement with his crew . Article. XIII. British subjects shall, as regards their person and property enjoy, within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, the rights of exterritoriality. And, as a result of that, the authorities of His Highness the Sultan shall have no right to interfere in disputes with British subjects amongst them selves, or between them and members of other Christian nations; such questions, whether of a civil or ciitninal nature, shall be decided by the authorities of the British (1) Consulate.

And (3) the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, and also the hearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims or disputes between British sub , jects defandents, (4) is a right reserved to tae Consular authorities and their Courts and remov ed from the jurisdiction of His Highness. The proceedings and final decision in such claims, should the plaintiff be one of the subjects of His Majesty the Sultan shall not be co nside red legal, except that they notify His Majesty or his naib that they may be informed as to the case and the fixing ot the orde r therein (5). Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness or of any non-Christian Power not re presented by a Consul at Maskat, and a British subject in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan, or some person, specially delegated by him (6),12 The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, be considered legal, unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his substitute to attend at the hearing and final decision. Notes. (1) an obvious b lunder , but only re- quires to be pointed out to be corrected. (2) I am inclined to think that this should not be entered in the treaty. Such a case must be extr emely rare and action by the local authorities could only be called for in some grave emergency, •wh en 1 have no doubt the local officials could be tms- te d to take immediate steps. If they really confined the action proposed to friendly in tervention in quarrels for the best interests of all, when no British authority could intervene, they might be confident that the British Government or officials would not complain of their c onduct, and it would do no har m that they should know that their con duct was likely to be subject to careful scrutiny. (3) slip o f the pen probably, but must be correc- ted. (4) bad Arabic drafting but meaning clear and in accor dance with Treaty requirements. Easily corrected . (5 ) unnecessary ; such cases are never taken up except at the in stance ot His Highness, who could keep himself well informe d of all that goes on in our Courts, where proceedings and final orders are public. Ob jectionable only in so far as it means an increase in office work, whioh could hardly be dealt with b y present vernacular staff, consisting of one ma n whose time is fully occupied. Interpo lation must be due entirely to amour pro pre ' and, il the concession were granted, it is extremel y doubtful, if advantage would be aken of it. In Bahrain, where a similar privilege of joint session and attendance is permitted, my ex perie nce led me to the conclusion tbat attendance was regarded as a wearisome co rvee. Such officials as His Hi ghness could produce would understand little of our procedure and know perfectly well that justice is im partial and that, in ninety-nine case s out of a hundred, there is nothing to complain oL (6 ) The omission is important and must be opposed, I understand that Consul seldom objects but think he should have the power to do so in the c ase of a notoriously corrupt or incompetent judge Article XIV. Subjects of His Highness the Sultan, or of any non-Christian Power, not represented by a Consul at Maskat^ who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, shall enjoy the same privi leges as British subjects themselves. Should they be charged with having committed a crime or serious offence, in_ which the lex talionis, according to the traditio ns of of Shara' law is necessary (!) &gt; they shall, on sufficient evidence being shown to\ 13 r Z&gt;r &lt;s^/ i-K' •C^ ji . v r/C J i^- &lt; r '' t ' V^y^Cn justify fartlier proceedings, be handed over by their British employers, or by order of the British Consul for trial and punishment, a ccording to lex talionis. And, likewise, British subjects, when they shall be in the true service of His Highness the Sultan, shall enjoy tihe same protection which the subjects of His Highness the Sultan enjoy (2). Notes . The alteration is a poor one for the simple and salutary proviso of the draft Treat y. The use of the Arabic word , instead of the more usual and milder words for punishment looks to me omino us and we m ight find a useful British s ervant, caught in a petty thpft, having his hand cut off, or mutilated, or subjected! to some othe r barbarous form of torture . (2) Unless we want to have Maskat made an Alsatia for fugitives from British justice in India, and the rather shady characters who already sar- round the Sultan grow bold in wickedness, im agin- ing that they are protected by the Sultan against t he sanctions of British criminal jurisdiction) w e must oppose this provision, it is a matter o f com- mon knowledge why it is necessary to protect Britis h domestic servants against the local authorities in Oriental countries, but a similar rep roach has never been laid to the charge of British officials . Article XV. Should a British subject, residing in the do minions of His Highness, be adjudicated bankrupt, the British Consul shall take possession of, recover, and realise all available property and assets of such bankrupt to be dealt with and distri buted according to the provisions of the customary (1) Bankruptcy Laws. Note (1). A very poor substitute. I do not imagine that any one knows what the customary Bankruptcy laws of Maskat are; it is, however, notorious that Maskat bankrupt subjects are famous for their ingenious devices for successfully evading the just claims of creditors. Article XVI. Should a subject of His Highness the Sultan resist or evade payment of the just and rightful claims of a British subject, the authorities of His Highness shall afford to the British creditor every aid and facility in recover ing the amount due to him. Except that, should it be verified that he is in indigent circumstances and unable to pay the dues, then he shall, in tha t case, be decreed in indigent circumstances (1) and his relatives shall not be responsible for him (2). In like manner, the British Consul shall afford every aid and facility to subjects of His Highness, in recovering debts, justly due to them from a British subject. Notes (1) and (2). The invariable replies g iven already to the just demands of British subjects . The office files are full of such lying pretensions and I have two cases pending now be lore me, in one of which a man, possessing a date-garden , pleads inability to pay a trifl ing ^ebt not one-tenth of its value and is consistently supported by His14 Highness and his officials. In the other, a debtor, possessed of similar valuable property at the time ot a l oan not eighteen months old, has disposed o£ that property by a friendly family agreement and the creditor is apparently powerless against this palpably shady transaction.. Cheating bankrupt s are common everywhere; but this cynical support of their fraudulent devices is most discreditable to Hi s Highness. To legalise these flimsy excuse s would be dan gerous in the extreme . (a. fide note (2) to Article IV. Article XVII.

There may be some difficulty in getting him to accept from the semi -colon in 3rd line to full stop of 5th line, which, in present state of Eastern opinion, may be considered insulting. I presume this customary provision must be insisted upon though I am personally inclined to think this is unnecessary. No other difficulty should present itself over the acceptance of the rest of this purely formal Article. Article XXIII. Should also present no difficulty, though it has been omitted by His Highness from his draft. G. 0. B. P., Simla,—No. 0.94 F. D-7.7-11.-80-P.C.A.TELEGRAM. P. To FOREIGN SIMLA . No.M.13.

On the other hand in all our routine correspondence in the past, the the declaration og 1862: and in all instruments except the Order in Council of 1867, the Sultan is always referred to as Sis Highness: and the p^osition is understood to be the same in the case of tgz the Sultan of Zanzibar, No doubt the wording of an Order in Council is primarily a domestic matter concerning the British Government and its subjects^alone, but the point being as I have atsHaat# explained atiready at issue in connection with the Treaty negotiations now in temporary abeyance, I trust the present opportunity will be taken by Government to conaider the point and decide which form is to be used.&gt; ■ , A V /I oai I ( ill n / /' Please see my official letter of todajs's at u.^t 0 , is : o 6o0 &gt; oit the subject of the SultaTi of Muscat *3 desire tonbe referred to as w His Majesty « in the new commercial Treatj I should like to explain to you my reasons for not referring therein to Foreign department Letter Ho 1506 E«A . dated 17th Aug -ust 1911 $ and to the view expressed in para 4 of thatletter f under the head of Article 8 . You will note that my letter of 25th June 1911 , to which the above was a reply , was a demi-official one , and that the letter from Knox to ne , to which it gave cover , was also demi-official : ana that in forwarding it with its enclosure , X made it plain that X had not yet ;iad time to scrutinise the latter , and that i meanwhile considered prima facie , that the matter was not at '—j a stage at which Government could satisfactorily deal with it . Consequently X did not suppose or expect that the papers would te be taken and coramantednon officially without some further exchan -ge of comnunications . A close examination of Knox's notes , which disclosed a rood many flaws , confirmed me in this view as you will see from my demi-official telegram of S th July 1911 , When at Calcutta last November , in the course of discussingnsome iifghan question with Clarke , the case of the Sultan occurred to mei! me and X asked Clarke incidentally whether it had escapednhis nctic notice , when drafting this letter { No 1506 E.A.) that the Sul- -tan had been referred to as ' His Majesty ' in our Order in C-nm -clX and in the United States Xreaty with Muscat .

I now venture to trouble Government with the request tha this question may be dealt with and decided separately on its merits, for the reasons which are explained in the fol lowing paragraph^. 2# The Government of India will recall from my telegram ■ o M 13 dated r a skat November 16th 1911, that during my visit to Haskat at that juncture the wits of His Highness, rajor Knox and myself, were too much occupied with the details of the rarehouse schene, then in course of discussion, to be able to attack satisfactorily and simultaneously the re vised draft of the Commercial Treaty. An arrangement was t therefore com© to with His Highness, which I confirmed to him in writing and reported to Government whereby he agreed to consider tho existing treaty operative for another two years&gt; during which time we were- to discuss the revised versionvorsion as opportunity and leieuro permitted. ^Inco tiiOHji until lately, ciafcat has had little respite jfrori the incidence of various quoatione arising out of the Ware- house negotiations with France, and Indeed it rm» originally hoped that a ©atiafaotory aettlersent of Issues tyith Franc© would era thia have left us a clear field for the discussion of the detaila of the new Troaty, and that thi^ couir» best be left, if it be poBelble, until that much deDired d^noue*- mmt had materialized* rime is paeaing however, and the Anglo-irenoh negotiations show no sign of reaching finality. Meanwhile there is a lull in the currency of Arms Traffic issues at .'askat and it may be practicable now to take up the thread of the Treaty piece meal • In contemplating this coursei I ain confronted with tne ques tion of the Sultan's title# Kiardly an Article of the Treaty can 00 diecuaaod without this point arising at every turn, and the Government of India will realise that it would be very convenient, not to say important to us to know what the decision, or at all events what the provisionally decided view of Government on this subject is, after consideration of the praotioal grounds and arguments for and against, 3.

Sir Please refer to the correspondence ending with my letter Ho.493 dated the ^oth March ^949 on the subject of the prolongation of the Conmercial Treaty. This treaty terminates on the ioth February next. I wouli propose a further extension for a period of one year with wording similar to the existinr prolongation. There is no doubt in my mind that the treaty needs revision especially with regard to the tarif, which is at present five per cent. This will entail however the revision in addition of the treaty of 1833 between the United States of America and Iwuscat, and of the treaty of 3,844 between the French Government and Huxcat. Article 3 of the American treaty and Article 10 of the French treaty both lay down five per cent as the maximum duty which may be levied. The tarif question must also be very careful^ considered in relation to the various tarifs levied by other states bordering on the Persian Gulf. The Bahrein duty is also five per cent according to the treaty of 1861. The rate of duty in Koweit I do not know. On the other hand the duties levied in esopotamia and Persia are quite different, fiiis bearing Ct &gt; point has also a considerable on subject of the prevention of smus^lin^. It would I venture to surest be of ^eat advantage to all concerned if the customs arrangements of the f 7 t • 1 Yt V\ i ; y { y I I u 5 'i, .'x - ■- ^ . ' ■ ' • • Brits Arabian Btates of the G&amp;lf could be reviewed tiiiB year with the object of arriving at a definite policy and if possible a definite agreement which will unify the arrangements through- -out. It will be seen that it would be impossible at present satisfactorily to revise the treaty owinc to the many considerations involved. Prolongation for a period of one year will admit of the question bein^ carefully examined, and the wording of the prolongation admits of the treaty being replaced by another before the expiry of this period.

S, « ^ - f ri »/ - Your D/0 of the 11th Instant re^arlin^ the reriaion of the Goramercial Treaty, The question of the revision of the treaty now raises a large number of points # anrl with your perraission I want to put them before you. You will probably think that I am an awful trouble anl am raising a number of unnecessary hares, but if you think the sitiatlon worth consiiering from the point of viaw expres .se I in this letter it will orobably na / j some eiiect upon ^uo ^ot ..e oai.7.■ • o.._ vna j ^ &gt; i want ■&gt; /xe , ?ir3t of all as '.oja:'!. a f ;/ poi .^,5 in jl. treaty if it is rerisei, I am sure you are right now as to the inairisability of raising the tariff. In the first place as long as Muscat has treaties with other countries we cannot raise it as regard ourselves witnout fjosing the position of most favourei nation. It seems scarcely worth whije entering into all the diplomatic trouble which would be in vol . i, and the questions that might be asked, for the sake of possibly increasing the income of this insignificant state. In tne second place sucn action wouli lose half its point if itw was not accompanied by the raising of tne tariff in the other states of the G-ulf, In the third place I doubt if it is worth while risking tne possible outcry from Oman which has peculiar ideas on tne subject of all customs, I think also it might be necessary sligntly to alter some of the clauses in the draft treaty of 1904 in the \ ^ light of our experience. I refer especially to the clauses dealing with the estimation of the duty, and I would suggest the insertion of a clause that while affirming the fact that export duty is not permitted at tne same time mentioned the rignt of the Sultan to levy his zakat on gaadtx produce grownn uis iominion® ani brougnt to tne coast towns. This iaight in the future save a lot of trouble. However to get back to the real point of tnic letter. We have arrive! in Muscat as you know at a rather interesting situation. To put it very shortly a bankrupt rule embodying really no aiministration atall, anl practically not functioning except to give some lecision in a case involving a British subject, ani that only unler pressure, was supported at great expense by us frora certain annihilation by the Omanis. At the same time we male no attempt to improve the actual administration, on the grounds that it was not our business. This was however indefensible a a else why did we give it armed support, pay it and save it ? This has now bean replaced by a rule that is Arab at least in personnel and conforms in a small degree to the requirements of reasonable administration, while it just j ills along financially and provides its own defence, instead of our providing it. But the real head of the administration declines to interest himself in any way and is an absentee as long as possible, and the driving force is the influence of the Political Agent, wxiose advice must be asked and followed on all questions of importance. It is almost unnecessary to add that this advice under the conditions of the last eighteen months has had to be given frequently. While all these events were going on the absence of the Sultan y /as if anything beneficial, it was possible to get a move on, and he and his father have always been regarded as the source of all evil by a large section of their subjects. Now a form of constitutional rule, if it can be so termed has been introduced, ought not the Sultan to take more interest ? In other words for the moment we have extricated ourselves and the Sultan from what was admittedly a bad show. i ; 1 i i f }]—~ wnlcn ii a?e everj proa| je?Eof beeomlnK worse, bu t tlioudUi theoretical ■/e hava re dueel our xxxxxx In U j-fdrea c e to al ao at nil. we_ ^ xiaTe incr^aej.J.neyjt abl/ our Interfere nce In alalnl »tratlnn, ^l-5°-,qH£_^ I'Oilsiblllty eBpe olally ord n to the attlt.!:^ of Q^ht we not now to ca ll a ha lt, ana mak e him accept thle re^onslblltty for the future.?

Our position is (l) We have done these tnings go any further (8; We dont want to. xaxxugaaxaxflt. Even our loan la ful^r secured on tne subsidies, (3) We want the Sultan to accept responsibility, which is morally and actually his» iO the bultan it seems therefore, must be brought home a realisation of his position, which bluntly is as follows ;' %h . tC A, p, m . * \ &gt;'■ ** - ** J-j * \ .Afr . X ' ^ .Jr VV' .a) The subsidies are personal to M b . Were he to abdicate ^ they would automatically cease, and be would be a peniless man as ne nas no private property atall, and even if his cessor wei e oo promise him an allowance we would in no way be responsible for it, l b) Should in tbe future the s^ate fall into disorder in its finances or otherwise, the subsidies are pledged to us for the redemption of our loan, and they will automatically stopped. It is to be presumed that his ministers will be able to pay him nothing under such circumstances. ^cj Though hi,-, state is now self-supporting and h fe s a defence force, it still only exists through our moral support. Should that be withdrawn it will crumble to dust at once. And we will withdraw it should tne Sultan persist in his attibu^e. or should ha -ot act in accordance with our wisnes in important matters and not continue the reform of his administration. (a) V /e have more than fulfilled, and at great cost our duty towards him. It is up to him now. He must be the responsi- -ole ruler or his state. If anything goes wrong now we accept no responsibility. It is his alone. (•} ffe have made peace for him with tne tribes. The maintananc of this peace depends on tne tribes knowing that we support hia and the agreement which was made through us. All I would ask is that the Sultan should be made to understand these important points thoroughly. He is no fool, but he seems to think that the British Empire is only ,00 delighted to take on fresh responsibilities and to administer places, quite regardless if it pays us or not, or if it is for our own benefit. I would not ask tne Sultan even to reside a fixed period of the year in Muscat. I would leave it to him, but I would insist that he is personally responsible for all important measures such as the appointment ~~of minibtera anl iiign officials, for knowing tue finknciAl conlition, I'or fixing salaries, for lookimg after his family, for being acquainted with political events, etc, ani I would ■J-tau kt. U' ^(jWXA, &lt;^4. «*, hjj C'i'\ dt£.C iM/tCf-t **f' tuttlcci see that everybody knew this. At present he never even answers the queries of his ministers on any subject. Once we have cleared up the position and attitude of the Sultan, we are then in a position to revise treaties or do anything else we like. But it seems at present that there is the danger of an artificial situation developing, amixxssKxiKsaiiaxxjaaxKg The moment is a critical one. One phase is over and another beginning. The second phase may develop into what the world regards as British protectorate unless we make tne situation clear, though niaK actually at the moment it is mucn less like it than it was before. And this development will take plac« so to speak against our own will and simply as the result of circumstances unless we seize the present opportunity, which is unique, for settling the matter once and for all.

Xn Colonial Office, , r ^ rP) opy. Downing .street, (E 9440/3037/91). 17th August, 19 21. 33841/21. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Churchill to request you to inform the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston that his attention has been called to the Note renewing the Anglo-Muscat Treaty of 1891, for one year from the 1 ith February, 1920. 2. It will be remembered that the position of' the self- governing Dominions in relation to this Treaty has been the subject of several discussions during recent years. v5. At) long ago a^ 1908, a despatch was received from the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia, asking that notice might be given of the termination of tnis Treaty (amongst others) in respect of Australia. In view of the fact that the Treaty of 1891, whilst providing for the adherence of the Dominions, made no similar provision for withdrawal, a reply was sent to the Governor-General, with the concurrence of the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, indicating that the matter was one of some difficulty, and that a special Convention would require to 'be made. The correspondence referred to will be found in the letters from this Departmen tjof the 3rd June, and the 1st July, 1908 and the letter from tne Foreign Office of the 19 th June , 1908. / 4. In a letter from the Foreign Office of the 13th September, 1909, it was stated that trie desirability of entering into an agreement to allow withdrawal of the Overseas Dominions in respect of this Treaty was being considered, such an agreement having already been made in the similar case of the Treaty with Paraguay. The substance of this letter was communicated to the Governor General of Australia in Lord Crewe's despatch of the 8 th . .r - 8 th October , 1909. 5. Negotiations were subsequently entered'Into with r to the Austro-Hungarian, Italian and Mexican Treaties (see Foreign Office letter of the 11th December, 1909, and the letter from this Department of the 24th November, 1909), and the Governor General was informed en 3rd December, 1909 that Sir E* Grey proposed to await replies with regard to these Treaties before making any communication to Muscat. 6. The matter then remained in abeyance until 1911, when it was taken up again in connection with the generel arrangements, resulting from the Imperial Conference of 1911, for enabling the self-governing Dominions to withdraw from Commercial treaties. It was, however, settled to leave out Muscat from the arrangements a then initiated on the ground that it was doubtful whether the Anglo -Muscat Treaty of 1891 affected the liberty of the Dominions as regards customs duties, and that the Treaty might De terminat ed at an early date. 7. The question of the Treaty a.^ far as it affected Canada was raised in connection with the Canadian Order in Council of the 16th December, 1913, respecting coasting trade. It is *iientioned in the Memorandum on the inclusion of Coasting Trade in Commercial Treaties, enclosed in Foreign Office letter of the 23rd July, 1914; and in the despatch to the Governor General of Canada of the 7th October, 1914, in the terms of which Sir E. Grey concurred (see Foreign office letter of the,30th September),it wa- stated that His Majesty's Government were of the opinion that Muscat was entitled to participate in the Canadian coastal trade on the most-favoured-nation footing. 8, In view of the above facts it is clear that the continued existence of the 1891 Treaty is not a matter of indifference to the Dominions, and in the circumstances , Mr. Churchill does not consider that the Treaty should b^ further renewed without the insertion of a clause giving to the DominionsTWiT'^ Dominions separate liberty of wi till raw al. 9. I am to request that, if Lord Gurzon agrees to tills course, he will cause such a clause to he prepared in draft and communicated to this Office. 10 A copy of this letter is being sent to the Board of Trade.

The papers received still fail to make the matter clear. If the treaty has been 'aiade applicable' to the Dominions under the provisions o^aist Article and a clause such as suggested is really required, I see no reason «ny i-i should not be discussed with the Sultan at the first opportunity. I suggest a draft (in English and Arabic)- of the agreement to renew the treaty with the desired clause added be seat to the Bombay Secretariat to await my arrival there. If a similar draft of the whole treaty as now desired be sent to me at the same time it i s just possible its accept ance may be secured.
