Vatikiotis interview</dc:title><dc:creator>Vatikiotis, P. J. </dc:creator><dc:date>1973-01-06</dc:date><dc:description>P.J. Vatikiotis was an undergraduate student at AUC from 1944 to to 1948, later going on to a career as a prominent scholar of Middle East history at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London and elsewhere. Of Greek heritage but coming from Palestine, he tells of how Cairo’s history and affordability attracted him, and explains the other reasons students attended, including the inability to enter other universities due to grades and the difficulty of pursuing study in Europe during the years of World War II. Vatikiotis offers a portrait of AUC’s student body in the 1940s, with a focus on its national and ethnic diversity (a minority of Egyptians among Greeks, Ethiopians, and others, including a large influx of Palestinians, all united through speaking French), as well as its religious mix. He also speaks about female students at AUC, typically Egyptians coming from American and English Schools in Egypt, and he discusses the social relations between male and female students on campus, including romantically. Vatikiotis explains how, like himself, most of his classmates made their future careers abroad, AUC being an effective departure point for study and work in the United States or Europe, or in other parts of the Middle East. He mentions the accomplishments of a number of classmates who relocated abroad, plus female graduates Laila El Hamamsy and Wedad Said who had successful careers at the American University in Cairo. AUC’s curriculum is outlined, together with a description of many faculty members, including their personalities, academic caliber, and interactions with students. He gives his impression of the continued Protestant Christian missionary influence at AUC in these years, and how it was expressed. The popularity of athletics at AUC is covered, along with other extracurricular activities like geology club trips and the glee club, plus theater and music performances organized by faculty member Worth Howard, whose parties are also recalled. He also recounts the international roster of musicians whose performances he witnessed at AUC’s Ewart Hall, such as Edith Piaf and the Palestine Symphony Orchestra. Vatikiotis depicts an unsettled era in Cairo, recounting major demonstrations that brought violence to the edge of AUC’s campus, a cholera epidemic, and his survival of a 1947 bombing at Metro cinema.
