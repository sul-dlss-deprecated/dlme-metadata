No.106 C dated 89/10/10. The Sultan has informed me that he would like to visit India for a month this winter inorder to see the Viceroy and for reasons of health. After settlement with the Imam there would seem to be no objection to the visit. He has a special reason for his visit to the Viceroy which he has not disclosed but he will do so if the interview is granted. Telegram p. From political Muscat To Political Baghdad. No.llo C dated 8/11/10. The Sultan is most anxious for a favourable reply as regards his visit to India as soon as possible and I consider that iy would be a good thing if his request were agreed to. If approved details could be arranged later and I suggest January aaxa if otherwise suitable as it is hoped that the status-quo will be settled before the end cf December. Telegram Code. From Political Baghdad . To Political Muscat. No.13943 dated 14/11/10. Your telegram of the 8th November G-ovemment approve visit to India provided settlement with Imam first concluded and ^s directed that the Political Agent should accompany the ^ j - I Sultan* -t British Consulate and Political Agencj Muscat November 26th. 1919. ^ &lt;■% Prom R#B«L«Wingate Esq. Political Agent 9 Muscat. To The Civil Conniesioner, Baghdad. Sir I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.15743 of the 14th. November in which permission is given to the Sultan of Muscat to visit India providdd a settlement with the Imam ie first concluded* The Government of India has also *kMW-rfck« directed that the Political Agent should accompany the Sultan on this visit. In vi ew of the present position of affairs it is impossible for me to give the date of the visit, but it is to be hoped that it will be feasible in January. On this supposition I would ask that a draft programme be forwarded to me by the Government of India as some Indication of what the Sultan may expect. I would refer in tide connection to a latter No.108.C. of the 88th.October 1918 sent by Major Haworth on the subject of the Sultan’s proposed visit last year. Circumstances have changed considerably since then, and His Highness during the last year proved himself bo much more amenable to our advice that I would suggest that during his stay in India he should be treated largely as a guest of Government. The Sultan will only take with him a Secretary and a few servants. I would recommend that he and his saite be given a passage to Karachi on an R.I.M. ship such as the Lawrence. H.E. the Viceroy will presumably be An Delhi and the Sultan would of course proceed directly to visit Hisrf J l r Excellency. He does not wish to stay atall In Karachi or Bombay. It would not I Imagine be necessary for the Sultan to stay more than a week In Delhi, and after that If he could be the guest of some ruling chief for a short time as suggested by Major Haworth, it would be most useful. For the remainder of the period of his stay in India I would propose that a house be placed at his disposal in Calcutta or Bangalore. The total period of the Sultan’s stay In India would a month td six weeks* I can only endorse the opinion expressed by ay predecessor that should the Sultan be treated as a guest the expense would not be great and the outlay would repay istelf many times, and I would add that in the present circumstances he has a special claim to our consideration.

The ClYil CoamlBBlonor, 3ai;dal. I have the honour to invito your attention tho a situation arising from the expressed desire of the Sultan of Muscat Soyid fefcnxlte* Teiaur bln Faisal bin Turk! to abdicate frora the Sultanate* It will be remembered that he expressed this wish verbally In India. The Government of India however decided that he must return to Muscat at the end of three months* Tho Sultan Is therefore due back In Muscat some time at the end of June. At the time that this decision was arrived at I had however ventured to sug&amp;tst that even though the Sultan ehouli return, nevertheless the whole situation with regard to the future of Muscat and his expressed dtire to abdicate should be very carefully considered* The matter Is a very important one and clearly cannot bo onled at the present position. The Sultan will either reiterate hi* wish, possibly pxfcdlak* openly, or he will prove obstructive when he returns* It is in these circumstances that I venture with some diffident to put forward the following views and suggestlona. (1) the character of the Sultan. Sayil Teimur is not unintelligent. Ho is however incredibly weak and incurably vain* Both these characteristics have not made him a successful ruler of an Arab state. His weakness has resulted in his being exploited by liis family and unscrupulous persons and in his being unable to make any headway against the rebellion, whilo his vanity— ; In an Arab country lihara ganlallty an! ^ood mannara toward* hl^b and law alike are obligatory&gt;has alienated many of tuo*a who ara by conviction his rapporter*. In the interior owin^ to the misrule of hi* father and ^rand father which he haa not i iKproved hiMself, he la hated # aiid this hatred lias been t inteneified by iiie cavalier treatment of eheikha and hi a general pomposity refered to above. Ho is not really wantonly extravagant but simply sijly about money# He inherited his father's absurd ideas about his position ani his independence larggly the result of the Anglo-French position in Husoat# Tired of the whole affair arid especially of Muscat he has however now definitely abandoned these ideas and has thrown himself unreservedly on our mercy. As far as character is concerned he never will be a successful ruler. (a) 'he Sultan’s family. The Sultan lias one son Say id Said, about ten years old. He has many brothers, the most notable of whom are Sayid Nadir, half a negrc, and Sayid Hamad, a freemason and vith a tendency to become europeanlsed# The rest and his many uncles and cousins and nephews are quite impossible and may be ruled out# For Sayid Said provided he is decently educated in India not in England, there are possibilities. Sayid Nadir is an intiguer and Is rightly despised and detested. Sayid Hamad is showing signs of becoming a useful member of society# He is by character however unsuite* to the first place in the state. From the royal family therefore there is nobody to succeed Sayid Teimur exoept his son, and at pi’esent he is too young to be anything more than a figure head of the administration# (3) Our policy in Muscat. We are definitely committed to the support of the Sultan and the reform of his administration en the coast. Thai reform is proceeding elowly and with a conoideraldaeasjr# of popular support. Th«* ftr^n^or ws make the Sultan and hi 3 A&amp;fcdni«tratifn # tha iinplar ^ th# solution of the Oman problem, which is no more tlian the problem of a harder line of wj.ld tribe* who never have been controlled, ana whom it would be folly to attempt to rule* Te continue our reform euccecefully wo want akkMOt a pliable ruler* It 1* open to doubt if the preeent Sultan kept on the tl^ron* and in Muscat againet hie will, will prove * pliable* There ie therefore a etrong prima facie case for permitting the Sultan to abdicate* Such a step could not be taken however without careful consideration::of the following point** (1) the form of government which would replace the rule of the Sultan during the minority of hi* son. U) The effect of the abdication of the Sultan and of the form of rule will oh replaced him on Muscat opinion.and ( problems* (3) The light in which any action by u* would be regarded by ouside opinion* (4) The financial ability of the atate to pension the Sultan idbpudM&amp;jcx adequately* A* regard! U) I would propose the formal recognition of Sayil Sail as Sultan acting through a Council of Regency* Such a council would be composed of three or five member* with the British adviser always as a member* There would not be any difficulty in finding euitable men to act in tMs capacity. The veto which the Political Agent can alwaya exercise in all antters of importance on which ha must be consulted is sufficient oafs guard against undesirable action by the Council* Aa regards the effect oc such a step in Muscat and Oman, I conjecture that it would probably be hailed with *&amp; deli gilt* Say id Teimur is not popular and the interior distrust* him. The formation of a council of influential mento r in his staaA, baokei u?i by our support would ba mora •ooapt^bla to all jt^rUoa, and would certainly faoilitata adoinlstration* As ra^ardc (3) X wn not cowpotent to speak # but I would veriture to suibest that wa may allay a *reat a eA x of suspicion by an pan declaration af policy as regards tfusoat* Aa regards (4j I as* satisfied that tna stata could pay t’ae Sultan a pansion of brora Ra*500C/“ to Ra»10000/» per menses:. ThAi! should be sufficient for him and ho would probably be content with this provided he had a little capital in addition which could bo provided by the Bale of dwadar and the &amp;rantln£ of a portio of the proceed* to hin persoanally. Thar remains the question of the education of Sayid Said. He should net remain in Muscat, and possibly a Ciliafs , College in India would bo the beet training. All then* au&amp;saations are tentative and I submit them with the greatest diffidence. Prom what I knew of the situation here and of the character of the Sultan X am however euro that some action will ha/e to be taken by ue an this question. In view of the Sultan*• return at the end *f June it would be advisable to be prepared for eventualltie*. * That the Saltan should return for a short time Is certainly beat, but the shorter that time the better. If it ehould be found possible to arrive at a definite policy and te communicate it to the Bulirtan before hie return and to get him to agree to it, which will be adt difficult matter unless it pronicos him th* prospect of early retirement, our position in Muscat will be much simplified.

Ae requeetel Ly the Foreign Secretary yesterday I put up the following brief note on the position bin Faisal, Sultan of Muscat, who had come on an official visit to H.E. the Viceroy in March, had asked H.E. at that time tnat he mignt be permitted to abdicate. This proposal was however not entertained, and H.H. was informed after his long residence in Muscat and owing to the state of his health Government had no objection to his remaining three* months in India, but that at tne end of those three months he must return to Muscat. at I had however ventured to suggest that the whole question of the Saltan deserved serious consideration as I was sure that he was determined not to return if he could possibly help it, and tnat in consequence he would twist and turn wnen tne time came. for Karachi. On arrival there ue however informed me that he delaying his return a short time owing to the raonso?n. I at once suspected that this was but a prelude to further excuses and this was confirmed a few days later by the receipt of a letter from him in which he stated t.*at the state of his nealth forbad his return for some time. This letter with my comments upon It has already been communicated. the news of the death of the Imam and suggesting to him that he might wish to return under the circumstances, he at one# fled to Kashmir. There he is at present, though ne states that he is going to Dehra Dun on the 34th August, and from there apparently Intends to proceed to Bangal &gt;re and from tnere eventually to Karachi. of the Sultan of Muscat. The situation at present is tnat Sa/id Taimur At the time that this decision was arrived H.H. left Agra at the end of his three months Finally on his own ministers wiring to himMeanwhile the actual government of the gtate had been carrlel on till about two month* ago by the wazir, Capt maccollon, anl when the latter took leave by the wall of Mattrah as acting wazlr. The latter is atlll In charge. The actual minor details of administration are working well under this arrangement, but as has explained In an attached note such a system though quite unobjectionable as a temporary measure which w,h» all that it was originally intended to be, cannot continue indefinitely for obvious reason*. Should the Sultan not be able to return for health or other reasons, or should his absences be likely to be rather froquent in the future, or even should he return ( for in this cane he h^s neither the wish or the ability to gevem) it is clear that some sort of Government must be set up which we can leal with officially and which will not be suspected as being a puppet in our hands. The question of the Sultan is therefore one of considerable urgency. We mayy assume the following facts, (1) The Sultan still wish s to abdicate if he should be allowed to do so, (2j If he should not be allowed to d^ so, ho will still ondeavour to evade his obligations as regards actual personal rule, will resile as little as possible in Musca$, and will leave all work and administration in the hands of his miniate* relying cn us to keep them in order and to advise thorn. (3) In character he is not unintelligent. Ho is not peculiarly vicious or absurdly extravagant though he is a fool In money affairs. He hankers after the Joys of civiliza- -tion as represented by India, loathes his own country and is detennined to be as idle as possible. , (4J In his own territories he is neither feared or respected, while in the Interior he is of course hated. There are three courses open to Government under there circumstances(1) Kt* may b« allowei to abiicato, and hia Bwall son ;’.ay ba put In in his place with a Council of Regency. As regards the local situation this courae naa much to recommend it. A fairly able Council couli be formed, and such a form of rule would certainly Inapire more confidence in the country which has still unpleaeant memories of tne incompetence and oppression of the present Sultan and his predecessors. The interior may bo disregard -ed, they will accept no form of rule and nobody wants to force any form of rule upon them. There remains the question of how such a step would b&gt; regarded by outside opinion, and whether it would not be open to hostile critlclBm. On this point I am not competent to express an opinion, and presumably much would depend on the attitude of the French, and on the course of events in MesopoLumia. (2) He may not be permitted to abdicate, but he may be allowed to exist, openly for reasons of health, largely an an absentee euler, residing as a matter of form a certain number of months of the year in his country. The govemmeh of the country as in (1) would be carried on permanently by a Council of Rtrgenoy. There is really littlo difference between this and (lj, and possibly the deciding factor would be whether this scheme ould bo subject to less hostile criticism. (5) He may be forced to go back, and to utay 3.n his country practically permanently. Tne difficulty about bhia is that I do not quite see now »*e are to do this In the case of an independent ruler who says he Is sick. At the same time there would not be much advantage in such action, as the sole result would be to have a discontented drone on the spot Instead of a contented one only tne^e occasionally. In all three alternative* the Sultan will have to be paid a privy purse, and in all three cases ho will be of no off* whatever to his state. The state can pay him aboutPvfc • .’00/• p»n* Hlfl prasenca is not necessary luuneiiately in Muscat, but the formation of a permanent council of Regency is necessary as soon as possible* whatever course i* aken. I wouli there fore suggest that I should Interview H.H. and pui the vl-r-s of Government before him. It will then be possible to make him, if he should not be returning once, appoint a council with the necessary Instruction*. He could do this by letter.: r. tVin/mta, ’dlitic.' 1 Agant, lr»ak«l # has g&gt;om me a telefrar* recoivad from Maakaft r«T&gt;eatin^ the 3ul&gt;stanoe of fb# plotter trow 3beikh Isa to him. flhie letter indicates that t^e ^rd ns of tte 3ult^n f TfhiQh have been tJe real subject of dispute, have been handed over to the Sultan's s/rentn ,£nd that the rebels ere nor; ready to come to toma,which will presumably be those already corcnuni&lt;rted to them last December. 2* r. ffinfjato is now anxious to return to :.'.aakat at once to meet the representatives of the tribes and to settle fho terms finally, but before doing so he must see the :5ultan,who has been summoned from Xcahmir to moot hi at A^bala.

Wingate has therefore boon ins trusted by me to at to to toe 3ultan that the Tbritish Oovomnont is willinf to assist him in the negotiations between his State and toe rebels und in the continued reconstruction of his finances on toe following conditions. (1) 'Smt if he persists in his wish to live away from his State rs much as possible, he shall spend not lass than five months every year continuously st Inskat.

D.F.3 According to tho instructions contained in F. 3. note of 3 rd 3epteraber I interviewed His Highness the Sultan of ruscat in the Circuit House at Ambala today. His Highness had arrived the night before with his Secretary Khan Banadur iihmed Shubeili from Kashmir, and o dng to his habit of travelling incognito had not had a very pleasant time in Ambala, obtaining accoTmodation in the Civil x l.ilitar;y Hotel where by chance I found him. His Highness has changed greatly in aopearance wearing (habitually I understand) luropean clothes and a sheepskin are of course heinous offences in the eyes of the Ibadhi sect the 1 difficult and trying. His Highness showed a mule lilse obstinacy in sticking to his original request to abdicate at CTv all costs, and on iiiis point as are the subject of appointing an administrative council instead of a British iazir, very . considerable persuasion had to be used. His attitude was a combination of terror at having to return to Muscat even for a day and of a pathetic desire to get as much money out of his State as possible for his own personal use. By playing on these two obviously incompatible points of view it was oossible to secure his consent to the important points demanded in the F.3»s note, though it will be seen that he has put in a request that his yearly stay in Muscat should only be a couple of months. In view of his attitude I considered it advisable to get him to write fez. He has ala) trimied his beard. Both these actions( 6 ) ms a letter explaining hie attitude and the steps tie intended to ta«B to arrange for an administrative council. This I enclose for reference. He also gave me for personal delivery to the Wali of Mattrah who is in charge of the state at present a letter containing his instructions on the latter point. It will he seen that in his letter (1) He accepts the condition that he nwst reside a portion of the year in Muscat, hut aslcs that the period may he shortened. It was impossible to move him on this point, and in view of the great difficulty I had in securing his consent to the others I let it pass, compromosing that his acceptance should tate the form of a request, it being left to Government to decide. Personally 1 venture uhe opinion that it does not much matter. He is determined to do nothing, and nothing useful can he done hy him. He might he made to stay there.. A reply is necessary on this point (2) He has given orders for the formation of an administrative council, and has placed all rotters e.uapt those mentioned in (3) of f note in its hands, thereby fulfilling conditions (2) and ( 5 ) of F.S. note. This council is to continue in its functions even when he.is in Muscat. | ( 3 ) I did not think it necessary for him to put his acceptance of condition (4) of F.S. note in writing as this follows autorotically, and he ^eoauae almost hysterical at the thought that he should ever even contemplate returning to Muscat permanently. ( 4 ) He Ibs given me a free hand in the negotiations with the Cronis. It was very important to have this in writing, and owing to his hatred of them and his sense of pride it was a very difficult point to gain. s ( 5 ) He ho ietf Government will continue to assist him.(6) He aiinounces his return to Muscat for Novetn’oer. This is suitable. (7) He asks for a ship to take hirn as this will be his fomBl return. If one is available and going up the Gulf there would be no harm in granting this request. As regards his letter to the Wali of Iviattraii authorising the twtiftf institution of an advisory council, no coiiment is necessary. The ras onsibilit,/ of inaugurating this council harmoniously is the Political Agent’s. The whole interview only’’ confirmed the impression of the utter uselessness of this vain and idle puppet. Only outside political considerations of the highest importance can permit him to renBin even as a Sultan only in name. Ottor a i s ed, b y IIdu rin g ^ .iateg M . (1) His orlw purse . This has been reduced from Rs.10,000/- to Bs. 5.000/- p.m. and he was anxious to have it raised first again. He was told by me that tiieijnst financial year under the reforms would end on JOth September and that the position of the State would be reviewed and he would be informed accordingly. (2) fcvadur . Without my mentioning the subject he brought this up and te«ad anxious to include Gwadur in the i-luscat customs control. This will solve the Owadur oroblem from the Muscat point of view - which was purely the problem of why this lucrative source of revenue should be used as a , private estate. This will greatly increase the revenue of tiie State and do a away with the regime of Mohamad Remoo. This change of control is to take place on the Sultan’s return. (3) Mcogr ^ti on , Q.f Mid . /^bwml j&amp;,hia_M.lE. He was very anxious about tills. I replied that I would in no way ccrmut Government on this point but that at his request I would bring up the point before Government. what is at tiie bottom of his mind in this case is that- if anything should happen to hirn we should not aopoint one of his brothers. Sayid Said is his only possible successor hut whether we could give such an assurance is beyond rqy purview. He is anxious to have a permanent pied a terre in India his mind seems to Sun on Dehra Dun or Bangalore. This is prooably desirable if he is going to reside over half the year in India. It is at least better than his wandering buy incognito over the whole peninsula^. Kis idea is to a small house. He calculates that this with furniture will cost him Rs. 60,000/-. I informed him that the state finances could not possibly bear* this charge this year. He then asked if Government would lend him the money - presumably with the extra security of the Gwadur custorrs. I replied I had no idea and did not think it very likely. Probably the best reply would to say that he should rent a house for a year pending the result of the next financial year with Gwadur thrcwn in. (5) A very minor point - he wants a license to buy a sporting rifle and 40 Q cartridges. There were othor points about allowances to certain members of his family which he asked me to arrange with his administrative council which it is unnecessarf to mention. He expressed considerable apprehension at the non-return of Captain MacCollum. His fear was that he himself mi^it be badgered and that though as a puppet Sultan in name he did not mind being controlled by us, he did not like the idea of being controlled financially above all, by his relations. He was told however that this subject could not be reopened and was somewhat reassured when reminded of the financial control exercised by the P.A. under the terns of the loan. He unfiuestionably wished to throw the \tiole burden and . ♦ responsibility on the British Government, and this transparently obvious wish of his is an additional proof of the necessity for not caunitting ourselves further.x Date omitted.

My brother tiadir will be the President of the Council, but he will have no special authority (independent of the Council) except with the concurrence of all the 4 persons, each of whom will have equal vote.

After complimentLS . fiith reference to the conversation we had at Umballa on the 8th September 1920 on the question of my return to iiaskat, I be&gt;y to say tliat I have alroady informed you before that j. do not at all wish to return to iiaskat owing to the unsatisfactory | state of my health and because I ara always ailing at that place. I also explained this, through you, to the Government (of India) while I was at Delhi. You have now informed me that the govern ment cannot agree to this except (on condition) that I made some other arrangements in this matter. Agreeably to the views of the Governmont, and in order to comply with its wishes as far as I can in regard to my returning to Masicat for a time, I (propose to) go there for two months every year. You have told me that the Government desires that I should go to Maskat (and stop there) for 4 or 5 months every year. But I find it will suit me and my health better (if l did) as I have stated above, and I have no doubt that the Government and His iixcellency the Viceroy will not agree to see me suffer, (fray) communicate this from me to the Foreign dec re o ary. I also beg to inform you that in regard to the affairs ox my Government, I have written to the /azir at Maskat, Muhamaad bin Ahmad bin Nasir, to the effect that I nave appointed 4 persons to work in consultation in the office oi too /azir, as is done at present at Maskat. The 4 persons are - Juhammad bin Ahmad bin Nasir, Vali of iatrah, ray brother iiadir, Shaikh Bashid bin Aziz and Zubair bin Ali. They will have executive powers for the good government of the country, but they will have no authority whatsoever to interfere in matters oonoern- ing me personally or those of my family, nor shall theyusurp the State or the lands belonging to the State. I beg you will kindly oommunicate this to the Government for its acceptance. I have no doubt that the Government will accept this (arrangement) and instruct the Consul at *4askat to refer all matters (direct) to the i/izarat of my Government after the date of this letter. I have understood all you have told me in regard to ray I MM rebel subjects among the Oman people and I thank the | Government (for it) and no doubt you will look into the matter yourself. I have already in the past given you my views on the question, and I fully realise it is an important matter. (But) the Government will deal justly in this important matter and is to be relied upon in its opinion on this question. I beg of the Government to continue to extend its help and favours to my Government, as it has done in the past, and I trust this will continue for ever. I (propose to) leave India for iiaskat at the end of Moveraber next in order to spend the time I have agreed to do there.

To The Hobble Lt-Col• A.P.Trevor C.S.I. C.I.E. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter No.267 dated the 10th February 1921 on the subject of the finances of the Muscat state. The world wide trade depression and the fall in the price of silver to which reference was made in the above letter have been acutely felt in Muscat during the last two months. The revenue of the state has been correspondingly affected, and the figures for the months of February and March show receipts of Rs.63,190/- and Rs. respectively and expenditure of Re.62,970/- and Rs. • Included in the expenditure of March are payments of Rs.8000/- on account of netrol for the motor boat for more than six months and about Rs.sooo/- in connection with the levy corps. I do not anticipate that trade will show much if any improvement during the months of April, may and June. During July the date season begins, but again owing to the complete lack of rain this year the date crop in Oman will certainly be a bad one, it is estimated by local opinion at not more tnan 75^ of last year*s # and the price of dates will equally c rtainly be low. From July onwards It nevertheless may be anticipated that the income will average a lakh or more a month. For the months of March, April, May and June it la however more than probable that the income of the state will not average more than Re.50,000/-. This is very serious, but tills falling is due to causes which are world wide andMB • (jrf: wbloh Bix nonthu a^o It waa not aasy to for#*##, Tha running «xp«ns*« of the atate, excluding th# repayment of the loan now average about Rb. 64,000/* p,m. With the arrival «x* of the levy corpa, and with the extra expeneee of providing the pereonnel of the boat and of mor# cuetome officials, should no reductions be r?»ad* in the present scale of monthly charges, the monthly expenditure will be about Rs, 80 ,ooo/-, mbt* means that the running expenditure for the months ’larch to June will exceed the Income by about Rs.1,30,000/-. In addition to this the state on the 1st June h^s to pay Rs.4fl,?40/~ towards the second instalment of the loan, and. during these months Ps.36,500/- for the arms and equipment of the levies. In other ^ords during these four months the expenditure of the state will exceed the insome by about two lakhs of rupees. At the end of February the state had in its treasury a balance of R#.4*1C,000/*. There will therefore be sufficient funds to meet this extra expenditure. But the greatest econoray is called for and I have addressed a strong letter to the Council of Ministers urging them to cut down all expenditure to the minimum possible, 3y the dismissal of the useless M asker w ard of certain surplus personnel at other ports it should be possible to save some Rs.2000/- p.m. In vlof the undoubted financial stringency I however consider that the state is called on to make other economies. The only method in which thl? can be don# is by reducing the Sultan*# personal allowance of Rs,10,cco/“ P*ni. Ur^ur the terms of the loan the p*ym*nt of this allowance is conditional upon the ability of the state to make the payment. Should th* finance# of the state be momentarily embarrassed Cov-' , r r n*nt has th* right to ask the Kueuat Government to reduce this p^reona,! allowance. During 1920 this step was taken upon my advice, but owing to some misunderstanding the TTazir gave to His Highness ar undertaking that the amount withheld should be paid the end of the year if it was found that the state/ if oouli afford it, I riay« repeatedly informed the Sultan in conversation that the payment to him of his personal allowance depends upon whetner Government considers that nie state aann afford it, and he perfectly understands tne situation* I would also in this connection call attention to Memorandum No.i?6G-B-A dated the 1st December 19S0 from tne Govornment of India in to# Foreign and Political Department, and to tne correspondence which passed between the Sultan and the Political Agent when the loan was granted* I would therefore recommend that the Sultan be informed that from tne let May 1921 his pereen&amp;l allowance will be reduced to Rs.oOOQ/- p.m. as long as he resides in India due to the present financial position of the state. I put up a draft letter to be sent to His highness for your approval• In view of the necessity for despatching tnie letter to tne Sultan before the end of April, and at tne same time of informing the Council of Ministers as to tue decision taken, I should be grateful of early orders. I have the honour to be Sir, your most obedient servant I.C.S. Political Ag«ht, Muscat*/iq After compliments. I ailress Your on the subject of the finances of your state. During the last few months a period of great trade depression has come over the whole world. This Is largely the result of the late war, and It is to be hoped. In fact It is sure that this stae of affairs will only be temporary. At the same time due to other causes the price of sliver has fallen. In Muscat this means that the dollar can no longer purchase as much as formerly. Finally there has been no rain this year, and this as Your Highness knows means that the Oman date crop will be bad in comparison with former years. are nervous of trading to any great extent and in many oases have not the money to do so. income and finances of v our Highness’ state. Indeed the effect is already noticeable. In spite of a more efficient organisa- -tion during the months of February the income only just balanced the expenditure, whifcfc during the month of March it among the most profitable months of the year At the same time the state is compelled to incur heavy initial expenditure in outfitting and paying Your Highness new tro&gt;ps, and in other essential services. After consultation with Your Highness ministers I have calculated that during the four months from March till the end of June, if no economies are made, the expenditure will exceed the income of the state by about two lakhs of rupees. By careful management the state treasury has a balance of about four lakhs of rupees. The state will therefore inshallah b^ able to meet successfully this period of financial stringency till the dfcte season begins and trade revives. In consequence of these advers causes merchant This condition of affairs must affect theThe nltuatlon inuflt however be viewed periouely, and during the next few roonthe it will be necessary for thope in cnar^e of tae state to exercise every possible economy. As Your Highness kno^s the payment of R*.XC,000/~ a month for your personal expenses is conditional upon the state income being able to meet this charge having regard to the essential expenses of administration. Thif ie made quite clear in the letter of the P.A. to your HigiUirtoa luted the 1.7th January 1019. In your letter of the 26th January to tne P.A. in reply to tills letter Your Highness states that this sum of Rs.to» oqo/- p.m. will include presents made to Hheixhs. During Y.If'a absence in India nuch presents are male from the state treasury• In view of these clrcuiar.tances, namely the serious condition of the state finances, and Y.II’s residence in India, my government are of opinion that the amount paid form the state treasury for Y.II’s personal expenses will have to be reduced to five thousand rupees a month during the present period of financial stringency and as long ae Y.H. remains in India where Y.H.’s expenses will be far less than they are in Muscat. My government regret to have to make this decision, but they feel sure that Y.H.will understand its necessity in your own interests and in the interests of your state, They express the hope that conditions will speedily improve so as to enable a return to be made to the original payment of Rs.10,000/- p.m. Usual ending% R.E.L.Wingut# Esq* I*C.S* Th« Hon'bl# Lt-Col.A.P # Tr«Yor C.S.I.

Dear Colonel Trevor, Your D/0 of the 11th instant regarding the revision of the Commercial Treaty. The question of the revision of the treaty now raises a large number of points, and with your permission I want to put them before you. You will probably think that I am an awful trouble and am raising a number of unnecessary haresm but if you think the si tuation worth considering from the poin£ of view expressed int this letter it will probably have sons effect upon the exact details of * 7 hat you waht done. First of all as regards a few points in the treaty if it is revised. i I am sure you are right now as to the inadvisability of raising the tariff. In the first place as long as Muscat has treaties with other countries we cannot raise it as regard ourselvei without losing the position of most favoured nation. It seems scafeceiy worth while entering liito sill the diplomatic trouble which w ould be involved, and the questions that might be asked, for the sake of possibly increasing the income of this insignificant state. In the second place such action would lose half its point if it was not accompanied by the raising of the tariff in the other states of the Gulf. In the third place I doubt if it is worth while risking the possible outcry from Oman which has pe culiar ideas on the subject of all customs. I think also it might be necessary slightly to alter some of the clauses in the draft treaty of 1904 in the light of eur experience. I refer especially to the clauses dealing with the estimation of the duty, and I would suggest the insertion of a clause that while affirming tne fact that export duty is not per mitted at the same time mentioned -che right of the Sultan to levy his zakat on produce grown in his dominions and brought to the coast towns. This might in the future save a lot of trouble. Howeyer to go back to the real point of this letter. v»e hay arrivedarriyed in Muscat as you knovv at a ratHer interesting situation* To pttt it very shortly a bankrupt rule enbodyinc really no adminis tration at all, and practically not functioning except to give some decision in a case involving a British subject, and that only under pressure, was supported at ^reat expendeby us from certain annihi lation by the Omanis. At the same time we made no attempt to im prove the actual administration, on the grounds that it was not our business. This was however indefensible ^s also why did we give it armed support, pay it and save it ? This has now been replaced by a rule that is Arab at least in personnel and conforms in a small degree to the requirements of reasonable administration, while it just pulls along financially arxl provides its ovm defence, instead of our providing it. But the real head of the administration declines to interest himself in any way artf. is an absentee as long as possible, and the driving force is the influence of the political Agent, whose advice must be asked and followed on all quest! oris of importance. It is almost unnecessary to add that this advice under the conditions of the last eighteen months has had to be given frequently. While all these events were going on the absence of the Sultan was if anything beneficial, it was possible to get a move on, and he and his father have always been regarded as the source of all evil by a large section of their subjects. How a form of constitu tional rule, if it can be so termed has been introduced, ought not the Sultan to take more interest ? In other words for the moment w e have extricated ourselves and the Sultan from what wa s admit tedly a bad show., and w hich gave every prospect of beconirY£ worse, but though v/e have reduced our theoretical interfe rence t o almost nil, we have inc reased inevitab ly our in t erferenc e i n ad ministration, and so our r espo nsibility especi a lly owing to the attitude of the Sultan. Ought we not now to ca 11 a ha lt, and m ak e him accept thi s rcspqnsibilit/ for the future ? The mo ment is, a not I imagine^ having got ri d of one J 3 /, . to enter unwit tingly upon, another $*et wliic^ may eventually be v.w The two sides of the question are that the Sultan wants us to rule his state for him because there is much more chance of his being Lbeins able to lead a comfortable life in that case, we I presume v/ant to do nothing of the sort, and in the future vail be only concerned in the interests of our own subjects and in tendering the j a&amp;ininiUM amount of advice . The position of the Sultan is (1) He has taken a loan frojTi us on condition that he reforms his administration, permits us to control his finance, esta -blishes a levy and follor/s our advice. (2) these conditions he has fulfilled. (3) He refuses to take any interest in affairs and wishes to abdicate and to make us responsible. Our position is (1) 7/e have done these things (2) 7/e dont want to go any further. Even our loan is fully secured on the subsidies. (3) We want the Sultan ts accept responsibility, which is morally and actually his. To the Sultan it seems therefore, must be brought home a re- % alisation of his position, which bluntly is as follows (a) The subsidies are personal to hiia, Were he to abdicate they would automatically cease, and he would be a penilesn man as he has no private property at all, and even if his successor were to promise him an allowance we would in n® vmy he responsible for it. (b) Should in the future the state fall into disorder in its finances or otherwise, the subsidies are pledged to us for the redemption of our loan, aod they will automatical lly he stopped. It is to be presumed that his ministers will be able to pay him nothing under such circumstances. (c) Though his state is now self-supporting ani has a defense force, it still only exists through our moral support. Should that be withdrawn it will crumble to dust at once. And we will withdraw it should the Sultan persist in his attitude , or should he not act in accordance with our wishes in important matters and not continue the reform of his administration. (d) We have more than fulfilled:, and at great cost our duty towardsl try towards him. It is up to him now. He auot be the responsible ruler of his state. If anythin* goes wrong now we accept no responsibility. It is his alone. (e) Ve have made peace for hi.m with the tribes. The main tenance of this peace depends on the tribes knowing t that we support him and the agreement which was made through us. All I would ask is that the Sultan should be made to xxots understand these important points thoroughly. He is no fool, but he seems to think that the British Empire is only too delighted to take on fresh responsibilities and to administer places, quite regardless if it pays ue or not, or if itis for our benefit. I would not ask the Sultan even to reside a fixed period of the year in Lius cat. I would leave it to him but I would insist that he is personally responsible for all important measures such as tbe appointment of ministers and high ofticiais^i j. or knowing tne xinanciai condition , i ©r iixing salaries, ior looxing alter his family, for being ac quainted with political events,etc., and I would see that everybody knew this and that he made it clear in a public declaration at Muscat. At present he never even answers the queries of his ministers on any subject. Once we have cleared up the position and attitude of the Sultan, we are then in a position to revise treaties or do anything else we like. But it seems at present that there is the danger of an artificial situation developing. The moment is a critical one. One phase is over and another beginning. The seconf phase may develop into what the world regards as a British protectorate unless we make the situation clear, though actually at the moment it is much less like it than it was before. And this development will take place so to speak against our own will and simply as the result of cir- cimstances unless we seize the present opportunity, which is unique, for settling the natter once for all. !

I have the honour to forward in ori^sinal an Arabic letter which I have received from H.H. the Sultan of Muscat, the purport of which is that he cannot accept the reduction in the amount paid from the state treasury for hie personal expenditure, apparently owin^ to the fact that he has surrendered the income of Gwalur to the state treasury# It will be remembered that previously he had treated Gwadur as a private estate* The Sultan had himself of his own initiative directed that Gwadur should be included in the central custom control, openly with the idea that the inclusion of this lucrative port would make more certain the regular payment to him of his RS.10,000/- a month. When the Sultan mentioned the matter to me I naturally encouraged him to hand Gwadur,CTH l , especially as there had been many complaints as to tne customs management th re under Muhammad Resmoo. At tue same time I gave no assurance to His Highness that this would ensure the invariable payment to him of his full allowance At the present time the financial stability «rthat the Sultan’s allowance has temporarily been reduced. Owing to certain unforseen world conditiona the future is not yet clear. Shoult the state finances at this early stage become embarrassed, the Sultan must realise that he stands a very good chance of finding himself pennilesa. This temporary reduction is entirely in his own interest. It seem obvioue that he does/not understand thie. This question is closely bound up in the general question of the Sultan’s attitude to which I have referred to elsewhere. I should be grateful for your instructions as to what answer to send to the S Itan. At present I have only sent a formal acknowledge;lent of the letter, a copy of which I enclose. You may consider an answer assuring him that the • reduction is only tempoary and that Government hope shortly to discuss the whole question with him sufficient for the moment.

H.B.i-'s Consul, Muscat. Bombay• 29th August 1921 Dated 24th HaJ 1339. After compliments. We received you letter dated the 19th August 1921 from Gulmarg Kashmir at Bombay where we are still staying, and which we will not be leaving in the near future. Your friend understood your short reply which you received from the Political Resident at Bushire The answer which we gave in our letter dated the 8th July 1921 was not sufficient, so we add further have you now considered trie reform of our state finances Does the finance reform itself or can it be reformed and arranged by the people to whom it has been entrusted ?,( note, this sentence and the preeeding one are quite meaningless in the Arabic ). Do you remember the conversation which took place between us at Ambala when you asked us to go there for a personal interview. I think you may not have forgotten it, and I do not think hhat there is any laxity in the state revenue which would cause our personal allowance to be reduced. We ask your honour to submit to the Hon'ble the Political Resident and the respected Indian Government that we do not accept the reduced allowance which has been sent to us by our state with the advice of the British Agent at Muscat whether it is temporary or permanent. Also we are sure that you have not forgotten the words which I expressed before H.E. the Viceroy and the Foreign Secretary to the Indian Government in the year 1930, which you interpreted for them when we saw them on our visit to India at Delhi which was specially for this purpose. Undoubtedly the Government might have considered tills, and we are surec that our personal allowance is not sufficient, and it is unacceptable. Your Honour’s Govemnent will never like to do us any harm, and we are sure that after consideration Government will not a^ree to this matter which has been rendered to us by the British Consul with the consent of our ministers. We are a .aitin&amp; a useful answer to this our letter soon, so tuat no misunderstand- -ing may remain.

Political Reslient In the Persian Gulf Bushire British Agency and Consulate. Muscat, thetoV Sept#1921 # 191 I have the honour to forwarl an Arabic copy together with an English translation, of a letter dated 39th August from H.H. the Sultan of Muscat to my address In reply to my letter of the 19th August, a copy of which was sent to you. The letter. Judging by the atrociousness of the Arabic, seems to have been drafted by the Sultan himself in a fit of temper. It Is not in my opinion, necessary to take notice of the assertions made in it or of the manner in which they have been expressed. In view of the fact that due to the improvement in the state finances, the payment of Rs.10,000 - p.m. has been continued to him under the instructions contained in your telegram No,1503 of the third Instant, nox answer is necessary atall. The letter does however, but emphasise the point to which I have repeatedly called attention, that n0tW RMa4?K^§ 1 ^M. t &amp; 1 Ffe&amp;t^ ]2 ?? V ^ rnment lteelf t0 t&gt; iSultan will ever brings home to him his position ani hie responsibilities. It is by no means certain that the state in the future will be able to stand the strain of paying out three ani a half lakhs a year , nearly a thirl of the revenues of the state, to the Sultan and his useless fcdci family, none of whom do a handstum of work. This is a subject which the next Political Agent t will have to tackle. It is only by the most unremitting personal effort that the state finances have survived this year successfully. Trouble will arise sooner or later unless the problem of the Sultan is taken in hand at the first convenient opportunity and a definite policy decided upon. As I shall be leaving Muscat on transfer in a few days time I wish to place on record that I have called the attention of G-ovemment to this subject. I have to aid that I have gathered from conversation with K.B.Ahmad Shubaili, the Sultan's confidential secretary at Bombay, who has recently arrived in rluscat to take the Sultan's mother ani other ladies to him at Bombay, that the Sultan is sending his Turkish wife to Constantinople in February on a visit to nor parents, and probably will not return to Muscat till fcfcanx after that. i nave one nonour zo oe Sir, your most obedient servant ' jl \ ^ I.C.S.

Subject:- Necessity for explaining formally to His High ness the Sultan of Muscat what his nosition and res ponsibilities are. Sir, in April last the general s€ump in trade, scarcity and restriction of export of foodstuffs from India and other causes so diminished the income of the Muscat Customs Department, which produces by far the greater part of the State revenue, that it becctie urgently necessary to retrench. The political Agent suggested among other retrenchments that the Sultan's allowance should be temporarily reduced to R? 5,000/- per mensem. In view of the fact that in Foreign and political Depart ment memorandum No. 1496 dated the 6th October 1920 paragraph 2 (l) the Government of India had proposed to fix the Sultan's allowance at R* 5,000/- when out of Muscat, and in their memorandum No. 1766 dated 1st December 1920 the grant of the K® 10,000/- allow mce was made conditional on the capability of the State Finances to meet his charge no reference to Government appeared necessary, so I assented to Mr. Wingate's proposal and authorized the reduction of the Sultan's allowance from 1st Juno 1920. Early in September a great improvement in the Financial position at ? 'uscat took place owing to a good date season and improving-2- A , i ®. trade and at the suggestion of the Political Agent I agreed to the resumption of the 10,000/- rupees allowance to the Sultan with, effect from the Ist Sept on- her and His Highness was informed of this by Ur. Wingate, The increased allowance was remitted to the Sultan at Bombay on the 4th September 1921. Before the receipt of this, however, on 29th August 1921 His Highness had written to the Political Agent, Muscat protesting in somewhat intemperate (and ungrammatical) terms against the reduction of his allowance. I have the honour to forward herewith for the information of the Government of India a cony of Pr. ■ ' j 4 No.1401 dated 22nd September 1921.J Wingate's letter forwarding a copy and English translation of the Sultan’s letter. It is evident from it that His Highness does not understand his position at all. ! r r # Wingate has on iOrc than one occasion pointed this out and suggested that the only way to make His Highness understand it is for the Government of India to summon him to Head quarters and for the Foreign Secretary (or even better His Excellency the Viceroy) to speak to him seriously about his position and responsibilities. Up to now I nave not acted on the Political Agent’s suggestions as I hoped the Sultan would gradually understand his po sition, but I have cone to the oonclusion that he is not likely to do so. I therefore bog to support the suggestion of the Political Agent^to suggest that, if the Government of India see fit the Sultan may be summoned to Delhi at convenient time and his position explained to him by you. His mghness’s present idea is that he has divested himself of all responsibility for the administration of the State, and thrown it on to us, and that he can live at his ease in India on a comfortable allowance and in pursuance of this idea His Highness never oven answersth© queries of his Ministers. I would suggest that it ho made clear to His Highness that he cannot divost him self of the responsibilities of his position and that Government consider him personally responsible for such things as the appointment of ministers and high officials for knowing the financial condition of his State, for fixing salaries, for looking after his family nd relatives, for being acquainted with political conditions i etc, and that he makes the fact clear in a public dec laration at T 'uscat« If something of this sort is not done, I think that public opinion will gradually fix an idea that the Political Agent and the British Government are responsible for the administration of the ruscat State and that we are trying to assume a protectorate over it. This, I imagine, is the last thing we desire. I have the honour to bo.

Pooncli 24t.li November 1921 Lly deu,r Rae, Your letter o.‘ the 14th November* I think that hie Sultan iaat be referrin; to a letter I wrote to him sometime about tuat date conveying the orders of tie Government of India that he was not to be allowed to buy a house at Dehra Dun.At the end of the letter I remember adding that I hoped to inform him soon as to the orders of Govern xent on the other points which he had raised withm me on the occasion of my interview with him at Ambal on bth September 1920. This letter should be on the file ' Sultan's visit to India 1920 and the events arising therefrom A copy of it as you will see from the file was sent to the Resident who forwarded it to te G of I. The int rview which I had with him at Ambala is very important and Government passed various orders on he points he raised, which were modified later as regards tne Sultan f s residence in India and as to his allowance when there. He may be referring to his allowance, but I * think iis more likely ti.at he is referring to the question of the recognition of his son Saiyid Said as IV heir by the British Government. Government nejatived thi in their memorandum on the interview, and the Sultan was to be informed accordingly. I however suggested to Col. Trevor that as tne request was conveyed verbally it would be better to inform^of the reply of the G of I verbally t~lso. He agreed ( I tx.ink that you win find this among d/o letters ). The Sultan never turned up in Muscat for me to do this and I never gt a chance of seeing him In India, so actually the orders have never yet been convey- -ed to him. / I hope that this is what he is asking about. The actual letter to which he refers should be traceabl*- from tiie despatch register with the H.C, and it may even be filed with him. By the way was the Sultan's letter from which you quote a reply to a personal letter from me to him dated the IQthOctober in which I bade him farewell ? if so will you very kindly send me a copy ( in English not in Arabic) as I should rather like to have it, especially as you say that it was addressed to me, I have rather a fad for keeping these tilings. If you ever have time or inclination do send me a line and tell me how things are getting on, and how you find the whole comic show. Have you caught any fish? How is the club ? And when are you going into the interim This snow at iDomeay wnen the Prince arrived is rather sad xx one cant feel veryoptimistic about the rest of the visit 1-li consequence.

As to your Honour’s reply to us after referring (to the higher authorities) there is no objection. Your Honour wrote in it enquiring about your friend’s return to Muscat as we Kg** promised and that your Honour likes to discuss some questions which we mentioned in our letter dated 11th Safar 1340 (14th October 1921). You may know. Oh friend, we have already sent to Your Honour a letter from Bombay before our departure from there which was in answer of your letter regarding the question of the son Said and the College. We mentioned in that letter to Your Honour, when we return to Muscat and the cause of our delay. Now we repeat again in answer of Your Honour, yes we did not intend to remain in India in these months till the month of February but in the begin- ing of that month the mother of the son Tariq with the son will go to her relatives. After their departure if God wills we would leave for Muscat via Karachi and remain at Muscat for two months. Your friend left Bombay on the 15th November and is staying now at Bangalore and will remain upto the begining of January and then return to Bombay to send off the aforesaid, may it be known to you. We ask your Honour again in this letter that we like to settle the question of the son Said and his going to the College soon. We ordered to send a telegram to Your Honour from Bombay asking you the result about this question and expect that an useful answer might have been sent to us*Uo. ^3' b of 19*21.

The presence of a British Officer with the Levi*-rf seems very desirable in order to maintain their efficiency, and as long as Captain McCarthy is so employed he could perhaps advise to some extent on financial matters as well, being I understand a Chartered Accountant. As regards a British Officer as Hazir I am not certain that it is necessary for the state to go to such expense and I think the Political Agent can do a good deal to advise in affairs with which the Wazir would deal. Furthe it is difficult to get the right man as Wazir and the last experiment was not an unqualified success. *VERY CONFIDENTIAL• 'm No. Lfl2-S Of 1922.

The correspondence ending with your endorsement No.331.3. dated 6th December 1920 shows that he was discouraged but not actually prohibited from doing so. I gather the chief objection to the purchase of the house was that the Sultan wanted to buy it from state funds. He has now confided to me t&gt;iat he has bought the house in the name of Khan Bahadur Ahmed Shubaily paying for it from his privy purse. To avoid possible trouble about it after his death he wishes to hold it in his own name and asks if he can be permit-ued to do so.

I., Sultan of Muscat personally. 2. You will recall that so~e 3 t*&gt; 4 years ago His iligh- -ness --ar^ied a Circassian lady fro^ Constantinople by v/hori he 2i has now one son aged about years. At the ti-e of this carriage His Highness had an idea of abdicating and settling down in India and for this purpose he purchased in Dehra Bun a g-iall estate called “The Shamrock'. The transaction was carried out in the na-e of His Higliness* Secretary, one Khan Bahadur Ahn«d Shubaily.as His Highness was advised tliat as a Ruling Chief he was not allowed to hold i^^oveable property in British India. 3 . Lately the -atter has exercised His Highness consi- -derably as he wishes to earmark the property for the son re r -ferred tn above and for this reason it is necessary to trans- -fer the property to his own na^e. 4. I have searched in ^y office for any record regard- -ing the purchase of this property but I can find none and con- -clude that the transaction was put through without the offi cial knowledge,any way,of the then Political Agent. The only \mam reference I can find regarding the holding of property^' in Bri- -tish India by Ruling Chiefs is in the Manual of Instructions to Officers of the Political Department of the Government of India Chapter VI paragraph 52 which merely discourages such holding but does not lay down the legality or illegality of it. i way point out here that His Highness* position is somewhat different to that of a Ruling Chief in India in that he is the ruler of a foreign State and not a jreudatory one and pre~ -suncably the paragraph intended to apply to foreign potentates. A On the other hand there -ay be regulations in force which defi- -nitely rule out any possibility the acquisition of property in India by His Highness. 5 . in the circumstances I shall be glad if a reference can be ^ade to the Government of India enquiring whether His Highness is legally entitled to }own this property in Dehra Bunix in his own name and if so whether such a holding has the appro- -val of the Government of India.

It is presumed that Mr Y/ingate intended to acquaint Your Highness with che purport of this letter but neglected to do so — possibly through his illness. The Governaent of India’s view is that as Your Highness bought the Dehra Dun pro- -perty in opposition to their wishes they are not prepared to do anything to assist Your Highness in the matter.lt is with deep regret that I communicate this to iour Highness and I fear there have arisen since no fresh arguaents to per- -suade the Government to change their i i &lt;1 mind.

No. 63-C. of the 14th May 1929, regarding the Sultan*s house in Dehra Dun, the GoYernrnent of India’s reply (D.O. No. 989/777-X. of 25th April 1923; seems to have been very decided. Why did the Sultan purchase •'Shamrock' in the name of Shubaili, when he would probably have got his wish if he had approached Government correctly. When 1 met His Highness at Muscat he appeared to be labouring under a sense of grievance against the Government of India, and stated categorically that he would return once more to Muscat and would abdicate in 1930 in favour of any person that the Government of India might select. of grievance, and in the event of the Government of India’s meeting his wishes, is the Sultan likely to answer will be a negative, but put the question as a ballon d’ essai . is his treatment in this case the main cause reconsider his decision to abdicate ? i fear your i suppose Major G.

With reference tt yeur 90-S dated 2nd June 1929 I have sent fer the file in (juestien fr©M Muscat and a* writ ing te His Highness accordingly, but I think I can safely say forthwith that the question of the h«&gt;use in Dehra Dun is not his wain cause of grievance nor the reason for his decision to abdicate. This, Purshotam Dhanji’s house and one or t^o ether matters are merely pinpricks rhiich could usefully be removed. The question of the house in Dehra Dun is, however strangely enough not disconnected with that decision in an indirect way. ^he file in ^hich the correspondence about it is contained in my office is labelled 'Sultan’s visit to India 1920 and questions arising therefrom'. It is this file which contains His Highness’s original decision to abdicate and the questionshaving arisen at the same time are somehow associated together in His Highness's brain. I think the clue to his attitude will be found in a study of the situation in Oman in 1920. The year which saw the close of the Oman rebellion. The leaders behind this and previous rebellions for the last three quarters *f a century have been Saleh bin All and his son Isa bin Saleh, and the trouble may be traced to thG- persistence and tenacity of family characteristics and blood feuds amongst the tribal Omanis.

There is every probability that Saleh wauid have shared the same fate— if Turki had been able to seize him. This -as the beginning of the blood feud. Tur*i found himself without any infuential leader**His chief protege was a ne*ro slave,Sulaiman bin Suwaylim^whom he made Wall of Sohur # Sur and ^hofar and whose harsh rule was responsible xor a rebellion in Dhofar, the present situation # * in Sur and alienation of the Dhahirah tribes from Sohar..

The emissaries were congratulated by Sayid Nadir openly at Semail and rewarded suitably by Sir Saiyid Faisal. This was one further sta*e in the blood feud. Prior to this, Sayid Taimur had had ideas of patching up the. U blood feud but^seems to me that such ideas were dispelled by the rebellion of 1914-19. This rebellion was undoubtedly caused b v - tiie wucu j. n^.1 1 ns ©f Isa bin Salehj the tribes being; brought together in opposition to the Arms Warehouses which ^e had forced on the Sultan and ^hich they looked uj)§n us a means by which w 0 would eventually force them to submit to our rule.

By 1917, it was apparent that the rebellion had resulted in a disorganization of the Sultan’s-adwinistration whilst » the prolongation of hostilities had placed His Highness very heavily in debt. Isa seens to have made a very favourable impression on the British Officers with whom he came in contact during the negotiations for peace.Tjre his complaints ab®ut maladministra tion genuine ©r was he describing the form of administration considered necessary by a Westerner in order to please his listeners and thereby create a good effect? Saiyid Taimur, in despair, gave the Political A t ent Carte * ^ Blanche and ith the signing of peace with the intelH4%, all his hopes shattered, he proceeded to India and declared his ^ish .to abdicate. V/ithout the means to keep his position in an Arab country, with only a nominal authority and living in constant fear of assasination by Isa’s jemisearies, his attitude is under standable. His fear of assasin&amp;tion is certainly deep rooted and is of the reasons for his desire to keep away from Muscat. He pointed out to re last cold weather the device he had contrived4. contrived tt trip up anytne Trht tried t» rush through the do*r ef his private sitting r«®it suddenly.

I have personally a very high opinion of Saiyid Taimur’s abilities and think that under fairer circumstances, he wa&gt;uld , have made an admirable ruler.

Uo. 94-S. of 2nd April forwarding fliirphy’s No. 40-C. of the .^8 th March. During my visit to Muscat the Sultan raised the subject of his abdication unc ; . remained adamant in his resolve in spite of all my efforts to persuade him to alter his views. Tie says he will return to Muscat once more and after tint he will abdicate in favour of any body the British Government may select. I said that His Majesty’! Government might consider his son ^aid who is still a bov to be too young to succeed, and suggested that the Sultan might retain the rule until Said reached the age of thirty. Sultan 'aimur was however unyielding and re- . seated that if His Majesty’s Government considered Said unsuitable they coaid select some body else. It is obvious, however, that the Sultan expects Said to succeed him. This is shown by the recent appointment of the boy as Dfesident of the Council of Ministers in succession to the late Gaiyid Mfrhaned bin Aimed. This question of the succession will have to be taken up and T think that in spitfc of the fact that the rule is by right of election we shall have to accept Said as Ruler -- boy though he is. In this case we will probably have to retain 'homas Sir Denys Bray, K.C.I.3C., C.S. I. C.B.M. , Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla.Thomas as his adviser, after the latter’s term of appointment empires next year. 'he Sultan pleads ill-health as the reason for his retirement, hut T do not think this is the only or even the chief reason. I discussed the matter v/ith Murphy and it appears that the Hultan is disgruntled* He knows he is absolutely unable to manage the State without British support, but he feels that it is the British policy that has landed him in this predicament. Tt tfas the British Government who refused to allow him to take advan&amp;age of the opportunity for recovering inland Oman which he thinks offered after the repulse by Indian troops of Isa bin Saleh’s attack on Muttata in 1915. Sultan Taimur regards as unfriendly towards himself the two Political Agents who brought about the armistice with Isa bin Saleh in 1920, i.e. Haworth and Wingate. In his heart he cannot forgive them for humbl ing Xks. him before Isa bin Galen with whom and his family lie lias a long-standing blood feud. He still fears assassination at their hands. Haworth cane back as Political Resident and was in his opinion responsible for still further humbling him in the Sur affair of last year. I am showing you the situation as it strikes Sultan Taimur personally. He thinks the British Government care nothing for him and his dignity (this in spite of his official welcome to England last year). A little matter particularly irritates him. It is the pinpricks of life which so often do. In 1920 His Highness purchased a house in Pehra He inforras Murphy that he first broached the subje ct Pun.subject of the purchase to Captain McCollum, v;ho vraa his Mailer deputed by A. T. Wilson from Iraq. McCollum said there should be no difficulty about the purchase. He entered into negotiations for the purchase of the house by instalments and the receipt for the first instalment was made in his own name. He lat^ received a verbal message from McCollum sent through one of his own servants to the effect that the Government of India would not consent to his owning a house in Dehra Qun in his own name and that he would have to put it in some one else’s name. As he had already paid a part of the purchase money felt himself bound to complete the transaction am did so, purchasing in the r nae of his Hecretary Ghubaili. His Highness wishes his son by his Turkish wife to inherit this house; and Shubaili assures Murphy that there would be no difficulty about transferring the house to His Highness if the Government of India approved. His Highness informed me that although lie could trust Hhubaili to carry out his wishes, there is no khowing what difficulties lawyers and executors might raise in the future. His Highness does not mention the whole story. It appears from the Ttesidency files that lie bad informed Wingate that he had found a suitable house at Hehra Hun and that Wingate replied on the 15th October 1920 saying: H ?he Government of India desire me to inform Your High- 'ness that the general policy of the Government of India 'is opposed to the grant of permission to purcliase land in India by independent rulers and that, therefore, 'sanction can only be given for the lease of a house 'by Your Highness at Hehra Hun or elsewhere.' 'he re has also be eh some demi-official correspondence between m revor and Howell. The last letter on the file is Howell’s H.C. Ho. 9G9/777-X., dated the 25th April 1923, in which he declined to help. Years have elapsed and. Government may perchance liave22 ? - 4 have Modified their attitude towards nultan ''aimur. I certainly think that his abdication ne*.t year would be unfortunate, especially as the ntate Jias been deprived by death of the service!? of fJaiyid Mohammed, late Wall of Muttra, the most sensible man on the State Council» &gt; Major Murphy does not think that permission to hold his Dehra Dun house in his own name i!? the only or even the chief cause of the Sultan’s desire to ab dicate, but at the same time he considers 'if the Sultan is to be persuaded to abandon his resolve, a modification of Government’s attitude with regard to his house would be a very useful preliminary.” I think it’would be a ^ood ibove to grant the Gultan the permission he still seeks -- to hold the Dehra Dun house in his own name, -- but 1 do not know how strongly Government hold to their policy of 1920. Is it any good returning to the charge ? This small matter may possibly prove a starting point to induce the vain and*idle puppet, as Wingate called him, to a change of view, thought the road must be long and difficult. In 1920 the Sultan was smarting under a serious defeat. Murphy has a very high opinion of his abilities and thinks that under fairer circumstances he would have made an admirable ~uler. His childish play fulness seems to hi» a cloak of a deeper personality. The question of the succession may have to be tanen up shortly, but I think our best course is to attempt tc postpone it Mil we can see how young Said shapes. 'here are some slight signe of a rapproach- ment with the interior, in spifcfc of the blood feud and the Sultan ’5 fear of assassination, owing zo joint fear of Bin Hand. If^ * W - / ! - 5 - «, &gt; T '-r If youn^ Said tui'nB out well, an 1 hope he will, there is a possibility, though no probability so far as I can see, that he may at some future date resume possession of the Arabian portion of his ^reat namesake’s inheritance.
