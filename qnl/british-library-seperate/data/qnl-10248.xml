The papers mostly cover the rebellion of the Al-Sa'ad tribe and the concurrent efforts of the British to suppress their rebellion in support of the Sultan of Oman and Muscat. The file contains several letters by the head of the Al-Sa'ad, Sayyid Hamad bin Ahmed, and Sultan Turkee bin Said of Oman. Most of the papers however, are between officials of the Government of India at Calcutta and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Rebellions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00021f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00021f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00021f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
