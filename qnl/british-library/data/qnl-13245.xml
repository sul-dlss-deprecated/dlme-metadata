The author expresses his belief that a profit for the Company can be made, and backs this up with two reports by people who have travelled to that region.The first report is by Cojee Sarkees, former Custom Master for Carem Caun [Karim Khan] at Ruchd [Rasht]. It gives details of total amount of silk produced, where it is exported to, where the merchants are from, the cost of transportation to Bushire, and the types of goods that may be sold in Gilan. He also gives details of a local 'silk cotton' called Kedje.The second report is by Antonio Pilloni [?], hired by Jervis to investigate the trade at Gilan. He gives a more detailed account of the journey from Rasht to Bushire, including times and probable costs. There is a list of goods that will sell in Rasht and the prices they are sold at.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189854.0x00005b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
