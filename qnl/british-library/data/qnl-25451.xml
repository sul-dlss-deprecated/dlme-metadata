The King of Hejaz and Ibn Baud* The Chairman stated that the paper by Sir Hamilton Grant, suggested that the best thing would be for us to let these two chieftains fight it out between themselves, Mr, Shuckburgh said that the Secretary of State for India, who was absent in Paris, inclined to Sir Hamilton Grant’s views rather than to his own. The Chairman agreed that our general experience was that, if we left these rival chieftans alone, nothing in particular happened. He thought the oest thing ftiereiore was to ignore them. If, nowever they did come to blows* and the Wahabis were victorious and the Hedjaz or the Holy Places were ( threatened, he thought that we should be bound to support King Hussein with munitions, though in no circumstances with troops. We might, therefore, if a suitable occasion presented itself, intimate to King Hussein that His Majesty’s Government were too fully occupied to intervene in the quarrels between himself and Ibn Saud; that we had exerted our influence to restrain Ibn Saud: that we had offered to both our services as arbitrator between them at the end of the war; that we would not. however allow the Hejaz to be overrun, and he mignt count on us for every assistance, snort of troops, in securing his frontier. General Thwaites said that the War Office supported Sir Hamilton Grant’s policy; they were further prepared, as suggested by the Chairman, if it were necessary, to supply the King with munition^ but they were not prepared to send troops. * * * * * *Ib any. further communication on .this subject, please quote / No ' and address— not to any person by name, but to— “ The Under-Seoretary of State,” Foreign Office, ^ London, S.W. 1 , ,* ,n jC ^ O w o 1 &lt;'&gt; r/T D» l * THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to hL. -iLUi*. cfL '&amp;SUZ ry^cCcXV. and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop^e^ of the under-mentioned paper.

On the 24th March 1920, I was invited out to Jabal Bukhan (25 miles from lanaman) by Siaaikh Hamad A1 Shaikh Hamad did me very well, and among other things he sl and I arranged to have a 'Race Meeting' at Gathaibiyah (a flat space of sandy ground behind Manamah) somewhere about 15th April, 1920. Shaikh Hamad, on 25th larch had a long private talk with me, the subject of which was as follows. I repeat it, as it may be of interest. (l) Shaikh Hamad asked me if it were true that His Majesty 1 s Government was displeased with the Shareef Hussain now-a-days, and had secretly ordered Bin Saud to attack him, and that should be do so and prove victorious, whether Government would allow him to rule over the Hejaz, and be the guardian of the Holy places. He, Hamad, gave it his personal opinion that the entire Arab race would be grateful and pleased with His Majesty's Government’s action should they allow such to take place. My answer was, of course, very guarded; at the same time I let Shaikh Hamad know that up to date it had been His Majesty’s Government which had kept the peace between both parties, and there was no reason to suppose it would change its attitude in the future.

They are convinced that the danger of such a cat as- trophe will never be removed until, a meeting: has been arranged between the two. They realise that ibxa k^aud is reluct,ano to meet King Hussein either in the Hejaz or in the Hejaz territorial waters, and do not wish to press him to accept this alternative. At the same time they regard his proposal that King Husoein Siioold meet him at Baghdad’or Bombay ej 3 impracticable, and they do not propose to make this suggestion to King Hussein. Both rulers are hereby invited by His Majesty^ Government to agree to a meetii&gt; at Aden or on board of one of His Majesty's Ships in Aden Harbour. His Majesty’s Government are ready to arrange for this meeting to take place either immediately, or, if climatic conditions and the approachapproach of tne pilgrimage season render this irnpra-clicable, a.s soon as possible after the pilgriuoge is over, Tiiey are also ready to place at the disposal oi each of the two rulers any British officer whom either may select/ to assist him and 5 if necessary 0 to represent his own point of view to His Majesty’s Government/* In addition to.this they are prepared to select an impartial official of high standing to arbitrate on such points as may be referred to him by eionei of tno uwo rulers. In the meanwhile they desire to uigo upon do tli parties the paramount importance of maintaining the existing truce between them over the pilgrimage season. They accordingly invite them to co-operate with each other to this end and to give imtual assurance to His Majesty’s Government that the re-opening of the pilgrimage to the people of Kejd shall not be attended with any disturbance. King Hussein is hereoy requested by His Majesty 1 s Government to guarantee that the pilgrimage will be re-opened on the understanding that Ibn Saud guarantees that the pilgrims from Nejd will be placed in charge of..a responsible official who will unde it aloe to ensure their good behaviour, Ibn Saud is requested to furnish this guarantee on the understanding that King Hussein puts no difficulties in the way of the pilgrimage, and undertakes on his side to restrain his people from any aggression against the Nejd pilgrims* Both rulers are invited to maintain the existing status quo until each has returned to his own dominions after the proposed meeting. They are also invited to signify their concurrence in a meeting at Aden under the'3' In tu.3 conditions outlined in this message, the event of either (1) Declining to accept a meeting at Aden (2) Declining to preserve the existing status quo until after the meeting (3) Declining to give the required guarantees of t&gt;vOCi. hsu^viour on the part of their followers during the pilgrimage 5 that ruler cannot reasonably expect a continuance oi financial or other support from His Majesty’s Government.

Mny 6th, 192C. Ky dear Shuck burgh, T 'y interview with you this afternoon h.R.e made me verv much happier than I have been for a long time, not only about myself but about the future of Arabia generally* The consequences of a further open rupture between Ibn Saud and the King (to say nothing of the possible capture of Keccs, etc. by the former) would have been disastrous both for them and for us, and I am very glad that F.M.G. are making resolute efforts to avert such a. catastrophe, I have always thought that the non-intervention policy would lead to serious trouble and I have anxiously watched the days slipping by towards the festival of next August, which I regard as the probable date for the beginning of the end. However there is still hope that the castastrophe may be averted and I am particularly glad that HJI.Gh have allowed Ibn Saud*s subsidy to run on as before, pending further development of the situation. I am also glad that the project for the meeting if the two monarchs has not been abandoned in spite of the unfavourable omens on both sides. Kith regard to the threat to stop the subsidy of the party which does not accept the present proposal, I should like parenthetically to make a point which I did not make this afternoon. Supposing Ibn Sa.ud to be obstinate enough to decline the invitation of H.E.G. on the ground that the locality selected for the proposed meeting is unacceptable to him he would forfeit his subsidy but the capture of Mecca would be a check mate to our policy and he would lose comp a ra t i v e 1 v 1 i itl e. X v However that may be you are asking him to accept a proposal3 tAA 7 t^w S, U^/Cu. j &amp;+■* J- !*• *»*W- Ik. A* (^s. I. vLrru. U** (Ai,) t*- (h-w ^ /jUb*#*«A V-»W &amp;H&gt;f* ^ ^ ^ La- «*^ tv&gt; 4^ &lt;V» kN9 A&lt;&gt; @) proposal which he hss already turned down without stating hia reason, it is true, but apparently for the sane reasons for which he declined to go to Cairo. You have offered him the additional sop of a. political officer of his own choosing •mf that may prove effective (if so it would have been equally effective in the case of Cairo which I imagine the T -'.C. would prefer and which would have been a better meeting p!-ce than a battleship in Aden harbour) but the mere I think about it. the less confident I feel that he will agree. On this subject I speak with strong personal feelings as I fully realise that the prospect of my further employment in connection with Arabian politics depends on his acceptance of ^aeinvitation; no one is therefore more concerned to ^ r e accept it than I, an^ I feel extremely confident that I o\ €m cou,e 'is scruples by a litule arentle persuasion. You have assumed me both that KJUQ # are extremely anxious for the ueetin/y to take place and that they are prepared not only to receive but to accede to a demand on I bn Sand’s part that I should be attached to him? They could I think have ensured tee meeting taking place by sending me as the bearer of the.ir message - some time ago you may remember I volunteered to do this - but by sending a written message as they have done they are risking the chance of a refusal by Ibr Sard a a c^iuical moment, at a moment Then the preparations tor a kajd pilgrimage are too far advanced to be cancelled and thus of a pilgrimage liable to serious disturbance and without guarantee s. c. .o. seer to feel little concern as to whether the proposed meeting is to take place before or after the pilgrimage* ’y own opinion, if I may state it, in face of w-ic t of II .1 .G-. , 3 s teat it is essential that the meeting should take place before the pilgrimage for this reason: if the meeting results in no satisfactory agreement we are left waere we were before with the advantage however that Ibn Saud Hwould be away from Ms own country and therefore not in a position to direct any hostile movement, while he could scarcely lea/ve Najd for the purpose of meeting Husain without giving explicit orders to his intending pilgrims to avoid all friction during their stay in Mecca - this pilgrimage would therefore pass off without incident; if on the other hand % the meeting did result in a compromise satisfactory to both parties with Ibn Saud himself within easy reach of Mecca what more splendid consummation of the agreement could be imagined than a visit of Ibn Saud himself to Mecca as to the guest of the King? The message is presumably irrevocably on its way now and in any case I am not keen on another lightning journey to the East, but my suggestion is that no time should be lost in bringing them together and that, if I am to go out, I should go with the least possible delay eituer to Ibn Baud Ox to Bahrain to await his answer, which can scarcely arrive there much before the end of June, with instructions to visit him at once if his answer is unfavourable. Apologies for the length of this. Yours sincerely, (SB.) IK ST. J. PHILBY.£ //, J V Private, Your private telegram of 18th instant. Bin Baud, King Hussein has never been popular with Indian Moslems and last year’s Haj probably added to his unpopular!ty. The majority of Indian Moslems would not view his activity with any regret but a Wahabi invasion of the Hedjez and seizure of the holy places possibly accompanied by a repetition of the incidents of 1802 and 1803 would undoubtedly fill Mohamedans with horror and dismay and the British Government would have to bear the major part of the odium, the allegation being made that this was the first-fruits of the Turkish peace treaty and of a deposition of the Khalif^r from Guardianship of the holy places. To ?(avoid) such a catastrophe I think any reasonable measure of support of Hussein against Bin Saul would be justified and would probably not be so severely criticised by Indian Moslem opinion if it were made clear that the object was to protect the holy pieces from Wahabi aggression rather than to uphold Hussein, see my official telegram 879 - S of June 15th 1919 Foreign and Political Department.I ill Document- is the Propevo; Government, and should Office if not required y o i be re for :US ■O.C -urned ' .A M W C'-t i pv X. -V, to jeoty official mic the Foreign e„) : i P FI LES ONLY .

We are under very definite obligations to King Hussein whom we have set up in face of some opposition on the parr of India and other Moslems and it is our duty and to our advantage (? to) support him. Nothing he has done justifies a reversal of our considered attitude. To countenance any aggression on the part of Bin Saud would be to admit failure of policy which has guided us during the last four years. Conquest of Hedjas would be a very definite blow to our dip lomacy and would in my opinion weaken our position in Moslem world. I consider it would be most dapgerou to give any encouragement to a movement which would completely destroy balance of power in Arabia and leave it in the hands of a sect which appears to be restrained chiefly by personality of one man.I do not venture to predict effect on Indian ^ Moslems though opinion of Indians here with whom I have talked indicate that (? it would he) serious a I feel strongly that all our efforts should he directed to maintain King Hussein on his throne and that (? if) Bin Baud shows ary tendency towards aggression every possible means should he taken to prevent him* Addressed to Foreign Office No«395o Repeated to Bagdad*I (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE at* ?

The only way of bringing about peace is to reconcile chiefs and until that is done at e, meeting between them troubles may occur at any time* I agree that Bin Baud might be offended if King were invited alone and think that both should be invited or neither, although King will doubtless be disappointed if not invited, I do not see that visit of King need necessarily affect larger Arab question. It might on the other hand be useful to have him at home when terms of Turkish Peace Treaty to which he will probably greatly object are published* Abdullah* &gt; Abdullah would remain at Mecca in the absence of the PCing and I do not think that there is any necessity to invite him to England,, Addressed to Foreign Office numbered 383, repeated to Bagdad*/ To iuie Secretary of State for India, ^ated 15th.

Bin Saud applies for a British Indian Mahometan ' , doctor vide my separate telegram. 2. Fresh tribes continue to accept the leadership of Bin Saud, the latest recruits are Ajman who have started ruling the south towards Hassa. Akhwan movement is viewed with increasing complaisance in Bahrein itself and Bin Saud has received letters from Chiefs of Trucial Coast making overtures to him. Bin Saud has not replied to these letters. 3. King Hussein is apparently unsuccessfully endeavour ing to utilize Sheikh Isa of Bahrein as counterblast to Bin Saud, There has certainly been much correspondence between two recently. (-*^friction between Bahrein and Nejd is now acute in regard to Custom-House matters and question^ of protection of Nejd subjects in Bahrein which Bin Saud requests us to exercise on his behalf contrary to wishes of Sheikh of Bahrein. 4. Probability of Bin Saud seizing Mecca is being discussed with ( in Bahrein and elsewhere in Persian Gulf and in Mesopotamia.

The rapid spread of Akhwan movement is a danger unless King and Bin Baud are reconciled without delay.

High Commr.. Cairo, and a summary of recent correspondence on the subject. Lord Curzon concurs in Mr. Secretary’s Mori tagu’s opinion that immediate steps should be taken with a view to the reopening of the Nejd pilgrimage, but he is strongly of opinion that the scheme for a meeting between the two ruler? should not be abandoned. His Lordship contem plates the possibility of a Wahabi invasion of Mecca with the greatest misgiving and trusts that Lord AHenby is mistaken in the inference which he draws from Col. Wilson's tel. of the 15th April. A Wahabi occupation of the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina, and the consequent growth of Wahabi power and influence, might, ii H.L's opinion, lead in the future, as it did in the past, to massacres such as those of 1801 al KerbeJa and of 1802 at Taif: to repeated raids on Iraq: to the turning back from the Holy Pla. ces of all pilgrims who were unwilling to pro fess Wahabi tenets; and possibly to costly and difficult military operations, or, failing these to a loss of prestige for H.M.G. which His Lordship/Ldridship would regard as a capital disaster. F JI.G. have supported and financed an Arab revolt gainst the Turks, headed by King Hussein, who has consequently been.jreepgni sed by the Allied Powers is an independent sover eign. They are also claiming from the Peace Conference a special position in Arabia ex clusive of the Hedjaz. His Lordship considers that these two considerations inevitably com mit H.v.G.to doing everything in their power to prevent the overrunning of the independent Hedjaz by one of the rulers for whom they will in the future be solely responsible. He fully realizes the reluctance of Ibn Saud to meet King Hussein at Jeddah, but he is not convinced from the information before him that the possible alternatives have been put for ward with sufficient force to Ibn Saud v His Lordship still remains doubtful whether the afcternative of a meeting on board one of H, i. ships, which was first suggested by r. Montagu in India Office telegram of the 23rd February to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, has even been proposed to Ibn Saud. 'Aor is he convinced that the letter, if suitably- urged to do so, vould decline to meet King Hussein either onmboaisd of one of H. .ships at Aden, or even at Aden itself.

We are under very definite obligations to King Hussein whom we have set up in face of some opposition on the part of India and oTdier Moslems and it is our duty and to our advantage (? to) support him. Nothing he has done justifies a reversed, of our considered attitude. To countenance any aggression on the part of Bin Gaud would be to admit failure of policy which has guided us during the last four years. Conquest of Hedjas would be a very definite blow to our dip lomacy and would in my opinion weaken our position in Moslem world.

His Lordship contemplates the possibility of a Wahabi invasion of Mecca with the greatest misgiving and trusts that Lord Allenby is mistaken in the inference which he draws from Colonel Wilson’s telegram of the 15th.April. A Wahabi occupation of the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina, and the consequent growth of Wahabi power and influence, might, in His Lordship’s opinion, lead in the future, as it did in the past, to massacres such as those of 1801 at Kerbela and of 1802 at Taif: to repeated/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office.repeated raids on Iraq; to tie turning tack from the Holy Places of all Pilgrims who were unwilling to profess Waliahi tenets: and possibly to costly and difficult military operations, or, failing these, to a loss of prestige for His Majesty's Government which His Lordship would regard as a capital disaster. His Majesty's Government have supported and financed an Arab revolt against the Turks, headed by King Hussein, who has consequently been recognised by the Allied Powers as an independent sovereign. They are also claiming from the Peace Conference a special position in Arabia exclusive of the Hedjaz. His Lordship considers that these two considerations inevitably commit His Majesty's Government to doing everything in their power to prevent the overrunning of the independent Hedjaz by one of the rulers for whom they will in the future be solely responsible. He fully realizes the reluctance of Ibn Saud to meet King Hussein at Jeddah, but he is not convinced from the infor mation before him that the possible alternatives have been put forward with sufficient force to Ibn Saud. His Lord- ship still remains doubtful whether the alternative of a meeting on board one of His Majesty's ships, which was first suggested by Mr. Montagu in India Office telegram of the 23rd. February to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, has even been proposed to Ibn Saud. Nor is be convinced that the latter/latter, if suitably urged to do so, would decline to meet King Hussein either on board of one of His Majesty's ships at Aden, or even at Aden itself. His Lordship observes from the correspondence forwarded with India Office letter No. P.3201 of the 29th. April that in his letter to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, Ibn Baud makes no mention of Aden as a possible meeting-place. policy of His Majesty's Government is not fully realized by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, but in view of the latter's telegram of the 15th. April, he considers that the position should now be made clear both to him and to His Majesty's High Commissioner, Cairo. draft telegram which His Lordship proposes to address to His Majesty's High Commissioner, Cairo, and to request that, if Mr. Montagu concurs, an identical telegram should be addressed by the India Office to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. In the event of Mr. Montagu desiring to make any substantial modification to the terms of the draft telegram, His Lordship suggests that the question should be discussed by the Inter departmental Conference on Middle Eastern Affairs on Monday, the 3rd. May. Lord Curzon is reluctant to believe that the I am accordingly to transmit herewith a I am, Sir.

They are convinced that the danger of such a catastrophe will never be removed until a meeting has been arranged between Hussein and Ibn Saud. They realise that the latter is reluctant to meet Hussein either in the Hejaz or in the Hejaz territorial waters, and do not wish to press him to accept tills alternative. At the same time they regard his proposal Baghdad or Bombay as impracticable, and they do not propose to make this suggestion to King Hussein. Both King Hussein and Ibn Saud are hereby invited by His Majesty's Government to agree to a meeting at Aden or on board of one of His Majesty's ships Telegram His Majesty's Government regard with that King Hussein should meet him at in/in Aden Hard our.

In the meanwhile they desire to urge upon both parties the paramount importance of main taining the existing truce between them over the pilgrimage aeason. They according ly invite them to co-operate with each other to this end and to give mutual assurances to His Majesty’s Government that the re-opening of the pilgrimage to the people of Nejd shall not be attended with any disturbance. King Hussein is hereby requested by His Majesty’s Government to guarantee that the pilgrimage will be re-opened on the understanding that Ton Baud guarantees that the pilgrims from Nejd will be placed in charge of a responsible/it 1% responsi' , ole official who will under take to ensure their good behaviour. Ton Saud is requested to furnish this guarantee on the understanding that King Hussein puts no difficulties in the way of the pilgrimage, and undertakes on his side to restrain his people from any aggression against the Nejd pilgrims.

Wilson submitted a letter to the Foreio-n Omce m which he set forth Hussein’s point of view, and expressed the hope that he might be placed m a position to give him some encouragement on his return to Jeddah. Un the -4th November the question was discussed by the Conference, and it was decided that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should give written instructions ini. VlS0 \ aS t0 the line he should take with Xing Hussein on his return to eddah, and that he should receive Ibn Saud’s delegation and inform them of the suggestion which was being made to King Hussein for a conference between the two . He expressed some surprise that Tbn Sand should demand the ratification of the treaty entered into by His Majesty’s Government. There was, so far as he knew, no term set to the treaty, and in these circumstances there did not appear to be any necessity for its renewal. He said that His Majesty’s Government did not propose to discuss the disputed boundary with either party. He sincerely hoped that the meeting would re sult in an agreement being arrived at. 3. The question of an embargo on pilgrims from Nejd appeared to him to depend entirely on the relations between the two rulers. If, as he hoped, before the next pilgrimage season commenced they had found a solution to their differences, the question would not arise. 4. He did not consider that it was a suitable moment to discuss the enhancement of the Ibn Saud subsidy, at a time when he was not on friendly terms with a friend and ally of His Majesty’s Government. b. He did not quite understand the suggestion that Mr. Philby should be despatched to Ibn Saud as Political Agent, empowered for the solving of the boundary question and other kindred problems, inasmuch as the proposals now put forward by His Majesty’s Government would, he hoped, result in these problems being solved without British intervention.

Un me 15th December the Foreign Office approved this proposal. On the 17th December a copy of a telegram of the bth December irom the Civ Commissioner at Baghdad was received in the Foreign Office, ibis telegrain statod that Ibn Sand had reported on the 22nd November that Husseins two sons Ah a Abdullah, with several notables, had left Tail, accompanied by 400 infantry drafts an 200 horses. Ibn Sand believed that, the Sherif intended to move against him, and said that, if he did so, he would be resisted by foice ; r a- ()p’ ice On the 17th December the Civil Commissioner was informed by the a of the proposal that Hussein and Ibn Saud should me ® t e ^.' ts him * approach Ibn Saud officially until Hussein had expressed his readiness to meet hi ^ lP On the 24th December the Foreign Office received a telegram from Lord Alle y, in wldch the latter referred to a despatch of the 18th November from the Civ Commissioner, Baghdad. He considered that his remarks regarding he atuatiOT Syria and Palestine and the state of Feisal s troops were objectionable. nfi , n „ Q i ^^'onthe 24th December, the India Office enquired whether any con tirmatmn had (165089) beeu received in the Foreign Office of the report mentioned in the Cavil Coming - telegram of the 6th December (see above, 162406). 1 hey also transim e( ‘ - t | ie telegram of the 13th December from the Civil Commissioner m which he ^ receipt of a letter, dated the 26th November, from Ibn Saud. 1q tluh , , |lu3se j n repudiated the charge that he had been taking taxes at ^aba an I 1 &lt; p- 1 . 8 with a deliberate attempt to create 5 'h, disturLL it„,„&gt;rnnu&gt;nt bv incorrect statements of this sort.

He solemnly undertook that it the Sherif were required by His Majesty’s Government to remove his sons from Taif, he himself would make no move. On the 1st January the Foreign Office replied to the India Office that they had had (165089) no confirmation of the intended aggression on the part of King Hussein, referred to in' tbe Civil Commissioner’s telegram of the 6th December, and that they considered it improbable that Ibn Saud’s allegations had any foundation in fact. On the 3rd January the Foreign Office received a copy of a despatch of the (167343) 18tli December from His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Cairo to the Civil Commis sioner, Baghdad, in which he informed him of his approaching visit to Jeddah, and referred to his telegram of the Kith December (see 165089 above'. . p 11 t]le January King Hussein telegraphed to His Majesty the King, expressing (169257) his pleasure at his meeting with Lord Allen by at Jeddah. ^ ri ^ le ^th January the foreign Office received a copy of a telegram of the (169273) iLth December from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, in which he reported that tbe payment of the Ibn Saud subsidy had continued at full rates and that Ibn Sand had not been^ informed of the reduction ordered by India Office telegram of the 1-th March. Ibis telegram had reached Baghdad after his departure, and had been overlooked by him on his return in May. He had assumed the India Office telegram of the Ibth July to mean that the subsidy was to be continued at the rate of 5,000k, 2 .e», half the lO,000k he had been receiving till December 1918. He recommended deferring reduction of the subsidy until the 1st April. On the 15th Januai y the India Office transmitted to the Foreign Office a copy of a ( j 70261) note by Captain Bray, who had been in charge of the i\ejd Mission during the last (lays °f As stiiy in Pans. They pointed out that this report emphasised the deter mination of the Wahabis to participate in this year’s pilgrimage, and trusted that the consequent importance of arriving at an early settlement of the matters in dispute would not be foigotten by the authorities in Egypt. They also suggested that an undertaking might be obtained from Ibn Saud to the effect that he would not tolerate forced conversions, and that it might be better for him not to be left to receive his first impression as to the result of his delegation’s visit to England from them direct. . ()u ^ le Efth January the Foreign Office received a copy of the despatch referred to m Lord Allen by’s telegram of the 20th December. (See 164924 above.) On the same day the India Office suggested that the Civil Commissioner might be authorised to inform Ibn Saud that active negotiations were m progress. Also on the same day a telegram was received from Lord Allenby in which he reported that he had had two interviews with King Hussein. The latter had regarded the question of Ibn Saud as of very little importance, and had consented to meet him at Jeddah and to endeavour to come to a friendly arrangement with him. On the I7th January the Foreign Office transmitted a copy of Lord Allenby’s telegram to the India Office, and suggested that Ibn Saud should now be informed officially- of the proposal made by His Majesty’s Government and of Hussein’s acceptance of it. Ibn Saud might also be informed of the general trend of the conversation between his representatives and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, without undue emphasis being laid on the fact that it had not been found possible to meet their - demands without question. The Foreign Office considered that Ibn Saud should be invited to visit Jeddah with the feast possible delay. On the 20th January copies of despatches from Baghdad were received in the (179142) foreign Office reporting the spread of the Akhwan movement. On the same day the I 1 oreign Office received a copy of the correspondence (171966) between the Government of India, the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, and the Political Agent at Bahiein on the subject of the reports to the effect that Ibn Saud had been receiving from Karachi large sums of silver in connection with the Wahabi movement. Ihe Civil Oommissioner had no reason to think that Ibn Saud had been receiving anv silver other than the V0,000 rupees which had been hitherto sent to him monthly in silver from Karachi. He stated on the 9th November, 1919, that the subsidy would be paid in notes in future. On the 23rd January the Foreign Office invited the attention of the India Office (170336) to Lord Allenby s telegram of the 20th December, and stated that they concurred (170336) (170337) (170459)(173984) (173436) (174275) (173436) (175319) (175916) (176927) (176615) in his view of the passages in Colonel Wilson’s letter to Ibn Sand to which the High Commissioner had taken exception. They suggested that Colonel Wilson should be given the opportunity of furnishing some explanation on the subject. On the 24th January the India Office instructed the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to communicate a message to Ibn Sand, informing him that Hussein was willm^o meet him at Jeddah and urging him to seize this opportunity of effecting a fnenv.,y settlement, and to make arrangements to proceed to Jeddah at the earliest possible On the 26th January the Foreign Office received a copy of a telegram, dated the the 18th January, from (he Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, m which he reported the continuous progress of the Akhwan movement The Political Agent, Bahrein, was inclined to the view that the movement was bound before long to give Ibn baud a popular hold in Arabia, greater than anything to which the Shenfian family could hope (to &lt;nj&gt; January t p e Office informed the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, that their attention had been called by the Foreign Office to a telegram from the High Commissioner at Cairo, questioning the expediency of the passage m his letter to Ibn Saud on the 17th November, which related to the situation in Syria and the state of Feisal’s troops, and asked him to telegraph his observations. . . ■ On the 31st January the Foreign Office transmitted to the High Commissioner at Cairo a copy of the note by Captain Bray, which they had received from the India Office, and called his attention to the denial by the Nejd Mission that the Akhwan movement countenanced forcible conversions. 1 hey asked whether Bold AMenhy considered it desirable to inform King Hussein of this statement. 1 he\ also asked tie opinion of the India Office on this point. . n n , . T On the 2nd Februarv the Foreign Office received copies of two telegrams ot the 23rd and the 24th January from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. In the first ot these he reported that Ibn Saud had written to him on the 6th January repeating Ins conviction that Hussein was not to be trusted, and reiterating his earnest desire for peace. In the second, he stated that the Political Agent at Bahrein had received an urgent letter from Ibn Saud, dated the 15th January, in which he said that he had decided to set out at once for Hasa, as he had a most important communication o make concerning His Majesty’s Government and himself of a nature which should not be delayed or ignored. He asked that the Civil Commissioner should meet turn m person The Civil Commissioner had authorised the Political Agent, Bahrein, o proceed to Hasa to meet Ibn Sand, and said that he would, if necessary, arrange tor the Deputy Political Resident, Bushire, to proceed to Hasa m February. It was impossible'for him to go there himself in view of the existing situation in the direction of Deir-az-zor. This telegram crossed that sent by the India Office on the ^tli January (see 173984 above). , On the 4th February the Foreign Office received a copy of a telegram of the 28th January from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, m which he stated that the Nejd Mission, which was then in Bombay, would reach Hasa about the 20th 1 ebruary. m proposed to defer the delivery of the message, communicated to him m the India Office telegram of the 24th January, until Ibn Saud had conferred with the Mission, and until he had further information himself as to the nature of the communication referred to by Ibn Saud in his letter of the loth January. He did not think that xbn Sand would consent to proceed to Jeddah by land, and thought that theie were w0 possible alternatives : either that Hussein should be asked to agree to a mee iDg in the neighbourhood of Taif, Ashairah or Turaba, or that Ibn Saud shou c e as ~e visit Hussein at Jeddah by sea. . • n ta • On the 5th February the India Office, in consultation with the loreign umce replied approving Colonel Wilson’s proposal. They pointed out that His ± ajes } Government attached great importance to the meeting between Hussein an n a &gt; and that the latter’s visit to Hasa afforded an opportunity that was not live y 0 ie ’ not only of influencing him effectively in the desired direction, but also o t mu that he actually set out on the journey. On the same day they re 4 ues ^j c . Admiralty to instruct the Naval Commander-in-chief, East Indies Station, to/ende ^ Civil Commissioner such assistance as might be in his power for arranging transport of Ibn Saud by sea, from Hasa to Jeddah ^ On the 6th February the Foreign Office received Lord Allenbys repoit on ^ visit to Jeddah. King Hussein had been very much excited about the Symn que and had regarded the Ibn Saud matter as of minor importance. He had agiee meet Ibn Saud at Jeddah.5 4 +J ^ t ^ ie February the Foreigu Office received a copy of a telegram of the (176825) l^t February from the Civil Commipsioner, Baghdad, in which he explained that for the past five years the relations of His Majesty’s Government with Ibn Sand had been marked by the frequent exchange of personal letters between the latter and the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. News of the state of affairs in Syria reached Ibn Saud very xapidly, and in a form that would generally be wholly unfavourable both to His Majesty s Government, to the French and to the Shenf Feisal. He explained the passages in his letter to which the High Commissioner at Cairo had taken exception, by saying that it appeared to him preferable that Ibn Saud should receive from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, early, even if not authoritative, news of current events, and that it was entirely to our interests and to those of the peace of Arabia that he should not feel that the representatives of His Majesty’s Government, with whom he was m diplomatic relations, had been withholding news from him (see 170356 above). . t ^ e 1th February the India Office expressed the opinion that Hussein should (H. 9) be informed of the statement made by the Nejd delegation to Captain Bray denvin^ forcible conversion by the Akhwan movement (see 173436). On the 14th February the Foreign Office enquired whether the India Office (176825) considered the explanation offered by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, of the expressions used in his letter to Ibn Saud satisfactory. On the 16th February the India Office informed the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, (E. 6U) that the Admiralty had instructed the Naval Commander-in-chief, as requested by him, but that they considered it unlikely that he could spare a ship, and suggested that a Royal Indian Marine vessel might be lent by the Government of India if Ibn Saud could not travel by ordinary steamer. On the 18th February the loreign Office received copies of three telegrams of the (E 235) l^th February from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. In the first of these he reported instiuctions given by him to the Political Agent, Bahrein, in regard to his with Ibn baud. In the second he reported the nature of a communication which Ibn Saud had made to the Political Agent. This was to the effect that Hussein had decided to utilise an alleged movement in Syria towards Jihad, in order to reinstate himself m the eyes of the Moslem world, and at the same time to discredit Ibn Saud. He said that Hussein had sent an emissary to Syria with instructions as follows : kirstly, that a Jihad should be proclaimed in Syria in the first place; in the event of the people of Syria being reluctant to act, the aid of the Turks should be invoked. Secondly, an invitation should be sent from Syria to Ibn Saud to lead the Jihad movement m his capacity as avowed champion of Islam. Thirdly, on the declaration of theJihad, action was to be directed, in the first place, against the French in Syria, and then against Mesopotamia. It was hoped that Ibn Saud would co-operate against Mesopotamia. Ibn Saud said that it was obvious that the Sherif hoped that he would be placed by t%above manoeuvre on the horns of a dilemma—if he joined the move ment he would/mieirate British support; if he held aloof the people of Nejd, to whom ^ro.g appeal would be made, would turn against him. He urged as a vital necessity that the following action should be taken at once 1. His Majesty s Government to guarantee at once in writing the maintenance of the existing status quo on the Fejd-Hejaz frontier. 2. His Majesty’s Government to guarantee at once in writing, that the Sherif would refrain from an aggressive policy. 3. The Mecca and Medina pilgrimage to be open to the people of Nejd and the safety of the Nejd pilgrims, whilst in the Ilejaz, to be assured. Pie undertook to guarantee that if the above undertakings were given by His Majesty s Government the peace of Arabia, so far as he was concerned, was assured, and neither incitement to J*diid nor Syrian intrigues would have the slightest effect on his people. In the third telegram the Civil Commissioner stated that he had now despatched the message contained in India Office telegram of the 24th January. He had also instructed the lolitical Agent, Bahrein, that, should Ibn Saud definitely negative the Kiea of visiting Hussein by sea at Jeddah, he should sound him whether he would be willing to meet him at some other place, such as Cairo or Aden. With regard to Ibn Saud s icquests, he said that he regarded Ibn Saud as being by far the strongest man in Arabia at present, and the least likely to lose his influence by reason of his attitude towards his Majesty’s Government. He considered his goodwill even more important now to His Majesty’s Government than that of King Hussein. The only solution he could see was that Ibn Saud should be informed in writing that Article 2 of the Treaty [3058] . c6 i ’ v r ■ || of the 26th December, 1915, applied equally to aggression hy King Hussein These three telegrams had all been repeated to Cairo, and on the 20th February the Foreign Office telegraphed to Lord Allenby for his views on the possibility of Hussein having taken the action alleged by Ibn Sand either before or after his own recent visit to (E 346) Jedd On the 20th February the Foreign Office received copies of two further telegrams V } from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, of the 12th and 15th February. In the first he detailed the instructions given by him to the Political Agent, Bahrein, an second he reported the Political Agent’s appreciation of the situation . / F 5 46 ) On the 23rd February the India Office, m consultation with the Foreign Office, authorised the Civil Commissioner to reply as follows to Ibn baud s three requests. 1. His Maiestv’s Government agreed that the existing status quo must oe main tained 'throughout the period of Ibn Sands absence at then invitation, from his own territory, and had informed King Hussein accordingly. 2 His Maiestv’s Government had already recognised their obligations to use every influence in their power to prevent encroachment on Ibn bauds territories. An encroachment by Hussein would, of course, come within the terms of this assurance, but 'His Majesty s Government were unable to satisfy themselves as to what constituted an encroachment, so long as the boundary between the two States remained undehmited, which it must necessarily be until the two rulers had arrived at an agreement. . 3 His Majesty’s Government shared with Ibn Sand his anxiety to see the Pilgrim route ipen to Mecca. It was for this reason that they were anxious to hasten the settlement of outstanding differences between himself and King Hussein. If after the receipt of this message Ibn Sand still refused to proceed to Jeddah or elsewhere to meet Hussein, the Civil Commissioner was instructed to inform him that His Maiestr’s Government had learned with great surprise of his hesitation to take steps the expediency of which they had always understood him to appreciate. If e still persisted in his refusal the Civil Commissioner was to sound him as to whether he would consent to go to Jeddah Port and interview Hussein on one of His Majesty s shins provided Hussein himself would consent to this course. , , P On the same day the India Office informed the Foreign Office that they regarded Colonel Wilson’s explanation as generally satisfactory in character, but t at t ey thought it desirable that he should be furnished with a clear expression of the views of His Majesty’s Government on the pafticular expressions employed by him m describing the political situation in Syria and the conditions in Sherif 1 \ eisa [ s ffi arrn [; Also on the 23rd February a telegram was received m the foreign Office horn Flis Majesty’s High Commissioner at Cairo, in which he said that he considered it most inadvisable to give Ibn Sand any such undertaking as that which had been demanded by him. On the 26th February the loreign Office repeated to Lord Allenby a telegram which had been despatched by the India Office m consultation with them on the 23rd February, and instructed him to inform Hussein that His Majesty’s Government expected him to preserve the status quo during Ibn bauds /F On the 27th February the Foreign Office concurred in a draft telegram from t e India Office to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, in which they pointed out a policy of His Majesty’s Government, which aimed at the maintenance ot peace between Ibn Sand and Hussein, and the discouragement of aggressive action on either side, seemed less likely to be achieved if either party were encouraged m tbe belief that his rivals were helpless. , j i i j • rvn o On the 3rd March Lord Allenby telegraphed that he had had no previo intimation of the charges brought forward against Hussein by Ibn au . e ^ pLi of Syria had little sympathy with Hussein, and the relations between hmr and ieisal were rather strained, so that it would be unlikely that the Sherif was at th any Jihad movement in Syria. At the same time, he was un ou e y y i rl ‘ l . | t eves of many Arab Moslems, and he would probably fee himself bound to repudiate anv partition of Syria, and to identify himself with the Syrian Nationa is s. H s previous loyalty inclined Lord Allenby to believe that he would take no action unlea forced to do so by circumstances, and that he still hoped for a so u ion w render possible the maintenance of his friendship with Great Britain. i m (E 922) On the 4th March Lord Allenby suggested that Hussein and Ibn Saud shou d ' ' meet in London, Hussein had already been invited to visit London, and Ibn Sa (E. 456) (E. 514) (E. 887)7 r^Tr) could hardly refuse an invitation of His Majesty’s Government. Such a meeting would havfc to take place in April to allow Hussein to return in time for the Pilgrimage. In the meanwhile a truce would be assured, and, to ease the situation, Hussein’s consent to allow the Pilgrimage from Nejd might be obtained. On the 5th March the foreign Office received copies of two telegrams from the (E. 1028) CiHI Commissioner, Baghdad, of the 24th February. In the first he reported that Ibn baud was anxious to comply with the expressed desires of His Majestv’s Government as regards a meeting with the Sherif, but that he could not meet him at Jeddah, Aden or Cairo. He would, however, agree to meet him either at Baghdad or at Bombay, provided :— 1. That Hussein met him in person. 2 . That he should not himself leave for Bombay until His Majesty’s Government had assured him that Hussein had left Jeddah. 3. That he was given a month for the settlement of important internal questions. This would enable him to leave Nejd on the 5th April. In the second telegram the Civil Commissioner expressed the opinion that Ibn bauds reply must be regarded as final, so far as Jeddah, Aden and Cairo were concerned. He did not think that the proposal for a meeting at Bombay or Baghdad could profitably be pursued, but suggested that both sides might agree to meet at Khurma or Turaba. This telegram had crossed the India Office telegram of the 23rd February, in which (E. 1089) a meeting was suggested on board one of His Majesty’s ships. On the 6 th March the Foreign Office pointed this out to the India Office, and suggested that strong pressure should be biought to bear upon Ibn Saud, with a view to his consenting to meet Hussein on board ship. On the 8 th March a despatch was received in the Foreign Office from His Majesty’s (E. 1154) High Commissioner at Cairo, in which he agreed that the statement made by the Nejd delegati( n on the subject of forcible conversions by the Akhwan should be communicated to King Hussein, and on the 12th March the Foreign Office authorised Lord Allenby to make this communication at his discretion. On the 10th March a telegram was received from Lord Allenby, in which he (E. 1286) enquired whether he should wait until it was definitely known that Ibn Saud had agreed to meet Hussein before informing the latter that he was expected to preserve the sfaiws quo, and on the 12th March the Foreign Office instructed him that he should make the communication at once, since Ibn Saud had already been informed that this was being done. -v? n March the Foreign Office received copies of a telegram of the (E. 1453) 3rd March from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, in which he stated that he had that day posted copies of interesting and valuable reports by the Political Agent, Bahrein, on his recent visit to Ibn Saud. and suggested that His Majesty’s Government should defer a decision on the proposed meeting between the two rulers until these reports had reached them. This telegram was repeated to Cairo, and on the 15th March a telegram was (E. 1452) received from Lord Allenby, in which he suggested that the Civil Commissioner should be instructed to telegraph the gist of these reports, since time was an important factor. fE e 16th March the Foreign Office received copies of a telegram of the (E. IbbS’' Ilth March from the India Office to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, in which they referred to their telegram of the 23rd February proposing a meeting on board ship. Ihey asked whether it was certain that Ibn Saud would reject this alternative. They also enquired what were Ibn Sand’s objections to Aden as a meeting place, and where le -was at that moment. In a reply dated the 13th March the Civil Commissioner said t at he had regarded it as certain that Ibn Saud would reject the alternative of a meeting on board ship. He understood from the Political Agent, Bahrein, that Ibn oaud s objections to Aden were that it was near Hussein’s territory and distant from ins own, and that he regarded Aden as being under the influence of the Egyptian authorities, who were pledged to support Hussein against Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud was on that day at Riadh, though he had intimated his willingness to leave that place for Hasa on the 5th April, in the event of Hussein agreeing to meet him at Bombav or Baghdad. On the 19th March the India Office telegraphed to the Civil Commissioner, (E. 2513) Baghdad, asking him for the gist of the reports of the Political Agent, Bahrein, and [3058J D8 r «fT V !

On the idtli April a telegram was received from Lord Allen by, in which he (E. 3012) rgneated his conviction that London was the best possible meeting place. 'The repor-ted sTf^d of the Akhwan movement was dangerous unless Hussein and Ibn Sand were reconciled without delay. The outlook of both rulers would be materially changed by a visit to England. On the 20th April a further telegram was received from Lord Allenby, in which (E. 3490) he repeated his suggestion that the two rulers should meet in London, and said that if this view were not adopted, and the meeting were to fall through, he regarded the situation with much misgiving. It was evident that neither Ibn .Sand nor his followers were prepared to accept indefinite exclusion from the pilgrimage, and the increasing strength of the Akhwan movement rendered it probable that they would overrun the Hejaz with results that would be disastrous to the reputation of His Majesty’s Govern ment amongst Moslems. 1 he best thing that could be done to prevent this was to persuade Hussein to allow the Pilgrimage from Nejd on condition that the pilgrims veie under the control of a headman, guaranteed by Ibn Sand to keep the peace and to abide by local regulations. Both parties should at the same time be warned of the serious view His Majesty’s Government would take of any trouble. Lord Allenby regarded this as a doubtful experiment in the present state of tension, and only put it forward as it was dangerous to let the matter slide. The only way of bringing about peace was to reconcile the two parties, and until this was done at a meeting between them troubles might occur at any time. He agreed that it would be undesirable to mvite Hussein to London and not Ibn Sand. .On the 21st April the foreign Office received a copy of a telegram of the 15th (E. 3520) April from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, in which he stated that fresh tribes continued to accept the leadership of I bn Sand, and that the Akhwan movement was being viewed with increasing complacence in Bahrein and along the TTucial Coast. He added that the probability of Ibn Sand seizing Mecca w r as being discussed very frankly in Bahrein, and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf and in Mesopotamia. The general opinion appeared to be not unfavourable to such a consummation, as it was believed that this would fie in the interests of religion and would make the Pilgrimage safer. As far as could be judged, the effect on Mesopotamia of the occupation of Mecca would not be unfavourable. ft might have a good effect on the Shiah priesthood. On the 2Gth April a telegram was received from Lord Allenby in which he (E. 3751) commented on this telegram from the Civil Commissioner, and inferred that the latter did not view wdth any great misgiving the reported spread of the Akhwan movement and the possibility of Ibn Sand overrunning the Hejaz. Lord Allenby trusted that tins was not the opinion of His Majesty’s Government. The conquest of the Hejaz would be a very definite blow to British diplomacy and would weaken the position of His Majesty s Government in the Moslem world. He felt strongly that every effort should be directed to maintaining Hussein upon his throne, and that if ibn Saud showed any tendency towards aggression, every possible means should be taken to prevent him. Un the 27th April the loreign Office received a letter from the India Office (py 3793 ) enclosing copies of despatches received from Mesopotamia, including the reports of the Political Agent, Bahrein. The India Office recommended that, in view of shipping difficulties, the proposal for a meeting between the two rulers should be abandoned, ^ eas ^ autumn. They pointed out, however, that the tr T ] 1 • re 3 ' ar ding the Pilgrimage this year must be faced at once, and suggested that His Majesty s Government, while leaving the question of the meeting of the two rulers to remain in abeyance, should urge both parties, both that the existing truce between them should be extended for the Haj, and that with mutual assurances of peaceful behaviour throughout the Pilgrimage on behalf of themselves and their followers, they should covenant for the reopening of the Pilgrimage. o/w\ l \ hi o • To, ‘A 3^2_ of i^he Civil Co:niriissioner. f? 8 | » ; BaghdadJ the 15th Harch 1920.

Dickson, in Hasa. I have the honour to state that you honoured me with your visit and we discussed with each other the circumstances which I rega,rd with apprehension and which interest both sides I may also mention that as you hear my son Daisal has returned from his journey on this date and has expressed deep gratitude to His Majesty the King Emperor ana His Majesty’s Government for the great regard and kindness shown him for which I offer my thanks to His Majesty the King Emperor and His Majesty’s Government. I conversed with them (Nejd Mission) in connexion with the discussions they had with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Right Honourable Lord Curzon, and my cousin and representatives Ahmad Al-Thanyan As-Saud informed me regarding the negotiations which took place between him and the aforesaid, of which you took a copy. After a conversation between me and the above mentioned, owing to some words, in the conversation which took place between him and the Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs, I was rather sorry, and my mind forbade me to do anything until I discuss and exchange views with the honourable Colonel Wilson, Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia,on this subject. The questions which made discussions difficult for me are firstly, the question of ’’ 'Tarabah” and ’’Khurma”; because Government Officials allege having evidence of Shareef’s possessionjof these; secondly, x the Interpreter who used to interpret during the time the meeting was held between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Mission was one taking the side of the Shareef, so that they even noticed excessive severe words in the dis cussions; thirdly, regarding t3jie subsidy: (It was said) ” We wont help you until you compromise with the Shareef”. As regards what they witnessed witn. their own eyes in the papers published under the signatures of the Officials of Egyptian Government, the who3.e of the news was about the Shareef and hi£statements and actions, of which the least is truth and the A greater part is falsehood, just likefown publications. They did not see any mention of my actions which I took for my friend, the High British Government. My actions, as I explained to your honour, ever since the time of my occupatior about 18 years ago, I have been communicating with the offici. als of the High British Government in the Persian Gulf, and the Turks bore me grudge and then they tried their best with Ibn Rashid and sent out troops with him and helped him financially in those days until he made them clear away and eradicated their rule from Arabian Peninsula and they helped Ibn Rabid with military forces, money, guns and ammunition. They also helped Shareef and moved him against my ITejd terri tories and the neighbourhood, and this is not hidden from the High Government. As I made friendship with the High British Government,! had the honour to interview the Honourable,,the then Chief Political Officer, Sir Percy Cox, and conclud.ed a treaty with him. He then requested me to fight Ibn Rashid in order that 1 he may not help the Turks and also when disputes arose bet ween me and the Shareef, as it is well known to the Honourable L.iic Chief Political Officer, Sir Percy Cox, he ordered me to desist from those disputes for the sale of the High British Government and therefore every thought or action that was excercising my mind was controlled and I began to help him in his fight against the TurJts, and did my best to see that Ibn Rashid did not attack the Shareef in Madina, furthermore, in accordance with a request from His Honour, I went to Basrah in order to confirm and strengthen my friendship with the Higl British Government and it was well known to^very body that I took a part in this great war and I complied with all the hints and suggestions of the above mentioned officer and when I returned to my territories I ordered all Najdis to h&amp;p the Shareef when the Shareef had only a small number of men to help him. The best tribes of Hajd are Ataibah, liarb and Mutair together with the people of Qasim and they helped theShareef and all the troops in battle-fields under hin command and that of his son were composed of my subjects, and I pre vented Ibn Rashid from taking the offensive against the Shareef, until I brought to my side the whole tribe of Sham- mar who left Ibn Rashid alone at ,, A1-Hajr' with only 200 men. An arrangement then took place between Shammar and myself to the effect that if Ibn Rashid, returned from Hajr they would fight with me and would follow the commands of the High British Government. I, therefore, desisted from attacking 'Hail” for this reason, in accordance wth the agreement which was concluded between me and Shammar in order to bring the whole lot to our side politically. \ 5 /hen Mr. Philby came to sjrk me after his return from journey in my territories he informed me that Government di rects me to declare war against Ibn Rashid in order that I may be included among the Allies and my assistance to the Shareef may also appear, which suggestion I welcomed and acc ordingly declared war and sent out troops to attack 'Hail^and when Ibn Rashid was badly pressed and the fall of ''Hail” was imminent hr. Philby informed me that Government forbids me from fighting Ibn Rashid which made me feel astonished as to y how I should give up my policy then and follow Government’s orders which forbid me from further fighting. Then myself and Mr. Philby returned is with the hope that we would get ar answer to our communication but we saw no result. Further- ^ more, when the Shareef made an aggression after the fall of Madina, I informed Colonel Wilson several times that the Shareef intends to trespass upon the boundaries of my terri- torries and I received a reply from him stating that it was impossible and that it shall not occur, but then the Shareef committed an aggressive act and I informed him accordingly several times, but I received no answer. When the Shareef advanced on to ’’Tarabah', and there was some deficiency in the fight, the inhabitants not having sufficient force, as their men were scattered about, and, consequently, the Shar eef was able to occupy ^hat town. he, afterwards, perse cuted the inhabitants in the mahfcer the Turjjs persecuted theArmenians which made them to cry out and excited the inhabi tants of the valley whey were in their vicinity, whom God helped against him and madd him run away and they took back ’’Tarabah” and I went to it. And I received $ etter from His MajestyVs representative at Jeddah which was not fit to be addressed to me from the High Government, Then I returned and informed all the people in Najd that His Majesty’s Government requested me to withdraw as the Shareef had begged them, and I was not expecting from Government except two things: firstly that they would remonstrate with the Shareef for his a,ggre- ssive acts against my territories; secondly, that they would help me in accordance with the treaty concluded between them and myself; but I saw nothing of this. On the contrary, they stopped the subsidy about which every body came to know. Furthermore, last year we intended to proceed to Mecca for the performance of n Haj” (pilgrimage), which is one of the most important duties of a Moslem, but the High Government reques ted me to give up the intention, which I did for their sake only, a nd po stponed, it for the next year, and afterwards gave it up entirely owing to Government having been very busy with War and Peace affairs. On the return of my son, Faisal A1 Abdul Aziz and Ahmad A1 Thanyan from their journey, they submitted to me copy of the conversation, and informed me that- they did not notice any mention of me in those quarters. This really displeased me and it is not through any fear of my reputation or any covetousness for the world that I desire this. My honour and reputation is patent to &amp;11, high and low and as for means of living, Almighty God alone is responsible therefor ; but then I percieved disregard and coolness incre%- sing in regard to all questions and my assistance and actions during the great war were not mentioned any where, as I have stated above, while the actions of others are mentioned in every conference and assembly of His Majesty’s Government* I am , therefore, afraid that lest, by negligence, any harm should occur or any evil movement should take place which I have explained to your honour now. God be praised I I amnot afraid of the enje'my; hut you know that the Arabs have rules and laws respecting their religion and their wordly affairs for neglect of which they become impatient if any of the same are ignored. By the grace of God, all the inhabita of my territories and my subjects at large are M Bidais M (devoted to me) in person and property, heart and soul, for the sake.of their religion, homes and honour. And I am afraid if the matters which are pending between me and the Shareef are not settled with extreme hurry, then the enjoined in our religion () might take place. Ho one has coveted my country, which is my own from early days and now if any thing untoward takes place, the responsibilit 3 T might be laid at my door, or I might be considered insincere by my friends, the ^igh Government^ I have, however, full trust that your honour will put before Colonel Wilson the above-noted state ment . 3 03The Under-Secretary •Ststfte for India, London, S.W.l (2 copies), The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla.

As you know I am always anxious to follow the advice of your Government,But you are aware that r as I told you personally,! have to go back to Riyadh to meet some of my tribal headmen and to go out touring espitially for settling some of their tribal affairs.! gave them a - promise,on your departure,that I shall return soon. Moreover in view of my meeting with the Shariff as desired by His Majesty’s Government,it is necessary for me to make certain arrangements,as I did not give sufficient instructions when leaving my capital.lt is necessary for' the settlement of someAur internal affairs that I should return to Riyadh. As regards your communication,under orders of His majesty’s Government,that it is most essential that I should meet the Shareef in one of the places mentioned,I can only say that I have always been following the advice and comply ing with the requests of His Majesty’s Government in all - matters, I have,however,fully explained to you personally all that I have in mind.I have no wish or need to meet the Shareef;but I would do so simply to conform to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government, As regards the place of meeting you mention Jeddah; while Civil Commissioner asks if Cairo or Aden will suit. Being anxious as I ami to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government I cannot possibly consent to meet the Shareef in either Jeddah,or Cairo,or Aden. Bahrain. As to Jeddah : it will be the greatest derogation |W of my rights (position) to go to Shareef’s own town and meetsfe^gg urn, i. ■ ■ him there,I personally think that even if I myself were an^itms to meet the Shareef in Jeddah,His Majesty*s Government would not suffer me to do so owing to so serious a derogation of my honour* (3?B) As to Cairo : You are aware of the reasons I have for thinking that it is unsuitable for my meeting the Shareef* If His Majesty*s Government prefers that .I should meet Shareef,then I,personally,would like that the meeting be - arranged at Baghdad* But if this is not possible,then I should take upon myself the trouble and hardship of sea-voyage for pleasing His - Majesty*s Government,provided the middle place between both of us,being also a British port,namely Bombay is fixed for meeting which would otherv/ise be only impossible. This too is subject to the condition ohat Shareef Husain meets me in person and not by one of his sons or attorney* I shall not move out until - Shareef himself moves out of Jeddah,when I shall start for Indi£ ihis should be guaranteed to me by His Majesty*s Government, As regards friendly settlement and peace between the Shareef and myself,! leave it to His Majesty's Government to ma].ce arrangements on my behalf if he( Shareef) offers to make any arrangements for the meeting.As regards the time of the meeting: it is necessary for me to remain one month in Hejd, and you know what the journey from Hejd to Kassa and thence to Bahrain is like. You may please settle the matter and then - inform me wnat I snould ao,as I mean to please His Majesty’s Government. I await your reply and on receiving it,can proceed to Hassa on 15th Rajab 1338( 5th April,1920) I hope you will convey this telegraphically to Colonel Wilson,Ci^il Commissioner,Baghdad,for submitting to His - Maje sty * s Government, Usual ending.■SUP' Draft Paper. i Departmen A Foreign Office. .

Sir, In continuation of correspondence ending with my letter dated April 15th No.P.2674, I am directed by the (T'_ oL.'u Secretary of Stated to forward for submission to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs^ copy of the marginally noted despatches which have been received from Mesopotamia relating to the dispute between King Hussein and Bin Saud. In his telegram dated 29th March '3917” Colonel Wilson requested an assurance that Shipping facilities would be available before he pressed Bin Saud to consent to a meeting by sea. It has been impossible hitherto to give this assurance as H.M. 'Lawrence II', the only suitable ship, has, at the request of Earl Curzon of Kedleston, been retained for thereturn journey of the Shah of Persia: and will not be available till the end of May. Mr.Secretary Montagu considers that’ the season will then be too far advanced for the proposed meeting to be feasible; and he feels himself forcedr { forced with great reluctance to recommend that the scheme be abandoned, if not permanently, at least till the dlutumn. But if the solution of the boundary problem can be postponed, it is j increasingly certain that the difficulty, i regarding the pilgrimage this year must be faced at once. In India Office telegram of Februaryl&amp;ad (1.1264) Bin Baud was assured of the anxiety of . His Majesty 1 s Government that the pilgrim route should be open for his followers and all Moslems this year: and from the correspondence which is forwarded with this letter, it would seem that there is grave danger that the Aichpn will journey to Mecca hy force if not by consent. Mr.Montagu would therefore suggest for the consideration of His Lordship that His Majesty’s Government, v/hile allowing the question of the meeting of the Chiefs tp decide the boundary dispute to remain in abeyance, should urge on both parties both that the existing truce between them should be extended over the Hajj and that, with mutual assurances of peaceful behaviour throughout the pilgrimage on behalf of themselves and their followers, they should covenant for the re-opening of the pilgrimage. If His Lordship concurs in this course, Mr.Montagu would suggest that identical telegrams might be despatched to Cairo and Mesopotamia. Wo) J. E.

He meant it from his heart and hoped no offence would be taken. The advice was given in the first person and was as near as possible in the following words* (a) Grant Byria independance, if you can see your way to do so, at once, otherwise you English should yourselves rule over her destinies but with strong firm hand, standing no nonsence of any kind from her people. In any case if the Sharif retains his hold over Syria or she is granted autiJonomy never let the Arabs get hold of the sea-port town of Beyrout.

My first act were I to rule over the Moslems of Arabia as a whole would be to order all to dis continue smoking and drinking.

Januaryl;29th. Sent kit round to Budaiyeh N.W.comer of Island by night in a small boat* Rode over on horseback in morning (distance 15 miles) and joined my kit. After having coffee v/ith Shaikh Abdullah al Dosari, boarded a dhow (Mahmal) at noon set sail from Budaiyeh with a strong North wind behind us« Arrived Ojair 6.30 P.M. Could not have done journey in shorter time. Was met by Customs official Makki ibn Hasan and welcomed by Amir Abdel Rahman with a guard of 50 Arabs. These were well armed with 303 (long) rifles and looked a serviceable looking body of men, all pure Nejdis. In evening I dined alone. No camels arrived. January 30th . Lunched with Amir Abdel Rahman. Still waiting for my camels from Hufuf. News arrived this evening that uncle of Abdul-Aziz al-Qusaibi, Bin Saud ! s Agent who was accompanying me, had died in Hufuf. Abdul-Aziz greatly upset. Also news came in that Bin Saud had not yet arrived from Nejd. Probably shall set out tomorrow. Camels for kit and 8 beautifully- caparisoned dromedaries arrived 6.30 P.M. with escort to take me to Hassa. January 31 . Left Ojair 7.30 A.M. arrived Busaitin or TJMM-SL-THUR 10.50 A.M. distance about 12 miles. Had hHad breakfast pro- oeeded 11.30 A.M. to Braiman arriving 2 P.M. distance 10 miles. Large water pool due to recent rains at UMM-EL-THUR. Water everywhere found at Umm-el-Thur and Braiman by digging 2 feet. Few stunted palms at each place, otherwise wild sandy desert on all sides as far as eye can see with no visible track anywhereanywhere. High aand dunes some of them as much as 100 feet high to be seen on all sides. Saw the famous horseshoe-shaped dunes for the first time. Pace walking and trotting gave us an average of about 4 miles an hour. We left some four miles on our right flank the prominent sand-hill called Jebel Gahdi- yeh at which spot about 9 years ago the AL-MURHA tribe aided by the MAITASIR Bedouin captured a Turkish convoy of 4000 kxgH to camels which were from Ojair^aasd Hassa. All the members of the escort were killed or captured and the convoy which was a very rich one taken. Received message on road from Bin Saud to effect that he was not arriving at Hassa till 1st February (Monday). Decided, therefore, to move to Jishoh and there await the Imam’s (Bin Baud’s) arrival. I think it will create good impression. Jisheh 12 miles this side (East) of Hufuf. Five Arabs have been sent us by Ibn Jiluvx as escort. All good lads. One knows Khamisiyeh well, his name is BUTI• He says he v/as with Yousuf Bey al- Mansur, fighting against us at Shuaibaho He fled after battle to Hassa doing the journey in 6 | days. A fine lad, very proud of his English]^ rifle. Showed me how he could shoot. It is a wonderful sight to see our guard who are Akhwan calling the faithful to prayer and beating up slack members at prayer time. All seems to be done with military precision and order. The guard appear to be fervent Akhwans all of them. Learnt much from Mahomed our escort leader about the movement. During day met thousands of camels travelling slowly from South to North Hassa. This is the annual migration of Hassa tribes to better grazing grounds. The sight reminded one of the annual move of the Dhafi in Muntafifc from the Shett-al-Kar to the desert. Have seen quite 20,000 camels today. They are Manasir, Al-Murrah (not Ahl Murra) as books say, Bani Khalid, a few Sabei, few Qahtan and Bani Hajar. As they move they graze between sand dunes where there is good deal of coarse grass to be found. Mahomed states these tribes go up to borders of Kuwait and return again in about four months. A report is going about that the Sharif hashas heen assassinated. My escort is very friendly and wonder fully proud of their Iman. Enthusiasm for their leader and contempt for the Sharif is evident in almost every word they utter, i'hey are full of spirit and good moral. The contempt these Akhwan have for Shiahs and Baharanah in general is inter esting. In Hassa Shiahs are not allowed to celebrate Hussain*s death in the way they do in Basrah nor are they allowed to call to prayer. . Both are also forbidden to sell rifles or ammuni tion or to possess them. There appears to be a continuous and regular traffic between Ojair and Hassa. Dozens of cara vans go back and forward between Ojair and Hufuf now-a-days in perfect safety. So much for Ibn Jiluvi’s strong rule. This as compared with a few years ago is a wonderful change. Trade with Bahrain is astonishingly large. O.jair customs charge on all goods entering Bin Saud’s territory. Ojair and Qatif are farmed together. During 1920 ? the farm was worth seven lakhs of rupees to the Imam. 1st February. Left Braiman 8.50 A.M. reached Subkha Well 12.50 distance 14 miles. Halted half hour, left again 1 P.M. travelling fast reached Jisheh south-east comer of Hassa Oasis 6 P.M. distance 26 miles. We were met outside the town by Amir Ali and other headmen, also by the members of the Qusaibi family. Carpets had been spread on a hill overlooking the town and we were refreshed by sweetmeats and coffee. The first sight of Hassa resembles that of Damascus though not so fine. It is an emerald in a setting yellow sand while in the centre rises the massive though low mountain of OARA. Hature of the C ountry cr os sed . After Braiman aand dunes were less frequent and we came across regular continuous firm depressions which made going easy for our camels. 5 miles before reaching Subkha one came upon wide gravelly plain with little sand patches in the middle, this depression or plain afforded good grazing for camels. High sand dunes were visible to North and South, about 5 miles distancedistance* At Subkha water was found everwhere at two feet from surface* It was drinkable but very salty* Al-Subkha is long flat depression about six miles in length covered for about 4 miles with water to depth of 4 inches* This is rain water, but is not sweet owing to salty nature of sand* Whenever there is rain, I was told, this depression fills with water* My escort tell me that three days ago depth of water was 2 feet* Just before reaching Hassa, the sand dunes once again assumes T 4 - anormous proportions, their shape being horseshoe-like this. For first sight of Hassa see sketch 'B'* At Jisheh we spent the night in the house of Amir Ali who received us very kindly*After good night we left Jisheh 8•30 A.M. paving been invited by Ibn Jiluvi the Amir of Hasea by mounted messenger to come on to Hufuf• I had sent Ibn Jiluvi word the night before, that I was halting until Imam entered Hufijf. Bin Jiluvi, however, invited na in saying it was not known definitely at what time the Imam would arrive. From Jisheh &gt;&lt; we rode at a walking pace to Hufuf (See sketch W C W ). Time c&gt;r taken 3 hours. I was struck with the beauty of the many gardens All are splendidly tended and contained an abundance of fruit trees. Water channels were numerous and in many places the roadway was built up on a raised causeway* Over the stream were good well-built masonry bridges, averaging 8 feet wide, some as narrow as 5 feet* Every now and then open spaces occurred among the palm gardens, showing wide expanses of rice fields (now of course under water). Generally speaking country side very much like Suk-esh-Shuyukh, Mesopotamia minus the river, and with gardens in much more highly cultivated condition. Along the whole road to Hufuf wherever the ground was high, was to be seen the brilliant green denoting wheat cultivation. It is evident Hassa - produces much wheat and rice. A row of Turkish guard houses exist in more or less ruined condition from Jisheh to Hufuf and were an eloquent testimony to the state of affair existing in the Turkish times* Al- Qusaibi told me as we rode along that there were daily raids and robberies on this strip even though the road ran along side the date gardens. Each village we came to had a wall round it with towers showing how unsettled the country must have been. We arrived at Hufuf at length and were met by a large crov/d outside the chief gate. The scene remin^ded me forcibly of my first entry into Shatra. The town is not dissimilar in appearance, but is larger and better built, with conspicuous walls rather in a tumbledown condition, but once obviously very strong. They are still very massive and high where they enclose the H Kut w or Government quarters. TheThe city is built as per rough sketch below* It has an outer wall, an inner wall f * {- / -o 1 enclosing the Government quarter and an inner keep enclosing the great mosque* It must have been quite a strong place originally when Bin Saud captured Hufuf* He got over wall on dark night at points x x X using rope etc* Sentries on wall were alert but not heeding their shots the storming party olimed over the walls and gained possession of the inner enclosure* Bin Baud’s force is said to have been 3,000 men* The alarmed garrison bolted into the keep* The next thing that happened was the City surrendered after which the garrison followed suit* The Wali and the General Officer Commanding force with about 1,000 men were given 5 days to auction their effects. This they did e and marched out with their rifles and accountrments* They were escorted to Ojair by Bin Saud* This coup (fle main from all accounts was a well thought out and cleverly carried out movement* After entering the town we lunched and dined with Ibn Jiluvi both meals being of the HB&amp;xfc usual Arab type. The Amir himself refused to eat with us in spite of being pressed* Iromediately after each meal, the party dismissed, and contrary to all Arab Custom not even coffee was served* Bin Jiluvi adopts an untidy dirty garb probably in imitation of Akhwan his Agal was tom and his Abba old and shabby. He is in looks and manner of speach rather like Khayun al Obeid of Shatra except that he has a full beard. Bin Jiluvi struck me as a good type of the Arab strong man. He has a jovial jolly countenance* FEBRUARY j 3rd* Spent morning receiving guests and callers, sent Farhanal-Bahama to pay respects to Amir.

Bin Baud is well and comes —— (34'S; with 500 to 1,000 men and a couple of sons. After he went Qusaibi told me the story of how Bin Baud captured Hufuf and Riadho Both were clever strokes Hufuf’s capture a regular military coup de main, proving the Imam to be by no means a bad leader. FEBRUARY 4th. Spent quiet morning receiving callers. Bin Baud arrived 2.30 P.M. Sent word that he would receive me at once. Paid 1 official call at 3. P.M. He is splendid man, completely over shadows all his followers. I should say he was man of strong character and overweening ambition. Saw many Akhwan in his strain. Wild looking individuals who do not deign to return a salaam but cover their faces with both hands as £ou pass. It is well for me I am under Bin Baud’s protection. I would not trust myself a yard with some of his crew. Bin Baud after a few words of welcome, began a sermon in theatrical style speaking towards me but obviously for the benefit of his people. He took the Turk, for his text, and quoted the Koran and thq various Caliphs over and over again. The Turks were this, were that, were everything else. It was interesting to see how every word that fell from, his lips, was literally drunk in by his ( followers. It is clear that Bin Baud, whatever his real belief is - absolutely leads, and leads under the name of Religion. He explained how Nejd, the home of the Arabs and of the pure - bred, and only true Moslems, was the chosen of God. God’s will was that those Moslems who had strayed from the path, here he mentioned Koweit, Hejaz, Syria, were to be brought back to the fold through the pure teachings and influence of Nejd and the Akhwan. The whole scene reminded me of the Sannusi and one of their religious meetings which I once attended, but it was grander and finer. Bin Baud then turned to me and said 'perhaps/ you English don’t know what the Akhwan are'. I am the Akhwan' he shouted, and I am the slave of God the most merciful. His dramatic finish was received with murmers of 'Allah i towil amarak ya etc etc.' I left Bin Baud at about*, 4*15, and at 4*30 he returned my call. Most gracious he was' to me and quite different from the bigot of half an hour before. He discoursed on most things but through it all ran the vein that he believed he was the Redeemer of Islam. I have never seen Bin Saud before, but his beard is quite long now and I am told he looks much older. He certainly is a man. every inch of hira&gt; and has a delightful smile which he continual ly uses. He is the type of man. that makes simple men go mad. On this return visit Bin Saud sat a full hour talking on various subjects. FEBRUARY 5th. At 9.30 A.M. I called again on Bin Saud. The room was full of visitors. Shaikhs of all the tribes around. Bin Saud told me the A.jman were present there but not all. He hoped soon to see ibn Hathlain. (It was a false story which said he had already ©ome in). He believed the latter would be in very shortly. He had been asked to pardon the whole tribe and he had decided to do so. He discoursed on the wonderful civilizing influence at work in Nejd. The Akhwan movement had been responsible for close on 50 new cities, each ranging from 8,000 to 30,000 inhabitants* God was truly working a miracle he said. Raiding, killing, stealing etc etc were all done and finished with. On all sides letters were pouring in asking him to lead the new movement into new countries. Hadramant, femen, Oman, frucial Coast, Anaze and Sharamar, had he said all sent letters offering their services, all wished to become Akhwan. 1,2,3,4 he ha d riot a^ i^ped remembering his friendship with us 5 and 6 he had answered offering all and sundry an asylum in Nejd if they would join the movement of God. He said most of the Shammar had joined the faith and were now building cities. Bin Rachid himself and a few of his people still lived as Bedouin and could not be pExsasa persuaded to join the chosen °f God. He was on the friendliest of terms with Bin Rachid he said/the latter had agreed that those Shammar who cared to * , Tadaiyan M and build cities could recognize Bin Saud, as their ~ spiritual head and he wouldn’t object. I recognized of course thatthat a great deal of his big talk was w hakki diwan i.e. meatlt^ for the public ears* He said that 300,000 rifle men were &gt;■’ now at his beck and calli He had only to say 'Jehad* and the whole of Arabia would blaze. (l saw a veiled threat in this) At the end of the meeting I asked for a private interview. This was at once granted. I conversed for 2 hours on confident- a ial matter. This converstion will be reported separately. I left the audience chamber at l.P.M. and at 3 rode to the hot springs 4 miles from Hufuf. A pretty sight. Water quite hot many people bathing including several pretty women discretly garbed. At 5 P.M. I returned to write my despatch to Baghdad. Most difficult to put all Bin Baud said in report form. He dealt with so many subjects and talked such a lot. Hufuf is now full of the wildest looking Bedouin I have ever set mg ysss eyes on. They are mostly Manesir, A1 Hurrah Bani Yas, Bani Hajir and Qahtan tribesmen. Wilder than anything I have yet seen. My presence in Hufuf of course causes much gossip and not a little staring. Bin Baud and Bin Jiluvi are kindness itself, and could not be more hospitable. I am allowed to purchase nothing in the food line and an armed guard and 5 personal servants are at my disposal from morning till night. Qusaibi also cannot do enough for me. Yufiuf Kanoo is a host in himself. FEBRUARY 6 th. Again spent quiet morning working at telegrams. In afternoon Imam called on me and sat for 1 hour explaining his methods of Government, and telling me of his wars with Bin Kachid the Turks and recalcitrant^ Arabs. His story of the captures of Riadh and Hufuf were very interesting. The former ran as follows. He left his standing camp in the Batin between Kuwait and Hail as a bait for Bin Rachid. He knew the latter was moving to round him up, he himself with 40 men by long and strenuous marching one fine day fatched up at Riadh. He entered the town secretly and seized the house next to that in which was the wife of the Commander of the castle. That night his party entered the ladies house and occupied it till dawndawn. At 6.30 A.M. the castle gate opened and the Amir or Commander came out, and after looking at horses strolled \ towards his ladies house. Bin »aud then rushed out and follow' ed the Amir as he entered the castle, killing him on door step forcing an entrance over his dead body. The capture of Hufuf has ‘been described above so I won’t repeat it. In tribal raids Bin Baud said he been as far as Jebel Akhdar Oman, and several times to Jabrin Oasis chiefly in pursuit of the A1 Hurrah, the toughest lot he had to deal with into the Rubah al Khali and for months and months never drank water only camel milk etc etc. He told me that among these tribes paying Zikat were the Maanasir Ban! Yas, and Al Ali of Oman. By paying Zikat they got protection from their enemies This was one of Bin Baud’s strong points. The A.lman he hoped would soon be in. Regularly, traders he said came from Hadramant and Yemen via lie,']ran and many were the letters from Oman, Trucial Coast, Hadramant offering loyalty. He had answered none owing to his friendship with England. The Anaze had recently written him offering homage: The fact that he insisted on the purest form of Mahomedanism, and enforced Sheria Law in its fullest extent was drawing all to his standard he said. In the evening I dined with Bin Baud and found him as charming a host as few could find in the world. 1 I Prom beginning to end he showed me nothing but courtesy: I am distinctly impressed. As a man and a ruler he towers over the I : heads of his people. He is a remarkable individual and born leader. Intensely ambitious I should say, he scarcely knows his limitations: the danger is that he will be carried away by the Religious frenzy of his Akhwan. He outwardly appears a fanatic. It is difficult to say if he is really such a | person. FEBRUARY. 7th. Friday interviewed the Imam at 2.30. Talked on all subjects. His attachment for us English is almost pathetic. ■vMUaxgaftJBW/* -t? ? crack.

All were well armed either with Hauser, Manlicher or .303 rifles. Cartridges all of pointed bullet kind. They wore the white turban over their kuffaiyah. FEBRUARY 6 th . Sunday. In the morning I called on Shaikh Mohamed al Saud brother of the Imam. Fine physique but dull. Afterwards called on Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Mahomed Imam’s sons. Abdullah had too much say for himself - the small boy was charming. 12 noon went to Qusaibi’s garden and had lunch and tea. Delightful spot. .Manager Ha.ji Ibrahim al Qusaibi, uncle of Abdul Aziz.

Ajman Shaikhs were again there all had come in to ask forgiveness. Bin Saud explained that they deserved to be killed for all their misdeeds and their treachery In Bin Rachid’s war, in the Hassa war and then for taking refuge in Kuwait territory. He was however willing to forgive all the past, but Bin Hathlain must come in. and Syria within two months, and then what a friend you would have in me you English', he said. In the evening I went for A1 l A special messenger was sent to bring hin 0 The Ajman question seems now nearly settled. To-day I was introduced to the Amir of passim* Afterwards the Imam counted and game me names of 55 new cities built by Akhwan: He told me that Ridden Walad, Schail of Hamala al Suvait of Dhafit had come to see him also that Halal bin Misiar al Suwait and Asi al Suwait with 10 men had settled in Riadh as Akhwan© He praised the British for refusing to give sanctuary to A^rnan near Safv/an. He said results are best proof of British policyI Ajman were now all anxious to come in. He claimed that all the Bedouin^ tribes (Badia) of Arabia were now under his protection and acknowledged him, excepting his good friends the Dhafir who were definitely under English and were recognized as such by him. At 10.30 A.M. Received in my house following callers. Abd al Aziz Al Qusaibi, Yusuf Kanoo, Fahad al Bassam, Mahomed al Fahad al Bassam, Shaikh Jassim of Darin and several promi nent merchants. Afternoon received call from Bin Saud who sat for one hour, afterwards went to Hot springs (Sufjpher) al Ain He,jin 3 miles N.W. of Hufuf. Wonderful sight. Could scarcely bear finger in water. Clirnpd hill 400 feet high N.W. of town 3 miles away, g$t splendid view of whole of Hassa oasis, took sketches of some and in evening I dined with Harrisons’. FEBRUARY 11th . Wrote report to Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, in the morning, afternoon called Fahad al Bassam and learnt all about family. These consist of: Ali al Abdullah al Bassam at Kuwait (eldest) Mahomed al Abdullah al Bassam at Damascus Fahad ' ' ' ' at Haasa (waa in Baarah and I gather that Mahomed al Bassam in Damascus is the source from which Bin Saud gets all his Syrian news, also that much Turkish Bulaiman M « very pro-Turk at one time) n n at Bahrain. Ibrahim tt « n at ZobairTurkish ammunition has been recently received by Bin Saud from Damascus&lt;» To-day family appear devoted to Bin Baud’ After my call, I spent half an hour with Bin Saud over the great gate overlooking the market* Bin Saud was very courteous and asked much after Mr.Philby* Discussed Bedouin customs, features and racial traits of the wild tribes of Hassa FEBRUARY 12th . Me,-jd mission arrived. Bin Saud greatly elated at his at sons return and/ Hb appearance generally. The letters of King George gave him infinite pleasure, and he made me road it several times* The jarring note was not however absent. Bin Saud after reading the Notes of a conversation between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Arabian mission representing Bin Saud (Dated 26th November 1919) an Arab copy of which Ahmed bin Thanaiyan had brought, became very despondent* He sent for me, and I have not found him so down in the mouth before* He commenced by saying that he had not said his prayers that morning, nor had he paid attention ( to the sermon in the Mosque* He made me read the notes, and I think he had reason to be despondent© Lord Curzon , s remarks were unnecessary I think seeing that the Turraba abd Kurma subject is still w sub judice'. I am sure the notes would not ' have been^foreseen. The net result is that Bin Saud is more | convinced than ever that the Home Government is listening to ^talk from Egypt and not from Mesopotamia, (his words). He is iconvinced his backing in London is poorer than that of the IShareef• He is very bitter today. Hio bitterness may be I embodied in the followings (1) He knows now Shareef gets £.20,000/- Why should he who recently helped them out of financial difficulties Mahomed in Damascus might be watched. ^ n L ... i j UU&lt;4 ..i,ijiiiii&gt; i * | i&gt;ii 'ii (2) Bin Thanaiyan states their reception was not nearly so much advertised as was that of Amir Faisal bin(3) He says he is quite sure that Egypt’s Councils are heard in London and those of Mesopotamia and India are not. The above are, he says, the rewards of his obeying the wishes of His Majesty's Government and keeping quiet, and asking Baghdad to fight his battles* The policy of shouting i * Ifrom the housetops and self advertisement// is obviously the pbest (his words), Ahmed bin Thanaiyan regaled the Imam with many stories, a few of his ideas are worth repeating* He was full of Mr. Montagu's greatness and his love for Moslem. He had everything bad to say of Lord Curzon* Major Young,D.S.O. who acted as interpreter was without tact, was rude and prejudiced in favour of the Shareef* He (bin Thanaiyan) asked for Philby to interpret, but was rudly refused, and Major Young was introduced instead, the moment that officer opened his mouth and spoke of the Shareef as ' Saiyidina ' he at once sized him up, he said* The above is the type of news that Bin Baud simply drank in* Today he reminds me of Saul in his rage |I wonder who the David will be - FEBRUARY 13th* ' Preparation pre departure* Have given many presents to Bin Saud's men, and to those of Bin Jiluvi* I am leaving tomorrow. In private Majlis Bin Saud said to me 'Why won't you English understand the situation. Why won't you realise facts? Don't you know that Shareef is an absolute traitor? and is also loathed by all moelems. You are supporting a broken pillar. On contrary I am desired everwhere* Hajez and Syria are mine for the asking. The inhabitants of these places have begged me come and rule over them. As sure as I hold this stick (he suited action to the word) so sure do I know 1 h e Shareef's days are numbered* I have only to go to Taif and he would be murdered. I would never actually attack Mecca itself, there would be no need to comit such a sacrilege. J Q. 1 , 1 Mecca is behind me already. FEBRUARY 14th. Today my servants all received various forms of presents fromfrom the Imam* I cam© in for my share. At noon we ast set' \ out for Jisheh amidst a great send off* We spent night at J Jisheh, where we again were hospitably received by Amir Ali. On morning 15th we started at 7. A.M. and travelling fast reached Ojair sun down. 6.50 P.M. a good 40 miles very tired, most of journey was done at jog-trot which on Dromedaries is none too comfortable* Incidentally one of the Escort Marzuk by name was the chief executioner in Hassa* He told me Ibn Jiluvi had fixed Thursdays for executions* These were done in public in the Market place and the body left till night-fall* He himself had decapitated 22 men and had cut off the hands of scores. The latter proeess he grimly said did not hurt but what did make men cry out was putting the severed stump into boiling fat* Marzuk l?sib believed that fact that execu^tions had become rare these days, owing to the fear with which Ibn Jiluvi was held. One interesting story he told me typical of Bin Jiluvi*s methods* A man came and reported to Bin Jiluvi uhat. he had seen a bag of coffee lying on high road between Riadh and Hasaa but within the latter’s borders. Bin Jiluvi threupon asked him how he knew it was coffee, the wretched man, * said M I kicked the bag and so knew it to be coffee”! Well then said Ibn Jiluvi w Dont be curious in future and kick any more bags in the Imams high way, off with his right big toe'. Marzuk did the needful. we set out next morning for Bahrain where we arrived on evening 19th after most wretched voyage - contrary winds hindered us the whole way. I would have given anything for a steam launch or R.I.M.S. 'Lawrenbe'. 20th resumed v/ork in Bahrain. Sd/- H.R.P. Dickson, Major,0.I.E.

I have spent November in receiving calls from leading Shaikhs and notables cf the town and returning same - also I have done much reading cf files in an endeavour to make myself acquainted with the political situation cf Bahrain and mainland. I have been rather handicapped by having had no British officer to taloe over from and explain to me the many intricate points of local policy - Things were made extra difficult by the fact that the Indian Assistant went sick as soon as I arrived and took 10 days’ leave into the interior of the I s 1 md • Thi s me ant th at I h ad to find out much f or myself which otherwise I should have learnt in ordinary course of carversaticn with my predecessor.

TRIBAL AFFAIRS. 151. (a) N a j d • News regarding the Akhwan movement con- tinuea to be satisfactory. Ibn Baud, the”Iraam ,T 0 is reported to be definitely getting the upper hand of the movement, though he is still nominally l&amp;ads it. Recently according to a report given me by Abd el Aziz al Qusaibi ( Ibn Saud's agent in Bahrain) the Iman xaifc held a grand Durbar of Shaikhs at Riath and in a striking speech swore that lie would slay anyone who attempted to spread the Akhwan beliefs either by H© forcible means, or outside the confines of N a 3 dHe drew his sword, it is said and in dramatic fashicn called God tc witness that he intended what he said. He further told his Amirs that over the question of Tar aba and Khurma, his sole Object was peace. Live and let live was his motto. He had not idea cf aggrVdisement, nor did he ¥/ish in any way to extend the ccnfines of Najd - all he insisted cn was the inviolability cf the present boundaries cf Najd. Further that in all matters he intended tansuiting his good friends the British Government, and that he relied on them to see justice done . (b) Latest news from the Imam (received 4th December and for warded to C J3 . Baghdad) is t o the effect that the Sh&amp;reefs sens Ali and Abdullah are at TaLf with 600 troops and are “trailing their coat, tails” • This is a pity if true in view cf the apparently impetais natures of the Amirs cf Tarab 1 and Hiurma* (c) m interesting piece cf news that Abd el Aziz Al Qusaibi gave me , is that the Amir Khalid is cf the same family as the Shereef: This may account for tbe special form cf hatred that waild appear to exist between the two. (d) Hass a* This province is entirely quiet - On all hands one hears praise for the way in which it is administered. The Imam*s uncle rules with an iren hand, but is just and popular. The road from Oj air (Oqair) toHoffuf the capital cf Hass a and cn t o Hi ath is entirely safe now-a-days and robberies are conspicuous by their absence. (e) Qatif. Is reported to, as unhealthy as ever but from all I can gather it is the town that is the bad spot not the country side. Proper sanitation would probably make Qatif a he alth resert. (f) The Ajman tribe who have been for so long in Ibn Sands bad books, are reported to have recently made overtures to the Imam and to be now returning to make their submission: My informant is Abd el Aziz Al Qusaibi, Ibn Baud's agent here. (g) Qatar. There is no news cf import. It is hoped thethe recent request of the Ruler of Bahrain through hi# Abdullah that Zub^a he ceded back to him, will not be lisTShed to* To revive the old bene of* contention woild not be a wise move. Old files have shown that neither Colonel Felly nor Mr. Gaskin at one time Politicals in these parts approved the claims of the Shaikh of Bahrain to territory on the Qatar peninsula. , and even though Major Prideaux later took the opposite view, he put it on record that Zub/a itself should never be re-occupied. I have reported on this matter on 6th December in another letter. mumici Palit y ^f airs . 152. The sanitary state of both Manama and Muharraq Islands is very bad indeed. The latter place can be 3,eft a^side, as it is scarcely ever visited by Europeans and it is Turely an Arab Town. Re@&gt;&amp;rding the former place the least said the better. I dent think I have ever struck anything so filthy and loathsome as the st&amp;te of Man am* streets . No effort what so ever appears to be made by the Shaikh to clean up the place refuse of every kind snd in every stage of decay lies about unremoved, while the inhabitants male and female seem to make a habit of using the streets for their latrines. I have expostulated with Mr. Yousuf lionoo the nominal head of the Municipality • He tells me he is quite helpless in face of the steady opposition of Shaikh Isa, and his advisers. Mr. Yousuf Kanoo yesterday resigned all connection with the Municipality from sheer disgu^st at the apathy shown by Shaikh Isa. I hope as soon as I have found my legs a bit to take up this question of sanitation serjbcusly • If I find the Shaikh still hopeless I shall report the matter to higher authority and hbpe I Mhall be supported • The danger of an epidemic under present conditions is very real. I can honestly say the foul state of Manama beats anything I have ever come across in Mesopotamia by a very long way. Not only is the place dirty but the inhabitants are far less sanitary in their habits than the people of Iraq is not saying much.155* (a) Wh have roughly 8 n| upward mail every 8 days and a d own ward mail every 14 days.

(he hopes as shipping is released that Bahrain will get its share of more steamers. S .S J 1 Palitana' arrived today Sunday 7th and leaves for Basrah tomorrow 8 th. (b) I still have complaints of grave over-crowding on the British India coastal steamers. I personally witnessed m instance of this on my journey here from Basrah. (hr ship the ' Faljat sna' was authorised to carry somewhere ab cut 6 00 deck passengers but actually had on board 1200 between Euwait and Bushire . The fault was not with the Captain but rather with the .Agents at Basrah, Muhammerah and Kuwait who put passengers on board against the Captain's will. (c) Merchants in-Bahrain have recently complained about the many ^bberies which take place on the coastal steamers between Bombay and Bahrain. They say bags of such articles as sugar rice etc. are frequently filled with sand or gram and often are missing altogether. (d) The I „G J 1 .S 'Patrick Stewart” recently ran down and sank a local dhow, m enquiry has been held today 6 th December and the Court has found the Commander of the 'Patrick Stewart' ft , n ot^ b 1 ame • CLIMATIC . 154.

(c) RICE JJESTI O r . The vexed question c£ the supply cf rice for Bahrain has been occupying much of my time. So scarce did this commodity became recently that I was compelled to ask the B J= H . to wire India for special sanction to expert 6000 bags for December. The price cf ij.ee is as high as Ri 4-C/- per tJsag here and poor people cannot afford t o buy at all. Shaikh Isa has made /A repeated requests that a larger quantity be granted this port, than has been allowed in the past. His request is a fair and re as cn ah le cne • It is perhaps not realised that Bahrain supplies an enormous area with rice and to a lesser extent other foodstuffs* The following are the towns and districts dependant on Bahrain. Qatif, H as s a, Hi ath , Anaiza, Bur aid a and Ne^d generally c&lt;, at ax , Debar and certain ports cn the Persian coast, not to speak of the /arge pearling fleet which annuall y works off the shores cf these Islands. In current year 1919 the total am amt cf rice allowed to bebe exported from India to Bahrain was 75,000 bags. This cWiOuni. r. ct near ly encugb ~ even 100,GGO bags will not suffice for cur requirements. I sincerely hope that for 1980, 150,000 bags will be allowed us. This is cnly a fair figure considering what a lucrative business India does with pert and Islands of Bahrain. I hope to address the D J Jl . in the Persian Gulf officially on this subject shortly..

To From The Political Officer, Bahrain The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad Sir / original, with free translation from myself, from Sir Abd el Aziz bin Abd ol Rahman al Faisal al Baud, K,C„I„E* Ruler ofNojd, to myself* The letter is dated the 6th February 1920 but was only received by me the evening of the 7th of February, after I had sent off my telegrams H*4 and H.7 dated the 6th and 7th respectively* With the letter Bin Saud sent a message to the effect that if I disapproved of the wording of the letter he would like me to correct it, and would rewrite it afresh* I returned answer that the letter was best left as it was, as H*M f s Government desired nothing better than to know what was exactly in his, Bin Saud r s mind, and appreciated a man who spoke what he thought I have the honour to be S ir * Your obedient servant, SdA H*PwP* Dickson MajorTRANSLATION* From ALd el Aziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Faisal al Saud* To Major H* R* P t Dickson, C* s Consul in Bahrain Dated 16 Jamada Awal ( 6 th February 1920) I beg remind you that we convened together yesterday, and knowing that it is possible, that you did not understand all I said, or that perhaps I did not make myself quite clear since I spoke at great lengthy I have thought fit to write you this letter and make myself quite clear in writing* Firstly with regard to Syria and Hej/az f there are intrigues on foot that will gr*viously ham us both (H.M^s Government and Bin Saud) These intrigues are emanating from both Turks and Arabs and are taking tne form of a Proclamation of Jehad* This matter I explained personally to you in conversation, also how that harm was coming to everyone from it* Secondly* With regard to our own condition with the Sharif The people of Uejd have today (now-a-days) attacked me regard ing the Sharif’s doings. What they say is as follows ’’You 0, Bin Saud, have deceived us in Religions as well as mundane matters* You say firstly that the English are helping you against your enemies and that they will defend you against all who attack you* We however have seen nothing but the contrary* The English have helped the Sharif with full hand, both in ^ arms and money, so that he has become strong and efficient in every direction* You 0 Bin Saud keep on saying that the English are ohly helping the Sharif in order that he may be enabled to fight the Turks* Now however the Turks have gone, yet we still see the/ aid being continued beyon^ all reason, in so much as they have given Syria to the Sharif as a posses- sion, while we on the other hand are prevented by your friends from touching our rightful heritage Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and other places* Thirdly* When the Sharif assailed us through our religion (preached that we were Kafirs) and attacked our land, and when God Almighty gave us the victory over him, your friends the Eno-iigh robbed us of tbe fruits of that victory*2 Fourth^cy* You da^ily tell us that the matter 'between the Sharif and yourself will he settled hy your friends and that the Sharif will he forbidden to hurt us, or trespass on our lands, also that your friends the \ m « English will guarantee that we Haj Mecca freely and openly. none Yet KH 3 C of these things have happened. If you are speaking the truth 0 Bin Saud and the English desire to act justly and are true men, they should under*- stand the matter and maintain a proper balance among us Arabs giving nei&amp;h^r land nor money where they -—' / are not deserved. We then will be satisfied. Or let them allow us Arabs to fight it out among ourselves; Let the Conquerors be your friends and let those who lose take the consequences* If you can promise us neither course there is a third alternative, let your friends separate Syria ^ from the Hejaz and let Syria be independent and stand alone, allowing the Amir of the Hejaz no say whatsoever in matters concerning her neither in her internal or external affairs. For Syria is the northern landing stage (askala) of ITejd, and if it remains in the Sharif* s hands it will oe like a smutd sword pointed at our heart. If you Oh Bin Saud,can obtain the above points for us, we shall believe that you are our well wisher and that the English are our friends. If you cannot obtain them for us, then we know you have deceived us, and we will have to decide on some course ourselves” I have desired to inform you of the abo^e, in order that you can convey the contents of this .Letter to superior authority , and get me an answer that will cause my mind to rest, also the minds of the people of Hejd. For if the business is delayed and there should arise any trouble from Hejaz or Syria however small, tfiere will le a blaze, and I would like K.Ji's Government to realize that I cannot hold myself res-3 responsible. Please inform H,M t s Government early as matter is important* ]^wait a reply* Seal of Bin Saud.ITo* 2 H o f f u f ^r?) Hassa 10th February 1920, CiTil Coirmiissioner, Baghdad, Itemo ran dum. In continuation of my telegrams H 3, H4, and H 7 dated 5th, 6 th, 7th February refpectively, I beg to : submit this memorandum which will inform you in fuller detail of all Bin Saud has had to say to me. In addition to this communication I propose submitting to you copy of my Diary kept since the day I left Bahrain, It will I hope throw additional light on the atmosphere surrounding me here, and on other matters to do with Bin Baud, Hesa and ! r ajd* Accompany ing the Diary will be a map of Hasa Oasis, also va rious sketches and panorama, A, Since February 4th I have had daily interviews with Bin Sgud, On some days we have had two interviews, Theie have always been held in private when anything has Been discussed of a Political nature. On all occasions Bin Saud has treated me with the greatest courtesy, friendship and consideration. He was encouraged to open his mind to me and keep nothing back, I have refrained from submitting this report earlier Because I desired to give Bin Saud ample opportunity of unburdening himself and getting over his first natural restraint with me, I think I have been justified in doing bo, though I realize the inconvenience the delay in receipt of this report must have given you. As tne days have passed Bin Saudts manner has become more friend ly and I think he has now unburdened himself of all he^ had in his mind, B . First and foremost I should like to mention that # t^e thinn v^hioh has struck me most in conversation with Bin Soud, has been the efficiency of Ms intelligencesystem. He appears to 'be in closest touch with Egypt, yyria, nijaz, mdia and * iraq, and there was little * &gt; - could tell him which he had not a thoroughly good knowledge of already* I gathered his agents consisted largely of the many Najdi merchants who are scattered over the near East and India* The second point that struck me was the affection of Bin Sa U( 3- for everything British, and his almost pathetic seemed trust in H.M 1 s Government* At the same time he xxkkxjkA to C. he suffering from the delusion that we did not understand HaJd matters properly, that the Sharif had him at a dis advantage hy reason of his Being in telegraphic touch ■with H,M l s Government, and that London was Being influenced to an undue extent By what Cairo reported, also that Cairo was entirely Balarsed in favour of the Sharif* Three points particularly appeared to exxxxr ramble in Bin Saud 1 s mind (1) The wifholding of his subsidy some months ago}, which showed distrust in his plighted word (his expression) (2) The heaping of rewards, honours, arms and money on the Sharif, 'Culminating in the royal gift of Syria' (again his words) (3) The failure on our part to support him when attacked By the Sharif at TurraBa, this in spite of the treaty ’ as drawn up Betv/een him and Sir P«Z,Cox on. oehalf of His Majesty’s Government 'Hot only did you English fail to afford me help when attacked By an external enemy, But you actually prevented me from securing the fruits of my victory over the enemy after God had delivered them into my Hands' (his words) The following are the points in detail which Bin Saud desired me to submit to you* He had received he said trustworthy information from Mecca to the effect that some 60 days ago the Sharif hadheld secret council and had decided to make use of the Syrian unrest to recover his popularity in the eyes of the Moslem world, and at the same time to bring about the downfall of himself Bin Baud, As a result of the meeting the Sharif had sent emissaries to Damascus with instruc tions to approach the Syrian Cum Turkish Nationalist Party and get them to proceed on the following lines, (a) A jihad movement to be started with the object of ejecting all Christians from Arab speaking countries, (b) To ptrsua.de the Moslems of Syria to .appeal in a body to Bin Saud, to lead the jihad in his position as Imam and Champion of puritan Islamism, (c) The jihad having been proclaimed, the modus operand! to be as follows. The Turco-Syrians to attack the French The Egyptians to cooperate by a rising in Egypt, The Imam with Arabia behind him to attack 1 Iraq, (d) The Sharif of Mecca to sit tight and watch events, protesting inability to control the Syrians in their intrigues with their Turkish friends, 0, Bin Baud stated the designs of the Sharif Husain were only too evident. He hoped either (a) to embroil him (Bin Baud) with the English if he joined the movement or (b) if he held aloof, that the people of $ajd, to whom the strongest appeal would be made on religious grounds by the Syrians, would turn against him and he would be discredited, D, The people of Syria/ were to be strongly supported in their jihad by the Egyptian Nationalist party which was in closest touch with Syria, NOTE, After /a certain amount of manoeuvring I got Bin Saud to admit to me on the evening of the 9th February, that he had already received a passionalbe appeal from S_yria and Egypt*4 Bin Saud stated his position was a iiiost awkward one he ‘blamed H»M ? s Government for Being the cause of the present situation and his difficulties. Bor, he ^said, in addition to the above bad news his own people had started accusing him of deceiving them. They were putting the blame of the S harif’s increasing power, and the fact that he had been given Syria, down to Bin Saud*s lack of in fluence with the English- ''England 1 ’, they said ^was supporting the Sharif out of all reason, and was conti nuing to support him, while you 0, Bin Saud tamely submit to every order your supposed friends give you. As an instance, how is it your friends failed to help you according to treaty, when the Sharif ma.de his treacherous attack on Turabah? How is it they forbad you and us to reap the fruits of victory over the invaders on that occasion? How is it your friends continual promises to the effect that the Sharif intrigues against our boundaries will cease, have come to naught? Either the English are playing with you 0 Bin S a ud, or you are lying to us: We therefore put it to you finally, if the English are your true friends get them to at once guarantee two tilings (a) That the Sharif will no longer commit hostile acts on our frontier, and that the 'status quo ' the^e, 'be definitely recognised once and for all. (*) That the Holy places be thrown open to the whole of Beg d at once, and the safety of all Hajd Pilgrims be assured* If they are unwilling to take this step then let us in God f s Hame break with the English and fight the Sharif settling the matter in our own way' BOTE, Bin Saud though putting the above supposed words into the mouths of his people, made de cii* it that he entirely agreed with the views ^expressed. In other words they they reflect his own mind in the matter. Regarding the jihad question,, and theV HlujnHlil I'll 5 gener^ly ^ Bin Saud expressed himself in the strongest terms, that the clearest and best method of counteracting the jihad movement was for us to support him, and deal first and foremost with the demands ol his people* ihe latter v/ere highly dissatisfied at the course of events in Syria and the Hija^ and were a potential danger to be reckoned with, in the event of a jihad coming off* If his ? Ulama decided that a jihad Y/as right it would take all his authority to counteract their influence* Anti-European feeling did exist and the Hijaz, Haj , and the the obvious ,1 red Herring” we should employ if we lavir^cd- to lead the thoughts of the people away from the danger* Apart from his personal reasons, he gave it as his opinion that we had made a grave mistake in our iJyricm Policy* We ought never to have withdrawn our troops* Infinitely preferable was it for Syria to have remained in British hands than to have given it over to either Faisal or the French* Vast difficulties end real dangers were before us as the result of our Policy, He advocated the creation of an ’’entirely independant Syrian state” even now. It was not too late he said, and should not be beyond our powers of diplomacy. He realized he would be accused of advocating this step from anti-Sharif feelings but he called God to witness that he v/as actuated in the intered* of peace and good will between English and Arabs, Further he supported the idea that for the future control 1 of the Arab speaking races, including Egypt a special Coucil 5 should be formed consisting of selected Englishmen only, 1 whose duty would be to decide future and current policy, Wis Committee to sit in Baghdad with a Head Office in London managed by a Secretary of State for Arab Affairs* The present policy of dividing the control between Egypt and Baghdad was fatal, and was already leading to ; Arabs believing that they had two rival cliques of Englishmen to cleo.l with. He quoted the familiar saying6 of a house divided against itself not 'being able to stand* G* Regarding his opai personal feelings and asp irations* Bin S ? ud stated he desired, before all things, peace and friendliness with the English, but bitterly H*M ? s Government for neglecting him, the 'true Sultan” and leader of the Arabs, and appointing the Amir of the :&gt;jaz t till lately eJlji 61,6 servant of Turkey, as so called ’’King” England had not played straight with him and in spite of p.z.Cox*s promise to raise him ”to the sky#” (uis words) after the war, he found he was in exactly the same, if not in poorer position nowadays* Government failed apparently completely to realize -iwtd he had stood against his people through his sense of loyalty to England* He had been over and over again urged to attack Mecca and Medina but had refused steadfastly owing to his plighted word to us* Daily and in a way unsought by him, his power as imam and leader of Islam, was increasing. This fact increased his difficulties instead of diminishing them. Prom all sides he was receiving letters and offers of support as the one true companion of Islam left in the world, Egyp t , Oman, Egypt, Oman, Yemen Trucial Coast tribes, Shammax Anizaii and even the inhabitant? of Mecca and Medina themselves were writing and He was stead ah and even the inhabitant? of Mecca and Medina s were writing and ng-aid. He was steadily refusing to answer any letters from those rulers who were in treaty with the English, NOTE. I myself saw this morning two letters from letters from those rulers who were this morning two letters from the Idrisi and Imam Yahya of Yamen to Em Saud, greeting him in affectionate terms and ashing that teachers of Akhwanism b e sent to7 0 his people on the one hand, and he would be enabled to refuse all Syrian and Egyptian offers* ITay further he was prepared to champion the English among Mohamedan peoples, and would certainly guarantee under the above conditions to keep the entire peace in Arabia* He earnest ly begged England to realize that he was a friend and admirer, She Moslem world was asking him to champion it # He desired to remain Englandts friend* Yet unless he had her unqualified support he saw himself forced to forsake her, or fall between two stools (bani jabaiain) H* As r egards Turabah and Khurmah The people of Haj d ? would never give these u&amp; He failed to see any use in negotiations, or attempts to arrange a meeting between himself and the Sharif, H e would never agree to meet th* Sharif in any case outside Hajd* He again recapitulated the reasons why Hajd would rather perisn than give up a yard of Turabah or Khurmah soil, (a) Turabah and Khurmah had always been in his, his fathers, and grandfathers hands* (b) The inhabitants themselves would die rather than come under the yoke of Mecca* (o) During the Turkish occupation of/fijaz, and the latter had a “Wall' the^e, the #ijaz province did not include these two border towns, nor were tcfles ever demanded by the Turks at anytime whatsoever, (d) The Sharif was an ex-subject of the Turks, now therefore could he claim more than they, the masters claimed (e) Hijaz itself used to be subject to Najd which latter never was nor had been subject to Turkey, and as such how was it thinkable that a late subject should be allowed to lay claim to part of Sis (Bin Sauds) ancient ancestral territories* # (f) Turabah was an important town strategically and commanded the road to Yemen and Dawasir. In the hands of the Sharif it would form an invaluable base for future operations against Najd, for this reason if for8 5 no other IIaj d could not tolerEite it in any other hands hut its own* The Ahhwan , Bin Saud had much to say regarding the movement in general. The movement he maintained was directly due to God moving the hearts of his Arabs, He himself was their ’’Lea^der” and ,, lma£a M and entirely asso« dated himself with / the Akhwans religious beliefs, W I am the Akhwan”- he kept on repeating*- ’’Our tenets con~ sist of two essential/* ' (a) Worship of God and our country” (*) ’’BZrotherhood among all true Moslems” Bin Saud said the movement had affected the Beduin in an extraordinary manner. They were filled with a x&amp;xxgx strange religious zeal, and were continually begging to have teachers sent them. He was sending tUlama to teach them as fast as he could provide them. His principal method of guiding the movement and keeping it und«r control was M City building ”. He insisted on the Beduin ■fc^iBes settling down, and building towns for themselves, in spots decided on by him. This was af^er they nad satisfied him that they had the true spirit of Religion in their hearts (Itha qaliknarid tadaiyin), Tne head shaikh of the tribe so settled, he ordered^to Riyadh and attached him to himself, VJherever he went thefe _ Shaikhs accompanied him, and were at his h4ck and call. In this way he had a fine military machine and.could by passing an order to his body guard of shaikhs mobilize s/ in a few days over SOOjOOO men. Since the Akhwan move ment started 53 new cities had been built, with numbers of inhabitants ranging from 50 00 to 30000 each. Bin Saud claimed to now control the Beduin element throughout Arabia (Badiyah) with the exception;of the Dhafis Jribe which he admitted come under Iraq, The following are the names of the new towns built by the Akhwan in the last 4 years:-10 'S’r 1 J# Regarding Fina nces^ Bin Saud stated he was very I /-— I hard up for money. He did not know which way to turn* He was keeping his people and. especially the Akhwan under control, largely by means of openhandedness^charity and presents. He would like his subsidy increased if pos sible, He knew our difficulties, but pleaded that his subsidy meant a united H^aj d and so L &gt;aw and order, which was an asset to great Britain, His people were at present under control, but he was compelled to borrow money. He hoped later on to improve things by opening 1 U P port of Jubail when he v/ould get a larger customs • revenue. He hoped then to dispense with British aid. He had not yet foundhis legs quite, he trusted H,M*s Government would continue to foster the growth of his young Government by monetary aid, HOTE, I have not yet mentioned anything about your offer of a three months advance as per your telegram Ho,119 of 25th January 1920, K, A wireless ma st and installation f or Riyadh . Bin S aud touched on this point, and trusted some time H, M*s Government would see its way to either give him a wireless installation in Riyadh or fix up a land telegraph line from Bahrain to Riyadh, All he stipulated was that the operators at Riyadh be Mo slams. He hoped also to ask H.M,Government that a Political Officer should from time to time be sent out to Riyadh , He suggested the coming summer as suitable for me to pay him a visit. In this matter I took care to be non-commital, Sd/- H,R,P,Dickson, Major, Political Agent,My dear Colonel, Hoffuf J f February 10th, 1920 # This is just a line to give you my impressions of Bin Saud, First and foremost he is in my opinion a man who wants watching most carefully. His state of mind is such that the cleverest of men could*nt say what he was really thinking about, or what course of action he would decide on. To meet, he is all that is charming and nice b ut one cannot say whether he is a Religious Fanatic or an accomplished actor. He badly wants a friend who will insist on being heard, and even talk back at him, When you first enter his mijliss room and salaams are over, Bin Saud starts a wild religious har^angue. His talk is mixed up with much Qpran quotation and cursing of the Turk and Sharif always. His talk may be all ^iyasi' for all one can tell but one goes away with the feeling that he had either got a strain of lunacy in him, or that religion has effected his mind. At times one is almost persuaded to believe thSat he is trying to lead his Akhwan into believing he is a second liohpmed or the Mahdi, Then again one wonders whether he is not trying to carry out a gigantic bluff, H e certainly in public and private makes it quite clear that he believes himself to be the Champion of Islam, and talks '‘big** in proportion. On the other hand there are occasions when he is moody and depressed and scarcely approachable. He on those occasions gives one the impression that he is carrying on /his shoulders a great weight of responsi*- bility, I cannot help thinking his worry is his Akhwan and that he feels he is riding a horse that is getting out of hand and he does not know which way it will lead him eventually. Against this Bin Saud frequently tells me he has the Akhwan entirely dm hand. Whether in public or ptivate Bin Saud*s conversa-2 3 V &gt; L (3S3) ,v y conversation consists of one rapid flow of talk. It is - most difficult to get a word in even edgeways. When one does get a look in, Bin Saud does not listen to you hut is obviously thinking of what he is going to say next, ! My opinion is that he is suffering from the lack of friends and that from excessive preaching to his followers he has become partly a monomaniac and partly a religious maniac, H e takes great delight in sitting with me for hhours and wont let a day go by without either visiting me or asking me to come and see him. Frequently he calls twice the same day and greatly handicaps my wdi’k. One cannot but admire his enormous energy.and pov/er , but at the same time his lonely state excites ones pity. He keeps no advisors or companions merely surrounding him self with his surely Akhwan Shaikhs, I am told he has greatly changed since he was in Basrah, old Badr al Rumaiyeth, though he is a much taller, broader and striking man generally. He is head and shoulders finer than any shaikh I have ever met though his followers dataki dont come up to the Muntafik, Yours sincerely, Sd/- H,R,P,Dickson, The Akhwan of whom B,S, has some 500 in his train are a surely lot who are well armed, refuse to salaam and wear a white cloth round their heads in place of the aggal. At prayer time their 'attitude is very striking , they form up in military style and with weapons at their feet He resembles in manner style and conversation pray in concert one of the party some 20 paces a head. Smoking is absolutely probidden everywhere in the streets. In private one can smoke.I&amp;r Baghdad,' the ruary 1920 9/2 To (l )The Under Secretaire' of State fo-W India, t/LOHDOl'T. S.W. X.

He left Kiyadh 7 0 days ago, travelling by land with 1500 sheep and loo camels whioh be sold at Kuwait, Whence by sea. 2he early rains j- ailed in Hajd; it is not a good sheep year. He has been in Hajd for the last three years. He is a striot Wahhabi - Mudalyin, as they say, that is one of the bin. He is now going to bamasous by the post road from Hit. He made light of the disturbed state of the desert: a man as well Known as he oan pass anywhere. I oegan by saying that we had had a good deal of news lately from Hajd and that I was glad to hear that Ibn aa'ud had established his power in the land. He replied; -you are wrong. There is no power or authority save that of Almighty God'. But short of the Supreme Authority he evidently regards Ibn da'ud with the utmost respeot and oonfidenoe* 1* As regards Ibn nashid. last summer tbn Sa'ud and ion iiashid reached complete agreement, ainoe then the dharif, oy means of agents and letters, has done his best to undermine the allianoe. Shis is well known to Ibn da'ud but it has not moved him. 17 hen ibn Hashid set out to do battle with Ibn sha'lan, the latter wrote to Ion Ba'ud and urged him to attack Hail while Ibn Hashid and all his fighting men were away. Ion Sa'ud refused categorically* As for the r Ajman* dome 3 months ago ibn da T u&amp; sent an envoy to the leading shaikhs who met him at Hafr in the 3atin» She terms he carried were that ibn da r ud would otfer them full and complete forgiveness, but that the leading shaikhs with their followers must come and live in Najd* r i?he matter was not terminated when Mansur left; all that was known was the Dhaidan ibn Hithlain*with 4 hosrses. Ion Munaikhir with 3 horses and A1 Asqah With 2 mares were returning with the envoy to Kiyadh. jt was manifest that they would not have eome still less Drought gifts unless they intended to accept the terms unconditionally* She rank and file of the 'Ajaian will probaoly remain in their old pasturages, ibn Sa’ud has therefore cleared his path of danger from »Ajman hostility a. The Ukhwan. Mansur said 'm the last two years Ibnji 3a’ud' s mind has altered and his conduct has altered with it , ,/ith the result that his position has become stronger?' I asked 'iiuoh stronger', he replied, I gathered tha. he alluded to a definite and successful attempt on ibn da'ud’s part to establish his supremacy in eastern Araoia* 2 wo months before the fight at farabah # ibn ^a^ud sent round a madhbataii to all the settled population of Uajd. m this he said that he should claim from them in future not only 'adabi (customary service) but also shar*i (religious ooedience)* Where a village had formerly given an accepted small proportion of men on a call to arms, it would now have to provide Ibn 3a*ud with every man capable of Gearing arms, while those who were too old would be called on to give an equivalent in money, only the aged who were also indigent would be exempt# He asked the villages whether they acknowledged his rights* They replied with one voice that he was the Imam and that they had no rights against him* Shis means that he has estaolished his position as a religious as well as a political leader* Mansur recited the text of this Madhbatah it was a fine and dignified declaration* While he was away at khurmah, Faisal al kuwish too the opportunity to extend his claims* she Mutair are half settled Mudaiyinin and half nomadic, the latter being divided into two groups, one turning to Kuwait, the other to ion Jaluwi in Hasa* Ibn Duwish sent orders to the Beduin groups that they were to abandon their irreligious nomadic life and oeoome settled cultivators under hisah oommand* if they refused he was prepared to use force. Sur ces entrefaits Ibn 3a r ud ret' i arned» He sent for ibn Du^wish and met him in Majlis in a garden near RiyadhtShere before all men he asked him by what right he had issued commands to the Mutair* 'Had you orders from me? What other orders do you reckon to ooey? ,T I bn Du^wish collapsed at once* admitted his error in full Majlis and was sent oaok to iirtawi with his tail oetween his legs* Ibn aa T ud then drove his voctory home* He assembled eleven leading *ulama of Najd; Mansur gave details as to five, namely r Abdullah ibn r Abdul Latif and his brother, both of Riyadh, descendants of ibn Wahhab the founder of Vahhaoiisra, Al r Anqri of S'udair, , umar ion Salim of Biiraidah and Aodullah ibn Bulaihid of Ml Rus# (phe eleven drew up a decisive document which Mansur recited textually; ’’Let it oe known that there is no difference between the mudaiyin and the non—mudaiyin; and no difference between the turban and the r aqal; and no difference between the traveller and the dweller in one place; and no difference between him who has long dwelt in one place and him who has recently built himself a house* She Imam r Abdul *Aziz ibn Aodul ^ahman ibn Sa r ud is the Imam and to him is the payment of zikat and the duty of service* 'Mtidaiyin nnH non-mudaiyin, i.e* the Akh and the ordinary Wahhabi of Hajd, or the Wahhabi and other Muslims, I think the latter is intended* Durban and r aqa 4 .; the Ukhwan have rejected the r aqal which is the customary head dress of settled Uajdis and Beduin; Ibn da f ud himself wears it* Traveller and dweller; Mansur commented 'The Ukhwan treated me (he is an , Aqaili merchant and therefore always on tne road) as an infidel'* The last phrase refers to the fact that the Ukhwan ouilt themselves new settlements and called on all Mudaiyin to come in and join them, on peril of being accounted infidels* This document, which Mansur spoke of as a tfatwah, has been circulated throughout Najd* That Ibn ba l ud shouldhave issued a i’atwah would be sufficient proof of his religious authority in Hajd, but that he should have issued it, not under his own name but over the signature of eleven of the best known 'ulama is a triumphant indication not only of his religious hold but also of his political oirouiaspeotion* Dated Baghdad, L . the 2«3r&amp; February 19Eo*i' f MINUTS* . !.

(Received 3rd February, 2 p.m.) 3^3 my telegram of 24th January, 1082. Nejd mission, which is now in Bombay, should reach Hasa about 20th February. Llntil Bin Sand has conferred with mission and has seen report of the proceedings to which reference is made in draft message to Bin Saud, it is unlikely he will feel able to answer latter, and suspicion may be aroused if we press for a reply previous to the return of mission. I therefore propose, subject to your approval, to await arrival of mission and news as to nature of communication referred to by Bin Saud in his letter of 15th January before forwarding to him the message ordered in your telegram of 24th January. Secondly. I do not think that Bin Saud will consent to proceed to Jeddah by land, and I doubt if it is expedient on general grounds to ask him to do so. He would certainly not venture there without a large personal escort, and in the present state of religious tension the result of any untoward incident might be very grave. The intention of (? journey) might, moreover, be widely misunderstood. Thirdly. Should he not consent to proceed to Jeddah by land, two courses appear possible. (1) To ask King Hussein to agree to the meeting in the neighbourhood of Taif, Ashairah or Tarabah. (2) To ask Bin Sand to visit King Hussein at Jeddah by sea, and to provide him with a naval or Royal Indian Marine vessel for the purpose. I shall be glad to know whether the latter course would receive approval of His Majesty’s Government. The naval commander East India Squadron will be in Baghdad on 10th February, and I could discuss details with him if desired. Latter course would clinch matters, and would ensure that the two parties met. Whether Bin Saud would agree to do so or not, however, is very doubtful. I ourthly. In view of above considerations, 1 recommend that, unless journev by sea is approved, no reference be made to the place of meeting in communication made to Bin Saud, and in the circumstances that relevant sentence should be revised as follows :— “ They are glad to be able to inform you that King Hussein is willing to meet you, and to endeavour to come to a friendly arrangement with you. The time and place of this meeting should be arranged direct with King Hussein, and intimated to me for the information of His Majesty’s Government.” Clear the line. Your telegram No. 1244, dated 28th January. Bin Saud. Provided it is certain that Bin Saud will remain at Hasa until Nejd Mission arrives, I approve your proposal to await Mission’s arrival before communicating message conveyed in my telegram of 24th January. I agree that it will be preferable for Bin Saud to proceed to Jeddah by sea, and you are authorised to p’/opose this to him and to make necessary arrange ments. 1 am asking Admiralty to instruct Naval Commander-in-Chief to render you all assistance in his power. You will bear in mind that His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to meeting between King Husain and Bin Saud, and that latter’s visit to Hasa affords opportunity that is not likely to recur not only of influencing him effectively in desired direction, but of ensuring that he actually sets out on the journey. My telegram of 5th February. Bin Saud. Admiralty have instructed Naval Commander-in-Chief as requested, but consider it unlikely that he can spare a ship, and suggest that Royal Indian Marine vessel might be lent by Government of India if Bin Saud cannot travel by ordinary steamer.

Effect o^rritten despatches is to lend power to telegraphic summary and to enhance impression created in my mind of the mutual incompatibility of Bin Saud and King Hussein and of great moral, political and military strength of the former. 2. I consider it certain that Bin Saud in his present temper would persist in refusal to meet King Hussein on board one of His Majesty’s ships in Hedjaz waters,though I am quite willing to make the attempt. Recent news from Syria will make him doubly determined to have no dealings with King Hussein and will make him more prone than before to misinterpret his not being anxious that he should meet the Shereef. 3.

HSJS-HSJIZ DISPUgE » HOTS BY Ivffi.PHILBY OP IvLlRCH B3rd 1920. 1,1 ^ ^ , '',U LVf ^ Yi J* ft ^ May I make 'bold uo force a little unsolicited advice on you on two masters - the proposed reduction of Ibn 3aud ! s stibsidy and the proposed meeting between him and the Sherif? As regards the subsidy I fully admit that 1.3. has no claim whatever to our financial support but I do hold very strongly that it is in our own best interests to subsidise him, if we really wish to make, good our own claim to exclusive political influence in Arabia. Ibn Saud will decline to recognise that- claim unless we give him a quid pro quo; he is willing to shape his policy as far as possible in accordance with our wishes so long ass he has something to gain thereby but if we whittle down or discontinue our subsidy he must consult his own interests regardless of our wishes and there are only two courses open to him: (l) to attack the Sherif and either pocket the profits of the Jidda customs and Mecca pilgrimage or force us to buy him out by a regular subsidy - in adopting this policy he would have his whole country solid at his back; or (2) to seek financial support elsewhere either from the French, who would find him and Ibn Rashid useful allies in their coming difficulties with Feisal, or from the Bolshevists, in the event of^their propaganda spreading beyond its present limits. Ibn Saud must have money and, as soon as he finds it idle to look to us, he must turn elsewhere or let his country go to pieces. I hope G-overnment will give this matter their most serious consideration and will at least issue orders to continue the subsidy undeminished until they have made up their minds regarding future policy.II • 3J &gt; spreads and there is anything line a general revolt against British policy in Hejaz and Mesopotamia, we may need the services of Ibn Sand and it would be foolish to alienate his sympathies now. As regards the second question, if the proposed meeting between Ibn Saud implies the latter^ readiness to reconsider his previous attitude on the boundary question I welcome it as a step in the right direction. As you remarked Ibn Saud has become more ambitious than he was two years ago and this is only natural in the circumstances. Ambition crescit eundo. Yesterday he claimed Khurma, today he claims luyaba, tomorrow it will be Taif and so on. The longer a settlement is delayed the worse the position will become and I for one view with perfect equanimity the prospect of his becoming master of all Arabia, but that is not H.M.G’s policy and if H.M.Gr* seriously wish to save Husain they should act without delay. I gathered however from you that while both parties now agree in principle to meeting each other is nervous of facing his rivals before a packed audience - instructive comment on our own divided counsels - and that the proposal is in danger of falling through on that account. That would be very regrettable and, so far as Ibn Saud is concerned, his nervousness is easily explained. He knows that I am his friend, he knows that I have supported his claim for an impartial consideration of his position and he sees that I don 1 1 cut much ice; naturally he suspects that G-overnment will try to force his hand when they get him into their clutches and is shy of coming out of his shell. Some attempt should be made to disarm his suspicions before the idea of a meeting is abandoned. I assume that the Sherif is anxious that such a meeting should take place under tne auspices or the ^~igh Commissioner and that Government also wisn Ghat - I peisdinal-ty am strongly of opinion that it should oe so; if that is the caseAm „ . ' 31 ^ case and the only outstanding difficulty is to induce Ibn Saud to agree, I volunteer and guarantee to bring him to a meeting at any place desired by H.M.Gr. outside the limits of the Hejaz - e.g* Cairo, Aden, Port Sudan, Bombay, Jerusalem or anywhere else. I would only stipulate (l) that His subsidy be not reduced in the meanwhile and ( 2 ) that I should accompany him until he is safely bach in his own territories. If such a plan were adopted I see no reason why a compromise should not be arrived at such as the one you tentatively suggested yesterday - furaba to the Sheri^and IQiurma to I.S. I do hope you will not turn a deaf ear to my advice on these two points.

I have, however, intimated to Major Dickson, in a separate communication, that, should Bin Sand definitely negative idea of visiting King Hussein by sea at Jeddah, he should sound him as to whether he would be willing to meet latter at some othei place, such as Cairo or Aden, vide Foreign Office letter dated 1st Decembei, to C olonel ^ C. (corrupt group) Wilson. . . . ■ As u some other place ” was referred to by Secretary of State loi 1 oieign Allans in his conversation of 26th November, with Najd mission, this extension or proposal seems unobjectionable and will, 1 hope, be approved. As regards Bin Sand’s requests, I find it most difficult to make'recommenda tions. 1 regard Bin Sand as by far the strongest man in Arabia at pie;:ent, and least likely to lose his influence by reason of his attitude towards ourselves. 1 regard Jus goodwill as now even more important to us than that of King Hussein. Unlike attei, he can and will maintain his position and authority, whether or not we assist, and is thus not liable to the loss of prestige which King Hussein has suffered by mere tact of his dependence on us. . . , 01Q The only solution l can see is that suggested in my telegram of i th August iJL8 No. 6491, viz., that Bin Sand be informed in writing that Article - of the IreaU ot 26th December 1915, applies equally to aggression by King Hussern. If we can o-ive Bin Sand this undertaking and simultaneously induce him to meet King Hussein, I have hopes of a satisfactory settlement between the two parties, but I do not think one will be effective without the other, and 1 earnestly commend this proposal to the consideration cf His Majesty s Government. I submit it involves but little extension of the formula approved m India Office telegram of 15th August 1918, in reply to my above-quoted telegram. z-'Vi(P 1202) From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 12th February 1920.

I have transmitted yoor telegram of 25th January to Major Dickson, with following comments :— “ Please add 1 have been authorised by His Majesty’s Government to propose :— He should proceed to Jeddah by sea in one of His Majesty’s ships, and Admiralty have ^instructed His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Ohief, who arrives at Baghdad on 5th February, to render all the assistance in bis power in this connection. “ He can be accompanied by any reasonable number of retainers up to ten, and I would propose you would go with him yourself. “ The sea is generall} 7 very calm at this season of the year. “ You will bear in mind, when pressing this solution upon him, that His Majesty s Government attach, great importance to the meeting between King Hussein and Bin Sand, and that latter’s visit to Hasa affords an opportunity that is not likely to recur, not only of influencing him effective!} 7 , but of ensuring that he actually sets out on the journey. “ If Bin Sand delinitely negatives the idea of meeting Sherel at Jeddah, please sound him (? unofficially) as to whether he would agree to a meeting with Sheref at Aden or Cairo.

(Received 13th, 7 p.m.) Priority A. (R.) 1867. My immediately preceding telegram. Your telegram dated 6th February. Bin Sand. Nejd Mission arrived at Bahrein 7th February. Political Agent, Bahrein, reached Hasa 1st February. Bin Sand arrived 4th February and after exchange of official visits had confidential interview with Political Agent on 5th February with following result. (1) He claimed very earnestly and with some warmth that we were making his position most difficult by lack of support. (2) He complained that our apparent support of claims of King Hussain to Syria had aroused much resentment in Nejd. (3) With regard to proposed meeting with Shereef, Bin Sand anticipated reference by Political Agent to question by announcing that he had heard from Mecca that efforts were being made to arrange such a meeting and that for various practical and other reasons it was quite impossible that meeting should take place anywhere in Hedjaz territory. (4) It appears, as I rather expected, that chief reason for his visit to Hasa is question of possible jihad directed against us from Syria. On this subject Bin Sand made following statement. He had received information from Mecca that Shereef had decided to utilise Syria jihad movement in order to reinstate himself in eyes of Moslem world, and at the same time to discredit Bin Sand. Shereef had sent emissary to Syria with instructions as follows. Firstly, that jihad should be proclaimed in Syria in first place ; in the event of the people of Syria being reluctant to act, aid of Turks should be invoked. Secondly, invitation should be sent from Syria to Bin Sand to lead jihad movement in his capacity as avowed champion of Islam. Thirdly, on the declaration of jihad, action to be directed in first place against French in Syria and then against Mesopotamia ; it was hoped that Bin Sand would co-operate against Mesopotamia. Bin Saud said that it was obvious that Shereef (who would take no overt part in above movement until it was definitely successful) anticipated that Bin Saud would be placed by above manoeuvre on horns of a dilemma, viz. : — If he joined movement he would thereby alienate British support. If he held aloof, the people of Nejd, to whom strong appeal would be made, would turn against him. Bin Saud earnestly urged as vital necessity that following action be taken at once to restore confidence and to prove to people of Nejd that he had not trusted Great Britain in vain. Firstly, His Majesty’s Government to guarantee at once in writing the maintenance of existing status quo on frontier. Secondly, His Majesty’s Government to guarantee at once in writing that Sheree,f would refrain from aggressive policy. Thirdly, Mecca and Medina pilgrimage to be opened to people of Nejd, and safety of Nejd pilgrims whilst in Hedjaz to be assured. Bin Saud expressed himself as positive, and undertook to guarantee that if His Majesty’s Government could see their way to give above undertakings, peace of Arabia, so far as he was concerned, was assured, and neither incitements to jihad nor Syrian intrigues would have slightest effect on his people. He has up to date not referred to question of money or arms. Above is purport of message from Hofuf, dated 6th February, received Jlth February.

I have had no previous intimation of charges brought forward hy Bin Baud* People of Syria have little sympathy with hussein and relations between him and Feisal are at present rather strained so it is unlikely that iving is at the head of any Jehad movement in Syria. At the same time he is undoubtedly on trial in the eyes of many hrab ho si e ms and when partition of Syria is announced he will probably feel himself bound, as originator of negotiations with us, to repudiate it and identify himself with Syrian Nationalists.

At the same time his previous loyalty inclines me to believe that he will take no other action unless forced by circumstances and that he still hopes for a solution which will render possible maintenance of his friendship with Great Britain.

Attitude of both King and Bin Baud shows that a meeting between them is unlikely to have any good results unless It takes place in suitable surroundings and under the auspices of a high official. To suggest that they should meet at Khurma or Turaba where a British official would be at a disadvantage and where feeling is already red hot appears to be inviting failure. In any case I feel sure that King would refuse to meet Bin Baud in Khurma which he regards as his own. King would probably raise (?same) objections to a meeting at Baghdad or Bombay as Bin Baud has to Cairo. Best solution appears to lie in removing them both from their environment and subjecting them to new influences and ideas. I therefore suggest they should meet in London. King has already been invited and Bin Baud could hardly refuse invitation of His Majesty's Government. Meeting R. 11.25.a,m.

The pilgrimage cannot be carried out without considerable danger of distur bances till a settlement is arrived at* If Bin Baud should still decline to meet the King at Jeddah or elsewhere ^ after being info lined as above, you snouid tell him that His Majesty's Government is greatly surprised to hear of his reluctance to undertake a stop which they believe that he himself considered expedient 5 Tney considered 'chat, whatever objections the King might put forward, they now expect none from Bin Baud, who had often expressed himself as prepared to accept His Majesty's Government's advice on one subject of his differences with the King* The suggosoion was madetiade t .0 King Hussein first for this reason, and His Majesty's Government hope that Bin Said will accept -oheir invitation, now that the King has done so. thus showing himself no less dis posed to accept their advice than he lias been in the past,, Should Bin Sand still refuse after receiving this message you should sound him as to his wilxingness, if King Hussein agrees, to meet the latter on hoard one of His Majesty's ships at Jeddah port.

He can be accompanied by any reasonable number of retainers up to ten and I would propose you would go with him yourself. The sea is generally very calm at this season of the year. You will bear in mind, when pressing this solution upon him, that His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to the meeting between King Hussein and Bin Saud. and that latter’s visit to Hasa affords an opportunity that is not likely to rwswrrw recur not only of influencing him effectively, but of ensuring that he actually sets out on the journey. If Bin Saud definitely negatives the idea of meeting Sheref at Jeddah, please sound him (? unofficially) as to whether he would agree to a meeting with Sheref at Aden or Cairo. You should however, do your best to induce him to accept meeting at Jeddah. As regards requests contained in your telegram of February 5th, please inform Bin Saud that they nave been transmitted to His Majesty’s Sovernment for their favourable consideration. If he meets King Hussein, I feel sure that many difficulties 3 D will disappear.

As w some other place' was referred to by Secretary of State tor Foreign Affairs in ms conversation of November 26th, with Nail mission, tms extension of proposal seems unobjectionable and will, I hope, be approved. As regards Bin Baud’s (? requests). I find it most difficult to make recommendations. I regard Bin Saud as by far the strong- esw man in Araoia at present and least likely to lose his influence by reason of his attitude towards ourselves. I regard his irood- will as now even more important to us than that of King Hussein. t xi he can and will maintain his position and authority wnewher or not we assist, and is thus not liable to the loss of prestige wmch King Hussein has suffered by mere fact of his dependence on us. ^ The only solution I can see is that suggested in mytelegram of August? th, 1918, No.60491i viz that Bin Saud be informed in writing that Article 2 of the Treaty of December 26th, 1915 applies equally to aggression by King Hussein. , . we can give Bin Saud this undertaking and simultaneously induce him to meet King Hussein, I have hopes of a satisfactory settlement betweenthe two parties, (? but I) do not think one will be effective without the other, and I earnestly commend this proposal to the consideration of His Majesty’s Government.

Political Agent, Bahrein,-reached Hasa February 1st. Bin Saud arrived February 4th and c p^#r^exchange of official visits had (? confidentialj interview\Political Agent on February 5th with following result. One. He claimed very earnestly and with some warmth that we were making his position*most difficult by lack of support. Two. He complained (? that our) apparent support of claims of King Hussein to syria had aroused much resentment in Nejd. 3. With regard to proposed meeting with Shereef, Bin Saud &gt; anticipated reference by Political Agent to question by announcing that he had heard from Mecca that efforts were being made to arrange such a meeting and that for various practical and other reasons, it was quite impossible that meeting should take place anywhere in Hedjaz territory. 4. It appears, as I rather expected, that Chief reason for his visit to Hasa is question of possible jihad directed against us from Syria. On this subject Bin Saud made following statement. He had received information from Mecca that Shereef had decided to utilize Syria jihad movement in order to reinstate^himself in eyes of Moslem world, and at the same time to discredit Bin Saud. Snereef had sent emissary to 0 Syria with instructions as follows. Firstly, that jihad should be proclaimed in Syria in first place* in the event of the people or Syria being reluctant to act, aid of Turks should be involved. Secondly, invitation should be sent from Syria to Bin Saud to lead jihad movement in his capacity as avowed champion of Islam. Thirdly. On the declaration of jihad, action to be directed in first place against French in Syria and then against Mesopotamia; it was hoped that Bin Saud would co-operate against Mesopotamia. Bin Saud said that it was obvious that Shereef (who would take no overt part in above movement until it was definitely successful) anticipated that Bin Saud would be placed by above manoeuvre on horns of a dilemma viz:- If he joined movement he would thereby alienate British support. IfIf he held aloof, the people of Nejd, to whom strong appeal would be made, would turn against him* ^ Bin Baud earnestly urged as vital necessity that following action be waken at once to restore confidence and to prove to people of Nejd that he had not trusted Great Britain in vain* Firstly. His Majesty’s Government to guarantee at once in wriving tae maintenance of existing status qup on frontier* Secondly, His Majesty’s Government to guarantee at once in wriuing tnat Shereei would refrain from aggressive policy* tt Mecca and Medina pilgrimage to be opened to oeople of Nejd and safety of Nejd pilgrims whifst in Hedjax to be' ' assure d* Bin Baud expressed himself as positive and undertook to guaranuee tnat if His Majesty's Government could see their way to give above undertakings, peace of Arabia so far as he was concerned was assured, and neither incitements to jihad nor Syrian intrigues would have slightest effect on his people. He has up to date not referred to question of money or arms. Above is purport of message from Hofuf dated February 6th received February 11th.

The rights and wrongs o« the Base have been freely discussed and I propose only to - observe here that (10 The Governor and Kadi of Khurma were appointed By King Husein in the past and the trouble started when the • • i +V!*™ for reasons it is unnecessary to enter King dismissed them lor leasuii- into here* (2) That the whole affair has been most woefully mismanaged politically and strategically by King Husein and Emir Abdullah neither of them showed the rudest grasp of the element of statesmanship,strategy or tactics. (3 ) That Ibn Saud is very elated over his success and , ,t.-, it drive the Armies has caused it to be rumoured that he will and people of the Hejaz into Jedaah. (4) That the inactivity of the King after his defea ( in accordance with our orders) and our delay in arranging •on fe-neatly the King’s fault) is having a Boundary commission (great j • , cm-mrorters in the districts a ver y bad effect on the King’s supporters of Ehurma and Tarabah* (5) T hat the -Akhwan’- or adherents of Ibn Saud are ^ + aTT ori 7 ins the district while Ibn undoubtedly raiding and terronzi g t ... Tar abah is collecting ’Zikat’ from all and gaud’s agent at Taxacau su odry,m4 i- ^ , 0 , rl= , , 6) T.if 1. fr “ W j ■irxo’ pnd is at the mercy of a Of open country and good going,- sudden raid in force by the ’’Akhwan”. f As regard6 the last point the Hejaz W. oi , , , of its mountains to defend by reason oi ioo a very easy oountiyas tiie Turks found when operating against the and passes Bedouin,hut the possession of Khurma,and Tarahah by Ibn Baud makes an unnatural boundary and presents a continual dagger thrust at Taif. Moreover the danger of Wahhabisn is in my opinion a sufficient argument for a settlement of the whole case in favour of the King. It may be of interest to note here that I was informed that at the battle of Tarabah 35 of Abdullah's slaves died fighting at the door of and round his tent while Abdullah - helped by Sherif Shakr slashed a hole in the back of the tent jumped on his horse and fled. 57 Officers ( ex-Turkish Army Officers) of the Hashimite Government were killed in their night attire. The Commander of Ibn Baud's forces has further enraged Sherif Abdullah by giving out before the battle that the ’’Shwaif” was to be captured. In Arabic diminutives are g£% often used as 'Waleyd' ( little boy instead of 'waled' (boy), the word Shwaif means little Sherif and Abdullah is furious at the insult. TKE POSIT! ON Og SAIH ALI 8 c ABDULLAH . I have pointed out to the King that the Emir Ali should have been at his post at Medina during the pilgrimage* There were many complainfcfe of attacks and looting of pilgrims bv the tribes on the Yenbo - Medina route. Ali was doing nothing at Taif except listening to a few disputes and petitions which were not his concern. The Emir Abdullah confided to me that he was practi cally pensioned off, the King took control of all his work and he was Minister for foreign affairs in name only. He was very depressed about it and held forth at length on the - vanities and futilities of the world. IHFOKJATI OH FRO M M ECCA . As regards the lack of information from Mecca,our Agent there is not of much use and the King tells ; aisuru Pasha very little of his foreign intrigues. I am trying tomake some tetter organization in this respect, The King's intrigues with the Asir.and iemen i-ave of course teen well known as well as his correspondence with Itn pashid. At present the Emir All and Itn Rashid are on most affectionate terms corresponding frequently, he letter uncle lives with Ali as he is proscribed from Hail owing to being too quick with his gun on two occasions against members of the royal family. It is reported that many dhows sent by C'eddah - .erchants to buy coffee from Yemen have been raided and looteo by the Ashraf of Zaur Hassan at lith. It is also reported that the Imam of Yemen has sent a message to the King asking if it is imaginable that there can be two imams and two Caliphs on one pulpit. j£any Persian pilgrims are delayed at Medina, and others have been looted by tribes on the road Medina-Yenbo and iledina- Jeddah. The tribes say they are only getting their back pay from the King Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. Above extract for your information please.

(1) Bin Saud to be informed in writing that Article 2 of Treaty o 26th December 1915 applies equally to aggression by King Hussein, and that a special commission will be sent by His Majesty’s Government as soon as conditions admit, to determine boundaries of territorial arrangement referred to in Article 1 of Treaty, and to conclude further agreement referred to in Article 7. Meanwhile, he must abstain from pressing his claims at Khorma, and should do his best to check the anarchic activities of Akhwan agents. (2) and (3). Philby undertakings ma}?- be confirmed. Operations against I bn Rashid appears to be only channel into which Bin Sand’s interests and aspirations can now be diverted, which will not bring him into conflict with King Hussein. I anticipate little result from these operations, the successful outcome of which would probably prove embarrassing to King Hussein, but for reasons given above I recommend that I be authorised to place liberal funds at Philby’s disposal for prosecution of campaign against Ibn Rashid, together with a further supply of 1,000 rifles and 150,000 rounds of ammunition.

Masabilla to be given friendly elements only on monthly ration system on basis of actual numbers present to prevent leakage to unfriendly elements. “3. So long as blockade of Koweit remains in hands of Ibn Subah declines all responsibility for leakage to enemy, and suggests either that blockade be resumed by British or all goods for Najd be landed at Bahrein or Hasa ports. In either case he accepts full responsibility. “ 4. That above guarantees being given on our part and hostilities against Ibn Rashid begun on his, we will not let him down by with holding sinews of war as necessary. This means money. “Having carefully considered this document, came to following con clusions t— “ (1) Further incursions of Sherif or Ajman ‘will' certainly lead to widespread disturbance, and must be stopped at all costs. “ (2) Maintenance of effective blockade h entire!} 7 in our own interests and methods suggested were only possible alternatives. “ (3) Above all urgently necessary involve Ibn Sand in hostilities with Ibn Rashid without delay partly to keep his mind from preying on other grievances and chiefly to obviate all possibility of his combining with Ibn Rashid to attack Sherif. Latter contingency by no means impossible if we leave him in lurch by refusing to redress grievances and would be extremely popular move among people. “In these circumstances, and in view unmistakable evidences .of increasing estrangement of Ibn Saud, and urgency of obliterating unfavourable impression caused by recent events, have taken responsibility of giving written undertaking in following terms, viz. :— “ (11 We guarantee him immunity from further attack by Sherif or Ajman and Shammar elements under our protection and to refuse protection and mnsabilla to hostile elements. “ (2) We will rectify blockade arrangements in some manner acceptable to him, or if unable to do so, will not hold him responsible for leakage of supplies. “(3) We will see that his material resources do not suffer by reason of any hostilities undertaken by him on our behalf. “But I have explicitly stated above undertaking is conditional on his fulfilling his promise to undertake hostilities at once, and on his setting out from Riyadh within ten days from to-day. “ This on his part he undertakes to do. “ I have added that if Government are unwilling or unable to endorse my guarantees or act on them shall not expect him to fulfil his pait of bargain. Matter now at critical stage, and everything depends on Government’s decision on this and previous telegiams. liust m} guarantees will be favourably considered and effectively endorsed without delay. Also that screw may be put upon Dhari and Ajman. As regards money, in view of Turks’ reported generous treatment of Ibn Rashid, and possibility of increased activity by him, request question of placing liberal funds at‘my disposal be considered if really vigorous campaign be desired. Refrain from making more detailed proposals in this respect as you already have my considered opinions.

Your Bordshi]- , e most o&gt;e lout, humble servant, i a y» -His Majesty’s GoTerament have recently discussed in London the vfh.olo question of the relations between Your liajesty and Ibn Saud and are very anxious that the differences ^©twoon you should be settled. His Majesty*© Government ar© of opinion that Your hjesty has a strong ease - so strong indeed does it appear to be that they oarmot understand why the matter should not be capable of easy adjustment. If it is the case, as Your ajesty eontends , t'iat your ownership of KHUHMA and T/ai/SAB is incontestable, does not appear to b© any valid objection to your producing the proofs which would convince any impartial person at 090 e‘ of the justice of your claims. Your Majesty should realise that there cannot at present be any question of the public demarcation of the boundary by a British Commission. It is only suggested and strongly urged by His Majesty's Government that Your ajesty should agree to' meet IBM SAUD personally with the object of arriving at an agree ment on all points at issue between you. His pajcsty's Government will readily arrange for the meeting to tale place at JEI-MH, CAIKO or 'M.'iU. His Majesty's Government would point ouT tTuvt their own fnt©rests and those of Your l'ajesty are, in fact, the same, YI to avoid such a calamity as further strife and by agreement between Your Majesty and IBB SAUD to bring about a condition of peace and unity in the Arabian Peninsula. IBL SAUD, for his part, has also deanded from Hi© Majesty's Government a definite recognition of his various plans, but has boon told that His Majesty's Government must do cl ire to discuss x&amp;tk them until he lias made a real effort to come to on agreement without their intervention. It is believed that IBB SAUD will be quite ready to com© to Jeddah and have a friendly conversation with Your Majesty on your territory, or elsewhere as may be desired* His Majesty's Government are hopeful that by those su:goation 3 they may have once more testified their sincere regard for Your Majesty and their recognition of the great services which Your Majesty has rendered to the Allied Cause during the war. They taice this opportunity of ugain assuring Your ajesty of their entire faith and trust in Your Majesty’© good intentions and in four a jesty'a true friendship and loyalty to Great Britain. It is essential that the risk of hostilities between Your Majesty and IBM SAUD should be entirely removed. I have been instructed to inform Your Majesty that as soon as this has been done and when it is certain that trouble will not break out in Your Majesty's absence, nothing would give His -Majesty's Government greater pleasure that to receive Your Majesty in London and discuss the many interests whieh Your Mi jo sty and Groat Britain have in common.A Copy* Ko* 1^* ' (1766154 .S../44) ( \ ^ FOREIGN OmCI February 12th # 1920.

Sir, With reference to your letter P.902 of the 5th February relative to the journey of Bin Saud, Emir of Nejd from Hasa to Jeddah by sea, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you,, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that the Commander in Chief, East Indies, has been asked to render the Civil Commissioner such assistance as may be in his power in arranging for the transport by sea ofnBin Saud. 2,— It is, however, considered unlikely that one of H.M.Ships will be available for this service. In this event, and if Bin Saud cannot travel by ordinary steamer. My Lords would suggest that the Secretary of State should provide one of the vessels of the Royal Indian Marine for his passage. I am, Sir, Your obedient Secant, X 10 ' 'O •* Oon for Secretary.x P Y C F T r*. t? ^ From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. Dated 23th January, 1920. (received 3rd February, 2 p.m.) 1244. Firstly. Your telegram January 24th received 26th crossed my telegram of January 24th, 1082. Nejd mission, rhich is now in Bombay, should reach Has a about February 20 th. Until Bin Saud ha-s conferred with mission and has seen report of the proceedings to which reference is made in draft message to Bin Baud, it is unlikely he will feel able to answer latter, and suspicion may be aroused if we press for a reply previous to the return of mission. I therefore propose, subject to your approval z to await arrival of mission and news as to nature of communication referred to by Bin Saud in his letter of January 15th. before forwarding to him the message ordered in your tele pram of January 24th. Secondly. I do not think that Bin Saud # will consent to proceed to Jeddah by land and I doubt if it is expedient on general grounds to sk him to do so. He would certainly not venture there without a large personal escort and in the present state of religious tension the result of any untoward incident might be very grave. The intention of I ? journey) might, moreover, be widely misunderstood. Thirdly, Should he not consent to proceed to Jeddah by land, two courses appear possible. One. To ask King Hussein to agree to the meeting in the neighbourhood of Tail dshairah or Tarabah, 2. To ask Bin Saud to visit King Hussein at Jeddah by sea and to -provide him with a naval or Royal Indian Marine vessel for the purpose. I shall be glad to know whether the latter course would receive approval of His Majesty's Government. The naval Commander East India Squadron will be in Baghdad ebruary 10th and I could discuss details with him if on i* desired. Latter course woul d clinch matters and would ensure that the two parties met. whether Bin Saud would agree to do so or not (? however) is very doubtful. Fourth]v. In view of above considerations, I recommend that, unless, imimav bv sea. is anoroved. no reference be made.to the pTace &lt; circum follows.

To my communication on the subject he now replies under date January 6th to the following effect. 'He cannot disbelieve statement of British Officer, but deeply distrusts Sharif. His Majesty’s Government should not forget his repeated warnings of last year regarding latter’s hostile intentions and acts which culminated in the treacherous attack on Tarabah. Then, as now, his warnings were denied or made little of by British Agent, Jeddah. He again reiterates his earnest desire for peace and disclaims responsibility should trouble arise'.

Abdullah painted a moving picture of the inhabitants of Taif being unable to go outside the city for fear of / &amp; /V being raided or seized by Ibn Baud’s people. He complained bitterly, also, of the :iamurs of Tarabah and Khurma (especially the former) collecting 'Zikat' from the Arabs of the Hedjaz. There may be some thing in the latter complaint but I do not think the former is more than a little camouflage. The King wrote saying that Taifian Arabs were being robbed and 'Zikat 1 * being collected from them by Ibn Saud, on looking up/ to the Arabic letter I found it was nicely worded.it might have been the Arabs of Taif or Arabs originally of Taif. I suspected it was the latter and wrote to the King asking for the exact spot where these people of Taif were living. The King replied -Hever mind about your question, keep to the main point and that is - Ibn Sa-ud is a bad man and is threatening me!!' The Arabs above mentioned were of course living in Kejd although doubtless of Taif origin. Abdullah means to have another fight with Ibn Baud. I pointed out clearly that with his present troops, despite the advantage of his renowned leadership, he would be committing suicide by attacking Ibn Saud. HeA: 20th Oct• 1919 5172/881.

An influential Arab Shaikh states that he hears on good authority that letters, believed from Ibn Sa-ud, have been received by certain Shaikhs on the H.E. Coast of the Red Sea,irarn£g them to be ready rf ‘ o developments - among these shaikhs are shammed Abu Rifaia of Dhiba and Ibrahim Abu Gad. The latter is said to have torn up the letter and beaten the messenger.I arrived in Paris at nearly mid-nigbt of the ie/20tb.Dec and received a rather gloomy account of the;state of affaire with' the Mission* J g I am glad to re^port that matters turned‘out better thin I was P l J led to supose and that for the remainder ©T their in Paris they continued,at any rate outwardly in a happy frame of mind and were continually laughing and Joking. The arrangements made for their comfort and amusement by Mr. Conway Davis worked well and the fact that they all repeatedly stated that they wished that they could prolongs their visit was I think sufficient testimonial as to their satisfaction. I have no doubt that Mr.Phllby has already submitted his report to you and hejis of course in a far better position to give a clear idea of their mental attitude and the effect their visit is likely to have on the political situation,than myself. Perhaps however it will not come amiss if I as an Independent observer,though It must be admitted for a very limited period, also give you the impressions my connection with the Mission made upon my mind. I will endeavour therefore to give the Gist of our conversations together. It was not long before Ahmad bln Thunlyan broached the subject of the Khursia Thuraba Impasse. At great length he gave me the history of both places commencing from a period about one hundred and twenty years previous to the present trouble to prove to his own satisfaction,the claims of Bin Saud to these two localities. I asked him when he had finished to listen to me and to forget for awhile his own view-point and to look on the question through the eyes of the British Government. I first pointed out that every question had two sides and that he had to remember that H.M.G. had to consider both aspects. I emphasised the points of the reply given to them by Lord Curzon and added the following. That having 4*** recently bean freed from the Turks Arabia was mw given an opportunity of advancement and unity under the benevelont help of Great Britain denied to them tor centuries. Ithat aucn disensions were therefore not only harmful in the greatest degree to their own interests but would endanger the friendship at present existing between Bin Baud and Great Britain and that in everybody's interests it was their clear duty and to their own advantage to seek every settlement. means possible to bring about a Ahmad replied that he fully realised the position of H.M.G, and that the question was a most difficult one repeating the phrase ' extremely difficult » several times. Fuif^ter he did notthink co-operation between the various rulers of Arabia possible. i replied that if that was his attitude and the attitude of others it certainly was not possible and was in fact impossible,and that no government and no country could exist or prosper under pre** -coneelved prejudices of that nature. That as a statesman it was his duty to work towards a settlement and to seek every means to bring it about. Three days later when Abdulla made the same remakk Ahmad at once replied ’ You are a foolish man to say that,we are only men and all we can say at present is that we cannot see the solution but God will show thw way ” Ahmad s attitude in general towards the reply given to |i them by the Foreign Secretary was as follows. | Firstly that if the Sherif persisted in his attacks on Kurma and i Thuraba Bin saud would accept the challenge. Secondly that if the Pilgrim road was not opened in time for the HaJ, in about six months,tha Ikhwan would fight their way to Mecca and Jedda and would not stop there. Thirdly that they were ready for any solution consistent with their honour,by arbitration,by mutual agreement with the Sherif in persiL: or any other means. I would like to mention here another possible solution which may- may or may not have already received consideration, that the stretcij of country in dispute should be proclaimed Independent. Ahmad speaking on his own behalf stated that he considered that this might be a possible solution which might be accepted by Bin Saud,l/'V'- Ahmad asked me to translate the Note on their Interview at the &gt; v* -t Foreign Office and I found that he had remembered the whole inter- -view practically word for word, I also spoke very plainly to him about the militant nature of the Ikhwan movement and told him that from my own personal knowlege this accounted for general hostility* That I was constantly Informed from various quarters that the Ikhwan were constantly forcing conversions under penalty of death He became rather excited and said w It is untrue absolutely ^untrue such Is not&gt; the object of our religion” I then asked ,lf such were indeed the case ,lf they were prepared | to embody the undertaking that no such forced conversions would be indulged In,In any future agreements they might wish to make. He replied ” certainly we are prepared to, 1 * We are always being misrepresented and our alms are not understood M \0n another occasion he stated that in the treaty between Bln Baud and Great Britain the latter promised protection against outside agression, I replied that I had not seen the treaty in question and was entirely Ignorant of its contents but that I felt certain that no such protection was promised in a case like the present where the quarrel was between two Arab rulers both of whom were friends of the British Government. He said ' No’ the meaning Is clear ,,,, protection from attack from whatsoever quarter ' I again and again impressed upon him bis duty to look on the situation from a wide aspect and not only from a local standpoint and insular narrow mindedness. Without being over optimistic I thought,especially by his fare- -well remarks to me,that this wider view-point had taken a place In his mental aspect of the situation. ( December 25th.) on returning to our Hotel at 9.30 p.ra, we were Shown a card of the Emir Feisal,left by two of bis Staff. The Mission showed the greatest excitement at this un-oxpected courtesy I went therefore with Ahmad to his private room and told him that the call must be returned. He refused absolutely to let Sheikh Feisal go in person sayingthat when they arrived In England the Emir waa alr-ady there that he was aware of their arrival but neither called himself nor even sent a message of welcome,that had he done so they would have received him with great pleasure and would have returned the visit with equal courtesy. That likewise they had been ten days in Paris and that he had deferredthis well understood duty until the eve of their departure The Emir's representatives left no address and I visited all the principal Hotels in Paris without being able to find out where he was,finally I met 3rlg-gen Haddad Pasha towards 11,0 in the evening and asked him if he thought it possible that the Emir might be Induced to call upon Sheikh Feisal. He expressed the view that the Emir was the elder and held an important position that such being the case that the duty of the first call should evolve upon the younger man. That in his opinion it might have a very beneficial effect if the meeting could be brought about,and that he himself was prepared to escort Sheikh Feisal to the Emir, I then returned to Ahmad and pointed out t?oat such a meeting might materially assist towards a meeting of the principals and in consequence be a considerable help towards a settlement. That the first advance had been made by the Emir who obviously meant it as a friendly act. Also that in my opinion such a friendly meeting would be looked * 0- upon very favourably by the B.G-, He however maintained his former attitude and added that he could not take the responsibility. That it was a question firstly of honour and secondly oifi well recognised etiquette and that the duty clearly lay with the Emir who was the first comer and was well aware of Arab custom. He agreed to accompany me to return the call the following day I therefore left him on that assurance. The next morning I suggested to Gen. Haddad Pasha that as a way out of the difficulty I should personally ask both parties to a private luncheon and asked him If he wa$ willing that I should ask the Mission whether they would come as my own personal guestsHe however asked me not to do so until! the call had been made, I therefore acceded to his wishes and went to fetch Ahmad and X# Abdulla,! found the latter un~prepared to go . \ He said he would not go as he hated the Emir and that they were Ud eneraje=* I pointed out to him that he had not come to Europe for his own advantage but to serve the interests of Bin Saud and that it was therefore not a question of his own personal likes or dls 1 *- llkes but his duty to his Chief, He at once gave way and accompanied us. ^ We were most excellently received by the Emir and no possible complaint either from an Arab or European point of view could be made as to the etiquette and friendliness of our reception. The conversation was of a purely general character and as far as I could Judge was harmeless except for a rather tactless question by the Emir as to the use of tobacco by the Ikhwan, With regards to this Ahmad later said to me ” There you are,you see he is absolutely ignorant of us and our religion,ho\^w can he be considered a Diplomat since he is so ignorant as to what we are • During their conversation Gen.Haddad Pasha and myself discussed the suggest-on of independently asking both parties to lunch,he wished to ask them then and there I however requested him not to do so until I had sounded Ahmad as I was most anxious that a flat refusal and therefore an Insult should not be made to the Emir’s face. General Haddad Pasha agreed and we returned to our seats. I noticed then a certain strain both in attitude and conversation and so concluded the interview. On our return I asked Ahmad if he would accept the proposed solut ion but he very politely refused repeating his former arguments. I therefore did not press the matter deeming that an interview brought about under pressure and in their then frame of mind would only be harmful. It Is to be regretted that this incident occurred only a few hours before our departure otherwise a happier result might have been hoped for. To sum up my impressions I should say that they were undoubtedly very disappolnten at the result of their Mission.X was impressed with the earnestnes, of their conviction that If the Sherif did not change hla attitude a conflict between toe two fst*) ZzijCr parties was In- ©vita Die. That they would seek and welcome any possible way out of the _f~\ difficulty consistent with their honour. That they felt tbet their attitude and alms were not clearly unu- -eretood and that they would welcome any further Inquiry Into the merits of their case. That they had been greatly Impressed by England and the English and admired both genuinely greatly. Ahmads last words to me were that he would do his utmost to seek an amicable settlement.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100032483990.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/391/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100032483990.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/391/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 2182/1913 Pt 11 'Arabia: relations with BIN SAUD Hedjaz-Nejd Dispute'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1919/1920</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-09T18:10:29</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (336 folios)</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Part 11 concerns British policy regarding the dispute between Bin Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd, also referred to in the correspondence as Ibn Saud] and King Hussein of Hejaz [Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī, King of Hejaz] over Khurma and Tarabah [Turabah]. Much of the correspondence documents the efforts of the British to persuade the two leaders to agree to meet. It is initially proposed that the two should meet at Jeddah; however, it is reported by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, that Bin Saud refuses to meet King Hussein at Jeddah, Aden, or Cairo, and suggests a meeting at Baghdad instead. A number of other possibilities are discussed, including the following: the Secretary of State for India's proposal of a meeting of plenipotentiaries, either at Khurma or Tarabah, as an alternative to a meeting between the two leaders themselves; a suggestion by the High Commissioner, Egypt, that the two leaders meet in London; a proposal from Lord Curzon [George Nathaniel Curzon], Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that Bin Saud should be induced to meet King Hussein on board a British ship at Jeddah, or, as is later suggested, at Aden.Also included are the following:an account from Captain Norman Napier Evelyn Bray, political officer in charge of the Nejd Mission, which recounts the last days of the mission's stay in Paris, in late December 1919;a report from the High Commissioner, Egypt, on his recent meeting with King Hussein, which relays the latter's views on the allocation of control of Syria to France;discussion regarding the growing power and influence of Bin Saud's Akhwan [Ikhwan] forces;a note on the dispute by Harry St John Bridger, in which he volunteers to induce Bin Saud to agree to a meeting at any place (outside of Hejaz) suggested by His Majesty's Government;memoranda and diary entries written by the Political Agent at Bahrain, Major Harold Richard Patrick Dickson, all of which discuss at length Dickson's interviews with Bin Saud at Hasa [Al Hasa] in January and February 1920;extracts from a report by the British Agent, Jeddah, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Edwin Vickery, which recounts his recent interviews with King Hussein and the King's son, Emir Abdullah [ʿAbdullāh bin Ḥusayn al-Hāshimī].The item features the following principal correspondents:Secretary to the India Office's Political Department (John Evelyn Shuckburgh);Civil Commissioner, Baghdad [held in an officiating capacity by Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Talbot Wilson];High Commissioner, Egypt (Field Marshal Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby);Secretary of State for India [Edwin Samuel Montagu];Foreign Office;British Agent, Jeddah (Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Edwin Vickery);Political Agent, Bahrain (Major Harold Richard Patrick Dickson);Bin Saud;Admiralty;Viceroy of India [Frederic John Napier Thesiger].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Agent and Consul General, Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Harry St John Bridger Philby</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Khurma</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Tarabah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hasa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military operations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100032483990.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
