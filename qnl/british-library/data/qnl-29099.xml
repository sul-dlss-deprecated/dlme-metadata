Oppikofer, President of the Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, University Clinic of the Municipal Hospital. To the Passport Department of the British Consulate Sir, In confirmation of our telephone conversation of today, I have pleasure in committing my remarks concerning Dr Friedrich SCURMANN, aged 29. to paper. 1. His character . Dr SCHURMANN, of German birth, brought up in the Protestant faith, has been since 2.1.36., Assistant doctor in the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of the Municipal Hospital, Basle. (Buergerspital, Basle). I value him as a clever,diligent and reliable doctor: he is well thought of also by his fellow Assistants, at v/hose disposal he has invariably placed himself readily and cheerfully. 2. His Medical qualificat ions. He is the Senior Assistant doctor of the hospital and has done four year*s specializing, in fact he was ready to set up as a specialist. Since the mobilisation of Dr Labhardt, the second doctor in command of this hospital, Dr Schurmann has been able to relieve me of difficult cases and to take over responsibilities from me 8 Our Clinic is at present very much dependent on his services as out of a total of five Assistants, almost one half are absent owing to Military Service. I see no reason to expect any improvement in this situation in the next few months and therefore on 26.12.39.&gt; I wrote to the Directorate of the Municipal Hospital asking them to make a specific request to the Police for the extension of Dr Schumann^ permis de sejour here: this was done on 31 . 12 . 39 .&gt; and I have not as yet received any answer from the Police Department. (Aliens Department). 3. Ilis political orientation . Dr SCHURMANN, as I and his fellow Assistants know for certain^ loathes the present German regime and has no intention of going back to Germany. Pie was therefore grateful when the post of Assistant doctor in Bahrein was offered to him.in September, 1939. SD/ Prof. E. OPPIKOFER,indexed . 7^2. r . Allotted to Political Department.

As agreed with you on the telephone I asked Scotland Yard for any information they might have or could obtain for me con cerning this organisation. 2* They informed me that it had come to their notice in October 1938 as sponsoring the application of another German Jew, Franz HAMMERSCHLAG, to come to this country for studies H to fit him for a profession’*. Hainmerschlag and his parents were then in Berlin, he was described as a schoolmaster aged 23, and the Rev. Alexander McLEISH undertook to be entirely responsible for him financially while he was in this country. It was then ascertained that the Rev. Alexander McLEISH was a Minister of the Scottish Church, that he had an income of £700 p.a. and owned the house he lived in at 94&gt; Hillway, and that he was married to a woman doc tor who had retired from practice. Nothing was known to them to his discredit or to that of the World Dominion Movement. 3. They further undertook to secure a report on the World Dominion Movement, a copy of which is herewith attached. From this, it would seem that it is a highly reputable organisation. DVWspecial branch report 2nd December, 1939, Enquiries Have been made regarding the 'Yforld Dominion Movement”, and the following information obtained. 'World Dominion Movement” is a title sometimes used for correspondence purposes by ”Y/orld Dominion Press”, of Pounders Lodge, Mildmay Park, N. 1. The history and activities of this body are as follows About fifteen years ago, one Sidney J.W. CLARK, (now deceased,) a retired business man, who had spent four years in China in connection with missionary work, donated £200,000 for the foundation of a trust, named Survey Application Trust. The objects of this Trust were to set up an information service for the Protestant missionary movement throughout the world, and to assist financially in the establishment of Protestant mission stations. The capital at present is about £150,000, and produces approximately £6,000 per annum. The trustees are: - Dr. Thomas COCHRANE, senior trustee, of St. James’ Court, S.W.l. Dr. Robert COCHRANE, medical superintendent, Lady Willingdon Leper Asylum, Madras, India. Rev. Alexander McLEISH, Church of Scotland Minister, of 94 Killway, N.6. Rev. McLEISH is also the secretary of 'World Dominion Press”. He travels extensively in this connection, and in December 1938 attended the conference of the International Missionary Council at Madras. 'World Dominion Press” is financed by this Trust, and is the medium through which its objects are accomplished. A staff of experts on missionary enterprise is employed, ^v;ith publishing, clerical and mapping departments. There is another branch at 156 Fifth Avenue New York. (The words ’World Dominion’ are intended to represent the Kingdom of God, and are derived from a biblical text.) The information service of this body is given through attendance at missionary conferences, advice to missionary societies, and the publishing of literature. The literature consists chiefly of a series of surveys^on foreign and colonial missionary work, and on the progress of the Protestant movement in various countries. These surveys aeal with the national life of such countries and colonies chiefly from a religious aspect; they often include other aspects, such as cultural and economic but efforts are made to avoid political controversies. Most of the material for these surveys is obtained from reports submitted by missionaries to tneir societies (copies of which are passed on to '(forId Dominion Press ,) from reports received direct from foreignand colonial contacts, and from representatives of foreign missionary bouie®. It is stated that the colonial surveys occasionally^reveal the existence of native injustices and contain strong criticisms nf colonial administration. In a survey on Portuguese African- a - possessions, sucli criticism aroused animosity betv/een the Portuguese Government and missionary societies operating in their ^'colonies, v/hich lead to a personal visit to Lisbon by the Rev. A. McLJISH in an effort to re-establish good relations. It is claimed moreover that a very high standard of accuracy of information is attained in these surveys, and that on a number of occasions they have been utilised by the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office. A bi-monthly international missionary magazine, entitled m tforld Dominion”, is also published. Prior to the outbreak of war a ten-paged bulletin on missionary matters, entitled 'World Information Service', was circulated to religious press bodies from time to time, but the international situation has prevented its continuance. Information on colonial and missionary matters is sometimes given to Members of Parliament for the purpose of Parliamentary questions. Since the outbreak of war two members of the senior staff of 'Yforld Dominion Press' have been engaged in the Ministry of Information. They are :- Kenneth G-. Grubb, supervisor of the South Aaerican section. I. Duval Rice, his assistant.4.1 (Uj Mr SILVER. 27.11.39.

N.1 ~n:- amoL/mp nA n The Under-Seoretary of State, India Office, V/hitehall, S.7/.1. Dear Sir, 16th November, 1939. OOPV SENT GY AIR MAIL I beg to make the following application on behalf of Dr. Friedrich Schiirmann, now working in the Basel Municipal Clinic, for entry into Bahrein, Persian Gulf. Dr. Schiirmann is a Hebrew Christian of a family that is partly Jewish and so has been driven out of Germany. ' He has been domiciled for some time in Basel. For eighteen months we have been searching for a doctor to assist Dr. Harold Storm of the American Mission Hospital, Bahrein. During the summer he was able to borrow a Jewish Christian doctor from Tiberias who has now returned. I have made full investigations regard ing Dr. Schiirmann from the Basel missionary authorities, and enclose herewith certificates of character'from those with whom he has worked in Basel. I personally visited him in August and was convinced that he was a suitable man for the post of Medical Assistant in a mission hospital. Dr. Storm is prepared to receive him if he is per mitted to go for a period of at least three years. Owing to some prejudice against Jews in Bahrein, I was asked to ascer tain whether he looked like a Jew. I was able to report that he did not appear Jewish, and coming from Switzerland and being a Christian he v/ould probably be treated as a Swiss. I am enclosing two photographs and the two most recent communications received from him, the particulars on his passport and his Curriculum-Vitae. I shall be glad to know what further steps should be taken with a view to his proceeding to Bahrein as early as may be possible. Sincerely yours,COPY Dr. Friedrich Schurmann.
