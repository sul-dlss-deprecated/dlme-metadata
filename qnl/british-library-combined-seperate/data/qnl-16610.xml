Greenhill writes of the Persian Government’s commitment to assist English vessels in trouble off the coast of Persia, but accepts that the treaty between the Government and Persia are ‘couched in very general terms’, and that it refers to English vessels, and not to vessels belonging to British native subjects. Greenhill requests that the Resident ascertain the precise terms in which the Bushire factory was re-established in 1775, and whether the terms of the original treaty between Britain and Persia remain in force.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673717.0x000003#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
