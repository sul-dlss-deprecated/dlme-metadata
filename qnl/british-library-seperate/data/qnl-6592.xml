In 1939, the HBM Consul in Kermanshah, John Francis Robert Vaughan Russell, forwarded a letter from Khan to the Accountant General, Central Revenues (Sidney Turner), along with a letter stating his personal support for the pension increase, and these items are included in the file. The file also includes a letter from 1919 with details of Khan's situation and proposed financial aid from James Leslie Rose Weir who was HBM Consul in Kermanshah when Khan first suffered financial losses. Folios 11-12 contain references written by British Government officials in 1916 supporting financial aid for Khan in recognition of his services to them. The file closes with the matter having been referred to the India Office by the Under Secretary to the Government of India for consideration.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Sardar Haider Quli Khan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Accountant-General, Central Revenues</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Pensions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002ac#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002ac#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
