Dear Iftaher, With refei^enoe to your teieuiorte cortveraation of laat Wednesday with Ivood oohoerning the provision of a oar for the of QU0 iostai Superintendent at Bahrain. I am afraid there is nothing much we can add to our letter or the 15 th March to Harrison, a copy of which was sent to pyman. Pyraen has also received a copy of Harrison* s reply of the 22nd liar oh forwarding a copy of a letter from the Residency dated 6th March. Ttiis letter mentions other Post Offices as if there was a them; but in fact there are only two - the main one at Manama, and another, which does very little business, at Muharraq. jirtx It seems to ua/desirable both cm general and on financial grounds to deal with di'e&amp;oh'a application without due consideration of the fact that there must already be a certain nteiiDer of oars provided for official use at Bahrain and this being so we think it pertinent to establish (a) what is done for the people in the Gulf of Breach's status and situation. (Breach has a salary of £5^0 per annun, plus a foreign service allowance of £5/5 per annum.) , (b) to what extent eadTsting resources out there oan be made to meet his proper requirements, and (o the best way of meeting the balance, if any, of auoh requirements. We here are of course not rnlly informed as regards local oiroumstanoes. A J.M. Pisher^^sq.I understand that you are willing to make enquiries on those lines and would bo grateful if you would do so* I am sending copies of this letter to Harrison and Mias Shaw. lours sincerely.* to D.O.No.658-41/13. 1 % 1^ £ * PjSRSIAK GULF asSIDEMcfer 3AHRAIK, ! a irv Dated 8th March 1948.^ 4 #^ r^DExeD . 1 ,^ !', / b I understand that Breach, Postal Superintendent 'C^\ Designate, has approached the G.P.O. London for a small ^ car for official duties and has asked for an allotment of Rs.5,000/- for the purpose. 2. iit present he lives at Jufair (4 miles from the Post Office) and has to hire taxis which are very ex pensive. When his house in Manama is ready, it is considered essential that he should have a car to visit other Post Offices on the island. 3. In the circumstances, I would be most grateful if you could approach the G.P.O. to sanction the ex penditure by telegram, particularly as we have to supply him with a car quite frequently when he cannot get a taxi.

Reterence 70145/4$ © f SERVICES DEPARTMENT, GENERAL POST OFFICE, LONDON, E.C.I. r ilarch, 1948. Dear Harrison, 7 t I enclose copies of letters froji Breach dated the 27th of February and the 6th of Ilarch on the subject of his personal transport at Bahrain. Experience alone will show how much time our Post Office man will nave to spend in Bahrain itself,- - he may have to be away very/.ureoently on visits to the other ports - or what amount of travelling in Bahrain will be necessitated by his official v/ork there. It may not amount to very much after the initial period as his duties will we hope resolve themselves, apart from his office work, into no more than occasional visits of inspection to the local Post Office. He have never in the past been presented with a demand of this sort from other British P.O. Agencies abroad e.g. i-Cvcmt, China, or Morocco and so far as we can judge on the evidence available the provision of an official£*rfc 'for Breaches sole use could not be justified. We do however feel some sympathy with him in the position he describes, and I personally should be uneasy if it were clear tnat he was being treated with less generosity than other British Government officials at Bahrain of equal status and similar situation. The possibility occurs to me that the difficulty is not peculiar to Breach and that there may be some case for the provision of a car for the common use of several officials. However it is obvious that we can take no decision without full knowledge of the existing conditions of the various means which may be possible of meeting the needs to which Breach refers. Such information may of course already be on its way from the Political Resident (see last sentence of the letter of the 6th of March); but if not I should be grateful if you could obtain full details for us, together if you think it appropriate, with the views of the Political Resident, Even if it be established that something must be done P.A.K.

London. 27th February, 1948. I shall be extremely grateful if early consideration can be given to the subject of transport in Bahrain. Walking, although unpleasant and undignified, is not unduly irksome in present weather conditions/- for cfrici&amp;l visits of reasonable distance I do not employ any form of conveyance - but I am assured that in a short time walking, except for very short distances, will be impossible owing to the extreme heat and high humidity. Taxi hire is too expensive for personal use, with the result that I am able to make very few social contacts. The Bahrain Petroleum Company has given me honorary membership of their club at Awali. and in common with all Duropeansm Bahrain I have become a member of the gymkhana Club. They are the only centres of social^intercourse and recreation (including swimming which is essential in this climate). Lack of transport prevents me from making use of tie facilities of either club. All business houses of standing provide cars as a necessary part of the equipment of their employees and all local merchants, and hi^ier government officials, of eastern nationality are owners of the most luxurious cars. A pedestrian Postal Superintendent does not enhance the prestige of the British Post Office. Hay I suggest, therefore, that consideration may be given to the provision of a'car for official and personal use.^ The cost, locally purchased, would be between four and five thousand rupees: a sunu which I know will represent a very small item from the revenue to be chived from the Gulf Agencies. If it cannot be provided officially, perhaps authority can be given for an advance of the necessary amount frcm official funds to be repaid at the end of the period of duty in the Gulf by sale of the car and difference, if any, to be borne by me personally. I would like to make it clear that the subject is raised because I believe it to be one of paramount importance m connection with the maintenance of good health and official prestige and in view of the rapidly approaching hot weather, I shall be grateful if the P.S.D. will give it urgent consideration. » (3gd) H.C. BHJilASH.GOPI ^ r 1 iT.Kir-irt ijfs Postal Superintem^ent, Persian Gulf Agencies. To* The Postal Services Department, (O.M.B.; G.P.O., London 6th March, 1948. Referring to my letter of the 27th of February on the subject of transport in Bahrain, the position has now become very urgent. X have been sharing the official residence, in Manama, of Mr. Galver the manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran, but the arrangement has ceased owing to the arrival of his European assistant, ho other accommodation is available in Manama and I am now living with Major Dredge, Secretary to the political Resident. His hpuse is in the Residency compound some fours miles from Manama and official transport is not available after the first journey into the town each day. For ray official work I am sharing the office oi the Public Relations Department of the Political Agency and two attendances are necessary. I have been obliged to make an arrangement with a taxi driver for the additional journeys at the cost of eight rupees daily which, although cheap as taxi fares go in Bahrain, is an.extremely heavy expenditure. It is, however, unavoidable in the.circumstances and I understand that a cornmunicationSi on the subject is being despatched by the Political Resident. (3gd) K.C.
