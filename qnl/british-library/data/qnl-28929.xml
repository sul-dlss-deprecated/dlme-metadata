Purchase o f Land at Magil in Mesopotamia. As you are aware I have deferred dealing with this question until I had had an opportunity of going into it with the India Office which, for various causes, has not 'been possible until recently. I have now discussed the question at considerable length with a representative of the India Office (Mr. C. C. G-arbet t) . The position is, as I understand it, that a considerable amount of land at Magil has for some years past been in the occupation of the de facto Administration of Mesopotamia acting under the authority of the G.O.C. in C. of the British Forces, that the original owners have been dispossessed and that no formal transfer of their land has been taken. I do not know whether they have or have not up to the present received any compensation or other payment for ^he land in question. I understand that for financial reasons it is desired to purchase the land outright by the payment of a lump sum to cover the whole of the owner's claim and not to make any separate payment in respect of compensation for user of the land. These transactions all took place some considerable time before the question was referred to me. Owing to the anomalous position of sovereignty in Mesopotamia it is difficult to advise with any confidence on the question of the party to whom the land should be tran=ferrou here seem to be three possible courses;- !. to transfer the land to the new Mesopotamian State. The objection to this course is that no such State is t present in existence, the present Administration of esopotamia being that of an enemy force in occupation of ttoman territory.( 2 ) 2 * T ° transfer the land to Whatever authority at present ' ho 1 &amp;s immovable property in Mesopotamia belonging to the Ottoman State. if this were done the property so trans ferred would pass with the rest of the Ottoman State land m accordance with whatever terns may he laid down by the Peace Treaty. It is possible however that this might give rise to financial complications and that the validity of tiie transfer itself might 'be questioned in view of the fact that the Ottoman Government, though retaining theoretical sovereignty, is not in a position to be a party to the transaction. These points could only be determined when the exact text of the Peace Treaty is known. 3* To transfer the land to some Department representing the British Crown either directly or through a nominee. The objections to this course would be (a) The extra-territorial character which the land would assume and which would prevent the land coming under the jurisdiction of the Mesopotamian Courts. This would no doubt be a serious objection both politically and from the point of view of the practical administration of such property as a railway siding and docks. (b) 'The fact that the Turkish Law, as I understand, does not permit land to be held by nominees. I understand that the registered owner is always regarded by Turkish law as the true owner, and that it would be necessary from time to time to transfer the land from v one nominee to another, while if the nominee died considerable difficulties would arise by reason of the applicability of the Mahommedan laws of inheritance under which, as I understand, only one-third of the property can be disposed of by Will and the balance must be divided among.the legal heirs. In view of these difficulties I am unable to recommend that any of these courses should be adopted, and it seemsto me to be advisable to defer the completion of the transfer of the land until the new Mesopotamian State is constituted. When this is done the most convenient course would appear to be to transfer the land to the Mesopotamian State or such authority as may be constituted by that State. T understand that a considerable amount of expenditure made by the British Government on permanent works in Mesopotamia, such as railway lines, will be treated as a debt from the Mesopotamian State to the British Government, and presumably money expended on the acquisition of these lands should be treated in the same way. If this course is adopted I do not think there need be any obstacle to the payment of compensation or purchase money to the original owners provided that in each case their title to the land is established and they give- a receipt in full discharge of all claims, together with an undertaking to execute whatever further documents may be required to vest the land as above indicated. I am informed that under Ottoman Law the payment of purchase money is not sufficient to make an unregistered transfer of land valid against all parties, and I do net see any other practical solution except to adopt the course suggested above and to rely upon legislation of the Mesopotamian State to cure any technical irregularity in the position. Possibly assistance in this direction may be obtained from the terms of the Peace Treaty with Turkey. I annexe a duplicate of this minute for your use. (intd.)

On pa^e 5 of the Volume attached you will see that the only corporations which can own immovable property are Ottoman Communities, and the class of property is limited to house property in towns and villages. I am not certain whether the Mapril estate would come under this cate/rory; and at any rate while a state of war continues, it will be difficult for the War Office to be constituted an Ottoman community! I am afraid we shall have to fall back on the ori/nnal sucrestion of committing an act technically illegal and having it validated in the Treaty. If you would be p*ood enough in your official letter to the War Office (of which a copy mipht be sent to us?) to lay stress on this point, I will see that it is kept before the Drafting Com?nittee. In the only Draft of the Treaty which I have seen, there is such provision already made but it is well to make certain. Yours sincerely, C.C.

Assistant Solicitor to tfte Treasury, WLitemil, S.w. •' * 3 S 7 Sir, 1 / .. ^ ^ f &gt; ' I regret that pressure of worX : ha:S;;;mde it difficult for * me to answer your letter of 12 th November* I have also waited to get hold of a hooK on Ottoman land law to confirm my recollection. The hooK which I have before me does not give the later Ottoman land legislation which was passed after the revolution, “but so far as my memory serves me I do not thinic that there is anything in this later legislation which seriously affects the question except perhaps upon one or two points. Generally speaking, at Ottoman law title to land depends upon registration. There are two main classes of land viz. muiic land and mirie land. Mulic land is land situated in towns and villages and land not exceeding half an acre appurtenant to dwelling houses. The owner of mulK land has full chattel ownership. The|owner of mirie land has perpetual right to the enjoyment of the surface (Huquq-i-tessaruf) while the legal ownership (Raqabe) is in th^State and is vested in the Treasury (Beit ul Mai). On escheat, the full ownership, in the case of muli: land, and the huquq-i-tessaruf, in tne case fcf mirie land reverts to the Treasury. The land is considered to be mahloul (vacant), is sold and the proceeds are paid to the Treasury. I have no knowledge of how land upon which Ottoman Govern ment public buildings are situated is actually registered, but if the underlying theory of Ottoman land tenure is applied I should expect to find that the registration officials looxed J upon it as land that belonged to the Treasury in the same way as land in respect of which there has been an Escheat. Inasmuc]i as no pr ivate person would iiave a title deed to the land it could only vest in the Treasury, If 1he land tenure in Mesopotamia has not been fundamentally altered (and I should he surprised to hear that it has been) by the occupied territory administration, land bought and paid for by administration funds would automatically become vested in the Treasury (which would now be represented oy the financial service of the administration)* Tne land would remain the property of the State whatever tne international status of Mesopotamia subsequently became. It may however be the intention that the land bought sHould not -become Mesopotamian State property, but rAter tne property of tne British Government. Considerable difficulties would appear to arise. Theoretically, until a peace treaty is signed and a definite cession of territory is made, Mesopo tamia is Ottoman territory and no foreign Government can hold land in it. Such land as is held in TurKey by foreign Governments (e.g. Eimassies) is X believe, held under a special deed from the Sultan. The only suggestion which occurs to me is the following. Recent Ottoman legislation (1913-1913) enabled judicial persons to hold land and it might be possible to form a small company all the shares in which could be held by an official on the spot as nominee of the British Government and the land in question could be registered in the name of the Company. I have not the text of the law in question before me and cannot recollect whether it enabled foreign companies as well as Ottoman companies to hold land, but this legislation must be available in Mesopotamia and the question whether an Ottoman or a British company should be formed could be decided according to the terms of the law. I nave considered the question of vesting the land in a local nominee but X cannot recommend the solution. A re cent law expressly forbids the holding of land by nominees and,thpugli in practice it was a dead letter a,nd nracii land is, I Relieve, so held, I cannot advise tne adoption of a course whicii is strictly speaking illegal and whicii might lead to . difficulties in the future.

IW” 1 D* L* 1 Purchase of certain land at Magil Mesopotamia, from Army Funds With reference to your Minute, 4.11•19, in 121/3/1044 , this matter involves questions of legal technicality arising under the local laws, upon which I can only express a prirn'a facie opinion, subject to revision by expert legal advice which presumably must be sought upon the spot or possibly at Constantinople from Mr. Henry Pears, an English barrister, who for many years has been practising there and is familiar with the technicalities of Ottoman law. Under existing conditions, no such expert legal advice appears to be available in England. I infer from the correspondence that H.M.Government desires to conform to the requirements of the Ottoman law, apart from the exercise of any powers resulting from the military occupation. Under the Imperial Ottoman Rescript of the 18th June 1867, of which a copy extract is annexed, the right of holding real property in the Ottoman Empire (except in the Province of the Hedjaz) was conceded to foreigners. I understand that in Turkey the ownership of real property is evidenced by registration in the competent court. Unless it shall appear upon expert legal advice that the Ottoman law provides to the contrary, I think that the property in question may be registered in the name( 2 ) n8rne of the General Officer Commanding in Chief in either of the two ways mentioned in the letter of the India Office 30&lt;&gt;9«19, provided that it be expressed in the document of title that the property is transferred to him (a) es quality, that is ; in his representative gfficial character, or (b) as the attorney of the Secretary of State in virtue of a power duly given in that behalf. ’ ' ^ ' The General Officer Commanding in Chief, in either /!. character as indicated above, would be able in due course to make a valid transfer of the property as may be hereafter determined and directed./ y Sear Sir Alexander Lawrence, Pleaae see your letter of t e 12 th November Ho. 1828/1919 A'VL/JBC to Mr. Shuckburgh relative to the purchase of land at Kagil, Keeopotamia.

The papers in this matter have been sent to me by the Directorate of Lands for advice as to the proper party to whom land in Mesopotamia should be conveyed. It must depend to a certain extent upon the law of He al property in force in Mesopotamia, and I am trying to obtain edvioe as to the procedure usually adopted in such cases from an officer who has a good deal of experience of Turkish and Egyptian £*w. It would be useful, however, if you could give me any indication as to the future status of the territory in w^leh the land is situated especially a s to whether the Turkish law which has presumably been in force there will be retained or will be superseded by some other system. The law of real property and with regard to Trusts differs enormously in different countries, and even between different provinces of the same country. I do not know how far the capitulations in Turkey affect the tenure of reel estate by persons who had the benef it of the capitulations, or whether the Turkish Government *s abolition of the capitulations has been accepted as valid, or whether the capitulations will be abolished or modified in some way under the new Regime. It might be useful if you could eome and discuss the matter at your convenience. Yours sincerely. J.E.Shuckburgh, Esq., C.B., India Office. hy.

It is quite understood that the War Office is anxious to have proper title deeds to support its expenditure in this connection but I ,/ould strongly recommend that the ownership should be vested not in that Department but in the name of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in Mesopotamia, who is the War Department representative and also under international lav/ the source of all authority # in the occupied territories, until seme other form of Government is duly set up. 3 .3 . lt iS pres ™ ed ’ that a11 property of permanent value to the Administration acquired at expense of military estimates such as Port, land for railway station, and other asoets of -'hioh the Port and 'i’erminus at Basra is only orite iwem, wi.il eventually 'be handed over at a valuation to the Iraq State, under some system to he eventually determined oy hek.

Having regard to tbe difficulty of determining whether a surplus of sufficient amount will remain on the revenues of the occupied territories when the claims of the bondholders fall to be met and to the special nature of the service, My Lords think that the whole of the expenditure should be met from Army Votes supplemented by the Vote of Credit. The Army Council have agreed in this course, but suggest that the transaction should be noted as an item for special consideration if there is an eventual settlement between Army and Civil Bunds in respect of capital expenditure of this kind.

From-CaPTAiN A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., D.S.O., Chief Political Officer, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. r I have the honour to state that an area of about 4)^- acres in Basrah has acquired under instructions, from the Military Authorities for the erec- tioiTthereon of a Central Power Station. 2 . The land in question is situated close to Ashar on the Ashar Creek y on plan attached. between the main Ashar-Magil road and the American Mission and constitutes a very valuable building site. The date trees have since been felled, the level of the ground raised by several feet, and permanent buildings and machinery of great value erected. 3 . After careful enquiry into the value of the land, having regard to pre war rates of adjoining parcels, the sum of Rs. 20,000 was paid to the owners of a half share of the 4 } acres referred to without resort to compulsory purchase, in which case, having regard to the current value of land, a higher price might have had to be paid. The other half of the property is Dhurriyah Waqf and the owners are unwilling, if not unable, to sell. Negotiations are in progress to exchange some Saniyah land of equal value for this area. 4 . A further sum of Rs. 43,533 has been expended as compensation for the destruction of houses, the property of private persons on an adjoining _ , ■ , area of about three acres of Government X on plan attached. , , land which has also been taken over for the erection thereon of plant connected with the Power station. These houses were acquired under Regulation ‘ hellth 0ct °' &gt;er 1916 ' No. 10 of 1916 (vide the Iraq Occupied Territories Code). 5 . Having regard to the fact that the Power Station will on the con clusion of hostilities presumably he taken over by the Civil Administration of Basrah and of the immense advantages already derived therefrom by the local population, it seems reasonable to debit the cost of acquisition of the above land and houses to Basrah Revenues.

I forward herewith a detailed statement showing the lines on which the assessment has been made. I am not prepared to recommend that the cost of the above should, in the first instance, be debited to the military estimates but consider that the sanction of the Government should.be obtained direct to purchase the same and eventually debit the entire cost against the revenues of the occupied territories when they are in a position to meet this expenditure. I shall be glad of an early reply as to whether this sanction is given, as it seems desirable to proceed with the purchase at once. Chief Political Office, Basrah, 2gth November igi6. No. 13780—50-2. D. Q. M. G. Your Q.-1303-23 of October 1 st. With reference to the correspondence ending with my Memo. No. 9984- 50-2, dated October 3rd, regarding the acquisition of land at Magil, 1 have the honour to state that 1 have now received the preliminary report of the Officiating Revenue Commissioner upon the subject. 2. It is estimated that the acquisition of the area shown shaded on the attached map, including Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ property, can be acquired for about 15 lakhs of rupees or say ^ 100,000. 3. If it is desired to acquire the area outlined in red, the additional cost will be 22 lakhs, or nearly ;£ 150,000 over and above the £ 100,000 referred to above. The I. G. C.j Base Commandant, D. G. P. A. and R. C. and Director of Works concur with me in thinking it unnecesary to incur at present this addi tional expenditure, whilst agreeing as to the necessity of acquiring the land mentioned in paragraph 2 which has been so altered by military engineers as to have practically ceased to have an agricultural value. 4. They consider it desirable, however, to acquire the strip of foreshore 500 yards deep, striped, which will probably cost about 5 lakhs, as this is already being used for permanent dockyard and other works which are likely to extend, more particularly when the Magil-Basrah Railway Line, as has been proposed runs 500 yards distant from and parallel to the river. With this view I generally concur and the cost and ownership of the addi tional strip required will be investigated in due course. Both this strip and the area referred to in paragraph 2 have or will shortly be occupied entirely by military requirements the water being cut off and the ground reclaimed. Land thus treated practically loses its agricultural value and we have either to pay the inhabitants the equivalent of the crop or else acquire it, and it has been decided in principle that acquisition is the preferable course. I would sl419ad&amp; therefore recommend that with a view to expediting disposal of f the H ^ at er A • ^ Commander should accord his sanction to the carrying out of the acqu and the debit of the cost in the first instance to military estimates, as bei g frimafacie work undertaken as a result of military operations and at the instance of the military authorities. As soon however as the money has been paid and the transaction closed, l would propose with the approval of the A y Commander to approach Government with a view to obtaining their sanction t the debit of the whole cost of the land mentioned m paragraphs 2 and 4 abo e, to the Revenues of the Occupied Territories. This procedure will be in accor dance with the recent ruling of the Government of India on the subject. (Sd.) P. z cox, Chief Political Officer* Note on the proposed Acquisition of land in the Magil Area. 1. General (a).—I have during the past fortnight made a detailed inspection of the whole Magil area from the Jubaila creek on the South to the boundary ot Garmat Ali on the North and have prepared a record of rights for the whole area except the Jubaila tract, which may, I think, be taken t0 be complete at any rate for acquisition purposes though not perhaps as a final authoritative record, the preparation of such a record being unnecessary until^ Government decides how much of the area to acquire. The record of rights is attached to this note as Appendix “ A.” The survey numbers given therein refer to the holdings marked out and numbered after local inspection on the 16 inch map repared by the Survey Department. (b) The Magil area is roughly about 2000 acres in extent and is bounded on the North by Garmat Ali, on the East by the Shatt-al-Arab, cm the South by the Jubaila creek and on the west by the desert from which it is separated by a Rofa or embankment. It comprises the following sub-divisions nameiy.— - (1) the jubaila tract about 600 acres, (2) the tract between the Rumaili and Abul Sabur creeks, (3) the tract between the latter creek and the Garmat Ali boundary. The area of the last two together is just over 14 00 acres. (c) The whole area is demarcated by a red pencil line on the accompanying map ; the area which has already been or should certainly be taken up for military purposes is demarcated by a blue pencil line. The area between the blue and red pencil lines has not been occupied except for a few. small patches in the Jubaila tract, which should, I thmk for reasons to be explained later, be evacuated if possible. These two areas have been roughly sub-divided by red ink lines to shew the comparative values of the various sub-divisions according to my estimate, each sub division being designated by the letters A, B, C or D in accordance with its classification in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th class respectively for valuation purposes. Each class has been further sub-divided into homogeneous blocks to facilitate a decision as to what areas to acquire, such sub-divisions being numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. 2. Proposals regarding Acquisition.- (a) It has not yet been made clear whether acquisition proceedings are to be confined to the immediate and future requirements of the military situation or are intended to be at least to some extent of a speculative nature with a view to possible future developments in this area in the event of our occupation becoming permanent, in which case, of course, there can be little doubt that Magil will become a very important commercial centre. I gather however that, while the immediate object of the proposed acquisition is essentially military, the desirability of keeping the other point of view in mind has not been overlooked. (^) Whatever the object in view there can be no question but that the whole of the central or blue pencil area should and must be acquired. A very3 considerably portion of it has actually been occupied for one purpose or another by our troops and much of the remainder has been rendered of little practical value to the owners partly by the damming of irrigation channels and the damage to crops resulting therefrom and partly by the difficulty if not impossibility under present conditions of protecting the ripe crop from the depredations of troops, coolies, cattle and other pilferers. I tkink it will be agreed that we must acquire this area or pay rent or compensation for the occupation thereof and there can be no doubt that acquisition is the more economical process. (c) I pass on to the question of acquiring the area between the blue and red pencil lines. With the few exceptions in the Jubaila tract already mentioned at i (c) above, this area has not been occupied and its acquisition could scarcely be justified except as an admitted speculative venture. There are two sub tract s to be considered namely (:) the Jubaila tract, and the Abul-Sabur-Garmat Ali tract. Id) With regard to the former mention must be made of the legal complica tions likely to arise in connection with any attempt to acquire the area known as the Jaibachi Dhurrvja waqf which constitutes the greater and most valuable portion of the Jubaila tract. A Dhurriya Waqf is not so much a religious endowment—in fact it is a a waqf only in name though none the less perpetu ally protected from alienation by the Turkish Laws—as a property entailed in perpetuity in the interests of the heirs of the original entailer with a reversion to charitable and religious purposes in the event of the extinction of the entailers line. We can of course ride rough shod over any inconvenient provision of the Turkish Laws on the strength of the simple Fiat of the Army Command er and there can be no question that such action would be fully justifiable under International Law if necessitated by military considerations, but m this case Such ustTficadon scarcely exists and I submit that we should if possible abide by the Turkish Law. Only small portions of the area—perhaps 20 acres in all out of have been touched and there is ample space for present requirements and future developments in the central area and further up towards Garmat Ah and I therefore strongly recommend that the Jubaila tract be who ly and definite y excluded from the acquisition programme such portions as are already occupied being evacuated as soon as convenient and orders being issued that no other portions shall be taken up without the previous express sanction of the Army Commander. IA With regard to the Abul-Sabur-Garmat Ali area there is no objection . v Lm, lion thereof but I venture to think it should not be acquired unless t0 ! ;1 \ : difinitely required for military purposes and then only on the Inrtionothe ArmyCotnmander. As far as I can judge the only grounds for sanction ottne nrmy are speculative, the idea being that we should*buv'up the find when it'can be bought cheap under war conditions lest we should be confronted with a rise in land values after the war. 1 mention that owing to the absence of Abdul Latif at Mandil 1 may ™enti d g relating to his family’s property, I have wbo is s Y d ‘°e!rtain definitely whetlJr the Mandil family claim to ownership been unable to a-cert y sus ; a j ne d. I would not be surprised if of ‘he desert portion ofS op S erty . This matter 1 propose to the land turned out to b G ^ J ^ convenient if the area coMdas proposed by me be excluded from the acquisition programme until my investigation can be pursued. (/I !“* 1 not go above a fair market p . , , m|] , t be re a U l a ted by the crops which it because the value of agricultural ■ speculative value as being suit- can produce.

The market value of land for building purposes would accordingly be regulated by the willingness or otherwise of Government to grant permission (or building and, if w this were done very sparingly and always after careful consideration of the needs of Government and the general public, land values would not have any tendency to become unduly inflated and Government could always acquire at agricultural rates. (g) For the reasons adduced above I would suggest that only the central area be acquired but I propose to deal for convenience with the financial aspect of all possible alternatives, always however on the assumption that the blocks into which I have divided the whole area will be treated as integral units. _ I may here summarise the results at which I have arrived in accordance with calculations explained hereafter. (h) Appendix “ C ” shews the total assessed value of the central block to be Rs. 9,54,626 of which Rs. 1,38,292—(w'dte Appendix “ D ”) will not be payable in cash, this amount representing the value of land, which is already the proper ty of Government, Waqf lands, which should be acquired by exchange as propos ed hereafter, land which may be treated as enemy property and sequestrated, and cemeteries, grave yards, etc. The net value of this area is therefore some Rs. 8,15,034 to which must be added the following sums, namely Rs.

Assessment of L^nd Values —{a) I attach as Appendices B and C to this note statements showing (i) the composition as regards detailed holdings according to my record of rights of each block or sub-division of the Magil area with the assessed value of each holding and block and (2) the financial effect of acquiring the blue pencil area, the Jebaila tract and the Abul Sabur tracts severally and collectively. ✓ Th6se statements read with 2 (^and (/) above will enable the authorities concerned to decide what to acquire with a full knowledge of the probable cost of each alternative. My estimate must be taken as liable to a slight amount of variation in one direction or the other but I think l can guarantee that, in the event of my receiving instructions to proceed with the acquisition, there will not be more than 5 per cent difference in either direction. ( 3 ) My first object in attempting to arrive at a correct valuation of the land to be acquired was to discover what sales had actually taken place in recent times—and particularly during the period immediately preceding the outbreak of uar—and the rates at which such sales had been made. The following cases have come to my notice and have been of material assistance in framing my estimates, namely :—* (1) The purchase of some 88’! 2 acres (according to our survey) by Agah Jafar from (a) Hiskail Hayyin and (b) Said Effendi a very short time before the outbreak of war both transactions being registered in our Tapu Department since the occupation. Ot this area, which stretches back from the Shatt along the Magil Canal and comprises some of the mcst valuable land in the Magil area, Agna Jafar bought 54’75 acres from the first named vendor for Rs. 1,77,750 plus an extra Rs. 7,500 for the house on the river bank or Rs. 1,85,250 in all and 33*37 acres (according to our survey though recorded as only 8 acres in the official documents) for Rs. 6,075. The latter transaction constitutes an obvious fraud but Government gains rather than loses by it as it is entitled to assume that the price named and no more was actually paid for the full area according to actual measurements. In point of fact Agha Jafar acting as the agent of the original owners i.e the Zuhair family sold the land to his own clerk, Said Etfendi, and bought it back from him as stated—a decidedly shady transac- ticn but it was the Zuhair family that suffered. So far as Agha Tafar is concerned, he is, 1 suppose, entitled to receive from us in payment for the whole land the actual sum which he is known to have paid for it, i.e., Rs. 1,83,825 plus Rs. 7 , 5 °° ll ; e hou f« or Rs. 1,01,325 in all. On the other hand we are entitled to assess the value of the whole land so bought on the basis of the •1449AD! ki t. 'U former sum for the purposes of the valuation of follow's as a rough guide for our acquisition operations, namely: Class A. Survey No. 23 = 34'5 a c res at 2 &gt; 5 00 P er acre Class B. Survey No. 12 and 28 = 38-8 acres at 2,000 per acre Class C. Survey Nos. 11 , 25 and 27=24 82 acres at 1,852 per acre Total ••• Add for house ••• Total due Rs. 61,250 77,600 44.975 1,83,825 7 &gt; 5 °o i, 9 '&gt; 3 2 5 f The average works out rather high on this shewing but, though we must nav Agha Jafar himself this sum, we need not follow this estimate slavish y in every case in view of the fact that his venture was admittedly speculative and did not represent the value of the land at the time. should be mclmed to leave the class A estimate as it is and to reduce class B to Rs. 1,800 per acre and class 0 to Rs. 1,500 as a rough valuation guide to be compared with other available material and it will be seen later that I have made further reductions on these estimates while I have a ready treated the difference between the price actually paid by Agha Jafar for the land and its assessed value as a bonus to be paid to Agha Gatar as a matter of grace. We are not bound to pay this extra sum on the merits of the case. (2') Ali ibn Abdul Latif sold his share in a piece of land on the Abul Sabur to Abbas, etc., aulad Tahir in July 19.6 for Rs. 2,700. His share was 1 -8th of 14*56 acres or 1*82 which gives a rate of Rs. 1,373 per acre for excellent date land. (nV'Mutlaq Beg al Sadun sold a bit of land measuring 4-34 acres on the south of the Abul Sabur Canal for Rs. 38,000 or Rs. 5 066 to Salman ibn Hamud about 4 years ago. This is also good date land with excellent irrigation facilities and the sale price gives a value of only Rs. 1,167 per acre. (4) A Turkish subject of Polish origin named Zabloski purchased a strip of land near the Magil creek in the Shatt measuring 15/49 acres for £T.-1725 which is land equal in every way to Agha Jafar’s land already referred to. 1 he purchase was made in 1912-13 and may be taken as a good valuation guide. It works out at about Rs- 1,600 per acre. (c) (i) The estimate of values arrived at above may best be tested by the application of the principle that 20 years purchase of the annual value of the land is a fair valuation, *'&lt;?., that the ordinary reasonable man invests his funds m speculative enterprises on the assumption that he will make 5 P er cen ^ ^ 1S money and recover his capital outlay in 20 years whereafter the proceeds of the enterprise will be clear profit. (2) To apply the principle we have to discover the value of the annual profits of the Magil lands to their owners. The Turkish principle that Govern ment is generally entitled to the Khums or i*5th of the total produce 01 land and the actual assessment made by the Turks with a view to attaining this ideal are indispensable guides in this quest. (3) The normal fixed Land revenue rate at Magil is ^T. 1 or Ps. 100 per iarib (we may say per acre) on fully developed groves and we may assume that the value of the normal total produce of the date groves taxed at this rate is ^Ts. 5 or Ps. 500 per acre of which i-5th goes to Government. i-5th to the tenant i e., on the labour of cultivation and 3-5ths to the landlord. The landlord’s share is therefore ^T. 3 or Ps. 300 per acre per annum and the(I St in to ere her i to eta bur '8th ent the ibn ion pof 7 2 S Ihe It the and 3 in ihis the ma! em* and [are c Ps. may ;d ^ i-Stl' • Tke i Ike 7 value of the land in the market is £6o or Ps. 6,ooo at 20 years purchase i.e., at our present rate of exchange Rs. 857 per acre. This estimate is based on the assumption that Ps. 100 per acre represents a normal i-5th of the total produce but this is not really so. We must try and arrive at a more exact produce estimate. 1 . (4) We have so far collected very little in the way of data for the estimation of date crops and we shall of course not be able to carry out the elaborate crop experiments required for the purpose until the coumry settles down to regular administration with a numerous staff of Revenue officials. We know however that a tree which produces ^ maund of dates is considered considerably above the average and working on rough indications we may assume that 1-3 maund per tree is a fair average fer trees of good quality^ while 1-4 maund and 1 “5 maund would be fair averages for proportionately less good land, less than 1-5 of a maund per tree being a poor average, we may also fairly safely assume that 5 per maund is a good all-round average market price for dates, though, to attain anything like complete accuracy, we ought strictly speaking to differentiate between the various kinds of dates, there being a separate set of ever fluctuating rates for Halawis, Khadrawis, Sairs and all the other varieties^ Each acre may be assumed if properly planted to contain about 100 trees. (5) The average values on these calculations are as follows (1) 1-3 x 100 X 5=about Rs. 160 per annum. (2) 1-4x100x5= „ 125 „ (3) 1-5x100x5= „ 100 „ Government’s share at i-5th should be as follows (0 Rs. 32- (2) Rs. 25. (3) Rs. 20. As a matter of fact it is roughly as follows :— (1) Rs. 14 at the rate of Ps 100 per acre. (2) Rs 11 „ „ Ps. 80 do. (3) Rs. 7 „ „ Ps. 50 do. So the landlord, supposing he pays the tenant a full i*5th profits per acre as follows, receives the following amounts per acre per annum, namely » ( 1 ) Rs. 160 minus (32 + 14 ) = Rs. IH* ( 2 ) Rs. 125 „ ( 35 + n) = Rs. 89 . ( 3 ) Rs. 100 „ ( 20 + 7 ) =Rs. 73 - We may say roughly in (1) Rs. no per acre*. in (2) Rs. 90 per acre, in ( 3 ) Rs. 70 per acre. 6. The land values on this calculation would be as follows :— (1) Rs. uox 2 o= Rs. 2,200 per acre. ( 2 ) Rs. 9 oX 2 o = Rs. 1,800 per acre. (3) Rs. 70 x 20 = Rs. 1,400 per acre. On the other hand we have to bear in mind that we are calculating not on the cast but on the next co years, in respect of which we are ent,tied to put our land P revenue assessment up^ to the full Khums. Th.s we are certamly ent,tied to do for valuation purposes and the following are the results we obtain : ( 1 ) Rs. 160 minus 64 = Rs. 96 x 2 o = Rs. i, 9 20 - ( 2 ) Rs. 125 „ so = Rs. 75 X 20 = Rs. 5 , 50 °. ( 3 ) Rs. 100 4o = Rs. 60 x 20 = Rs. 1 , 200 ../ J 8 (^) (i) The result of an examination of the values ascertained from the actual sales within our cognizance are as follows : For ist Class For Second Class.

Much of it (the greater part of it) would in normal circumstances have remained undeveloped for many years to come and when planted would take some 8 years before it could be classed as 3rd class date land. We may I think safely conclude that such land would return no profits for the next 12 or 15 years and would then begin to yield say Rs. 70 per annum per acre to the landlord. Its purchase value would then be 7oX2o=Rs. 1,400 or thereabouts of which some Rs. 500 or 600 would cover the 8 or 5 years remaining of the 20 years period calculated from the present time and against this we have to set the capital which would have to be sunk in developing it. Prior to the occupation such land could have been purchased for ^5 ^ IO an gcre and my estimate of ^20 errs if at all on the side of generosity. Nevertheless I would submit that Government should accept this estimate as the land has undoubtedly appreciated in value in consequence of the British occupa- t\ovi \uide s 23 (j) ‘ Firstly ’ of the Land Acquisition Act as modified by G. O. C. Regulation No. 6 of igi6) and we should make some allowance for this fact. The matter is not of very great importance as practically the whole area of this class in the central tract belongs to Government, though the Zuhair family has pretensions to its ownership, pretensions which we can ^safely disregard in the absence of title-deeds. (f) (l) I have disposed according to my lights of the question of land values and there remains only that of the value of buildings. These fall into two classes, namely • (1) Buildings of a special nature. (2) Ordinary mud buildings. (2) 'With regard to the former there are only two such buildings namely (1) Agha Jafar’s masonry building on the Shatt to which reference has already been made, and of which the recorded value is Rs. 7500. This should be the acquisition price; and (2) Lynch’s Dock and other buildings- which will have to be valued separately by an expert in the valuation of buildings. (3) With regard to latter class, which comprises the village of Kut ai Farangi itself and various mud buildings attached to date gardens I think the simplest plan will be to treat the lands and the buildings thereon as fully planted date land of the category into which it falls according to my classification. (4) An alternative method would be to take l*3rd of the date land values as representing the value of the bare land and to assess each building.separately as may be possible. I think the owners of the houses would prefer the former system and as the area and number of houses involved are not very great I think Government might reasonably accept that method as being both simpler and more generous to the owners than any strict assessment of house value could be. The amount involved is not very large. ( 5 ) » these proposals are accepted we shall pay Rs. 7 ;00 to Agha Jafar for his house and treat all other houses as fully planted date lands and the only building to be dealt with will be Lynch’s. I have asked Mr. Timewell to put in a claim and will take up the matter of valuation separately. As the buildings are being employed largely on Government work, the matter does not press. (g) Graveyards have been valued but will not of course be a cquired, while the property of the Turkish Government involves no cash pay ment. It will however be a matter for consideration how we are to treat the prope-ty (15 acres) which stands in the name of one Zabloski, who purchased it on behalf of the Baghdad Railway Company. The simplest plan would be to treat the pro perty as German-owned and^to take it over pending such settlement as may be made after the war. There only remains the question of the many little bits of, waqf property totalling in all some 9J acres, which are scattered about in the area to be acquired. I have valued them in accordance with my general scheme and propose that they be exchanged for a tract of similar value out of the Saniya properties at Dasiji. No payment will be made for any of the above property, the whole of which should be registered like all other property to be acquired in this area in the name of the Saniya Department. (4) Remission of Land Revenue.—-{a) Whatever land may be acquired the whole of the present land revenue assessment thereon will have to be remitted with effect from this year, i.e., 1916-17 inclusive on the assumption that the land became Government property with effect from say September. 1st i9!6, i.e., before the date harvest was ready. This will obviate the necessity of a lo win § any compensation for loss of this year’s crop or any part of it. The tenants and owners have reaped the benefit of the crop such as it remained after the depreda tions already referred to. We need, however, make no claim on them m respect of it ncr admit any liability to compensation for damage done.(b) This arrangement will save the trouble of: (i) Assessing the actual loss of crop resulting from acquisition, (ii) Assessing the amount of crop collected by the owners and repayable to Government as owner by requisition ; and (3) Collecting the land revenue. (c) I may remark that at this stage (i) and (2) are impossible as a clean sweep has now been made of everything. The owners will not and cannot reasonably object if we remit the land revenue due from them this year as above proposed and pay them the assessed value of this land less any cash compensa tion they may have received already. They may claim interest on the assessed value of the lands acquired and it will be for consideration whether interest at say 6 per cent should be granted but, if orders regarding acquisition are issued without delay and the money paid at once, the question of interest need not arise. Payment should if possible be made before the end of this calendar year. (d) The amount of land revenue to be remitted in perpetuity depends entirely on the actual areas that it is decided to acquire. The land revenue now payable is shewn against each folding so far as it has been possible to ascertain it and amounts to Rs. 5,335 per annum exclusive of areas, such as the Waqf holdings, on which -|th of the produce is taken annually in kind. The fixed revenue is assessed on owners not on individual holdings and it will be necessary to work out the proportions to be struck off the revenue roll on receipt of orders regarding the area to be acquired. The land revenue Iksessment on the Jubaila tract is not included in the above. (5) Future management of the area. — (a) I have proposed above that the whole'of the area-to be acquired should be registered in the name of the Saniya or Crown Land Department. No other arrangement is, I think, feasible. If this is done the Saniya Department should appoint a special Sirkar for the manage ment of the whole property, of which the military will of course during the period of the war, have the free and unrestricted use, but I would suggest that the Officer in charge of the Magil Municipality should be made responsible to the Saniya Department for the Administration of the area and that trees should not be cut down or canals blocked without his permission in order that the agricultural nature of the tract be preserved as far as possible and steps taken to recover the produce of the trees that remain for the benefit of the Saniya Department. This Department will probablv find it most convenient to recover the produce by farm ing it to the highest bidder as in the case of other Saniya properties. With a little enterprise it should also be possible to plan out a scheme for the develop ment of the area with an eye to the uses to which it will be put in the future. (6) The payment of the acquisition price should I think be debited to the Saniya Department and all revenues accruing thereform credited to it. In course of time it will become a very valuable property and the Saniya Department will be able to recover the capital expenditure now involved out of the rental of the land, which will presumably be taken up for building purposes by the various Government Departments concerned. For the period of the war it is unneces sary to raise the question of charging the Military Departments now occupying the land any rent therefor. [c) In the case of the larger holdings such as those of the Zuhair and Mandil families, the Fahad al Sadun family, Agha Jafar and a few others it might be feasible and possibly desirable to exchange the land acquired for correspond ing portions of the less manageable Saniyah properties in the Basrah Sanjaq, as has been proposed above in the case of the Waqf holdings, instead of making payment in cash. It view of the fact that in the futute the Saniyah Department will presumably be called upon to manage the extensive areas that will be brought under cultivation in connection with future irrigation schemes, I think it is very desirable that it should take the present opportunity of casting off a number of its less cohesive holdings on the Shatt al Arab, which are a source of more trouble than profit.

We are empowered by our military occupation of Mesopotamia to acquire temporarily any area required for military purposes, but Commander-in-Chief is advised that acquisition of permanent rights would only be justified by negotia tion with the owners. So long as temporary occupation continues, however, this should not be attempted. The question as to what land may have to be taken for public purposes and the compensation to be paid will be carefully considered should it be ultimately decided to annex Basrah but the acquisition at the present time of permanent rights, as proposed by you, seems premature and might create difficulty at a later period.
