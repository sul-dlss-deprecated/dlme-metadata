The B.B.J# broadcasts have incidentally again brought into prominence the manager of the Town electric supply who, as reported in last month’s diary, was accused of adjusting the supply of electricity so that German broadcasts could not be heard. He denied this accusation and announced his intention of closing down the Town electric supply altogether. That he has not yet carried out this threat is new said to be due to the commencement of B.B.C. broadcasts. COMMJNIDaTIOKS . Work on repairs to the Bu^hire section of the Bushire-bhiraz road has been started. It seems improbable however, that the repairs will have any lasting effect and, in at lea^t two instances, culverts supported by iron girders only preserved their ferrous content by the fortunate occurrence of a quarrel, between the road contractors and the municipality, over the division of the iron girders which they had proposed to remove# c*n article published in a Tehran journal, and quoted by the J.B.O. in their first broadcast, on the subject of the construction of a railway from Bushire to bhiraz, caused some surprise in Bushire, where nothing had previously been heard of the project.

II# LOCAL GOVERNMENT . 135 , The new Governor Agha Mir Zahir Humayun arrived at B u shire cn November 26th. The customary formal cells were exchanged without incident, and it is hoped, that relations between the Governorate and Consulate will continue on t he same friendly footing as they did in the time of his predecessor, who, whatever his failings, was at least super- -fi cl ally helpful. 136. A new order, requiring the strict observance of Fridays as a public holiday, has caused surprise. The order, which appears to be general and not merely local, is being rigidly enforced by the police and municipal farashes. 137. On the 20 th November a committee of Inspectors arrived from Tehran to carry out the annual inspection of local Government Offices. Almost their first act was to arrest all garage end motor transport owners for offering brioes. A few days later the director and two members of the Economic Department were arrested for accepting bribes and falsification of accounts and the transport proprietors re le ased. 138. The/2 * 138. 139. 140. 141. 142. 143 . (T'S) The Bushire Court of First Instance has been reduced to the grade of small Causes Court. This ^ reduction has arcused considerable discontent among the local merchants who will now nave to refer all cases involving amounts of more than Rials 5,000. to Shiraz for settlement. Representations have been made to Tehran to reinstate the Court as a Court of First Instance. A public quarrel between an inspector of Customs and the Director of the Town .Electric Company reached an amusing climax with the former accusing the latter of receiving payments from the Consulate in return for an agreement to reduce the supply of electric current at times when Germany broadcasts. Thus making it impossible for the townspeople to hear German news bulletins. III. MILITARY. The military authorities are still examining passengers arriving from Bahrain in the hope of obtaining further details regarding the air raid by Italian planes in October. Sartip Amidi accompanied by Sarhang Yazdan Mehr a and/party of staff officers carried out an inspection of the Bushire garrison during the month. On 25th November a large party of conscripts was sent to Kaki ( about 65 miles south east of Bushire) where it is intended to establish a new military garrison which ^ will reinforce the detachment of Road Guards already stationed there. IV. MAVY. Sarwan Amidi, Officer in Charge of the Naval Bureau at Bushire wae recalled to Tehran at the end of October.

Contrary to expectations the local authorities have not yet asked for the navigational lights to be re- -moved from the Consulate flagstaff. V. MOVEMKETTS OP ffOR&amp;IGM)RS . Mr.Shiros Ohanesti Babenderoc, Assistant Manager in Tehran, of the Japanese steamship line M Kitsui rt came to Bushire on 9th November and left again on 13th November after supervising the shipment of 500 cases of opium# Two Yugo-Slsv engineers, Messers Arnol and Branc Rade are reported to be working on the Shahbankareh dam. A party of four Czecho Slovakians reported to be employees of the Iranian Government Sugar Rectory at Shiraz visited Bushire on the 20th November. They were observed taking photographs of the British Consulate, fcnd Naval Bureau and other Government buildings but apparently did not arouse the s^pecial interest of the police. V1 • T RAPS AND DSYELQBMSNT . The American steamship line Isbrandtsen Mollar has opened a sub-agency at Bushire under the management of a local merchant Mirza Ehslil Dashti. Daring the past two months there have been small but unusual shipments of cargo, mainly linseed, from Bushire to Basra and Bagdad# In addition, on the 20th November a. consignment of 783 bales of paper originally landed in Bushire by Lloyd Trestino vessel INDIA on 14th December 1939 consigned to S.H.Golshani was reshipped to Bagdad rt to order’*/tv 7 151. 152. 153. 154. The continued Greek successes against the Italians have avvakened a new interest in the progress of the war. Ignorance of the towns in Greece and Albania however tends to give people a very confused impression of what is happening. MI S GE liLAEQj; CHS . On 20th November the Bushire Po s t Office stated that they had received instructions from Tehran to accept and deliver mails from Bahrain. Only one mail was however delivered and by the end of the month they were again detaining mails and denying that any had been received. There is a very welcome rumour that the Iranian Government have allotted Rials 700,000 for repairs to tne Buslii re-Shiraz road across the Mashileh. it is also reported that part of the Bushire-lingeh road is to be realigned and a branch road constructed from Khormuj to Piruzabad. sd/~ A.C.Stewsrt Secretary to the Political Resident m the Persian G u lf.

MOVEMENTS ♦ British Officials ♦ 96. Nil. II. LOCAL GOVERNMENT. 97 # The Governor, AQ,ai Hasan Farzaneh, returned to Bushire on 4th Septeraber from Tehran, where, it is believed he had been ohiefly occupied in trying to arrange a transfer from Bushire to a more salubrious climate'. Apparently he was successful for on 24th September he left again for Tehran on transfer to a Governorate in Mazanderan. His successor has not yet been appointed. The Governor General for Fars however informed His Majesty’s Consul at a recent meeting that in view of the presence of the Residency at Bushire, (it is noteworthy that he used the tens 'Residency” not 'Consulate General'), he considered it necessary to have a Governor with European experience at Bushire and stated that he hoped the appointment would be filled by a nominee of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 98. As an economy measure the two Deputy Governorships of Tangistan and Kangun have been abolished. Tangiatan being placed under the Jurisdiction of the Governor of Borasjun and Kangun under the road-guard authorities, it is predicted that the transfer in jurisdiction will be detrimental to the interests of the inhabitants of these two districts. 111.

On 9th September Mr. Paul Audrevitch Sebekov, Secretary to the Russian Embassy in Tehran and Mr# Alexandre Autipov, Russian Trade Representative arrived at Bushire from Ahwaz. They stayed at &amp;azeruni *8 rest house and left again on the next day after calling on the Oovernor and inspecting the premises of the old Russian Consulate# They warned the caretaker that a representative from the Russian Embassy in Tehran would shortly be sent down to supervise the repairs which are being carried out to the Consulate buildings. VI. TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT . Some 3000 bags of sugar were passed through the customs during the month* the greater part being un loaded from one ship* of the Java Pacific Line, which was anchored off Bushire for almost a week unloading. All the sugar is being despatched up country to Tehran; its ultimate destination however remains unknown# Apart from this and the export of dates very little business was done. on the 30th September the Iranian Government fishing vessels 'Rashgoo' and »Sang-i~Sar» arrived at Bushire# It is understood that the object of their visit is to carry out a test to discover whether the quantity of fish available off Bushire is sufficient to justify the establishment of a cannery in the Town# The catch has not so far been good but this is possibly due to the _ / fact/ XII f y / U 1940 ’ j t-;V) ■..iiS* 1 '''' fact that one of the vessels almost immediately ran aground* The question of establishing a cannery at Bushire was first raised in 1937 but at the time, in view of other considerations, was allowed to lapse • VII.

There were again several hold-ups on the Bushire- Shiraz road during the month and in addition there were a number of isolated acts of robbery in villages scattered throughout the district. Though the Authorities are doing their best to suppress the lawless elements responsible it is feared that until something is done to relieve the poverty and distress, which is almost universal, they will meet with little success, in spite of the very stern example they make of all prisoners they areable to capture. All Ismail the Dashti outlaw who had for some time been holding out against the combined efforts of Military and road-guard authorities has now accepted XI. an amnesty and returned to his village having surrendered a number of rifles and S.A.A. it is generally believed however that he has a quantity of arms and ammunition in reserve for future emergencies.

On 30th September the Tehran Radio Station broadcast the news that the Iranian Government had delegated representatives to Berlin to arrange a trade treaty between the two countries, in Bushire it is considered that* since the attitude of Russia towards the tripartite treaty between Germany, Italy and Japan remains unknown, the move is injudicious. XIII. Q.UARAHTINE . * Quarantine restrictions on ships arriving from India were continued throughout the month. A notice was also circulated about 20th September to the effect that the same restrictions should be brought into force against ships arriving from Basra. This was later found to be a mistake and the order cancelled. XIV . MISCELLANEOUS . • It is understood in Bushire that the wreck of the old Persian gunboat ,, PerBepolis ,, which has for many years been lying aground off the customs jetty, slowly decaying, has been sold as scrap iron to am Ispahan merchant for a sum of^Tomans 3,000/-. -t—Os, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

According to figures quoted by the Governor no less than 500 persons went away for the month of August alone. Though improved communications are undoubtedly a contributory cause for this exodus it is probable that the chief reason is the general fall off in trade which, owing to the considerably reduced number of foreign ships calling at Bushire, has left persons of all clas es who were formerly connected with the customs and shipping trade without work. 83. Once again at the end of the month the Bushire post office refused to deliver Bahrain mail. On this occasion they firmly denied having received any, when it became impossible for them to maintain this attitude however they admitted the receipt of mail but stated that it was being held up under instructions from Tehran and regretted they were unable to release it until they received fresh instructions. It is not known why the Iranian Postal Authorities have raised this old question, pending its settlement however, arrangements have been made to despatch official mail from Bahrain to Basra where it can be posted in the normal way. 84. Mail steamers travelling from Iraq to India continue to carry a full quota of passengers including passengers of all nationalities endeavouring to escape from the Hear East before the war zone spreads to their homes. Early in the month the newly app inted First Secretary to the Iranian Legation in Washington travelled as a passenger in one of the B.I. boats to Bombay en route to take up his appointment. ;V 85* iiarl^ in the month cergo, which had been lying at j\ Bushire for some months awaiting shipment to Italy, was returned to Northern Iren, presumably for export to Europe via Bandar Pahlsvi and Russia# The following consignments were returned in this way *- Towards the end of the month it was observed that a number of snip per a who had previously handled cargo destined for Italy were sending fairly neavy consignments of the same type of cargo addressed to merchants in Iraq# 86 .

British air succesbea and Hitler’s apparent failure to carry out his threatened invasion of England have had e marked effect on public opinion and a number of persons who, after the defection of Prance# had begun to fear that all was over now xm view the situation more cheerfully. The withdrawal of British troops from bomaliland attracted surprisingly little attention and people are now settling down to the expectation of s long war. VIII .

IX. HhAXTH . 93* Throughout the month quarantine restrictions have been imposed on all ships arriving at Bushire from India the effective control of these restrictions has however been somewhat impaired by the refusal of the doctor, specially sent from Tehran, to undertake his duties as quarantine Officer. He has been suspended from duty and is still at 'Bushire doing nothing. X. CaiDITIOH OF Til* HI^T^HIATO, PASHTI ACT TAHGI^TAH. 94. sporadic acts of banditry occurred again in Dashti and Tangi- stan. On the whole however the road guards appeared to have the situation in hand and a number of arrests have been effected. In the fighting which took place however the road guards met with several casualties. Ali Ismail who as was reported in the Diary for July had been successfully withstanding the efforts of the military authorities to capture him has now accepted a safe conduct and return to hie village. It seems unlikely however that he will be/*-4- be ■llov.ed to live there in peace for very long. XI .jf03,UGH AIH#A.Y3. 95. Nil. Sd. A.C.Stewart.

The hot weather appears to have had a dampening effect on local interest in the war and there has been no sign of either pro or anti British feeling* There are however many signs of increasing hostility towards the Government, for whose short-comings the British are to some extent held responsible. It being said that the Government, whose exactions and stupidity is causing hardship and poverty throughout the country, acts only on tU orders of the Shah, and as the Shah was placed in power by the British the British are responsible for his misgovernment. While this involved method of reasoning, which may possibly be the result of German propaganda, is not seriously effecting the feelings of Bushiri* s towards the British, at the same time there can | be no doubt as to the personal unpopularity of the Shah, and it seems likely that any power which succeeded in upsetting his authority would gain the sympathy of tribes in the Southern Provinces* VIII.

Herr Carl Izentrager, a German who was recently discharged from the service of the bushire Cotton Mill, was sent to Shiraz, by the Bushire Tolice authorities at the beginning of the month.

The Publicity Officer, Bahrain, Captain R.D.Metcalfe, also visited Bushire at the same time and the discussions which took place were most useful. One of the most striking features of Professor Rushbrook Williams* visit was the geniality of the local officials who had clearly been warned of his arrival and who, some days before, ejecting him to arrive by sea, requested His Majesty*s Consul to send one of the Consulate farrashes to the Customs premises in order that all arrangements could be made in advance for his passage through the Customs with the minimum of delay. A further example of goodwill was given by the Governor, who had been invited to dinner at the Residency in order to meet Professor Rushbrook Wilbams, and who insisted upon arranging a personally conducted tour of the Bushire cotton mill the next day, a tour which proved most interesting. Professor Rushbrook Williams left Bushire by Air France for Basra on the 13th May. 38. Mr. C.R.Latimer, I.C.B., His Majesty’s vice Consul, Bushire, accompanied by Mr. R.G.Daubeny, under Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian / Gulf- 2 - Gulf, left for Shiraz en route for Tehran on 16th May: they returned to Bushire on the 26th* Local Gorermient * Tne offices of the Police, Military and Revenue Departments were inspected during the month by senior officials from Tehran and Shiraz. All the inspec tions are said to have passed off without unusual comment* A special budget grant of Rials 170,000 has been allotted to the Bushire Municipality for the construction of a Rest House to accommodate senior officials passing through Bushire on tour. A site has been selected on the sea front and work on the building has commenced. When completed the Rest House will provide accommodation for four persons. Military . A hundred and twenty conscripts were enrolled during the month, and of these twenty were sent to Shiraz and one hundred retained at Bushire to replace a similar number of conscripts who were discharged after completing their period of service. A further batch of eighty old conscripts were recalled to undergo a short refresher course. Twenty five of these have been sent to Khorramshahr and the remainder are undergoing their training at Bushire. During the month a ruteour, not widespread, but nevertheless interesting, was circulated to the effect that British troops, at the request of the Iranian Government, had occupied the Island of Qishm. This is the second ruiaour of occupation by British troops within the past few months and though / both-3- 44. 45. 46. 47. both, rumours were shortlived it is perhaps an indication of the channels to which memories of the last war are turning peoples thoughts. IV. Naval . At the beginning of the month Darya Bar bayendor paid a flying visit to Bushire* it is thought that the purpose of his visit was to discuss with the Governor the steps to be taken by Iranian officials in the event of more Danish or Norwegian ships putting into Iranian ports for shelter. Though rumours were current that a Dutch ship had also taken shelter at the port of Lewar, they later proved to be without foundation. it is stated that Sarhang Bayendor, who only a short time after his promotion was recalled in dis grace to Tehran, has been placed on the half pay list and is likely to be returned to the Army. V. Movements of foreigners . The two Russian Trade Agents who up to the end of the last month were expected to reach Bushire almost immediately appear to have postponed their arrival indefinitely. Local opinion connects their non-arrival with the persistent rumours which state that the Russo-iranian trade pact has come to nothing, une of the reasons which has beaa advanced for the apparent failure of this trade pact is that a number of Russians were recently supposed to have made an attempt on the life of the Shah. At the beginning of the month a member of the Residency Staff, ifaile travelling from Ahorramshahr to Bushire, met on board the mail steamer a Danish / businessbusiness man named Herr kelson who was travelling with his Secretary Herr Muller♦ kelson stated that for the past two years he had acted as the representative of all the important Danish industrial firms dealing with Iran and that as the representative of a Danish firm he had signed the contract for the construction of the fish cannery at Bandar Abbas and also another contract for N&lt;rrH\ building a factory in Mast Iran* he stated that the Iranian Government had given the Danish firm an advance on account of the latter factory which had been guaranteed by a Danish Bank. As the guarantee was now worthless and as, since the invasion of Denmark, he had no hope of ever being able to complete his contract, he feared that the Iranian Government would compel him to hand over all the money he held in Iran on behalf of other Danish firms. He further stated that he had heard from Danes in Tehran that the Danish Charge d f Affaires held strongly pro-German sympathies and that he was likely to get little assistance from him. For this reason while in Bagdad he had approached the British Consul and asked without success for British protection. The statements of Herr nelson in regard to the sympathies of the Danish Charge d*Affaires are, however, understood to be entirely without foundation. Some time later a British subject informed His Majesty’s Consul, that while travelling from Jask to Bushire he met two Danes / whosewhose names he could not remember who, he claimed, were making very adverse comments about the lack of assistance offered to Denmark by the British Government, it is possible that these two Danes may have been tierr Kelson and muller returning to Basra from Bandar Abbas. VI. Trade and Developments . 48. The electric plant which it was reported in last months diary had been ordered by the Bushire Municipality arrived in Bushire this month, it proved on arrival to be merely a secondhand plant purchased in Tehran and it has been explained that owing to the possibility of delay in receiving a new plant from Germany the Municipality has had to postpone its purchase until more favourable times. Though it was reported some weeks ago that the plant ordered by the Bushire CJottom Mill was in Iran it has not yet arrived at Bushire. The Mill officials however are still optimistic and expect to receive it quite soon. VII. Public Opinion . 49. The events of the past month have somewhat naturally had a depressing effect on public opinion, un the whole, however, it can be said that though confidence has been shaken in the power of the Allies to defeat Germany, nevertheless the memory of the manner in which the Allies recovered from an almost equally grave position at the beginning of the last war is having a steadying effect and people are still reserving judgment. There has been no noticeable change in the attitude of local /officialsofficials, most of whom still show sympathy with the Allied cause, and on occasions when they meet members of the Consulate, at least, they express confidence in the ultimate victory of the Allies* VIII* Broadcasting * Arrangements are being made to purchase and instal in public places two Kadio receiving sets in order that the town people may have an opportunity to listen in to the Tehran broadcasts* It is reported in Bushire that the German Legation in Tehran has lodged a protest with the Ministry of the interior against the pro-British bias of the Tehran news bulletins* I IX.

The military authorities have, however, effected a number of arrests, and at the end of the month the situation was reported to be quieter. To a certain extent the disturbed state of affairs seems to have been caused by the Governor of Dashti who was recently called to Bushire to answer a number of complaints made against him for refusing to pay debts he had incurred* During the enquiry it transpired that the Governor had not had any pay for over a year and was in consequence unable to meet his creditors 1 demands*At the beginning of the month two or three lorries travelling from Shiraz to Bushire were held up by bandits at a place about forty miles outside Shiraz* for Secretary to the ioli tical Kesident in the Persian Gulf* British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the 3rd June, 1940.INDEXED DISTRIBUTION a &amp; 53 tt.. 1.

I. MOVEMENTS . British Officials . On the 29th April the Hon 1 hie Lieut.-Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Majesty's Consul-General, Bushire, accompanied by his under Secretary, left Bushire for Khorram shahr• Mr. C.R.Latimer, I.C.S., His Majesty's Vice Consul, Bushire, returned to Bushire on the 22nd April after completing a tour of the Persian Gulf. 11 • LOCAL governme nt. &amp; meeting of the Municipal Committee held under the presidency of the Governor of Bushire it was resolved to submit a report to the Central Government embodying the following suggestions (a) The restrictions on the sale of Government lands which at the moment can only be sold for agricul tural purposes should be relaxed in order to local enable^/merchants to Jmrchase land for building purposes. (b) The authority under vfhich certain of the smaller ports in the Persian Gulf are enabled to export Iranian produce up to a value of Rials 1000/- in exchange for foreign imports of the same value without the necessity of obtain ing import and export permits should be extended to Bushire. /(c)2 - (c) That special facilities should he afforded at Bushire for the issue of import permits without the necessity of referring every application to Tehran. At the conclusion of the meeting the Governor assured those present that he had no doubt that the Central Govern ment would accept all the proposals without qualification. His optimism is not shared by the merchants. IU. MILITARY . 20o A further large batch of recruits was conscripted during the month and sent to Shiraz. It is believed locally however that the Recruiting Officer was on this occasion more than usually amenable to bribery and that after pocketing about Tomans 1000/- he issued some 200 exemption pap er s • IV. KAVAL . 21. The recent promotions of Sarhang Bayendor and lawar Bayendor to the ranks of Darya Dar ^Rear Admiral) and Sarhang (Colonel) respectively have made it possible that at some time in the future the Persian H&amp;vy may have two officers serving in the Gulf senior in rank to the Senior IT aval Officer, Persian Gulf. Though it is unlikely that there will be any immediate occasion of their meeting it is possible that this position may cause difficulties in the future. 22. At the beginning of April the Persian ITavy carried out their annual exercises and after firing a few practice rounds off Bushire the whole fleet came in to the inner anchorage where, with the exception of the gunboat ,, Chahbaaz ,, , they remained for two days. The ,, Chahbaaz ,, / left-3- V. 23* left again almost immediately for Bandar bhahpur in order, it was stated, to keep an eye on the German ships lying there. Uaib Sarhang Zalli until recently Officer in Charge of the Naval Bureau at Bushire has left Bushire on transfer to Bandar bhahpur, where he will take over charge as Port Director. MOVSITiNTS OP F0KBIG5BRS * 3?or some weeks now workmen have been actively painting and repairing the old Russian Consulate in Bushire. This has given rise to a whole crop of rumours which culminated towards the end of the month in the statement that the Consulate was once again to he occupied by two Trade representatives who were to be safely installed in their new post by a Consul. The Consul, rumour stated, would stay only a short time in Bushire thereafter going to Ahwaz where he would establish his headquarters. The party, though expected daily, had not arrived at the time of writing this .report • On the 11th April Mr. Andrew Green Lynch, be eretary of the united States Legation at Tehran, accompanied by his wife, arrived at Bushire for a brief visit. Though the movement of travellers through Borazjun was, at the time, supposed to be restricted, owing to an outbreak of smallpox, Mr. lynch stated that he experienced no difficulty in passing through and indeed remained unaware that any form of quarantine had been imposed on the town. On the 25th April the Japanese Military Attach® at Tehran, accompanied by a young Japanese student named Jikimuto Nakusa, arrived at Bushire. They left again / early26. -4- early the next morning after a stay of only a few hours 0 This made the fourth diplomatic party to visit Bushire in the short space of six weeks and though in all cases their activities whilst in Bushire have Been harmless enough it is impossible not to attach a certain amount of suspicion to the visits of the German and Japanese Military Attaches both of whoEJ stayed only a few hours at night in Bushire. The journey from Shiraz to Bushire is unpleasant enough to render it unlikely that anyone would come to Bushire merely to stay the night and leave again before dawn the next day unless they had some business to perform between Bushire and Shiraz. So far however it has not been possible to attach special significance to any of their actions. During the last week of April a report was received in Bushire that a Danish ship had put in at the port of Daiyar, about 100 miles south of Bushire, to avoid capture by British sloops. According to reports since received from Bahrain however it transpires that this was the tanker SLEATTORA MAEKSK - the Gaptain of which acting on instructions from his owners had put into the nearest neutral port and after some trouble with the crew had crossed over to Bahrain from where the ship has since been sent under naval escort to Karachi. The news of the tanker*s arrival in Daiyar was not received in Bushire until some days after it had left again and as late as 29th April the Governor in conversation with His Majesty*s Consul informed him that the ship was still in Daiyar adding that the IT' / Captainc. &gt; ‘ Captain who was experiencing some difficulty with the crew wished to take shelter at Bandar Shahpur and that he had telegraphed to Tehran for orders. Whilst the Governor may have made this statement with the deliber ate intention to mislead, he left His Majesty’s Consul with the impression that he was genuinely unaware that the ship had left Baiyar some days before. 27. On the 1st April Messrs. Meter Jens Kofat, a Bane, and Hans utto Hater, v/ith Madam Hater, Swiss nationals, arrived at Bushire by air and left almost immediately for Shiraz. Both Kofat and Hater are believed to be engineers in the employ of the Persian Government. 28. Four Italian and one German engineer employed on the construction of the Shahbankareh dam across the Shahpur river at Saadabad paid a brief visit to Bushire during the month to purchase supplies, one of them, Mr. Petra Capuchi, stated that the dam would be finished in a few months 1 time and that it would be formally opened by H.M. the Shah. YL. TRADE AND BBVSLOBlEKTS . 29. nothing further has been heard of the proposals to divert all trade in the Southern Ports to the railway via Bandar Shahpur. The Bushire police however have recently demanded undertakings from all forwarding agents and taxi drivers that they would not carry goods or passengers for towns beyond Q,um or other places served by the railway, it is also rumoured that the Central Government have appropriated the sum of about £ 100 , 000 /- for the construction of offices and warehouses at Bandar Shahpur. if this should prove / corrects -5- correct it would appear that the Government have not entirely given up hope of putting into effect their original proposals . 30* English experts employed by the Bushire Cotton and Ginning Mill report that the mill is shortly expecting to receive a new generating plant from Germany, via Russia. The mill already owns two engines of English manufacture and they give two reasons which they believe lead the Directors of the mill to place the order for the new engine in Germany. Firstly through faulty installation and lack of attention the two British made engines already installed at the mill are giving a great deal of trouble and though new parts have been ordered fron the British firm Mirlees &amp; Co. they have been told that owing to other activities delivery cannot be guaranteed. Secondly owing to the fact that the German engine can be bought through the German Trade Agent in Tehran and paid for in Rials the mill is saved the trouble and expense „ . important oi purchasing import permits and, more^iiqpjwnt, foreign exchange, it is claimed that in spite of the heavy transport charges for importation overland it is cheaper to buy from Germany paying in Rials than it would be to buy from England and after importing by sea pay in Sterling. 31* it is understood that the Bushire Municipality has also placed an order for the importation of a German made generating plant for the use of the town electricity and ice company. / YIIVII. PUBLIC OPIHIOH 32. Reactions to the German invasion of Borway« Germany's invasion of Denmark and Borway has awakened tremendous interest amongst all classes in Bushire and even the most pro-German elements appear to have been greatly shocked at the suddenness of the onslaught^#. As the earlier announcements of naval Germany *s/losses were received however this feeling of shock turned to one of keen expectancy and both pro-German and pro-Allied elements eagerly awaited news of far reaching land operations. Unfortunately however the British statements of progress have been somewhat vague and indefinite and though opinion is fairly equally divided the more emphatic terms in which the German news is announced added to its backing by the Italian news is tending to strengthen the opinion that the move has been another success for the Germans. On the whole however it may be said that opinion is largely governed by the wishes of the individual and the officials, who appear to be somewhat fearful that in the event of a German victory Russian influence would upset the present Government (with a consequent loss of employment for them), remain fairly optimistic about Allied progress. On the other hand merchants, who apparent ly see more benefit to themselves from a German victory and who are in consequence more pro-German in their sympathies, are inclined to believe that the Allies have suffered a further setback. / VIIIVIII. BROADCASTING. 33. Bushire listeners still sho?/ little interest ^ in the Delhi broadcasts, indeed the reception on the medium wave band is so bad at Bushire that they cannot be blamed for preferring the Berlin broadcasts which are received with great clarity and ease. 34. The opening of the Broadcasting Station at Tehran on the 14th April awakened tremendous interest in Bushire arid for once the guests flocked eagerly to a public reception which the Governor held at the Saadat School in order to listen to the Prime Ministers speech. 35. Whether or not it is merely the appeal of something new, it is early to decide, certainly however,for the moment,the Tehran news is greatly appreciated and as it quite impartially gives extracts from both the German and British news announcements, it is possible that in detracting attention from the Berlin broad casts it will serve in some measure to offset the advantage the Germans have until recently gained by their more frequent and more easily obtainable programmes. IX. HEALTH . 36. The outbreak of smallpox reported from Borazjun at the end of last month has died down.

The new Department will be in the charge of Agha • Husain Arjmand who recently arrived from Tehran. 3® Education. Dr. Siddiq A*slam. Principal of the Tehran University and Dr. £aid Hafisi, poet and historian, arrived in Bushire on March 27th and gave a series of lectures on Education and the Art of Public Speaking® Whilst in Bushire they also carried out an inspection of the local schools which convinced them of the inadequacy of the Education Department *s / budget4 0 - 2 ‘ budget allotment o lliey left Bushire promising to represent the matter to the Minister for Education witn ^ a view to obtaining an increase in the next year *2 allotment• On the 15th March, on the occasion of the Anniver sary of the Shah’s birthday. His Majesty’s Consul and members of the British community at Bushire were invited to dinner at the Governorate« About 100 other guests, mainly officials and their wives, were present and after dinner the Europeans were invited to dance 0 A few officials also took part in the dancing* The space was however limited and the majority appeared ielieved to be able to excuse themselves on these grounds* Earlier in the evening the Governor had introduced an innovation by inviting members of the clerical estab lishment of the Consulate-General to tea® Hauroz Y/as celebrated in the usual manner on the 21st March* During the call of His Majesty’s Consul, the conversation turned principally on the subject of the recently initialled Kusso-lranian trade pact and the Governor, who together with many other officials appears to be extremely anxious about Russia’s next move now that the war with Finland is finished, expressed the view that the sole benefit which Iran would gain from this pact would be derived from the re-opening of the German market by means of the ship ment of goods in transit across Russia* Though the yC. Governor is very pro-British in his opinions at the same time he firmly believes that whether the British are to be blamed or not, the war with Germany has until recently done great harm to Iran by closing / one w-3- o k : /fl o o i n a n i w i I Both tEFTrOvernor 1 s one of its most profitable markets# sentiments and opinions appear to be shared by a numbei . of the more influential merchants* IIIo MILITARY. \ •a 6» Towards the end of the month the Military Authorities received fresh instructions from Shira^ cancelling their previous orders (reported in the February Diary) to clear the ground within a 1000 yards each side of the barracks. Ho explanation was given. It is interesting to observe however that amongst the many rumours which purported to account for the earlier instructions was one that the ground was to be cleared to make room for a camp which would shelter a ‘British expeditionary force in case of a Russian attack on Iran. Memories of the last v/ar during which high rates of compensation were paid for damage done when clearing the ground for British troops seemed to make this a not altogether unwelcome rumour. 7. During the month 93C conscripts were recruited: of these 650 were sent to Shiraz and 280 retained to undergo training at Bushire . A similar number of recruits who have completed their period of conscript service vail be disbanded. TV# MOVEME NT S OF F0KBIG2TBRS . 8* On the 9th of March the German Military Attach^ who was accompanied by his sister and one of the Secretaries to the German legation at Tehran arrived at Bushire from Shiraz. The party arrived late at night and left again early the next morning after staying only a few hours in Bushire e So far as can be ascertained they met hobody in Bushire and though it was at first believed uXX&amp;t. they had halted for a few hours on the v^ay back to / ShirazShiran at Chaga&amp;ak, Wassmuas 1 old home, this has now proved to be incorrect* i. The visit of the German Military Attach^ coincided v.itu y a visit paid by the Italian Minister in Tehran who was accompanied by his daughter and the wife of the Italian ITaval Attach^* This party had no contact with anybody outside the British Consulate where they stayed until they returned to Shiraz two day's later* Immediately on his arrival the Minister remarked that the German Military Attach^ was following close behind him, adding that he had no idea what his purpose was in visiting Bushire. During the Minister’s visit it v/as announced on the wireless that the British Government had decided to hold up ^ shipments of German coal to Italy' and the Minister who, perhaps somewhat naturally under the circumstances, appealed to hold extremely r pro-British views, expressed anxiety T lest this decision should have an adverse effect on public opinion ; in Italy which, he stated, definitely favoured the allied cause# A similar opinion, though somewhat more qualified, was also expressed by the commander of an Italian merchant man which called recently at Bushire who had much to say that was of interest* 10# He was a former Austrian subject, and though the crew v/ere characteristically Italian he shared neither their appearance nor their sympathies* He looked forward to the day when a Balkan group under revived Austrian leadership would prevent German or Italian penetration but was not ^ very clear how the warring Balkan elements,(whose fiesi- parous tendency he described in detail), were to achieve either cohesion or combination* H„ He said that it v/as a fact that the country in general, / the-5- the Papacy arid Royal Pamily 'were strongly' opposed to entering ^ the v/ar against the Allies, hut considered that this would count for nothing if Mussolini gave the order to fight on the other side * He could see nothing in essence to choose between Bolshevism Nazism or Fascism and thought that once the people lost their liberty the label mattered little . Just as Hitler had surprised everyone by his volte face , (though no one who studied his practice as opposed to his theory need have been taken unawares), so would Mussolini if he found his hand forced by his Axis partner* V. TRAPS AND DBVSLOPMBNTfil a 12* On the 4th March Agha Pr. Kia and Agha Muhammadabadi who are respectively Pirectcr General and Inspector General of the Iranian Customs Administration arrived at Bushire from Bandar Shahpur• They stated that whilst at Bandar Sh&amp;hpur they had made a thorough examination of the recent proposals of the Iranian Government to divert all trade from the Gulf Ports to Bandar Shahpur and had found that though it was moat desirable to ship as much merchandize as possible through Bandar Shahpur in order that the railway may be used to the fullest possible extent, nevertheless, until the facilities } for handling cargo at Bandar Shahpur were much improved, it J would be impossible to close down other Gulf Ports* They r added that at the moment the facilities available at Bushire were far in advance of anything Bandar Shahpur could offer It is believed hov/ever that the Khorrarashahr Customs Budget allotment has already been halved in order to make increased funds available for Bandar Shahpur* Before leaving Bushire Pr, Kia ordered that a small house which stands close to the Customs premises should be converted into a godown* VI* BRO.APCASTING , / 13, -t*- *13» 14 o 15. 16.

Whilst talking on the subject of broadcasts in Iranian the Governor of Buahire recently remarked to His Majesty’s Consul that in his opinion the British Broad casts were not to be compared with the German who seemed to be well informed on Iranian affairs and who confined their announcements to short and pithy statements which, whether true or not, were much more interesting to listen to than the British announcements which seemed mainly to be on the subject of the opinions expressed the day before in London by politicians who were un known to the majority of the Iranian listeners. As an example of the manner in which Germany kept herself informed of Iranian affairs he stated that the other day he had been particularly impressed to hear a Berlin announcer use newly coined v/ords in regard to the general introduction of which he had only that morning received intimation from Tehran. Bushire listeners have expressed satisfaction that Delhi has at last begun to broadcast in Iranian Persian^ as well as Labuli Persian. On the whole, however, they still seem to prefer the German nev/So HEALTH o A serious outbreak of smallpox was reported from -tfOxazjan at tne end of the month. Though no cases have yet been reported in Bushire the Health authorities have ordered that all persons in the town should be vaccinated and are making ready to deal with the epidemic should it spread.

On 1st February, Aqai Sami’i Zadeh, Assistant Director of Agriculture, Shiraz, arrived at Bushire. After meeting the Governor he left again almost immediately on a tour of inspec tion of the districts. On his return to Bushire he gave a series of lectures at one of which he stated that Bushire, from the point of view of trade, was dead and that for their future prosperity the people must depend on agriculture. With the introduction of modern agricultural methods and appliances, he assured his audience, there was no reason why Bushire should not once again become a prosperous and wealthy town especially now that work had commenced on the construction of a new dam across the river Shapur which should ensure that a plentiful supply of water for irrigation purposes will always be available. 2. On the 14th February, Aqai Bahooshi, the new Manager of the National Bank of Iran, Bushire, arrived and took over from Mr. Baladi. 3. On the 17th February, a Committee of Inspectors under the presidency of Lieut.-Colonel Gudarzi, Mecruiting Officer, Shiraz, arrived at Bushire to carry out the final examination of a number of conscripts who, on the grounds of physical incapa city, had been exempted from military service during the past three years.

The local authorities who viewed him with some suspicion are keeping a close watch on his move ments. V. Russian Interests Extensive repairs have recently been carried out to the old Russian Consulc te in Bushire and there are local rumours that a Russian Consul will again be appointed to Bushire in the near future. 16. HEALTH OF THE TOWS There were a few cases of influenza and pneumonia during the month; in the main however, the general state of health continued to be good and there was a further decrease in the number of cases of malaria. 17.

C-JhEB^UTIOH Off THE COUP D*ETAT On the 23rd Pehruary the Military Garrison held a ceremonial parade in order to mark the 19th Anniversary of the Coup d'Etat. In addition to the Garrison, boy scouts and school boys took part in the parade which concluded with a march past the Shah’s photo graph. During the parade local officials and prominent merchants and traders were provided with refreshments and in the evening the officers of the Garrison gave a dinner party to which they invited some 80 guests. 21. TEIE GRAPH TRAIEIEG CLASS At a meeting held under the presidency of the Director of Posts and Telegraphs it was announced that the Government had sanctioned a scheme for the training of a limited number of school students as telegraphists. In conformity with this scheme six students have been selected to attend special classes. During the period of this training they will be paid Rials 80/- per men sem, and when they have passed their final examination will be offered employment with the Posts and Telegraphs Department. 22. MILITARY Orders have recently been issued that all ground within 1000 yards each side of the Military Barracks at Bushire must be cleared of trees, houses, walls and other obstructions. There is much speculation in Bushire as to the necessity for this clear ance, and amongst other current rumours it is stated that the authorities propose to construct a military aerodrome in the vicinity of the barracks. 23. COHSCRIPTIQH Some 400 conscripts have been notified that they should report themselves for military service before the end of March.4 24. AMALGAMATION OF THE RO.AD CtIJARD ffQHCB W ITH THil MX LIP ART . .y^J Reference paragraph No.37 of diary for March 1939. On 20th February a party of conscripts was posted for service with the Hoad Guards Department. These are the first conscripts to be affected by the new scheme for the amalgamation of the Road Guards and Military Departments. They have all com pleted 8 months training in the military barracks and will serve the remainder of their period of conscription with the rtoad Guards, It is hoped that by insisting that all future conscripts serve two-thirds of their time with the Road Guards it will eventually be possible to disband entirely the old units which have, through the abuse of their authority, caused considerable dissatisiaction amongst the people® 25. THANSIQRT Off IRANIAN IMPORTS AND EXPORTS VIA BAlDAR_-l~ „SjlllUR On the 18th February the Governor of Bushire received a letter from the Chamber of Commerce in Tehran informing him that it had been decided (apparently by the Government) that for the future, all imports and exports through ports in Southern Iran must be forwarded through Bandar Shahpur by Railway; the Governor was instructed to telegraph to Tehran the reactions of local traders to such an order. As the imposition of such an order would completely kill Bushire from the point of view of trade the news caused no little consternation amongst the merchants. For the present however the Governor, who is convinced that there must have been some mistake in the original letter, has confined himself to a request for more exact information as to the full implications of the scheme. 26. CONDITION OF TEL COUNTRY I. Dashti and Tangistan Four Road Guards are reported to have been killed by a party of 30 villagers under the leadership of one Rais Ali Ismail a Dashtistan chieftain. The Road Guards are believed to have been escorting a shipment of contraband goods which had been seized /fromfrom smugglers* II, Laristan 1 v It is reliably reported that towards the end of January there was considerable unrest amongst the tribes in the vicinity ♦ of Lar and ’Avaz. The news was first received by the editor of the *Khalij-i^Iran* who reported the matter to Tehran* Troops have since been dispatched to Lar and the situation is said to be well in hand. III. Buahire Town Three cases of theft, in which some Rials 20,000 worth of property and ornaments were removed, were reported during the month. Two thieves have been arrested. 2 ? . CmSQ'R AT BU3HIHS Since the beginning of February a Police official has been stationed at the door of the Post Office in Bushire. His activi ties have so far been restricted to scrutinising the addresses on all envelopes posted and, judging by his reaction when confron ted with a letter addressed to H.I.M, the Shah or any member of the Royal family, his principal duty wouldappear to be to keep a check on the number of complaints sent direct to His Majesty. 28. SWGrGLim Large quantities ol smuggled tea and sugar were again seized by the Road Guards and Customs officials. In one skirmish howevez a Road Guard was wounded and the smugglers succeeded in escaping. 29. BROADCASTING reception was on bands; the Persian news from Ankara being completely jammed throughout the month. Broadcasts in Persian from .india are not listened to with any show of interest 3°.

CIVIL AVIATION IN IRAN Reference paragraph No.121 of diary for October 1939. The Governor of Bushire is still endeavouring to collect subscriptions for the formation of a Civil Aviation Service in Iran. Subscribers are reluctant to come forward however. CONSCRIPTION During the month 330 youths were recruited; 180 who had done two years’ service in the Military Barracks were disbanded and 120 old conscripts were recalled for a refresher course ft- one month. During the month one recruit committed suicide and six con scripts deserted. The reason in all cases is believed to be the ill-treatment meted out to the men by officers and general bad management in the barracks. /on- I On the 2nd November, 20 military officera’arrived here from » Tehran and left for Khorramshahr egi route for Ahwaz. A few of these, it is said, were in the Air Force. 134. DISiiHMAMSNT The military authorities continue to collect arms in the Bushire districts. During the month two persons found to be in possession of arms, and 8 rifles were brought to Bushire. A report received here states that the disarmament campaign is being vigorously carried out in Firuzabad district (about 110 miles east of Bushire) where a party of the '^ashqai Tur*cs resist ing the military authorities, killed 5 road guards. The village says the report, was later destroyed by troops sent from Shiraz and the villagers marched to Shiraz for punishment. 135. MUNICIPAL Municipal elections were held during the month and a list of the names of 29 persons elected, together with a further list of the names of 9 persons it is proposed to appoint as members of a new Municipal Council, was forwarded to the Ministry of Interior for approval. A new Chairman of the Municipal Committee has also been appointed. ’‘i 136. IRRIGATION SYSTEM IN DAHHTISTAN — V According to the Governor of Bushire a sum of Rials 2,700,000 (£ 3,375/-) has been allotted for the construction of a dam across the river Shahpur at a village/ called Saadabad in Dashtistan. In connection with this scheme a party of engineers arrived in Bushire at the beginning of November and later went to Shabankareh. A local merchant has contracted to supply 800 tons of Japanese cement for use in the dam. The whole enterprise is said to be the direct outcome of the activities 0 - H.e # Asghar Hikmat, the Minister of Interior, who owns Saadabad which will be directly benefitted by the dam. /Ther P.Z.

He is taking steps to take over the Government stocks of piecegcods from the local Company, and to open one or two shops in the town to retail cloth. He also proposes to supply cloth to such drapers as will give an adequate guarantee to sell the cloth at Government prices. Aqai Ghiathi is reported to have said that he has been instructed to sell Govemnent piecegoods at comparatively low prices to compete with smugglers. 230. iiMIGRATIOH FR O M DASHTI On the 16th May, gun-boat ‘^hahrokh 11 sized two dhows carrying 39 persons, 300 heads of sheep and cattle, 200 carpets, Rials 20,000 in currency notes, a kerosene oil tin full of silver coins, and handed the whole over to the Customs Authorities. When interrogated at the Law Court, Bushire, the men declared that the high-handed treatment meted out by the Road-Guards and Military Authorities in Dashti hah decided them to emigrate to the Arab side of the Gulf. This report is stated not to be an exaggeration as it might at first appear to be. 231. MONOPOLISATION OF WHEAT S U FPLIDS Harvesting having ended about the 15th May, Revenue Officials were sent out to the districts to buy wheat and advance money for next year’s crops.

COMMITTRF OF OFFIC I ALS FRCMF TKS MINISTRY OF THE IN TERIOR Reference paragraph No.213-11, above.—5 On arrival, the Committee gave out that their commission was to enquire into the predicament of the peasants and to devise means for the amelioration of their lot. Members of the Committee visited the hinterland and a party went as far as Lingah. The latter party reported that most of the popu lation of the Iranian ports has emigrated to the Arab side of the Gulf, and that the remaining inhabitants live in great poverty. The Committee is credited with having submitted a report to the Central Government on the subject. 2. As a measure to assist the peasantry of t he Bushire hinterland, the Committee tried, through the Governor, to persuade local merchants to form a Company for the purchase of agricul tural requirements and to advance loans to cultivators to enable them to buy the Company's goods. The merchants thought this idea altogether too philanthropic, particularly as the peasants make no purchases in the Bushire market and smuggle their small requirements, 3. The Committee deputed an Engineer to make a survey and to report on the feasibility of bringing sweet water from the Mund River (flooring into the sea about 65 miles South of Bushire) afar or from the Rud Hillah (flowing into the sea about 30 miles ITorth of Bushire). Mr. Yaghazarian, the deputed engineer, made hasty trips to the two rivers, and reported that the scheme was impracti cable. He stated that darning was possible. 4. The President of the Committee, His Excellency Dr.Elati, suggested to the Municipality the amalgamation of the Municipal Infirmary and the Hospital. He promised to increase the staff of the Hospital by a surgeon and a midwife if this were done. The Council suspected an ulterior motive, and felt the rmialga-mation of the two institutions would result in leaving the combined concern to be maintained by the Municipality. The suggestion was not adopted. The Governor is reported to have set opposition on foot. (Sd.) A.C.GALLOWAY Secretary tothe Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

At Bushire, the authorities of the Amnleh (Road Guards) and the Police authorities ordered the people not to look at the Boyal visitors from the tops of their houses or from behind their doors and windows. The Amnieh authorities went so far as to threaten to shoot down any one who dis regarded these orders and stationed guards in the houses in Naidi and Sanghi. The Governor had arranged that the members of the Chamber of Commerce, the members of the Municipality Council and some notable merchants and traders should receive the Shah at a spot midway Bahmanl and Bushire where three tents of which two had been lent by this Residency and Consulate- General, were pitched. The local Government officials, school students, a guard/5 guarci of honour consisting of a battalion of conscripts from the Garrison and a large crowd of the inhabitants both men and. women and some 50 policemen and officers who had arrived from Shiraz, had lined, the street on the sea front down to the Governor's office awaiting His Majesty's arrival. his arrival at Ganaweb seeing that very few persons had come out to receive him, His Majesty had asked as to whethei the town had no inhabitants and on being informed, by one of the peasants present, that the people did not venture out of their houses for their restrictions imposed on then by the Anmieh authorities. His Kajesty ordered that the inhahitants should be allowed to come out to meet him. 11 However, on his arrival at the merchants' tabernacles His Majesty alighted from his motor car and by way of introduc tion told his son that the people standing there and howing were the Bushiris. Aqai Sayed All Gulshani, the Head of the Chamber of Commerce, who had to welcome the royal visitors and offer them a seat in the tent did not utter a word and His Majesty the Shah looking into the tent tii and walking up and down the reception spot, pointing to the crowd said to the Crown Prince -They are alive alright; you can see their heads shaking; hut the poor things have no tongue to speak with' and drove to the town where the crowds offered him ovations as he passed through the streets. At the gate of the Governor's office the latter's daughter offered Hi s Majesty a bouquet and read a short statement welcoming the Boyal visitors. The merchants, however, attribute the failure of their spokesman to welcome the Boyal visitors to the Governor's ins truction. They say that he had instructed Sayed All Gulshani to say nothing until after he, the Governor, had introduced the crowd and had a signal for the statement to he made. the 25th March, His Majesty the Shah instructed Briga dier-General, Ibrahim Zandiah, the Offi cer Commanding the Pars division/-8 w * DivisioT5 of Shiraz, to meet the merchants at the Post office and to tell them that he was not displeased with their confu sion and inability to speak to him on his arrival and that he wished them to bring through a pipe line with drinking water for Bushire* It is reported that the merchants suggested that an Hbgineer should he sent to Bushire to survey the country with a view to finding from where drinking water could he brought in, and t© give an estimate of the cost and then they would form a Company for the purpose.

PASHTI : Reference paragraph No* 146 of Diary for October ’36 It is reported that Khalu Husain, the Chief of Burdakhan, returned to his town about the end of November after composing his differences with Captain Isfandiari. The latter, it is said, has been able to exonerate him self from the fugitive chief 1 s accusations which he has diverted to the officials of the Amnieh (Road Guards Eorce) Department. As a result of his success in this particular instance as well as in certain other questions in which the officials of the Amnieh are implicated, Isfandiari has been able to get the duty of suppressing the smuggling of contraband goods, which until now, re mained the concern of the Amnieh Department, transferred to the Military authorities. Arrangements are, therefore, being made to carry this into effect and to leave the policing of the country in the hands of the Road Guards Eorces. 2. About the middle of the month four Amnieh Guards were killed in Dashti while trying to arrest certain criminals for production before the Daw Court, Bushire.The culprits with their families, numbering some 30 per sons, have run away to mountains. 167.

Ghulam Husain HaraJ£, 'the Tangistan outlaw, was killed in a fight which he initiated in defiance of tne Military Authorities' demand for his father's arms. His father was arrested and their 'belongings plundered hy an o order from the Military Officer in charge of Dashti and fangistan.

Captain Isfandiari has been re-appointed to his former post of Military officer in charge of Dashti and Tangistan. he has commenced a severe disarmament campaign, flogging, fining and imprisoning the peasantry to make them surrender their arms which it is said they have hidden and would nolihand them over. There are of course innocent persons amongst the accused possessors of arms who suffer at Isfandiari # s and his subordinates* hands and become the victims of their avarice, in consequence of these authorities* high handed treatment some 50 Tangistanies came in and complained to the Governor and petitioned to him to alleviate their distress. The Governor having re commended them to the Military Authorities at Bushire f or- assistance sent their petition to the Ministry of Interior to be placed before His Majesty the Shah. This, however, would have little effect against isfandiari, as he has the high military officials at Shiraz on his side and it is they who supported him against the complaints made against him in April 1936. 105.

QkIAVIMG HOftlfi 1 iroB 3USHIHB8 Towards the end of the month Aqa Husain I'atimad iMr.Agar) of the firm of Haji All Akbar and sons ahirazi, Manchester, visited Bushire and informed the local mer chants of his intention of installing a weaving plant here for weaving white shirting and sateen, similar to the fabrics which his firm dealt in until a few years ago m Manchester, bocal merchants welcomed his suggestion aid offered to buy shares in the plant. In fact one of themEaji AMur Hasul Hais-ut-Tujjar, offered to contribute half the cost of the plant namely Bials 1,500,000 (£ 18750) and the other merchants have protested that he should not invest so much in the concern 'but should give them a chance to participate in it. Mr. Agar having seen such a ready welcome from Bushire merchants left for Tehran to arrange facilities for 'bringing his plants to Bushire. Seeing that this new enterprise would much affect their 'business the merchants of Shiraz have since approa ched Mr .Agar to instal the new plant in their city 'but, it is reported, he would not accede to theiiv'irequest as he has, in his previous dealings with them, received such treatment as not to induce him^ again to enter into further 'business relations with them. The Governor of Bushire has since sent a telegram requesting his Government to render mt.A gar all assis tance in this matter. J-f it materialises, this new enterprise will supplant the idea of the formation of a Steam Navigation Company which his Excellency fmanullah Ardelan,the previous aovernor, inaugurated in Becemher 1935. 108. edugat'IQN : X. The Director of Education, Bushire, has la_tely -been instructed to open 20 free schools in the Iranian port towns for the benefit of the grown up citizens there. Out of these 20 schools 5 are to he opened at Bushire. This measure is said to be the first step towards en forcing compulsory education, first the illiterate Iranian Government officials will he forced to learn the art of reading and writing in these schools and later the citizens will he compelled to attend lessons m the said art. P xhe Governor, Bushire, has also been ordered hy-3- ttie Ministiry of interior to prepare a list of the des titute children and orphans in the town and the cost of their maintenance, clothing and education, and submit a report to the Ministry in order that the dovernmsnt may build a school for them and train them there in some handicrafts. These measures will much mitigate the people f s grumblings against the military compulsory service in force in the country. 109.

Re has been forging the signatures of his superiors, issuing cheques under their forged signatures and pocketing the money.

POLICE : It has been reliably stated that the Iranian Go vernment intend opening Police Offices and Police Stations throughout Dashti and Tangistan. The Police Authorities here have so far taken no measures in that direction as they can ill afford to spare officers for the new organi sations and the climatic conditions in those districts deter officers coming down from Tehran* 61. SUPPRESSION OP THE MUEABRAM MOUBNING : At the beginning of the month of Muharram* evidently under orders from Tehran, the Police Authorities here took measures to prevent breast-beating and the holding of Passion Plays in commemoration of the martyrdom of Husain* a Saint of the Shi 1 ah Sect which took place at Kerbela in 681 A *D. The recitation of the story was, however, left alone at that time. Recently they ordered that the recitation of the event should also oe given up. This abrupt step taken against a long standing religious practice, dating as far back as the beginning of the Sufavia dynasty which came to power in 1499 A.D. has exasperated the general public, priests and preachers* They Consider it heretical and sacrilegious out for the strength of the Central Government they dare not give vent to their feelings* 62. the carryi ng trade ; Reference paragraph No.48 of Diary for March 1936.

The weights in Kilo and Kilogrammes are made of Brass and each set costs liials 250.

During December the gun-boat 'Shahrokh'* called at Bushire on her cruises down and up Persian Gulf. AVIATION . I., British. 1. Reference paragraph No. 129 (6) of November 1934. On the 4th December a telegram was received fromAerodrome, Karachi, asking for information as to the whereabouts of Lady Blanch Scott Douglas who was on a flight from England to India. At that time nothing was known in Bushire about Lady Douglas except the fact that she had passed through Bushire on the 30th November. Telegraphic enquiries were therefore made from Bandar Abbas, Jask, Oharbar and Henjam but with out result. On the 5th December a Tangistani with a note from Lady Douglas arrived and reported that her aeroplane had a forced landing at Masi1eh-i-Bahmani, a hamlet some 60 miles south of Bushire, but that she and her pilot were safe. She asked for some lubricating oil to be sent out. On the 6th December a relief party with 2 motor cars carrying food and a solderer (the only mechanic available at Bushire) was sent out. Exceptionally heavy rains which had recently fallen had made large tracts of the country side impassable for motors. In consequence the party had to cover the remaining 9 miles to Masileh-i-Babmari on foot. On arrival xi on the afternoon of the 8th December they found Lady Douglas and the pilot Mr. Ogden safe and the damage to the aeroplane confined to a broken oil, pipe. The oil pipe having been repaired it ms found necessary to lighten the aeroplane as much as possible to enable it to get off the boggy ground. After five un successful attempts the machine with Mr. Ogden alone in it managed to take off and arrived in Bushire on the 10 th. Meanwhile lady Douglas had left with the relief party for Bushire overland. Between Masileh-i-Bahmani end the spot where the cars had been left lies the4 Mxmd river wiiicb. normally is shallow and easily fcrd- ahle. By this time however owing to the heavy rains which had fallen almost continually the river was in full flood with a swiftly flowing current. The party succeeded in getting across only with the greatest difficulty - the Residency Interpreter who was one of the members being carried several hundred yards down stream and Lady Douglas having to swin across with the help of 2 men. On the 13th December a report was received that the relief party’s cars on their way back had broken down near Khormuj the principal village of the district. Accordingly Mr. Ogden accompanied by an Interpreter of the Residency set out in a car on the 1 4th with spare parts., The parties met on the 14th some 20 miles from Bushire to which they returned the same day, Lady Douglas and Mr* Ogden being accommodated at the Babzabad Residency* Valuable assistance was given in the stranded aviators by the Officer Commanding Dashtistan District, Sultan (Captain) Isfandiari. On first hearing of the forced landing he endeavoured to send 2 motor cars to their assistance but as the Mund river proved unford able he despatched 4 soldiers to act as guards. Until the arrival of these soldiers on the 4th December Lady Douglas and Mr* Ogden had been living and sleeping partially in shallow i-d'ks scooped out of the ground under the aeroplane and partially in the aeroplane itself* The headman of Masileh-i-Bahmani then arrived and gave them a room in his house in that hamlet where they remained until the arrival of the rescue party. Apparently none the worse for their adventures Lady Douglas and Hr. Ogden left for Bandar Atfoas on the16th December. Eere while landing the nose of the aeroplane hit the ground and the propeller ?/as damag ed • In spite of this further mishap the aeroplane managed to get through to Jask on the 18th where at the end of the month the aviators were awaiting the arrival of a new propeller. 2.

The Education Department, Bushire .— This Department which has been under Shiraz for the past two years, has now been made independent and will hence forth be under the direct control of the Ministry of Education in Tehran. 2. The Khcdij-i-Iran .—This Bushire weekly in its issue No. 32, dated the 29tii August, published a news item stating that small-pox and typhoid broke out in Bora/- jan and other towns in Dashti and Dash- tistan and that many of the population died for want of medical treatment ; that a Doctor went there from Shiraz and did some relief work. Commenting on this point the Editor observed that had there been four doctors in the Bushire Hospital one or two of them could have been sent to the affected areas and the heavy mortality avoided. In Daleki alone 80 children died. The fact that the medical man sent from Shiraz perforce took longer to reach the spot than would one sent from Bushire, was enlarg ed upon. These remarks published at a time when there was only one doctor in charge of the Hospital and Quarantine Office, were much appreciated by the towns-people but appeared to exasperate the Governor of Bushire. The latter taking them to be detracting to his administration instructed the Police to take a letter of undertaking from the two presses in Bushire not to set in types anything received from the Editor for publication. This action was taken just when Tehran newspapers were pub lishing lengthy articles about doctors in Persia. Also being apparently unwar ranted by any law, it gave some grounds for grumbling and the complaint that the Government stifled the “ Khalij-i-Iran ” and this prevented it from publishing facts about the Health Department. The “ Khalij-i-Iran ” had not resumed publication by the end of September. 104. The Customs Preventive Depart ment. The officials of this Department caught a sailing vessel endeavouring to unload a small quantity of sugar, tobacco., piece- goods and Saccharine at the landing stage adjoining the Customs. 105.

The troops brought back a few prisoners including one Rustom, son of Abdullah, of Barishkhan (15 miles from Jask) who was publicly shot on the 9th September. This man had been looking after Chiragh Khan’s cattle during the latter’s absence from the districts. The execution took place about 100 yards from the East tank within the boundry of the telegraph con cession area. 2. It is reported that Morad, son of Mustafa Khan, returned from Arabia and landed at Kuh-i-Mubarak on the 2nd Sep tember and proceeded towards Bashkard accompanied by 20 armed followers with 2 camel loads of ammunition. 3. During the first week of September Naghdi Khan, son of Murad Khan, who was raiding in the Minab district also left for Bashkard. 4. On the 14th September, Naghdi Khan and Morad Khan, were joined by Chiragh Khan and his ally Jalal Khan at Sardasht in Bashkard. After this meeting Naghdi raided Jagin and carried away 400 sheep, 8 cows and 14 camels. The Persian Mili tary post at Gazden, was informed but it refused to act without definite orders. 5. A chief named Abdul Karim who had been imprisoned |it Jask for several weeks was eventually sentenced to death for the murder of his wife and he was executed in Sadech on the 16th September. II. Charbar—Condition of the Coun try .—The Officer-in-Charge, Imperial and International Communications, Ltd., Charbar, reports that Sir Muhammad Khan, son of Dilmurad, forcibly took away wife, daughter and sister-in-law of Gan gal, son of Faqir Muhammad, a British subject resident in Dyastari and held them to ransom, released them on payment of Rs. 600 and camel. This Shir Muhammad has threatened several other merchants of Dyastari that he would treat them in a similar manner should they delay in producing the sums of money demanded from them. 2. Shir Muhammad accompanied by Mir Alxli Khan, son of Charshambeh Zallai and Hashum, son of Kiya, have all met together at Khan Shir Muhammad’s village.

Chiragh, as it is reported, accuses the men abducted by him or his followers of assisting the Persian Military and releases them on payment of a ransom. He has notified them that he would hand over camels belonging to private individuals on payment of Rials twenty-five each but that this does not apply to the Persian Military camels which he would not restore. 8. On the 24th June Sultan Jangjoo succeeded in sending Mir Hoti to Chiragh Khan to demand return of the Military camels captured by his men as mentioned in paragraph 4 above. And, with a view to conciliating him, he was informed that should he remain quiet a subsidy might be arranged. After a week Mir Hoti returned with an insolent reply and challenge. 9. On the- 20th June Lieutenant Asad Ullah Khan with one hundred and fifty men from the Zaboli regiment left Jask and encamped at Bahai, nine miles east of Jask. 10. Sultan Jangjoo, the Officer-in-Charge of Troops left for Bahai on the 28th June. Here he took charge of the troops and set out for Luh. About the same time it was reported that Chiragh Khan had left Luh and that his whereabouts were unknown. A few days before that date Chiragh Khan sent his wives and a large amount of his property to the £ ' Kuh-i-Rahman ” in the Bashakard district. Mir Hoti however has been forced to accompany the troops on this expedition. 11. Naghdi Khan son of Murad Khan raided Bahmadi (15 miles from Jask) and captured several animals, two men and their goods. His father, it is reported, will return shortly to Jask from Arabia. II. — Biahan. —On the 12th June the Revenue Officer, Minab, accompanied by three soldiers and a local guide arrived at Biaban 'and accused Hasan Yar Muham mad Tahirzai of having collected the sum of Rials 30,000 in taxes and to have paid only Rials 16,000 to the Government. The accused denied having done this but a few of the people of Biaban gave evidence that he had collected the larger amount; he was placed under arrest with a view to being taken to Minab. While at Ziarat en route for that destination the Tahirzais intercept ed the caravan and killed the Revenue Officer, his three soldiers and guide and released Hasan Yar Muhammad. These Tahirzais returned to Pirahak in Basha kard taking with them twenty rifles, and 20,000 rounds of ammunition supplied to them by the Persian Officials for Amniah purposes (guarding caravan routes). They are said to have eighty other rifles and six boxes of ammunition formerly belonging to Mir Barakat Khan. It is also reported that they have sent messengers to Abdul Husain of Mars informing him of the incident and asking his help. 2. On the 23rd June a dhow from Muscat discharged fifty loads of sugar and fifty loads of cloth at a spot between Galag and Kuch. Lieutenant Wahabi and twenty- «five men intercepted the caravan, the goods were confiscated and two men were wound ed. 3.

Reference paragraph No. 107 of Novem- ber-December 1932. Bushire Spinning and Weaving Plant.— Having studied the requirements, Messrs Tweedles and Smalley (1920) Limited C astleton, Manchester, did not consider ii practicable to supply a Plant capable oj producing the various patterns of cloths, it is proposed to produce, to come within' the3 figure of £20,000 stipulated. They W therefore sent quotations for a complete Spinning,. Weaving, Bleaching and Finnish- * n g plant which will cost the Company or ^&gt;he Bushire merchants £2,807-10-6. The Spinning Plant they say comprises 4,360 spindles capable of producing 1,092 lbs. of warp yarn per 10 hours of average 20s. counts and 992 lbs. of weft yarn per 10 Fours of average 18s. counts. They further say that the Weaving Plant of 120 Looms is suitable for weaving plain cloths up to 40' wide. The Bleaching and Finishing Plant is easily capable of dealing with this produc tion. According to the Company the importa tion of an expert to instal the machinery would involve the following expenditure ;— Wages £9-10-0 a week. A Second Class P. &amp; O. Passage (or equivalent) out and home. Half rate of wages when travelling and full rate when sick with medical attendance and medicine if the sickness is not the fault of the man. Taxes payable abroad to be paid and a life insurance Policy of £300 obtained for him. The Governor who is the moving spirit in the project, has been informed, verbally, of the above and is now in touch with the merchants on the subject. 53. Economic condition. Beference paragraph No. 36 of April 1933. There has been no appreciable change in the economic situation. 54. Condition of the Country. A.

The driver in escaping drove his vehicle at a high speed with the result that his cleaner (then fast asleep on the top of the cargo) was thrown down. The robbers caught the boy and their threats failing to make the driver stop, killed him. B. Dashti .—On the 10th of May a heavy fall of hail caused much damage to fruit trees and date palms in several villages in Dashti in particular in the vicinity of Ahram and Muhammadabad. C. Bushire Pcmw.—Five cases of theft are reported to have been committed in the town and property worth a little over Tomans five hundred removed from shops and houses visited by the thieves. Only in one instance the thief was arrested by the Police. 2. The Muharram mournings ended with out any accident.

During the month under reference the undermentioned ships of the Persian Navy cruised between Mohammerah, Bushire, Lmgah, Bandar Abbas and other ports :— The sloop “ Babr The gun-boats “ Simurgh ” and “ Karkas ,5 , and The gun-boat t{ Chahrok 56. Military. A. Bushire. Two of the Bushire con scripts deserted the Military barracks. The reason for their so doing is said to have been inadequate feeding arrangements and hard ships experienced. 2. A few of them who had completed two years service were released within the month. 3. A Sarhang arrived at Bushire on the 4th May on inspection and invited all who think themselves oppressed in connection with their enrolment in the compulsory service to submit their petition to enable him to right their wrong. He remained here for about a fortnight and then pro ceeded to Borazjan to inspect the con scription proceedings and issue of Census papers there. B. Borazjan .—It was reported during the month that about two hundred youths were enrolled at Borazjan for compulsory ser vice they having been found of military a g e * -By the end of the period under re ference only fifty of these had arrived at Bushire and joined the barracks at Bahmani. _ C.

Local Government. A. The Customs Preventive Department. This Department having found the services of the Aminiah guards employed by it for the suppression of the smuggling trafficunsatisfactory decided to form a new party to t 8 Cn S Ul ! der a militar y officer looking Iw^:* 0Dly their wa 8 es an5 a nthn therefore employed a Lieutenant, tarv , mmi ® sloned officer from the Mili tary to organise a small body of guards to tackle smugglers.

Many others were also arrested under suspicion of their being abettors of or actually smugglers. Onf Lutt Ah Kazeruni presumed to be a smug- gler was seized and detained in the mili tary barracks and tbe officials would not release fiim even on bail. 5. This activity of the Naval Officer and ms men having been carried out in the absence of tbe representatives of tbe Police and Law Court more especially on account ot its being lucrative to bis men and cer tamly injurious to other smugglers nro- vided a good cause for all to compkin against him.

The Persian Baluchistan. Keference paragraph No. 33 of March 1933. Sardar Husain Khan having undertaken the (evidently nominal) post of Administra tor of the Persian Mekran occupied himself with the disarmament of the district under his jurisdiction and collected four hundred rifles there. While he was thus occupied at Pir, one Mir Mirza, a local chief, was arrested by Sultan Jangju and sent to Charbar. This act much alarmed the Sardar, so he went back to his own town Geh and sent a protest pointing out that the act of the Sultan is in contravention of his (the Sardar’s) authority. The Persian officials disregarding this protest sent three hundred horsemen and arrested Mir Ayub Khan, Naqdi Khan, Muhammad Jafar Khan and Shahwar Khan and sent them to Khwash. Sardar Husain Khan is reported to be waiting for an opportunity to take to his heels towards the mountains after he has gleaned his dates. 2. Mir Hooti, a chief of Lashar, with a following of about four hundred men has already resorted to mountain fastnesses harbouring the family of his contemporary rebel Abdul Husain of Bashakard and has remained adamantine in refusing the invi tation of the Persian officials to visit them. Another chief, Kamal Khan with fifty/ .sixty followers, has followed in the footsteps of Mir Hooti and has taken his abode in .Sagim hills. 3. The high-handed treatment accorded to the people by the Persian Military offi cials at Charbar is reported to know no bounds. They commandeer firewood and pay the trivial price of Rials 1-50 (annas three) for a load. This has already dis couraged the peasantry from bringing in fuel into the town. Camels are being com mandeered and, far from paying any hire for the work done, they do not feed the animals either. Their grain is ground free by the peasantry and the Kadkhudas are looked to to see it done. 4. Reference paragraph No. 47 (1) of April 1933. On the 3rd May 20 of Chiragh Khan’s followers raided Ekdar and looted 120 maunds of grain, four donkeys, 2 camels and gold ornaments to the value of Rupees one hundred and fifty. They also abducted three men. On the 8th May Chiragh raided Jagin and took away two camels, one donkey, and carpets with cloth. Naghdi Khan, Chi- ragh’s brother, carried out a similar raid on Bahmadi. Chiragh Khan subsequently took refuge in the hills at Luh where, it is reported, a party of Persian troops, about seventy- five strong is stationed. 5. Concession Area. —Reference para graph No. 47 (3) of April 1933. The Officer-in-Charge, Imperial and In ternational Communications Company, Limited, Jask, reports :— u It is essential that a boundary for the telegraph premises here should be arranged. Troops are causing a lot of annoyance ; their camels are frequently turned out and foul our catchment areas also damage trees. Men are constantly loafing in our engine room and garden and peering into the bun galow. They also wash their clothes and themselves in the Dhobi’s tank. Complaints ¥ to the Officer Com manding Troops and Governor have little effect. Apart from the lack of privacy they are very un desirable visitors. They have com- mitted several burglaries in the village recently ”. (Sd.) A. C.

Reference para graph No. 16 (1) of February 1933. Reports that reached Bushire during the month stated that the Qashqai rebel Ali Khan continued stubbornly in his resist ance and having the advantage of an in accessible mountain position inflicted losses to his assailants the Persian Troops. It was further said that the Persian Military au thorities were keeping the number of their casualties and the re-enforcements they send to fight this rebel, strictly secret. The mercenaries recruited in Dashti and Kazerun to help the Persian troops are said to have sustained heavy casualties— they lost more than half their number. 2. Husain Rostum, a Chief of Tangistan who had been sent to Tehran two years ago, was brought back to help in collecting mercenaries to help the Persian Troops. He collected eight hundred men in Tangis tan and Dashti. These with a fresh force which, it is said, has been recently sent to the Qashqai district are trying to hem in Ali Khan and his men. A party of about .one hundred of Ali Khan’s men visited Dashti with a view, perhaps, to buying arms and ammunition for their Chief, but it was routed bv Mahmood Khan Parvin who arrested twenty-eight of them. Ali Khan s activities have so far been confined to his own district. 27. Local Government. Bushire Town and Suburbs. — 1. In the beginning of the month Mrs. Fricke, wife of the Manager of the National Bank of Persia, Bushire, while returning home from a walk was attacked by a man who attempt ed to divest her of her personal ornaments and clothes. He threw the lady into a stone quarry near by and took away her hand bag. This is an unprecedented affair in Bushire. A man identified by Mrs. Fricke to be the transgressor was arrested and detained in the Police Jail where he was interro gated. Here as well as at the Law Court the suspect categorically denied having committed the crime though he was often tried and cross-examined. He was sub sequently released on bail pending further enquiries. 2. Commencing at about the same time and lasting for a fortnight two gangs of robbers one of which had come from Bida about fifty-five miles north of Shiraz and the other made up of Tangistanis began a series of burglaries in the suburbs of Bushire. Every night some sort of burg lary was committed. On the night of the 22nd/23rd March the house of the Secretary to the Political Resident and that of Mr. Fricke, the Manager of the National Bank of Persia, were visited. From the first place a saddle and horse blanket and a few other articles w T ere removed and from the latter all the clothes that Mr. Fricke possessed. These two as well as another case of burg lary took place almost under the nose of the Governor of Bushire whose house is adjacent. The Bida thieves who had become known as the “ bleating thieves ” (for they first bleated like the sheep in the vicinity of the houses they wanted to visit) had pitched their tents at Goorak a village some seven miles south-east of the town. The Police denied responsibility and the Amniah in whose jurisdiction the burglaries took place as well the military were both unable to trace the burglars and non-plussed as to who they were. A shepherd ultimately reported having seen some men burying articles near about the above mentioned village and at the expense of the Munici pality motor cars were sent to the spot. The thieves had somehow or other warning as they ran away across the Mashileh. Their women folk were arrested and broughtto the police Office but the 3 r still deny all knowledge of the doings or the whereabouts of their men. Almost two-thirds of the articles stolen have been dug up and restored to their owners. One individual of the Tangistani gang was caught red handed by a Policeman who wounded him in the arm. He at present denies having any connection with the other robbers. 3. A few cases of theft took place in the town also in which about Tomans eight hundred worth of cash and articles were taken. 28. Military. I. Conscription, Bushire. —1. Reference paragraph No. 18 (2) of February 1933. The Conscription Office, Bushire, was closed during the first week of the month. Inuring the days it held office the Com mittee of Conscription found four hundred of the town youths eligible for military service. About sixty of them have been exempted from the service because of their being bread-winners of their relatives or physically unfit. 2. Many of the officers and non-com missioned officers have been promoted to higher ranks. Four corporals have been made third lieutenants ; several third Lieutenants have been made second lieu tenants ; four second lieutenants have been made first lieutenants and one first lieu tenant has been given the rank of Captain. II. Borazjan .—A Conscription Office was opened at Borazjan about the middle of March and work commenced. It is anticipated that about three hundred youths of that country-town will be enrolled for military service. 29. Municipal. The Bushire Municipality .—Out of the grand total of 800,000 Tomans collected as Road Tax by the Customs in Persia during last year ending by the 21st March 1932 the sum of Tomans 17,000 has been allotted to the Bushire Municipality for town improvement. It has since paid Tomans 10,000 out of the amount to the Munici palities of Lingah, Bandar Abbas and Borazjan for the same purpose. With the remaining Tomans 7,000 the Bushire Municipality has built a dyke on the sea front south-east of the town ; repaired the sea embankments, and built a low wall on them ; metalled the bazaar streets ; and is constructing a new road extending from behind the Customs Offices to join the Bushire-Shiraz road with a branch going round the old gate of the town to enable lorries and motor cars to communicate freely between the Customs Offices and the various garages situated outside the town and thus to avoid the present narrow and over-crowded street which goes through the unsavoury bazaar. 30. The Persian Navy. During March the following ships of the Persian Navy visited Bushire :— The “ Babr ” sloop. The “ Chahrock ” gun-boat. The “ Shahbaz ” gun-boat. The “ Simurgh ” gun-boat. 1. On the 3rd March when the “ Chahrock ” arrived at Bushire she landed 29 Arabs of the Shib-Kuh district all Persian subjects. It is given out that while coming up from Lingah she met with two motor dhows making for Bahrain. When she asked them to stop for inspection one of them which was some distance off made off but the second dhow opened fire on the gun boat damaging her cabins. “ Chahrock ” therefore fired on it killing one and wound ing another out of the thirty occupants who were all armed with rifles. The dhow was rammed and broke into two parts and was left at Teban in charge of the Mudir of Customs ; thereafter she was denuded of her engine. Her cargo consisted of two bales carpets, fifteen bags of cash and three hundred sheep. The bales of carpets, money and a very few of the sheep were saved for the use of “ Chahrock Three of the thirty occupants of the dhow are merchants engaged in the smug gling trade. The rest, were crew and hired guards. 2. The “ Shahbaz ” also caught a sailing boat carrying a few bundles of piece-goods and forty bags of contraband sugar. The boat was trying to make Muqam a port in the Shib-Kuh region. The “ Babr ” brought in two Shaikhs from the Shib-Kuh for detention pending delivery by them of a certain number of rifles which they are reported to have in their possession. 3. Reference paragraph 19 (2) of Feb ruary 1933. Those of the personnel of the Persian Navy the term of whose service as cons cripts will expire on the 1st Urdibehisht 1312 (21st April 1933) were notified that they will be paid Tomans fifteen a month plus uniform and food should they choose to continue serving in the Navy. These con ditions may perhaps induce a good number of the conscript sailors to remain in the Navy.r 4 31. The Customs Preventive Depart ment. The officials of this Department have been able to capture about eighty bags of sugar which were being smuggled into the town and suburbs. 32. Inspection. Aqai Miftah, Examiner of High Court, Tehran, summoned a few of those who were accused a few years ago by the Customs (Bushire) of the smuggling of contraband goods only to record that enquiries in their cases were not discon tinued. He then summoned Haji Abdur Kasul Rais-ut-Tujjar of Bushire, who had stated in writing to the Committee of Inspection which came to Bushire in 1931 that he paid Tomans three hundred to Monsieur Wolters through Frutan in con nection with a consignment of sixty cases of opium which he released just a little time before export duty on the article was increased by the Government. The Haji again admitted verbally that he paid the amount to Monsieur Wolters. Miftah thereupon sent him to the Police Station where he remained until his son stood bail in Tomans two thousand when he was allowed to go home. Miftah has since sent the dossier of th e case to Tehran to the Special Criminal Court for Trying Government Officials. 33. Persian Baluchistan. I. Qasr-i-Qand District. —A report re ceived from Charbar states that one Ashraf Baluchi having rebelled against the Persian Government went to Tawakul near Qasr-i- Qand with a view to plundering a British subject named Haji Sabeel. Another Baluchi Chief on account of an old standing friendship with the Haji saved the latter’s life and property. Ashraf, disappointed in this attempt, left Tawakul for Qasr-i- Qand and Sarbaz districts where he pillages and plunders whatever that he can lay his hand on. II. Bir District. —It is reported that Sultan Gangjoo, the Persian Officer Com manding Troops, has arrested one Mirza, son of Mir Haleh who had acted as a guide to Abdul Husain when the latter first went to the Sarmali mountains. The notables of Bir are said to have sent their families to the mountains and are impatiently waiting the release of the said Mirza. Sardar Hasan Khan who is siding with the Persian military and is disarming the people of Qarvan has interceded for the release of Mirza and it is hoped that his request will be met by Sultan Gangjoo.

Persian Interests. His Imperial Majesty the Shah's visit .—From the beginning of the month rumours were presistent that His Imperial Majesty Reza Shah would visit Bushire for the inspection of the six patrol boats built for Persia in Italy and which were expected to arrive at Bushire before the end of October. On the 15th it became known that His Majesty and suite would arrive at Shiraz on the 9th or 10th Abanmah 1311 (31st October) or a day later and would leave for Bushire after two days there. H. E. the Governor ordered the repair of houses situated in the streets leading to the Amiriah. This was all done but not without a certain amount of heart burning by the lucky houseowners. The Municipality (as host of His Majesty) made active preparations for the occasion. H. E. the Governor arranged to give His Majesty a reception at the Burj-i- Muqam (7 miles outside the town). He therefore invited Foreign and Persian Officials, the notable merchants, traders, the Ulema and all the school boys to attend. His Excellency applied to this Resi dency for tents and also for whisky and aerated water and these were supplied to him. On instructions received from Hif Imperial Majesty Foreign Consuls were informed that they need not attend the reception but that special orders would be issued in due course. From the 30th October the Shiraz- Bushire road was closed to all motor car and caravan traffic and Amniah guards were stationed at different points to ensure perfect safety for His Majesty’s passages over the road. 128. The Persian Navy. On the 29th October the six patrol ships constructed for the Persian Gov ernment in Italy arrived at Bushire: their names are :— “ Babr.” “ Palang.” “ Shahbaz ”. “ Shahrokh “ Karkas “ Simugh ”. They are said to have cost Persia Tomans 3,600,OOu. A day prior to their arrival at Bushire merchants, traders and shopkeepers were called upon by the Governor to illuminate their offices and shops in honour of the occasion. Only some of the merchants, a few traders and some of the shopkeepers did this. The naval officers landed at Bushire immediately on their arrival here and were received by a military band at the Customs quay. His Excellency the Governor gave them a dinner at the Amiriah and Messrs. Kazeruni and Behbehani, Bushire merchants gave the officers and crew of the ships the follow ing presents — 18,000 Persian cigarettes (by Kazeruni). 26 carpets of medium prices (by Behbehanies). 800 Yazdi handkerchiefs (by Behbehanies). 800 pairs Persian socks (by T Behbehanies). 800 packets Persian cigarettes (by Behbehanies). a129.

He closed down the Dabistan-i-Ferdausi, one of the local schools, and added its budget to that of the Saadat Middle School. This latter is subsidised by the Government and last year incurred a debt of Tomans 400 to the Municipality, Bushire. He is trying to transfer from the Government Schools to the Saadat School those children who can afford to pay Rials 5 or 10 a month. This would show that the Persians far from showing an inclination to raise the budgets of the Education Department of the South ern Ports want to run the schools as economically as possible. 3. Elections. —On the 20th October His Excellency the Governor of Bushire convened a meeting of the local mer chants, Ulema, and notables of the town.

Sayed Saleh Tabib, (Doctor). 6. Mirza Ali Akbar Dawani. 7. Mirza Ahmad Borazjani. 8. Sayed Muhammad Tabatebai. 9. Mirza Abbas Salami.

An invitation to a reception to be held in a garden outside the city gate was issued to the leading merchants, Bank Managers, and the Consuls for 1 p.m. Owing to the Shah’s premature arrival (by one hour) notice of which was not given of the British, French and Soviet Consular representatives only the Russian Consul-General reached the garden in time.

The charge brought against him, however, is for the defalcation of only Rials 20,000 and not Bials 120,000 as mentioned in the paragraph under reference. 116. Persian Baluchistan. • 1. — Jash. 1. Reference paragraph 101 of 1932. On the 25th August 1932 Murad Khan left the Jask district via Sadich for the Arab Coast. He took 30 of his followers with him and left 25 to guard Luh. He told the rest of his men that he would return and that as long as they remained in the hills they would be free from molestation. 2. On the 16th September 1932 Mir Chiragh, Azam Khan and Mohim Khan also left for the Arab Coast via Sadich.3 It is reported that they captured a sailing boat which had just arrived there from Minab with a cargo of dates and compelled the crew to take them ^ to the Arab Coast. The JS'akhoda was busy with customs officials. 3. The Clerk-in-Charge of Telegraphs, Jask, reports as under :— “ I called on the new Sultan (Colonel in-Command) on the oth evening and he informed me that he had stationed men near our telegraph lines at intervals of four farsakhs (about 15 miles) with instruc tions to patrol the lines and see that no damage is done. Upon enquiries being made it transpired that these men are patrolling the coast and that they have been stationed there to re-establish the Customs posts which were deserted four months ago. Our lines in some cases run as far as 15 miles from the Coast.” 200 soldiers arrived at Jask in the beginning of September and were distri buted as follows :— d0 at Yakdar. 50 „ Sadich. 35 ,, Old Jask. 10 „ Ekbuni (3 miles from Jask) # 6 near Hoshdan. and the remaining 39 were kept at Jash. 4. I he Persian patrols along the Im perial and International Communications Company’s land lines seem to be unable to check damage to them : during the first fortnight of September some 300 insulators were reported to have been damaged or wilfully removed. These patrols cause the company’s men a cer tain amount of annoyance as they are fond of commandeering their animals. In one instance two camels were taken at Yakdar from one of their linesmen by one Lieutenant Jaafar Khan iiispite of the fact that the man showed the Lieutenant a Certificate he had been provided by the Sultan (Colonel-in- Command) at Jask for to prevent such occurrences. Jaafar Khan disregard ed the Certificate and said that the Sultan was the Chief at Jask but that he was the Chief at Yakdar”. The animals were returned after they were employed for six days but the Lieutenant refused to pay their hire except for one camel and that at the rate of Rials 3 per diem. The Clerk-in-Charge reports that the Shltan at Jask has been very helpful and has promised to set such matters right soon. 5. The Persian Expedition against the Baluchis has proved a failure. It returned to Yakdar on the 15th September and left for Gabrig on the 17th. They have asked Mustafa Khan (now in Bashkard) to surrender all arms. The Chief has replied that he was collecting some. All that the troops succeeded in doing was that they confiscated a few old and useless rilies. The good ones have been hidden. 6. Abdul Husain is reported to have collected a following of about 600 armed men at Mars, in Bashkard district. Men who were formerly the followers of Murad Khan and Chiragh Khan are now flocking to his banner. His objective is unknown. 7. Ali Hoti has been sent to Bandar Abbas to stand his trial before a Military tribunal there. 11—.Concession Area .—Reference para graph 6tf(a), section 2 of A-ugust 1932. 8. The Clerk-in-Charge reports that work on Sayed Hasan’s house situated in the Concession Area has ceased for the last month. The walls are three feet high. 117. Mohammerah. Iraq Interests 1.—The Iraq Vice- Consul, Mohammerah informed H. B. M.’s Vice-Consulate there that in accordance with a communication received from the Iraq Minister for Foreign Affairs, Baghdad, the Iraq Vice-Consulate, Mohammerah shgfl^Jd in future, be addressed “ The Iraq Government Consulate for Khuzistan, Mohammerah.” 2. Abdul Majed Beg Allawi, the Iraq Consul, Mohammerah made prepara tions for the celebration of the Coronation Day of His Majesty King Faizal on the 23rd August but unfor tunately owing to the detention by the Customs of all cases of provision and stores imported by the Consul for the entertainment of guests and refusal of the Customs authorities to allow the importation of these without licence, no reception was held.4 118. Russian Interests. The Russian trade is very dull at Mohammerah and the Russian firm “ Vanishtorg ” made advances in August to certain Arab landlords for the purchase of dates. 119. Persian Interests. 1. Under instructions from the Central Administration, Tehran the Governor of the Mohammerah held an election for the appointment of the members of the Chamber of Com merce, Mohammerah. The following were elected :— Haji Abdus Sahib Bahrain. Dooraqi. Behbehani. Jalal Muaqqar. Sayed Muhammad Ali Mustoufi. Haji Muhammed Sadeqi. Abdul Ali Dizfuli. Haji Muhammad Husain Isfahani. Haji Mushir, son of Haji Rais-ut- Tujjar. Out of the above, three were elected as Managing Members to wit :— Haji Abdus Sahib Bahraini, Presi dent. Jalal Muaqqar, Vice-President. Haji Muhammad Sadeqi, Clerk. The result of the election was reported to and approved by the Central Admi nistration. 2. Military. — Munition .—On the 9th September the Officer Commanding, Mohammerah released from the Customs 55 cases of arms and ammuni tion which were imported from Germany per the s. s. “ Erissenfels They were sent to Ahwaz on the 23rd. 3. Cement ,—On receipt of instructions from the Commander-in-Chief, Ahwaz the Officer Commanding Troops, Mohammerah ordered 100 bags of English cement from Basrah through a Jew merchant Saleh Hoogi. The consignment arrived on the 24th and was sent to Ahwaz the same day. 4. New Rials .—On the 19th Septem ber the National Bank, Mohammerah received a consignment of 50 cases of new Rial currency notes from America and despatched the same to Tehran on the 25th. C 120. Shiraz. 1. Law and Order .—Security was somewhat worse during the month. On September 3rd a force of 200 troops left in the direction of Ardakan and on the 9th, 300 troops Were sent to Ab-i- Barik (about 10 miles out of Shiraz along the Isfahan road) where three lorries had been plundered. These instances are remarkable in that they constitute the first use of troops in such large numbers. In the second case some of the goods were recovered. About the 15th September a lorry containing opium was attacked in the “ Tang-i-Qadirabad ” (Isfahan Road). The Amniah succeeded in recovering the major portion of this later in the month. 2. National Bank .—Under instructions from Tehran the Director of Finance, Shiraz entered the National Bank and checked its books on the 6th September. It is doubtful whether this in any case would have been of much use as it is improbable that any member of the Finance Department has sufficiently good knowledge of banking practices to render such a check effective. The Bank opened for business as usual the following day. The flight or Herr Vogel and the rumours connected with the management of the National Bank had an unfavourable effect on the Bank’s business in Shiraz. 121. Bandar Abbas. 1. Customs .—On the 9th September the Customs Department, Bandar Abbas sent three Mudirs with staff in their boat the “ Gillan ” for establishing Customs posts in three small posts between Sirik and Jask. On her way back the boat seized three sailing boats in Sirik and brought them in tow to Bandar Abbas. Two of them which belonged to Arabs and believed to have been weather-bound were released and the third being of a Persian nationality and having cargo of 38 bags of rice from Oman ports was confiscated.5 2. Justice .—The Law Court, Bandar Abbas is expected to re-open in the beginning of October 1932. Policeman were seen busy inspecting letters and post books on September 5th. 122. Miscellaneous. 1. Mails from Germany are being still censored at the Post Office, Bushire. 2. Two Parsees from Bombay arrived at Bnshire on the 25th September 1932 and left for Tehran after two days stay. E. H.

(б) Persian Officials .— Yawar Ismail Khan Qawami, Chief of the Police De partment, Bushire, left Bushire on the 7th August for Shiraz where he intends to remain a short time. On the 18fch August, Muhammad Aqa Fatuwwat arrived at Bushire and relieved Anjaw-i-Zadah as Security Officer. The latter reverted to his substantive post of Assistant Security Officer. Dr. Inayetuliah Khan arrived here on the 19th August as Assistant Health and Quarantine Officer. On the 17bh August Aqai Badii arrived from Tehran, and assumed charge of the post of Head of the Census Department, Bushire. 93. HEALTH OF THE PERSIAN PORTS. The health of the Persian Ports has been good during the month under review. 94. CONDITION OF ROADS. Bushire Local Roads .—The repairing of the road from the town to Dastab has not yet been completed. Progress is naturally slow as the labourers are paid on daily rates and have no incentive to hurry. Bushire-Lingah Road .—The road has been laid out up to Lavar. The Governor of the Ports recently motored to Lavar and stated on return that he did the distance of about 60 miles in 5 hours, while formerly it took 4 or 5 days on foot or donkeys. Bandar Abbas-Kerman Road .—Motor traffic was resumed from the 1st August, but the road is in need of repairs. 95. RUSSIAN INTERESTS. Mr. Garksy Satooroff, the Russian Consul at Ahwaz arrived at Bushire on the 14th, and left for Shiraz on the 15th. On the 6th August, the Police arrested one Aqa Thabiti, Head peon of the Russo-Persian Bank, Bushire Branch on the suspicion that he was working as a Russian spy. On searching bis house, the Police seized certain documents which are alleged to incriminate him. This man is an ez-employee of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Abadan. He has been sent to Shiraz pending further investigation. In Shiraz he is living at the Fars Hotel. On the night of the 21st and 22nd August the cement godown of the Russian Vanishtorg caught fire. This godown is in the Kazerun’s old garage near the premises of the Imperial Bank of Persia. The fire was soon extinguish ed, and loss was negligible. The incident caused considerable anxiety to the Director of Customs, who feared that the Russian piecegoods godown might also catch fire and there by affect Customs responsibility. 96. FRENCH INTERESTS. M. Cassin, the French Consul, Bushire, left for Shiraz in the end of July. 97. MILITARY. Corrigendum .—Reference paragraph of July. In the last but one line please read Rials 16,000 for Rials 160,000.2 r r Lieutenant Amir Husain Khan, Officer Commanding the Amniah in Dashti, has been arrested for mis-appropriating Rials 120,000 of the pay and wages of the men under his command. Early in the month the grain sellers went on strike, and closed their shops as a protest against the Municipality rates. The Municipality had to modify their published rates. 98. CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY. A h ibkuh Reg ion ^Disturbances. —Refer ence paragraph 02of July. It is stated in official circles that Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Khalfan of Teben has been surrounded by troops, and that he has reiterated his professions of loyalty to the Government and his readiness to pay revenues. But general opinion is that the Shaikh is too clever to be caught napping, and that he will either be killed fighting or escape to the Arab Coast. The exact position is obscure. 99. LOCAL GOVERNMENT. Customs Preventive Department .—On the 29th August the preventive staff seized 23 bags of sugar which were being smuggled to the Jufrah village near the aerodrome. As smuggled sugar can be had at cheaper rates even the Military, Amniah, and Police connive at the smuggling operations, and seizures are therefore very few and far between. Municipality .—The Municipality ob tained from the Red Lion and Sun Society funds about Ts, 2,500 to supply water to the poor, but by the middle of August this amount had been expended and the free distribution of water to the poor was stopped. The Governor is try ing to raise subscriptions from the merchants to enable the Municipality to continue this distribution of water' till the end of September. As usual it is very doubtful if the whole money was truly expended on water. 100.—ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. Reference paragraph of July. There is no improvement in the econo mic depression. Poor people’s distress has been aggravated by the steppage of free distribution of water by the Munici pality. B irley which was sold last year at about lb Rials per Hashim Maund (16 Tabriz Maunds), is now sold at about 45 Rials. Wheat is also getting dearer. Eodder is practically unobtainable. 101.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. jf $ Jask. —Reference paragraph 4P of July. Mir Chiragh, Moham Khan, son of Mir Hoti, and Azam Khan,, son of Mustafa Khan returned to the district via Kuh-i- Mubarak on the 25th July, with 45 followers. They joined forces with Murad Khan and camped near Gagain 13 miles from Jask. Their joint followino 1 numbered about 245 armed men. They summoned from Bashkard Abdul Husain, who has a following of about 200 men* to meet them at Luh. On the 9th of August the Persian garrison in Jask was rather weak, there being only 29 soldiers at Jask, and about 40 in Old Jask. On the 17th August the Clerk in Charge, Imperial and International Com munications, Limited, Station at JasK reported as follows: “Reported 10 p.m. yesterday Old Jask surrounded and captured by followers of Murad Khan and Chiragh Khan with 260 strong.

On the 23rd the Clerk in charge re ported the following details: “It now transpires that the village was captured by Murad Khan alone with 120 men, Chiragh being left with 120 men to guard their camp. Roughly 1,000 Tumans was robbed and 35 cattle and 7 sheep taken away by the invaders. The sequence of events after this was as follows :— 18th—05-00 Jask evacuated bv Murad. 05-30 Murad arrived at Tash. kan, about 6 miles distance.08-00 Chiragh despatched to Yakdar, our first telephone station to collect food to be stored at Luh.

Their forces are divided and Murad is now encamped with the main bodj of about 180 at Kanian, about 12 miles east of Jask. Murad has again sent word to Abdul Husain informing him that hostilities having commenced he should join. A launch arrived from Bandar Abbas on th A 21st with Naib Jaaffar Khan and 50 soldiers to re inforce Old Jask. All people leaving Jask are now T being subjected to drastic cross-examination by the Police/’ On the 30th August the Clerk in charge reported that the Persian troops stationed at Old Jask had followed Murad and Chiragh as far as Luh, where thev surrounded some huts containing women and children. They recovered some useless rifles from the huts. The present whereabouts of Murad and Chiragh have not yet been definitely established, but there is a strong rumour that the former has gone to Arabia and the latter is in biding in the Gabrig hills. On the 25th August s. s. “ Baroda ” brought to Jask about 200 soldiers from Charbar, and some more were expected. Charbar .—According to a report dated Charbar, the 22nd August, there are dis turbances in Qasr-i-Qand, Geh, and the interior of Baluchistan. The Baluchis are fighting among themselves. There is general unemployment in Charbar and in Dashtiyari, and many residents have already left for Gwadur. 102. BANDAR ABBAS. Customs. — On the 8th August, the Customs launch “Gilan” on her way from Jask seized three sailing boats near Sirik, and brought them to Bandar Abbas.

Local Government. la) Customs Preventive Department. guo-ar and other contraband goods continue to be smuggled in by sailing boats. On the 5th July the Persian boat “ Azerbaijan ” rounded up two Tangis- tani sailing boats. One ol them was returning to Kuwait with cash, and the other was coming in with piece-goods from Bahrain. The Qasim Ah, former, escaped, but the latter, Husain Jabir, was^ arrested after he had been wounded and had thrown his cargo of piece-goods and his two rifles into the sea. As smuggled goods can be had at cheaper rates Td §g as ley are required by every body, even the Police, the Amniyah Guards, and the Military soldiers and officers, con nive with the smugglers and let thfem carry on their business comapratively und turbed. (b) Encouragement to the Persian Government have sanctioned the proposal of the Governor of the Ports to grant certain facilities to the divers of the Persian Coast to import hitherto contraband goods. On the 15th July the Governor received the following telegraphic mstructionsjrom the Ministry of Commerce, Tehr . “ In conformity with the decision con- nected with frontier barters, each j: in the Persian Coast can import twice a year (against their exports from Persia for which Certificates of export are not issued nor undertakings taken for the^ sale of the relative foreign exy change) each time to the value of Rials 500, dates; rice and other food stuffs, which form their ordi nary food, and which are difficult to provide in Persia. Import per mits are not necessary for these things. ” . f. : ; ’ “ The divers can also bring in an un limited number of Rupees against vgpeueBaW’ their exports.” The idea is to attract pearl divers to the Kharq Island pearl beds. 87 Economic Conditions. Reference paragraph 76 of June 1932. The economic depression is acute. The price of cereals has risen. The authorities are trying to control the price of sale without previously making adequate arrangements for supply. Bread has become dearer and inferior in quality, and this has caused distress and un easiness among the poor. Some rain is reported to have fallen in Tangistan and Dashti during the month, but not sufficient to affect the situation. Barley is scarce and other fodder un procurable. 88 Persian Baluchistan. r ask. —Reference paragraph 80 of June ;2, and 69 of May 1932. a) Concession Area. —The new Customs use within the old Indo-European Tele- ph Department concession area has been npleted and has been occupied by the dir. Saiyid Hassan is busy erecting a second ilding to the west of the New Customs ,use also within the concession area. b) Raids. —On the 5th July two Balu- s Paizullah and Lahdad, sons of one irad Shah, accompanied by 10 arpied lowers, raided Laffing, near Old Jask, and Tied away a flock of sheep, 4 camels and jows, but a detachment of Persian troops rsued them and recovered the booty. On the 7th July one AH, the brother of e guard Jan Muhammad Hoti, having ha Xcation with his pother, cut both of serial and International Commumca ms Company’s wires in several places, on tr side of Sedich, and refused to allow to cut3 tlie lines up to Gabrig, a distance of about 20 miles. The Officer-in-Charge, Imperial and International Communications Com- mny, then reported the matter to the Mili- Officer, Jask, who arrested the mis creant Ali at Sedich on the 11th July, and put him in prison pending trial at Kerman. His arms were seized. The last report dated 1st August 1932 says he was still in custody at Jask. Murad Khan, and Abdul Nabi and 17 followers who had gone to Oman, returned via Koh-i-Mubarak, and are now at Tash- kan, 8 miles from Old Jask. They wish to sell their belongings and to return to Arabia. On the 12th July one Ahmad Ramadhan, Baluchi, was killed because he declined to join the followers of Mir Chiragh against the Persians. On the 20th July one Mirook, a Baluchi, was murdered at Yakdar by two of Murad Khan’s men who were sent to escort him to Murad. Mirook attempted to stab one of his escort so was promptly shot dead. Murad Khan called up the Telegraph Office at Jask from Yakdar on their tele phone and enquired about Barkat Khan. He was informed that the Officer-in-Charge knew nothing about that chief but that it was believed that he was still alive. Mir Chiragh Mohim Khan, son of Mir Hoti, and Azam Khan, son of Mustafa Khan, returned to Jask district via Kuh-i-Mubarak on the 25th June 1932 with 45 followers. They have joined forces with Murad Khan and are camping at Gagain about 13 miles from Jask. Their joint following number about 132 armed men. It is believed that they have summoned Abdul Husain from Bashkard, where he has a following of about 200 men. Chiragh and Murad Khans are again harassing the people by extorting money from them. The latter fined two men of Laffing sixty Tumans each because they reported to the Persian Military that their flocks had been robbed. Both these two bandits then commenced extorting money from nearly all the wealthier residents of the district. The Persian Assistant Engine Driver of the Imperial and International Communications, Ltd., Jask (a Perisan subject), received a letter from Murad Khan on the 30th June 1932 ordering him to col lect 200 Tumans and to remit it to him quickly, but -no action was taken on it. The Persian garrison at Jask is not strong. There are only 29 soldiers stationed at J ask and 20 in the fort at Old Jask, but it is rumoured that reinforcements are expect ed to reach there shortly.

This was done the next morning and the effects handed over to the local representative of the Imperial Airways. 90. Kerman. Meteorological .—After a spell of very sultry weather, heavy rains of a tropical nature fell in the whole province of Kerman on the night of the 16th/17th July causing heavy floods all around. About 150 nouses in the eastern quarter of the town were damaged by floods from the Sar-i-Asiab slopes (East of the town) and a number of qanats damaged. News began to come in on the 17th of serious damages having been caused in the surrounding districts and villages. The village of Muhan, 18 miles South-East of Kerman as the crow flies, and 24 miles by motor road, suffered very heavily. Its supplies were cut off and a number of lives were dost. As heavy rains continued off and on for several days, they caused more floods in the Province, and information began to reach the local authorities of wide-spread sufferings among the inhabitants of the areas aflected. A heavy flood from Mahun on the 19th was averted with great effort otherwise the Southern quarter of the town would have been completely under water. A great panic prevailed throughout the following week, and though the danger of further floods has for the time been averted the oppressive weather still continued to the end of the month. * The Governor-General who deserves great commendation for his indefatigable efforts throughout the past anxious week, esti mates the total damage to the province being in the vicinity of 10 Million Tumans and comprising that to 524 qanats damaged out of a total of about 3,000 in the pro vince, 500 houses and half the season s crops. It is believed that some 100 or 200 lives have been lost, but definite in formation in this respect has not as yet been received. News of the floods throughout Persia are being received, but the Governor- General thinks that the Kerman provincehas suffered nost. According to His Ex cellency, His Majesty the Shah has con tributed 50,000 Tumans for the sufferers of the Kerman province, while subscription for their relief have been started in other provinces also. The effect of the above floods is already noticeable as good quality wheat, which was obtainable at Rials 160 a Kharvar, is practically unobtainable, w^hile the more inferior grades, in may cases from previous years’ stocks and somewhat spoiled by insects, are at the present moment being sold at Rials 200 to 220 a Kharvar. The fact of the landowners having incurred heavy losses in one direction on account of their crops and in another by the damage done to their qanats is sure to re-act detrimentally on trade in general, and to increase the cost of living. The Shah is said to have telegraphed to the Governor- General ordering that the landowners should be forced to repair their qanats even though they may have to sell their belong ings to meet their required expenditure. The landowners’ request to the Governor- General for the loan of the funds lying with the National Bank of Persia on account of the spinning mill project has been refused. The forecast in the province is gloomy as there is a scarcity of grain at the beginning of the harvest and prices are rising steadily. The landowners have no ready cash, on the contrary they will be unable to pay the interest due on large advances already re ceived by them from Local Parsi traders. The carpet industry, the chief source of livelihood for the Kerman people, shows no sign of improvement. for British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire ; The 26th August 1932.

Bushire-Shiraz Road. —The road is being improved slowly. Gangs are continually working on it and it is reported to be in excellent condition as far as the surface is concerned. £HGL0SURE IN I FOREiSN SECRET*^ 9 | ,o l-tS «• 8 AUG. 1932 ,5 SEP.

Its further course lias not yet been decided upon. The road, if it is ever completed, will un doubtedly be of great military value, and will help in the prevention of smuggling. 73. British Interests. King's Birthday. —-The Hon’ble the Political Besident held a reception in the morning of the 3rd June in the Town Besi- dency in honour of the King’s Birthday which was attended by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, the French Consul, Assistant Governor, Chief of the Police, Director of Customs, Belgian Special Inspector of Cus toms, the German Manager and Assistant of the National Bank of Persia and about 30 leading Persian merchants, and all British and Indian subjects. The local Soviet Trade Agency “ VENI- SHTOBG ” were not invited, as they have made no attempt to start friendly relations with the Besidency nor with the Colony. In the evening a dinner was given at Sabzabad, the Governor and Director of Customs together with the British Colony being invited. Usual receptions were held in the Agencies, Sub-Offices, and Subordi nate Consulates. 74. Local Government. (a) Governor of the Ports. —The News paper “ Kushish ” of Tehran published a report that Aqa Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Taliqani, Governor of the Ports, had been offered the post of Assistant to Minister of of Interior. His Excellency has contra dicted this news and stated that he pre ferred to be a Governor in a more or less2 independent position rather than an Assistant to a Minister. (b) Customs.—Early in the month, the Customs Tofangchis (night watchmen) were replaced by regular Amniyah guards. On the 13th June, a few Customs Inspectors accompanied by armed Amniyah guards, raided the drapers’ shops in the bazaars and seized all stocks of certain fancy foreign piece-goods, classified as prohibited im ports. Some private houses were also searched. This caused considerable excite ment in the town, and the drapers closed their shops for a day as a protest and com plained to the higher authorities. The Governor assured them that he would do his best to get the piece-goods returned to them. Subsequently he decided with the concur rence of the local Judge that the Customs had no right to search shops and houses, a function that belonged exclusively to the Police. The Customs, however, state they receiv ed definite orders from Tehran to seize all articles such as foreign silks found Tn shops, on the ground that such articles can only have been smuggled into the country. It is now for the merchants to prove the bona fide possession of these silks. By the close of the month, the goods had not been returned to the owners, and the whole matter has been referred to Tehran. Aqa Habibullah Khan Behruzi, Director of Customs, proceeded to Tehran on the 23rd June on 3 months sick leave. Monsieur Vandenrydt now holds charge of the Cus toms in addition to his own of Special Inspector (against smuggling). Behruzi’s departure is much regretted as he is a most obliging and courteous official. (c) Post .— Under orders from Tehran all newspapers arriving from Germany are examined by the Police in the Post Office before delivery. (d) Municipality .— Endeavours are be ing made to increase the Municipal income and a new Municipal tax 3 per cent, on the rental value of the houses has been introduced which will be collected by the Revenue Department staff. 75. Conditions of Country. (a) Bushire District Insecurity—On the night of the 23rd June, an Amniyah party came into contact with some armed robbers near AHMADI, between Bushire and Borazjan. In the fighting that ensued 4 Amniyah guards were killed and 3 wounded. Re-inforcements of about 50 Amniyah guards were sent out from Bahmani (Bushire) and succeeded in collecting two prisoners. By the end of the month the main party of robbers had not been rounded up. On the 29th June, a flock of sheep that was grazing near Borazjan was carried away' 1 *^ Reference paragraph 40^of April. The Amniyah arrested two of the men con cerned in the attack upon a car between Bushire and Dilwar on the 27th April in which two passengers were killed. Both have been sentenced to death by the Mili tary Court. (b) ShibJcuh Region. Disturbances. —Re- / ference paragraph^(6) of May. Rumours / reached Bushire in the last week of June that Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Khal- fan had returned to the Persian Coast with about 200 armed followers and re-occupied Assalu and its suburbs by driving out the Amniyah, and that he is now preparing to occupy TAHIRI. Shaikh Hatim, Shaikh of Tahiri, who was one of the 14 Arab Shaikhs of the Shibkuh region taken to Tehran last year by the Military, has been released. He arrived in Bushire on the 25th June and left for Tahiri on the 30th. He has been sent back to fight against Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Khalfan. (c) Government Measures. Wholesale Mutations .— As the result of the enquiries and reports of the local Persian authorities that the sons of Shaikh Husain of CHAH- KOTAH and Shaikh Muhammad Husain of Borazjan have been, directly or indi rectly, responsible for the disturbances and robberies in the Bushire district, the Per sian Government have decided that they and any others implicated should be re moved from the district for good. Steps are now being taken to have their immov able properties in CHAHKOTAH, AHMA DI, BULLAK and Borazjan valued with a view to granting them properties to the same value in the neighbourhood of Tehran. This decision was followed by some thefts in Borazjan town. The Majlis Deputies Mirza Ali Kazeruni and Shaikh Ali Dashti (Shafq-i-Surkh) are trying their best to have the orders rescinded. The former is related to the sons of Shaikh Husain and the latter is interested in Shaikh Muhammad Husain of Borazjan. It is understood that the Persian Gov ernment is taking similar action against all headmen of tribes in the Gulf littoral which have been recalcitrant and trouble some.76. Economic Conditions. The economic conditions are steadily going from bad to worse. But for the private charities the poorer Population would starve. Haji Muhammad Baqir and other merchants have been giving doles to the poor. Tickets are issued by them for the free daily supply of bread. Their kindness however only relieves a minute portion of the general distress. At the end of the month, the news that the Government has sanctioned immediate construction of Bushire-Lingah Road came as a welcome rehef, and thousands of the poor who had flocked in from the out lying district immediately left the town to work on the road. The Governpr informs me that labourers are receiving 3 Rials per diem, but from this is deducted the cost of getting food and water to them. They should eventually receive 1-25 to 1-50 Rials a day in cash. The prices of cereals are no lower and although the Municipality attempt To fix rates, they cannot compel shopkeepers to sell at them. The news from Shiraz and Kazerun that the crops are not barely half of normal has removed all hopes of a fall in prices. The Governor is endeavouring to import good wheat from Kirmanshah wdilraq. He calculates to get it to Bushire for 20 Tomans a Kharwar as against the present charge of 24 Tomans a Rahrwar (100 Tabriz Maunds). 77. Mohammerah.

Many families have left and are camping about half mile from the Telegraph office. Further reports from Task show that Mir Chiragh, son of Mustafa Khan, left Jagin for Suwaiq (Oman) on the 1st April. He was accompanied by 17 armed followers. Mies Chiragh intends to join Shaikh Hamad bin Hilal, who lives near Suwaiq. Murad and Abdun Nabi also intends to emmigrate to Arabia. Bandar Abbas received reports that the newly established Customs Posts between Jask and Serik were being raided by the Biyabanis. One of the Customs watch men who attempted to defend himself was killed near Jask and the rest found safety in evacuating the posts. Sarhang Abbas Khan Alburz hanged 5 followers of Sardar Mir Barkat Khan (now under Custody at Tehran) including Barkat Khan’s father-in-law on the charge of instigating people to loot the Customs Houses. This action of the Military has further enraged the Biyabanis. The Biyaban's’ night raids have caused 300 casualties to the Military. ... Sarhang Abbas Khan A burz returned tc Bandar Abbas from Biyaban on the 1 8th March and left for Kerman on the 11th. Yawer Ismail Khan is nowin Comma' of the troops in Biyaban.

Oncufry Stolboun, Soviet Consul- General for Fars, arrived at Bushire from Shiraz on the 13th February to organize the Russian Commercial Agency “ Venish- torg ”. He returned to Shiraz after a week’s stay. Whilst here, he called on H. B. M.’s Con sul-General at Sabzabad: the Political Resident could not return the call owing to indisposition. He also called on the Governor, who re turned the call at the Russian Consulate building outside the town. Monsieur BozanoS, Inspector General of the Sharq Company, arrived at Bandar ’Abbas from Tehran via Kerman on the 10th February and returned by the same route on the 14th. The Monopoly for the import of sugar and matches by the Russians was brought into force from the 1st Isfand (21st February 1932). The Russian Consul, Ahwaz, visited Mohammerah on the 22nd February and returned to Ahwaz on the 24th. British Interests. 17. In accordance with instructions from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran as a result of renewed insistence on the part of the Persian Government that flags should not be flown from flagstaffs planted in the ground, the two flagstaffs at Bushire town and Sabzabad Residencies ceased to be used for the flying of flags as from the 22nd February. New flagstaffs having been erect ed on the respective roofs flags were rehoist ed and flown on the 24th February. The main mast of the Town Residency flagstaff has been left in situ as it carries the beacon by which the entrance to the inner anchor age is found by ships at sea. At Bandar Abbas a similar arrangement is in force. The original flagstaff has been left standing as it is of use to ships entering the harbour. The Imperial and International Cornmu-^ nications Company’s flagstaffs at Bushire (Reshire), Henjam, Jask and Charbar have been dismantled. fp Condition of Country. Insecurity. 18. During the first week of February, a motor lorry on its way from Shiraz to Bushire, was attacked by armed dacoits tNOLOSUHc IN NO!A FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter No S 1. M. Datef 28APR.1932 Ree i sa 1 5 MAY. &lt;3322 at a place called Isavand, a small village near Borazjan on the Bushire side and Tumans 500 and a bale of carpets were looted. The latter was eventually recovered by Amniah guards. On the 13th February a shop keeper in the bazaar was relieved of Tumans 50 in broad daylight. The thief made good his escape. On the 14th February the Bushire-Shiraz Postal van carrying mails and passengers from Bushire to Shiraz was attacked by armed dacoits at a place called Gaz Buland, 3 miles on the Bushire side of Borazjan. One of the passengers, a Tehrani Accountant of the National Bank of Persia was killed and of the Amniah guards, one was killed and the other wounded. Mails were also tampered with. According to an official version, two of the dacoits were also wound ed, but were carried away by the raiders. It is feared that this insecurity may increase as the economic distress of the population grows greater. Two robberies are reported from Moham- merah. A band of about 20 armed robbers attacked the village of Soreh on the night of 5th/6th February and looted 9 houses. Two villagers were killed. On the night of 7th/8th another band of armed men attacked the village of Mamuri, about a mile north of Mohammerah, and looted 4 houses of villagers including two owned by a British Vice-Consulate watch man and his brother. The Amniah have not yet traced the robbers. Military. 19. (a) Conscription .—The “ Nizam-i- Wazifah ” Office was closed at Bushire at the end of February. (6) 'Expedition. —Reference paragraph 122 of December 1931. Early in the month, the force of about 800 soldiers under Yayar Poor-i-Rustagar, which had been disarming the tribesmen in Tangistan and Dashti, proceeded onward to the Shibkuh region to re-inforce the troops operating against Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Khalfan and his confederates. It appears that since his return from Bahrain and Hasa to Teben, Shaikh Muhammad has revived his activi ties with increased vigour. He is said to have occupied Shiyu. The fact that re-inforcements have been called for is significant and soldiers from the plateau are not likely to accomplish much during the summer in that notoriously warm region. Two Military Officers, who were deputed by Shiraz Headquarters to inspect the Shibkuh area returned to Shiraz in the first week of February. Local Government. 20. The President of the Bushire Munici pality Saiyid Husain Siadat has been im plicated in a case in which a local petty merchant connived with the Customs Mudir at Rudhillah to get 50,000 Rials worth of false export Jawazes. Economic conditions. 21. The entire failure of rains during the winter, has caused scarcity of water, fodder and grain. The Municipality are trying to make arrangements with contractors to supply drinking water from Mohammerah. Fodder and barley are unobtainable and the cattle are slowly starving. The price of cereals has trebled. Shiraz and Kazerun Municipalities have prohibited the export of cereals to Bushire as there also crops are short. The Governor has approached Tehran to allow the unrestricted import of cereals from India or ’Iraq. This shortage added to the economic distress caused by the Import, Monopoly and Exchange Laws has further shaken well established firms. The leading firm of Haji Muhammad Reza Kazeruoni and Sons is reported to be in serious financial difficulty but creditors are combining to prevent a crash. The cost of living has increased but earnings have lessened. Labourers cannot find any work. The Government is not apparently con templating any relief works. Kerman. (a) British Interests. 22. The last of the Hindu traders is leaving Kerman. These traders established them selves there some 113 years ago and for a time employed their own Mail couriers to and from Bandar ’Abbas. Before the new trade Monopoly regulations they con trolled the import trade but have one by one left the place during the past few years. Their departure is much regretted by the Local traders, as with their departure their credit system for shopkeepers and others has stopped. When the new trade regulations came into force, these Hindus had outstandings in the bazaar to the extent of over six lakhs of Rupees on account of goods sold on long terms.Kerman trade continues to remain very dull and is now mainly in the hands of Yezdi traders. The piecegoods now in use are mostly Russian. Tehran supplies woollen, silken, and all fancy fabrics. 2. The house of a certain Mirza Darwish of Bam was searched by the Police autho rities at Bam on the 26th January and Mirza Darwish himself despatched to Ker man under guard together with papers found in his house. He was formerly a Munshi in the British Vice-Consulate at that place, but since its closing down had been employed by the Kerman Consulate as a news writer. It is believed that the weekly news letter posted by him just before his arrest has also been intercepted. (6) Russian Interests. The Soviet Trade Representation ^ in Kermrn gave an exhibition of their agricul tural tools and implements on the 7th January. Persian Baluchistan. 23. {a) Mir Barkat Khan, Chief of Bashkard district (Jask) and about ten others were brought to Bushire under Military guard on the 15th February and despatched to Tehran. (5) The Officer in Charge, Imperial and International Communications Company, Jask reports that 200 troops are busy collecting arms in the district. They left Jask on the 11th February and passed through Ekdar, Jagin and Gabrig. Very few rifles had been found. 30 soldiers have garrisoned Old Jask. Mustafa Khan, who is now in Bashkard, is said to have ordered his sons Morad, Chiragh, ’Abdul Nabi and Azam and his nephew Mir Hossein to harass those Balu chis who aided the Persian Troops and several villages have been attacked. On the 31st January the Customs Launch “ Azerbaijan ” brought to Bandar ’Abbas 1,220 rifles, which are said to have been collected from Mir Barkat Khan’s tribes men and followers in Biyaban. Bandar ’Abbas. British Interests. 24. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited.—Dr. G. H. Lees, the Chief Geologist of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, accom panied by Messrs. Shaw and White arrived at Bandar ’Abbas from Abadan on the 22nd January and left in the Company’s Motor boat for the Clearance Strait, where they propose to prospect the kerosine oil on the mainland. Mr. A. R. Pitt of the same Company, arrived there at the same time and opened a sub-office on the 1st of February. Messrs. S. Derabji &amp; Co. who used to sell Com pany’s goods have handed over the stock to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Agent. Following the retrenchment of the post of Sub-Assistant Surgeon, British Consul- late, Bandar ’Abbas, the Charitable Dis pensary in the town was closed down on the 23rd January. Minab. 25. Deputy Governor s Conduct. —Reference paragraph 176 of December 1931. Ali Khan Azad, Deputy Governor of Minab, was suspended for improper conduct with the wife of Shaikh Ahmad Gelladari, an important merchant at Bandar ’Abbas. He then eloped with her but the both were arrested at Sirj an and the case is being tried by the Kerman Courts. Lingah. 26. Lar-Lingah Motor Road. —The work on this road is in progress and it is expected that it will be opened on the Persian New Year’s Day (21st March 1932). Mohammerah. 27. (a) National Bank of Persia. —Under instructions from Tehran, the Governor- General of Khuzistan arrived at Mohamme- rah from Ahwaz on the 17th February to enquire into the trouble between the Mana-, ger of the National Bank, N. Vender Borch (German), and his Head Clerk Mirza Ahmad Khan Nimazi. It appears that one of the Bank clerks by name Naji had accused Nimazi of stealing a pencil. Both were called by the Manager and while the matter was being enquired into, Nimazi slapped Naji. The Manager then lost his temper and kicked Nimzi out of the office. There upon Nimazi slapped the Manager. Mr. Borch dismissed Nimazi for being disres pectful. The local merchants telegraph ed to Tehran protesting against the dis missal of Nimazi. Tehran has reinstated Nimazi pending the Governor-General’s report. (b) Arms and Ammunition. —59 cases of arms and spare parts arrived at Moham merah from Germany on the 1st February by German ship “ Woolsburg ”. The Officer Commanding, Troops, took delivery and despatched them to Tehran. (c) Municipality. —The Central Govern ment has approved the Municipal Budget for Abadan and Mohammerah for Persian Year 1311 for Kraus 300,000 and Krans4 210,000 respectively. These amounts will be collected as Baldiyah tax. (d) Dredging of Bahmanshir .—On the 21st February, the Governor of Moham- merah under orders from Tehran engaged about 1,500 men to dredge the Bahmanshir river so as to enable sailing craft to reach the Karun river direct from G USB AN and so avoid paying any dues to the ’Iraq Government. It remains to be seen whether it will be possible to effect this by manual labour and also to avoid subsequent silting up of the channel. (e) British Interests .—A British Indian subject Dr. J. P. Bhatt has purchased the Pharmacy at Mohammerah belonging to Mirza r Ali Akbar Behat and has opened as a Dispensary on the 2nd February. (/) Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan .—Mirza Husain Khan Muwaqqar, a Deputy for Mohammerah in the Majlis at Tehran, ar rived at Mohammerah from Tehran via Traq by air on the 7th February.

Aqa Habinullah Khan Bahroozi, Provincial Director of the Southern Customs, accords the people good treatment and is doing conspicuous service to the Government. Such an honest and painstaking official has never been posted to Bushire. ” There is no doubt about it that the present Director is infinitely pleasanter to meet and better to deal with than his Belgian predecessors of whom M. P. Woltcrs excelled in unpopularity and unscrupulou sness. 8. Military.

On the December 1931 the Persian Officials seized the boat and its cargo and arrested the crew. They also attempted to disarm the Assyrian levies and had it not been for the presence of one of His Majesty’s ships at Hen jam a serious incident would probably have occurred.

The Colonel’s task is under stood to be the completion of the dis armament of these tribes which not so numerous as the Qashqais are spread over a wide area in the southern parts of Fars. Lt.-Col. Shakir Khan, Tabatahai arri ved at Shiraz on the 21 th September from Tehran to take over the post of II Khani cf the Qashqais in place of Malik Mansur Khan, son of Soulatmd-Doulah. The former II Khani returned to Tehran. The new 11 Khani is well spoken of and with tact may succeed in gaining the tribe’s confidence more readily than the previous II Khani who being a member of Souiat-ud-Doulah’s family had many enemies in the tribe. Among the many problems which the new Official will have to deal with are the question of the proposed abandonment of tribal mig ration and the question of disarma ment. Soulat-ud-Doulah (Ismail Khan Qashqai) is in Tehran and is said to be under suspicion of having incited the outlaw Mehdi Surki, who was hanged at Shiraz on the 18th May last.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company t Limited* —Mr. T. I. Jacks, Resident4 Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany, Limited, arrived from Tehran by air on the 19th and returned on the 24th. II.

The Afghan Government ha s approached the Persian Government with a request for the loan of the service 8 of a few carpet weaving experts and the Governor-General was asked by Tehran to send in a list of the names of suitable candidates. In so doing His Excellency has represented that such action would be detrimental to the interests of the Persian carpet industry. 2. During the month of September th e Governor-General issued oiders calling upon the -women of Kerman to drop the use of white 4 chadars ’ (cloaks) and replace them by black. After the ex piry of this period, the local policemen will have orders to sprinkle some sort of colour on white chadars if worn. It may be mentioned that only in Yezd and Kerman are 4 chadars ’ in common use. The action of the Governor-Gt-neral is resented by the inhabitants of Kerman who are for the most part too poor to afford the purchase of black chadars which have gone up in price considerably during the year. It is presumed that the above orders were issued for the purpose of effecting uniformity in wo men’s dress througout Persia. 147. Henjam. In accordance with orders from Bushiie, the Postmaster, Henjam, hand ed over the Deputy Governorship to the Head of the Police Department from the 23rd September. 148. Persian Baluchistan. 1. Jask. —(a) Arms Traffic .—Reference paragraph 100 (1) of 1931. Enquiries made by the Residency Agent, Sharjah, do not confirm the report sent by the Officer in-Charge, Telegraph, Jask. The Residency Agent reports and that Shaikhs of Baraimi and Abu Dhabi started fight ing amongst themselves on about the 4th June and consequently traffic bet ween Baraimi and Debai was entirely closed. No route remained open by which arms and ammunition coaid be brought to Debai from Baraimi and thence shipped to Bandar Abbas. The Trucial Coast Bodous are in the habit of scrapp ing amongst themselves and it is unlikely therefore that they can spare rifles for Persian Baluchistan. J. R. L.

' Six policemen who are involved in one of the thefts have been imprisoned in the Police lock-up.

District in Tangistan.— Two Amniah guards were killed in ALom in a fight with the inhabitants of Ahram village. Two highwaymen who were brought from Suraki, a village in Tangistan, on the 3r^ July are now in the Military prison, Bushire.

(c) An Amniah guard was killed on the 25th July in Madu Mari, a port in Tangistan coast, for having outraged the modesty of a girl. IV. Liravi.—The Liravi estate, a large tract of land situated about 100 miles to the north of Bushire, has become a source of unrest in the country. Two-thirds of the estate belongs to Haji Abdur Rasul Rais-ut- Tujjar, Bushire, and the remaining one- third is the property of Aqa Khan, the Chief of Liravi. In the past Haji Rais has al ways leased his share to Aqa Khan, but this year as the latter refused to agree to a rise in the rental, he leased it to Mohammed Ali Khan, brother of Aqa Khan, who has agreed to pay a higher figure. # This action on the part of Haji Rais was deeply resented by Aqa Khan and his friend Haidar Khan C. I. E. Zabit of Hiat Daud. They do not wish thxt Aqa Khan should lose his foothold in the estate, and also fear lest His Excellency Sards r-i-As’ad Bakh- tiari, the present Minister of War, should succeed in securing influence in the estate through the agency of Mohammed Ali Khan to whom he has leased Zaidun, a neighbour ing estate. They appealed to His Excellen cy Sardar Intisar who sent his Assistant, Muhammad Khan Zand to the spot to effect a settlement. Aqai Zand considers that Haji Rais should cancel his lease to Aqa Mohammad Ali Khan and lease his shares in the estate to his co-owner Aqa Khan Liravi for the amount which Mohammad Ali had agreed to pay. He brought the parties and Haidar Khan C.I.E. Zabit of Hiat Daud into Bushire and an attempt is being made to effect an amicable settlement on these lines. V. Shih-Kuh. —L Reference paragraph No. 92(e) of 1931. The thirteen sheikhs of Shib-Kuh and Ali Akbar Khan of Galladar on the 17 th July were sent from Shiraz to Tehran by car, the hire of which they were made to pay themselves. It is opined in Bushire that they will be detained in Tehran indefinitely.2. Sheikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Khal- fan (and not Sheikh Ahmad bin Muhammad K half an as stated in last month’s diary) is reported, on good authority, to be engaged on a large scale in the smuggling of sugar, tea, and haberdashery into the Shib-Kuh \ports from Bahrein. He has provided him self with two motor launches whose crew he has armed with rifles, and these act as an escort to the smuggler’s sailing boats bound for these ports. His activities however are not confined to smuggling. He has occupied Gav-bandi, the heaquartars of Sheikh Mazkur Khan, one of the thirteen sheikhs arrested and sent to Tehran, and according to Sheikh Mazkur’s agent in Bushire he has recently obtained some arms from the Trucial Oman with the view to waging war on the peasantry of the Shib-Kuh villages. Kazeruni’s motor launch was the object of an unfortunate accident at the beginning of the month. She arrived on her maiden voyage at Asalu where a party of the Sheikh’s men mistaking her fcr the Custom’s launch opened fire. 1 hough hit, she received luck ily no serious damage and was able to make good her escape.

On the 26th July, the owner of a garden in Borazjan caught an Amniah guard in the act of removing his water melons, and killed him. The murderer was arrested and brought to the Amniah barracks at Bahmani where he is now in prison pending arrival of orders from Shiraz about him. VII. Ahwaz Town. —During the month several robberies were committed in Ahwaz. Captain A. C. Gallaway’s house was robbed on the night of the 12th June and articles of personal jewelry were stolen. The Police investigations were carried out in a very half hearted manner and no trace was discovered either of the robber or of the property. 106. Tribal Affairs. Boir Ahmad .—On the 4th June, Mir Ghulam, a rebel of the Boir Ahmadi tribe, ■jvho has been in the past the cause of constant trouble in the country, was killed in a private squabble with Shkrullah Khan, who too lost his life in the fight.. MC457FD Mir Ghulam’s brother, Mir Nasrullah, was arrested and taken to Shiraz and sent to the gallows on the 2nd July. The area is swarming with brigands and it would be a mistake to presume that the Persian troops have any effective control over the Boir Ahmadi tribesmen and the Mamasami district. 107. Condition of Roads. Bushire-Shiraz Road. —On the 26th July two Amniah guards who were escorting a prisoner to Shiraz were attacked near a village named Jaafar Ginn situated bet ween Daleki and Rudak Pass by the rela tives of the prisoner.

Second Commission of Inspection. —A new Commission of Inspection consisting of the following persons :— Sarhang Salar, Aqai Moulavi, Aqai Sari Aslani, arrived at Bushire on the 22nd July. The Commission of Inspection, it is said by Persian Officials, has been sent to investi gate and report on, among other matters, the smuggling traffic. On the 23rd they posted a notice in the town calling for complaints. On the 26th July they left for Khormuj, and visited Borazjan on the 29th idem.' Their enqui ries in Bushire have been secret and nothing definite is known of their activities or in tentions. 109. Military. 1. Conscription ~-l. With the departure on. the 9th July of the Recruiting Officer from Bushire, the Conscription Bureau at Bushire was closed. 2. A Bushire recruit after throwing away his uniform deserted; he has not been traced.II. Accoutrements. —During June 1931 2400 cases of Military stores and equip ment other than arms and ammunition, arrived from Germany for the Persian Gov ernment. They were discharged at Bandar- i-bhapur and were despatched to Tehran in 90 lomes. III. Disarming Campaign. —During the early part of the month, 100 rifles and two machine guns, collected in Dashti, were brought into Bushire and delivered at the Military barracks. The two machine guns were captured last year from the troops. IV. Amniah. —1. On the 2nd July 30 Amniah guards sent to Lingah sometime ago returned to Bushire in the Customs launch “ Isfahan.” 2. On the 11th July 82 Amniah guards recruited in Bandar Abbas arrived here in the Azerbaijan ’ . Fifty were sent to Borazjan on 16th July. They have since been found unfit for service and are no match for the Dashtistams and Tangistanis. rhey are lacking in courage and among their number contains many opium smokers. During the month five deserted from barracks, of those one was found in the town and another in Behbehan ; both are now in prison. Their return to Bandar Abbas is contemplated. 3. On the 1st July a few villagers came in from Sirkuh (in Shabankareh) and lodged a complaint with Lieut. Ali Asghar Khan Vaziri, the Officer Commanding the Amniah Contingent, charging the guards stationed in their village with high-handedness. The Officer gave them a letter in which he admonished his men and ordered them to mend their ways in future. 4. Lieut. Ali Asghar Khan summoned Ahmad Khan Angali to Bushire and detain ed him in the Amniah prison for three days, This Khan had helped his villagers in re fusing to hand over an unlicensed gun which the Amniah guards had found. 110. Health and Quarantine 1 The health and Quarantine Depart ment, Bushire, has received a credit of Tomans 5,000 to pay Afrasiabi (the com pounder of the Charitable Hospital and owner of a private dispensary) for medicines supplied. 2. On the 25th July quarantine was de clared against Bombay where a death from cholera is reported. 3. On the 31st July quarantine was im posed against Basrah for cholera. Two coolies from here are supposed to have died from cholera in Basrah but no cases of cholera have been detected in Bushire town. M.C457FD HI Payment of Salaries. The Revenue Department, Bushire, has received instructions that the payment of salaries of Government establishments are to be effected with greater promptness than has been customary in the past, and with this end in view payments in future are to commence on the 26th and be completed by the end of the month. 112. Opium Tax. The banderole tax on opium sold in retail for smoking and medicinal purposes was reduced about the beginning of the month to half Krans per misqal. The tax collected on quantities exported from Persia remains the same as before. This reduction, it is said, was forced on the Government by the large quantities of opium that were being smuggled in and the consequent falling off in revenue rece pts. It is hoped that a lower rate of tax by re ducing the temptation to smuggle will actually result in larger receipts. 113. Posts and Telegraphs. The Postal Officials in Bushire have received instructions to open a school in the town for the training of Bushire youths in telegraph and postal routine work. It is intended that in future Persian Gulf vacancies in the Posts and Telegraphs should be filled by Bushiris thus avoiding the necessity of having to send men from the interior. The order also enjoins that, if necessary, a similar institution should be opened in Khuzistan but so far no steps have been taken into the matter. 114. Customs. Preventive Department. —1. On the 13th July a caravan of 16 donkeys carrying smuggled sugar succeeded in entering the town unmolested. This feat was per formed on a bribe of Tomans six to the policeman on duty to keep his eyes shut. 2. The Customs Preventive officials dur ing the month, caught some 14 bags of sugar and a bale of piece goods smuggled into Jofreh and Halailah. 3. They also caught two small sailing boats alleged to be bringing smuggled sugar and tea into Bushire district. The masters of the boats dropped their cargo overboard and when interrogated denied everything and protested that they had been out afish- ing. Their denial however did them no good, and they have been placed in the Police lock-up pending further enquiries, 115. Municipality. In the early part of the month the Municipality resumed work on widening and improving the streets in the bazaar.Several shops have been demolished and the streets are being roofed at the expense of the.shop owners. The local newspaper “ The Khalij-i-iran ” complained in one of its July issues of the inactivity of Sayed Husain Behbehani, President of the Council of Municipality, Bushire. It alleged that persons suffering from contagious diseases are allowed to sell food articles in the bazaar ; baths are not inspected ; no control is maintained over the market prices ; and finally the streets and thoroughfares are neither levelled nor metalled. Stirred by the above criticisms, the Muni cipality raised the municipal tax on hotels to Krans 60 each. This sent in the Hote 1 - keepers on strike who closed their hotels for two days; it was finally agreed that the tax should be fixed at Ts. 2 per month. 116. Persian Marine. The ship “ Khazaliah ” was sold to Mirza Jalal Bushiri for Krans 36,000. 117. National Bank of Persia, Mohammerah. Salim Niamani, Accountant of the Na tional Bank of Persia, Mohammerah, has misappropriated Krans 10,500. It is reported that in defending his action* he made the ingenious excuse that he took the money because he was hard up. As Salim was engaged by the Central Office, Tehran, the Manager has referred the matter to Headquarters. In the meantime he is employing him on clerical work in his own office room. 118. Persian Baluchistan. 1. Reference paragraph No. 100-1 of 1931. The officer in charge of Telegraphs, Jask, has since reported that there is no definite information indicating from which port in the Trucial Oman the arms were brought. But it is believed that they came from Baraimi in the interior. 2. Reference paragraph No. 100(3) of 1931. The Mudir of Customs, Bunji, has since been persuaded to return to Bandar Abbas. This shows that Mir Barkat is not willing to antagonise the Persian authorities by harbouring a fugitive from the law. 3. On the 14th July a Baluchi by name Abdur Rasul Abdul Nabi of Dastiar, entered the Customs office at Ganjan (Biaban), threatened the Mudir; took possession of Krans 460 hard cash, a magazine rifle, ammunition, customs seal and flag ; and made his escape with the booty. Owing to continued threats and robberies in Bahmadi and Bunji, the Mudirs of Customs there fled to Jask. They complain that it is unsafe for them to remain at their posts and continue their duties with a guard of only two farrashes provided by Mir Barakah Khan. Their colleague at Jask, however, persuaded them to return, and has represented their case to the Customs authorities in Bandar Abbas. 4. On the 22nd July 25 armed Tahirzais raided G rau and Bandaron. They plun dered 12 houses and set fire to 8 others. Before leaving, they seized the Kalantar of Girau, and shaved half his beard, one eye brow and half his head. This action, it is said, is a reprisal for a similar treatment meted out by Jalal, son of Mir Barkat Khan, to a Taherzai sometime back. Mir Barakat Khan has written to Chirag and Mordad sons, of Mustafa Khan and also to the Kalantas of Jagin, Gabrig and Sadech to collect men and join him at Guski. He intends taking vengeance on the Tahirzais. 5. According to news received by H. B. M.’s Consul, Kerman, early in June, detach ments from Iranshahr, Jiruft, Rudbar, Kuhistan and Bandar Abbas proceeded to Bashakird with the object of arresting Abdul Husain Khan, Kameran and dis arming that district. 6. Recruitment of conscripts in Bam began in June. It is reported that the recruiting officer has displayed undue severity in the execution of his work and even went so far as to prosecute youths serving in the Amniah and Police for evad ing enlistment. 119. Kerman. Local Interests .—His Excellency Mirza Reza Khan, Governor General, is ener getically pushing forward a scheme for the establishment of a Spinning Mill at Kerman. He has by threats succeeded in collecting the first instalment from the prospective shareholders, and it is said now he intends visiting Yezd where he hopes to persuade the traders to take up shares. He also wants the National Bank of Persia to participate in the enterprise. When the idea of a mill was first mooted, a sample of Ravfinjang cotton was sent to India to be tested as to its suitability. The report has not yet been received, so the Governor’s activities would appear to be premature. The Sharq Co.’s branch at Kerman has offered to supply the required machinery; but if the National Bank of Persia become shareholders, it is probable that the machi nery will be imported from Germany andbe worked by German Engineers. Al ready, a German firm on its own initiative has entered into correspondence with the Governor General on this subject. 120. Miscellaneous. Carrying trade between Bushire and sub ports. —I. Messrs. Haji Sayed Muhammad Keza Kazeruni and Sons, Bushire, in the beginning of the month launched their first motor dhow. It is intended for a passenger and a cargo service between Bushire and Lingah. She set out on her maiden voyage carrying cargo and passen gers for Aumori, Lavar, Daiyor and Lin gah, and returned on the 20th July. 121. The Health of the Port. The health of the Persian Gulf Ports was good during the month under review. J. B. L. BRADSHAW, for Ojfg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and H. B.

Liravi. —The Liravi estate, a large tract of land situated about 100 miles to the north of Bushire, has become a source of unrest in the country. Two-thirds of the estate belongs to Haji Abdur Rasul Rais-ut- Tujjar, Bushire, and the remaining one- third is the property of Aqa Khan, the Chief of Liravi. In the past Haji Rais has al ways leased his share to Aqa Khan, but this year as the latter refused to agree to a rise in the rental, he leased it to Mohammed Ali Khan, brother of Aqa Khan, who has agreed to pay a higher figure. This action on the part of Haji Rais was deeply resented by Aqa Khan and his friend Haidar Khan C. I. E. Zabit of Hiat Daud. They do not wish that Aqa Khan should lose his foothold in tlie estate, and also fear lest His Excellency Sardar-i-As’ad Bakh- tiari, the present Minister of War, should succeed in securing influence in the estate through the agency of Mohammed Ali Khan . to whom he has leased Zaidun, a neighbour ing estate. They appealed to His Excellen cy Sardar Intisar who sent his Assistant, Muhammad Khan Zand to the spot to effect a settlement. Aqai Zand considers that Haji Rais should cancel his lease to Aqa Mohammad Ali Khan and lease his shares in the estate to his co-owner Aqa Khan Liravi for the amount which Mohammad Ali had agreed to pay. He brought the parties and Haidar KhanC.I.E. Zabit of Hiat Daud into Bushire and an attempt is being made to effect an amicable settlement on these lines. V. Shib-Kuh. —1. Reference paragraph No. 92(e) of 1931. The thirteen sheikhs of Shib-Kuh and Ali Akbar Khan of Galladar on the 17th July were sent from Shiraz to Tehran by cat 1 , the hire of which they were made to pay themselves. It is opined in Bushire that they will be detained in Tehran indefinitely.1 0 2. Sheikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Khal- fan (and not Sheikh Ahmad bin Muhammad Rhalfan as stated in last month’s diary) ^ reported, on good authority, to be engaged on a large scale in the smuggling of sugar, tea, and haberdashery into the Shib-Kuh ports from Bahrein. He has provided him self with two motor launches whose crew he has armed with rifles, and these act as an escort to the smuggler’s sailing boats bound for these ports. His activities however are not confined to smuggling. He has occupied Gav-bandi, the heaquart3rs of Sheikh Mazkur Khan, one of the thirteen sheikhs arrested and sent to Tehran, and according to Sheikh Mazkur’s agent in Bushire he has recently obtained some arms from the Trucial Oman with the view to waging war on the peasantry of the Shib-Kuh villages. Kazeruni’s motor launch was the object of an unfortunate accident at the beginning of the month. She arrived on her maiden voyage at Asalu where a party of the Sheikh’s men mistaking her for the Custom’s launch opened fire. Though hit, she received luck ily no serious damage and was able to make good her escape. VI. Borazjan. —Reference paragraph No. 92(6) of 1931. The Amniah garrison at Borazjan on the 10th July killed one and arrested t wo of the gang of robbers who have been infesting the Borazjan-Daleki road since March 1931. 2.

Ahwaz Town. —During the month several robberies were committed in Ahwaz. Captain A. C. Callaway’s house was robbed on the night of the 12th June and articles of personal jewelry were stolen, i The Police investigations were carried out in a very half hearted manner and no trace was discovered either of the robber or of the property. 106. Tribal Affairs. Boir Ahmad .—On the 4th June, Mir Ghulam, a rebel of the Boir Ahmadi tribe, who has been in the past the cause of constant trouble in the country, was killed in a private squabble with Shkrullah Khan, who too lost his life in the fight. MC467FD Mir Ghulam’s brother, Mir Nasrullah, was arrested and taken to Shiraz and sent to the gallows on the 2nd July. The area is swarming with brigands and it would be a mistake to presume that the Persian troops have any effective control over the Boir Ahmadi tribesmen and the Mamasami district. 107. Condition of Roads. Bushire-Shiraz Road .—On the 26th July two Amniah guards who were escorting a prisoner to Shiraz were attacked near a village named Jaafar Ginn situated bet ween Daleki and Rudak Pass by the rela tives of the prisoner.

The Commission of Inspection, it is said by Persian Officials, has been sent to investi gate and report on, among other matters, the smuggling traffic. On the 23rd they posted a notice in the town calling for complaints. On the 26th July they left for Khormuj, and visited Borazjan on the 29th idem. Their enqui ries in Bushire have been secret and nothing definite is known of their activities or in tentions. 109. Military. I Conscription. —1. With the departure on the 9th July of the Recruiting Officer from Bushire, the Conscription Bureau at Bushire was closed. 2.

Accoutrements. —During June 1931 2400 cases of Military stores and equip ment other than arms and ammunition, arrived from Germany for the Persian Gov ernment. They were discharged at Bandar- i-Shapur and were despatched to Tehran in 90 lorries. HI Disarming Campaign. —During the early part of the month, ioo rifles and two machine guns, collected in Dashti, were brought into Bushire and delivered at the Military barracks. The two machine guns were captured last year from the troops. IV. Amniah. —1. On the 2nd July 30 Amniah guards sent to Lingah sometime ago returned to Bushire in the Customs launch “ Isfahan.” 2. On the 11th July 82 Amniah guards recruited in Bandar Abbas arrived here in the “ Azerbaijan ”. Fifty were sent to Borazjan on 16th July. They have since been found unfit for service and are no match for the Dashtistanis and Tangistanis. They are lacking in courage and among their number contains many opium smokers. During the month five deserted from barracks, of those one was found in the town and another in Behbehan ; both are now in prison. Their return to Bandar Abbas is contemplated. 3. On the 1st July a few villagers came in from Sirkuh (in Shabankareh) and lodged a complaint with Lieut. Ali Asghar Khan Vaziri, the Officer Commanding the Amniah : Contingent, charging the guards stationed in their village with high-handedness. The Officer gave them a letter in which he admonished his men and ordered them to mend their ways in future. 4. Lieut. Ali Asghar Khan summoned Ahmad Khan Angali to Bushire and detain ed him in the Amniah prison for three days. This Khan had helped his villagers in re fusing to hand over an. unlicensed gun which the Amniah guards had found. 110. Health and Quarantine 1. The health and Quarantine Depart ment, Bushire, has received a credit of Tomans 5,000 to pay Afrasiabi (the com pounder of the Charitable Hospital and owner of a private dispensary) for medicines supplied. 2. On the 25th July quarantine was de clared against Bombay where a death from cholera is reported. 3. On the 31st July quarantine was im posed against Basrah for cholera. Two coolies from here are supposed to have died from cholera in Basrah but no cases of cholera have been detected in Bushire town. MC457FD 111. Payment of Salaries. The Revenue Department, Bushire, has received instructions that the payment salaries of Government establishments aH to be effected with greater promptness than has been customary in the past, and with this end in view payments in future are to commence on the 26th and be completed by the end of the month. 112. Opium Tax. The banderole tax on opium sold in retail for smoking and medicinal purposes was reduced about the beginning of the month to half Krans per misqal. The tax collected on quantities exported from Persia remains the same as before. This reduction, it is said, was forced on the Government by the large quantities of opium that were being smuggled in and the consequent falling off in revenue rece pts. It is hoped that a lower rate of tax by re ducing the temptation to smuggle will actually result in larger receipts. 113. Posts and Telegraphs. The Postal Officials in Bushire ha ve received instructions to open a school in the town for the training of Bushire youths in telegraph and postal routine work. It is intended that in future Persian Gulf vacancies in the Posts and Telegraphs should be filled by Bushiris thus avoiding the necessity of having to send men from the interior. The order also enjoins that, if necessary, a similar institution should be opened in Khuzistan but so far no steps have been taken into the matter. 114. Customs. Preventive Department. —1. On the 13th July a caravan of 16 donkeys carrying smuggled sugar succeeded in entering the town unmolested. This feat was per formed on a bribe of Tomans six to the policeman on duty to keep his eyes shut. 2. The Customs Preventive officials dur ing the month, caught some 14 bags of sugar and a bale of piece goods smuggled into Jofreh and Halailah. 3. They also caught two small sailing boats alleged to be bringing smuggled sugar and tea into Bushire district. The masters of the boats dropped their cargo overboard and when interrogated denied everything and protested that they had been out afish- ing. Their denial however did them no good, and they have been placed in the Police lock-up pending further enquiries. 115. Municipality. In the early part of the month the Municipality resumed work on widening and improving the streets in the bazaar.g Several shops have been demolished and the streets are being roofed at the expense * of the shop owners. The local newspaper “ The Khalij-i-iran ” complained in one of its July issues of the inactivity of Saved Husain Behbehani, President of the Council of Municipality, Bushire. It alleged that persons, suffering from contagious diseases are allowed to sell food articles in the bazaar ; baths are not inspected ; no control is maintained over the market prices ; and finally the streets and thoroughfares are neither levelled nor metalled. Stirred by the above criticisms, the Muni cipality raised the municipal tax on hotels to Krans 60 each. This sent in the Hoteh keepers on strike who closed their hotels for two days ; it was finally agreed that the tax should be fixed at Ts. 2 per month. 116. Persian Marine. 1 The ship “ Khazaliah ” was sold to j Mirza Jalal Bushiri for Krans 36,000. 117. National Bank of Persia, Mohammerah. Salim Niamani, Accountant of the Na tional Bank of Persia, Mohammerah, has misappropriated Krans 10,500. It is reported that in defending his action* he made the ingenious excuse that he took the money because he was hard up. As Salim was engaged by the Central Office, Tehran, the Manager has referred the matter to Headquarters. In the meantime he is employing him on clerical work in his own office room. 118. Persian Baluchistan. 1. Reference paragraph No. 100-1 of 1931. The officer in charge of Telegraphs, Jask, has since reported that there is no definite information indicating from which port in the Trucial Oman the arms were brought. But it is believed that they came from Baraimi in the interior. 2. Reference paragraph No. 100(3) of 1931. The Mudir of Customs, Bunji, has since been persuaded to return to 1 Bandar Abbas. This shows that Mir Barkat is not willing to antagonise the Persian authorities by harbouring a fugitive from the law. 3. On the 14th July a Baluchi by name Abdur Rasul Abdul Nabi of Dastiar, entered the Customs office at Ganjan (Biaban), threatened the Mudir; took possession of Krans 460 hard cash, a magazine rifle, ammunition, customs seal and flag ; and made his escape with the booty. Owing to continued threats and robberies in Bahmadi and Bunji, the Mudirs of Customs there fled to Jask. They complain that it is unsafe for them to remain at their posts and continue their duties with a guard of only two farrashes provided by Mir Barakah Khan. Their colleague at Jask, however, persuaded them to return, and has represented their case to the Customs authorities in Bandar Abbas. 4. On the 22nd July 25 armed Tahirzais * raided G rau and Bandaron. They plun dered 12 houses and set fire to 8 others. Before leaving, they seized the Kalantar of Girau, and shaved half his beard, one eye brow and half his head. This action, it is said, is a reprisal for a similar treatment meted o.ut by Jalal, son of Mir Barkat Khan, to a Taherzai sometime back. Mir Barakat Khan has written to Chirag and Mordad sons/of Mustafa Khan and also to the Kalantas of Jagin, Gabrig and Sadech to collect men and join him at Guski. He intends taking vengeance on the Tahirzais. 5. According to news received by H. B. M.’s Consul, Kerman, early in June, detach ments from Iranshahr, Jiruft, Rudbar, Kuhistan and Bandar Abbas proceeded to Bashakird with the object of arresting Abdul Husain Khan, Kameran and dis arming that district. 6. Recruitment of conscripts in Bam began in June. It is reported that the recruiting officer has displayed undue severity in the execution of his work and even went so far as to prosecute youths serving in the Amniah and Police for evad ing enlistment. 119. Kerman. Local Interests .—His Excellency Mirza Reza Khan, Governor General, is ener getically pushing forward a scheme for the establishment of a Spinning Mill at Kerman. He has by threats succeeded in collecting the first instalment from the prospective shareholders, and it is said now he intends visiting Yezd where he hopes to persuade the traders to take up shares. He also wants the National Bank of Persia to participate in the enterprise. When the idea of a mill was first mooted, a sample of Ravfinjang cotton was sent to India to be tested as to its suitability. The report has not yet been received, so the Governor’s activities would appear to be premature. The Sharq Co.’s branch at Kerman has offered to supply the required machinery ; but if the National Bank of Persia become shareholders, it is probable that the machi nery will be imported from Germany and6 maiden voyage carrying cargo and passen gers for Aumori, Lavar, Daiyor and Lin- gah, and returned on the 20th July. 121.
