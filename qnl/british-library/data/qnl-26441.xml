Maigret left again on 26th January, intending to proceed via Port Sudan and Hudeyda to San's and to return about 10th February in the d’Iberville, which will call for him at Hudeyda. It is now known that the status of the French Consulate here was raised to that of a Legation by a French law promulgated, I believe , last July and that M. Maigret has been given the ranlc of Minister Resident. These changes have not yet been officially announced to his colleagues in Jedda but I understand that the new Legation is to be inaugurated with some ceremony on M. Maigret*s return and that the d'Iberville which has on board Re r Admiral Rivet, Commanding Officer of the French naval division in the Levant, will stay for the celebration. I believe that Ibn Saud intends to come to the ilejaz a few days earlier than he need do to attend the Pilgrimage and will visit Jedda to receive the credentials of no less than three Ministers, viz. M» Maigret, the recently arrived ^Sinister of the U.3.S.R. (See my despatch No.568 of 17th December 1936) and the Iranian Minister, whose arrival I am reporting in a separate despatch.5 I have thought these developments worthy of toeing recorded in a special report tout I doutot whether any real political significance attaches either to llaigret^ visit to Ban’s or to the changes affecting the French representation in Jedda. As you are aware M. Malgret plays no important role here. He is a fairly well-informed observer of events tout he has not visited France for some years and continues to give the impression of having little pull with the French Government. He has a much greater connexion with Syria and the French authorities there. He has vague leanings towards Islam and is, I think, on the best of terms with King Abdul Aziz and the Saudi Government tout even with them he does not appear to carry much weight. I believe that the creation of a Legation and M. Maigretfi promotion are more than anything else the realisation of his own moderate ambitions and would have taken place sooner tout for financial considerations in Paris.

The ship stayed only one night in Jedda, however, and I have heard no more of any special festivity to celebrate the transformation of the former French Consulate into a Legation.

[E 7796/714/25} No. L Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 31.) (No. 365.) Sir, Jedda, December 9, 1934. I HAVE the honour to inform you that my French colleague, M. Roger Maigret, who, as you are aware, is Charge d’Affaires en litre of the French consulate here, informed me in the course of conversation yesterday that his Government now proposed to raise their mission in Saudi Arabia to the status of a Legation. Budgetary provision had been made, and he expected the change to date from the 1st January next. He stated, in answer to my enquiry, that the head of the post would hold the rank of Minister, and that he would remain on in that capacity. On my congratulating him, he explained that although he understood privately that his appointment had been contemplated by his Ministry in any case, yet Fuad Bey Hamza had interested himself with the French Government to secure his selection. The elevation of the French representation here, and the appointment of M. Maigret, may well have been, although the latter did not say so, amongst the questions discussed with the French Government by Fuad Bey Hamza during his recent visit to Europe. 2. M. Maigret, who, as is his wont, has remained virtually invisible during the summer, is again becoming locomotive, as he proposes to leave Jedda within a few days for a three weeks’ visit to the Yemen. Upon his return from Sana, he hopes, before the Haj, to pay a brief visit to Syria to meet the High Commissioner there. 3.

(VOTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT IN my telegram No. 227 of to-day’s date I have summed up briefly my conversations with my French colleague and Fuad Bey Hamza regarding the visit of the former, in the company of the latter, to Riyadh. It may interest you to have a fuller account of this episode. 2. As reported in Mr. Calvert’s despatch No . 859 o f the 12th December, M. Maigret and Fuad Bey started on the 11th December, two days before my own return to Jedda. They reached Riyadh on the morning of the 15th December and left again on the 18th December, getting back to Jedda and Mecca respectively on the 21st December. 3. M. Maigret lay very low, as his custom is, until the 27th December. On that day a telephone message from me asking whether he had returned elicited the offer of a visit. When he came, he first gave me some interesting general . impressions. He contrasted Sana, a place where one merely got back to the Middle ! Ages, with Riyadh, which might be a Babylonian city of 5,000 or 6,000 years ago. ' all sun-dried bricks and silence, in a setting of illimitable desert. 4. I observed presently that M. Maigret’s journey had been the subject of much comment. In order to draw him out, I cited, half-jestingly, the rumours that a Saudi prince was to sit on the Syrian throne, that negotiations regarding the Hejaz Railway were in progress, or that France was intervening in the quarrel between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya. 5. M. Maigret endorsed my own sceptical comments on rumours so fantastic and proceeded to tell me, with an air of great frankness, what he represented as the whole truth. He had a passion for visiting out-of-the-way places. He had a great sympathy for this country. He intended to write a book. His Government had authorised him to go to Riyadh, and he had gone there on the invitation of Ibn Saud. He had undoubtedly talked politics with the King, but only European politics. France had no political interest in Arabia, except in so far as her position in Syria raised certain questions, e.g., in regard to tribes, and intensified her concern with Moslem affairs. His Government always impressed on him the necessity for a discreet avoidance of mixing up in Arabian politics. And so on and so on, for a pleasant hour or more. 6. It is quite true that M. Maigret, who hardly leaves his house while in Jedda, has a great taste for distant travel in the East. I had been prepared, for this reason and because I do not believe him to “ cut much ice ” with his own Government, to discount the importance of his trip to Riyadh. Nevertheless, his statement left one thing unexplained, namely, why the Saudi Government had authorised the visit. The ban on non-Moslem access to Riyadh has been slightly relaxed this year, witness the recent visit of Mr. Twitched, but the reception there of any foreign diplomatic representative is a portent. 7. On the 28th December Fuad Bey came to see me for the first time since my return. Our first subject of conversation was M. Maigret’s adventure. I trotted out the same three rumours, with much the same comments as before, and added a vague reference to suggestions that the French Government might be prepared to give some kind of material assistance to Ibn Saud. Fuad Bey expatiated on M. Maigret’s love of travel, his desire to write a book and his great friendliness towards this country and Islam. He dealt systematically with my collection of rumours. There was no present question, he said, of a Saudi candidature for the Syrian Throne. There could be no such question so long as the French were committed to a policy in Syria which turned on its having a. republican constitution, and any modification of which would raise complicated questions, among them that of securing the assent of the League of Nations. If the Saudi Government reopened the question of the Hejaz Railway, as thev had it EASTERN (Arabia). January 22, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. SeotioV 2. ) A ;s '• No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 22, 1934.) (No. 371. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, December 30. 1933.*2 in their minds to do, they would approach His Majesty’s Government in the first instance. All that had happened so far was that his own replies to interviewers in Egypt had had a repercussion in Syria, where he had been asked many questions and been led to engage in very general conversations of an informal kind. He dismissed more briefly any idea of French intervention in the quarrel with the Imam. 8. Fuad Bey went on to say that there was, none the less, a business side tc M. Maigret’s journey. After obtaining my promise that what he was about to say would be regarded as'highly confidential, he explained that when he was in Paris with the Amir Feisal in the spring of last year, certain questions had been broached. Conditions in Paris made it impossible to pursue them at that time. The French had tried later to communicate with him at The Hague and Berlin, but he was already in Moscow when they got into touch with him. Skipping a long interval, he said that eventually the French Government had charged M. Maigret to communicate their views on the desiderata put forward by the Saudi mission last year. They related to war material, a loan and a mission to help with military organisation and the Saudi air force. It had been decided to invite M. Maigret to convey the French reply to the King at Riyadh. 9. Fuad Bey was much less precise as to the messages which my French colleague had brought. His language generally, rather than any definite state ment, implied that the negotiations were approaching a happy close. As I have stated in my telegram under reference, he mentioned financiers, and not the French Government, as the providers of the prospective loan, and he said that the mission, though recruited under the auspices of the French Government, would be of a civilian character. 10. Fuad Bey assured me more than once that these dealings with the French implied no departure from his Government’s policy of friendship with His Majesty’s Government. He reminded me lightly and amiably of their failure to obtain from British sources the help they needed. I said that we could not criticise the action of the Saudi Government in cultivating French friendship, and begged him to believe that my desire for information was inspired by interest and not by jealousy. I did not comment other wise on his statement, except for a passing remark, when he mentioned the proposed military mission, that I thought the Saudi Government had been looking to Turkey about a year ago for this kind of assistance. Fuad Bey replied, with a slight and perhaps unintentional lapse from strict accuracy, that there had only been a question of sending young men to be trained in that country. 11. Assuming Fuad Bey’s explanation to have been generally in accordance with the facts, and he was not only more precise but also more convincing than my French colleague, it remains to be seen what advantages the French Government expect in return for their benevolence. I have no means of obtaining information on this subject. My general view is that there will be little reason for perturba tion, even if the negotiations do in fact produce concrete results. Despite my regard and admiration for Ibn Baud, I have still to discover that, in his dealings with European Powers or commercial interests, he ever gives much that is solid or of durable value for what he receives. I have never thought, for instance, that a Power providing an air force can hope for much of a “ cinch ” on the air of Saudi Arabia. 12.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 325 o f the 31st October and to my 3 ^ telegram No^216 of the 10th December, relative to the visit of M. Roger Maigret, French Charge d'Affaires, to Ibn Sand at Riyadh, I have the honour to report that, as foreshadowed in my telegram under reference, my French colleague, who 33 arrived back from leave on the 3rd December, left for Riyadh yesterday in a car provided by the Government in company with Haji Hamdi, the French-Algerian vice-consul and Fuad Bey Hamza. In my interview with the latter on the 10th December, he admitted that M. Maigret’s visit would not be of a purely personal and private nature as I was informed on the 27th October by Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman. Conversations would take place on matters of no great importance, except to the countries concerned, viz., Syria and Saudi Arabia, and would relate to trade and commercial questions affecting the two countries. Fuad Bey remarked that he expected to be absent in Nejd for about two weeks, but that on'his return he hoped to be in a position to give Sir Andrew Ryan more information in regard to the objects of this visit. He also observed that M. Maigret was “ opening the door ' of Nejd to other visitors. 2. I understand that M. Maigret’s projected visit was known in Syria at the latest early in November, as the Indian vice-consul of this Legation, passing through Damascus about that time on his return from leave in Istanbul, found rumour very busy with the news. It was stated in some quarters that France was ready to lend countenance to Ibn Saud in his present political difficulties, and the wildest conjectures were current according to which Italy and France were the “backers ” of the Imam and Ibn Saud respectively in the present dispute, Great Britain, for once, being omitted from the picture. 3. It would be of great interest to learn in due course from His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Damascus, to whom I am sending a copy of this despatch, whether any light, independent of the perhaps somewhat refracted information promised by Fuad Bey Hamza, can be thrown from Syria upon the inward reasons for this visit. Can there be among these matters of mutual tj commercial interest to the two countries the rather baffling problem of the market |j for thrones in Syria? I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT.

I HAVE the honour to inform you, in somewhat greater detail than I was able to give in my telegram No. 182 of the 27th October, of my interview with the Minister of Finance on that day, relative to the successful request of M. Roger Maigret, French Charge d’Affaires, to be allowed to visit Ibn Baud at Riyadh. 2. M. Maigret, as was recorded at paragraph 183 of Jedda Report for August, left on the 9th August for Syria, where, it is understood, he passed the whole of his leave of absence. According to a statement of a member of the French Legation here to Mr. Furlonge, he was expected to return by a French naval despatch-boat, which was calling at Beirut on its way to the Red Sea. His return was due almost any day, when I received Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s request for an interview on the 27th October. As I have reported, his Excellency informed me that he had been instructed by the King at Riyadh, through Amir Feisal at Mecca, to bring to my notice that M. Maigret had approached Fuad Bey Hamza, whilst the latter was in Syria, with a view to obtain the King’s permission to pay a private visit to Nejd upon his return to this country. Upon his return from abroad, Fuad Bey Hamza had placed this request before His Majesty, who had been pleased to accede to it. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman went on to say that M. Maigret was expected the following day and would leave for Nejd at once, and again referred to the private and personal nature of the visit, and alluded to M. Maigret’s wish to see the country. He added that, should anything transpire during this visit not of a strictly private character, I should learn of it in due course from Fuad Bey Hamza himself. In reply to a question, he said that the French Charge d’Affaires’ interview with the King would take place at Riyadh or perhaps somewhere in the vicinity. 3. The following morning, the 28th, the French naval despatch-boat Tyres duly arrived, but no M. Maigret was observed to come ashore. From information subsequently received it would appear he was not on board, and I now learn that he is expected on or about the 5th November. 4. It is unprecedented for a foreign representative in Jedda to be allowed not merely to pay a visit to Nejd, but to be accorded an interview by Ibn Baud in his desert fastnesses at Riyadh. Whether it is fanciful to read, or attempt to read, into this rather startling piece of information more than its superficial meaning I am at present unable to decide. M. Maigret, in September 1932, paid a visit to Taif—an achievement in its way, though of no special significance—and also, I believe it is true to say, that he takes an intelligent, if not scholarly, interest in matters pertaining to the Arab world. This, however, seems scarcely adequate as a reason, and the alacrity, almost, with which his desire in this instance has been granted does little to dispel one’s doubts as to the reasons for this so-called private visit. The cloak of privacy is often the most useful wear in the more delicate dealings with Eastern minds, and the news when it becomes generally known will be, I believe, thus construed. 5. In my telegram under reference I have drawn attention to the fact that this meeting at Riyadh will, if it occurs, form a precedent which other foreign representatives, not least the Soviet Minister, may welcome. It will be interesting to observe whether, indeed, they make any attempt to follow where M. Mai^ret is so unexpectedly leading the way. 6.

JEDM, 1702 Januar jr 6, honour to state that in the course of a visit paid to me a few days ago by the French Charge d'Affaires, I turned the conversation on to the negotiations for a treaty between France and Ibn Sa*ud. Monsieur Maigret is a most effusive colleague on the personal side but is usually very reticent about affairs. He never mentioned his negotiations to me before I left Jedda in August, Information from various local sources during my absence appeared to confirm what I had already heard from my Italian colleague viz. that the French, like the Italians, were at loggerheads with the Hej'az Government regarding the insertion in their treaty of a clause similar to Article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda relative to the repression of the slave trade. the other day threw a new light on the matter. I con doled with him on the difficulty he had experienced in his negotiations• He admitted that they had gone very slow and attributed this partly to the elusiveness of the Hejaz Government, which, as you know, is inaccessible My conversation with Monsieur Maigret for His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.for purposes of personal discussion, except by telephone, ^ save on the few occasions when 5*uad Bey Hamza, or much more rarely the King himself, visit Jedda. In reply, however, to a remark of mine that I understood him to have come to a deadlock over slavery, he said that the real difficulty and the only matter of importance was the question of nationality. He almost brushed slavery aside and said that the trouble about nationality had to do with Algerians. He explained that formerly there had been an important Algerian community at Medina and that, although it had been a good deal dislocated by war conditions, it was still a matter of concern to his Government to establish their claim that the Algerians should be recognised as French. I did not follow his explanation of the grounds on which the Hejaz Government counter-claimed them. I asked him about Syrians. He said that these gave rise to no difficulty. Some were voluntarily Hejazi, but in other cases the Hejaz Government recognised their French-protected status. 3 * We are ourselves greatly interested • in the &lt; l uestion the Hejaz Nationality Law, a subject wuich I shall have to take up again with the Hejaz Government when I receive your further instructions on various points. It is satisfactory to know that the French Government definitely interested, as it lessens the danger of the Hejaz are soHejaz Government springing on as a revised version of the present law, without sufficient consideration of the views of foreign powers, I have the honour to be, etc., (Sgd) Andrew Ryan.•*'N COPY Or p - B. 5523/5117/91) f * ' ' 5p JBDDA, No. 270 September 27, 1930 Sir &gt; I have the honour to report that my Italian colleague left Jedda yesterday on two months leave of absence. Monsieur Lorenzo, his local Vice-Consul, replaces him. .x 2. Monsieur Sollazzo informed me that he had hoped only to quit Je^da on the completion of his negotiations for a Treaty of Friendship with Ibn Sa T ud. The negotiations, however, are at a deadlock over the question of slavery. Th6y are to be resumed in cooler weather upon his return. 3. The French Vice-Consul has informed Mr. Wikeley that the French negotiations also are at a standstill at the same point. Monsieur Dumarcay added that in his opinion no Furopean power, as a member of the League of Nations, could conclude a treaty with the Hejaz Government unless an anti-slavery clause similar to Article 7 of the British Treaty were included.

Dear Rendel, Puad told me in confidence on August 31 that both the French and Italian treaties with Ibn Sa T ud are held up over the question of slaves. They want an article similar to our' article 7 and a similar exchange of notes covering manumission. Ibn Sa T ud, holding that that article and exchange of notes were part of the price paid to us for his freedom, flatly refuses to concede similar terms to France and Italy. Fuad described the present position as a deadlock. Yours sincerely, C. Cr. Hope-Gill. x Treat of Jedda of 20th May 1927 and notes attached thereto. 'V G. V/ .
