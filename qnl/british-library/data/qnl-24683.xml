GOVERNMENT OP INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To Tee Right Hon’ble JOIIN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 19th July 190G. Sir, We have the honour to address you on the subject of our relations with the Wahidi tribe of Balahaf. 2. In 1894 the Government of India approved the recommendation of the Government of Bombay that Sultan Saleh-bin-Abdulla should be recognised as titular Chief of Balahaf in place of Sultan Mohsin-bin-Saleh who had been deposed, and that a fresh protectorate treaty should be entered into with the new Chief in the names of himself and his relations, in place of the former one executed in 1888. The new Treaty was concluded in 1895, and a eopy of it was forwarded to you with our Secret despatch No. 146, dated 23rd July 1895. 3 . Sultan Mohsin-bin-Saleh subsequently re-established himself as the de facto ruler of the tribe, and was the prime mover in an outrage committed by the tribe in 1902, when the whole of the treasure and cargo contained in a dhow, which was wrecked near Balahaf, was stolen. Restitution of the property was demanded from Mohin-bin-Saleh and his submission was also required. In consequence of punitive measures taken by the Resident, the first condition was complied with, but owing to a mis understanding Mohsin-bin-Saleh did not make his submission to the Resident until December 1904. 4. In January 1905, it was reported that Sultan Saleh, the titular Sultan of Balahaf, had endeavoured to sell his share in the revenues of the port of Balahaf, and also certain territorial rights in the interior of the country to Sultan Ghalib, the son of the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. The alienation of territorial rights without the previous consent of Government was in open viola tion of the Sultan’s treaty obligations, and the whole transaction was vehe mently repudiated by the tribesmen. The cession of territory was treated as void by the Government of India, and a formal notification was issued to this effect. But further the Resident at Aden reported that the Sheikhs of the AVahidi tribe were unanimous in their resolution to depose Sultan-bin-Saleh and to recognise Mohsin-bin-Saleh as their temporary Sultan, since he alone possessed sufficient influence to hold the tribe together. 5 . In view of these facts and having regard to the irregular action of Sultan Saleh, the Government of India decided that Sultan Mohsin should be recognised as titular Chief and that the stipend due to the Sultan should hence forth be paid to him instead of to Sultan Saleh.The Bombay Government were instructed to take tbe necessary stq the conclusion, with the new ruler, of a treaty similar to that of 189o. 0 The new treaty, which is identical with that concluded with Sultan « i»l&gt; nnH does not provide for any increase in the stipend granted to the Sultan, ’rteisrss »&gt; - «= 1 correspondence are enclosed herewith for your information.

Williams, Esq., Under Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 3086, dated the 25th May 1894, containing proposals for the settlement of the affairs of Balahaf. 2. The recommendations made by the Government of Bombay are:— (a) Sultan Saleh-hin-Abdulla should be recognised as titular Chief of Balahaf in place of Sultan Mohsin-hin-Saleh, who has been deposed: that this recognition should have effect from the 3rd May 1894, and that the full stipend of $10 a month should in future he paid to Sultan Saleh-bin-Abdulla; (5) that a fresh Protectorate Treaty should he entered into with the new Chief, in the name of himself and his relations in lieu of the one executed on the 30th April 1888 ; (c) that the stipend of $10 a month withheld since the 1st September 1^93, and due up to the 3rd of May last, should he paid to the sharers in Balahaf, less the share which would have been received by Sultan Mohsin, but for his misconduct. 3. I am to say that the Goyemment of India concur in these proposals, and consider that the present occasion affords a favourable opportunity for adding a clause to the proposed new treaty expressly binding the tribe not to dispose of its territory to any power other than the British Government. In regard to the treatment of Sultan Mohsin-hin« Saleh, I am to say that, unless the Government of Bombay see any special advantage in detaining him as a political prisoner at Aden, he might safely be ignored, and the Wabidi Sultans simply requested to prohibit his entering their country. — Telegram No. 446-P., dated Poona, the 28th^June 1902. From—The Government of Bombay, Political Department, To— The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Following telegram received from Besidentat Aden, dated 26th June:— Begins : Dhow carrying cargo and specie to Mokalla, was wrecked 5th June, near Balahaf. It appears some of the people who got on shore were robbed by Sultan Mohsin, of Balahaf and his brother, hut the Nacoda got specie on hoard another boat, and started for Mokalla. On hearing this Sultan Mohsin fired upon the boat, compelled her to stop, and seized whole of treasure and cargo. Complaint of Governor, Mokalla has just reached me. I am of opinion that we should endeavour to make au example, and propose to send H. M. S. “ Ferseus” also I. M. S. “ Mayo ” with detachment of troops and Political Officer, to demand restoration, failing which, Sultan Mohsin should he brought into Aden, if possible; but if he escapes, his house, and those of brother, should be destroyed. Senior Naval officer agrees as to “ Perseus ”: Approach of south-west monsoon renders very prompt action desirable.—Government of Bombay endorse Resident’s proposals, and consider this a good opportunity of taking His High ness the Sultan of Mokalla, who is now in Aden, on to Mokalla, and thus insure peaceful submission to His Highness by Hussain and Manassar.

It is assumed that Mohsin is the ex-Sultan, who was deposed in 1894. His return to Balahaf does not seem to have been reported by Aden authorities, hut Bury’s recent report states that Mohsin is the actual Sultan, and that Saleh-bin- Abdulla is a mere puppet. The Political Officer should, therefore, ascertain the true state of affairs, and submit a report for such orders as may be necessary. The opportunity may be utilised for taking the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla to Mokalla. AtP. yy- No. 5729, dated Bombay Castle, the 5th August 1902. From—The Hon’ble Mr. S. W.

I am directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter No. 196, dated the 19th July 1902, from the Political Resident, Aden, reporting the result of his visit to Shehr and Balahaf, and to say that the remarks of the Bombay Government will be sent hereafter.

In continuation of my letter No 180, dated 29th June 1902, I have the honour to report that I return to Aden today, having carried out, as far as is possible, the orders of Government regard ing affairs at Shehr and Mokalla, contain ed in the orders, cited in the margin. I may here add that I found it also conve nient to settle the Balahaf* case at the same time, and my proceedings will be reported in the sequence of events. GoTorament of India telegram No. 1122*E.A„ dated 3rd June 1902, received 13th June 1902, under Bombay Government, No. 369-M., dated 6th June 1902.

S. “ Ferseus ” to use force, if neces sary, to carry out the objects in view, was accorded by telegram dated 8th July 1902, and confirmed by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief by tele gram, dated 9th July 1902. 3. I accordingly left on Saturday the 12th instant in the R. I. M. S. 'Mayo? accompanied by Khan Bahadur Muncherji Rustomji Dholu, C.I.E., His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, and his son, Sultan Omar, and, having on board the following troops, under command of Captain G. N. Cory, D.S.O., Royal Dublin lusiliers, with 2nd-Lieutenant E. M. Little, R.G.A., as his Staff Officer:— 100 men, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, under 2nd Lieutenant W. F. Higginson; 25 men, Royal Garrison Artillery, with two 7-pr. guns under Lieute nant R. H. E. Hutton; 75 men Bombay Sappers and Miners, under Lieutenant A. L. Paris. The above were rationed for 10 days. As His Highness the Sultan desired a clear day at Mokalla to arrange certain details, I desired Commander Pears of H. M. S. “ JPersew ” to meet me with his ship at Mokalla on Tuesday morning the 15th instant. 4. Early on Sunday, the 13th instant, we arrived at Balahaf, where I found that the Sultans Saleh-bin-Abdulla and Mohsin-bin-Saleh were up-country. I accordingly despatched a letter to them directing them to meet me at Balahaf3 on my return to that port in three or four days time. I had previously ascertained that this was fully sufficient time for them to comply with my demand, should they decide to do so. 5. The “ 3fnyo” then left, and arrived at Uokalla the same evening. I then addressed letters to Sultan Husain Abdulla at Shear, and to Sultan Munasir Abdulla at Al-Ghail, informing them that I had been instructed to personally inform them of the orders of Government, and requesting them to come onboard the “ Mayo ” at Shehr on Tuesday the loth, together with the chiefs of their troops, in order to hear them read. I also desired Sultan Husain to write to his brother and urge him to meet me. These letters were entrusted to His Highness the Sultan to convey to their destination by camel sowars, and I have since ascertained that both letters were delivered early on Monday morning. Al-Ghail is about twenty miles from Shehr, and thus plenty of time was allowed to Sultan Munasir to comply had he any intention of so doing. His Highness the Sultan and his son landed to make arrangements to despatch a reinforcement of troops to Shehr, in case his nephews should prove contumacious and offer resistance. 6 . Next day, the 14th, was spent at Mokalla at the request of His Highness, and was occupied in ascertaining whether plague still existed at the port, and in obtaining the statements of the Nakoda and others, whose evidence was „ , , „ available in the case of the buggalow Enclosures Nos. 1 «nd 2. i j j j. i&gt; i 1 n n • £ i. 4 . plundered at nalahaf. Copies of state ments are attached, marked Balahaf 1 and 2. Assistant Surgeon Niaz Ali Khan, L. M. and S., who is in the employ of His Highness the Sultan com plained that, though supplied with Haffkine’s serum, no syringes had been sup plied to him. He stated that the last case of plague had occurred about the end of May. He could not give the exact date, as no record of deaths was kept. He was given the box of Lustig’s Gorernment Memos. Nos. 1738 and WM-R dated curative serum. There being no plague at Mokalla, the Hospital Assistant was not landed, and proceeded with the ship. As H. M. S. “ Perseus ” was expected early next morning, Khan Bahadur Muncherji Rustomji Dholu, C.I.E., pro ceeded on shore to accompany His Highness and his son Ghalib to the ship. 7. H.M. S. “ Perseus” was sighted at 9 a.m. next morning, the 15th* and both ships proceeded to Shehr, arriving there at about 1 p.m. 8 . A brief description of the town of Shehr may here be useful to explain subsequent events. The town of Shehr is situate on an open sandy plain about three hundred yards from the shore, and contains about 6,000 inhabitants. The houses are mostly of stone, and are built on the lines of the ordinary Arab “ Dar ” or fortlet, and are intersected by narrow streets. Except on the seaside, the town is sur rounded by a wall about twenty feet in height, having towers at frequent intervals about thirty feet high, and placed about 150 yards from each other along the wall. The town is about a mile square. The principal buildings in the town are Husn-Al-Riadth, a fort about fifty yards square, with walls said to be 5ve feet thick, about thirty feet high crenelated, and armed with some old S. B. guns. This fort commands both the town and the sea shore, and is the key of the position, and is said to contain a large store of munitions of war, etc. The fort is impregnable to any means in possession of the Sultan, or to anything but modern artillery. The anchorage is about a mile from the shore, where landing is impossible, except in regularly constructed surf boats, of which there are only some five or six. When passing in front of this fort to our anchorage the fort doors were closed, and a number of armed men appeared on the walls. The only other building, of which mention is necessary, is called Dar Nasir, and is situate to the4 rear and west of Husn-Al-Riadth. It is a strong and large building irregular in design but in places is six to seven storeys high. It is the residence of the Governor of the town. On our arrival the British flag was flying from Dar Nasir while a red flag was flying from a flagstaff a little west of Husn-Al- Riadth. I was informed that Sultan Husain resided in Dar Nasir and that Husn-Al-Riadth was occupied by his troops which were said to number from 400 to 450 men all armed with rifles. About two-thirds of the town would appear to have been in possession of Sultan Husain and his adherents, while the remaining one-third was in possession of His Highness the Sultan under another nephew of his named Aysa. The command of the town was thus absolutely in the hands of Sultan Husain and his adherents. 9. Shortly after arrival at Shehr a letter was brought off from Sultan Husain in which he declared that neither he nor the chiefs of his troops could possibly come on board as the surf and sea was high and they would be sea sick. I also ascertained that Sultan Munasir had not responded to my summons and was said to be sick. This I afterwards found out to be a falsehood. The truth being that he had actually started but hearing that His Highness the Sultan had sent reinforcements to Shehr he had returned to Al-Ghail. 10. Though Sultan Husain’s refusal to come on board, also the refusal of the chiefs of his troops to come and the neglect of Sultan Munasir to comply with my summons, seemed to me to be evidence of a general desire to be con tumacious and coupled with the closing of Husn-Al-Riadth and the manning of its walls on our arrival to point to resistance, I determined to exhaust every means at my disposal to obtain a peaceful settlement and accordingly having ascertained that there was little personal risk to him I sent Khan Bahadur Muncherji Rustomji Dholu, C.I.E., on shore to endeavour to induce Sultan Husain to be reasonable. He, however, returned unsuccessful and said that Sultan Husain after a long conversation, in which he asked whether the “ Perseus ” had come merely for show, asked that I would send him the orders of Government in writing, and he also addressed a letter to me to that effect. 11. The attitude assumed by Sultan Husain now seemed to point to resist ance and after an interview with His Highness the Sultan and his son Ghalib m . , , , „ , as to what troops, etc., they had in Shehr I Translation attached, .-donors No. * addressed a letter next morning (the 16th) to Sultan Husain. I may here mention that Khan Bahadur Muncherji Rustomji Dholu mentioned at his interview of the 15th with Sultan Husain that the orders of Government were adverse to him and that he would be required to give up Husn-Al-Riadth and Dar Nasir to the Saltan whose authority must be paramount in the town. I also wrote to Sultan Ghalib directing him to tom tom in the town and warn the people to remove from the line of fire and desir ing him, if Husn-Al-Riadth and Dar Nasir were surrendered before the time mentioned, to hoist the Marine Jack, with which I supplied him, at the main flagstaff west of Husn-Al-Riadth. This letter brought Sultan Husain on board at about 10 a.m. 16th July and I immediately gave him an interview in private. He asked me what the orders of Government were and I replied that they had already been communicated to him by letter but I recapitulated them as under:— (1) That Saltan Husain and Munasir should publicly submit to the Sultan. (2) That Husn-Al-Riadth and Dar Nasir should be surrendered to His Highness. \S) That Sultan Husain’s troops should also submit, and I added that the _ , £ t .a* ..I question of succession had Last paragraph of farorernment of India telegram ± n No 1122-E A., dated 3rd June 1902, receited on 13th been lett Open by IxOVem- june 1902 . ment and that his con duct would influence the future decision of Government in thismatter after the death of His Highness. I further said that His Highness the Sultan desired that he and Munasir should retire to Hadramut and live there ra^phSof Resident’s letter No. 180, dated f or a time when, if their 29th June i902. conduct was satisfactory, he would give them some administrative employment. Sultan Husain complained bitterly of the orders of Government and said that they were quite unjust and improper, hut after considerable conversation and explanation I persuaded him that his only and best course was to submit. Sultan Husain at last said that he had come for the purpose of complying with the orders of Government, but that his troops were in arrears of pay amounting to some 30,000 dollars and that he himself was in debt and it was impossible for him to settle with the troops. I then went and explained the situation to His Highness, who refused to pay any money at all for the purpose, saying, that Sultan Husain had plenty of money and that this was simply a ruse ; I re turned to Sultan Husain and after some further conversation suggested that he should see his uncle and make proper submission and that possibly some solu tion of the difficulty might then be found. Sultan Husain at last agreed to this and I and Khan Bahadur Muncherji Rustomji Dbolu, C.I.E , accompanied him to his uncle’s cabin, where he made his submission to his uncle by saluting him as an Arab subject does his Chief. Both then agreed to forget and forgive the past and finally His Highness Sultan Awadth said that though he would be perfectly justified in punishing his nephews and the troops who had rebelled against him, yet he gave them a free pardon provided they left Shehr and that his nephews should retire to Hadramut for a time, and if he was satisfied with their conduct, he would not forget that they were his nephews and were nearer to him than strangers whom he employed. After a long conversation Sultan Husain was given 24 hours to comply with the Sultan’s demands and he left saying he would try and settle about the pay of his troops. I accordingly postponed active measures for the day. 12. At 8 a.m. next day (17th) Sultan Husain came on hoard and said he had come as decided, but that he had failed to raise money to pay his troops, who declined to give up Husn-Al-Baidth unless they were paid. I then obtained from him an order writing to the chief of his troops to at once surrender Dar Nasir and Husn-Al-Riadth and I addressed a letter to Sultan Ghalib telling him to get the town cleared of people by 10 a.m., and arranged for the same signals as before to signify surrender of the forts. 10 a.m. passed without surrender and at 11-30 a.m. I went on board H. M. S. “Pcrs^#” and desired Com mander Pears to open fire on Husn-Al-Riadth at first and suggested that a blank charge should first be fired to notify the rebels that action was intended. The blank charge had its effect and the signal of surrender was hoisted whilst the ship was being placed in position to open fire effectively on the fort. I returned to the R. I. M. S. “ Mayo, ” and shortly after received a letter from Sultan Ghalib notifying that he was in possession of Husn-Al-Riadth and Dar Nasir which he soon afterwards confirmed by word of mouth and adding that he was now in full possession of the town and that bultan Husain s rebel troops were his prisoners. 13. Meanwhile Sultan Husain had decided that he would prefer to reside in Aden pending division of the property. 14. I addressed a letter to be sent to Munasir by His Highness the Sultan in which I informed him that as he had not chosen to come to Shehr in com pliance with my summons his uncle Sultan Awadth had permission to deal with him as he thought fit. 15. The “ Mayo ” then proceeded in company of H. M. S. “ Perseus ’’to Mokalla where 1 landed His Highness the Sultan and sailed for Balahaf that night at 9 p.m. 16. The difficulty and danger of landing British troops by small detach ments in only a limited number of surf boats at disposal prevented me from 5 344FD6 arranging for Saltan Husain’s public submission to his uncle but I venture to think that no doubt as to his having done so can ever now arise in view of his departure from Shehr and the surrender of Husn-Al-Riadth and Bar Nasir and his actual submission to his uncle in presence of myself and Khan Bahadur Muncherji llustomji Dholu, C.I.E. 17. Until he receives his share of the property Sultan Husain will receive two hundred dollars monthly as already arranged by General Maitland and I have urged the Sultan to hasten the Mansab’s proceedings and will again address him on the subject. 18. I would here mention for the information of Government, that I consi der the conduct of His Highness the Sultan to have been admirable throughout the present proceedings and that matters have terminated so far satisfactory as they have done, in a great measure owing to his generosity and willingness to overlook his nephews’ rebellious conduct. 19. Arrived at Balahaf about 7-30 a.m. on the 18th instant. Burins: the voyage from Shehr to Mokalla, Sultan Ghalib, son of His Highness the Sultan, informed me that he had received letters from Sultan Mohsin-bin-Saleh admitting that he had four * suras * of dollars taken from the wrecked buggalow “ Fateh al- Salam ” and saying that he would restore half, if they agreed to his keeping half. Kow the manifested value of the cargo and specie was as under— Nine donkeys ... %%% Ks. 305 Goods • •• • •• • •• ...” 13,850 Specie ... • t t • •• • •• ... 5,700 dollars. Ship and Nakoda • « • r 32a „ 1 140 Rs. In all probability the goods after the wreck were of little or no value if any were saved at all. 'VYhat became of the donkeys is not known. There remains how ever the specie, seven packages in all, of the aggregate value of about Rs. 9,000. On arrival I sent ashore to see if Sultan Saleh-bin-Abdulla and Mohsin-bin- Saleh had obeyed my summons, but my messenger returned with Sultan Ahmad- bimSaleh, brother of Mohsin, who alleged that my messenger had gone one way while he had come another way. This I considered must have been a direct falsehood as there was nothing to bring Ahmad Saleh to the coast at this season of the year and I felt certain that his brother Mohsin was close at hand but had sent on his brother to see how matters were to be dealt with. Ahmad Saleh admitted that his brother Mohsin had four packages of dollars. Knowing Arabs as I do, little doubt was left in my mind that as he admitted he had four of the packages of specie, in reality he had the whole. In any case it seemed to me that there was little chance of recovery of the cash within a reasonable period and that condign punishment was necessary to prevent a repetition of these acts of piracy which have become too common of late and for which no punishment has ever yet been meted out. Having cleared every one out of the fort, I proceeded on board H. M. S. “ Persew” and desired the Commander to demolish the fort which he did within the space of twenty minutes. A party of Dublin Fusiliers and Sappers were then landed to complete the demolition which was thoroughly and completely accomplished. 20. Sultan Ahmad Saleh is the favorite brother of Sultan Mohsin Saleh and was a few years ago convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for smuggling arms. I have brought this man to Aden and intend to keep him here as a politi cal prisoner pending repayment of the looted specie. 21. After re-embarking the troops, ths'Perseus” and “Mayo” proceeded towards Aden, the “Perseus” parting company and proceeding independently. The “ Mayo ” arrived at Aden on Saturday evening the 19lh instant.22. I would bring to the favorable notice of Gorernment the services of Khan Bahadur Muncherji Rustomji Dholu, C.I.E., on this occasion. 23. My thanks are also due to Commander Pears of H. M S. “ Perseus ” for services so ably and courteously rendered by him and to Captain Fletcher, R. I. M, S. “ Mayo,” and to Captain Cory, B.S.O., and the officers and meu under his command. No. 1, Balahaf .—Sayad Abdulla-bin-Mnhammad states on oath—• I was Nacoda of Sambuk Fateh Sallam of Mokalla, owned by Muhammad- bin-Husen-bin-Zaid of Mokalla. Her tonnage Mas 90 tons. I left Aden for Mokalla and Shehr, on a Sunday at the end of Safar 1320, about the 21st of Safar I think. The vessel had general cargo and seven sooras of dollars. On Thursday the 25th Safar I was steering for Balahaf. The night of that day was dark we could see nothing, the vessel stranded on hard shore, the waves were high and the vessel sprung a leak—we threw some goods overboard—in the morning the vessel got full of water. On Friday early morning some crew and passengers M’ere landed at Jabel Jalla. I took out the seven sooras of specie, my box and books and letters, from the vessel and placed them in the small boat belonging to my vessel, and was intending to go to the Hasn at Balahaf but on my way I saw Ganja ’‘Ateet-Rehman” and made for it. On our way a fishing- boat manned by four men armed with spears and jambias, came to us and said they had come from Sultan, and told us not to go alongside of Ganja “ Ateet- Rehman,and called out to the Nacoda of that vessel not to receive us and if he did, they will cut the rope and send the vessel adrift. These four men took us to the fort at Balahaf and landed us there. They then called three men and took whatever we had to the fort. We sat in the fort m hole day and in the evening Sul tan Mohsin arrived from Jabel Jalla. I told Sultan Mohsin that the seven sooras of specie belonged to merchants and a bag of money belonged to the ship- containing $ 320 belonging to the ship and Rs. 140 in a bag was a sum given to me by Salim Saeed of Aden, clerk of Aman Salah. Sultan Mohsin said leave all there for the present. They will think over it and asked us to go out of the fort. After a time I went and spoke Sultan Mohsin again, and he said let all passengers come; and if they agree to pay one-half of what they have got he would let t hem go. All passengers willingly paid to the sultan one-half of what money they had. I went and told Sultan Mohsin that I wanted the money be longing to the people, he replied if I agreed to pay one-half of the money and give him in waiting that I had agreed to pay him, he would pay me one-half and let me go, I replied I cannot give him one-half of the money nor a sanad as he wished, as the money belonged to merchants. He said in that case I may go I then asked for my box and the books and papers but he declined to give them. At night at about iO p.m. I, my crew and all the passengers went on board Ganja “ Ateet-Rehman” and came to Mokalla and reported the circumstance to Sultan Ghalib. When I went to the fort of Balahaf, the place was full of people—the fort was full of soldiers—I know Sultan Mohsin well and I saw him there. I do not know the four men who came on my boat but one had a bold head and a long beard is said to be a cousin of the Sultan he came and took us to the fort by force and took possession of the money and everything we had saved in the boat.

I left Aden for Mokalla and Balahaf with general cargo, on the 20th Safar on a Saturday. I arrived at Balahaf on the evening ot Wednesday the 24th Safar and anchored off Balahaf fort. I landed goods and passengers that night, and the follow ing day. At about 9 a.tvt. on Friday the 26th Safar I heard that a sambuk was wrecked off Jabal Jalla. After a time I saw a small boat coming towards my boat from the direction of Jabal Jalla. At that time a boat set out from the fort, shouting come towards the land, the boatmen said they will go alongside of my Ganja, they said no, you cannot do. I said I will take these distressed men,* the men told me if I did that I will suffer for it—they took the boat to the fort— I then landed, and enquired what happened and remained at the fort. In the afternoon Sultan Mohsin arrived by land from Jabal Jalla and ordered all the men to go out of the fort and they will consider among themselves as to what steps to be taken. After a time I went to the Sultan with Nacoda Sayad Abdulla-bin Muhammad and asked for the money taken from the Nacoda of the wrecked boat, t ultan Mohsin replied where are the passengers, let them come and pay one-half of the money they possessed. I said they will not do, this is oppression—he replied it is my wish. The passengers said they will pay what else can they do—they are four and paid one-half ot what money thty had. Nacoda Sayad Abdulla then demanded the money taken from his boat, Sultan Mohsin replied that Nacoda must pay one-half and give in writing that he willingly did so, Nacoda replied this will not do—the Sultan’s men brought them on land by force and he cannot pay—Sultan Mohsin then told the Nacoda Sayad Abdulla to go in that case. I took all the crew and passengers of the wrecked boat on board my Ganja and brought them to Mokalla. Nacoda Sayad Abdulla demanded his boxes, books and letters from Sultan Mohsin but the latter declined to give them. I know Sultan Mohsin well.

Jffer compliment*.—! have received your letter by the hand of Khan Bahadur Munoherji Rustoraji, C.I.E., and have understood its content. I can not accept your excuses and those of your Muccadams that you are unable to come on board to hear the orders of Government and I therefore think that your disposition is not good. 1. The orders of Government are that you and your brother Munssir should submit to His Highness the Sultan in as public a way as you have defied his authority and the orders of the British Government. 2. I therefore require you to notify to me your willingness to obey the orders of Government and to deliver over to His Highness the Sultan, Dar Nasir and Husn-Riadth by 12 noon to-morrow the 10th Rabi-ul-Akher when all your troops are also to make submission to His Highness the Sultan. If this is not done, 1 shall open fire on Husn-Riadth and Bar Nasir at 1 p.m. If therefore you and your troops intend to defy the orders of Government you should instruct all the women and chidren to remove themselves from the vicinity of the fort and the Dar and the line of fire if not you are responsible for what may occur. If you and your troops obey these orders Government will advise your uncle the Sultan to treat you and your brother with mercy and kindness and to make su'ficient provision for you and your brother until the Mansab shall have determined the shares you are entitled to in the property. May you be preserved. f No. 6072, dated Bombay Castle, the 16th August 1902. From— The Hon’ble Mr. S. W. Edgkrley, C.I.E., I.C.S., Acting Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Pepartment. I have tbe honour to advert to the report of the Resident at Aden, No. 196» dated the 19th July 1'. 02, submitted with my letter No. 5729, dated the 5th August 1902, in so*far as it deals with incidents at Balahaf. 2. I am to say that after the events reported in full in 1894 nothing of L 0 4 „ moment was reported in regard to the ..SrlL'f r 6 “ Wahidis of Ralahaf until 1901. la that appended'. year three of tbe Wabidi Chiefs came into Aden and endeavoured to secure the renewed recognition of Mohsin bin Saleh as Chief cf the Wahidis, and Mohsin evidently made an offer of very complete submission to the Resident. It was thought unnecessary to disturb existing formal arrangements, but the report shows that Mohsin had re-established his ascendancy in the tribes. It is also curious that the motive which induced the Chiefs to come into Aden was their fear of Kaiti aggressions, yet the next matter reported is a gross outrage on a wrecked dhow belonging to Mokalla an action which they might reasonably expect would rouse the resentment of His Highness the Sultan. Probably, however, they were at the date of the occurrence unaware of His Highness’s return to Aden and to Mokalla with the material assistance of the British Government. It will be noticed m^reports of 1901 that the Resident did not then think it desirable to allow His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla to absorb such smaller ports as Balahat; but at that time the trouble in regard to tbe traffic iu arms was less acute and there was no cause of action such as the present outrage was calculated to afford. His Excellency tbe Governor in Council has not ra sed the question ol an 344FD10 occupation of Balahaf on the present occasion because, before he could usefully do so, information was received that the Resident had returned to Aden, punitive action had been taken, and it had become clear that His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla would be sufficiently occupied in his own territory. 33nt His Excellency is of opinion that it would form an effective warning to these Chiefs to tell them through the brother now at Aden that if restitution be not made, or if their harbour continue to be an object of suspicion in regard to the arms trade, it will be necessary for Covernment to consider very seriously whether they can be permitted to continue to control it. If a warning of that character be approved, the Chief now in dention at Aden might be released in order to bear it as a prolonged detention is in any case out of the question. Apart from the above, a sufficient punishment for the offence appears to have been exacted, and if restitution is secured cither by the measures taken by the Resident or as a result of a message as above suggested, the incident will, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, have been very sufficientsy dealt with. No. 106, dated the 18th March 1901. From— Majou H. M. Abud, Acting Political Resident, Aden, To—J. L. Jenkins, Esq., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to inform you that on the llth instant, I had an inter view with the following persons :— Sultan Saleh bin Abdullah, the Wahidi, Sultan Ahmed bin Saleh „ Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh „ 2. The first is the titular Chief of the Wahidi of Balahaf, the second is a sharer in the port and was imprisoned in the Aden Jail in 1894 for infringe ments of the Arms Act, while the third is the former Chief of the Walndi, who left his country in 1894 owing to internal dissensions caused by his wish to sell Balahaf to the French, which was induced through anger at the imprisonment of his brother, Ahmed bin Saleh, and whose name w^as omitted from the Treaty of 1895 owdng to his conduct in trying to sell the port to either the French or the Turks. 3. These persons handed me four documents, namely, (1) a document signed by the first two to the effect that Mohsin bin Saleh, who w^as deposed in 1891 for the reasons above named, should become the titular Chi^f of the Wahidi and that the Protectorate Treaty of 1895 should be binding on him ; (2) a document binding all three not to sell Balahaf to any one and including the Kayti; that Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh should not sell nor dispose of nor lease to any Power, the Kayti, or any other person certain named places ; that the shares in Balahaf and Gila should remain the same; (?) a duplicate of No. 2 ; (4) a paper purporting to elect Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh, the titular Chief of the Wahidi. Translations of these documents are attached. 4. They all three admitted their signatures to 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and stated that they were willing to abide by what w ? as written therein. In reply, I informed them that, as Mohsin bin Saleh’s name had been omitted from the Protectorate Treaty of 1895 and as he w r as at that time w r ell known to be a well- wisher of any Government rather than the British and that he had endeavoured to sell Balahaf to a foreign Powder, I should refer the 'whole matter to Govern ment together with the papers, and that until Government had replied I could only recognize Sultan Saleh bin Abdullah as the titular Chief and that all cor respondence, the payment of stipends and presents, etc., w r ould be made to him and that I should hold him responsible for fulfilment of the obligations devolved on him by the Treaty. It w ill be noticed that the exclusion of Mohsin bin Saleh’s name from the Treaty of 189 ) had been remarked and provided for by document 1, which imposes on him the responsibility of that Treaty. The threewere much disconcerted at my reply and Mohsin bin Saleh actually took off his sword and handed it to me as a token of his absolute submission to the British GoTernment. This is an extremely rare thing for an Arab to do and much astonished me, but I was soon to learn the reason for it. They next represented to me their extreme fear of the Kayti and stated that his purchase of Haifa was forced on the V\ ahidi of Bir Ali who was very unwilling to part with the place. ^ They said that the Kayti had designs on both Bir Ali and Balahaf and on their country generally and they said that sooner than part with them to the Kayti, they would hand oyer their country to the British Government and leave the place altogether. I attribute the whole of this matter to their fear of the Kayti which was very evident and they pressed me for an assurance that the Kayti should not he permitted to purchase their country, nor to acquire it in any other way. They have since written me a letter asking for a written assur ance on this point. I replied to them that according to the Treaty of 1895 they were forbidden to sell, lease or mortgatre their country to any other than the British Government and that the Kayti could not forcibly dispossess them of it without the consent of the British Government under whose protection they were. Ihey then took leave apparently satisfied after I had told them to write to me on the subject. Personally I am of opinion that it would be impolitic to allow the Kayti to absorb these smaller ports, ichose owners are under Hritish protection, though, ro doubt there would be advantages in such a course, yet were he allowed to do so, the Arabs in general would undoubtedly think that protectorate treaties with the British Government were valueless, and thus the disadvantages would swallow up the advantages. 5. As regards the first three documents, I hardly think that there would be any danger in the recognition by Government of the’arrangements they propose as to the Chieftainship, as the protectorate treaty has b^en notified to some, if not to all, of the Powers. Thus unless any Power deliberately wished to be unfriendly there could be no repetition of the events of 189i-95. On the other hand the arrangement appears to have the consent not only of the present Chief but also of the most important Sheikhs of the Wahidi, and on the principle of non-interference with the internal affairs of the Arab tribes the arrangement would not seem to be objectionable. In fact his recognition would seem to be the only course open to Government, as otherwise, he would never be satisfied but would be restless and only too ready to cause trouble whenever opportunity offered. Personally he is the fittest of the family to rule the Wahidi, whereas the present Chief is little more than a nonen ity. No. 1. Praise he to God, tne Lord of the Universe. On the 23rd of Al K tdah 1318 there appeared before us the Chiefs, namely, Saleh bin Abdullah bin Ahmed and Ahmed bin Saleh bin Nasar and acknowledged on behalf of themselves that Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh should be their Chief on land and sea and for the im provement of their affairs and to enter into a treaty with the British on their behalf. The responsibility of the former treaty between the relations of Nasar bin Abdullah and the British should rest on Saltan Mohsin bin Saleh bin Nasar.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Abud, Acting Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay. In continuation of paragraph 14 of my confidential letter No. 196, dated 19th July last, I have the honour to inform you that I have received a letter from His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, stating that he had for warded my letter mentioned in the above paragraph to Manassar, together with one from himself, by the hand of the Mansab. The Sultan states that in his letter he exhorted Manassar to return to his allegiance and to retire to Had- ramaut in which case he would show him mercy and favour and would give him what he was entitled to, but that if he did not desire to go to Hadramaut he had no objection to bis going to Aden. The Sultan reports that the Mansab delivered Ids letters and used his best endeavours to induce Manassar to comply, but that the Mansab returned unsuccessful without any reply from Manassar to either letter. Consequently the Sultan sent his troops to AL Ghail and captured the forts outside the town and the town itself, but that Manassar and his family were still in the fort with some men. The Sultan adds that negotiations are now proceeding with Manassar and that full particulars will be forwarded later on. 2. The Sultan does not mention whether he was opposed whilst taking possession of A1 Ghail, or whether there was any bloodshed, hut I conclude that had any loss of life or fighting occurred, His Highness would have men tioned the matter. 3. From the tone of the Sultan’s letter I am in hopes that a peaceful solu tion of the matter may yet be looked for. 13 / 344FDTelegram, dated Aden, the 19th September 1902.

I am to request that, with the permission of the Governor in Council, instructions in this sense may be communicated to the Political Resident at From The Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. Bombay, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Please see Foreign Department letter No. 3735 E. B., dated the 2nd November 1901, regarding Balahaf affairs. Mohsin-bin-Saleh arrived at Aden on 8th December, and tendered formal submission to Resident on 10th. Following telegrams have been received from Resident, dated 18th, 27th, and 28th January. My letter No. 112, dated 9th January. Sultan Ghalib of Mokalla has written that Sultan Saleh-bin-Abdulla has sold his share of Balahaf to him. He only awaited my signature to confirmation of the deed of sale. No reference was made to me about this. I have replied that I could not possibly give my consent without reference to Government. I do not recommend it. Letter follows. Since my telegram of the 18th January, reporting purchase of share of Balahaf by Sultan Ghalib, Mohsin has shown me a letter, purporting to be from Ghalib to Customs official, Balahaf, informing him of purchase and of his intention to proceed to Balahaf, shortly, and ordering him to have accounts of Customs due ready, Ghalib may have written this letter before receipt of mine, refusing recognition of purchase pending the receipt of Government orders. To-day Mohsin has shown me another letter from some of his principal tribesmen, displaying alarm at rumoured purchase of Balahaf, and expressing intention to commence hostilities. Mohsin's younger brother, Hussen, arrived to-day and confirmed this. Mohsin wishes to go Balahaf to prevent hostilities. I have refused permission pending instructions. Meanwhile I am sending Ghalib and Saleh-bin-Abdulla by Elphinstone to-morrow morning, warning them to refrain from any action likely to lead to disturbance, and also a letter from Mohsin to his principal tribesmen, urging them not to commence hostilities. Telegram, No. 787, dated the 1st February 1905. I have just interviewed Mohsin. He asked that he may be allowed to leaveAden within four days’ time, and proceed with his brother, Ahmad-bin-Saleh, to Balahaf to keep matters quiet, leaving a third brother, Hussen, who is now here, as a hostage. If this be permitted, he promised to return himself to Aden within two and*a-half months from date. I recommend this, particularly as the plague is bad, which has frightened him. I believe Mohsin to be sincere. He stated distinctly that, if his brother, Ahmad-bin-Saleh, is not allowed to proceed with him, he cannot himself return to Aden, as he will be too ashamed before his tribesmen. Please reply by telegraph within the time mentioned, as I cannot detain Mohsin longer under my promise of personal liberty to him. The following reply, dated 31st January, has been sent to Political Resident:— Correspondence ending with your telegram of 28th January. See paragraph 4 of your letter No. 142, dated 9th January. Provied you are satisfied as to Mohsin’s bond Jides in submitting existing position and as to validity of the guarantee which Mohsin proposes, namely, that he and his brother will take it in turn to remain in Aden as sureties, Government authorise your permitting Mohsin and Ahmad to proceed to Balahaf for purposes of maintaining peace on following understanding: namely (1), that Hussen remains at Aden; (2) that if Mohsin fails to return to Aden otherwise than with permission of Residency on expiration of two months and-a-half, Government will be free to reconsider views taken regarding his position and claims, and will give him no further consideration. A full report will be submitted shortly by letter regarding future of Balahaf. No. 1060, dated Bombay Castle, the 14th February 1905. From— C. H. A.

It may be convenient to re-capitulate briefly the recent history of Balahaf. With their letter No. 1230-E., dated the 20th July 1894, the Govern ment of India sanctioned the recommendations of this Government that (a) Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla should be recognised as titular Chief of Balahaf in place of Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh, who had been deposed; that this recognition should have effect from the 3rd May 1894, and that the full stipend of lOdollers a month should, iu future, he paid to Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla ; (b) a fresh protectorate treaty should be entered into with the new Chief in the name of himself and his relations in lieu of the one executed on the 30th April 1888; and (c) the stipend of 10 dollars a month, withheld since the 1st September 1893, and due up to the 3rd of May 1894, should be paid to the shaierj&gt; in Balahaf, loss the share which would have been received by Sultau Mohsin but for his misconduct. In paragraph 3 of the same letter the Government of India directed the incorporation in the new treaty with the Sultan of Balahaf of a clause bind ing the tribe not to dispose of its territory to any power other than the British Government. In 1901 the Bombay Government, in their Resolution No. 2845, dated 16th April 1901, declined to accede to a proposal of the Resident at Aden 16 December 1904. This uovernment letter No. 8010, dated the 29tb December 1004. Letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 142, dated the 9th 27th and 28th January 1905. Letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 260, dated the 18th January 1905. Telegrams from the Political Resident, Aden, dated the 18th, 20th, January 1905. Letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 204, dated the 11th correspondence on the sub ject of Balahaf affairs, I am now directed to forward, for the information of the Gov ernment of India, copy of the papers noted in the margin.which would have subverted the orders of 1894 by recognising Mohsin in place of Saleh as titular Sultan. In 1902, in connection with the outrage on the bungalow Fateh-al-Salam, and with reference to the foregoing order of this Government, the Govern ment of India issued instructions with their letter No 2051-E, dated the 4th October 1902, as to the treatment to be meted out to Balahaf and Mohsin bin Saleh. In consequence of those events Sultan Ahmed bin Saleh, the favourite brother of Mohsin bin Saleh, was interned at Aden, pending the submission of Mohsin, the repayment by him of the monies taken and the furnishing by him of guarantees that he was prepared to conduct ^ himself,^ and to cause his followers to conduct themselves, in a fitting manner in submission to the orders of Government. 3. Mohsin bin Saleh duly paid up the cash taken from the buggalow, but has failed until recently to tender his submission in accordance with the require ments of the Government of India. The correspondenoe now forwarded indicates that there may have been some misunderstanding on the part of Mohsin, due to his belief that he was entitled to expect the release of Ahmed on payment of the monies taken from the Fateh-al~S tlnm ; it also shows how, in accordance with instructions from this Government, General Mason proceed ed to Balahaf on the 22nd November 1)04, hoping to find Mohsin bin Saleh either at Balahaf or sufficiently near to be accessible. Unfortunately the event proved that he was not within a distance which rendered it possible for the Resident to await his response to the summons which he had sent. General Mason, however, left an order requiring Mohsin to present himself at Aden within three weeks and guaranteeing, if became, his safe conduct and personal liberty requiring onlv that he should remain at Aden until the Governments orders were received. In response to this summons Mohsin duly appeared before the Resident at Aden on theSfch December last, and attached to General Mason’s letter of the 11th December is a report of the interview which ensued This Government, I am to say, were not entirely satisfied with the degree of Mohsin’s submission as then reported by General Mason, and consequently referred back to the Resident lor mfor- * Copy enclosed. mation upon six specific points {vide my letter No. 8010, * dated the 29th December 1904,). 4 General Mason’s reply dated the 9th January and the enclosures to that letter would have placed this Government in a position to form a definite con clusion as to the precise attitude which, in their opinion should be adopted in dealin” with Balahaf affairs, and definite proposals would have been formulated hut for the receipt of the Resident’s telegram dated the 18th January, reporting that dultan Ghalib, the son of the Sultan of Shehr and Mo ral a had effected the purchase from Sultan Saleh, the titular Sultan, of the latter s share m Balahaf This report naturally complicated matters, and the receipt or the further telegrams from the Resident, dated the 27th and 28th January last, rendered it necessary to decide immediately whether, with a view to ensuring order in Balahaf, it was not desirable to permit Mohsin, subject to due guaran tees for his behaviour, to return to Balahaf. This permission was accorded on the conditions stated in this Government’s telegram dated the 3,st January. 6 The Resident at Aden has now been directed to obtain and submit Saleh’s explanation of the recent transaction between him and Sultan Ghalib, and a further report will be made to the Government of India after General Mason has replied to this reference. Icoomvaniments (o letter to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Wo. 1060, dated 14th February 1906. Letter No. 200, dated the 27th November 1904. jr rom Major-Genbral H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—C. H&gt; A . Hill, Esq., CUE., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. T have the honour to report that in pursuance of the instructions contained a your No 0805, dated the 9th November 1904, I started trom Aden for 344FDBalaliaf in the B.LM.S. Dalhousie at 6 p.m m on the 22nd instant, arriving at the latter place on the 23rd idem at 7 p.m. 2. It was hoped that Mohsin bin Saleh would be either at Balahaf or at his usual head-quarters, Izzan, about 50 miles from Balahaf. Immediately on arrival I sent my interpreter on shore. He brought back news that Mohsin was neither at Balahaf nor at Izzan, but had proceeded to some place about 24 hours’ journey further away from Izzan, and that even if intimation were to be sent to Mohsin by the quickest means available, it would not be possible for him to meet me before the 2nd December at the earliest. I could not, of course, wait this length of time in view of the fact that Lord Curzon is shortly to pass Aden on his way to India. 3. I remained, however, the whole night and landed the next morning, and my personal enquiry confirmed the news brought by the interpreter as to the impracticability of Mohsin meeting me before the 2nd proximo, I there upon decided to return, which I did on the afternoon of the 24th instant, leaving, however, the interpreter behind with a letter from me to Mohsin, in which I explained to the latter that the intended interview could not take place at Balahaf, and that the only course left for him was to come to Aden. I guaranteed him safe conduct and promised that his personal liberty would not be interfered with, though it would be necessary for him to remain in Aden till such time as the orders of Government were received. In the letter I warned him also that, in the event of his not coming to Aden, Government would be forced to renew the blockade of Balahaf, and possibly to take such measures, as may be necessary to compel his ejection from Balahaf territory. 4. Before leaving Balahaf I had also taken the opportunity of interview ing, in the presence of the Balahaf Customs officer and two others wdio had come on board, the prisoner Ahmed bin Saleh, whom I had brought with me in case he might be required, and impressed upon him that his confinement had been continued solely because of Mohsin’s refractory behaviour, and that the future treatment of both depended largely on the attitude Mohsin might take up—a fact which I thought it would be as well for Mohsin to know, not only from the letter which I caused Ahmed bin Saleh to write to his brother, but also from the lips of his own men. 5. I may mention here that the port of Balahaf consists merely of the ruins of the fortlet demolished under the orders of Government about two years and a half ago and a few huts built of mats. At Balahaf there is no water, which has to be obtained from a place distant about three hours’ journey. The port is maintained merely as a customs post, where a man is stationed to collect the dues on the exports, consisting principally of camel-hair cloth, and the imports, chiefly jowari and kerosine oil, passing through the place from and to the interior. To assist in the collection of the dues there are about 20 to 30 Bedowis knowm as soldiers, also stationed at the port. 6. Besides ascertaining from the Customs officer the whereabouts of Mohsin, I learnt also, on further questioning him, that his duty after collecting the dues was to send half to Mohsin and half to Saleh bin Abdulla, that the soldiers were stationed there both on behalf of Mohsin and Saleh, that they as well as the tribesmen, however, recognised Mohsin as the Sultan, he being a man of greater firmness of character than Saleh, and that even better than Mohsin they would prefer Ahmed bin Saleh. News had also lately reached Balahaf that Mohsin and Saleh had come to some understanding, the terms of which, however, were not known yet. 7. The Customs officer as well as others in Balahaf all say that Mohsin has no desire to act against Government, but he fears to come in least he should be imprisoned like his brother, or perhaps even worse may happen to him. For this mistrust, which Mohsin entertains in spite of the promise of safe conduct given to him before, we ourselves seem to be responsible in a way, for, at the time the fortlet of Balahaf was destroyed as a punishment for the act of 18piracy committed bn the sambook Fateh-ul Salant, Mohsin bin Saleh and Saleh bin Abdulla were given to understand that Ahmed bin Saleh would be detained as prisoner and the port of Balahaf would be closed pending restitution of the looted property. After prolonged negotiations the plundered specie was restored, hut in the meantime orders having been received from Government insisting upon the personal submission of Mohsin, Ahmed Lin Saleh continues to be detained as a hostage, and even the closure of the port was maintained up to December last, which Mohsin regards as a violation of the original under standing. 8. I have, however, hopes that Mohsin will come in, considering the overtures we have made in trying to meet him in his own territory. Should l)e not come in, I propose calling again at Balahaf on my way to or from Mokalla, which it is my intention to visit in the early part of December. I am disposed to make this further attempt to bring about an interview with Mohsin in order that matters may be settled peacefully, as I am of opinion that the nature of the country and the scarcity of water would render military operations difficult. Letter No. 201, dated the 11th December 1904. p r0 ’ m —M ajor-Genera.!. H. M. Ma.son, Political Resident, Aden, To—C» H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In continuation of my telegram of the 8th instant, I have the honour to inform you that I had an interview (memorandum of which is attached hereto! with Mohsin bin Saleh of Balahaf to-day. 2. There is no doubt that Mobsin is a man of very strong character : this is at once apparent on speaking to him. I have also obtained information to this effect in Aden fr &gt;m merchants who trade with B ilahaf, and this has been confirmed by Abdul Liab Salim, interpreter of this Residency, upon whom I cm place rmleh relianee and who was in Balabaf and in the villages in its neighbourhood for about three weeks. 3. I consider that Mohsin had reason to doubt our good faith, for it is actually on record that Mohsin was informed that his brother Ahmed bin Saleh would be detained until the $8,020, which Mohsin had taken from the dhow which was wrecked neer Balahaf, ba paid. The money was paid, but Ahmed was kept a pirsoner and the promise thus broken. 4. The statement of Mohsin that on receiving the letter from the Resident at Izzan it was his intention to follow the messenger with the money to Balahaf, hut that he could not travel as fast as he did, seems to be true.^ The distance 5 from Izzan to Balahaf is 50 miles, and I understand that Mohsin was o'iven only four days from date of letter by the Resident in which to come in. 5. I would bring to the notice of Government the complete submission of Mohsin to me, and I think he is willing to agree to any terms Government may make. 6. Saleh bin Abdulla went to Balahaf while Mohsin was there, the latter having 200 to 300 followers, while Saleh had about 10 men with him, and they were jeered at for accompanying him. He is evidently a mere puppet with no power or position whatever. 7. Should Government not be disposed to accept Mohsin's explanation regarding what has been called his “ refractory conduct,” that is, that he distrusted the Aden officials and for that reason did not come in, then I would propose that his brother Ahmed bin Saleh be elected Sultan. Report of interview held at the Residency (Mice at iO-SO a.m. on Saturday, 10th December 1 1904, between Sultan Mohsin Saleh, the Wahidi, and Major-General H M. Mason, Political Resident, Lieut.-Colonel J. Davies, First Assistant Resident, being also present. Reason for not coming in sooner. After the usual salutations Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh was asked by the Resident why he had not come in for such a long time, although Govern nent Idrequired him to do so. To this he replied that the previous officers had not given him an opportunity for a fair hearing, and he thought it would have been useless for him to come in, as he leaved that justice would not be done to him. Sultan Mohsin was inclined to go into a long history on this point, but the Resident stopped him and reminded him that his brother had been confined all this time owing to his refractory behaviour. Submission, Mohsin still went on dwelling on the unfairness shown towards him. The Resident again interrupted him and explained to him that as a preliminary to all negotiations as to his personal rights and liberties he should tender his unconditional submission to Government. Mohain immediately responded by unbelting his sword and handing it to the Resident, who, pleased at this spontaneous act of submisson, returned the sword to Mohsin. Mohsin’s own views. The Resident then permitted Mohsin to proceed with his history. Mohsin alluded to the incident of the dhow. He stated that on heaving that a buggalow had been wrecked off Balahaf he proceeded to the port to render the necessary assistance. He arrived at Balahaf and made all arrangements for the safety and comfort of the crew. Thereafter, finding that the men had specie with them, he made enquiries as to its ownership and learnt that it did not belong to any one on board the dhow, but that some belonged to merchants in Aden and some to persons in Mokalla. Mobsin then took charge of the specie with a view to its eventual delivery to the proper owners, and advised the crew to wait, as it would he difficult and unsafe to go by sea owing to the monsoon. The men, however, did not wait, but reported against him both at Mokalla and Aden. Meanwhile, as there was no safe place to keep the large sum of money at Balahaf, he took the specie with him to Azzan. Some time after, in reference to this matter, he received a letter at Azzan asking him to meet the Resident at Balahaf. Though he could not travel at the same rate as the runner who brought the letter, he proceeded as fast as he could with the money, but only to hear, when he was some distance off Balahaf, the bombard ment of the port. He learnt also that his brother Ahmed bin Saleh had gone on board the steamer, offered to remain as a hostage till he (Mobsin) had brought the money, and besought the officers to wait and not demolish the fort. Ahmed bin Saleh was told that orders had already been received from Government, and the demolition of the fort was proceeded with in spite of the entreaties of Ahmed bin Saleh, who protested that the great Government would under no circumstances act so hastily. Bearing all this Mohsin was afraid and returned to Azzan with the money. Shortly after this, in reply to a letter from him enquiring as to the reason why the authorities had acted in this manner, he received a letter stating that the fort of Balahaf had been destroyed as a punishment for the act of piracy committed on the sambook from which a large sum of money had been looted, and announcing that the port of Balahaf would be closed and his brother Ahmed bin Saleh would be detained pending restitution of the plundered property. The specie was returned in due coarse through his own men, who brought back news, however, that Ahmed bin Saleh would not be released till he had personally come into Aden and submitted. The Sultanate. At this stage of the interview the Resident asked Mohsin why he declines to submit to Saleh bin Abdulla, and on what conditions he would be prepared to accord such submission. Mohsin scorned the very idea. He stated that Saleh bin Abdulla was a mere nonentity and was absolutely useless in the administration of the country ; that his only business was to come to Aden from time to time and to receive his stipend and such other presents as the 20Resident was disposed to give ; and that he (Mohsin) could never think of submitting to such a man. He urged that h e was the actual ruler during the past fourteen years, and that he was the only Sultan who was recognised by the tribesmen, and that therefore Government should accord their recognition to his Sultanate. It was then explained to him that the Resident himself was , not aware of the views of Government on this particular point, and that it was not certain that Government w r ould recognise him, having regard to his past conduct. Mohsin then earnestly declared that it was never his intention to disobey Government, of whose mighty power he was well aware, that it was fear that prevented him from coming, that he is now submissive, as he always wished to be, to Government and would continue to he so and would even “ give his own head ” for Government. Should, however, Government be not disposed to recognise Mohsin, he wished that he should not be held responsible for anything. It was then pointed out to him that he should not be at the bottom of any trouble, as the great Government had a long arm and w T ould strike hard. To this he agreed, but he again repeated that he was the only Chief recognised by the tribesmen, and that he was the only one who could arrange the tribal affair to their satisfaction. Here the interview practically ended, but with a view to ascertain how Mohsin would regard the situation in the event of Government according the Sultanate to Ahmed bin Saleh, the Resident incidentally asked Mohsin whether he was fond of his elder brother Ahmed, and he replied that he was fond of him, but gave no indication from which it could be inferred that he would either agree or absolutely refuse to accept the Sultanate of Ahmed bin Saleh Mohsin was thereupon further ques tioned that if he was fond of his brother, as he professed to be, why he did not come in and submit before this so as to secure his brother’s release earlier. He replied that he was afraid that if he did come he would also have been imprisoned along with his brother. After making one or two requests, the chief one being that as he had come in and submitted his brother should be given some freedom to move about, to which the Resident assented, Mohsin took his departure, promising to remain in Aden till such time as the orders of Government were received. Letter No. 8010, dated the 29th Deceanher 1904, From—C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political .Resident, Aden. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 204, dated the 11th December 1904, relative to affairs at Balahaf. 2. In reply I am to request that you will submit, for the information of Government, the record referred to in paragraph 3 of your letter, showing that Mohsin was informed that his brother Ahmed bin Saleh w r ould be detained until the $6,020 which Mohsin had taken from the dhow wdiich was wrecked near Balahhaf had been paid, and to request, with reference to paragraph 2 of this Department letter No. 7538, dated the 15th October 1902, and paragraph 19 of vour office letter No. 196, dated the 19th July 1902, and letter No. 378, dated the 4th December 1902, that you will explain (1) why you consider that the payment of $6,020 represented “ restitution in full of the stolen property (2) how any promise of the kind you refer to could have been given to Mohsin in view of the orders of Government and Brigadier- General Maitland’s reply thereto; (3) why you consider that Government should accept the statements made by Mohsin in spite of his letters at the time to Sultan Ghalib and his then action as reported by the Political Resident; (4) how vou reconcile Mohsin’s ' complete ” submission -with his refusal to submit to the arrangements at Balahaf made by the Sheikhs in 1894 and confirmed by Government in 1895. 3.1 am at the same time to observe that the orders of the Government of India on which this Department letter No. 7638, dated the 16th October 1902, 21 344FD22 was based, require the complete submission of Mohsin to the existing position and guarantees for his future good conduct, and that he will do his utmost to co-operate in maintaining the position sanctioned by Government, unless it is altered with their approval and sanction. The Governor in Council would be glad to learn what Mohsin proposes to do to satisfy Government on this point and what guarntees he proposes to furnish that his own conduct is loyal and good, and that his influence on the tribe is used to maintain the existing order. His Excellency in Council cannot place much value on a submission which is simply a candidature for the titular Chiefship of the tribe and a disclaimer of all responsibility, if unsuccessful ; and Mohsin should be given to understand that he will be held responsible for his personal conduct. 4. I am also to request that you will furnish Government with an exact statement of the terms and promises on which Mohsin is at present at Aden, together with a copy of the letter on which he came in. 5. In conclusion, I am to invite a perusal of Brigadier-General Jopp's letter No. 20, dated the 5th May 1894, especially paragraph 11 and accompani ment E, and to enquire whether the shares in Balahaf are still distributed on the same basis, and who would now be competant to bind the tribe by a docu ment such as Appendix F, to that letter. Letter No. 142, dated the 9th January 1905. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To C., H. A. Hill, Lsq., C.I, E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to your letter No. 8010, dated the 29th December 1904, relative to the affairs of Balahaf, I have the honour to forward, herewith, a copy of the translation of the letter dated the 13th August 1902, written to Mohsin bin Saleh by the then acting Resident, Lieutenant-Colonel Abud, in which Mohsin was informed that Ahmed bin Saleh would not he released until the looted specie was restored. I enclose also copies of translation of letters sent to Saleh Abdulla and Ahmed bin Saleh to a similar effcet. The above promise, it will be seen, was conveyed to Mohsin long before the receipt of the orders of Government, which were dated the 15th October 1902, and did not reach Aden till the 2ord idem. 2. The whole of the looted specie consisting of 6,020 and Rs. 140 was paid back in November. As to why the payment of the said amount should be regarded as restitution in full of the stolen property, I would explain that though in the letter of 13th August 1902, alluded to above, reference is made to other goods besides the specie, the subsequent negotiations related only to the restitution of, the specie. This was presumably because of the uncertainty as to what became of the other goods, as will appear from paragraph 19 of Lieutenant-Colonel Abud’s letter No. 196, dated the 19th July 1902. 3. In regard to the third query in your letter, enquiring why I consider that Government should accept statements made by Mohsin in spite of his letters at the time of the wreck to Sultan Ghalib and his then action as reported by the Political Resident, I would venture to observe that the purport of Mohsin’s statements is that before the bombardment of the port of Balahaf he was not given sufficient opportunity to explain his action in reference to the wreck and to restore the specie, which he was all along willing to surrender. This contention is not a new one, hut he has maintained it from the very com mencement as will appear from his letters to this Residency, dated the 25th July and 7th September 19U2 (copies of translations enclosed). Of course, in the letters to Sultan Ghalib referred to by Government, Mohsin appears to have spoken of surrendering the money if he were allowed to retain a share of it. To this he lias made no reference in his present statement, but it seems to me that in writing to the above effect to Sultan Ghulib he really meant only to claim salvage money like other Chiefs on the coast, as will be evident from his letter of.7th September 1902 cited above. It appears to me, therefore, that there is sincerity in Mohsin’s explanation.■1 * A f S /° l i 0W * rf&gt;C0nC] '' e Mohdn’s complete Submission with his refusal t° submit to the arrangements at fialahaf made by the Sheikhs in 1894 and y T nme , at - ml ? 95 &gt;I^o^ysaythat he has now seen the err r of ins ways by realizing the power of Government, the magnitude of which I took great care to impress upon him both in my letter asking him to come in and also at the interviews I had with him. It would appear on enquiry from Sultan Abdulla bin Hussian and Abdul Kadir bin Abdul Latif and other Sheikhs, who are all present with me, that Mohsin bin Saleh was not deposed as stated in the document (marked F, herewith attached, with translation for the perusal of Government). The two Sheikhs mentioned by name also state on icing shown the document that they never saw it previous to this, and that then- signatures are forged. I have taken their signatures which are absolutely dillerentfrom those in the document. It will be seen that the signatures on the document are in the hand-writing of one person, which seems to prove that the document is a fictitious one. However this may be, from all the conversa tions I have had with Mohsin I fully believe that he really means to be loyal and submissive to Government, and the reluctance that he has manifested to accent the present Sultanate is due more to a sense of pride, making it difficult f0r JVjV 0 servreunder a iaan who is a mere puppet, rather than a wish to be a eondidate for the titular Chiefship. He has, however, now promised that he will submit to the existing position, that is, as the Sultanate now stands, if Govern ment are disinclined to alter it, that his future conduct will be loyal and good, that he will co-operate to the utmost in maintaining the position sanctioned by Government : and as a guarantee of his assurance he has agreed to give the only security he is in a position to offer, viz., that one of his two brothers, Ahmed and Busen, and he himself will each remain at a time in Aden, Husen taking his turn first and his own turn being undertaken within three months from the date of his return to Balahaf after the receipt of the orders of Govern ment, as he requires time to arrange about his private affairs. 5. The exact terms and promises on which Mohsin is at present in Aden will be apparent from the letter which t wrote to him asking him to come in (copy enclosed). 6. As to the shares in the port of Balahaf, I read out to Sultan Abdulla Hasan named above the list given in paragraph 11 of General Jopp*s letter No. 20, dated the 5th May lfe94. He failed to understand the distribu tion therein given and stated that it w^s incorrect, and that the original distri bution was as shown in the accompanying staternent. But he explained that subsequently, about six years ago, a re-distribution took place which is shown below the statement mentioned above, the documents pertaining to that distri bution being written in his own hand. 7. With reference to the concluding portion of the last paragraph of your letter under reply, I would add that in view of what has been stated above it seems to me that there will be nodody competent forthcoming to bind the tribe by a document similar to document F df 1891.

You know full well that your conduct in not tendering your submission, when you were asked to do so, has been greatly displeasing to the British Government. Yet the great Government were good enough to order us to come and see you in your own country, so that we might personally ascertain and report all that you had to say regarding your behaviour. But this inter view cannot take place here as we have already said above. Your only course now is to come to Aden and see us. This you must do within three weeks of the date of this letter. Bailing this, you know what the power of the great Government can do. They will be compelled to renew the blockade of Balahaf, and possibly to take such measures as may be necessary to compel your ejection from Balahaf territory. This is the last chance that Government are giving you, and you will be acting wisely in taking advantage of it. If you come to Aden I guarantee your safe conduct, and your personal liberty will not be interfered with. This is our word, and you may put faith in it. We must, however, tell you that when you come to Aden it will be necessary for you to remain there till such time as the orders of Government are received. We will talk more fully about matters when you come to us, which we hope you will do without fail. May you be preserved. (Signed) H. M.

Hill, Esq, C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombav&gt; Political Department. *' In continuation of my telegram of to-day’s date, I have the honour to state that at the interview which I had with Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh at the time of writing my letter No. 142, dated the 9th January 1905, regarding Balahaf affairs, he reported to me that he had received information that, taking advantage of his absence, Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla had clandestinely sold a portion of Balahaf to His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. He seemed to view the news with some alarm. But I set his mind at rest by savins that I did not credit the rumour, as nothing of the kind could happen without the know ledge or consent of this Residency. The news has, however, been • Appendix A. confirmed by Sultan Ghalib, who has , , . „ , , written* tome saying that a settlement has been arrived at between Saleh bin Abdullah and himself, wherebv the formerhassold to him half of Balahaf and Jila’, together with their depend encies on the sea-coast and inland, that a document has been drawn up o-ivin^ eilect to the transaction, and that nothing remains to be done except to° have t Appendix b. m y signature on the document in token rnori + i ,i ■ -j. , of confirmation. I have repliedt to Sultan Griialio to the effect that I cannot confirm such an agreement which has been entered into without my knowledge or consent, and that I am therefore reporting the matter to Government for orders. 2. Having regard to the opinion expressed by the Government o^ India m paragraph z of Foreign Department letter No. 1094-E.A., dated the 5th July i ie ? m ^ P reamble Government Resolution No. 4653, dated • j U ^ ^ seems me fh a t Sultan Ghalib should have apprised this Residency beforehand of the fact that the above negotiations were in contemplation, even though Saleh bin Abdulla did not care to disclose it. Moreover, the transaction in question, if accepted by Government, will, I am certain, give rise to constant friction between the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla ^ the P ort °f Balahaf, particularly as the sale of Saleh bin Abdullas share has been effected without the knowledge and approval of the latter. I would, therefore, recommend that Government should not accord their confirmation to the transaction. ,A.

P. Since telegraphing to you on the ISth January 1905 which reported purchase by Sultan Ghalib of Sultan Saleh’s share of the port of Balahaf, Mohsin has produced before me a letter which purports to have been written by Sultan Ghalib to the Customs official at Balahaf informing him of the purchase and of his intention to visit Balahaf shortly and ordering him to have accounts of Customs dues ready. Sultan Ghalib may have written this letter before receipt of mine, which refused to recognise the purchase pending the receipt of the orders from the Bombay Government. On the 27th instant 4 29 341FD/ IW' ✓ {/ Jlohsin sliowed me another letter from some of his principal tribesmen expressing alarm at the rumour of the purchase of Balahaf and stated their intention to resort to armed opposition.

We have received your letter dated the 30th Shawal 1322 in which you tell us about the sale of your share in Balahaf and Jila to the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. This information we had already received from Sultan Ghalib and we wrote to you at the time that the matter was being reported to Government. The Great Government now desire that you should explain how it is that you sold your share without letting them know in accordance with your treaty obligations. This explanation is urgently required by Government and we would ask you to send it at once. We would advise you, oh friend, as we have done in our previous letter, that pending the receipt of final orders of Government about Balahaf affairs you should preserve the peace. May you be preserved. Translation of a letter dated El Hijja 1322 (February 1905). From— Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla, the Wahidi of Balahaf, To— Major-Gineral H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden. Know, oh friend, that we have visited Balahaf with 100 men, consisting of Sheikhs and tribesmen, whom Abdul Rab had seen. They told us that Government did not want us nor it required us to visit Aden. They put us off by your words from coming to Aden. Subsequently we went to the Kaiti, who is under your protection, your friend, and has a treaty with you, and in so doing we have not gone to a Foreign Government and we have not com mitted any faithless act against you As to your letter to our address, directing us not to create any disturbance, we are under your command and under the Government and we are your children. But we fear that the faithless Mohsin bin Saleh and his brothers, who committed bad deeds against you, us, and the poor, would construct buildings at Balahaf, w’hen, on the other hand, you have prevented us from creating any disturbance. Your order is on our heads and we place our possession at Balahaf under security of God and our master Jesus Christ as w f ell as the great British Government. No one assisted the great Government in the matter of the new treaty, which was written on the large sheets of paper, except ourselves. Mohsin and his brother Ahmed had gone tothe French, and afterwards Ahmed was imprisoned Until the time he entered into treaty, but again l» e became faithless. We write this letter with a request that your reply may be directed to our address at Majdaha or Mokalla. May you be preserved. Translation of a letter, dated 30tli Shawal 1322'(6tb J anuaiy 1905 ).

Oh friend we have already sent you a letter informing you of what happened, of the bad deeds of Sultnn Mohsin bin Saleh and hisVother Ahmed Saleh, and their treachery against Government when they went to the French and the Turks. Subsequently we entered Aden (and went) to the Resident and concluded a new treaty with Government on the large sheets ol paper, and Ahmed bin Saleh was included in the treaty. Then he and his brother made treachery at sea by plundering considerable property from the poor on the sea and the poor were oppressed. Afterwards the disturbance and quarrel took place between us and them for your sake. Now when they observed the false is from you they brought Bedouins and spies by money and gave you false evidence. Know, oh friend, that we are not willing, that neither Mohsm bin Saleh nor his brother should extend their hands on our land and property nor have any hand or interference with our possessions. Know oh friend, that we have sold the half of Balahaf and of Jila and all what belon-s to us on the coast to Sultan Ghalib bin Awadth, the Kaiti, and we are willino- and satisfied with the final [some unintelligible word] sale. We address vou h T l ie ^ eed of sale is sent by the hand of Syed Husen preserved * 0r tlie S1 g na ture of the Resident thereon. May you be j we inform th® exalted Great Government that we have sold and dedicated to Sultan Ghalib bin Awadth, the Kaiti, half of Balahaf and half of Jila as contained in the deed of sale. The dedication is such that can be violence * 1 immediately and we are freely willing to the same without force or We are in the healthy condition of body and mind and our writing is witness against us. Letter No. 1806, dated the 18tli March 1905. From-^-C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bom bay, Political Department, To— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1094, dated the 2fith lebruary last, wdth which you forwarded a translation submitted by Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla of his recent transaction with Sultan Ghalib for the sale of his share of the port of Balahaf. 2. The explanation is no explanation at all, hut Sultan Saleh’s letters indicate, or appear to indicate, that he was anxious to part with his share because he felt he might he unable to hold it against Sultan Mohsin. The suggestion that treaty obligations did not apply in this matter because Saltan Glmlib was not a foreigner cannot of course be accepted. The question that action should be taken depends upon a variety of considerations and upon further information as to the degree of interest in the port of Balahaf with part of which Sultan Saleh has endeavoured to part. In regard to this latter point, I am to request that you will report clearly and definitely whether the so-called share in the port of Balahaf is merely the share in Customs receipt or whether they include further shares in the administration of the village bf Balahaf and other territorial rights. An early report upon this point is requested. 323. I am at the same time to request your opinion as to the course which in the light of further information which may be submitted in reply to the last paragraph and of the summary of the case which follows should be pursued. The position of affairs at the present moment appears to be as follows “ Sultan Saleh, whom, since 1894, we have recognised as the titular Sultan and whose recognition as such we have endeavoured to enforce, hns not only, during the whole of that time, failed, adequately to impress his authority upon the tribesmen and to maintain order in the Sultanate, but has no w, in direct violation of the terms of the treaty concluded with Balahaf, entered upon an agreement with Shehr and Mokalla to sell his share in the port of Balahaf. Meanwhile Sultan Mobsin, who, between the years 1894 and 1902, had managed to re-assert a preponderating share in the authority over the tribes and in the administration, and who, as a result of the unlawful seizure of the dhow Fateh al Salam in 1902, was required to tender his submission and pay up in full the amount plundered from the dhow, has at last come into Aden, tendered his submission in full, undertaken to abide by the existing order of things, should the Government be determined to maintain them, and has offered fairly satisfactory guarantees of his intention to abide by his under taking. His brother Ahmed has, therefore, been released. Luring the inter val the port of Balahaf has, as a coercive measure, been from time to time closed more or less effectually, and this closure has no doubt had its influence upon the ultimate submission of Mohsin. ,, 4. The question now for determination are— (1) whether the settlement come to in 1894 and reiterated in 190 ^ but which has never been effectually carried into operation, should be enforced ; and (2) if so, what arrangements should be made in order to ensure that its maintenance should be made effectual. The situation kns been materially changed by the action hotli of Sultan Mohsin and of Sultan Ghalib. The present seems to be an opportunity of re-considering the arrangements approved by the Government of India in 1&amp;94. The first essential condition of any settlement would have to be the recogni tion by whoever may be appointed titular Sultan, of the fact that he is so appointed with the sanction only of Government and that his position will only he recognised during the pleasure of Government, that is to say, so long as he observes the obligations which follow such recognition. It seems in these circumstances to he a question whether the proper course would not he to summon to Aden the Sheikhs w ho may be shareholders in the port of Balahaf in order that they may elect, in the Resident’s presence, their Sultan whose name would then he reported to Government for approval. Whoever might be selected, the opportunity could be taken not only to re-affirm the existing treaty, but to obtain (a) from the individual Sheikhs a written undertaking that they w r ould abide by their selection loyally; and (b) from this nominee documentary admission of the fact that his nomination was valid only during the pleasure of the British Government. W ketker the interest which Sultan. Ghaiib has endeavoured to establish by his transac tion with Sultan Saleh should or should not be held to jutify the consider ation of his claims or possibly to require his presence at Aden at the time when the Sheikhs will be summoned is a matter upon which the Governor in Council will be glad to be furnished with your opinion. No. 2241, dated Aden Residency, the 16th April 1905. From—M ajor-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to Government of Bombay, Political Department. In reference to your No. 1806, dated the 18th ultimo, concerning Balahaf affairs, I have the honour to inform you that I am arranging for my First Assistant Resident to visit Balahnf on the 1st proximo, with a view to holding 33 344]? Da local inquiry into the rights of the family concerned over the Port, and also with a view to ascertaining on the spot the wishes of all the members of the family and of the Sheikhs and Akils of the wahidi both in regard to the Sultanship and the true interests of the port of Balahaf. 2. I am directing my First Assistant Resident after holding this enquiry to bring the leading Akils and Sheikhs concerned into Aden with a view to an ultimate settlement of their affairs being arrived at here, subject of coarse to the final approval of Government, to whom a full report will be submitted upon the conclusion of the inquiry. 3. Meanwhile in reference to the degree of interest in the port of Balahaf with which Sultan Saleh has endeavoured to part, I have the honour to invite reference to the deeds of sale submitted to Government with this office No. 626 of the 9th February 1P05, wherein reference is made to the famous and well known half of the port of Balahaf and of the port of Khisat Jal’a together with all rights of administration and suzerainty on the coast and inland on all sides of the port, and also to paragraph 6 of this office letter No. 200, dated 27th November 1904, where it was reported as the result of personal inquiry then made that half the customs dues were sent to Sultan Saleh and half to Mohsin. 4. From the statement appended to this office letter No. 142, dated 9th January 1905, it would, however, appear that Sultan Saleh’s share in the port was formerly ^th and is now only j^ths. And further local inquiry thus seems advisable to clear up remaining doubts on this particular point. 5. I have further the honour to invite consideration of the fact that the deeds of sale above referred to mention “all rights of administration and suzerainty on the coast and inland on all sides of the port,” but that in this office letter No. 200, dated 27th November 1904, the port is described as the ruins of a fort and a few huts built of mats and it is there stated that the port was maintained merely as a custom post for the collection of dues on exports and imports such as camel’s hair cloth, jowari and kerosine oil, and that only about 20 to 30 men w r ere ordinarily stationed there for collection of those dues. The proposed further local inquiry will, it is hoped, clear up any remaining doubts as to rights of suzerainty and administration included in the so-called shares in the port of Balahaf. * At-** , No. 3476, dated Bombay Castle, the 3rd June 1905. From—The Hon’ble Mr. S. W. Edgerliy, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Govern ment of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 2780, dated the 3rd May 1905, I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 2952, dated 21st May 1905, and of its enclosures, together with copy of a telegram from the Resident dated the 15th ultimo, and of my reply thereto, dated the 17th idem, on the subject of affairs at Balahaf. 2. It is not necessary for His Excellency the Governor in Council to write at any length. The position of affairs has been very thoroughly cleared up by Captain Hancook’s thorough enquiry, and it is clear that the Sheikhs of the Wahidi tribe are unanimous in their resolution to depose Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla and to recognise Mohsin bin Saleh as their titular Sultan. It is clear also that, in the opinion of the Resident at Aden, Sultan Mohsin alone has in fluence to hold the tribe together, and that whatever influence Sultan Saleh previously had has been sacrificed by Ins negotiations with Sultan Ghalib of Shehr and Mokalla. That being so His Excellency the Governor in Council would recommend that accomplished facts be accepted and that Sultan Mohsin be recognised as titular Sultan of the Wahidi tribe of Balahaf and that the stipend due to the titular Sultan should be paid to him. It is not necessary for Government to consider at present how he will distribute the stipend to other 3435 sharers, nor what the shares in the revenue should he, nor how Sultan Saleh hin Abdulla will satisfy Sultan Ghalib of Shehr and Mokalla as regards the negotiation which he will now be unable to carry to conclusion. No. 2952, dated Aden Residency, the 21st May 1905. From—M a joe-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In continuation of my letter No. 2211, dated the 16th April 1905, and with reference to your telegram, dated the 17th May 1905, regarding Balahaf affairs I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a memorandum submit ted to me by Capt lin F. de B. Hancock, my First Assistant, whom I deputed on the 7th May to proceed to Balahaf in the It. I. M. S. “ Elphinstoneand make local enquiries on the points which Government in their letter No. 1806, dated the 18th March 1905, required to be further elucidated. 2. Captain Hancock has taken considerable pains to go minutely into the whole question and the result of his enquiries has been to confirm my own views that Mohsin bin Saleh is the only man capable of being the Saltan of the Wahidi of Balahaf. At the two interviews I have had with the principal Sheikhs and Sayids of the tribe on the 15th and 19th instant, notes of w hich are herein enclosed, they have been unanimous in their support of Mohsin as the titular Sultan and at the second of the interviews have signed a document, herewith forwarded, signifying, their desire that Saleh bin Abdulla should be for mally deposed in favour of Mohsin bin Saleh whom they select for the chiefship, and expressing their consent to abide loyally by their selection if the same receives the sanction of Government. 3. As to the nature of the revenues of Balahaf also the memorandum confirms my views. They consist merely of the customs receipts of the port, inclusive of certain transit dues, wdiich it transpires that formally Mohsin col lected at Al Hauta but are now amalgamated with the Balahaf dues. No ter ritorial or other rights are included beyond the right of obtaining fuel and water for Balahaf from the village of Jala’a and the rights of salvage of any wrecks that may occur on the strip of shore in the vicinity. 4. All the Sultans of Balahaf however have, irrespective of their shares in the revenues of the port of Balahaf, certaiu territorial rights in the interior of the country ; and from the deeds of sale passed to the Kayti it w’ould appear that Sultan Saleh bin Abdull t has endeavoured to part, nor only with his share in the revenues of the port of Balahaf, but also with some such territorial rights, For in the documents reference is made to the “ famous and well-known half of the port of Balauaf and of the port Kisat Jala’a together with all rights of administration and suzerainty on the coast and inland on all sides of the port.” The acquisition of such territorial lights must presumably have been in the mind of Sultan Ghalib when negotiating for the purchase of Sultan Saleh Abdulla’s share in tbe Balahaf revenues. Such alienation of territorial rights without the previous consent of Government is an open violation of Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla’s treaty obligations, while, on the other hand, the extension of territory of the Kayti implied on the above alienation was a matter of which Sultan Ghalib should, it seems to me, in view of the opinion expressed by the Government of India in paragraph 2 tof Foreign Department letter No. 1094- E. A., dated the 5th July 1897, to which I have already drawn attention in paragraph 2 of my letter No. 260, dated the 23th January 1905, have duly ap prised this Residency beforehand. Moreover, the vehemence with which the Wahidi tribesmen of Balahaf repudiate the very idea of alienation of any portion of their territory to the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, whose policy of territorial extension they seem to view with alarm, leads me to believe that there will be trouble in the event of the sale of Sultan Saleh’s share being actually given effect to. I therefore reiterate my opinion that the transaction should not be confirmed by Government. Even were it otherwise, that no alienation of territory was involved and Sultan Saleh simply parted with his share in the36 customs due's of Balaliaf, I would still not recommend the confirmation of the transaction. Por, as I have already said in one of my earlier letters, it is sure to give rise to constant friction between the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla and the co-sharers of Balahaf, as well as all the tribesmen of the Wahidi country. 5. In regard to the present distribution of the shares in the port of Balahaf, Captain Hancock has gone into the matter at length, but I am unable to form any definite opinion as to the actual share of Saleh bin Abdulla as there seem to be certain factors which have given rise to complication. This point, how ever, seems to be immaterial to the settlement of the unsatisfactory state of affairs which has hitherto existed in Balahaf, and I agree vith Captain Han cock in thinking that there is no reason for us to settle this private dispute regarding the shares and that the proper mode of settlement would be for the Sultans to refer the matter to the arbitration of some of their leading Sayids. 6. I enclose also, for the information of Government, notes of interview of the final interview I have had with Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla on the 20th. May 1005. MEMORANDUM. Balahaf Affairs. In accordance with instructions, 1 left Aden on the morning of the 7th instant by the U. I. M. S. “ Elphinstone ” and arrived at Balahaf shortly before noon on the following day. 2. In the early afternoon, I interviewed the leading Mansab of Habban and his cousin, ris., Sayid Salim bin Ahmed bin Ali bin Umar al Mehdthar and Savid Kas’m bin AH bin Hussain bin Ali bin Umar al Mehdthar. This particular family of Mansabs has frequently been referred to in previous records of the Besidency since 1887, and is one of the leading families of Sayids who, as reported in Major Hunter’s account of the Arab tribes in the vicinity of Aden, exert great influence amongst the Wahidi tribes. Habban was in former days the recognized capital of the Wahidi country and the seat of Government and is still the largest and most important town in the district. 3. A little later, I interviewed two of the actual collectors of the customs of the port, named Saleh bin Saeed bin Jarba and Hussein bin Abdulla bin Husein bin Saleh, the latter of whom is a distant relation of the family of Sultans. And after I had discussed the affairs of the port for some little time with them, 1 interviewed all the Sultans of Balahaf (except Husein, who was left in Aden) and the Sultan of Bir Ali. Those present at this interview were— Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla of Balahaf. Sultan Hadi bin Saleh of Balahaf. Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh of Balahaf. Sultan Ahmed bin Saleh of Balahaf. Sultan Saleh bin Ahmed of Bir Ali. Abdulla bin Hussein, a cousin of the Sultans of Balahaf. Sayid Omar bin Salim bin Aidaroos, a companion and supporter of Sultan Mohsin. 4. The interview lasted for some time and was rather difficult as it was constantly interrupted by mutual recriminations between the Sultan. Sultan Hadi bin Saleh was evidently non compos mentis and Sultan Mohsin and Sultan Sahh of Balahaf were both at times violent and troublesome. 5. On the following morning I landed at Balahaf in company with Lieutenant Hamilton of the B. I. M. S. “ Elphinstone ’* and Lieutenant Hart of the Boval Garrison Artillery. I took an escort of six sepoys of the 94th Bussell's Infantry under their Jemadar Sayid Jacoob who mounted an independent guard over the fort which Sultan Mohsin has lately repaired and where I held all the morning’s interviews. The escort behaved through out the morning with excellent steadiness, and great credit is due to them and also to the officers and crew of the E. 1. M. S. “ Elphinstone ” for the entire absence of friction that attended all the proceedings.344UD 37 6. All the Sultans and tribesmen were drawn up in a lone row alone the shore to receive me. Upon landing I shook hands and exchanged a few words with some of them and then proceeded into the fort, where I proceeded to again interview the Sultans and Sayids and all the leading Sheikhs of the various tribes who had assembled at Balahaf for the occasion, The following is the list of the Sheikhs whom I interviewed, and from inquiries made on the represented 1 --— n&lt;!&lt; * ^ ^ t10 ma j ority of tlie tribes 'ere fully and properly (1) Sheikh Saeed bin Naeir A] Jasari, the Sad al Habban. The most important Sheikh Habban nCt0f HabbaU ' He has about 400 followers or more and lives near (2) Sheikh Said bin Salim Suedan of the Sad al Sha' ab. an important leader of the tribe of Sad al Sha’ab. He has over a hundred followers and lives north of Amakm in the Habban district. (3) Sheikh Mansoor bin Nashir Al Habtoor. He has about 106 followers and lives not far from Libya in the Azzan district at what was known as the Gbel Al baidi. (4) Sheikh Naaif bin Mohsin of the Ahl Omar bin Ali, who lives near Al Rawdthar and has about 50 followers. (5) Sheikh Muhammad bin Awadth of the tribe of Ba Dayan, who lives south of Hauta in the Habban district and has a following of about 200 men. (6) Sheikh Awadth bin Hadi Al Sulemani, leader of the tribes of the Hamyar, who lives in the hills near the coast in the Dhuyaibi district and has an immediate personal following of about 300 men and great influence over all the coast tribes between Irka and BalaLaf. (*) Sheikh Mansa bin Salem of the tribe of Al Abdali, who has a following of about 150 men and lives at Ain Ba Mabad. (8) Salem bin Abdulla bin Lasal of the tribe Ba Auda, who has a following of about 200 men and lives between Azzam and the coast. In regard to this Sheikh it wa* admitted that his cousin Ali bin Awadth was the most influential leader of th^ tribe, but it was said that he had sent his cousin to represent him vide Arabic Department 117 of 16th May 1903. (9) Nasir bin Salim bin Laswad of the Komasbi tribe who has a following of about 680 and lives south of Habban. (10) Awadth bin Muhammad of the Ba Kutmi who numbers over 100 men and lives Hear Hawil Bil Arab. (11) Ahmed bin Ali bin Tawil of the Said Al Sha’ab who numbers about 200 followers and lives near Amakin. (12) Salim bin Saeed Al Suweder of the Ahl Hayasam who also lives near Amakin and numbers about 150 men. (13) Hasan bin Naser of the Ahl Fahide who lives in Amakin and is the leader of 150 soldiers. (14) Saeed bin Salem bin Rashid who lives at Raida and has 100 followers. (15) Abdulla bin Saeed bin Baneit w-ho has 100 followers up in the north of the Maifah Wadi. (16) Mehdi bin Abdulla Ba Kutmi who lives at Jirdan and had 120 followers. (17) Ahmed bin Omar Al Admi who lives north-east of Hura and has a few hundred followers. 7. All except the last four of the Sheikhs were strong supporters of Mohsin bin Saleh as Sultan of the Wahidis and the last four, who said what they had come at Sultan Saleh’s special request, did not express themselves in favour of Sultan Saleh, but said that they really did not mind who was elected and would not consider themselves subject to any one. Some of the other Sheikhs similarly claimed actual independence, but nevertheless supported Sultan Mohsin’s election. All the Sultans and Sheikhs were strongly opposed to the idea of any alteration of any part of Balahaf to the Kayti. One of them, Ahmed bin Umar of the Ali Admi tribe, offered to name any Sultan I chose for money.8, After these interviews I returned onboard the R. I. M.S.“Elphin- stone ” and was followed in the afternoon by the Sultans, Sayids, and some of the leading Sheikhs whom I asked to accompany me to Aden to see the Kesidency. We sailed from Balahaf at 5 p. M. on the 9th instant and arrived at Aden about 5 p. M. on the afternoon of the 10th. I had further inter views with some of the Sultans and Sheikhs on the wav into Aden, and have since arrival had further conversations with several of them connected with the subject of my inquiry and the examination of the documentary evidence produced. The names of the party who accompanied me to Aden are as follows:— 1. Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh, 2 . Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla, 3. Sultan Abdulla bin Husein, 4.

Since return to Aden I have also interviewed a few of the leading mer chants of the town of Habban previously referred to as the old capital of the ahidi country and I have, 1 think, on the whole fully tapped all possible sources of information on the subject into which my orders were to inquire, with the following result. 10. As to the feeling of the Sultans and Sheikhs of the TV ahidi on the subject of the sultanate, there is I think no doubt that all the more important 38of these are in favour of the election of Sultan Mohsin bin S deb as titular Sultan. I hare not heard a single word from anybody in support of Sultan oaleh bin Abdulla. Sultan Saleh has evidently no personal influence over the tribes and has forfeited any that he may have ever had by his recent transaction with the Kayti. lie alone constitutes the only opponent to the election of Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh. 11. Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh, on the other hand, has considerable personal influence over the tribes and, as far as I have been able to ascertain, alone has power to exercise any real control over them. This influence he has established in the course of the past ten years by natural force of character and strength of action. 12. It was in 18^5 that Sultan Hadi bin Nasir of Balahaf, his elder brother was elected to occupy the position of titular Sultan of the Wahidi. He, it is to be noted, was the third of the Sultans of Balahaf to occupy this dual posi tion, his predecessors being JN'asir, bin Abdulla, the first Sultan of Balahaf, and Ahmad bin Nasir his son. They, it will be remembered, were first granted sole enjoyment of the revenues of Balahaf for themselves and their successors by Sultan Abdulla, the eighth Sultan of the Wahidi, upon their fortifying the post. 13. And it was very shortly after 1885 that, after a troubled and precarious rule for a brief period only, Sultan Hadi proved himself incompetent to fill the position to which he had been elected and was entirely ousted by his younger and more enterprising brother, Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh. 14. During the next few years various troubles arose between Sultan Mohsin and the tribes and inhabitants of the old capital of Habhan. These were mainly due to disputes concerning the property tax “ Ashur” to a share in which Sultan Mohsin laid a claim which was resisted by the inhabitants ; a certain influential merchant of Habban of the family of Alaiwas being one of his most vigorous opponents. And it was in oonsequence of these troubles that Mohsin first made an ineffectual appeal to the Aden Residency, and then had resort to the Upper Aulaki tribe, with whose assistance he reinstated himself at Habban, but with whom he afterwards himself quarrelled owing to their attempt to, in their turn, secure a share in the very property tax which was at the bottom of all the troubles. 15. The eventual outcome of those disturbances was that Sultan Mohsin was compelled to vacate the old capital of Habban, and to reside instead at the neighbouring town of Azzan which he has ever since made his head-quarters. A descendant of another branch of the ruling family named Nasir bin Saleh was invited to occupy the old seat of Government at Habban and to this day occupies the position of Sultan of that town, and receives a share not of the old property tax but of the customs dues. This Sultan Nasir, however, is now evidently a nominal Sultan only. He is generally admitted to be a practical nonentity and to only occupy his present position at Habban on sufferance. 16. Sultan Mohsin’s fresh application for assistance to the Aden Residency which was refused in 1894, and the refusal of which led to his intrigues with the French and Turks and culminated in the conclusion of the treaty of 1895, in which Mohsin was not included as a signatory are comparatively modern history. In 1901, it will be remembered, that the Sultans of Balahaf including Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla, and various other Sheikhs of the Wahidi wished Sultan Mohsin to be recognised as titular Sultan and that their request was negatived in Government Resolution, Political Department, No. 2845, dated 16th April 1906. Recent events connected with the loot of the buggalow “ Fateh-al-Salam ” I need not here recapitulate. 17. The main fact is that Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh has throughout all vicissitudes maintained a position of supremacy in Balahaf affairs and of com parative supremacy throughout the Wahidi country which he still occupies 39and that he is really the only nominee for the tribal sultanate whom the Bedawin tribes of the district will in any way recognize. 18. It is admitted that the Sultanate of Bir Ali is independent, and it may be admitted that the Sultanate of Habban is also tacitly recognized. But the most influential chief of the country and the only chief who really exercises control over the tribes is Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh, who may still be termed Sultan of Balahaf and its dependencies, but who really occupies at his head quarters of Azzan the position held in former days by the old Sultans of Hab ban, coupled with that of the leading representative of the family which enjoys the revenues of the port of Balahaf. 19. It is possible that he may in the future again reside himself at Habban, and I gather that negotiations are even now proceeding amongst the leading Sayids and inhabitants of that place to effect a settlement of certain blood feuds and other differences which still stand in the way. In the event of his return to Habban, I gather that Sultan Nasir bin Saleh will still be maintained, and that there will be very little real change in his position which is now that of a practical nonentity. 20. As to the feelings of the Sultans and Sheikhs on the subject of the best interests of the fort of Balahaf .—These are unquestionably in favour of maintaining tbe status quo ante and opposed to any alteration to the Kayti. The Sultan of Bir Ali some years ago parted with certain of his lands to the Kayti in the valley of Haifa. This has entailed fairly constant friction with some of the other tribes of the Wahidi country, whose rights were affected by that transfer, and w r ho from the experience thereby gained are evidently anxious to avoid further experiences of a similar nature. They are in principle opposed to any “ selling af the country ” and they are further obviously afraid of the result of any further interference in their affairs by a ruler who has already to their knowledge absorbed a good deal of territory which he did not originally possess. 21. As to the nature of the shares of Balahaf .—Up till about four or five years ago these simply consisted of customs dues of about a J dollar per package on ordinary goods and of about 2 lbs. per bag on grain. Practically no terri torial rights 'are included. Balahaf is a customs post pure and simple. There are however over and above the customs dues certain rights to wood and water from the little fishing village of Jala’a close by, there being no wells at Balahaf itself. And there are certain rights of salvage of any wrecks that may occur on the strip of shore in the vicinity and also to any ambergris that may be thrown up upon the beach. As far as I could ascertain no ambergris ever has been thrown up. The only other rights are to a share in the stipened and presents given by the British Government. 22. The Sultans all possess certain territorial rights in the interior of the country in the valley of Haifa and elsewhere, but they do not possess these as shareholders of Balahaf, the revenues of which are simply those abovemen- tioned. 23. About four or five years ago an addition was made to the revenues of Balahaf, which has slightly complicated affairs owing to a different distribution being effected to that of the other ordinary customs and also owing to the change effected in the relative positions of the shareholders. 24. It appears that some time after his expulsion from Habban, Sultan Mohsin established a right to the collection of certain transit dues at a place called A1 Hauta, a strong position on the road between Habban and the coast. Here he charged practically the same dues as those charged at both Balahaf and Habban, viz., a J dollar per package and about 2 lbs. per bag of grain. Collections went on at Balahaf and Habban as before, and Sultan Mohsin imposed his additional tax at A1 Hauta. In course of time the A1 Hauta Sheikh and various other tribes and parties concerned got tired of this arrangement and another w T as effected wiiereby the A1 Hauta collection w r as transferred to Bala haf where ihe dues were accordingly raised or rather doubled. During the past 40He thus parted with rights of which he was not sole possessor and gained a share in the dues of Balahaf which originally belonged to the other side of the family, with whose rights in the islands and the lands of Maifa he Lad unautho rized ly parted. 31. By this transaction he became possessed of a half share in the original dues of Balahaf, and it is this share with which he professes to have parted to the Kayti. But it appears from a document produced by Mohsin bin Saleh which bears the date June 1902, that Saleh bin Abdulla then made restitution to Mohsin and his brothers of the Jth share which he had previously acquired. He did this, it is allege!, upou his being pointed out to him that his transaction in regard to the islands and Maifa lands was so obviously wrong. Saleh bin Abdulla denies the authenticity of this document and his signature to it. But nevertheless it was quite possibly passed, and it may at least be granted that such restitution was perfectly equitable. This reduced Saleh’s share to his original Jth share in the customs dues of Balahaf including all the items previously mentioued as appertaining to them. 32. As to his share in the Habban dues, i.e., half of the existing dues now collected at Balahaf, the division of those was as above stated different. Of those Mohsin was allotted a fths share and the remaining fths was distributed amongst the other shareholders It may be held that Saleh owns a one-fifth of these. And his total share may be thus held to be approximately £ by £ + 5 - by i.e., a total of ^ths of the present dues, the balance being distributed much as follows :— ^oths to Mohsin and /oths to each of his two brothers. 33. This distribution is slightly complicated by a dispute as to the devolu tion of Ahmed bin Ali’s share upon his death which recently occurred. Mohsin contends that Ahmed left a will appointing him executor of this. But he has not produced the will, and Sultan Saleh disputes it and contends that Ahmed’s share naturally devolves upon him as the nearest of kin. 31. Another source of difference is that Sultan Mohsin now claims that the greater part of the money received from Government as stipend and pre sents should go to him instead of being distributed as before amongst the share holders in proportion to their shares in the Balahaf customs. In regard to this Mohsin has submitted a document, dated the 20th February 1900, which pur ports to be a compromise under which 70 dollars a year from this source was assigned to Sultan Saleh, the balance going to the other side of the family. Sultan Saleh denies the authenticity of this document also. But it may be admitted that Sultan Mohsin as the generally recognized tribal chief, has a claim to a larger portion of the stipend than the other shareholders in view of the more important and thus more expensive nature of his position. 35. But another dispute is also connected with this point and concerns the amount of the dues collected which should be assigned to the soldiers or “ Askari ” actually effecting the collection. Under previous arrangements it has been apparently customary for Jrd of the original customs dues and |th of the Habban dues go to the “ Askari,” the balance being distributed to the shareholders according to their shares. And gather that in former days it was the custom to also deduct expenses of entertainment, etc., from the dues collected before the distribution of shares was effected. 36. There is no doubt that the whole question of distribution of revenues has been somewhat complicated by Mohsin’s rise to power and the enhancement of the Balahaf dues which thereby originated. I have pressed the Sultans to come to an amicable arrangement in the matter, and it may be hoped that they will eventually do so. There seems to be no reason for us to settle these private disputes for them, and the proper mode of settlement would appear to be for them to eventually refer the matter to some of the leading Sayids of the district and accept their arbitration if their differences cannot othevvise be overcome. 4243 fay 37. For the purposes of this inquiry it is sufficient to state that as far as 1 can ascertain Sultan Saleh’s share with which he has endeavoured to part is really a 4 - 0 ths and not a one-half share in the total revenues of the port. 38. I gather that he has already received a part payment for this from the Kayti of 2.200 dollars. This will presumably lead to some sort of trouble if his transaction does not receive the sanction of Government. I gather that to meet that eventuality Saltan Saleh has pledged som of his lands in the interior to the Kayti, which it may possibly be impolitic to allow the Kayti to acquire. 39. To conclude it would perhaps be sound policy, if Mob sin is recognized as the titular Chief and Sultan Saleh’s transaction with the Kayti is negatived, to o-rant Mohsin such support in the way of increased stipend as may enable him to continue to maintain and to increase his influence and authonty over the wild and comparatively lawless Bedawin tribes who inhabit the 'Fahidi district. These tribes themselves levy dues known as “ Siyara on goods and kafilasthat traverse their territory, and I gather that feuds with each other and their neighbours are rife and to some of them almost essential to existence The old Sulemani Sheikh of the Dhuyaibi district is evidently fonder of fighting than of any other pursuit. 40 The Kayti might perhaps, if allowed, in time assert his authority over the tribes, but the process would, I think, be long and troublesome and it would have to be effected by means of the mercenaries who constitute the Kayti s only fighting strength and whose incursions would be resisted to the utmost by every true tribesman of the Wahidi. 41.

The Resident interviewed all the Sultans, Sayids and Sheikhs of the Wahidi now in Aden as per accompanying list, at the Residency this morning. He first saw the two Sultans of Balahaf—Sultan Mohsin hin Saleh and Sul tan Saleh bin Abdulla. He said that he hoped that they would soon come to an amicable settlement in the matter of the distribution of their shares in Balahaf. The Sultans said that they had not yet done so and that a final settlement would still probably take some time. The Resident advised them to settle the matter as soon as possible. Both Sultans admitted that there were at the present moment three Sultans of the Wahidi. They admitted the independence of the Sultan of Bir Ali, and they admitted that Sultan Nasir bin Saleh of Habban was at Habhan and in receipt of certain transit dues there. Sultan Mohsin asserted that this Sultan of Habban was there only with his will and consent, and that he was really a man of no consequence. The Sultan of Bir Ali was then invited to attend the interview, and he confirmed the above and alleged his own independence. The Resident then proceeded to another room where interviewed the rest of the Suit ins’ relatives, and the Sayids and Sheikhs of the tribes assem bled. They were unanimous in their support of Mohisin as the tribal Sultan of Balahaf audits dependencies, in which they included Azzan and practically Hab han, though they admitted the existence of Sultan Nasir hin Saleh at Habban. They admitted the independence of Bir Ali. They said that Mohsin was the only tribal Sultan whom they would recognise as their chief, and that they would not recognise Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla whom they regarded as not fit for such a position. They said that they would always abide loyally by their selection of Mohsin and fight for him. They said that they would willingly sign a document to this effect. They expressed themselves as strongly opposed to any alienation of territory to the Kayti, and said that they would resist such a measure to the utmost. The Resident then returned to the Sultans and had separate interviews with Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla and Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh. He reminded Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla of the fact that only a few years ago he had himself expressed his willingness to the election of Mohsin as titular Sultan. He pointed out to him that he had since then further provied himself incapable of exercising any real control in the Wahidi country. And he pointed out that his recent transac tion with the Kayti ipso focto proved his abandonment of claims to the Sultan ate. Sultan Saleh replied by insisting upon his own loyalty and friendship to the British Government remarking upon the fact that he remained loyal at the time when Mohsin was intriguing with the French and Turks and committing misdeeds on the shores of Balahaf. To this the reply was given that he was not the only signatory of the treaty of 1895 which other members of the family had also signed j Mbbsin alone being excluded on account of the misdemean ours of which he then proved himself guilty. Sultan 8aleh claimed that it was his personal influence over the other members of the family that brought about the treaty, to which it was replied that this was a doubtful factor, and that he had never in any way proved that he had any real influence at all either at Balahaf or elsewhere in the Wahidi country. He said that he had supporters and evidence that he could produce, to which the reply was given th it he had been given time and opportunity to produce them and that no further deny seemed under the circumstances justifiable. Einally the Resident advised Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla to come to an un derstanding with Mohsin and his other relations. 344PD 51i. ® e ^ oro the Sultan said that he was bond fide under the impression that he was acting in accordance with the wishes of the Residency in his transaction with the Kayti, owing to what the Kayti had told him, and to a con- versation which he had had with Colonel Abud in Aden in the time of the last Resident. To this the Resident replied that he should have made sure of the wishes of this Residency before he acted, and have asked their formal permission to any transaction he wished to undertake beforehand, instead of actin°’ first and expecting sanction to be accorded afterwards. Ihe Resident then had a short conversation with Sultan Mohsin. He pressed him too to come to an amicable understanding with Sultan Saleh in the matter of shares and other matters. Mohsin replied that he was willing to do so but that it was difficult, as Sultan Saleh was always Hying about all over the country, at one time to the Kayti and at another elsewhere, etc. He said that if Sultan Saleh would only live at Balahaf like the rest of the family instead of doing this, it would be possible to come to an understanding and arrange things satisfactorily. 6 Mohsin then talked about leaving and expressed anxiety to have as early a settlement as possible effected by his affairs. He was unwilling to go and leave his brother Hussen here. He was unwilling to stop here himself longer than was absolutely necessary. He was advised to be patient and informed that vernment would be asked to settle his affairs as soon as possible and that it was hoped that they would be settled in a few weeks at latest. Mohsin seemed disinclined to make any special written admission of the fact that ms nomination was only valid during the pleasure of the British Gov- ernment. He said that of course he would follow the wishes of Government and be loya! to them now m al! matters. But he did not evidently like the *7* 0f f s P e , oia ] st lP? lati A 0 ? which he kne ^ was not specially imposed in the case of other chiefs of the Aden protectorate. He was told that his case would now be reported to Government for orders and that meanwhile he would be best advised to be patient. The morning’s interview then ended—and the accompanying telegrams were sent to Government. i j o o (Sd.) F. de B. HANCOCK, QaytcLin t Acting First Resident, Aden.

The Resident interviewed the Sultans, Sayids and Sheikhs of the Wahidi tribes whose names are entered in attached list this morning and witnessed their signature on the attached document signifying their desire that Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh should be recognised as titular Sultan of the Wahidi and not Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla, and their consent to abide loyally by their selection if the same received the sanction of Government. He informed them that this document signifying their wishes would be forwarded to Government for orders. He then interviewed Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh and informed him that the whole case would now be referred to Government for orders and that meanwhile one of his brothers must remain in Aden pending the orders of Government. Sultan Mohsin was informed that he might send in his brother Ahmed to take Husain’s place whenever he liked. He was also informed that he might mean while himself remain here or return to his country pending the orders of Gov ernment whichever he liked. Sultan Mohsin then asked for a present and an advance of stipend. He was informed that something would be given to him to help him pay the ex pense of his journey, but that an advance of stipend could of course not be made pending the orders of Government in his case.

' 1,lqU,ry 0nly C0Ilflrmed * with exertion,’ K-a U i° ' Y fi S lnfor . m ® d th athe must now await the orders of Government and abide by them whatever they were. Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla then eTprefsed his irrevocable enmity towards Sultan Mohsin and his determination tn destroy himself rather than ever himself acknowledge Mohsin\ ,nn. * He illustrated this by drawing his Jambia and placing ^ against his throaT^'d then flinging it on the ground-an act of bad mLnenf whig wl re aRv pe d fectly inexcusable. He mentioned certain four names given in the ? , list as those of influential supporters of his cause. Ho w S as told that he h^af ready been given ample opportunity to bring forward his supporters, but that it was still open to him xf he choses to produce the four mentioned I wa, however, pointed out to him that the four whom he had produced at BaRbaf had none ot them expressed themselves iu bis favour or taken the trouble to come to Aden to support his cause. U01e t0Questioned as to the cause of his great enmity with Mohsin and as to the date of its inception, he stated that this was Mohsin’s intrigues with the French of 1894, and subsequent misdeeds of more recent date in connection with the loot of the huggalow Fateh-al-Salam.” He was informed that Government were aware of all this and that it would be duly taken into consideration, and decided upon in due course, and that meanwhile there was no necessity for him to remain any longer in Aden at present.

From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Hcn'ble Mr. 8. W. Ergerley, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I consider Sultan Mohsin of Balahaf undoubtedly by far the most influen tial among the Wahidi Sultans. He has been unanimously selected their titular Sultan by all the leading Sheikhs of the tribes, his only opponent being Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla himself, wbo refuses to recognise him. I now propose, in accordance with the last paragraph of Political Depart ment letter No. 1806, dated the 18th March 1905, to re-affirm the existing treaty of 1895, making Sultan Mohsin the only signatory and a few of the other Sultans and leading Sheikhs witnesses. Sultan Saleh will refuse to attest this treaty but his entire lack of support, coupled with his recent transaction with the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, renders his adherence to tbe treaty of no importance. Secondly, I propose taking a written undertaking from the Sultans and Sheikhs present to the effect that they will loyally abide by their selection. Lastly, I propose, if that is possible, to take a written admission from Sultan Mohsin that his nomination is only valid during the pleasure of Government. This, however, does not seem necessary if Mohsin signed the treaty. Please telegraph if you approve of this, as I wish to send as soon as possible all the Wahidis back to Balahaf at their earnest request. Also please telegraph if I may release Sultan Mohsin’s brother, who is at present detained as surety. I think this now advisable. All the Wahid’s strongly object to any alienation of territory to the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. Please let me know by telegraph if I may say that Sultan Saleh’s transaction with Mokalla will not be recognised. I would strongly recommend the adoption of this course.

Before any order #AboTe is promulgated to the Sheikhs or any further undertaking or document confirm ed by them, the matter will have to be referred to the Government of India, 65whose orders must be awaited. If the Sheikhs desire to give you a formal unanimous writing to the effect that they desire to formally remove Sultan Saleh and substitute Mohsin in his stead, you might receive that and promise to obtain Government orders thereon. They might then be sent back to Balakal pending the orders of Government. Sultan Mohsin’s brother must be detained pending orders of the Government of India. Please report fully by letter. //. No. 2388-E.B., dated Simla, the 21st June 1905. From— C. Somers Cocks, Esq., C.M.G., Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To—The Hon’ble Mr. S W. Edgerley, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department I am directed to refer to tbe correspondence on the subject of Balahaf affairs ending with your letter No. 34»7b* of June • Nom 3rd, 11*05. 2. Captain Hancock’s Memorandum demonstrates clearly that the time has come when the policy adopted in 1891 in regard to the treatment of Sultan Mohsin might be modified with advantage on the lines indicated in the letters from the Government of India of October 4th, 1902, and December 28th, 1903. 3. These lines appear to be followed in the recommendations now made by His Excellency the Governor in Council ; and I am to express the approval of the Government of India of the proposal that Sultan Mohsin should be recognized as titular Chief of the Wahidi tribe of Balahaf and that the stipend due to tbe titular Saltan should henceforth be paid to him instead of to Sultan Saleh. Steps should now be taken to conclude a treaty with Sultan Mohsin similar to that of 1895 with Sultan Saleh. The decision as to the number of signatories to which reference is made by the Political Resident in his telegram of May 16th, 1705, should be entirely governed by consideration of^ the policy which is likely to be most effective in strengthening Sultan Mohsin s authority over the Balahaf Wahidis. 4. It is observed that His Excellency in Council does not propose that the Resident should interfere ia the distribution of the Balahaf revenues, ihe Government of India concur in this policy as regards the other Wahidi Chiefs; but they consider that public notice should be taken of the action of Sultan Saleh in ceding territory to the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. To allow such^ a distinct violation of the treaty provisions of 1895 to pass without specific notice might act as an encouragement to other chiefs in the neighbourhood of Aden to disregard the provisions of their own treaties whenever it suited them to do so. Moreover it is advisable that the Kayti Sultan’s persistent attempts to aggrandize himself in the direction of Balahaf should be stopped, once for all, as his intrigues must needs produce unrest in the district. 6. I am therefore to suggest that, if His Excellency in Council sees no objec tion, the Resident should be instructed to issue a formal notification, for com- munication to Sultan Mohsin and Saleh, to the Kayti Sultan and to any ^ other chiefs who may be concerned, to the effect that Sultan Saleh s cession of territory to the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, having been made in violation of his treaty engagements without the previous sanction af the Resident, is null and void and will be so treated. It might he advisable to inform Sultan Saleh specifically that his irregular action is one of the reasons for his deposition. G. C. Ft-mI, Simla.—W®. 344 F.

With reference to paragraph 6 of tbe Resident’s letter I am to observe that, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, there is no reason at present to enhance Sultan Mohsin’s stipend, hut that, if Habban and Dir Ali should ultimately come under Ids influence, the circumstances might then warrant a revision of the amount now paid to him. 4. As regards the request for the presentation of a cannon, I am to say that the G &gt;vernor in Council supports Geueral Mason’s recommend itiou that a small smooth-bore gun should be presented to bultau Mohsiu for saluting pur poses at Balahaf. No. 7166, dated Aden Residency, tbe 24th November 1905. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, T 0 The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, in quadruplicate, for favour of ratification by H ; s Excellency tue Viceroy and Governor-General of India, the fresh Treaty concluded by Sultan Mohsiu-bin-Saleh of Balahaf in accordance with the instructions contained in Government of India, Foreign Department, J* 2 letter No. 2388-E. B.,* dated 21st June 1905. 2. Sultan Mohsin-bin-Saleh has been made the only signatory to the No.. 828 - 233 . Treaty and it has been fully impressed upon him that the sole responsibility for the conduct of the Wahidis of Balahaf and its dependencies will henceforth vest in him. I have impressed upon him that he will be expected to deal fairly with all the shareholders in the revenues of the small port and to manage its affairs to the general satisfaction of both ourselves and the country side. Sultan Mohsin has willingly accepted this responsibility. He under takes to be fair and just in all his dealings and he invites judgment according to his future actions. 3. As I have already reported he is by far the most influential Chief of the Wahidi tribe and alone exercises any real influence over their affairs. His three brothers, Ahmed, Hadi and Hussan, who witnessed the treaty are entirely subservient to him, and his cousin, Abdulla-bin-Husen though a n ‘ an 0 some influence, is subordinate to his control. 1 he late Sultan Sale i-bin- Abdulla is, as he always has been, a man of no personal influence and has lost the little he ever had by his recent endeavour to part with his share of Balahaf to the Kayti. 4. Sultan Mohsin has, as I anticipated, now definitely appealed for an enhanced stipend. He represents that his responsibility is great an ia ie now intends to properly discharge it. He points out that the coast districts need a firm control which he can only exercise by maintaining su cleu orCt s to quell disturbances. He urges that he has been now elected to a position of more importance than that pertaining to the bultan of Balaha a one, an a his expenses on account of entertainment and the general mamtenence 0 ns status as Sultan of all the people of Abdul Wahid will be enhanced accordingly. 8537 F D2 5. I hare previously reported that Sultan Mohsin has not yet reinstated himself at Habban, the old capital of the Wahidis, where Sultan Nasir-bin- Saleh still exercises a mild control, and I consider that until he really and finally re-establishes himself in that city, he cannot properly claim the full title of Sultan of all the Wahidi. Moreover, the Sultan of Bir Ali is also practically independent. At the same time Sultan Mohsin is the most power ful Chief of the tribe and, with his head-quarters at Azzan and his port at Balahaf, of considerably more importance and status than the Chiefs of either Bir Ali or Habban. Wdth Sultan Nasir-bin-Saleh of Habban we have at present no treaty relations. He has recently made overtures, and the result of these and of further inquiry, will show more fully the extent of the influence which he really exercises. 6. Meanwhile, however, I consider that it is important to, as far as possible, strengthen the hands of the Sultan whose election by a large majority of the 'Wahidi tribes, has been now recognised. Vis-a-vis the Kayti Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, it would seem particularly important, that he should be accorded support at the present juncture. And I have accordingly the honour to again recommend that the stipend granted to Sultan Mohsin should be enhanced. 7. Sultan Mohsin has asked to be presented with a small cannon. And, if some suitable weapon can be provided, I have the honour to recommend that a small smooth-bore gun should be presented to him for salutiug purposes at Balahaf. Such a gift would afford the recipient a pleasure out of all propor tion to its intrinsic value and would tend to enhance the importance of his position. 8. Before he goes, Sultan Mohsin is anxious to come to an understanding as to the mode and extent to which he shall henceforth exercise the rights of salvage which he in common with the other Maritime States of this Protec torate has always claimed and exercised. But this is a subject upon which I will in due course submit a separate report for the information of Government. CL L C. P.

I have the honour to report that the Arabic of the treaty in question is very faulty both in graminer and in idiom. It is therefore difficult to say exactly how it would be interpreted by an Arab ignorant of English. Article I is certainly capable of misconstruction. Mr. Azoo, the Arabic Instructor of the Board, (whose mother tongue is Arabic and whose acquaint ance with the grammer, syntax and literature of the language is exceptional ), misconstrued the meaning of this article till he referred to the English. 2. The following objections will, I think, be readily understood :— (1) In line 4 of the Arabic heading, the word “ peace ” has been rendered by am an Amdn means peace in the sense of “ security ” or “ safety ” and not peace in the sense of “peace existing between parties,” which is silm ^ (2) In Article I the phrase occurs “to extend to Balahaf the gracious favour and protection ” The Arabic of this phrase is quite inaccurate : the construction is not Arabic in the least. The clause mi^ht be twisted into the meaning that it was the territory of Balahaf that was to be extended. The word taitsi means “to extend” in the sense of “amplify, make broad boundaries of a province,” etc., (3) In line 4 of Article 2, for “successors” the word khulafa (&gt;ULL) is correctly used, hut as this word also signifies “ agents ” or “ lieutenants ” the words mmbad'hi are required to restrict it to the first significa tion. In line 5 of the Article, “entering into” is rendered by muddMialah This word, however, signifies “interference”, whereas dukhdl (j^Lo) (from the same root), signifies “entering into.” In line 6, mukdtabah (&amp;v^) is correctly used for “ agreement,” but if the word hilf (^L) were substituted, it would include any oral as well as any written agreement. In line 9, the plural is used instead of the singular : it is&gt; however, the Sultan who promises and not all the parties mentioned. 3 Attached is a translation made by Mr. Azoo. The Arabic may be trusted in every respect. It has been kept as close as possible to the original wording of the Arabic, and is so simple that any intelligent uneducated Arab could understand it: more — he could not misunderstand it.No. 2398, dated Bombay Castle, the 27th March 1906.

It is not necessary for His Excellency the Governor in Council to write at any length. The position of affairs has been very thoroughly cleared up by Captain Hancock’s thorough enquiry, and it is clear that the Sheikhs of the Wahidi tribe are unanimous in their resolution to depose Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla and to recognise Mohsin bin Salhe as their titular Sultan. It is clear also that, in the opinion of the Resident at Aden, Sultan Mohsin alone has in fluence to hold the tribe together, and that whatever influence Sultan Saleh previously had has been sacrificed by his negotiations with Sultan Ghalib of Shehr and Mokalla. That being so His Excellency the Governor in Council would recommend that accomplished facts be accepted and that Sultan Mohsin he recognised as titular Sultan of the Wahidi tribe of Balahaf and that the , D v - a , „ . v . K1 stipend* due to the titular Sultan should •Pro. No. 46 m Secret E., August 1893, Noa. 1*51. i 1 • , , , • „ be paid to him. It is not necessary for Government to consider at present how he will distribute the stipend to other sharers, nor what the shares in the revenue should be, nor how Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla will satisfy Sultan Ghalib of Shehr and Mokalla as regards the negotiation which he will now be unable to carry to conclusion.

In continuation of my letter No. 2241, dated the 16th April 1905, and with reference to your telegram, dated the 17th May 1905, regarding Balahaf affairs, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a memorandum submit ted to me by Captain F. de B.

S. “ Elphinstone ” and make local enquiries on the points which Government in their letter No. 1306, dated the 18th March 1905, required to be further elucidated. 2. Captain Hancock has taken considerable pains to go minutely into the whole question and the result of his enquiries has been to confirm my own views that Mohsin bin Saleh is the only man capable of being the Sultan of the Wahidi of Balahaf. At the two interviews I have had with the principal Sheikhs and Sayids of the tribe on the 15th and 19th instant, notes of which are herein enclosed, they have been unanimous in their support of Mohsin as 1 4S1FD2 tii6 titular 1 Secret E., August 1895, Nos. 1-51, ouitan ana at the second of the interviews have signed a document, herewith forw arded, signifying, their desire n i -i • * that Saleh bin Abdulla* should hp for. nwlly deposed m favour of Mobsin bin Saleh whom they select for the chiefship and expressing their consent to abide loyally by their selection if the same receives the sanction of Government.

Even were it otherwise, that no alienation of territory was involved and Sultan Saleh simply parted with his share in he customs dues of Balal af, I would still not recommend the confirmation of the transaction. For, as I have already said in one of my earlier letters, it is sure to give rise to constant friction between the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalia and the co-sharers of Balahaf, as well as all the tribesmen of the Wahidi country 5. In regard to the present distribution of the shares in the port of Balahaf Captain Hancock has gone into the matter at length, lint I amenable to form to becorMn “‘T’' ^ ?‘ e aCtual sllare of Saleh bin Abdulla as there see? to be certain factors which have given rise to complication. This point how- evor, seems to bo immaterial to the settlement of the unstisfaotory state of affairs which has hitherto existed in Balahaf, and I a'-ree with Canta’n linn cock m thinking that there is no reason for’us to settle t?s private disput; regarding the shares and that the proper mode of settlement would be forUie Sultans to refer the matter to the arbitration of some of their leading Sayids. +1 } . GI l clos . e als T 0 ’ for the information of Government, notes of interview of May fi 1905 DterVieW 1 ^ Wlth Sultan Saleh biu Abdulla on the 20 th3 memorandum. Balahaf Affairs. In accordance with instructions, I left i\den on the morning of the 7th instant by the R. I. M. S. “ Elphinstone ” and arrived at Balahaf shortly before noon on the following day. 2 . In the early afternoon, I interviewed the leading Mansab of Habban and his cousin, viz., Sayid Salim bin Ahmed bin Ali bin Umar al Mehdthar and Sayid Kasim bin Ali bin Huss iin bin Ali bin Umar al Mehdthar. This particular family of Mausabs has frequently been referred to in previous records of the Residency since 1887, and is one of the leading families of Sayids who, as reported in Major Hunter’s account of the Arab tribes in the vicinity of Aden, exert great influence amongst the Wahidi tribes. Habban was in former days the recognized capital of the Wahidi country and the seat of Government and is still the largest and most important town in the district. S. A little later, I interviewed two of the actual collectors of the customs of the port, named Saleh bin Saeed bin Jarba and Hussein bin Abdulla bin Husein bin Saleh, the latter of whom is a distant relation of the family of Sultans. And after Ihad discussed the affairs of the port for some little time with them, I interviewed all the Sultans of Balahaf (except Husein, who was left in Aden) and the Sultan of Bir Ali. Those present at this interview were— Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla of Balahaf. Sultan Hadi bin Saleh of Balahaf. Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh of Balahaf. Sultan Ahmed bin Saleh of Balahaf. Sultan Saleh bin Ahmed of Bir Ali. Abdulla bin Hussein, a cousin of the Sultans of Balahaf. Sayid Omar bin Salim bin Aidaroos, a companion and supporter of Sultan Mohsin, 4. The interview lasted for some time and was rather difficult as it was constantly interrupted by mutual recriminations between the Sultans. Sultan Hadi bin Saleh vas evidently non compos mentis and Sultan Mohsin and Sultan Saleh of Balahaf were both at times violent and troublesome. 5. On the following morning I landed at Balahaf in company with Lieutenant Hamilton of the R. I. M. S. “Elphinstone” and Lieutenant Hart of the Royal Garrison Artillery. I took an escort of six sepoys of the 94th Russell’s Infantry under their Jemadar Sayid Jacoob who mounted an independent guard over the fort which Sultan Mohsin has lately repaired and where I held all the morning’s interviews. The escort behaved through out the morning with excellent steadiness, and great credit is due to them and also to the officers and crew of the R. I. M. S. “ Elphinstone” for the entire absence of friction that attended all the proceedings. 6 . All the Sultans and tribesmen were drawn up in a long row along the shore to receive me. Upon landing I shook hands and exchanged a few words with some of them and then proceeded into the fort, where I proceeded to again interview the Sultans and Sayids and all the leading Sheikhs of the various tribes who bad assembled at Balahaf for the occasion. The following is the list of the Sheikhs whom I interviewed, and from inquiries made on the spot I ascertained that the majority of the tribes were fully and properly represented :— (1) Sheikh Saeed bin Nasir Al Jasari, the Sad al Habban. The most important Sheikh in the district of Habban. He has about 400 followers or more and lives near Habban. (2) Sheikh Said bin Salim Suedan of the Sad al Sha’ ab, an important leader of the tribe of Sad al Sha’ab. He has over a hundred followers and lives north of Amakin in the Habban district.Sheikh Mansoor bin Nashir A1 Habtoor. He has about 100 followers and lives not far from Libya in the Azzan district at what was known as the Ghel A1 Saidi. (4) Sheikh Nasir bin Mohs'n of the Ahl Omar bin Ali, who lives near A1 Rawdthar and has about 50 followers. (5) Sheikh Muhammad bin Awadth of the tribe of Ba Dayan, who lives south of Hauta in the Habban district and has a following of about 200 men. (6) Sheikh Awadth bin Hadi A1 Sulemani, leader of the tribes of the Hamyar, who lives in the hills near the coast in the Dhuyaibi district and has an immediate personal following of about 300 men and great influence over all the coast tribes between Irka and Balahaf. (7) Sheikh Mansa bin Salem of the tribe of A1 Abdali, who has a following of about 150 men and lives at Ain Ba Mabad. (8) Salem bin Abdulla bin Lasal of the tribe Ba Auda, who has a following of about 200 men and lives between Azzam and the coast. In regard to this Sheikh it was admitted that his cousin Ali bin Awadth was the most influential leader of the tribe, but it was said that he had sent his cousin to represent him vide Arabic Department 117 of 16th May 1903. (9) Nasir bin Salim bin Laswad of the Komashi tribe who has a following of about 680 and lives south of Habban. (10) Awadth bin Muhammad of the Ba Kutmi who numbers over 100 men and lives near llawil Bil Arab. (11) Ahmed bin Ali bin Tawil of the Said A1 Sha’ab who numbers about 20fl follower and lives near Arnakin, (12) Salim bin Saeed A1 Suweder of the Ahl Hayasam who also lives near Amakin and numbers about 150 men. (13) Hasan bin Naser of the Ahl Fahide who lives in Amakin and is the leader of 3 50 soldiers. (It) Saeed bin Salem bin Rashid who lives at Raida and has 100 followers. (15) Abdulla bin Saeed bin Baneit who has 100 followers up in the north of the Maifah Wadi. (16) Mehdi bin Abdulla Ba Kutmi who lives at Jirdan and had 120 followers. (17) Ahmed bin Omar A1 Admi who lives north-east of Hura and has a few hundred followers. 7. All except the last four of the Sheikhs were strong supporters of Mohsin bin Saleh as Sultan of the Wahidis and the last four, who said that they had come at Sultan Saleh’s special request, did not express themselves in favour of Sultan Saleh, but said that they really did not miud who was elected and would not consider themselves subject to any one. Some of the ether Sheikhs similarly claimed actual independence, hut nevertheless supported Sultan Mobsin’s election. All the Sultans and Sheikhs were strongly opposed to the idea of any alteration of any part of Balahaf to the Kayti. One of them, Ahmed bin Umar of the Ali Admi tribe, offered to name any Sultan I chose for money. 8 . After these interviews I returned on board the E. I. M. S. “ Elphin- stone ” and was followed in the afternoon by the Sultans, Sayids, and some of the leading Sheikhs whom I asked to accompany me to Aden to see the Eesident. We sailed from Balahaf at 5 p.m. on the 9th instant and arrived at Aden about 5 p. m. on the afternoon of the 10th. I had further inter views with some of the Sultans and Sheikhs on the way into Aden, and have 4since arrival had further conversations with several of them connected with the subject of my inquiry and the examination of the documentary evidence produced. The names of the party who accompanied me to Aden are as follows : 1 . Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh, 2 . Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla, 3 . Sultan Abdulla bin Husein, 4 .

Saleh bin Abdulla. Sultan Saleh the tribes and has forfeited anyth transaction with the Kaytn 1 c election of Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh 511. Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh, on the other hand, has considerable personal influence oyer the tribes and, as far as I have been able to ascertain, alone has power to exercise any real control over them. This influence he has established in the course of the past ten years by natural force of character and strength of action. 12. It was in 1SS5 that Sultan Uadi binNasirof Balahaf, his elder brother was elected to occupy the position of titular Sultan of the Wahidi. He, it is to be noted, was the third of the Sultans of Balahaf to occupy this dual posi tion, his predecessors being Nasir, bin Abdulla , the first Sultan of Balahaf, and Ahmad bin Nasir his son. They, it will be remembered, were first granted sole enjoyment of the revenues of Balahaf for themselves and their successors by Sultan Abdulla, the eighth Sultan of the Wahidi, upon their fortifying the post. 13. And it was very shortly after 1885 that, after a troubled and precarious rule for a brief period only, Sultan Hadi proved himself incompetent to fill the position to which he had been elected and was entirely ousted by his younger and more enterprising brother, Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh. 14. During the next few years various troubles arose between Sultan Mohsin and the tribes and inhabitants of the old capital of Habban. These were mainly due to disputes concerning the property tax “ Ashur ” to a share in which Sultan Mohsin laid a claim which was resisted by the inhabitants; a certain influential merchant of Uabban of the family of Alaiwas being one of his most vigorous opponents. And it was in consequence of these troubles that Mohsin first made an ineffectual appeal to the Aden Residency, and then had resort to the Upper Aulaki tribe, with whose assistance he reinstated himself at Habban, but with wdiom he afterwards himself quarrelled owing to their attempt to, in their turn, secure a share in the very property tax which was at the bottom of all the troubles. ' - 15. The eventual outcome of those disturbances was that Sultan Mohsin was compelled to vacate the old capital of Habban, and to reside instead at the neighbouring town of Azzan which he has ever since made his head-quarters. A descendant of another branch of the ruling family named Nasir bin Saleh was invited to occupy the old seat of Government at Habban and to this day occupies the position of Sultan of that town, and receives a share not of the old property tax but of the customs dues. This Sultan Nasir, however, is now evidently a nominal Sultan only. He is generally admitted to be a practical nonentity and to only occupy his present position at Habban on sufferance. 16. Sultan Mohsin’s fresh application for assistance to the Aden Residency which was refused in 1894, and the refusal of which led to his intrigues with the French and Turks and culminated in the conclusion of the treaty of 1895, in which Mohsin was not included as a signatory are comparatively modern history. In 1901, it wall be remembered, that the Sultans of Balahaf, including Sultan Saleh tin Abdulla, and various other Sheikhs of the Wahidi wished Sultan Mohsin to be recognised as titular Sultan and that their request was negatived in Government Resolution, Political Department, No. 2845, dated 16th April 1902. Recent events connected with the loot of the buggalow •‘Fateh al-Salam” I need not here recapitulate. 17. The main fact is that Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh has throughout all vicissitudes maintained a position of supremacy in Balahaf affairs and of com parative supremacy throughout the Wahidi country which he still occupies, and that he is really the only nominee for the tribal sultanate whom the Bedawin tribes of the district will in any way recognize. 18. It is admitted that the Sultanate of Bir Ali is independent, and it may be admitted that the Sultanate of Habban is also tacitly recognized. But the most influential chief of the country and the only chief who really exercises control over the tribes is Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh, who may still be termed Sultan of Balahaf and its dependencies, but who really occupies at his head quarters of Azzan the position held in former days by the old Sultans of Hab ban, coupled with that of the leading representative of the family which enjoys the revenues of the port of Balahaf. 610 . It is possible that be may in the future again reside himself at Habban, and I gather that negotiations are even now proceeding amongst the leading Say ids and inhabitants of that place to effect a settlement of certain blood feuds and other differences which still stand in the way. In the event of his return to Habban, I gather that Sultan Nasir bin Saleh will still be maintained, and that there will be very little real change in his position which is now that of a practical nonentity. £0. As to the feelings of the Sultans and Sheikhs on the subject of the lest interests of the port of Balahaf —These are unquestionably in favour of maintaining the status quo ante and opposed to any alteration to the Kayti. The Sultan of Bir Ali some years ago parted with certain of his lands to the Kayti in the valley of Maifa. This has entailed fairly constant friction with some of the other tribes of the Wahidi country, whose rights were affected by that transfer, and who from the experience thereby gained are evidently anxious to avoid further experiences of a similar nature. They are in principle opposed to any “ selling of the country *’ and they are further obviously afraid of the result of any further interference in their affairs by a ruler who has already to their knowledge absorbed a good deal of territory which he did not originally possess. 21. As to the nature of the shares of Balahaf —Up till about four or five years ago these simply consisted of customs dues of about a J dollar per package on ordinary goods and of about 2 lbs. per bag on grain. Practically no terri torial rights are included. Balahaf is a customs post pure and simple. There are however over and above the customs dues certain rights to wood and water from the little fishing village of Jala’a close by, there being no wells at Balahaf itself. And there are certain rights of salvage of any wrecks that may occur on the strip of shore in the vicinity and also to any ambergris that may be thrown up upon the beach. As far as I could ascertain no ambergris ever has been thrown up. The only other rights are to a share in the stipend and pre sents given by the British Government. 22. The Sultans all possess certain territorial rights in the interior of the country in the valley of Maifa and elsewdiere, but they do not possess these as shareholders of Balahaf, the revenues of which are simply those abovemen- tioned. 23. About four or five years ago an addition was made to the revenues of Balahaf, which has slightly complicated affairs owing to a different distribution being effected to that of the other ordinary customs and also owing to the change effected in the relative positions of the shareholders. 24. It appears that some time after his expulsion from Habban, Sultan Mohsin established a right to the collection of certain transit dues at a place called A1 Hauta, a strong position on the road between Babban and the coast. Here he charged practically the same dues as those charged at both Balahaf and Habban, viz.y a J dollar per package and about 2 lbs. per bag of grain. Collections went on at Balahaf and Habban as before, and Sultan Mohsin imposed his additional tax at Al Hauta. In course of time the A1 Hauta Sheikh and various other tribes and parties concerned got tired of this arrangement and another was effected whereby the Al Hauta collection was transferred to Bala haf where the dues were accordingly raised or rather doubled.^ During the past five years therefore the dues of Balahaf have actually consisted of a combina tion of the original customs dues of the port and of Sultan Mohsin’s transit dues. And that is what they still consist of. 25. To all intents and purposes, however, the dues may still be termed the customs dues of Balahaf and any future reduction may, anyhow for some time to come, be considered improbable. It may be that some day in the future a reduction to the old rates will be insisted upon, but it seems more probable that the enhancement effected and now enforced will henceforth indefinitely continue. 26. Merchants and traders would doubtless welcome a reduction. They now pay fths of a dollar between the port of Balahaf and Habban, whereas 7ABDULLA. Nasir. Talib. Saleh. AU. Ahmed. Abdulla. Nasir. Saleh . Ahmed. Bubakr. Hadi. Nasir. Hasan. Ahmed. Mohsin. Hnsein . 28. Those italicised are the sole surviving members of the family. Hadi bin Saleh is, as above stated, non compos mentis and need not be considered a shareholder. He is maintained by his brothers. 19. The family may be divided into two brances—the descendant of Saleh bin Nasir and those of Ahmed bin Nasir. Talib and Ali bin Nasir were Saleh’s blood brothers and upon their death without heirs their shares in the property devolved upon Saleh bin Nasir. Saleh bin Nasir’s family thus became possessed of a fths share to Ahmed bin Nasir’s Jth share. 30. From inquiries made there is no doubt that a good many years a»o, while Mohsin was still a comparative youth, Saleh bin Abdulla gained posses sions of a J- share of the shares of the other side of the family. This was effected by two transactions—-(a) the purchase of a ^th share fro n Ahmed and Moh sin and (6) the acquisition of a ^ths share from Hadi bin Saleh. The first transaction calls for no special remarks, but the second does. It appears that Hadi bin Saleh sold his share in the property (a ^th) to the Sultan of Bir Ali some years ago for a very inadequate pecuniary consideration, and that there after Saleh bin Abdulla acquired them back from the Sultan of Bir Ali for a very excessive consideration. He gave up his family’s claims to certain shares in some lands in the valley of Maifa and in certain three islands off the coast named A1 Barraka, A1 Salka, and A1 Kaide which are valuable on account of the guano collected on them which is used mainly for the manuring of tobacco; and he thereby regained/ur himself Hadi’s r ^.th share in the dues of Balahaf.’ He thus parted with rights of which he was not sole possessor and gained a share in the dues of Balahaf which originally belonged to the other side of the family, with whose rights in the islands and the lands of Maifa he bad unautho- rizedly parted. 31. By this transaction he became possessed of a half share in the original dues of Balahaf, and it is this share with which he professes to have parted to the Kayti. But it appears from a document produced by Mohsin bin Saleh which bears the date June 1902, that Saleh bin Abdulla then made restitution to Mohsin and his brothers of the Jth share which he had previously acquired He did this, it is alleged, upon his being pointed out to him that his transaction in regard to the islands and Maifa lands was so obviously wrong. Saleh binAbdulla denies the authenticity of this document and his signature to it. But nevertheless it was quite possibly passed, and it may at least be granted that such restitution was perfectly equitable. This reduced Saleh’s share to his original Jth share in the customs dues of Balahaf including all the items pre viously mentioned as appertaining to them. 32. As to his share in the Habhan dues, i.e., half of the existing dues now collected at Balahaf, the division of those was as above stated different. Of those Mohsin was allotted a fths share and the remaining fths was distributed amongst the other shareholders. It may be held that Saleh pwns a one-fifth of these. And his total share may be thus held to be approximately i by J -f J by i, i.e., a total of 4 a 0 ths of the present dues, the balance being distributed much as follows :— ifths to Mohsin and 4 a 0 ths to each of his two brothers. 33 . This distribution is slightly complicated by a dispute as to the devolu tion of Ahmed bin Ali’s share upon his death which recently occurred. Mohsm contends that Ahmed left a will appointing him executor of this. But he has not produced the will, and Sultan Saleh disputes it and contends that Ahmed’s share naturally devolves upon him as the nearest of kin. 34. Another source of difference is that Sultan Mohsin now claims that the greater part of the money received from Government as stipend and pre sents 0 should go to him instead of being distributed as before amongst the share holders in proportion to their shares in the Balahaf customs. In regard to this Mohsin has submitted a document, dated the 2' th February 1900,^ which pur ports to be a compromise under which 70 dollars a year from this source was assigned to Sultan Saleh, the balance going to the other side of the family. Sultan Saleh denies the authenticity of this document also. But it may be admitted that Sultan Mohsin as the generally recognized tribal chief, has a claim to a larger portion of the stipend than the other shareholders in view of the more important and thus more expensive nature of his position. 35 But another dispute is also connected with this point and concerns the amount of the dues collected which should be assigned to the soldiers or ‘'Askari”actually effecting the collection. Under previous arrangements it has been apparently customary for £rd of the original customs dues and yth ot theHabban dues go to the “Askari,” the balance being distributed to the shareholders according to their shares. And I gather that m former days it was the custom to also deduct expenses of entertainment, etc., from the dues collected before the distribution of shares was effected. 36. There is no doubt that the whole question of distribution of revenues has been somewhat complicated by Mohsin’s rise to power and the enhancement of the Balahaf dues which thereby originated. I have pressed the S « ltan s to come to an amicable arrangement in the matter, and it may be hoped that they will eventually do so. There seems to be no reason for us to settle these private disputes for them, and the proper mode of settlement would appear to be for them to eventually refer the matter to some of the leading Sayids of the district and accept their arbitration if their differences cannot otherwise be oveicome. 37 For the purposes of this inquiry it is sufficient to state that as far as I can ascertain Sultan Saleh’s share with which he has endeavoured to part is really a 4 s 0 ths and not a one half share m the total revenues of the poit. 38 I gather that he has already received a part payment for this from the Kayti of 2,200 dollars. This will presumably lead to some sort of trouble if his transaction does not receive the sanction of Governmen . ^ inferior meet that eventuality Sultan Saleh has pledged some of his lands in the interior to the Kayti, which it may possibly be impolitic to allow the Kayti to acquire. 39. To conclude it would perhaps be sound policy, if Mobsm is recognized as the titular Chief and Sultan Saleh’s transaction with the Kayti is negatived, to grant Mohsin such support in the way of increased stipend as may enable 9 481DFhim to continue to maintain and to increase bis influence and authority over $ the wild and comparatively lawless Bedawin tribes who inhabit the Wahidi district. These tribes themselves levy dues known as “ Siyara ” on goods and kafilas that traverse their territory, and I gather that feuds with each other and their neighbours are rife and to some of them almost essential to existence. The old Sulemani Sheikh of the Dhuyaibi district is evidently fonder of fighting than of any other pursuit. 40, The Kayti might perhaps, if allowed, in time assert his authority over A the tribes but the process would, I think, be long and troublesome and it would have to be effected by means of the mercenaries who constitute the Kayti’s only fighting strength and whose incursions would be resisted to the utmost by every true tribesman of the Wahidi. 41. A map, a list of villages and tribes and a genealogical tree amended from local sources of information, accompany this memorandum. For this and much other valuable assistance I am much indebted to this office interpreter, Mr. Abdul Bub, who accompanied me to Balahaf and rendered excellent service. (Sd.) F. de B.

The Resident iinterviewed all the Sultans, Suyids and Sheikhs of the Wahidi now in Aden as per accompanying list, at the Residency this morning. He first saw the two Sultans of Balahaf—Sultan Mohsinhin Saleh and Sul tan Saleh bin Abdulla. He said that he hoped that they would soon come to an amicable settlement in the matter of the distribution of their shares in Balahaf. The Sultans said that they had not yet done so and that a final settlement would still probably take some time. The Resident advised them to settle the matter as soon as possible. Both Sultans admitted that there were at the present moment three Sultans of the Wahidi. They admitted the independence of the Sultan of Bir Ali, and they admitted that Sultan Nasir bin Saleh of Habban was at Habban and in receipt of certain transit dues there. Sultan Mohsin asserted that this Sultan of Habhan was there only with his wull and consent, and that he was really a man of no consequence. The Sultan of Bir Ali was then invited to attend the interview, and he confirmed the above and alleged his owm independence. The Resident then proceeded to another room where he interviewed the rest of the Sultans’ relatives, and the Sayids and Sheikhs of the tribes assem bled. They were unanimous in their support of Mohsin as the ttihal Sultan of Balahaf and its dependencies, in which they included Azzan and practically Hab ban, though they admitted the existence of Sultan Nasir bin Saleh at Habban. They admitted the independence of Bir Ali. They said that Mohsin was the only tribal Sultan whom they would recognise as their chief, and that they would net recognise Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla whom they regarded as not fit for such a position. They said that they w T ould always abide loyally by their selection of Mohsin and fight for him. They said that they would willingly sign a document to this effect. They expressed themselves as strongly opposed to any alienation of territoiy to the Kayti, and said that they would resist such a measure to the utmost. The Eesident then returned to the Sultans and had separate interviews with Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla and Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh. He reminded Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla of the fact thatonly a few years ago he had himself expressed his willinoness to the election of Mohsin as titular Sultan. He pointed out to him that he had since then further proved himself incapable of exercising any real control in the Wahidi country. And he pointed out that Ins recent transaction with the Kayti ipso facto proved his abandonment of claims to the Sultanate. Sultan Saleh replied by insisting upon his own loyalty and friendship to the British Government remarking upon the fact that he remained loyal at the time when Mohsin was intriguing with the French and lurks and committing misdeeds on the shores of Balahaf. To this the reply was given that he was not the only signatory of the treaty of 1895 winch other members of the family had also signed ; Mohsin alone being excluded on account of the ^demean ours of which he then proved himself guilty. Sudan Saleh claimed that it w,. his personal influence over the other members ot the ^ br&lt; the treaty, to which it was replied that this was a f ouh * fnl r ‘7’ ' nd • had never in any wav proved that he had ary real influence at all either at Balahaf or elsewhere J the Wahidi com dry He said that m had supporters and evidence that he could produce, to which the reply was given that he had been given time and opportunity to produce them ai.d that no fuither delay seemed under the circumstances justifiable. Finally the Resident advised Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla to come to an un derstanding with Mohsin and his other relations. 17 481EDBefore leaving the Sultan said that he was bora fide under the impression that he was acting in accordance with the wishes of the Besidency in his transaction with the Ivayti, owing to what the Ivaj ti had told him, and to a con versation which he had had w r ith Colonel Abud in Aden in the time of the last Resident. To this the Resident replied that he should have made sure of the wishes of this Residency before he acted, and nave asked then formal pci mission to any transaction he wished to undertake beforehand, instead of acting first and expecting sanction to be accorded afterwards. The Resident then had a short conversation with Sultan Mohsin. He pressed him too to come to an amicable understanding with Sultan Saleh in the matter of shares and other matters. Mohsin replied that he was willing to do so but that it w T as difficult, as Sultan Saleh was always flying about all over the country, at one time to the Kayti and at another elsewhere, etc. lie said that if Sultan Saleh would only live at Balahaf like the rest of the family in stead of doing this, it would be possible to eome toau understanding and arrange things satisfactorily. Mobsin then talked about leaving and expressed anxiety to have as early a settlement as possible effected by bis affairs. He was unwilling to go and leave his brother Hussen here. He was unwilling to stop here himself longer than was absolutely necessary. He was advised to be patient and informed that Government would be asked to settle his affairs as soon as possible and that it was hoped that they would be settled in a few weeks at latest. Mohsin seemed disinclined to make any special written admission of the fact that his nomination was only valid during the pleasure of the British Gov ernment. He said that of course he would follow the wishes of Government and be loyal to them now in all matters. But he did not evidently like the idea of this special stipulation which he knew was not specially imposed in the case of other chiefs of the Aden protectorate. He was told that his case would now be reported to Government for orders,, and that meanwhile be would be best advised to be patient. The morning’s interview then ended—and the accompanying telegrams were sent to Government. (Sd.) F. de B. HANCOCK, Captain, 15th May 1905. Acting First Resident, Aden.

The Resident interviewed the Sultans, Sayids 'and Sheikhs of the Wahidi tribes whose names are entered in attached list this morning and witnessed their signature on the attached document signifying their desire that Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh should be recognised as titular Sultan of the Wahidi and not Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla, and their consent to abide loyally by their selection if the same received the sanction of Government. He informed them that this document signifying their wishes would be forwarded to Government for orders. He then interviewed Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh and informed him that the whole case would now be referred to Government for orders and that meanwhile one of his brothers must remain in Aden pending the orders of Government. Sultan Mohsin was informed that he might send in his brother Ahmed to take Husain’s place whenever he liked- He was also informed that he might mean while himself remain here or return to his country pending the orders of Gov ernment whichever he liked. Sultan Mohsin then asked for a present and an advance of stipend. He was informed that something would be given to him to help him pay the ex penses of his journey, but that an advance of stipend could of course not be made pending the orders of Government in his case. The interview then closed. (Sd). F. de B. HANCOCK, Oaptain^ 19th May 1905. Acting First Assistant Resident.

MASON, Major-General, Resident, Aden, The Resident interviewed Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla of Balahnf this morn ing. He informed him that a full report of his affairs was now being sent to Government and that he would be informed of the result in due course. Upon Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla urging that some of the Sultans and Sheikhs of the Wahidis were in favour of his election as Sultan, he was informed that none of those seen by the First Assistant Resident at Balahaf or present now in Aden had expressed such an opinion, and he was also reminded of the fact that in 1901 a pronouncement in favour of the election of Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh had been made by certain leaders of the Wahidi tribes and also by him, himself, which recent further inquiry had only confirmed, with the excep tion, of course, of himself. He was informed that he must now await the orders of Government and abide by them whatever they were. Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla then expressed his irrevocable enmity towards Sultan Mohsin and his determination to destroy himself rather than ever himself acknowledge Mohsin’s supremacy. He illustrated this by drawing his Jambia and placing it against his throat and then flinging it on the ground—an act of bad manners which was really perfectly inexcusable. He mentioned certain four names given in the attached list as those of influential supporters of his cause. He was told that he had already been given ample opportunity to bring forward his supporters, but that it was still open to him if he choses to produce the four mentioned. It was, however, pointed out to him that the four whom he had produced at Balahaf had none of them expressed themselves in his favour or taken the trouble to come to Aden to support his cause.Questioned as to the cause of his great enmity w ith Mohsin and as to the date of its inception, he stated that this was Mohsin’s intrigues with the French of 1894, and subsequent misdeeds of more recent date in connection with the loot of the buggalow “ Fateh-al-Salam. ” He was informed that Government were aware of all this and that it would be duly taken into consideration, and decided upon in due course, and that meanwhile there was no necessity for him to remain any longer in Aden at present. The interview then closed. -Aden ; (Sd.) F. B deBANCOCK, Captain, 20lh May 1905. ) Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden. Sheikh Mohammed bin Saeed bin Aliff, residing in Upper Haura.

From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Hon’ble Mr. S. W. Edgerley, CUE., Chief Secretary to the Govern ment of Bombay, Political Department. I consider Sultan Mobsin of Balahaf undoubtedly by far the mo-t influen tial among the Wahidi Sultans.* He has been unanimously selected their titular Sultan by all the leading Sheikhs of the tribes, his only opponent being Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla himself, who refuses to recognise him. I now propose, in accordance with the last paragraph of Political Depart ment letter No. 1806, dated the 18th March 1905, to re-affirm the existing treaty of 1895, making Sultan Mohsin the only signatory and a few of the other Sultans and leading Sheikhs witnesses. Saltan Saleh will refuse to attest this treaty, but his entire lack of support, coupled with his recent transaction, with the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, renders his adherence to the treaty of no importance. Secondly, I propose taking a written undertaking from the Sultans and Sheikhs present to the effect that they will loyally abide by their selection. Lastly, I propose, if that is possible, to take a written admission from Sultan Mohsin that his nomination is only valid during the pleasure of Government. This, however, does not seem necessary if Mohsin signed the treaty. Please telegraph if you approve of this, as I wish to send as soon as possible all the Wahidis back to Balahaf at their earnest request. Also please telegraph if I may release Sultan Mohsin’s brother, who is at present detained as surety. I think this now advisable. All the Wahidis strongly object to any alienation of territory to the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. Please let me know by telegraph if I may say that Sultan Saleh’s transaction with Mokalla will not be recognised. I would strongly recommend the adoption of this course. Telegram, dated the 17th May 1905. From—The Hon’ble Mr. S. W. Edgerley, CUE., Chief Secretary to the Govern ment of Bombay, Political Department, To— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden. With reference to your telegram of the 15th May 1905. Before an/ order is promulgated to the Sheikhs or any further undertaking or document confirmed by them, the matter will have to be referred to the Government of 21 481FDr India, whose orders must be awaited. If the Sheikhs desire to give you a formal unanimous writing to the effect that they desire to formally remove Sultan Saleh and substitute Mohsin in his stead, you might reeeive that and promise to obtain Government orders thereon. They might then be sent hack to Balahaf pending the orders of Government. Sultan Mohsin’s brother must be detained pending orders of the Government of India. Please report fully by letter.

I am directed to refer to the correspondence on the subject of Balahaf affairs ending with your letter No. 3476 of June 3rd, 1905. 2. Captain Hancock’s Memorandum demonstrates clearly that the time has come when the policy adopted in • Secret E., August is94, Nos. 98-107. 1894* in regard to the treatment of Sultan Mohsin might be modified with advantage on the lines indicated in the letters t Pro.

These lines appear to be followed in the recommendations now made by His Excellency the Governor in Council; and I am to express the approval of the Government of India of the proposal that Sultan Mohsin should be recognized as titular Chief of the Wahidi tribe of Balahaf and that the stipend due to the titular Sultan should henceforth be paid to him instead of to Sultan Saleh. Seeps should now be taken to conclude a treaty with Sultan Mohsin Pro. No. 47 iu Secret E , August 1895, Nos. 1 similar to that of 1895§ with Sultan Saleh. '' 61 - The decision as to the number of signa tories to which reference is made by the Political Resident in his telegram of May 15th, 1905, should be entirely governed by consideration of the policy which is likely to be most effective in strengthening Sultan Mohsin’s authority over the Balahaf Wahidis. 4 . It is observed that His Excellency in Council does not propose that the Resident should interfere in the distribution of the Balahaf revenues. The Government of India concur in this policy as regards the other Wahidi Chiefs; Saleh in ceding territory to the Sultan of Sliehr and Mokalla. To allow such a Pro No. 47, Secret e., August 1895, Nos. i— distinct violation of the treaty provisions 61 - of 18951| to pass without specific notice might act as an encouragement to other chiefs in the neighbourhood of Aden to disregard the provisions of their own treaties whenever it suited them to do aggrandize himself in the direction of Balahaf should be stopped, once for aU» as his intrigues must needs produce unrest in the district. 22 T,. n ' I am therefore to suggest that, if His Excellency in Council sees no objection, the Resident should be instructed to issue a formal notiQcation for communication to Sultans Mohsinand Saleh, to the Kayti Sultan and to any other chiefs who may he concerned, to the effect that Sultan Saleh’s cession of territory to the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, having been made in violation of his treaty engagements without the previous sanction of the Resident, is null and void and will be so treated. It might be advisable to inform Saltan Saleh specifically that his irregular action is one of the reasons for his deposition. O. C. Pm#, Siml*.»No, 4S1 F. D.«*4r7'04*—li.—-H. A.

This information we had already received from Sultan Ghalib and we wrote to you at the time that the matter was being reported to Government. The great Government now desire that you should explain how it is that you sold your share without letting them know in accordance with your treaty obligations. This explanation is urgently required by Government and we would ask you to send it at once. We would advise you, oh friend, as we have done in our previous letter, that pending the receipt of final orders of Government about Balahaf affairs you should preserve the peace. May you be preserved. Translation of a letter dated El Hijja 1322 (February 1905). From— Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla, the Wahidi of Balahaf, To— Major-General H, M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden.

Your order is on our heads a,G we place our possession at Balahaf under security of God and our master Jesus Christ as well as the great British Government.

Then he and his brother made treachery at sea by plundering considerable property from the poor on the sea and the poor were oppressed. Afterwards the disturbance and quarrel took place between us and them for your sake. Now when they observed the false is from you they brought Bedouins and spies by money and gave you false evidence.

Pn reference to your No. 1806, dated the 18th ultimo, concerning Balahaf affairs, I have the honour to inform you that I am arranging for my FirstAssistant Resident to visit Balahaf on the 1st proximo, with a view to holding a local inquiry into the rights of the family concerned over the Port, and also with a view to ascertaining on the spot the wishes of all the members of the family and of the Sheikhs and Akils of the Wahidi both in regard to the Sultanship and the true interests of the Port of Balahaf. 2. I am directing my First Assistant Resident after holding this enquiry to bring the leading Akils and Sheikhs concerned into Aden with a view to an ultimate settlement of their affairs being arrived at here, subject of course to the final approval of Government, to whom a full report will be submitted upon the conclusion of the inquiry. 3. Meanwhile in reference to the degree of interest in the Port of Balahaf with which Sultan Saleh has endeavoured to part, I have the honour to invite reference to the deeds of sale submitted to Government with this office No 626 of the 9th February; 1905 wherein reference is made to the famous and well known half of the Port of Balahaf and of the Port of Khisat JaPa together with all rights of administration and suzerainty on the coast and inland on all sides of the Port, and also to paragraph 6 of this office letter No. 200, dated 27th November 1904 where it was reported as the result of personal inquiry then made that half the customs dues were sent to Sultan Saleh and half to Mohsin. 4. From the statement appended to this office letter No. 142, dated 9th January 1905 it w ould, however, appear that Sultan Saleh’s share in the Port was formerly ^th and is now only gVh 8 - And further local inquiry thus seems advisable to clear up remaining doubts on this particular point. 5. I have further the honour to invite consideration of the fact that the deeds of sale above referred to mention “ all rights of administration and suzerainty on the coast and inland on all sides of the Port,” but that in this office letter No. 200, dated 27th November 1904, the Port is described as the ruins of a fort and a few huts built of mats and it is there stated that the port was maintained merely as a customs post for the collection of dues on exports and imports such as oamelVhair cloth, jowari and kerosine oil, and that only about 20 to 30 men w r ere ordinarily stationed there for collection of those dues. f lhe proposed further local inquiry will, it is hoped, clear up any remaining doubts as to rights of suzerainty and administration included in the so-called shares in the Port of Balahaf. 4 G.

Letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 200, dated the 18th January 1905. continuation of previous corres pondence on the subject of Balahaf affairs, I am now directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of the papers noted in the margin. 2 It mav be convenient to re-capitulate briefly the recent history of Balahaf. With their letter No. 1230-E., dated the 20th July 1891, the Govern ment of India sanctioned the recommendations of this Government that (a) Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla should be recognised as titular Chief of Balahaf in place of Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh, who had been deposed; that this recognition should have effect from the 3rd May 1894, and that the full stipend of 10 dollars a month should, in future, be paid to Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla ; n&gt;\ a fresh protectorate treaty should he entered into with the new Chief l ) in thc name of himself and his relations in hen of the one executed on the 30th April 1888 ; and tel the stipend of 10 dollars a month, withheld since the 1st September { ) 1893, P and due up to the 3rd of May. 1894, should be paid to the sharers in Balahaf, less the share which would have been received by Sultan Mohsin but for his misconduct. In naraaraph 3 of the same letter the Government of directed the incorporation in the new treaty with the Sultan of Balahaf o a cUuse bind- in^tKibe n Qt to dispose of its territory to any power other than the British Government. In 1901 the Bombay Government, in their Resolution No. 2845, dated IGtli April 1901, declined to accede to a proposal of the Resident at Aden which wJuld have subverted the orders of 1894 by recognising Mohs.n in place of Saleh as titular Sultan. In 1902 in connection with the outrage on the huggalow A ..j .If to the forcuoing order of this Government, the Govern- mentof India issued instructions with their letter No. 2051 h., dated the con 19762 r 4tb October 1902, as to tbe treatment to be meted out to Balabaf and Mobsin bin Saleh. In consequence of those events Sultan Ahmed bin Saleh, tbe favourite brother of Mobsin bin Saleh, was interned at Aden, pending the submission of Mobsin, the repayment by him of the monies taken and the furnishing by him of guarantees that he was prepared to conduct himself, and to cause his followers to conduct themselves, in a fitting manner in submission to the orders of Government. 3. Mohsin bin Saleh duly paid up the cash taken from the buggalow, but has failed until recently to tender his submission in accordance with the require ments of the Government of India. The correspondence now forwarded indicates that there may have been some misunderstanding on the part of Mohsin, due to his belief that he was entitled to expect the release of Ahmed on payment of the monies taken from the Fateh-al-Salam-, it also shows how, in accordance with instructions from this Government, General Mason proceeded to Balahaf on the 22nd November 1904, hoping to find Mohsin bin Saleh either at Balahaf or sufficiently near to be accessible. Unfortunately the event proved that he was not within a distance which rendered it possible for the Besident to await his response to the summons which he had sent. General Mason however, left an order requiring Mohsin to present himself at Aden within three weeks^ and guaranteeing, if he came, his safe conduct and personal liberty, requiring only that he should remain at Aden until the Government’s orders* were received. In response to this summons Mohsin duly appeared before the Besident at Aden on the 8th December last, and attached to General Mason’s letter of the 11th December is a report of the interview which ensued. This Government, I am to say, were not entirely satisfied with the degree of Mohsin’s submission as then reported by General Mason, and consequently o Cnnv PT^inQPd referred back to the Besident for information upon six Py * specific points (vide my letter No. 8010* dated the 29th December 1904). 4. General Mason’s reply dated the 9th January and the enclosures to that letter would have placed this Government in a position to form a definite con clusion as to the precise attitude which, in their opinion, should be adopted in dealing with Balahaf affairs, and definite proposals would have been formulated but for the receipt of the Besident s telegram dated the 18th January, reporting that Sultan Ghalib, the son of the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, had eifected the purchase^ from Sultan Saleh, the titular Sultan, of the latter’s share in Balahaf. This report naturally complicated matters, and the receipt of the further telegrams from the Resident, dated the 27th and 23th January last, rendered it necessary to decide immediately whether, with a view to ensuring order in Balahaf, it was not desirable to permit Mohsin, subject to due guaran tees for his behaviour, to return to Balahaf. This permission was accorded on the conditions in this Governments telegram dated the 31st January. 5. The Besident at Aden has now been directed to obtain and submit Saleh’s explanation of the recent transaction between him and Sultan Ghalib, and a further report will be made to the Government of India after General Mason has replied to this reference.

Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. 1 have the honour to report that in pursuance of the instructions contained in vour No. 6864, dated the 9th November 1904, I started from Aden tor Balahaf in the R. I. M. S. Dalhousi^ at 6 p . m . on the 22nd instant, arriving at the latter place on the 23rd idem at 7 p . m . 2 It was hoped that Mohsin bin Saleh would be either at Balahaf or at his usual head-quarters, Izzan, about 50 miles from Balahaf. Immediately on arrival I sent my interpreter on shore. He brought back news that Holism was neither at Balahaf nor at Izzan, but had proceeded to some &lt; place about 24 hours’ journey further away from Izzan, and that even if intimation were to be sent'to Mohsin by the quickest means available, it would not be possible for him to meet me before 1 the 2nd December at the earliest. I could not, of course, wait this length of time in view of the xact that Laid Curzon is shortly to pass Aden on his way to India. S I remained, however, the whole night and landed the next morning, and mv personal enquiry confirmed the news brought by the interpreter as i vnTriracticability of Mohsin meeting me before the 2nd proximo. I thereupon decided to return, which I did on the afternoon of the 21th instant, leaving however, the interpreter behind with a letter from me to Mo sin, in which 3 ! explained to the latter that the intended interview could not take nlace at Bakhaf, and that the only course left for him was to come to Aden I guaranteed hiii safe conduct and promised that his personal liberty would not be interfered with, though it would be necessary for him to remain in Aden, till such time as the orders of Government were received. In the letter I warned hi “also that, in the event of his not coming to Aden Government would be orced to renew the blockade of Balahaf, and possibly to take such measures as may be necessary to compel his ejection from Balahaf territory. 4 Before leaving Balahaf I had also taken the opportunity of interviow- imr in tlm presence ot the Balahaf Customs officer and two others who had ^ nn board the prisoner Ahmed bin Saleh, whom I bad brought wit i me S case he m jhtt P r“d, and impressed upon him that his conknemen ISTheen UtonTVfect^ch I thought it wouldV as well for Mohsin to know not S ^om the letter which I caused Ahmed bin Saleh to write to his brother, hut also from the lips of his own men. ^ I mav mention here that the port of Balahaf consists merely of the • th^forto demolished under the orders of Government about two years ruins ot the loruetaemon- ts _ At Balahaf there is no water, and a half ago a “ ® a pi aoe distant about three hours’ journey.

Besides a. certai o ^ hi tllat his duty alter collecting the d “s te^end imlf to llohsin aSd half to Saleh bin Abdulla, that the con 1977— *12 soldiers were stationed there both on behalf of Mohsin and Saleh, that they as well as the tribesmen, however, recognised Mohsin as the Sultan, he being a man of greater firmness of character than Saleh, and that even better than Mohsin they would prefer Ahmed bin Saleh. News had also lately reached Balahaf that Mohsin and Saleh had come to some understanding, the terms of which, however, were not known yet. 7. The Customs officer as well as others in Balahaf all say that Mohsin has no desire to act against Government, but he fears to come in lest he should he imprisoned like his brother, or perhaps even worse may happen to him. For this mistrust, which Mohsin entertains in spite of the promise of safe conduct given to him before, we ourselves seem to be responsible in a way, for, at the time the fortlet of Balahaf was destroyed as a punishment for the act of piracy committed on the sambook Fateh-al-Salam, Mohsin bin Saleh and Saleh bin Abdulla were given to understand that Ahmed bin Saleh would he detained as prisoner and the port of Balahaf would be closed pending restitution of the looted property. After prolonged negotiations the plundered specie was restored, hut in the meantime orders having been received from Government insisting upon the personal submission of Mohsin, Ahmed bin Saleh continues to be detained as a hostage, and even the closure of the port was maintained up to December last, which Mohsin regards as a violation of the original under standing. 8. I have, however, hopes that Mohsin will come in, considering the overtures we have made in trying to meet him in his own territory. Should he not come in, I propose calling again at Balahaf on my way to or from Mokalla, which it is my intention to visit in the early part of December. I am disposed to make this further attempt to bring about an interview with Mohsin in order that matters may be settled peacefully, as I am of opinion that the nature of the country and the scarcity of water would render military operations difficult. Letter No. 204, dated the 11th December 1904. From—Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden ; To—C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay Political Department. In continuation of my telegram of the 8th instant, I have the honour to inform you that I had an interview (memorandum of which is attached hereto) with Mohsin bin Saleh of Balahaf to-day. 2. There is no doubt that Mohsin is a man of very strong character : this is at once apparent on speaking to him. I have also obtained information to this effect in Aden from merchants who trade with Balahaf, and this has been confirmed by Abdul Bab Salim, interpreter of this Residency, upon whom I can place much reliance and who was in Balahaf and in the villages.in its neighbourhood for about three weeks. 8 . I consider that Mohsin had reason to doubt our good faith, for it is actually on record that Mohsin was informed that his brother Ahmed bin Saleh would be detained until the $6,020, which Mohsin had taken from the dhow which was wrecked near Balahaf, be paid. The money was p’aid, but Ahmed was kept a prisoner and the promise thus broken. 4. The statement of Mohsin that on receiving the letter from the Resident at Izzan it was his intention to follow the messenger with the money to Balahaf, but that he could not travel as fast as he did, seems to be true. The distance from Izzan to Balahaf is 50 miles, and I understand that Mohsin was given only four days from date of letter by the Resident in which to come in. 5. I would bring to the notice of Government the complete submission of Mohsin to me, and I think he is willing to agree to any terms Government may make. 6. Saleh bin Abdulla went to Balahaf while Mohsin was there, the latter having 200 to 800 followers, while Saleh had about 10 men with him, and they w T ere jeered at for accompanying him. He is evidently a mere puppet with no power or position whatever.7. Should Government not be disposed to accept Mohsin’s explanation regarding what has been called his “ refractory conduct,” that is, that he distrusted the Aden officials and for that reason did not come in, then I would propose that his brother Ahmed bin Saleh be elected Sultan. Report of interview held at the Residency Office at 10-30 a.m. on Saturday, 10th December 1904, between Saltan Mohsin bin Saleh, the Wahidi, and Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Lieut.-Colonel J. Davies, First Assistant Resident, being also present. Reason for not coming in sooner. After the usual salutations Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh was asked by the Resident why he had not come in for such a long time, although Government required him to do so. To this he replied that the previous officers had not o-iven him an opportunity for a fair hearing, and he thought it would have been useless for him to come in, as he feared that justice would not be done to him. Sultan Mohsin was inclined to go into a long history on this point, but the Resident stopped him and reminded him that his brother had been confined all this time owing to his refractory behaviour. Submission. Mohsin still went on dwelling on the unfairness shown towards him. The Resident again interrupted him and explained to him that as a preliminary to all negotiations as to his personal rights and liberties he should tender his unconditional submission to Government. Mohsin immediately responded by unbelting his sword and handing it to the Resident, who, pleased at this spontaneous act of submission, returned the sword to Mohsin. Mohsiris own views. The Resident then permitted Mohsin to proceed with his history.^ Mohsin alluded to the incident of the dhow. He stated that on hearing that a bu^alow had been wrecked off Balahaf he proceeded to the port to render the necessary assistance. He arrived at Balahaf and made all arrangements for the safetv and comfort of the crew. Thereafter, finding that the men had specie with' them, he made enquiries as to its ownership and learnt that it did not belon- to any one on board the dhow, but that some belonged to merchants in Aden and some to persons in Mokalla. Mohsin then took charge of the snecie with a view to its eventual delivery to the proper owners, and advised the crew to wait, as it would be difficult and unsafe to go by sea^ owing to the monsoon The men, however, did not wait, but reported against him both at Mokalla and Aden. Meanwhile, as there was no safe place to keep the large sL o“ ey at Balahaf, he took the specie with him to Azzan. Some time after in reference to this matter, he received a letter at Azzan asking him o meet’ the Resident at Balahaf. Though he could not travel at the same rate as the runner who brought the letter, he proceeded as fast ^ he could with the monev but only to hear, when he was some distance off Balahaf, the bomb aid mentPof the port. He learnt also that his brother Ahmed Inn Sateh had gone cm board tbe steamer, offered to remain as a hostage till he (Moiisin; iiaa bm Hit the money, and besought the officers to wait and not demolish the fort Aliped bin Saleh was told that orders had already been received from Government and the demolition of the fort was proceeded with m spite ot the enteeato of Ahmed bin Saleh, who protested that the great Government would under no circumstances act so hastily.

Mohsin scorned the very idea. He stated that Saleh bin Abdulla was a mere nonentity and was absolutely useless in the administration of the country ; that his only business was to come to Aden from time to time and to receive his stipend and such other presents as the Resident was disposed to give; and that he (Mohsin) could never think of submitting to such a man. He urged that he was the actual ruler during the past fourteen years, and that he was the only Sultan who was recognised by the tribesmen, and that therefore Government should accord their recognition to his Sultanate. It was then explained to him that the Resident himself was not aware of the views of Government on this particular point, and that it was not certain that Government would recognise him, having regard to his past conduct. Mohsin then earnestly declared that it was never his intention to disobey Government, of whose mighty power he was well aware, that it was fear that prevented him from coming, that he is now submissive, as he always wished to he, to Government and would continue to be so and would even “ give his own head ” for Government. Should, however, Government be not disposed to recognise Mohsin, he wished that he should not be held responsible for anything. It was then pointed out to him that he should not be at the bottom of any trouble, as the great Government had a long arm and would strike hard. To this he agreed, but he again repeated that he was the only Chief recognised by the tribesmen, and that he was the only one who could arrange the tribal affair to their satisfaction. Here the interview practically ended, but with a view to ascertain how Mohsin would regard the situation in the event of Government according the Sultanate to Ahmed bin Saleh, the Resident incidentally asked Mohsin whether he was fond of his elder brother Ahmed, and he replied that he was fond of him, but gave no indication from which it could be inferred that he would either agree or absolutely refuse to accept the Sultanate of Ahmed bin Saleh. Mohsin w r as thereupon further ques tioned that if he was fond of his brother, as he professed to be, why he did not come in and submit before this so as to secure his brother’s release earlier. He replied that he w 7 as afraid that if he did come he w 7 ould also have been imprisoned along with his brother. After making one or two requests, the chief one being that as he had come in and submitted his brother should be given some freedom to move about, to which the Resident assented, Mohsin took his departure, promising to remain in Aden till such time as the orders of Government were received. Letter No. 8010, dated the 29th December 1904. From—C. H. A. Hill, Esq., O.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department ; To—Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 204, dated the 11th December 1904, relative to affairs at Baiahai. 2. In reply I am to request that you will submit, for the information of Government, the record referred to in paragraph 3 of your letter, showing that Mohsin w r as informed that his brother Ahmed bin Saleh w r ould be detained until the $6,020 which Mohsin bad taken from the dhow which was wrecked near Balahaf had been paid, and to request, with reference to para graph 2 of this Department letter No. 7338, dated the loth October 1902, and paragraph 19 of your office letter No. 196, dated the 19th July 1902, and letter No. 378, dated the 4th December 1902, that you will explain (1) why you consider that the payment of $6,020 represented “restitution in full of the stolen property”; (2) how any promise of the kind you refer to could have been given to Mohsin in view of the orders of Government and Brigadier- General Maitland’s reply thereto ; (3) why you consider that Government5 should accept the statements made by Mohsin in spite of his letters at the time to Sultan Ghalib and his then action as reported by the Political Resident; (4) how you reconcile Mohsin’s “complete” submission with his refusal to submit to the arrangements at Balahaf made by the Sheikhs in 1894 and confirmed by Government in 1895. 3. I am at the same time to observe that the orders of the Government of India, on which this Department letter No. 7538, dated the 15th October 1902, was based, require the complete submission of Mohsin to the existing position and guarantees for his future good conduct, and that he will do his utmost to co-operate in maintaining the position sanctioned by Government, unless it is altered with their approval and sanction. The Governor in Council would be glad to learn what Mohsin proposes to do to satisfy Government on this point and what guarantees he proposes to furnish that his own conduct is loyal and good, and that his influence on the tribe is used to maintain the existing order. His Excellency in Council cannot place much value on a submission which is simply a candidature for the titular Chief ship of the tribe ^ and a disclaimer of all responsibility, if unsuccessful; and Mohsin should be given to understand that he will be held responsible for his personal conduct. 4 . I am also to request that you will furnish Government with an exact statement 'of the terms and promises on which Mohsin is at present at Aden, together with a copy of the letter on which he came in. 5. In conclusion, I am to invite a perusal of Brigadier-General Jopp s letter No. 20, dated the 5th May 1894, especially paragraph 11 and accompani ment F, and to enquire whether the shares in Balahaf are still distributed on the same basis, and who would now be competent to bind the tribe by a document such as Appendix F to that letter. Letter No. 112, dated the 9th January 1905. From—Major-General H. M, Mason, Political Resident, Aden , To— C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to your letter No. 8010, dated the 29th December 1901, relative to the affairs of Balahaf, I have the honour to f^rd, heremth, a copy of the translation of the letter dated the 13th August , Mohsin bin Saleh by the then acting Resident, Lieut.-Colonel Abud, m Mohsin was informed that Ahmed bin Saleh would not be released ui t looted specie was restored. I enclose also copies of trans atio . , Saleh L Abdulla and Ahmed bin Saleh to a similar effeet. The above promise, it will he seen, was conveyed to Mohsin long before the receipt of the orders of Government, which were dated the loth October 19J2 and reach Aden till the 23rd idem. 2 The whole of the looted specie consisting of |R,020 and Its. 140 w-as ftu Vt^lSTopU, 6 rUZ^xidain that the restitution of the specie. This was presumably b ^ a f f ® '“X as to what became of the other goods f 9 lM2 P ^ P Lieut.-Colonel Abud’s letter No. 196, dated the 19th J uly DO-. 3 In regard to the third query in your letter, enquiring why I consider that Government should -eptV— ^ t con 1977—2wreck and to restore the specie, which he was all along willing to surrender. This contention is not a new one, but he has maintained it from the very com mencement as will appear from his letters to this Kesidency, dated the 25th July and 7th September 1902 (copies of translations enclosed). Of course, in the letters to Sultan Ghalib referred to by Government, Mohsin appears to have spoken of surrendering the money if he were allowed to retain a share of it. To this he has made no reference in his present statement, hut it seems to me that in writing to the above effect to Sultan Ghalib he really meant only to claim salvage money like other Chiefs on the coast, as will be evident from his letter of 7th September 1902 cited above. It appears to me, therefore, that there is sincerity in Mohsin’s explanation. 4. As to how I reconcile Mohsin’s complete submission with his refusal to submit to the arrangements at Balahaf made by the Sheikhs in 1894 and confirmed by Government in 1895, I can only say that he has now seen the error of his ways by realizing the power of Government, the magnitude of which I took great care to impress upon him both in my letter asking him to come in and also at the interviews I had with him. It would appear on enquiry from Sultan Abdulla bin Hussain and Abdul Kadir bin Abdul Latif and other Sheikhs, who are all present with me, that Mohsin bin Saleh was not deposed as stated in the document (marked E, herewith attached, with translation for the perusal of Government). I 1 he two Sheikhs mentioned by name also state on being shown the document that they never saw it previous to this, and that their signatures are forged. I have taken their signatures which are absolutely different from those in the document. It will be seen that the signatures on the document are in the hand-writing of one person, which seems to prove that the document is a fictitious one. However this may be, from all the conversa tions I have had with Mohsin I fully believe that he really means to be loyal and submissive to Government, and the reluctance that he has manifested to accept the present Sultanate *is due more to a sense of pride, making it difficult for him to serve under a man who is a mere puppet, rather than a wish to be a candidate for the titular Chiefship. He has, however, now promised that he will submit to the existing position, that is, as the Sultanate now stands, if Govern ment are disinclined to alter it, that his future conduct will be loyal and good, that he will co-operate to the utmost in maintaining the position sanctioned by Government; and as a guarantee of his assurance he has agreed to give the only security he is in a position to offer, viz., that one of his two brothers, Ahmed and Husen, and he himself will each remain at a time in Aden, Husen taking his turn first and his own turn being undertaken within three months from the date of his return to Balahaf after the receipt of the orders of Govern ment, as he requires time to arrange about his private affairs. 5. The exact terms and promises on which Mohsin is at present in Aden will be apparent from the letter which I wrote to him asking him to come in (copy enclosed). 6. As to the shares in the port of Balahaf, I read out to Sultan Abdulla bin Hasan named above the list given in paragraph 11 of General Jopp’s letter No. 20, dated the 5th May 1891. He tailed to understand the distribu tion therein given and stated that it was incorrect, and that the original distri bution was as shown in the accompanying statement. But he explained that subsequently, about six years ago, a re-distribution took place which is shown below the statement mentioned above, the documents pertaining to that dis tribution being written in his own hand. 7. With reference to the concluding portion of the last paragraph of your letter under reply, I would add that in view of what has been stated above it seems to me that there will be nobody competent forthcoming to bind the tribe by a document similar to document E of 1894.{Copy.)

We inform you, oh friend, that we have already addressed you a letter and sent it by a special messenger to Sultan Ahmed Padth-al Abdali. We inform ed you therein that we have received your letter, and that we have not the amount that you mentioned. You have destroyed our places, detained our brother Ahmed bin Saleh as a prisoner and closed the ports of Balahaf to trade. This action is not conformable with the treaty between you and us. The bug-galow was wrecked. We did not plunder it. We shall submit to your orders regarding the specie and are ready to pay it, but the sea to our ports is closed, and there is’ dread in the interior. When the season for trade opens we shall send the same to our brother Ahmed bin Saleh. Should you then find that we are entitled, according to rule, to any salvage such as the Fadthli and others get, then we request it. We want your friendship. Perhaps Saleh bin Abdulla has written to you with the intention of getting the Sultanate and the treaty. He has no power to do so. There is customary practice betwen us, the Arabs. You wrote to him to fight us. Your Government will give no countenance to such an order and, further, that we are not at fault. We also inform you that Jamadar Awadth bin Omar is desirous to exert his influence upon some of our countries and ports, hence he is sending an expedition. We are under your protection. We hold a letter from you and have an assurance. We have formerly complained to you, and you have replied that he cannot interfere with us.

M e came in our steamer to the port of Balahaf with the special object of having an interview with you. We had also brought with us your brother, Ahmed bin Saleh. But when we came here we ascertained from your men that you were about three days’ journey from this place, and that it would he impossible for you to meet us before the end of a week. We could not, however, wait all that time here as there are important matters to be attended to in Aden. We are, therefore, going back to-day. But before doing so we leave this letter for you with our Interpreter, Abdul Bab, whom we are leaving here. He will give it to you personally or send it according to circumstances.You know full well that your conduct in not tendering your submission, when you were asked to do so, has been greatly displeasing to the British Government, Yet the great Government were good enough to order us to oome and see you in your own country, so that we might personally ascertain and report all that you had to say regarding your behaviour. But this inter view cannot take place here as we have already said above. Your only course now is to come to Aden and see us. This you must do within three weeks of the date of this letter. Failing this, you know what the power of the great Government can do. They will be compelled to renew the blockade of Balahaf, and possibly to take such measures as may be necessary to compel your ejection from Balahaf territory. This is the last chance that Government are giving you, and you will be acting wisely in taking advantage of it. If you come to Aden I guarantee your safe conduct, and your personal liberty will not be interfered with. This is our word, and you may put faith in it. We must, however, tell you that when you come to Aden it will be necessary for you to remain there till such time as the orders of Government are received. We will talk more fully about matters when you come to us, which we hope you will do without fail. May you be preserved. (Signed) H. M. Mason, Major-General, Political Resident, Aden.

Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In continuation of my telegram of to-day’s date, I have the honour to state that at the interview which I had with Sultan Mohsin bin Saleh at the time of writing my letter No. 142, dated the 9th January 1905, regarding Balahaf affairs, he reported to me that he had received information that, taking advantage of his absence, Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla had clandestinely sold a portion of Balahaf to His Highness the Sultan of Shehr^ and Mokalla. He seemed to view the news with some alarm. But I set his mind at rest by saying that 1 did not credit the rumour, as nothing of the kind could happen without the knowledge or consent of this Residency. The news has, however, been confirmed by Sultan Ghalib, who has written* to me ° Appendix A. saying that a settlement has been arrived at between Saleh bin Abdulla and himself, whereby the former has sold to him half of Balahaf and Jila’, together with their dependencies on the sea-coast and inland, that a document has been drawn up giving effect to the transaction, and that nothing remains to be done except to have my signature on the document in token of confirmation. I have replied t to Sultan t Appendix B. . Ghalib to the effect that I cannot confirm such an agreement which has been entered into without my knowledge or consent, and that I am therefore reporting the matter to Government for orders. 2. Having regard to the opinion expressed by the Government of India in paragraph 2 of Boreign Department letter No. 1094-E.A., dated the 5th July 1897, embodied in the preamable of Government Resolution No. 4653, dated the 27th July 1897, it seems to me that Sultan Ghalib should have apprised this Residency beforehand of the fact that the above negotiations were in contemplation, even though Saleh bln Abdulla did not care to disclose it. Moreover, the transaction in question, if accepted by Government, will, I am certain, give rise to constant friction between the bultan of bhehr and Mokalla and the co-sharers in the port of Balahaf, particularly as the sale of Saleh bin Abdulla’s share has been effected without the knowledge and approval of the latter. I would, therefore, recommend that Government should not accord their confirmation to the transaction. A.

From—The Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, Bombay, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Please see Foreign Department letter No. 3735 E. B., dated the 2nd November 1904&lt;, regarding Balahaf affairs. Mohsin-bin-Saleh arrived at Aden on 8th December, and tendered formal submission to Resident on 10th. Following telegrams have been received from Resident, dated 18th, 27lh, and 28th January. My letter No. 142, dated 9th January. Sultan Ghalib of Maculla has written that Sultan Saleh-bin-Abdulla has sold his share of Balahaf to him. He only awaited my signature to confirmation of the deed of sale. No reference was made to me about this. I have replied that I could not possibly give my consent without reference to Government. I do not recommend it. Letter follows. Since my telegram of the 18th January, reporting purchase of share of Balahaf by Sultan Ghalib, Mohsin has shown me a letter, purporting to be from Ghalib to Customs official, Balahaf, informing him of purchase and of his intention to proceed to Balahaf shortly, and ordering him to have accounts of Customs due ready. Ghalib may have written this letter before receipt of mine, refusing recognition of purchase pending the receipt of Government orders. To-day Mohsin has shown me another letter from some of his principal tribesmen, displaying alarm at rumoured purchase of Balahaf, and expressing intention to commence hostilities. Mohsin’s younger brother, Hussen, arrived to-day and confirmed this. Mohsin wishes to go Balahaf to prevent hostilities. I have refused permission pending instructions. Meanwhile I am sending Ghalib and Saleh-bin-Abdulla by Elphinstone to-morrow morning, warning them to refrain from any action likely to lead to disturbance, and also a letter from Mohsin to his principal tribesmen, urging them not to commence hostilities. I have just interviewed Mohsin. He asked that he may be allowed to leave Aden within four days’ time, and proceed with his brother, Ah mad-bin-Saleh, to Balahaf to keep matters quiet, leaving a third brother, Hussen, who is now here, as a hostage. If this be permitted, he promised to return himself to Aden within two and-a-half months from date. I recommend this, particularly as the plague is bad, which has frightened him. I believe Mohsin to be sincere. He stated distinctly that, if his brother, Ahmad-bin-Saleh, is not allowed to proceed with him, he cannot himself return to Aden, as he will be too ashamed before his tribesmen. Please reply by telegraph within the time mentioned, as I cannot detain Mohsin longer under my promise of personal liberty to him. The following reply, dated 31st January, has been sent to Political Resident:— Correspondence ending with your telegram of 28th January. See paragraph 4 of your letter No. 142, dated 9th January. Provided you are satisfied as to Mohsin’s bona fidea in submitting existing position and as to validity of the guarantee which Mohsin proposes, namely, that he and his brother will take it in turn to remain in Aden as sureties, Government authorise your permitting Mohsin and Ahmad to proceed to Balahaf for purposes of maintaining peace on following understanding: namely (1), that Hussen remains at Aden; (2) that if Mohsin fails to return to Aden otherwise than with permission of Residency on expiration of two months and-a-half, Government will be free to reconsider views taken regarding his position and claims, and will give him 1 no further consideration. A full report will he submitted shortly by letter regarding future of Balahaf.

Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter Eo. 6?,04, dated the 10th October 1904, on the subject of Palahaf affairs. 2. The Governor in Council proposes to instruct General Mason to proceed to Balahaf at the earliest possible moment and to bring about an interview between himself and Sultan Tohsin in a manner which is indicated in your letter under acknowledgment. His Excellency also suggests that in order that the Resident at Aden may be fully apprised of the motives which actuate Government, a copy of the same letter should be forwarded to him for information and guidance. 3 . I am to state that these proposals are approved by the Government of India. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, Assistant Secretary to the Government of India.[Confidential] lo t-f /'I No. 6201-, dated Bombay Castle, the 10th October 1904. From—C. H A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with Mr. Russell’s letter No. 3018-E.A. of the 28th December last, on the subject of Balahaf affairs. 2. It is perhaps unnecessary to go further back than the previous letter, dated the 5th June 1901, in considering the present state of affairs, and I am only to remind the Government of India of the circumstances of 1894, in which year Mohsin, after disputing the authority not only of the Sultan but of the British Government, endeavoured, after flying to Obokh, to negotiate the sale of Balahaf to the French. 3. In pursuance of the necessity for ascertaining the progress of affairs among the Wahidis my letter No. 5234 of the 23rd August 1904, of which I attach a copy, was addressed to the Resident at Aden whose reply, No. 172 of the 23rd September, I now enclose. 4. The position, as the Government of India are aware, is, stated briefly, that Sultan Saleh, the recognised Chief, has been given such support as has been possible and has been pressed to make every endeavour to bring about the submission of Sultan Mohsin whose brother Ahmed 6m Saleh has been interned at Aden during the past two years. Until last December the Port of Balahaf was blockaded as an additional inducement to the Wahidis to bring about the submission of the refractory Mohsin. It will be observed from the Resident’s letter, which I now forward, that Saleh bin Abdulla has shown little or no energy and has certainly achieved no success in his endeavours to undermine Mohsin’s influence and to bring the latter under his control; and, from the circumstances reported, the Governor in Council is driven to the conclusion that Saleh does not command sufficient influence among the Wahidis to enable him to bring about this result. 5. The question that arises is whether we should now withdraw the recognition and support which we have hitherto accorded to Sultan Saleh. On the one hand, while we have consistently insisted on his recognition and have, short of armed assistance, rendered him such countenance as was possible, he has undoubtedly failed to make his influence felt, or to bring about a satisfactory arrangement at Bir Ali and Balahaf. On the other hand, having regard to the history of Mohsin’s career, the Governor in Council could in no circumstances recommend his recognition by Government. A third possibility is suggested in the letter from General Mason, dated the 23rd September, namely, the ultimate recognition of Ahmed bin Saleh, our prisoner, who it will appear is capable, or would, if released, be capable, of exercising an efficient control over the Wahidis. 6. On a consideration of all the circumstances in the case the Governor in Council is inclined to the view that Ahmed bin Saleh may ultimately prove to be the person to whom we should look for co-operation with the British Government in the maintenance of order at Balahaf; but before any definite change in policy is imroducel His Excellency considers it imperative that the Resident should proceed in person or, should, if unable to do this, depute his First Assistant Resident, to Balahaf with a view to making local enquiries. He should on arrival there send for Mohsin bin Saleh and should be authorised in doing so to inform him that if he comes in to meet the Resident he will be guaranteed safe conduct and that his personal liberty will not be interfered with. He should be warned that, if he fails to come in and meet the Resident, Government will be compelled to renew the blockade of Balahaf and possibly to take such measures as may be necessary to compell his ejection from Balahaf territory.2 I ■■■ i 7. If and when he comes in the Uesident should explain to him that as a first preliminary to any negotiations regarding his personal rights and liberty he will be required to make submission to Government unconditionally. No guarantee should be given to him as to what the action of Government would sub sequently be, though in point of fact the Governor in Council does not consider that it would be necessary to confine him in Aden, at all events for any con siderable time. Mohsin should be required to state his own views and grievances for the consideration of the British Government, and be requested to indicate the reasons he may have for declining to submit to the authority of Saleh, and to indicate the conditions upon which he would be prepared to accord such submission. He should be informed that the confinement of his brother Ahmed has been continued solely because of his own refractory behaviour and that the future treatment of both must depend largely on the attitude Mohsin may take up. 8 . Whatever the result may be, the Governor in Council thinks that a personal interview between him and the Resident such as has been suggested cannot but prove to be of value. His Excellency is unable to recommend compliance with the Resident’s request that before he proceeds to Balahaf he should be apprised of the policy of Government, since it is obvious that that policy must depend very largely upon the position assumed by Mohsin. Eor the moment, and unless some kind of desire for reconciliation is manifested by Mohsin, the Bombay Government are doubtful of the expediency of indicating an intention to recognise Mohsin’s brother Ahmed in any w r ay and w T ould be loth to offer any sort of inducement, based upon his release or elevation to power, to Mohsin. Consequently His Excellency in Council proposes merely to instruct General Mason to proceed to Balahaf at the earliest possible moment and to bring about an interview with Mohsin in the manner indicated above. In order that the Resident may be fully appraised of the motives which actuate Government, His Excellency suggests that, if the Government of India agree, a oapy of this letter should also be forwarded to General Mason for his information and guidance. No. 5234, dated Bombay Castle, the 23rd August 1904 From—C. H. A. Hill, Esq, C.l E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To — Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden. With reference to your Confidential letter No. 157, dated the 7tb August 1901, regarding the present position of affairs at Balahaf, I am directed to state that the Governor in Council approved of the suggestion made by General Maitland at the close of paragraph o of bis letter No. 2^8, dated the 23rd October 1903, that the policy to be followed should be that of inducing Mohsin to accept Saleh as Sultan of Balahaf. His Excellency in Council will accordingly be glad to learn whether this policy has been consistently followed, and, if so, to be furnished with a report shewing precisely what steps have been taken by you and your predecessor towards inducing Mohsin to accept Saleh as Sultan. 2 . I am at the same time to request that you will indicate more clearly the measures which you contemplate to secure the submission of Mohsin, and that you will ascertain and report the extent of Mohsin’s influence and power in the State and whether he is recognised by any of the other tribes. 3 . I am to enquire from what source you have derived the information that Sultan Saleh is unable to make any real headway against Mohsin. No. 172, dated Aden Residency, the 23rd September 1904. From— Major-Genkral H. M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden, To—.0. H A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 5234, dated the 23rd August 1904, stating that the Governor in Council approved of the suggestion made by General Maitland in his letter No. 288, dated the23rd Oc'ober 1903, that the policy to be followed in respect to the Balahaf question should be that of inducing Mohsin bin Saleh to accept Saleh bin Abdulla as Sultan of Balahaf, and enquiring whether the policy has been consistently pursued, and if so, what steps have been taken towards attaining the desired end. It is further requested that I should indicate more clearly the measures that I contemplate to secure the submission of Mohsin and ascer tain and report the extent of Mohsin’s influence and power in the State and whether he is recognised by any of the other tribes. You also enquire from what source I have derived the information that Sultan Saleh is unable to make any real headway against Mohsin. 2 . In reply I have the honour to state that the opinion expressed in my previous letter as to the incapacity of Saleh bin Abdulla to establish his posi tion as Sultan was one which General Maitland himself left on record just a few days before his departure. He appears to have based his conclusion on information obtainable from merchants having dealings with Balahaf, Bir Ali and other places in the vicinity, and also from some of the 'Wahidi tribesmen occasionally visiting Aden, all of whom, it is reported, state that Saleh bin Abdulla carries no influence in his territory, which opinion is borne out by the fact that though Saleh bin Abdulla has repeatedly promised this Besidency that he would compel Mohsin to submit to him and punish him, he has up to date practically effected nothing. Moreover Sultan Saleh appears to be quite apathetic towards Balahaf affairs as is indicated by the inordinate length of time he remains in Aden whenever he comes in. This would also seem to lend colour to the view that Mohsin is master of the situation and Saleh is powerless. 3. As to the extent of Mohsin’s influence and power in the State, and as to whether he is recognized by any other tribes, correct information can only be obtained by enquiry on the spot, and I propose therefore, subject to the approval of Government, either to proceed myself, or to send the First Assistant Resi dent, to Balahaf in the R. I. M. S, Dalhousie with the view to making local enquiries personally. 4. By doing so an opportunity wall also be afforded to try to induce Mohsin to acknowledge Saleh bin Abdulla as Sultan. At present, as far as can be ascertained from the records, no special steps seem to have been taken in this direction except that at an interview on the 15th January 1904, a brief account of which is herewith attached, General Maitland promised that he Would consider the question of the relaxation of the stringency of the measures adopted to secure the close confinement of Ahmed bin Saleh, provided Saleh bin Abdulla succeeded in procuring the agreement which he himself had volunteered at first to obtain from Mohsin to the effect that the latter would he submissive to him. But no such agreement has yet been produced from Mohsin who, on the other hand, has authorized his brother Ahmed biu Saleh, who is detained as a hostage, to act on his behalf and enter into any conditions which the Resident may require of Mohsin. General Maitland would not however for a moment entertain the proposal to make terms with Ahmed bin Saleh and matters remain even now in statu quo. 5 . To remove this deadlock either one party or the other must yield. There seems to be no sign of Mohsin coming in and surrendering himself. At the same time it would not be wise or politic for Government to depart from the attitude taken up by them in persistently demanding from the very com mencement the personal submission of Mohsin : and I have accordingly declined to entertain the proposal, renewed by prisoner Ahmed bin Saleh {vide transla tion of his letter attached), that he should be permitted to make terms on behalf of Mohsin. Yet, if matters are to progress some move will have to be made by Government, and it was for tbis reason tbat I had recommended that some decisive action should be taken. But what the nature of that action should finally be will depend upon the facts that may be elicited during the personal visit which I have suggested above. For the present I would merely say that4 Government should declare their intention to occupy Balahaf unless Mohsin tendered his submission, as they did once before in 1894 in the case of the same refractory Mohsin, though subsequent events at the time rendered it unnecessary to resort to the extreme measure. This declaration should be conveyed as an ulti matum to Mohsin, personally if possible, and should he then show an inclination to submit, I would like to be favoured with the views of Government on two points which are likely to arise in the course of negotiations. 6. In the first place I would observe that though Mohsin has been main taining practically an attitude of defiance, his contumacious behaviour is partly to be accounted for by the fear of treachery. From the repeated attempts made by Mohsin and his brothers to ascertain what would actually befall him should he surrender, it would seem that he fears that after being cajoled into coming into Aden he may be imprisoned like his brother. As to this no definite assurance has been given to them. On the contrary, when Sultan Mohsin addressed this Residency in July 1903 on the subject, he was informed that he would certainly not be put to death and that he need fear no bodily harm, but that nothing more than this could be promised. 1 therefore venture to enquire whether in case it is necessary to make a promise that Mohsin will not be detained as a prisoner, I am at liberty to do so. 7. I would also venture to request that some indication of the ultimate views of Government in regard to the Sultanate may be communicated to me. So far as Mohsin is concerned, General Maitland, with whom I fully concur, has strongly urged that from considerations of policy it would be inadvisable to recognize him as Sultan, though he happens to be stronger than Saleh bin Abdulla. As for Saleh bin Abdulla, he has proved himself to be powerless either for good or evil, and he may therefore be ignored. Ultimately it seems to me that the mantle should fall upon the shoulders of Ahmed bin Saleh, for, from the information available at present, it would appear that the sympathies of the tribesmen are with him, and he is moreover the favourite brother of Mohsin. In the event of this information proving to be correct, I should like to be in a position to make a definite statement on this point without further reference to Government, so that I may be able to bring matters to a speedy and final conclusion. It is for this reason I am soliciting the orders of Gov ernment on this subject. Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla, the Wahidi, visited the Resident at the Residency Office at 12 noon on Friday, the 15th January 1904. Colonel H. M. Abud, First Assistant Resident, was present. After exchanging compliments, the Resident asked why he had made such a long stay in Aden. He said he wanted a reply regarding the building of a Dar at Balahaf which he said had not yet been built. He proposed to build it on the same site as the one we destroyed. The Resident remarked that if Mohsin again became the stronger we should have to go and destroy it again, and he replied that Mohsin would never again dare to do mischief, and that if he did the tribes would rise. They were unable to catch him as he was so cunning. He was reminded that he had always before said that Mohsin was shut up in his house at Azan. He says this was so. Whenever he collected the tribesmen and went against him, he shut himself up in his house, and that he had done him much damage, singeing his trees and had killed one of his men. The Resident remarked that the state of affairs was very unsatisfactory, and that he should either capture Mohsin and bring him here or he himself should come in and make his submission. He asked if Mohsin gave an agreement that be is submissive to him and guarantees not to interfere with him, would this be satisfactory. Resident said it was good, but as Mohsin had rebelled against Government, he must come in and submit. He said Mohsin was afraid of being imprisoned like his brother. Resident said it did not matter to him whether he came in or not. He said it would be an act of kindness if theResident would agree to let Ahmed live outside the chowki iu a house Resi dent said if he got the agreement he mentioned, then he would let Ahmed live m a house instead of in the chowky. He said he would get the asreement mentioned. The Resident said he would give him Rs. 500 towards the Bar and that he must return to his country and settle this matter. The interview was terminated. Aden ! l (Sd.) . H. M. ABUD, Lieut.. The 16th January 1904. ) ■ First Assistant Resident. Dated 29th Jomad Akhar 1322 (9th September 1904). From— Sultan Ahmed bin Saleh, The Wahadi of Balahaf, To— General Mason, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments.—-W q inform you, oh friend, that a long time has now passed since we have been imprisoned by you without any due causeor disobedience ol your orders on our part. The prison is nothing but a hell. We are oppressed and are now wearied and depressed. YVe never expected to receive such contemptuous and disgraceful treatment all this time, especially as we are the son and ally of Government and are submissive to your orders. We have never committed any depredation on the road, killed any person nor disobeyed the orders of Government^ in any way, and we, on the contrary, have been respecting them and their alliance and have been submissive to their orders. We now earnestlv request you to sympathise with us and to release us from the prison. Should you desire us to enter into any stipulations in addition to the treaty and other obligations already in existence for the furtherance of general peace, we are willing, so far as we are concerned, to abide by such as Government may pro pose in accordance with their law. We will acquiesce in 'all things which concern the interest of the British Government. If Government desire that a treaty of friendship should be entered into by our brother Sultan Mobsin bin Saleh, we wdll conclude the same on his behalf. We are willing to undertake terms which Government require from our brother, except that of his coming into Aden at present because he is afraid of you. Government are aware that om count'.y is inhabited by Badwins, who, on finding that Government have not kept their word, are frightening him from visiting Aden by saying to him that we who are ally of Government have not been listened to, and that we are imprisoned for more than two years without any cause and without any investi gation being made into our case, and that‘if he comes he will be dealt with similarly. They thus caused fear to prevail on him. Our brother Mohsin is not disobedient to Government, and he will not disobey or act contrary to their wishes in respect of all matters with the exception of his arrival at Aden and this is on account of the tyranny to which Government have subjected us without making any investigation. We request your honour to be good enough to have mercy on us as we have little children and a poor old mother much anxious about us TV e are oppressed and this oppression was inflicted on us without offence on our part. We now request you to be good enough to release us from the abode of disgrace and to have mercy on us. We are pre pared to comply with all the wishes of Government which they may require from us or our brother Sultan Mohsin. Should Government desire that we should place with them our second brother Husen bin Saleh, or our son as a hostage until we have complied with all conditions which Government require from us or our brother Mohsin bin Saleh excepting his coming into Aden at present on account of the fear which prevails in him, we are prepared to do so. No one will be able to make Mohsin acquiesce to the wishes of Government other than us. We will induce him by gentle words to agree to the terms which Government may require from him. If Government thinks that our guarantee for the compliance with their wishes will suffice, we are willing to bind ourselves to act up to the terms if God pleases. We request from your excellent benevolence and kindness and beseech you in the name of Him who is the Great Cause of both ourselves and you as well as your former predecessors. — - 6 to have mercy on us and release us from the prison as you are aware that there is nothing due by us. Government is aware that we are the best amongst our clan both in our behaviour with our subjects as well as in the fulfilment of our obligations. Government is drawing the time of release very long. If Gov ernment is detaining me by the order of Saleh Abdulla, the man is false and is not able to fulfil his obligations. He does not fight for the interest of his sub jects nor is he fit to enter into terms with the Great Government and you are aware of the fact of his case.
