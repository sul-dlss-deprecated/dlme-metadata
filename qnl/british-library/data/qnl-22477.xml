ENC LOSURE. PARTITION PROBLEMS OB INDIA AND PAKISTAN EXPERT COMMITTEE'S PROPOSALS New Delhi, July 30. The Government of India and the Government of Pakistan will be staffed almost solely by those who have opted to serve the two respective Dominions by the end of August, it is hoped. This is the result of the recommendations submitted by the Expert Organisation Committee set up to implement the parti tion. Other expert committees that have reported include those on controls, trade, posts and tele graphs, railways, domicile, currency, contracts and customs. V/hile minor points remain to be settled, the broad details covered by these committees have been agreed upon. Currency Question The Currency Committee has, it is understood, agreed that there will be a common currency in India and Pakistan until March 13, 1948, and uhe Reserve Bank of India will function for both the dominions. Subsequently, during the next six months currency over stamped with the words 'legal tender in Pakistan only' will be issued for the Pakistan Dominion and within this period it is hoped that these new issues will enable the withdrawal of Indian currency from the Pakistan area. During this period the Reserve Bank will deal separately with currency matters pertaining to the two Dominions. By October, 1948, Pakistan, it is expected, will have its own currency and Reserve Bank.-A.P.I. NS.POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, CONFIDENTIAL . No. C/ 943.

Description of enclosure. Name and date Subject. Reference to previous correspondence :— *Minutes of a meeting held at the Customs House at 10 A*M# on Sunday 6th June, 1948, at which the following persons were present:- Mr. C.Dalrymple Belgrave, Mr* R*M*Brown, Manager, Messrs Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co Ltd., F/Bahdur Abdul Aziz al Gosaibi, Haji Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo, Mr. Mohamad Kanoo, Haji Ahmad Fakhroo, Mr* Hussain Yateem, Haji Abdul Aziz Ali al Bassam, Mr. Dhamanmal Isardas, and Mr. Kakoomal Vallabdas. There was a discussion about the use in Bahrain of Pakistan or of Indian currency. It ms agreed that in the past the bulk of the Bahrain trade ms with India but sane considered that, in future, it ms likely that Bahrain would have more trade with Pakistan than with India. The Merchants suggested that a general meeting should be called to discuss the matter. Somewhat strong views were expressed by the Indian merchants on the one hand and the Arab merchants on the other hand. A letter from Messrs Gray, Mackenzie, and Messrs Yusuf Kanoo &amp; Co, ms then read and discussed* These two Landing Companies applied for a revision of the Landing Coy’s rates. Last June they reduced landing rates on cargo from steamers in Manama harbour by 15^. Mr. Brown stated that the Landing Coy had lost a lakh of rupees during the last 12 months and could not continue to lose money at this rate. He also informed those present that last March the Landing Coy which ms previously owned by the B.I. Coy had now been taken over by Gray Mackenzie, a smaller concern which could not afford to work at a loss. He pointed out that landing conditions were difficult and that more cargo ms being brought to Bahrain than the facilities of the port and the Landing Coy could easily cope with. The merchants complained about slowness in conveying cargo from Sitra to Manama. They said that in some cases cargo took 14 days between Sitra and Manama. They agreed that for about 8 months after the 1st June, 1947, there ms a great improvement in landing cargo, less delay and little pilfering but they were unanimous in stating that during the last 4 months conditions had become worse than before. Various cases were referred to. The merchants asked that the conditions which Gray Mackenzie had agreed to at the meeting on 1st June, 1947, should be carried out, that deli very of cargoes should be expedited, more care should be taken to prevent pil fering and that steamers with cargo for Manama should discharge at Manama. They blamed the local staff, nakhudas and boatmen, for the pilfering and said that men dismissed for dishonesty had been re-employed and that this contributed to the present state of affairs. Mr.Brown attributed much of the reason for delay to the fact that Sh.Hamed Bridge only opened once by day and once by night, he also spoke of the shortage of landing craft and the necessity of unloading egtay steamers immediately to avoid costly demurrage fees. The merchants did not agree with this argument and suggested that more local craft could be hired. Mr.Brown explained that this could only be done by raising the fees as hire of local craft was so high. The merchants referred to the meeting on 1st June 1947 when the project of a local Landing Company being formed was abandoned because, they implied, Messrs Gray Mackenzie agreed to effect improvements in their system. They contended that these improvements had been evident for 8 months but during the last four months conditions had become worse than before June 1947. Finally it was agreed that the rates on landing cargo from steamers at Manama should revert to what they were before June 1947, which was an increase of 15^o over present day rates. The possibility of Police supervision on landing craft between Sitra and Manama was discussed, the Adviser stated that the Bahrain Government did not hold itself responsible for guarding cargo in charge of the Landing Coy on the Coy’s boats but it might be possible to experiment with seme Police guards on seme of the craft.

Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian GulfPAKISTAN CURRENCY. Pakistan Notes of the denominational value of Pb. 100/-, Bs.10/-, Rs.5/-, Rs.2/- and Re.l/- were issued by the Reserve Bank of India in Pakistan on the 1st April 1948, These Notes are similar in appearance to the India Notes at present in circula tion in India and Pakistan except that they are inscribed with th&lt; words 'GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN' in English and Urdu. These Pakis tan inscribed Notes are at present circulating along with other bank notes of the Reserve Bank of India and are exchangeable at par* Issued by the same currency authority Pakistan inscribed notes ieeaed naturally have identical backing with other bank notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India. Since the issue of the Pakistan currency and even before that a class of non-muslims has been carrying on malicious propaganda not only in India but also in some Muslim countries in the Middle East with a view to sabotage and discredit Pakis tan currency. In India this propaganda completely died down immediately, the Pakistan currency was issued. An agreement has recently been concluded between the Government of India and the Government of Pakistan rupees will have the same value as the Indian rupees and the Reserve Bank of India will purchase Pakis tan rupees offered to it without limitat the agreed par value. Complaints were received from Kabul, Basra, and Iraq that Banks and people were not accepting Pakistan currency in spite of the fact that India currency was freely exchangeable in all these places. It was surprising that non-muslim malicious propaganda carried on by Hindu and Sikh businessmen in these countries should have had so much effect that the currency of Ibhe most powerful Muslim State was not finding recognition and free acceptance in other Islamic countries whereas Indian currency which had the same backing and appearance was enjoying complete exchange facilities. The Afghanistan Bank has since agreed to accept Pakistan currency but hesttance on the part of the business class s^till persists and it is necessary that that they should be aqufnted with the correct state of affairs. The strength of a currency depends ultimately on the balance of payments and the potential wealth of the country to which it belongs. It has now been universally recognized that Pakistan will enjoy a favourable balance of payments not only with India but also with other sterling and dollar areas as well. Here is an extract from a recent issue of the Indian Finance published from Calcutta. 'Fears in business circles that Pakistan currency will run at a discount over Indian currency have been greatly falsified by the very favourable 'trade Balance' built by Pakistan, during its short period of existance. During the past nine months since its inception, Pakistan has exported heavily to the extend of Es.23 crores while its import during the same period have been hardly Ps.l2-£ crores; This ie has resulted in the accumulation of over Ps. 10 crores to the credit of Pakistan in both Sterling and Dollar Blocks, and with a restrictive import policy, foreign credits promise to accumulate further. Hopes are being expressed that sooner or later, Pakistan currency will tend to delink itself from sterling and may become a hard currency itself occupying the same position as the Dollar commands today'. , Hard and undeniable facts have thus convinced the people in India of the inherent strength of currency . Jhe people in the Middle East Countries who are unaware q£ thfe'lbcal conditions seem to have been influenced by the fals*4Vid: malicious propaganda started by the Indian merchants abrdad* It ,is : therefore necessary thit wide publicity should be given to the facts of our economic mone tary conditions and people should be made to see through the evil designs of our enemies.No.C/Ij-92.

The Political Agent, Bahrain • Dear Sir, With reference to your letter No. C/L-93 of date, I have not heard of Pakiitan Currency being dlacredited in Bahrain. It !■ true that the two Banka here are exchanging them for Indian Currency at the rate of Ra*9/15/0 Indian Currency for Ra.10/- Pakiatan Currency, the diacount of 1 anna per Ra.10/- being taken to ycover the coat of repatriating the Pakistan notea. It muat be underatood that while Indian Currency ia the domestic currency, established by long usage in Bahrain and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf shaikhdoma, any other currency such as Sterling NdtCa, Iraq Dinar Notes, Egyptian pound Notes etc., and Pakistan Rupee notes are not domestic currency and are therefore exchangeable for domestic currency at rates which Cover the cost of repatriation. The poaitIon(in Iraq is similar with perhaps this exception that Indian Currency notes may command a premium with merchants owing to a demand for them for remittance (smuggled perhaps) to Kuwait for the purchase of goods there, Indian Currency being the domestic currency in Kuwait* This demand would naturally not apply to Pakistan currency which would be taken at repatriation cost only and may explain the apparent tt non-recognition ,f of Pakistan Currency there. yours ^faithfully.

Difficulty in keeping accounts in two currencies and fact that Pakistan currency is only acceptea by banks at discount can be given as reasons for this.

The cost is not very much, indeed Breach, to whom I also spoke, said that even to government it would be negligible, and I do not think Cable and Wireless which is still more a com mercial firm than a government organisation can afford to turn away ft customers n merely because they happen to bring Pakistan Currency to pay for their telegrams. As far as my office goes, the Accountant tells me that » no Pakistan Currency has been tendered.

BRITISH POLITICAL AGENT BANS PAKISTAN CURRENCY IN BAHREIN DESPITE OVERWHELMING DEMAND. (from Dawn correspondent) Bahrein, Sept.2: Bahrein is a small island in the Persian Gulf with a total population of about 100,000 out of which about 300 are Jews and the rest all Muslims. There are about 20 Hindu merchants doing business here. Indian Currency was in vogue in the pre-partition days, but with the establishment of Pakistan, the latter's currency also found its way but the Eastern Bank (a Jewish concern) accepted it only at a discount because the word 'Pakistan' was overprinted on it. While this state of affairs continued, the authorities here sounded the local merchants as to whether they would prefer Pakistan currency or Indian currency to be the of ficial currency of Bahrein. All the Arabs and Persians voted for Pakistan currency. The Jews and Hindus, of course, chose the Indian currency. Despite the overwhelming demand for Pakistan cur rency, the Political Agent (a representative of the British Foreign Office) has issued the following notice:- 'Please note that transaction at office should be conducted only in Indian currency. Payment in Pakistan currency must be refused.' The British Political Agent's action is one more proof of Britain's anti-Pakistan policy.4 ^ A THE BAHHAH* CEHEBAl MERCHANTS’ ASSHClATlON BAHRAIN .

Like the previous articles this one is a string of lies. I made no effort to 'oust Pakistan Currency from Bahrain'. I do not think the rest of the article requires any comments. His Excellency Lt. Col. A.C. Galloway, CIE, QBE, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, B A H R A IN.(EDITORIAL FROM 'DA”N' of the 17th September, 1948.) SHADOWS OYER BAHRAIN. The small but important island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf has lately sprung into prominence an’ for very ^ood reasons. Iran has renewed her claim to Bahrain lilands in a Iiote to the British Government reiterating her sovereignity or~^ nnem. hub currency controversy, about which detailed reports have already appeared in our news columns, hr s brought the affairs of Bahrain into sharp focus from another angle. Bahrain, whose total area is only about £13 square miles and its population in the region cf 100,0.0 is nominally ruled over by His Highness the Shaikh, but it is do facto under British rule. The British interest lies, of course, in oil which was discovered in the island in 1932 and which is exploited exclusively by a British Company registered in Canada. Besides, strategic considerations have prompted the Brit:sh to a-d the responsibility of governing Bahrain to tC - already heavy ' Kite Ten’s burden which they carry. The controversy which has nrisen between Iran and Britain over the possess! n of t v e i* land may well bo left to take its course, and all that we would li’e to ryy is that the Anglo- American interpretation o( the Iranian ote as having been inspired by ussia ' o&gt; s *ofc les- than justice to Tran. Cf greater interest t :&gt; Pakistan is the matter of currency ^nd the general policy which is now being pursued by the British adminis trators of the island. The full facts concerning the move, with the active aid of the olitiral Agent, to oust Pakistan currency from h hr&gt;in are already novn lo our readers and it is quite obvious that the bias among the top administrative personnel there is definitely against Pakistan. The administra tion is manned very largely by Indian bind us f rort top to bottom, although the populati n is overwhelmingly Muslim. A news Agency message from Tehran revealed even greeter fac s. According to thisjbource, the Iranian Government have sent three further memoranda to the British Government 'accusing the latter of intentionally settling a Inrge number of Hindus and Buddhistsin the Muslim State of BahrainV This accusation cannot be lightly dismissed, specially as the British Government in their reply are reported to h&gt;?ve evaded the issue by savin? that 'the question of settling of Hindus an ,, Buddhists in the State was an internal affair of Bahrain' and therefore Britain could not 'interfere in the matter'. If those reports are true, it would appear that the British Government are still i' the habit, of underestimating the ooraaoncence of Orientals, “ho is fitoinp. to believe that Bahrein Is 'an independent State' in the sense that they cannot w interferu n in its effalrs, when everybody know? it is the Political Agent’s writ that rune and not that of His Highness the Shaikh? 'a* it tts Shaikh of Bahrain who issued the peremptory order on the banks and Government offices of the island not to accent Pakistan currency on any account? ' ,K e hope that the Government of Pakistan will no longer ignore these developments in the Persian Gulf which have ao dir ct a bearing on Pakistan’s interests. A considerable number o f Pakistan nationals have settled in Bahrain or sra carrying on trade and business there. The Hindu Stats of India ir. naturally and characteristically carrying its communal aggrandizement even into these Muslim territories adjoining Arabia, and equally characteristically our good friends at Whitehall are aiding and abetting that Hindu State. It is time that Pakistan did something about it.Copy of departnental letter No. D.1228- Asia/48 dated the^6th September, 1948, from the IViinistry of External Affairs and Commonv/ealth Rela tions, Government of Pakistan, Karachi, to the Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.

Dear Residency, His Highness the vShaikh of Bahrain wishes to introduce his own metal coinage from and including 8 annas downwards and proposes to make enquiries re garding the minting of the coins which would be some what of the same style used in Muscat. Before doing so he would like to ascertain where the Muscat coins are minted. fie believe that they were obtained from Bombay presumably from the former Imperial Mint and should be glad if you would let us know for the Shaikh 1 s information the correct address of the Mint in India from where (if there is no objection) the coins could be obtained. 2. He have consulted the Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran on the merits of the proposal and he has stated that there is no ob jection. He pointed out however that if a new Gulf Currency is introduced, particularly a currency based on the decimal system (as adopted recently by Aden from East Africa) the Shaikh's proposal should be considered in relation to it as it would not, as now envisaged, fit in with the currency based on the decimal system. fie should, therefore, be glad to know whether there have been any developments in the matter of a new cur rency for the Persian Gulf States. ^ Yours ever, AGENCY.

I enclose copies cf telegrams exchanged with the Foreign Office cn this subject. You have already discussed the matter with Goadby, and Dredge has also mentioned it to Grant who sees no particular objection to it provided the coins are of the same denomination as the existing Indian coinage which I gather is what is proposed. 2. I am not much in favour of the proposal myself and suggest that you should do your best to ride the Shaikh off it. If he insists on proceed ing with it we may may have to give way, but should obtain from him a guarantee that he will not interfere with the circulation of the Indian small coinage. 2. Personally, I think it preferable that he should issue his own stamps rather than his own coinage. I went into this question at Aden where the Sultan of Mukallah has his own stamps, and brought back with me a copy of the formal agreement under which he has been permitted to do this. I have sent the papers to Breach for his views and will consult you before taking any further action. C.J.

I have not yet obtained the views of the Political Agents, Bahrain and Kuwait on the report and may have further comments to make when I have done so* 2* The first two chapters of the report deal with the question of currency. I fully agree that it is desirable to replace the Indian rupee with currency under our own control. I think it will be possible to persuade the Rulers to agree to this and that though there may be some opposition amongst the merchants, it will eventually be overcome. I am more doubtful whether the Rulers will be willing to issue laws making the new currency the only legal tender in their States. There has been no legal tender in the past and it may be difficult to persuade them that one is necessary in the future. They mostly allow their subjects as much economic freedom as possible and the merchant communities are naturally opposed to all forms of economic control. Currency in the Persian Gulf is at present controlled by the banks rather than the States, as is evidenced by the fact that the Indian rupee has come to be regarded as the official currency rather than the Pakistan rupee purely because the banks refused to accept the latter except at a discount. They did this on their own account without consulting either the Rulers or this Residency. If a new currency is introduced, this will have to be done through the banks and. if necessary, they can be compelled to take such action in respect of a new currency as may be deemed proper by a King’s Regulation issued under Article 85(a) of the Bahrain Order-in-Council, 1949, and the corres ponding Article of the other Orders-in-Council. The existing banks in the Gulf States are all British com panies and subject to the Orders-in-Council. 3. I suggested to Mr. Weight that it would be convenient if a new rupee currency could be introduced into Aden and used in the Gulf because I am of the opinion that such a currency would be accepted as the natural successor of the IndiAn rupee. If we are to have a special Gulf rupee a number of difficult quemtions are likely to arise relating to its control and the design of the notes and coins. I am aware that it is proposed at present that Aden should adopt the East African shilling, the use of which here might not prove acceptable. 4. Mr. Walght has stated in paragraph V of chapter II of his report that it is significant that neither the Shaikh of Bahrain nor the Shaikh of Kuwait pressed for a currency for their own Sheikhdoms. The Shaikh of Bahrain did not raise this matter when I /took Mr. WalghtCOPY 2 . to see him, but as I have reported separately he has already proposed to issue his own small coinage and he will certainly follow this up when we discuss with him the issue of a new currency, I agree however that neither he nor any of the other Rulers is likely to press for a completely separate currency for his own State, 5. I would urge that an early decision should be reached regarding the policy to be followed regard ing currency in the Gulf in order that, if necessary, the whole matter may be discussed with the Rulers on the lines proposed at the end of chapter II of the report. The Sultan of Muscat should be included in the discussions. I consider it likely that he will concur in any reasonable change proposed provided we accept the responsibility for it and he is not called upon to issue any order himself. 6. In Chapter III of his report Mr. Tfttght discusses the utilisation of the surplus funds of the Gulf States. As his figures show, Kuwait is the only Gulf state in which this question at present calls for early action. In Bahrain unless there is a substantial increase in the royalties as a result of pending negotiations, the existing income is only just sufficient for reasonable local development and the building up of a reserve fund. Qatar will receive its first royalty not this year as stated by Mr. Waight but in 1960 and it will not reach a total of £600,000 till 1961. I agree generally with Mr. Weight*s recomm endations about the utilisation of surpluses and with his opinion that no approach to the Shaikh of Kuwait should be made on the subject until we have formed more definitive ideas on it ourselves, I, as is proposed, a Financial Secretary is appointed to my staff. I hope I may be able in due course to suggest the lines on which he should be approached, I am not at first sight in agreonent with Mr, Waight*s suggest ion that the Rulers should be pressed to increase their customs tariffs. Some of the Sheikhdoms owe their prosperity very largely to their low customs tariffs and I am doubtful if it is wise to encourage the Rulers to raise them either from a local or a general point of view. 7. I am interested to see that Mr. Waight does not support the criticisms which have been levelled at Mr. Belgrave for his conservatism during the last few years. I agree that Mr. Belgrave has been very wise to build up a reserve and have to admit that recently the progress made in local development has been substantial. I still consider that some of his methods call for criticism but not his general financial policy. 8. I am not quite sure that Mr. Waight is correct in his statement that the Shaikh of Kuwait is very much under the influence of the Kuwait Gil Company, vide para. IX of chapter III of the report and I am inclined to think that the reverse is the case, /9. In chapter3. 9* In chapter IV Mr. Weight discusses exchange control in the Persian Gulf and it is very gratifying to note that he is of opinion that the Political Resident and the Political Agents are performing their functions in this matter satisfactorily. I am also very glad to see that he appreciates the services rendered by the banks* I have had to use the managers of the banks, particularly Mr. Grant of the Eastern Bank, as my financial advisers and I have always found them most impartial in the advice they have jjlven me and most co-operative in every way. 10. I am rather surprised to learn of the manner in which the customs dues at Kuwait are divided, vide the footnote to paragraph 111(a) of Chapter IV, and am taking steps to verify Mr. Weight’s information. 11* I agree with what Mr. Weight has to say about the Arabian American Oil Company’s request for conversion of their rupee balance with the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, the T.W.A. rupee balance and dollar accounts. With regard to the second of these items, the latest develop ment is that T.W.A. have applied for a sterling remitt ance against their rupee balance here to the Irish Republic to enable them to meet their expenses at Shannon Airport. This means they will be able to avoid the necessity of using convertible sterling standing to their credit in the United Kingdom for meeting these expenses. Although in the long run this amounts to the same thing as permitting them to convert their rupee balance into dollars here, it is difficult to see how this request can be refused. I am reporting this matter separately. 12. Mr. Weight’s suggestion in his remarks regarding the repatriation of rupee notes to India and Pakistan and gold transactions, that India should be encouraged to refuse large repatriations of notes from the Gulf causes me some anxiety as if it is adopted it might lead to a substantial depreciation in the value of the Indian rupee locally. 13. In chapter V Mr. Weight discusses miscellaneous items. I fully agree with what he says about Pakistan currency and would only add that after I had replied to the Pakistan Government warmly welcoming their proposal to send a representative of the State Bank of Pakistan for discussions I heard from them that the visit had been cancelled. The appointment of a Financial-Commercial Secretary to the Political Resident has I understand been accepted by you in principle and Treasury sanction has been applied for. In the circumstances, no further discussion of this proposal is required. I am not quite sure, however, that I told Mr. Waight that I was of the opinion that the tendering of advice to the Shaikh of Kuwait by a Financial Secretary to this Residency would have very nearly the same result as the appointment of a whole-time financial adviser. The latter, if he were permitted to function properly and his advice were accepted, would play a much more active part in local development than a Financial Secretary to the Political Resident. I hope, however, that the Secretary when he has had some experience may be able to obtain the Shaikh’s confidence and persuade him to accept his advice to some extent regarding investments and expenditure and that in due course he may be able to induce him to employ some kind of British Financial expert. /With regard4. With regard to the Bahrain reserve fund Mr* Beigrave has informed us that he has written to the Reserve Bank of India asking for permission to se/^ll securities to the extent of Rs.61,64,100 (or about £467,102) for development purposes. 14. I am grateful to Mr. Weight for calling attention to our staff difficulties here. You are yourself, Sir, fully aware of these and action is now being taken to meet some of our requirements. I would, however, strongly urge that we should be prov ided with one or two officers in addition to our‘ ordinary establishment in order to create a leave reserve. Owing to the nature of the climate officers ought to be allowed to take leave as frequently as possible and are often compelled to go on leave at short notice on account of ill health. We have to man a number of scattered posts, some of which cannot be left untenanted. In present circumstances, if a casualty occurs it usually means that either the Political Resident or the Political Agent, Bahrain, is left without any officer to assist him. 15. I am most grateful to Mr. Waight for devoting so much time to us and for his valuable report, and hope that he will pay us another visit in the near future and that his next tour will include Qatar, the Trucial Coast and Muscat. 16. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Head of the British Middle East Office. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most humble obedient Servant, The Rt. Hon. Ernest Bevin, M.P., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office, London^a. Confidential . S.O.No.C/R-297. Dear Sir Rupert, Your confidential No.65/152/49 of July 4. 4 * c 2. I return herewith Weight*s report which I have read with the greatest interest. 3. The only points that occur to me are very minor ones. 4. I do not see that we should perpetuate the name 'rupee” which is not Arabic. Why not 'rial'? 5. I notice it is proposed to divide the new coin into 100 parts. The present rupee is divisible into 192 parts although I understand that they are not all in effective circulation. In Bahrain the pice is the smallest coin in use and that is a 64th part of the present rupee. In the new currency the nearest equi valent coin would be a 50th part of the new unit which in terms of commodities means an increase in price. I mention this because I believe that when the East African shilling was introduced into East Africa it abolished much small currency, boosted the cost of ar ticles at the lower end of the currency range and so bore harshly on the very poor. If there were any danger of a similar tendency in the Gulf it might be overcome by fixing the new unit at 9d. instead of ls.6d. and thus of/ making the 'pie' a 200th part of the 'rupee' instead a 192nd part as at present. This question of the pie may not arise in areas under development where the cost of living is high but it may weigh considerably in undeveloped areas where the standard of living is extremely low. If the new cur rency is to be widespread it should be designed to cover varying standards of living. 6. I should like, If I may, to support your suggestion to include Aden in the new currency. Waight refers to the extremely bad surface communications between Aden and the Gulf States. Bad communications do not prevent Dhofar from being more Muscat than Muscat, and Dhofar adjoins the Aden Protectorate. Oil developments may change the face of these countries almost from one day to the next (as in the case of Kuwait) so that the temporary disability of bad surface communications should surely not weigh in deciding a currency policy that is to provide for the un limited future. Also from a political point of view Aden should properly be linked (through its Eastern Protectorate) with Dhofar, Muscat and the Gulf rather than with East Africa. 7. I concur that it is most desirable to retain the King*s head on the new currency both because it would breed confidence His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. Political Agency, Bahrain, July 14, 1949.confidence in the new money and also for political reasons but suggest it would be easier to introduce such new coins into the Gulf if it could be represented to the local rulers that the best solution of currency problems lay in the substitution of Aden for Indian cur rency. (The King’s head could automatically appear on the Aden currency.) 8 . The Maria Theresa dollar, which has a sentimental as well as an intrinsic value, circulates in the Trucial Sheikhdoms where, among the tribes, it tends to drive the rupee out. I presume however that its retention results from the present undeveloped nature of these territories and that with commercial expansion it would retire farther and farther into the interior.

We invited the comments of Commonwealth Relations Office, the Treasury, and the Bank of England, but the general view is not unnaturally that Pakistan's decision not to devalue has changed the position radically and there is no information here on the situation which has developed as a result of it. We shall therefore be glad to have a report on the effect of Pakistan's decision on the currency and commercial position in the Gulf. 3. I enclose, however, a copy.of a letter from Tims of the Commonwealth Relations Office about one matter mentioned in your despatch - the finding of an outlet for Pakistan rupees. We understand the Ministry of Food are no longer concerned with the supply of cereals to the Gulf since the pool has been found uneconomic due to the Gulf States fending for themselves. Perhaps the Gulf States or their merchants might themselves explore the possibilities of trade with Pakistan and we would welcome your views on how far we might encourage them to do so. 28th November, 1949, 1 Yours sincerely, ( Signed) TOM nOGEitS Lieutenant Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E. , C.S.l. Bahrein.1(0 v \ COPY E.1^066/49 COMkOKWi^LTH DELATION 6 OFFICE, DOWNING STREET. 20th October, 1949. /V Dear Rogers, I promised to let you have our comments on paragraph 4 of Hay f s Despatch of the 2nd September about his conversation with Mr. S. Ahmed, of the State Bank of Pakistan. Ahmed was concerned at the way in which .Pakistani rupees tended to accumulate in Bahrein and, in order to iind an outlet for them, suggested Pakistan might be able to export certain commodities to the Persian Gulf. We have looked into the supply position of the commodities he mentioned. There is no chance of any exports of rice, but there might be about 59 ,QUO tons of wheat available. At present this is being held as a reserve. Of the non-food items there could only be very small quantities of sanitary fittings, electric bulbs and cotton twist available. Pakistan does produce cotton twist and yarn, but she had to import 60 million lbs. last year. Cement is more hopeful. There should be a lair amount of cement available for export. I do not suppose Ahmed knew much about what Pakistan could supply and was thinking rather of the things the Shaikhdoms wanted. Perhaps Pakistani decision not to devalue has made her rupees unpopular in the Gulf, thus applying a check to their further accumulation. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) B.D. Tims, T.E. Rogers, Esq., Foreign Office,COi.l I^TIaL 19747/49 The Persien Gulf Residency, Bahrain. 17th December, 1949* It will tike me some time to obtain reports from the political Agents on your letter B. 10953/ 1115/91 of the 26 th November in which you asked me for a report on the effect of Pakistan's decision not to uevalue their rupee on the currency and commercial position in the Gulf, and for my views on how far we mi&amp;ht encourage the Gulf States or their merchants to explore the possibilities of trade with Pakistan. I will however let you have at once such infoi-mation as is available to me. 2. for some time after the revaluation of sterling the banks purchased Pakistani rupees at the rate of about Rs.Indian 141 to ns. Pakistani 100 and forwarded the notes to Karachi where they were allowed sterling in exchange for them. Recently, however, the Pakistan State Bank refused to exchange any more Pakistani notes for sterling and since then the Gulf banxs are accepting no Pakistani rupees. as a result the bazaar rate in Bahrain has dropped to about Rs. Indian 125 to Rs. Pakistani 100. I am told that Pakistani rupees as they become available are being exported from Bahrain to the mainland and sold by Saudi merchants at Jeddah who are interested in exchange operations at the rate of dials 118 to Rs. Pakistan 100 which is the equivalent of Rs. Indian 132 to rs. Pakistani 100. 3. The failure of Pakistan to devalue their rupee has really only affected Pakistanis living in the Gulf Btates who have to make remittances to their homes. The legitimate trade of the Gulf States with Pakistan has always been very small and has now come practically to a stand-still. I am doubtful if there is much point in encouraging the Gulf States or their merchants to explore the possibilities of trade with Pakistan. Generally speaking, the merchants are well informad and possess plenty of acumen and they will require no encouragement if there is any profit to bu made from such trade. Recently the Pakistan Government offereu us a certain amount of rice ana we accepted some for Gwadur but the order was cancelled a few days ago. I am asking the Political Agents to inform tne states that wheat is available in Pakistan, but tuey are at present obtain ing their requirements from Iraq, Persia ana elsewhere and 1 am doubtful if they will be anxious to obtain any from Pakistan, especially as in view of the present rate of the Pakistani Rupee, it is likely to be more expensive than wneat irom other sources.

M.B.EII, B, IPs Political Agent, Bahrain, Dear Sir, Re mutilated Reserve Bank of India Notes We enclose a extract from the Reserve Ban!: of India (Note Refund) Rules of March 1935 relative to payment of mutilated notes. It appears to us that these rules are being enforced in many cases where no time justification exists. As you are aware it is the custom for holders of notes to fold them, often twice, and that after considerable use the note becomes fragile and is easily tom. In such cases the holder attaches the 2, 3 or 4 pieces together with some adhesive substance and returns the note to circulation. In order to keep the note circulation in good condition, we have in the last few months repatriated to India many of these tom and mended notes, but find that the Reserve Bank of India, are refusing to pay large numbers of them invoking Rule 2 (e) and 3, As you will appreciate rigid adherence to these rules invalidates any note which has been divided and subsequently joined, and since under Rule 17, the note is retained by the Reserve Bank of India, no appeal against the decision can be made. We shall be grateful if you will point out to the Authorities in India, that the undue enforcement of these rules may make the Rs.lO/- note unusable in the Gulf.Area.

After Weight had trade his report last year, we had proposed that the position in regard to Persian Gulf currency should be fully explained to the Government of India in the hopes of inducing then to recognise that a change was necessary and to cooperate in its execution. Other Departments in London, however, considered that such a course would have no chance of success and ftlght indeed have the effect of stiffening the attitude which the Government of India had already taken up in regard to the proposed change of currency in Aden. A further suggestion on our part that the Government of India should be approached directly after the Aden question had been settled was likewise regarded as impracticable. It was accordingly decided, at an Inter departmental meeting on 24th April, that the approach to the Government of India on the Aden question should be made independently but that our right to take up later the question of the withdrawal of the Indian rupee from the Gulf should be reserved. It was agreed that we should also seek your views on the actual currency position in the Gulf. ^ rtc** 3. After receiving Pelly's letter No. 44/25/500 of 14th August, we re-considered the position. We recognised the strength of the case for making a change in the Gulf currency, and our responsibility in the matter. On the other hand, there appeared to us to be formidable objections to linking the question specifically with that of Aden, or even to taking it up before the latter was settled. These may be summarised as foilowe;- (a) The need for a change in Aden was clearly urgent, but the attitude previously adopted by the Government of India on the question suggested that their cooperation was already going to be sufficiently hard to obtain. To link the Gulf currency question to it would certainly have increased the Government of India’s opposition, and might well have prejudiced the Aden case. (b) Our right to make the change in Aden, which is a Colony, is unassailable. To make a similar change in the Gulf, particularly if it involved introducing a currency bearing the King's Head, might well raise constitutional difficulties. Failing India's cooperation, it would moreover involve considerable practical difficulties which might in fact be impossible to overcome. /(e) In CONFIDENTIAL Lieutenant Colonal Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.K., C.S.I., Bahrain.(c) In Aden the initiative for asking for a change had been taken by the local population, who were strongly pressing their de ands. No such spontaneous desire for a change had been manifested in the Gulf; while this might be because the question had (perhaps unfortunately) been raised on our side, the fact that the local rulers and populations were apparently content to leave the matter to our decision, suggested that they should be prepared to abide by that decision whatever it was* 4* In these circumstances we decided not to insist with the other Departments concerned on linking the Gulf currency and Aden currency questions, a course to which, as explained above, they were strongly opposed. We accordingly concurred in the terms of a saving telegram to the United Kingdom High Commissioner in New Delhi, a copy of which I enclose. As you will see, paragraph 8 of this telegram reserves our position in regard to the Gulf currency. 5. We also took up with the Corrimonwealth Relations Office the question of a possible devaluation of the Indian Rupee in the light of the report of the Indian Fiscal Commission. They considered devaluation to be unlikely, and I enclose a copy of a letter on the subject from the United Kingdom Trade Commissioner in New Delhi. We have also communicated to the other Departments concerned the other information contained in Bahrain telegram No. 329 of 23rd September. 6. This is how the matter stands at present, and we will keep you informed of any developments. We should therefore prefer that this question should not now be raised with the Rulers, or with anyone else, in the Gulf. If, however, it is found necessary to reply to enquiries on the subject, e.g. from Belgrave, we suggest that you might take the line that His Majesty's Government, while fully aware of their responsibilities in the matter, have decided that the political and technical complications of a change in the Persian Gulf make it impracticable to envisage such a change for the present, though the matter is being kept under review. 7. Finally, we shall of course wish you to report any further developments in the Gulf which might bear on the question. This is all the more necessary, since we shall wish to review the question in due course, particularly if there were any great delay in implementing a proposed change of currency in Aden. 8. I am sending copies of this letter to Tims of the Coranonwealth Relations Office, Young of the Treasury, Hulland of the Colonial Office and Loombe of the Bank of England. (G.W. Furlonge)/124 ) OUTWARD SAVING TELEGRAM FROM COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICE (BY AIR MAIL) ECONOMIC ( I II) DEPARTMENT E( B)102 2 /1 TO.: U. K. HIGH COMMISSIONER IN INDIA (DATED 13th October,, 1950) No.476 SAVING CONFIDENTIAL ' Your telegram No *468 of 9th February. ADEN CURRENCY It is felt here unless discussions are to go on indefinitely on this subject* which we hope to avoid* we must take a definite line based on the viev/ that the balance of argument is in favour of the change* which we in any case feel, to be in the best interests of Aden on whose behalf it is to be made. We are not satisfied that there is any real force in the arguments which the Indians have advanced concerning the reflection of the move on confidence in the Indian rupee. We believe the effect is likely to be negligible and certainly not sufficient to justify us in withholding support from a change which is clearly in the ultimate interests of the' Colony. As far as the Indo-Pakistan dispute is concerned the fear expressed in Aden is that the outcome may be not a lower, but a higher, sterling value for'the Indian rupee* The original aide memoire on which the discussions on this matter have been based was an intimation of what was intended to be done. It was unfortunate that the contents of that aide memoire were not perhaps as fully explanatory as they might have been. It is now suggested that the position be set out once more giving as a reply to the Ministry of External Affairs 1 letter of 29th December a restatement of the intentions in this matter with the further explanatory material mentioned below to show why this decision has been come to and should be carried out. L * It is not intended to dispute the historical outline contained in paragraphs 3 to 7 of the Ministry f s letter though we should, if discussing this history, lay a somewhat different emphasis on its significance. The whole point of the suggestion that there should now be a change lies in the fact that the historical link whether we like it or not has been broken. Circumstances have arisen in the past and may conceivably arise in the future in which an alteration of parity between sterling and the rupee may prove desirable. India is under no obligation to consult the United Kingdom Government and would in practice be very unlikely to inform us more than a few days before acting, and it is important that we who are responsible for the financial and economic affairs of the Colony should be in a position not only to decide whether the currency of Aden should follow the rupee but also to make our decision effective at short notice. If the currency of Aden is linked to sterling either separately or together with' that of the other colonies served by the East African Currency Board an alteration in the rate on which that link operates can be made within ?4 hours of the taking of a decision* If Aden continues to use the /indian— 2 - IiTdian rupee it would 'be a matter of months to implement any decision other than that Aden should follow India* 3# It will probably be better not to deal in writing with two other methods by which, in theory, this difficulty could be resolved; and they are only mentioned here in order that you may be in a position to dismiss them promptly by word of mouth, in the improbable event that they might be mentioned as alternatives by the Indians* One is that we should permanently keep another currency in store at Aden which could be put into circulation at short notice if (a) India changed her parity, and (b) it were to be decided that Aden currency should not follow the Indian rupee# The practical objections to this are of course overwhelming* The other is that Aden should have a new currency linked, not to sterling but to the rupee, so that the parity of the link could be changed in the circumstances which we are considering* This also needs only to be mentioned to be dismissed: the practical and administrative objections are little, if at all) less than those attending the former alternative; and it could be pointed out, without unduly insisting that the Indian rupee is not a ’‘metropolitan' currency, that there is no instance of another currency being linked to the rupee otherwise than at par* 4* It is important to dispel any impression that the economy o^~- Aden is more closely'd ependont upon its connections with India than in fact it is* While it is true that Indian trade forms an important element in Aden T s commerce and that Indian Nationals form a large section of the commercial community there, the trade with India amounted to no more than 10% of Aden’s total export and import trade before the War. The percentage in 194.8 (the last full year for v/hich information is readily available) was a great deal smaller* Since these percentages are inclusive of Pakistan trade, it will readily be seen that the best overall interests of Aden do not on this ground alone depend on its commercial relationship with India* A table showing the trade figures for the above two years is appended as paragraph 12* ' ‘’ 5* At the same time we should not, of course, wish it to be thought that we consider this relationship unimportant* On the contrary the traditional relationship is well worth preserving even on the most materialistic grounds, but we cannot accept the implication of paragraph 8 of the Ministry’s letter that Indian Nationals in Aden, whose prosperity like that of all other residents is based on the prosperity of the Colony as a whole, are particularly and adversely affected by:the proposed change* 8 . It is important also to bear in mind that the switch over to a sterling currency is an Aden proposal not a piece of paternal interference by the United Kingdom Government designed to benefit the United Kingdom# , The Government of Aden itself initiated discussions on the subject when, by amending Sections 40 and 41 of the Reserve Bank of India Act in 1947&gt; Ind.ia ceased to loe on a sterling standard, and the expectation that action of the kind now envisaged would be taken has been general in the Colony for two years* The position has now been reached where considerable dissatisfaction is being expressed publicly at the long delay which has already occurred* There lias been at least one recent resolution by the Aden Chamber of Commerce requesting that the proposal be given effect to in the near future and the Governor has stated in a very recent despatch that there is ’’strong criticism by the mercantile community of Aden on the inability (sic*) of H.M*G* to implement the agreed policy of currency change”. The Indians should, therefore, not be left free to use unsupported argument basjed on any assumption that Aden itself does not strongly favour the change* Our information indeed is that uncertainty in Aden over the outcome of the Indo*-Pakistan dispute has led to even greater interest than formerly about Aden’s currency. Should there in the event be an alteration of the Indian rupee exchange, in /respectSv © -3- respect of which fears have 'been expressed locally, hoth the Go ^ r S me P, t ^^ eri United Kingdom Government would he justifiably subject to very s.trong criticism on account of the delay m bringing about the change. ' ^ J* # ohbse circumstances we are unable to see our way to dropping the proposal as suggested in paragraph 12 of the Ministry s letter# We have taken very careful account of the anxiety expressed by the Indians but have come' to the considered opinion that the effect of the new measure on confidence in the Indian rupee would not be substantial and would not outweigh its od vious benefits to Aden# ° ' J * Taking all the foregoing together, it is hoped that the cnticism,^contained in paragraph 10 of the Ministry’s letter, tnat the aide memoire does not put forward sufficient reasons and ‘ elucidation, can be answered; and that the fears expressed in paragraph 11 can be reduced to more reasonable proportions. With regard go the reference to possible repercussions in the Gulf, contained in_paragraph 9, the position here seems to be that so ar as Aden is concerned, on whose behalf the whole exercise has been considered, the interests of the Gulf are irrelevant# So iar as the United Kingdom Government is concerned the question of G i^ 1 f^ currcnci 2 s ., is one which should be considered on its own merits# -ther or not there should be any change there cannot in any circumstances be influenced by any steps taken in respect of Aden# ikere is practically no geographical or commercial connection between the two areas and we cannot feel that the interests of Aden should be prejudiced by reference to the question of the Persian Gulf winch will if necessary be persued separately. som e importance to -keep in mind-the fact that bomaliland is also concerned in the proposed operation. The situation which has‘arisen there since decisions v/ere first made illustrates further how^undesirable the- present state of indecision iu#^ n this icrritory it happens that both the rupee and the East s i lllllI ?g are concurrently'legar'tender. On purely administrative gn&gt;un s alone it is clearly undesirable to continue concurrently the legal tender basis of two currencies which in theory are liable oo move independently of each other. In this case there‘would clearly be no^ question of removing the legal tender status of the Tiast African o illing# Moreover, in anticipation of a completion of the operation conjointly with xden, the authorities have been progressively withdrawing rupees over the last eighteen months and issuing East Afncan currency with the object of facilitating the administrative cnange when it takes place in due course# Such preliminary action io,^\,e conoidcr, well advised^ in an undeveloped Territory whoso administrative facilities are, distinctly limited# Because Aden is the channel through which Somaliland’s external trade passes, and because the rupees withdrawn from circulation will have to be repatriated through Aden, it is desirable fof the two territories to act conjointly# 10# x T ! le outstarid i n g question therefore is when effect should be given to the change# The Indians desire for further opportunity for consultation oefore steps to implement the x^roposals are taken is only likely uo lead to further delay# As the discussion of the matter has already been prolonged and there is little likelihood of importsint new arguments against the opporation being produced we think it would be sufficient to fix a definite date leaving sufficient time for any incidental arrangements with the Indians to be allowed for* After explaining the reasons for this decision please inform the Government of India uhat the porposed currency change for Aden and Somaliland will take place on or about 1st April 19. r 31« You should add that we assume India will accept repatriation of rupees withdrawn as a result of the operation. 11 . For your own information we should be prepared to consider /a further1* COPY ' Our Ref. 1067 (939 ) Your Ref. Efb) 12809/4 3 Board of Trade, United Kingdom Trade Commissioner Service Eastern House, Man Singh Road, NEW DELHI. 27th October, 1950 CONFIDENTIAL Dear Snelling, Owen T s temporary absence in Bombay, I am replying to your letter of the 16th October (reference as above). 2. I know of no evidence here to suggest in any way that the devaluation of the Indian rupee is at all likely (I am glad to note that you feel the same in London). I have discussed your letter with Curran who confirms that in his view the suggestion need not be taken seriously. Indeed, if any movement of the Indian rupee were likely, it would more probably be in the other direction (i.e. upward revaluation) lor there have from time to time been suggestions in the Pie.., ana elsewhere, that since the devaluation of the Indian rupee concurrently with sterling iast year, India is not reaping the full benefit oi the current-high prices for her raw materials and other exports, including cotton and jute goods. Behind all criticism that the Pakistan rupee is over-valued, there lurks now and then the leeling that Pakistan is cashing in on the high orices caused by the world demand for raw materials (e.g. cotton) and this feeling is tinged with faint regret that India is not doing the same. 3* I would not suggest that you take this suggestion of upward revaluation seriously; I only introduce it in order to show that any downv/ard movement of the Indian rupee seems most unlikely. You have referred to references to devaluation on pages 140 and 336 of the Report of the Fiscal Commission. The first of these references will be found in paragraphs 141 and 142 of the Report. From the v/ording of the first sentence in paragrajjh 142 , I w r ould suggest that the references to devaluation in paragraph 141 are purely general and refer to theoretical considerations to be borne in mind by any country in balancing its foreign trade. Paragraph 142 then refers specifically to India's own policy, but I think that the sentence at the top of page 141 is significant here. This sentence reads 'In retrospect the economic benefits of devaluation appear to us to have been primarily of a defensive or safeguarding character. That is no small gain in a fluctuating world where about a year ago India's external economy seemed to be precariously balanced'. In the light of this sentence, I do not think we should read into paragraph 142 any inference that any further devaluation is intended. 4« As far as the references on page 336 are concerned, since these merely contain in summary form the substance of the earlier paragraihs 141 and 142 , there is no reason to draw any other inference here either. Yours sincerely, (£gd.) J. N. McKelvie United Kingd om Trade Commissioner A. W. Snelling, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, LC NDON. S.W.l .Confidential. Political Agency, No.C/R-668. Bahrain, 30th December, 1950. Dear Sir Rupert, With reference to,*fhe enclosure to your compli mentary slip No.44/33/50G of the 29th December, I only wish to say here that I find it difficult to appreciate the arguments for not changing the Gulf currency which are given at paragraph 3 of Furlonge's letter. As for (a) the question of urgency here must largely be a matter of opinion; but it is difficult not to have misgivings at the postponement of* a measure which would relieve us of anxiety as to future of the currency used in the Gulf. We cannot be wrong if we change and we may easily be wrong if we do not. As to (b), surely our right to make a change in the Gulf is also unassailable? As to (c) the demand has not been made / because the bulk of people here im plicitly trust us, because (as the paragraph suggests) our raising of the question implied that we were taking care of it, and probably also because people here are not used to and in some cases have not the means of being articulate in such matters. If the argument at the end of this paragraph means that the local people and Rulers are not going to blame us if we make a decision which prejudices them financially, then it is incorrect. Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.(?*■ K&gt;/ INDIA OFFICE RECORDS MICROFILM</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001e9_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/378</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001e9</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/378</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 9/34 Currency in Arab Shaikhdoms'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1947/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-06-04T00:12:24</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (135 folios)</extent><extent>The papers in the file are arranged chronologically.
