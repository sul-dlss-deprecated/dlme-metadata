Accorao-ut, to b^e rules, the old Higher Standard lest in i^r^oic cuuuoc we considered as equivalent to tne new Interpreuersai^ test. It is equivalent onjty to the Preliminary Test. I am not sure either whether any language reward was paid to you for passing the examination you quoted. I regret the delay in replying to your note out this is due to ray having to search files for precedents and/or rules. 4 i ♦ c U &amp; t—</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000c1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1458</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000c1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1458</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 15/16-I Languages – Oriental Examinations and Allowances’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1904/1944</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-08-29T00:13:04</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (301 folios)</extent><extent>File papers are arranged chronologically and usually according to the date they were circulated to the Political Agent, Bahrain and others.
