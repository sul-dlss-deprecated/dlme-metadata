Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 155.) Sir, Foreign Office, June 6, 1910. ON the 19th May the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs called upon me and had a long conversation with Sir C. Hardinge and myself in regard to the Bagdad Railway. ~ * Rifaat Pasha introduced the subject by referring to the instructions contained in my despatch No. 107 of the 20th April ; and I explained to his Excellency that it would be ^impossible for His Majesty’s Government to agree to the proposed increase of the Turkish customs duties from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent., and that I should even be reproached if I were to consent to the prolongation of the existing 3 per cent, increase after 1914, if Turkish revenues were to be pledged for the construction of the Bagdad Railway, the increases in the customs duties being thus used, either directly or indirectly, to create a monopoly which would destroy that part of British trade which had so long been established in Mesopotamia. His Excellency pointed out the difficulty winch Turkey would have in granting a concession for any railway which would become a rival of part of the Bagdad Railway, and so make heavier the burden of kilometric guarantees to wdiich Turkey was pledged in connection with that railway: the greater the competition which the Bagdad Railway had to meet, the greater the burden would be. Finally, Rifaat Pasha suggested that Turkey might induce Germany to give up the Bagdad-Gulf sections of the concession, and let Turkey make that part of the line herself, and he enquired whether such a solution would satisfy His Majesty’s Government. I replied that it would be a necessary condition that if Turkey in making the railway employed foreign capital or material, a proportion of, say, GO per cent, should be British; also, if a foreign contractor were employed, he should be British. Sir C. Hardinge and I expressed doubts as to whether Germany would be willing to agree to an arrangement of this sort, but Rifaat Pasha seemed hopeful, and was anxious to try. We explained to his Excellency that we had thought it very unfortunate that Turkish revenues should have been pledged for four sections of the Bagdad Railway just before the end of the old regime ; but we had not made this a fatal objection to an increase of the customs, because the new regime could not be held responsible for it; now, however, when the new regime was endeavouring to find revenues, and to pledge them for four additional sections, the situation with regard to the 4 per cent, increase of the customs duties would become intolerable, unless some arrangement satisfactory to Flis Majesty’s Government and British interests could be made. I have to instruct your Excellency to press the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs for a written reply to my despatch of the 20th April, setting forth his reasons for being unable to grant a concession for a railway along the Tigris Valley, and what his counter-suggestion is, as stated in conversation with me already. I may add, for your Excellency’s information, that Rifaat Pasha had an interview with Mr. Mallet on the 23rd May, when his Excellency said that the Ottoman Government were not prepared to “ froisser ” the Germans by giving a concession to a British company—an argument which is not very convincing—and that if such a concession were granted the German Government on their part would certainly refuse their consent to the proposed 4 per cent, customs increase. Furthermore, his Excellency contended that if they gave a concession to a British company in return for British assent to the 4 per cent, increase, they w&lt;mid likewise have to give a concession in return for French consent, but that the Ottoman Government did not intend to give a concession for the Homs-Bagdad Railway, which the French Government desired, since such a line would compete with the Bagdad Railway, and the burden of the financial guarantee which was an obligation upon the Ottoman Government in respect of the latter undertaking would be of longer duration in consequence of such competition.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 255, Confidential, of the 30th nltimo, I have the honour to state that the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day again spoke to me regarding the method to be adopted in conducting negotiations with Germany regarding Persia. His Excellency now stated that he had been thinking of the advisability of informing Germany that the two Powers would not negotiate about Persia otherwise than jointly. He thought that any kind of procedure by which we kept in touch with one another while negotiating separately would be excessively complicated and less certain in its results than the course which he now suggested. He remarked that he was not certain whether His Majesty’s Government wished for such negotiations d trois. I said His Majesty’s Government would certainly prefer such negotiations, the only question was whether, if Germany absolutely declined to negotiate in this way, it would be well for the two Powers to insist, with the result that there would be no negotiations at all. I also took the opportunity of reminding his Excellency of what you had said to tlje German charge d’affaires on the 1st April regarding separate negotiations on the Bagdad Railway question, as recorded in your telegram No. 156, of which a paraphrase was communicated to his Excellency by Sir A. Nicolson. Although the statement made by you as to the possibility of separate negotiations regarding the Bagdad Railway would not make it impossible to refuse separate negotiations regarding Persia, it occurs to me that the two questions are so closely connected that it might be difficult to treat them differently. M. Isvolsky stated that he thought there would be no harm in making an intimation to Germany in the sense indicated. If she declined joint negotiations we could then consider how to proceed. We should at any rate have shown the German Government that the two Powers were not to be separated. In conclusion his Excellency said that he would draw up a form of communication to the German Government which he would submit to you. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE.

Sir, Foreign Office, May 31, 1910. COUNT METTERNICH came to inform me to-day that he was going to Berlin for some days, and after some general conversation he asked me whether I had anything to say to him before he went upon the subjects which had recently been under discussion between ourselves and Germany. I replied that I had nothing new to tell him about Persia. Within the last ten days we had made at Tehran the communication which, as I had previously told him, contained the least that we could say. I repeated the substance of it, and added that as we had not asked for a reply pledging the Persian Government to give us any monopoly, the communication was not open to the objection which the German Government had apprehended. Count Metternich said that his Government had received the same information from M. Isvolsky ; but, in order to prevent any misunderstanding arising from the reports which they received from the German Minister at Tehran, who got what information he could, Count Metternich would like to be quite sure of the dates. He understood that about a month ago we had made a written communication asking for a reply, and he seemed in doubt as to whether I was now referring to a written or a verbal communication. I informed him that the first communication was a written one on the 7th April. The Persian Government had replied satisfactorily to that on the two financial points, out had asked for an explanation of what exactly we meant with regard to concessions. We had now, within the last ten days, given this explanation in a written communication which required no reply. Count Metternich then said that he understood I had told you my views on the subjects of your conversations with the German Chancellor, and he asked whether I had written to you. I answered that I had not given you any written communication to make, but I had told you in a letter what my views were. As Count Metternich was anxious to know them, I said that I had told you how impossible it would be for me to make an arrangement about Persian railways unless an arrangement with regard to the Bagdad Railway were included. Count Metternich argued that the quid pro quo for a share in Persian railways would be the renunciation by Germany of her right to apply for railway concessions in the part of Persia in which we were interested. He could not see why the Bagdad Railway should be brought into the discussion, or why we should expect participation in it without giving some quid pro quo. I observed that financial assistance and the 4 per cent, increase of the Turkish customs dues would be a quid pro quo. I also reminded Count Metternich that on the occasion of the German Emperor’s visit it had not seemed unreasonable to the Germans, i# the conversations which then took piace, that we should have participation in the southern end of the Bagdad Railway, “ a gate ” as the Emperor had called it, without any talk of a quid pro quo other than financial assistance. Even the 4 per cent, increase of the Turkish customs, which was directly or indirectly to provide money for the Bagdad Railway, was not mooted then. Count Metternich said that he would like me to know what the attitude of the late Couservative Government had been with regard to the Bagdad Railway, as they were certainly not less Imperialist than the present Government. Lord Lansdowne had expressed himself favourable, in the interests of general commercial development and civilisation, to the making of the Bagdad Railway by Germany. All he had stipulated was that an arrangement should be made with Great Britain when a port was actually selected on the Persian Gulf, as it would prejudice our interests if a fortified harbour were constructed there. No mention had been made of British control of the line from Bagdad to the Gulf, a most valuable part of the railway. [2738 hh —2]r- Since the Emperor’s visit two years ago more political feeling had been aroused about the railway, and this had made things more difficult. I told Count Metternich that, early this year, Herr Gwinner and Sir Ernest Cassel had been in negotiation, and I had thought that the financiers would probably be f' able to come to some arrangement; but progress had been blocked by political considerations. Count Metternich did not dispute this, but rejoined that it was over here that the question had been made a political one. I observed that what I meant was that the negotiations between the financiers had been blocked by political considerations in Germany. Count Metternich explained that he meant that the political feeling in Germany had been aroused by the political considerations which had been urged here. I am, &amp;c. E.

Mr. O'Beirnc to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 6.) (No. 255. Confidential.) Sir, St. Petersburg!!, May 30, 1910. IN a conversation which I had to-day with the Minister for Foreign Affairs he referred to the negotiations which would presently take place between Russia and Germany regarding Persia and the Bagdad Railway. He observed that he had all along kept His Majesty’s Government fully informed of Germany’s proposals to enter into these negotiations. It was perfectly obvious that Germany’s intention in negotiating in the way which she had adopted, with each of the two Powers separately,, was to bring about a division between them. He had been considering what procedure we ought to* folio win order to render such a result impossible, what was the most suitable machinery (“ mecanisme ”) to set up for our negotiations ; but he had not yet been able to come to any distinct conclusion on the subject. I said, having in mind your telegram No. 156 of the 1st April to Sir A. Nicolson, that I understood it to be your opinion that since Germany would not negotiate d quatre,,we could attain practically the same result by negotiating separately and keeping one another fully acquainted with the course of our respective negotiations. I supposed that when Germany had put forward any concrete proposals we could concert between ourselves as to the line of action to be taken in regard to them. M. Isvolsky remarked that it went without saying that he would keep His Majesty’s Government informed of his negotiations, but he was not sure that this was enough to meet the requirements of the case, more especially as regards the Bagdad Railway. It seemed to him that a moment would come in the negotiations when it would be necessary to “ make reserves,” safeguarding, as I understood him to mean, the interests of the other Powers concerned. I thanked his Excellency for wRat he had said to me, and I said that I would transmit his suggestion to you, and that you would doubtless let him have your views upon it. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE. [2789/—2][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Maje sty's Government.] BAGDAD RAILWAY. 4 SECRET. [ 18026 ] No. 1. Report of Interview of Sir E. Goschen with the Chancellor on May 12.— (Received at Foreigyi Office, May 21, 1910.) THE Chancellor said that, as he presumed I was going to London for the King’s funeral, he would like to say a few words to me on the subject of Persian affairs, in order that I might be in a position to place his views before Sir Edward Grey. He said that he was much perturbed by the step England and Russia were taking at Tehran. The assurances they were demanding from the Persian Government would, when made, practically do away with the open door and render Germany’s treaty right to most-favoured-nation treatment a dead letter. The German press would at once be up in arms, and attribute Germany’s loss of this right and the “ closing of the door ” to weakness on the part of the Chancellor. He would therefore be forced to anticipate these attacks and to make representations to the Persian Government recalling to them the fact that they were bound by treaty to give Germany most favoured-nation treatment, and pointing out that Germany could not renounce that right. This step would, as a matter of fact, be repugnant to him, as it would inevitably cause a disagreeable impression both upon His Majesty’s Government and British public opinion, and render the chances of Great Britain and Germany coming to an agreement on Persian or any other matters more remote than ever. He would view such a state of things with the greatest regret, as a good understanding with England was the j corner-stone of his policy. He begged me to impress this view of the question upon j Sir Edward Grey, and beg him to do all in his power to avoid creating a situation of which the effect would most certainly be that which he had indicated and which he was most sincerely anxious to avoid. I told him I was sure he would readily understand that it would, for obvious reasons, be impossible for us to recede from the position which we had taken up at this late hour. His Excellency said he was obliged to admit that, though somewhat regretfully, but he did hope that Sir Edward Grey would see his way to coming to terms with the German Government as soon as possible with regard to some arrangement which would show that the door was not to be closed, and that German trade and capital were not to be excluded from Persia altogether—some arrangement, in fact, which he could produce to show that German interests had not been lost sight of. After some further conversation, during which he reiterated his willingness to give every assurance that the Imperial Government had no political aims, and only desired that German economic and commercial interests should receive due consideration, I observed that it was a pity that the Imperial Government had not seen its way to go a little further towards falling in with our views with regard to the Bagdad Railway. His Excellency observed that he was quite ready to do so, but that he must, as he had already told me, have a general understanding first. On that point he could not understand our attitude—did not we want an understanding ? I said that certainly we wished to be the best possible friends with Germany ; but that in the understanding he had originally proposed there were many points of difficulty. In the first place, a naval arrangement which would satisfy public opinion in England was a sine qua non. His Excellency said, very excitedly, that he had given His Majesty’s Government to understand that he was quite ready to discuss a naval arrangement and had suggested a basis, but that His Majesty’s Government had shown no inclination to discuss it, and had let the question drop out of sight. I said that there had been very good reasons why at the close of last year the discussion had had to be temporarily dropped; but that in the meantime I had often told him that any naval arrangement on the basis of the full carrying out of their naval programme would hardly satisfy the British tax payer, to whom it would mean having to find the money for fifty or sixty “ Dreadnoughts ’ by 1917. He said : “ It is your fault. Why did you begin to build ‘ Dreadnoughts ’ ? ” I replied that the form and size of the ships our naval authorities thought necessary for the maintenance of our naval efficiency was, to my mind, beside the question ; the fact remained that we did build them, and that Germany built them likewise, and in accordance with a programme which made us incur vast expenditure to maintain the [2738 1]from time to time been made to them by His Majesty before hh ^ nf Armaments ” The Chancellor replied, very testily, that that had been betore oi armaments. 1 . , • mi p nbancellor went on to say, with reference to me more than once, but only as a contingency, and not as be taken into account in negotiations. In the meantime we had to go by what hart been declared officially in the Reichstag, namely, that the programme would, and must be carried out in its entirety. The Chancellor reminded me that he had suggeste ua the rate of shipbuilding could be restricted and spread over more years. 1 agreed that that was something, but maintained that that would not affect the ultl ^ a f Finallv, after this short conversation which was degenerating into a wiangle, Excellency gave very cordial assurances of his desire to come to an understanding with us of some sort, but added that the most pressing question was that of Persia, and tor the reasons he had given me. , Subsequently I saw Herr von Schoen for a few moments, who also spoke very seriously, but very pleasantly, on the importance to both Germany and England of things not being brought to a point where the Imperial Government would be forced to step in. “ We must come to an arrangement,” he said, “ and remember that what we really require is not political influence of any sort, but merely to save our face of our public opinion.” -rr.-ii ^ I asked him what would suffice. I had heard that Herr von Kuhlmann had suggested a percentage of the material required for any concessions we might obtain and work. He made at first as if he had not heard of this suggestion, but finally said that it was far too concrete a proposal, and, moreover, would be likely to create difficulties with other Powers ; something much vaguer would suffice so long as it made it clear that German trade and capital were not to be excluded fiom Persia. I hear that the Deutsche Bank agent opened negotiations about the establishment of a German bank (for which, I believe, a concession was granted some years ago), and was successful as far as the Persian Government were concerned; but that he was told from Berlin to drop the matter for the present as the concession, if officially given, might cause complications. He is therefore coming home practically empty-handed.This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] BAGDAD RAILWAY. SECRET. £ 18846 ] No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Sir II. Babington Smith. (Confidential). Dear Sir Henry Babington Smith, Foreign Office, May 31, 1910. IN order to avoid all ambiguity, I think it may he as well that I should put on paper my views with regard to British participation in the Bagdad Railway, in the light of Dr. Gwinner’s letter of the 21st May to Sir E. Cassel. I see no objection to your negotiating with Herr Gwinner on the basis of that letter; but I think that the British share should be 55 per cent., and that we should construct the harbour at Koweit and have a large share in its subsequent control. We should decidedly prefer that the “Indian” system should be substituted for the existing arrangement of kilometric guarantees believe that the Turkish Government could hardly object to such a modification, but if they definitely express a preference for the 1903 arrangement we should, though reluctantly, agree to it. You are, however, fully aware of the drawback of the existing arrangement for the working expenses guarantee, viz., that it militates against the development of traffic, and for this reason it should, if possible, be modified. It would be well for you fo make sure that any proposals put forward by Herr Gwinner have the approval of the German Government, and you must clearly understand that we can approve no agreement definitely without consultation with the Erench and Russian Governments.

Cassel.—{Communicated by Sir H. Babington Smith, May 26.) (Translation.) (After personal expressions.) Berlin, May 21, 1910. CONCERNING onr Bagdad negotiations, yon Lave not been quite accurately informed, and the expressions of the German Government have not been quite rightly understood. It is obvious that the German Government will not consider English concurrence in the 4 per cent, increase of the Turkish customs as an equivalent for my resigning to you the control of the section from. Bagdad to the Persian Gulf. You know that we can build the Bagdad Railway without the increase of the customs duties. It is Turkey who has the principal interest in the customs increase, not Germany. Moreover, you demanded 50 per cent, of the capital for the last section, while Hilmi and Djavid had told me expressly, as I repeated to you, that we must not go beyond 50 per cent.; Hilmi, meanwhile, has fallen, and Djavid, at least for the moment, has got into a fright. The concurrence of the Young Turk Government would also not be obtainable at the present time for the arrangement discussed between us, as Hilmi would have had it. But that is not Germany’s fault. With united forces we should be able gradually to bring the Turks round to our view ; if we oppose each other, neither will get much more than he already has ; but we are, in this case, not only the compliant and friendly party, but _ also the beati possidentes. The German Government has obviously no interest m seeing merely the proclamation of an English victory. In the sense in which we discussed it, a fuendly co-operation ought of course to be announced simultaneously, and, consequently, theie should be a reciprocal granting of minor participations in the irrigation business and similar matters. It is obvious that Germany cannot concur in an English monopo y of the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris. If, however, without a monopoly, you wish to set up half-a-dozen English navigation companies for the development of' Mesopotamia, I shall be delighted. Finally, it can hardly be expected that one should come to an understanding in an affair while one finds oneself exposed to the dangei o being opposed and maligned on that very point and everywhere else. . For the rest, I take note that you formally resume your liberty. Practically this makes very little difference in the facts. That the National Bank of Turkey is joint y interested in, and co-operate with the endeavours of Mr. Ornstem and his associates was stated by Sir H. Babington Smith himself to Baron von Marschall.

I have received your despatch No. 276 of the 3rd instant, and have to observe that German Government consider paragraph 2 of Additional Convention of the 20th February, 1908, to mean that the surpluses of the debt have been assigned to the line in general—an interpretation which is quite untenable. The paragraph in question clearly refers to the preceding paragraph, respecting the decision to continue the line to El Halif only, and therefore the surpluses can only be assigned to the prolongation as far as that point. The Turkish Government had therefore every reason to delay their assent to the proposal of the railway company, and might have been expected to do so in view of the well known wishes of His Majesty’s Government on the subject. In pointing this out to Rifaat Pasha you should impress on him that there is nothing to prevent the Turkish Government from constructing other lines to the Persian Gulf and for giving concessions for such lines, and that it is therefore immaterial whether or not the German Government voluntarily abandon, without compensation, the right to build their line from Bagdad to the Gulf, which as a matter of fact there is not the slightest ground for hoping that they will do.

As I have had the honour to explain in previous reports, the Bagdad Railway will join the Mersina-Tarsus-Adana line at Yenidje, and will then run parallel with it^ to a point just beyond the station of Chakir Pasha, whence it will branch off and, running through the vineyards at the back of the town, come out on the open expanse of c * scrub ” land which lies near the dyke and the banks of the Seihun River. Here will be the main Adana station of the Bagdad line. The invitations to yesterday’s ceremony, which took place at the point where the Bagdad line is to branch off from the Mersina-Adana line, were sent out in German from the offices of the company, and signed by Mr. Winkler, the head engineer, who has just returned from Aleppo. Mr. Winkler was himself not able to be present at the opening, owing to illness, and a M. von Brem took charge of affairs. A large marquee had been erected, decorated with German and Ottoman flags, and near by was a kind of platform, similarly decorated, where the speeches were to be held. A battalion of infantry was drawn up with music and colours, and a “ general salute ” was rendered on the arrival of the vain The first speech was delivered in French by M. von Brem, who spoke about the inestimable benefits which the railway would confer on* all the subjects of the Ottoman Empire, and further stated that he and all those in his “ company ” were proud and happy in being instrumental in bringing such a happy state of affairs to pass. M. von Brem further stated that the day would come when one would be able to travel from Bagdad to Constantinople in forty-eight hours by rail. The vali also made a long speech in Turkish, in which he expressed his warmest thanks to the Bagdad Company for the benefits to Turkey and all Ottomans which would accrue from the building of the Bagdad Railway. The speech was frequently applauded, and his Excellency’s references to the Bagdad Company were always couched in the warmest languao-e After this speech, prayers were offered up by the Mufti, and some sheep were slain as a “ kourban” or sacrifice. The vali then cut up some turf with a gilded pickaxe and with a gilded shovel shovelled the earth into a wheelbarrow; this was the signal for an outburst of cheering, the soldiers presented arms and the military band played Afterwards a reception was held in the marquee, and the band played the German National Anthem. Although work on this section has now been officially commenced it is by no means' certain in which direction operations will now continue, nor does it seem that actual work from Adana towards Eregh is to be immediately undertaken It is hard to say whether the native population was much impressed by yesterday’s ceremony, but it can be said that, although there was a great crowd, there did not seem to be much enthusiasm.

Dear Mr. Barry, Foreign Office, May 17, 1910. I HAVE received your letter of the 10th May, relative to the objections to the Homs-Bagdad Railway scheme said to have been raised by the French Ambassador at Constantinople in conversation with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs. As regards the objections numbered (1), (2), and (3) in your letter, we have no reason to suppose that the information in the possession of M. Bompard is inaccurate, though we have ourselves no recent information which confirms it. We regard the project as a French one, and accordingly prefer to take no official action regarding it pending the receipt of an official intimation of the views of the 1 French Government on the subject, and, at any rate, until this is received no 1 instructions to take action can be sent to Sir G. Lowther. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. [2738 r—3]ITbis Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] BAGDAD RAILWAY. \ SECRET. [ 18147 ] No. 1.

Sir ’ r qaw vu y. a tt- • Pera ’ May 16, 1910. 1 SAW the Grand Vizier to-day, and I repeated to him the argument which I had previously urged both with his Highness and with Rifaat Pasha, to the effect that there did not appear to be in the Convention additionnelle ” of the 20th Februarv 1903 any legal obligation for the Ottoman Government to furnish revenues for the kilometric guarantees now for the^ prolongation of the line as far as Bagdad and the Gulf. !&amp; line ® s replied that he preferred postponing a discussion of the question, as he had furnished Rifaat Pasha with full instructions to talk over the matter with you m London, but he observed that, taking the original convention together with the Convention additionnelle of 1908, the obligation did exist for the Government to furnish the .required sums as guarantees. He wished to avoid any contentious discussion with His Majesty s Government on the matter, and he felt certain that an arrangement could be come to by which the Germans would voluntarily abandon tlie claim to build the Gulf section, and intimated that, if necessary,*' the Ottoman Government could always have recourse to the pretext that no funds were available for the section beyond El Hahf. This view appeared to be somewhat of a contradiction of his Highness s previous statement, but as he showed such disinclination to discuss the matter in detail before Rifaat Pasha had spoken with vou 1 thought it better not to pursue the matter further. I do not think that his Highness had at all understood that His Majestv’s Government wished to urge him to approach the German Government, but it not unnaturally appeared to him to be the best means of meeting the washes of His Majesty s Government as regards the Gulf section. I asked his Excellency whether any definite decision had been taken with regard to the t?;a c e of the line now m course of construction, which I knew was expected about this time, and his Highness replied that the decision had been adverse to the line going by Alexandretta and m favour of adhering to the old trace by Tel-Habesh Aleppo will thus not be on the main line, but on a branch.

Rifaat Pasha said ^ that this proposal required careful study, which he and his colleagues would give it. Meanwhile, he would merely observe that it was not the Ottoman Government that had urged the continuation of the line from El Halif to Bagdad; it was the attitude assumed by Great Britain in connection with the increase ^ ^ b? r ? en ^* customs dues, and the demand made from the Bagdad Company to abandon their claim to this that had led the company to negotiate with a view to obtaining guarantees for the conclusion of the Halif—Bagdad section. The Ottoman Government, his Excellency observed, were now placed in such a difficult position ™ r f^ a hy ^ per cent., that it appeared as if it would be necessary to abandon it i the 1 owers maintained their present attitude. M. Bompard had, before leaving or . ans a 1 y ew cays^ ago, repeated that the French Government asked for no conditions, but that if other Powers insisted on such France would ask for a concession for the Homs-Bagdad line. Italy had intimated that further conditions might be asked for beyond the settlement of the claims. Even the American Government had stated that their consent would depend on the Chester concession being granted, and the order for the battle-ships being given to an American firm of shipbuilders. The Minister for oreign Affairs and the Grand Vizier had been obliged to reply somewhat sharply to these latter suggestions of my American colleague. / sa ^ ^ le His Maj'esty’s Government would not for a moment believe that the Ottoman Government were oblivious of the services rendered ^ r ^ a V&gt; -i 1 ^ 111 ^ uiail g cr isis of 1908-9. Their object in negotiating with the , Railway was merely to satisfy our demands regarding the 4 per cent. Nor id the Ottoman Government entertain any suspicion regarding British designs on Mesopotamia. They were most anxious to find a way out of the difficulty without onending Germany, to whom they were morally bound for the completion of the line when funds were available. As regards the section Bagdad-Persian Gulf, it seemed to ms Excellency possible to exclude it from the domain of the Bagdad Railway Company, an perhaps the best solution would be for the Turkish Government to construct that section of the line themselves. He would not, however, offer any definite observation f 011 ^proposals of His Majesty’s Government until he had consulted his colleagues. .he Grand Vizier, whom I saw later, spoke in much the same sense, but said it was incomprehensible to him that his predecessor should have given anything in the natuie of assurances regarding a modification of the Bagdad convention, for they ound themselves confronted by the terms of the convention and by the legal obligation to continue the line to Bagdad. It was also absolutely necessary in their own interests and to justify the sacrifices they were now making for the working guarantee that the line should have its terminus at a big centre instead of stopping in mid-air, as it were, at Halif. What, owever, he was determined to endeavour to obtain from the Germans concurrently wi a py arrangement for the continuation of the line to Bagdad was an abandonment i 1 caaiin to ktdld the section Bagdad-Persian Gulf. It would no doubt be very i cu t to succeed in this, as it obviously entailed a considerable sacrifice for the I erman company, but he felt that he would be able to obtain it. His idea was that ‘ [2738 t—4]that section should he built by the Ottoman Government, if necessary with foreign capital. Beyond that he had not considered the question m detail. The specific proposal now put forward by His Majesty’s Government would have the careful attention of the Ottoman Government, and a reply would be sent m the same form m which it had been received. . , He reminded his Highness that you, Sir, had all along been placed m a somewhat diffidSIt position in having to justify to the British mercantile interests the imposition of an additional duty of 4 per cent, which would contribute to the success of a line ultimately destined to injuriously affect our commercial position m portions of the country traversed by it—an argument which was all the stronger as Great Britain was a Free Trade country which practically left all Turkish imports untaxed. His Highness specially begged that his intentions as regards inducing the German Government to abandon the Bagdad-Gulf section, as well as the British proposal now made, should be kept strictly confidential, as any suspicion of a bargain being made would militate against the success of their negotiations for obtaining the 4 per cent. r increase I have, &amp;c.

His Highness argues that^ original convention and additional convention of 1908 read together imply an obligation to find guarantees for continuation of line to Gulf, but_prefers not to discuss question here, or to reply to your despatch No. 96, Secret, until he learns result of Rifaat Pasha’s conversations with you on the subject. He, however, added that he trusted that Germans would be reasonable about waiving their rights over the Gulf section, but if they insisted on their rights to continue to the Gulf the Ottoman Government could bring pressure to bear by stating their inability to find the guarantees.

German interpretation of second paragraph of additional convention of 20th February, 1908, that debt surpluses have been assigned to Bagdad line in general and not merely to prolongation to El Halif, for which alone second and third series of loan provides, is quite untenable, since paragraph clearly refers to preceding- paragraph respecting decision to continue line to El Halif only. There was therefore every reason for the Turkish Government at any rate to delay their assent to the company’s proposal, and, in view of the well-known wishes of His Majesty’s Government on the subject, it might have been expected that they would have done so. You should point this out to Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, and also impress on his Excellency consideration that there does not appear to be slightest ground for hope that German Government will voluntarily abandon right xo construct line from Bagdad to Gulf without compensation, and that it is immaterial whether they do so or not, for, as we have already shown, there is nothing to prevent Turkey from constructing other lines to Gulf and from giving concessions for such lines.

In reply, my Russian colleague proposes to advise that we should defer action until formation of new Cabinet, and the fear of negotiation of loans or concessions with third parties, in defiance of our recent statement of policy, should be justified by its composition, we should declare to Persian Government that the joint Powers are firmly resolved to uphold the policy set forth in their joint note, and to shrink from no steps which the protection of their interests may demand in the event of Persian Government acting counter to this policy.

Mr. Winkler, the head engineer, has recently left here for Aleppo for the purpose, it is said, of conferring with Mr. Meissoner (Meissoner Pasha, late constructor of the Hedjaz line), who will be appointed head engineer of the Bagdad construction in Aleppo. Mr. Winkler is returning in two weeks, and will then continue directing affairs from the offices in Adana. Beyond the work lately commenced between Adana and Missis, and reported upon in my despatch No. 15 of the 8th April to His Majesty’s Embassy, no new portion of line construction has been undertaken, but surveying is being busily carried on in Hamidieh, and also, I hear, in Alexandretta.

Another point worthy of interest is the completion of the company’s private telegraph line (single wire) between Eregli and Adana. This line, coming right away down from Eregli and past Bozanti, meets the Mersina-Tarsus-Adana Railway at Yenedje (about half-an-hour from Adana) and then runs parallel with the wires of that company right up to Adana and finishes in the offices of the Bagdad Company.

In this letter M. Tardieu sets forth the alterations in the terms of the agreement already approved by M. Pichon, which the latter now wishes to make after his recent interview in Paris with M. Gambon. Instead of half the capital being found by the British and French financiers respectively, he now proposes that 60 per cent, should be found by the French and 40 per cent, by the English. Instead of the director-general of the Anglo-French Company being English, as previously agreed, he now desires that the director-general should be a Frenchman. Instead of the members of the “ conseil ” being half French and half English, he now proposes that five should be French and only three English. Instead of half of the material being supplied from France and half from England, he now proposes that three-fifths be supplied by France and two-fifths by England. It seems to me that the modifications proposed will make the company entirely French instead of Anglo-French. After consulting with my friends, I have come to the conclusion that it would be difficult to raise English capital for a purely French company, and that the terms now substituted by M. Pichon for those which he had already agreed, should be adopted, would practically eliminate British interests from the line. We propose, therefore, to urge M. Pichon either to restore the conditions that the director-general should be an Englishman, or to agree to divide the whole railway into two sections, the mileage of which should be as six to four, and that the longer section, which would form a junction with the Syrian railways, should be constructed entirely by the French, and the shorter section by the English, and that after completion the two sections should be worked as one railway under a joint board. If it be found impossible to arrange some such terms as these, it may well be necessary for Youssouf Said Bey to proceed with his application independently of French support. If he succeeds, and after all he will have this in his favour that he will at least have no German opposition to face, at least, if he falls in with their suggestion to take his line to Aleppo, owing to his agreement with me, a copy of which I enclose, the railway will have to be worked under British control.

No. 1. FROM a careful perusal of the terms of the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903 (of which a copy is enclosed for facility of reference), it will be observed that there is no clause which confers on the holders of the concession a monopoly of railway construction in Mesopotamia ; indeed, according to article 42, it is laid down that the land to be expropriated shall be strictly confined to the area which is necessary for the railway. Moreover, it cannot equitably be contended, apart altogether from the terms of the convention of 1903, that, because a concession for a railway has been granted to certain promoters along one specified alignment, the Ottoman Government are ipso facto debarred from granting a further concession to other parties when that concession is for a railway destined to serve another district. Such a contention, if advanced, would be utterly preposterous; and inasmuch as it is stipulated in article 34 that all disputes respecting the execution and interpretation of the convention of 1903 shall be settled in the Ottoman courts, the ultimate decision as to what the Ottoman Government may and may not do with regard to granting further concessions would rest with those courts and with no foreign Power. T-h® German Government have definitely informed His Majesty’s Government that British participation in the Bagdad Railway will not be admitted on terms which His Majesty s Government could possibly approve. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government renew the application, to which the ex-Grand Vizier acceded in principle in September last, for an entirely separate concession as indicated in the enclosed despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. The reception with which this renewed application may meet will, as stated in the despatch, affect the future relations of this country towards the Ottoman Empire. Foreign Office, April 30, 1910.

Lowther. (No. 107. Secret.) Sir, Foreign Office, April 20, 1910. IN your Excellency’s despatch No. 197 of the 2nd instant you reported that the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs, while denying that negotiations on the subject had as yet reached a binding or final conclusion, had admitted that active discussions were in progress between the Sublime Porte and the parties concerned, with a view to facilitating the ultimate prolongation of the Bagdad Railway from El Halif to Bagdad by means of the allocation of the surplus revenues of the tithes which would be available for kilometric guarantees in 1915. This information, as your Excellency is aware, has been received by His Majesty’s Government with surprise and concern: in the first place it appears to indicate a fundamental change in the attitude assumed by the Ottoman Government only a few months ago in regard to the Bagdad Railway concession of 1903,—a concession which could hardly meet with the approval, let alone the encouragement and support, of an enlightened administration under the new regime, unless and until it had undergone drastic revision and substantial modifications : in the second place it tends to confirm an impression that the Ottoman Government, by disregarding the well-known views and wishes of His Majesty’s Government, no longer recognise that community of interest which, in the critical period following upon the revolution of July 1908, induced His Majesty’s Government on their part to extend to Turkey, with no small measure of success, their whole-hearted and consistent support: while finally, it foreshadows the progress of an enterprise which, as at present controlled and unless rendered innocuous by the execution of protective and countervailing measures, is calculated to involve increasing injury to long-established British commerce in Mesopotamia, as well as to affect political issues of the greatest magnitude in the Middle East, and more especially in the Persian Gulf, where, owing to the proximity of the Indian Empire, the commercial interests of Great Britain have long been recognised as predominant to those of all other European States. It will be convenient that I should deal with these important subjects under distinct and separate headings. Firstly, as regards the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903, your Excellency was categorically informed by Hikni Pasha, in his capacity as Grand Vizier, that the Bagdad Railway would not be continued unless the terms of the concession, negotiated under the corrupt and obscurantist rule of the ex-Sultan Abdul Hamid, were first materially altered. His Majesty’s Government had cordially shared the estimate formed by Hilmi Pasha of the concession : and the failure both in 1903 and subsequently to enlist British participation in the undertaking is largely due to the recognition in this country of the onerous nature of the concession,—imposing upon Turkey burdens altogether out of proportion to the advantages it is likely to confer,—while certain pourparlers which took place in Berlin in the closing months of last year have not led to any concrete residt owing to some extent to the disinclination of the present holders of the conces sion to consider certain financial modifications advantageous to the Turkish Exchequer, which His Majesty’s Government desired to see introduced into the scheme of the concession as regards its application to the Persian Gulf section. I do not intend in the present despatch to enter upon a detailed exposure of the objections to which the terms of the convention of 1903 might reasonably be subjected, the more so since those objections are sufficiently patent from a perusal of the document in question : but I shall touch upon certain salient points which appear particularly disadvantageous to the interests of the Turkish Government and taxpayer. Under article 35 two guarantees are instituted, the one a working-expenses guarantee, the other for purposes of construction : the first is arranged upon such a scale that it directly militates against the progressive development of traffic, and therefore against the commercial success of the line; the other is calculated upon a basis so extravagant that, even if the main line alone be taken into consideration, there should [2707 u —1 ]remain at the disposal of the promoters funds exceeding by several millions of pounds the actual cost of construction, while, if the branch lines were included in the estimate, the surplus would be still higher. It is on these grounds that His Majesty’s Govern ment are unable to approve of the financial burdens underlying the Bagdad Railway concession: they consider that there would be manifest advantages in substituting a form of guarantee approximating to that adopted by the Government of India, whereby a minimum rate of interest is assured upon the capital actually employed in constructing and working a railway, and any surplus profits over and above that guaranteed minimum are equally divided between the Government and the railway company: this system is productive of economy in construction and efficiency in working, factors which are indispensable in order to secure commercial success and satisfactory results. Secondly, as regards the attitude of the Sublime Porte towards British interests, His Majesty’s Government are far from suggesting that the Ottoman Government are at liberty to disregard their contractual obligations under the Bagdad Railway Convention simply and solely because those obligations, though concluded with evident disregard of her real interests, are burdensome to Turkey; what they do take exception to is the fact that the Ottoman Government, while showing no inclination to treat on their merits the applications for concessions and trade facilities, however modest m character, from British subjects, have apparently contemplated certain financial arrangements tending to facilitate and to hasten the progress of the Bagdad Railway towards the Persian Gulf: and inasmuch as those arrangements cannot become operative until the year 1915, the solicitude of the Ottoman Government to bind themselves without further delay and to smooth the way for a monopoly of the economic exploitation of the country cannot but cause serious misgiving and some perplexity to^ those who have at heart the financial regeneration of the Ottoman Empire. His Majesty s Government, by manifestations of practical sympathy, have given tangible proof of their^ desire to contribute towards that regeneration which is the lounelation of all administrative reform ; yet it appears that the Ottoman Govermnent at a time when they are desirous, on the one hand, of raising the customs duties on foreign imports from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, are ready on the other hand to go tto 't 4 l eir v,'^ P rom °te the prosecution of an enterprise admittedly burdensome to the Turkish^ Exchequer, without so much as attempting by negotiation with the wTin” 1 ' 68 t0 ng ab ° Ut 311 alleviation of burdens which that enterprise In the face of these considerations, His Majesty’s Government are reluctantly by GreTt^Brit^nT ‘ hat ‘a 0 M Oman , G0Vernment ’ oblivious of the services rendered by Great Britain during the Near Eastern crisis of 1908-1909, are deliberately therX m underSnW tS the e Pr0greSS l° f the .

The pax Britannica which has ever since, with rare exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrangements and is the exclusive work of this country. It is owing to British enterprise, to the expenditure of British lives and money, that the Persian Gulf, not excluding the approaches to the Turkish ports of Bagdad and Bussorah, is at this moment open to the navigation of the world: indeed to these causes alone it may be said that the seaborne trade of Mesopotamia owes its very existence. The situation of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf has been well described as unique : for although she has not sought territorial acquisitions in those regions, she has for generations borne burdens there which no other nation has ever undertaken anywhere, except in the capacity of sovereign ; she has had duty thrust upon her without dominion ; she has kept the peace amongst people who are not her subjects ; has patrolled, during upwards of two centuries, waters over which she has enjoyed no formal lordship; has kept, in strange ports, an open door through which the traders of every nation might have as free access to distant markets as her own. I have dwelt at some length upon the position of Great Britain in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf because it is desirable that the Ottoman Government should be able to appreciate fully the disturbance of long-established interests which the Bagdad Railway, the most direct route between this country and the Indian Empire, is likely to entail. This will appear the more accurate when it is recalled that under the terms ^ of the concession, the promoters of that enterprise not only are entitled to establish ports at the important trade centres of Bagdad and Bussorah, but under various articles a number of minor but valuable rights are conferred upon them: exemption from customs dues for all materials, machinery, rolling-stock, iron, wood, coal imported from abroad during the period of construction, and exemption from taxation of the company’s entire property and revenue during the whole term of the concession ; mining and quarrying and forest rights within a zone of 20 kilom. on either side of the railway; the right to establish warehouses, elevators and shops; to manufacture bricks and tiles, and to make free use of any natural water powder in the vicinity of the line—all tending to confer a monopoly of the economic development of the country. It has been incumbent on His Majesty’s Government to consider most carefully in what manner they can legitimately, and with due regard to the economic and general welfare of the important Ottoman provinces concerned, prevent the establishment of such a monopoly expanding throughout the whole region of Mesopotamia ; forestall the destruction of British commercial interests which it would perforce accomplish ; maintain an open door for the trade of all nations ; and protect the larger interests in India and the Persian Gulf which the completion of the Bagdad Railway, as at present controlled, is destined to influence. They have come to the conclusion that the only course now open to them which could at the same time promote the objects in view woidd be the construction of a “ protective ” railway. I have therefore to request your Excellency to renew the application which you have already made to the Ottoman Government for a railway concession along the valley of the River Tigris : the precise course of the line would be a matter for subsequent arrangement; what His Majesty’s Government at present desire is that the Sublime Porte should accede to their application forthwith in principle; and for this object it does not appear necessary to go further than to say that the line would approximately follow the valley of the Tigris from Bagdad to Kut-el-Amara, and that from that point it would proceed in a south-easterly direction to Bussorah, and from that point to Koweit. The cost of the railway would naturally depend upon the gauge and the results of the surveys, but His Majesty’s Government would not call upon the Ottoman Government for any guarantee whatsoever, and they would be prepared to recommend a group of financiers of high standing who w'ould provide for the construction and working of the fine under a Turkish company. Such a railway, when constructed, could not be looked upon as involving any prejudice to the Bagdad Railway Company, since in the first place it would serve a region which is distant in places over 160 kilom. from that company’s proposed alignment, while in the second place its object,—an entirely legitimate one,—is to protect long-established British interests which the Bagdad Railway is calculated to displace: British trade is indeed interested in the district in question in an especial4 n degree, since the annual volume of our trade passing into Persia alone via Bussorah and the Tigris valley is estimated at 750,000L I have accordingly to request your Excellency to read this despatch, in transla tion, both to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the Grand Vizier, and to communicate a copy to them. I desire your Excellency at the same time to press them to give an early and favourable reply to the application of His Majesty’s Government, with facilities for a preliminary survey at an early date, and I have to emphasise to your Excellency, for the information of the Ottoman Government, that His Majesty’s Government will in no circumstances agree to the desired increase of the customs duties until the Ottoman Government show a disposition to meet their wishes with regard to this concession, and that the future attitude of this country towards the Ottoman Empire will be largely affected by the reception with which your Excellency’s application may meet. I am, &amp;c. (For the Secretary of State), CHARLES HARDINGE. r ft !iibring to the notice of the French Government and also to the French financiers invited to co-operate with us. To make things quite clear, I briefly recall the origin of the affair. An application for the concession was made between the 15th and 26th May, 1909, by Youssouf Said Bey which had in view the construction of a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. In the course of negotiations which took place between the applicant and the Turkish Government, various modifications have been introduced into the original project. As matters now stand it is proposed to construct a standard gauge railway from Homs to Bagdad forming a junction at Homs with the “ chemins de fer de Syrie.” The Turkish Government desires also the construction of a branch line from Tadmor to Damascus. Further the Turkish Government desires instead of a formal concession on the terms of a “ kilometric guarantee” to substitute for it an arrangement which will be set forth herein later on, and which has for the Turkish Government certain advantages from both an internal and international point of view, which are obvious and into which it is unnecessary to enter here. On the 17th May, 1909, Youssouf' Said Bey gave to Mr. Bernard Maimon, an English subject, “ le pouvoir exclusif et irrevocable de former des syndicats ou groupes, et eventuellement des societes pour la realisation de la concession qu’il a demandee,” and he further engaged himself as follows : “ reconnaltre comme valables tons contrats que Mr. Maimon aura signes a cet effet.” Mr. Maimon put himself in communication with my group in virtue of these powers, and by a letter dated 10th December, 1909, I declared to the Turkish Government that certain friends of my firm are willing to provide a sum of 160,000,000 fr. for the purpose of carrying out the construction of the railway con templated in the concession asked for by Youssouf Said Bey. This sum will be considerably more than is now required for the purposes of the construction of the railway as at present contemplated, which is as I have said above, a railway from Homs to Bagdad. Youssouf Said Bey and Mr. Maimon have on their part in view of the Anglo- French co-operation, which they, as well as I myself, have desired from the very beginning, entered into an engagement with you not to conclude anything definite with any French group, company, or individual, concerning the transfer of the rights to be obtained by the proposed concession, so far as the French section of the railway is concerned, without your consent. To this I agree and undertake, that in view of the agreement between us, so far as I am concerned, I leave with you the full power to form the French group, and secondly, not to come to any arrangement with any French group without your approval, it being at the same time agreed by you on the under standing that you similarly agree with me, mutatis mutandis, in regard to the English group. In the course of negotiations at Constantinople, negotiations which are not yet concluded, Youssouf Said Bey has put forward certain general conditions, the exact details of which cannot be definitely decided on until the proposed agreement between the English and French groups has been completed. From now therefore the following principles, subject to the above-mentioned agreement, are accepted by my friends :— 1. The Imperial Ottoman Government will construct the railway by means of the formation of a French-English company. 2. To this company, which will provide the necessary capital, the Turkish Government will confide the construction of the railway and its working during such number of years as shall be determined by agreement. 3. The Turkish Government will undertake to pay 4|- per cent, on the capital, whether the capital be in the form of shares or bonds, which interest shall be secured on the receipts of the railway. If these receipts are not sufficient,^ the Turkish Govern ment will engage itself to make up whatever difference is required, and will provide security for this purpose. . 4. The Turkish Government shall have the right to repay the capital of the company at par alter such a period as may be fixed by agreement. 5. Until the repayment of the whole of the capital by the Turkish Government the railway shall be administered and worked by the Franco-Enghsh company _ A representative appointed by the Turkish Government shall control the under a ung on behalf of the Imperial Government. _ . r . 6. Until the repayment of the whole of the capital the surplus receip s o t e [2707 s—4i] B 2railway, after deducting working expenses and interest on capital, shall be divided between the Turkish Government and the company in such proportion as may be agreed. 7. These general conditions shall be defined and amplified by the French and English groups in agreement with the Governments of England, France, and Turkey. 8. The company shall be formed under Ottoman law, the president of the adminis tration shall be French, the director-general English, and the members of the administration English and French in equal numbers, subject to the proportion of members which is to be reserved in the administration for Turkish representatives. 9. So far as the construction of the railway is concerned, the section from Homs to Deir shall be constructed by the French, and also the branch from Tadmor to Damascus, which the Turkish Government wish to have constructed. The section from Deir to Bagdad is to be constructed by the English. With regard to the construction of the proposed branch from Deir to Aleppo, this shall be reserved for future considera tion, and the method shall be decided by the French and English groups acting in accord. With this exception all branch lines west of a line drawn north and south through Deir shall be reserved for French enterprise, and all branch connections east of the same line for English enterprise. 10. All plant and material required for the construction of the railway shall be ordered as to one half in France and the other half in England. The above are the general conditions which my group accept, and on which they are prepared to provide half the capital required. Both for myself and my friends 1 beg you to bring the terms of this letter to the knowledge of the French Government, and submit to them our definite offer to co-operate on the conditions contained herein with a French group for the purpose of carrying out the enterprise. We empower you at the same time to form a French group, with whom we will co-operate, and to submit to them our proposition, the details of which we are ready to define in agreement with them.

M. Pichon had been willing that Frenchmen should be employed in the Financial Department in Persia, but of course he did not insist upon this. M. Cambon asked me whether I had seen the German note. I replied that I had seen it, and it was very stiff. On the other hand, the German Government had sent no note to me, and I had had only somewhat tentative conversations with Count Metternich. The line which the Germans were now taking with regard to Persia rather resembled the line they had taken with regard to Morocco in 1905. I told M. Cambon what I had said to Count Metternich about the employment of Frenchmen in Persia, and how I had explained to him that we could not let the Persians place under foreign control railways which might prejudice our political or strategical interests. Also, I had said to Count Metternich and the German charge d’affaires that we claimed no commercial monopoly in Persia, and that if the objects of Germany there were purely commercial I saw no reason why she should not get on as well with Russia and us in Persia as she did with France in Morocco. In addition, I mentioned to M. Cambon that negotiations as to the Bagdad Railway were entirely at a standstill. CONFIDENTIAL. PERSIA. [12799] No. 1. (No. 184.) Sir, Sit Edward Grey to Sir F.

' u r J ^ r ’ St. Petersburgh, April 2, 1910. I HAD a conversation this afternoon with M, Isvolsky in regard to possible German action in Persia, and I gave him in a pro-memorid the substance of your observations to the German charge d’affaires, as communicated to me in your telegram No. 156 of the 1st instant. I explained that the conversation with M. de Kuhlmann had been quite informal and unofficial, but that you thought it might interest him to know what had passed. M. Isvolsky expressed his best thanks, and remarked that your observations were most interesting. He would, he added, naturally keep me fully informed of the course of any discussions which might take place between him and the German Government in regard to the Bagdad Railway, but he doubted if they I would lead to any results. I thought it as well to give M. Isvolsky a summary in writing of your remarks, as they will be a useful guide to him in any conversation he may have with the German Ambassador. I told M. Isvolsky that I was glad we had come to an agreement as to the text of the communication to be made to the Persian Government, and that the necessary instructions had now been sent to Sir George Barclay and M. Poklewski. It would be well that the Persian Government should receive a warning as soon as possible. His Excellency remarked that as long as Great Britain and Russia held firmly together they were on very strong ground. He had not heard positively that there was any immediate intention on the part of German financiers to make an advance, and they would find the obstacles in their way very serious if they seriously contemplated such a step. As to railway concessions, he was beginning to regard that question with a certain quietude. Even supposing that the Persian Government, in spite of our warnings, granted a concession, it would be impossible for the Germans to put it into execution, in any case until the Bagdad Railway was constructed. The Russian Government would decline to allow any material to go in transit through Russian territory. I remarked that material could be imported from the south by sea. The cost of transport would perhaps be very great for northern lines, but for lines in the south the same difficulties would not exist. M. Isvolsky remarked that in his view the action of Germany was prompted by various motives. The Government perhaps wished to show the German public that they were ready to encourage and promote German enterprises in a new field ; and they also might think that they could put pressure on Russia to be conciliatory in matters connected with the Bagdad Railway. There was, further, the desire to impress on Russia that her understanding with England did not preserve her from admonitions from Berlin, and there was possibly a hope that some divergence of views might be devefoped between England and Russia. “ Enfin,” he said, “il y a un peu de tout ” in this last move of Germany. I observed that the press had now got wind of what was passing, and he said that some Russian journals had already taken up the matter. I asked if Count Pourtales had again referred to the subject, and he replied in the negative. He expects to receive a written communication before long, and I think he is quite prepared for it not being couched in very agreeable terms. I have, &amp;c. A. NICOLSON.

(No. 117.) Berlin April 22 1010 . GEBMANY in the Bagdad Corner is the suggestive title of the leading article m the National-Zeitung ” of the 20th April, which opens with a quotation from a recently published book entitled “Wanderings in Persia,” by Dr. Hugo Grothe, a well-known authority on Eastern questions. I venture to reproduce this passage in extenso, as it seems to me to possess a certain significance at the present stage of the Bagdad Bailway question :— England s most recent efiorts aim at gaming a predominant commercial position on the Persian Gulf and in Mesopotamia before the construction of the Bagdad Bail way puts German capital in a position to bring its force to bear in these regions. This object England hopes to achieve by undertaking the irrigation of ancient Chaldma, by obtaining the monopoly of the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, and by developing the petroleum springs of Mesopotamia. England’s efforts afford proof that in the struggle for these territories she regards Germany as a less determined and tenacious adversary than Bussia would be. Should England prove successful in her endeavours, and secure an undivided predominance on the Persian Gulf and in Mesopotamia, there would be very little prospect of Germany’s hopes being realised of playing a commercial r61e in Mesopotamia or of influencing the Persian market from the south and south-west. All who are familiar with the spirit and methods of the Near East will echo the hope that German diplomacy will set every spring in motion to prevent an issue arising which would cause Germany to recede fifty years in the estimation of both Turks and Persians.” The “ National-Zeitung ” says that this passage in Dr. Grothe’s book goes to the very root of the competition between England and Germany. After upholding the right of the Deutsche Bank to enter into financial negotiations with the Persian Government without consulting Anglo-Bussian sensibilities, the article observes that England is working hard to close the “ Indo-Egyptian ring ” by drawing the Perso-Mesopotamian segment of the circle, but that it is of vital importance for Germany to keep open the circle at this point so as to permit the passage of the Bagdad Bailway. The article concludes with the words: “ The maintenance of the open door in the Bagdad corner must be regarded by German diplomacy as one of its most important tasks.” I have, &amp;c. W. E. GOSCHEN.

I saw the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon and communicated to to him the substance of Sir E. Goschen’s telegrams Nos. 25 and 26. I gave him at the same time a summary of your telegram No. 174 containing your observations on the German attitude. M. Sazonow expressed great gr .titude for the communication, and said, in reply to my enquiry, that he had received no fresh information on the subject from Berlin, but that the German Ambassador here had told him verbally that he was willing to reopen the conversations on the subject which had taken place in 1907 and had then been interrupted. Germany, Count de Pourtales had said, would not ask for any concessions in the Russian sphere if Russia, on her side, would undertake that any railways which she might construct in North Persia would be linked up with the German line from Bagdad. His Excellency suggested also that no opposition should be raised by Russia to the employment by the Persian Government of one or two Germans. I impressed upon M. Sazonow the absolute necessity of the British and Russian Governments maintaining the closest solidarity, and I said that I hoped that no step would be taken by the Russian Government without previous consultation with us. I consider this very necessary, though I did not say so to M. Sazonow, as otherwise Germany might lead the Russian Government into making arrangements inconvenient to Great Britain, M. Sazonow replied that he agreed thoroughly with what I had said, and that it was most desirable that there should be the closest understanding and the fullest exchange of views between the two Governments. On my remarking that at my audience to morrow I purposed to speak to the Emperor in that sense, M. Sazonow replied that he hoped that I would do so. During our conversation I referred to the Russian troops at Kazvin, and expressed a hope that they would be withdrawn without delay. M. Sazonow replied that his Government had now imposed two conditions on the withdrawal of these troops : 1. That the question of the attack made on the Russian consul-general while on his way to Bushire should be settled. 2. That arrangements should be made for the retention in the Cossack Brigade of the Russian officers. M. Sazonow said that he personally was rather sorry that these conditions had. been laid down, and that he would enquire whether they had actually been communicated to the Persian Government. If not, he would abandon them. I said that it would be well to do so and to get the Russian troops out of Kazvin.PocnmQHt is the Property of His Br itannic Majes ty’s Government.] sador at Constantinople had telegraphed respecting an arrangement said to have been arrived at between the German and Turkish Governments whereby there would be no further difficulties in the way of the construction of the line as far as Bagdad, and whereby guarantees would be furnished from the surplus of ceded revenues/ He enquired whether I had received any information on the subject. I replied in the negative. M. Sazonow added that, according to his information, a protest against the arrangement had been entered by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. BAGDAD RAILWAY.

Mr. Mallet informed him, in reply, that His Majesty’s Government had received this information, and that Sir G.

Foreign trade with North Persia was at present impeded by prohibition since 1883 to transport foreign goods through Transcaucasia, thus leaving caravan road of Trebizond, Erzeroum, Tabreez, and Tehran only foreign trade route. High rate on this road forbade competition with Transcaucasian route. If now Russia completed North Persia railway system by line from Julfa to Tehran, and did not build Bagdad-Khanikin line, she practically secured trade monopoly in North Persia. M. Isvolsky was now holding out prospect of above proposals being answered. He hoped that answer would be favourable, as it would clear the way for an understanding on similar lines with Great Britain.

I HAVE the honour to submit to your Excellency the enclosed notes on this vice- consular district. In a despatch which I had the honour to address to you on the 28th January last year, an attempt was made to give some account of Mosul (city) and its population. The notes which are transmitted herewith are of a more general character, and are based partly on recent events and partly on information collected in the course of the official tour which your Excellency was good enough to sanction last June (13th July—28 th September); and the two despatches maybe regarded as a sort of com pendium of such information as I have been able to collect during these two years (llth March, 1908—January 1910). I fear the result may be considered unduly long and unwieldly ; but I am convinced of two things, viz. :— 1. If the Ottoman Government chose, they could—even with the present machinery —very largely increase the revenues of the Mosul vilayet; and 2. That the potentialities of the district deserve the most careful expert investiga tion from the point of view of British commerce. In these circumstances it has seemed desirable, at the risk of being tedious, to include much otherwise insignificant detail with a view to giving a general idea of the whole. Obviously it would have been superfluous to traverse the ground so recently covered by Mr. G. A. Lloyd’s mission \ but to a certain extent, perhaps, these notes may supplement those pages of Mr. Lloyd s invaluable report, which deal with this particular district. . . . . Mosul is one of the largest provinces of the Ottoman Empire. It is certainly one of the most interesting ; and it seems not unlikely to become one of the most important consular districts at least in Asiatic turkey. , . For convenience m reference, the enclosed notes are divided into 137 numbeied paragraphS ’ 1 have, &amp;c. H. E. WILKIE YOUNG. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Notes by Vice-Consul Wilkie Young on the Mosul District. Geographical. —’Roughly speaking, the Mosul vilayet lies between latitudes 35 to 37° north, and longitudes 41° and 46° east. Its area is between 35,000 and 40,000 square miles, i.e., about equal to Ireland and Wales together. Its greatest width (from a [27101—3] B Icj ' L ° ' /'7&gt;uoint in the Shamar country some 50 miles south of Smjar to the Pers an frontier m C neighbourhood of Suleimanieh), is 300 miles. North and south its extent is about ooi) miles from the Amadia ka Z a to Jebel Hamnn (These figures take no account of the lately occupied kazas of Bane, Serdesht and Paswa on the Persian^ frontier) It is bounded on the west by the Mutessanflik of Der-el-Zor; on the east by^ the Persian provinces of Azarbaijau and Ardilan; on the north by the vilayets of Van and Diarbekir, and south by Bagdad. With the exception of Mosul (city), Tel Ajar and Siniar, all the important towns, and all the kazas he east of t e igris. 2 Belief-Mosul (city) is 980 feet above sea level. From it the great Syrian plain extends westward to (he Euphrates. To the north are the Sinjar hills rising to l 000 feet and the Judi and Amadia mountain ranges (from 4,000 to 14,000 feet). Eastward lies the tract of country which comprised Assyria proper (including the great ckfes of Nineveh Arbela, and Kalah), comparatively level at first, but rising gradually towards the Zag^s mountains on the Persian frontier (5,000 to 10,000 feet . South wards, with the single interruption of the Jebel Hamrm range, the country falls steadily with the Tigris towards Bagdad and the Gulf. .. . x , . ,, n , A 3. Rivers. —The principal rivers are the Tigris and its tributaries, the Greater and Lesser Zab, both of which fall into it on the left bank below Mosul 4. Climate . —It is impossible in a brief note to deal with the climate of so \aried a tract of country; but as regards Mosul city, it may be observed that m summer the shade temperature rises to 115° Fahrenheit, and this year (which has been exceptional) it is said to have risen to 122°. In winter there are frequently 10 to 12 degrees of frost, and four years ago the Tigris was completely frozen over (see Annex ). _ 5. Historical. —The present vilayet of Mosul is practically co-extensive with the ancient Assyria proper, the most northern of the three empires m the Mesopotamian plain. The mounds of Nineveh and the burial place of Jonah are conspicuous just across the river, Kalah (the present Nimrud where the 10,000 crossed the Zab, and where were discovered the palaces of Assurnasirpal, Shalmanezer, and Lsar-Haddon) lies about 20 miles to the south : 40 miles beyond is Asshur (where the Germans are digging), and in a radius of twelve hours to the north and north-east respectively, are Khorsabad and Bavian. Arbela, where Alexander the Great defeated Darius III, is the present E&lt;bil, sixteen hours’ ride due east of Mosul. 6 (700 B.c.).—The Assyrian Empire was at its zenith about 700 B.C., the period of the first Jewish Captivity, and the conquest of Egypt by Esar-Haddon. 7. (625 b.c.). —Nineveh was destroyed by the Medes and their allies m 625 B.c., after which the district became a Persian satrapy.^ 8. (331 b.c.). —Three hundred years later it was conquered by Alexander the Great, and after his death it became part of the dominions of the Seleucidae, who held it till 171 B.c., when their Empire was taken from them by the Parthian Mithridates I. 9. (224 a.d.). —The Parthians held the country 400 years, building great cities at Atrac and Ctesiphon, and successfully repulsing the Homans. ^ Under Severus and Crassus, they (the Parthians) were overthrown by the Sassanians in 224 a.d. f 0. The district was under the Caliphs of Bagdad 762 to 1258 a.d. when it again fell into the hands of the Persians, from whom it was taken by the Turks in 1638, though to this day the frontier has not been definitively delimitated. It is also curious to note that to this day the Turkish domination remains an alien and unpopular one: and Turkish officials seem never to lose the feeling of being in a foreign if subject land. 11. Population and Languages .—The population of the Mosul vilayet cannot fall short of a million : and in this connection it is worth noting that, as all attempts to register women in this part of the Ottoman Empire have hitherto been frustrated, and as the registration of children is so far as possible evaded, local estimates of the sedentary population may be safely multiplied by two. Any estimate of the nomad and semi-nomad tribes must be the merest guess-work. The number of their fighting men, however, is generally known approximately : and, allowing for women, children, &amp;c., this may perhaps be multiplied by five; thus 400 Hamawand rifles probably represent a tribe of about 2,000 persons. 12. Christian Population of Mosul Vilayet .—It seems likely that the Christian population, who number perhaps 100,000 in the whole vilayet, are the representatives of the ancient Assyrians whose language is in general, often exclusive, use among them. Only in Mosul city, it has been somewhat forced into abeyance by the circum stance that nine-tenths of the modern population are Arabic-speaking Moslems. But even here it is the language of the churches of all denominations. By the Assyrian language is meant of course Syriac or Aramaic in its various dialects, which wasundoubtedly the popular tongue from the earliest times—cuneiform beimr only used for o cial purposes. And Laban called it Yegar Shahadutha ” (Genesis xxxi. 47), usW words which are perfectly understood with the same meaning in the Chaldean villages W i th r e Ca ptivity the Jews took it hack with them to Palestine and at .ne beginning oi the Christian era it was spoken not only there but in Palmyra and the whole of Mesopotamia. It is still the language of all the Christians of the Jebel lur and a considerable district m Diarbekir, of all Nestorians and (as already stated) of practically all the Christians in this vilayet. ^ therefore assumed that the Mosul Christians are of one origin though denominationally divided into (1) Nestorians, (2) Jacobites, and (3), (4) recently, Chaldean Catholics and Syrian Catholics, i.e., members of the Nestorian and Jacobite communities respectively who under French missionary influence have acknowledged the supremacy of Rome. 14. There are about 10,000 Christians in Mosul city and the rest of them (90,000) are to be found in the closely adjacent villages and in the districts of Zakkho, Amadia, and Acia, i.e ., in the north of the province. Roughly speaking, there are no Christians at all nowadays in the towns and villages west, south, or east of Mosul. 15. 1 ezidis. It is difficult to estimate their numbers with accuracy—but there aie probably 60,000 of them in the vilayet. All Beg, the hereditary chief of the Yezidis has his head-quarters at Radri (nine hours from Mosul) but the greater part of his people inhabit the Sinjar hills. Their language is of course Kurdish. 16. Turkomans. —The Moslem population of Kurkuk (40,000) and Tel Afar (10,000) are Turkomans, and there are a good many of them in the villages round about Mosul, e.g., Nebi Yunis, Yarimje, Al-Kasr, &amp;c. Their language is very rough dialect of Turkish. They are very independent and quarrelsome. To this day the Turkomans of Tel Afar (twelve hours from Mosul) successfully decline to serve in the army. 17. Kurds .—Inhabit all the mountains on the north and east sides of the province, i.e., from Zakkho to Amadia, Acra, and Rawanduz, and from there southwards to buleimameh and Khanikm: (1) the Hamawand (400 families) roughly speaking operate in the triangle formed by the Suleimanieh-Kerkuk and Bagdad roads ; (2) the Jaff (10,000 families) district marches with the Persian frontier from Suleimanieh to Khanikin. 18. Other notable Kurd tribes in this district are (3) the Sindi Gulli, in the neigh bourhood of Zakkho (2,000 families); (4) the Daudie, who are neighbours and enemies of the Hamawand, and who are sedentary between Tuz Khurmati and Tauk ; (5) the Talabani of Kerkuk (2,000); (6) the Sheikh Berzeine (500), whose sphere is north of the Kerkuk-Suleimanieh road ; (7) the Dizdei (2,000), who occupy the country between the two Zabs, which was Assyria proper, and the centre of which is Karachak Dagh ; (8) the Herkie and (9) Surchi, semi-nomads of the Ashair-i-Sabaa plateau, who wander into Persia in summer; (10) the Atrush of Acra and Ymadia ; (11) the Diwani of Acra and Zibar, whose chief is the unfortunate Sheikh Barzani; (12) the Gouvi, who supply the Hamals of Mosul; (13) the Pishder of Rania and (14) the Bilbas of Keui- Sanjak. Where figures are given, they do not claim to be more than approximate ; and though they do not always accord with the estimates of recent travellers, it is not suggested that they are based on better authority. Accuracy is unattainable. 19. Jews. —In the course of a recent tour (referred to below) it was noticed that there was hardly a town or village in the province without its Jewish contin gent, in fact there appears to be a pronounced Hebraic wave extending from Mosul eastwards right away to the Persian frontier and beyond as far as Hamadan. It probably had its origin in the First Captivity. The remarkable progress made in recent years by the Jews of Bagdad suggest that the Jews of this district have not improbably a great commercial future before them, a matter which is not without interest for ourselves (vide paragraph ). 20. Arabs. —Excepting the Yezidis of the Sinjar and the Turkomans of Tel Afar, mentioned above, the population west of the Tigris is exclusively Arab, chiefly of the Shamar and Jiburi tribes. Eastward of the Tigris the Arab fringe (Leheb, Bayat, Jiburi, &amp;c.) extends to an imaginary line drawn from Kerkuk to Salahieh (Kissi), consequently, from Mosul southwards to Bagdad the population is exclusively Arab. 21. Products of the Mosul Vilayet. —The following list is only intended to give an idea of the variety of the products of the district. Many of these, of course, are not exported, but every one of them is to be found in the market, and consequently has a local commercial value :— Horses (to India) ; cattle, buffaloes, and sheep (to Damascus, Egypt, &amp;c.) ;camels hides (to Europe and America); intestines (to Europe); albumen (to Marseilles); liquorice (to America) ; wheat and barley (to Bagdad and India); durra, Sf tobacco sesame gum tragacanth (two kinds), linseed, lentil peas, wool (to Sand and America/; mohair (to Europe); fur, silk honey, manna walnu s, hazel nut! pistachios, almonds, figs, raisins, olives, opium, turpentine, alkah, fennel, myrrlg. coriander, colocynth, rhubarb, hyssop, samphire soap-bark mustard camomile, lemon- grass nigella, cummin, lavage, wormwood, angelica and others of which it is not easy to be’sui! of the English names, but of which samples have been collected and sent to the Board of Trade; mulberries, lemons, peaches, apples, pomegranates, apricots, pears oranges, grapes, quinces, melons, cucumbers tomatoes, onions, beans, acorns (are important articles of consumption among the poor), &amp;c. i j -i P 23. Minerals. —Coal, petroleum, asphalt, &amp;c„ pitch, sulphur, salt iron, lead, silver, copper, arsenic, alabaster of two kinds, and a substance called gdl which I presume to be a kind of fuller’s earth. Its presence suggests the possibility of aluminium. 24. Recent Events, 1908-9.~The revival of the constitution proved a convenient opportunity for getting rid of an unpopular vah Mustapha Beg, the brother of the notorious Izzet Plsha) ; but this personal satisfaction apart the new order o things found the people of Mosul without enthusiasm, and has left them rather complacently sceptical of the success of this new experiment on the part of then rulers. Abdul Hamid is frankly regretted, and it was curious to note the promptness with which an unfavourable estimate of his successor found general acceptance Ihe ex-Su tan was, at least, a power and a name to fear ; with his withdrawal the old familiar landmarks of authority seem to have disappeared, and the population have come not unnaturally, to the conclusion that the dislocation here is only the reflection ol the state o things at Constantinople. In short, the Government have lost prestige, and have not yet contrived to demonstrate the merits of the new dispensation. The conduct of the first parliamentary elections and their result, in the sending to Constantinople of individuals who command no special respect among their fellow-citizens, have not diminished the general sentiment of cynical misgiving for the future. 25. Mustapha Beg was succeeded as vali by the Fenk Zekki Pasha, former y an instructor in the military academy at Constantinople, who—as was anticipated—proved a failure. With no administrative or personal reputation, it required little ingenuity on the part of the ulema and notables to completely shatter his authority. I e occasion was the massacre of Sheikh Sa'id (6th January, 1909). Two mont s o anarchy followed, and Zekki Pasha was providentially transferred. . 26. Beshid Pasha, his successor, had been vali of Bitlis, whence he arrived here on the 1st March, but left again within thirty-six hours for^ Kerkuk and Suleimame , with the purpose of restoring order amongst the Kurds. His promises to punish those responsible for the Sheikh Said affair had a calming effect for the time, but, as these have so far been only very partially fulfilled, discontent has continued to smoulder, breaking out from time to time, as in the Hamawand affair of last June. Reshid Pas la returned precipitately to Mosul on the 11th April, in consequence of the very thieatenmg, and, indeed, critical state of affairs which then prevailed here, and it is not improbable his arrival, and the prompt arrest of some of the promoters of the Mohamedie Associa tion, were only just in time to avert grave trouble. brom that time on, however, Beshid Pasha was harassed by intrigues, carried on largely through the medium of the press, and in August—somewhat unnecessarily, as it seemed—he was recalled. ^ 27. The Ferik Mohamed Fazil Pasha Daghistani is thus the fourth vali in Mosu in less than a year and a-half. It is impossible not to like him, but he has yet to show his capacity to govern. Though apparently a man of action rather than affairs, it is not unlikely—in a place where the personal element counts before everything he may succeed if given a chance. To a fine presence, extraordinary physical strength and a proved reputation for courage and endurance, he adds the advantages of good birth, keenness on sport of all kinds, and complete indifference to money—qualities enormously respected here, and which have already won for him a better position than that of his recent predecessors. His fine horses and crowd of Daghistani servants are approved as fitting the state of the Governor-General, and in satisfactory contrast to the poor figures cut by the others, who were flouted accordingly'. 28. Sheikh Said. —The late Sheikh Said w T as chief of the clan which for many years has been predominant in Suleimanieh and surrounding country. He was a personal favourite of Sultan Abdul Hamid, who was in the habit of telegraphing for the sheikh’s prayers. Expelled from Suleimanieh for their intolerable tyranny m November 1908, he and his sons came to Mosul, where with a crowd of Kurdish retainers they lived in great state for a couple of months. In the course of one of theperiodic disturbances, by means of which the ulema and notables are in the habit of embarrassing the Government, the whole party were butchered (only about half-a-dozen escaping out of thirty) by the mob on the 6th January last. Upwards of fifty other persons are supposed to have been killed. 29. After long delay enquiries were begun, and over a 100 people (many of them piobably innocent) thrown into prison. The enquiry is still dragging on, and there seems no prospect of its termination. It is not improbable that the more important of those responsible for this affair have hitherto escaped scot-free ; and that much of the recent trouble in the Kerkuk-Suleimanieh district may be attributed to the vindictive fury of this powerful clan at obtaining no satisfaction from the Government for the massacre of their chief. At the moment of writing (the 31st December) it is stated that summonses have been issued for the arrest of 140 persons suspected of being concerned in this affair : and on the other hand an agitation is in progress for the release of those who have been detained—but not yet tried—during the past six months. 30. Ramawand Affair. —The sheikh said clan are schemists, not fighters. They organise and intrigue, and.trifle with the local authorities: but their outdoor work is done for them by the TTamawand tribe who hold the road between Kerkuk and Suleimanieh—and part of that between Kerkuk and Bagdad. In June last they cut up a body of Turkish troops, and there has been much talk of “ exterminating ” them but, so far, no result. In August over 3,000 troops were concentrated at Chemchemal for the purpose ; but the Hamawand melted quietly away across the Persian frontier, where they waited for the ardour of the local authorities to cool down, or to be dissipated by other preoccupations. For the moment they seem to have been overlooked. 31. Acra-Zibar Affair (Sheikh Barzani). —Meanwhile operations on a big scale have been in progress against a certain Sheikh Barzani in the neighbourhood of Acra. The origin was a personal quarrel between the sheikh and a neighbour, Osman Agha. But the latter, through his partner in the ownership of various villages, Sabonji Pasha, enlisted the authorities on his side, and by cleverly hustling them into extreme measures, e.g., destruction of villages, carrying off of women, &amp;c., drove his rival into desperate resistance, thus giving the sheikh’s quarrel with himself the colour of rebellion. The sheikh has offered to surrender on condition of his case against Osman Agha being fairly heard, but his overtures have been ignored. Meanwhile there is a price upon his head, eight battalions are supposed to be pursuing him, and, owing to the severity of the season, are probably being detained in various villages—entailing great cost to Govern ment, discomfort to the troops, misery throughout a large district and no advantage to anyone except the sheikh’s personal enemies. 32. Sabonji Pasha. —Has been for some years the most important man in this part of Mesopotamia. A description of him will be found in a despatch No. 21 of the 22nd of October last to the embassy. 33. Arabs. —About a year ago, Ziwar Effendi, lieutenant of Ester Suar, was sent to protect a caravan of salt belonging to the public debt. In the course of an encounter with the Shamar, Ziwar Effendi was killed and several of his men wounded. More recently, the Shamar, pillaging within two and a-half hours of Mosul, again came into conflict with some gendarmes escorting an Aleppo caravan. Three months ago the Diem Arabs drove off 4,000 sheep from villages within five hours of Mosul. There has been much talk of punitive measures but nothing has been done in either case. The Shamar exact, as a matter of course “ khawa ” from all caravans at the rate of Is. per load. 34. Elkosh Nestorians. —The people of Elkosh were originally Nestorians, i.e., followers of Mar Shimun, Patriarch of the Syrians of the East, who resides at Kudshanis in van. Last century, under French missionary influence, they were induced to acknowledge the supremacy of the Pope. Since the Constitution, they have been endeavouring to revert to their ancient church ; but the movement is being vigorously and harshly opposed by the Boman Catholic Chaldean Patriarch and his subordinates who are wholly unscrupulous in their methods. Their triumph would be the triumph of reaction, and must be viewed with dismay by well-wishers of the Constitution. 35. Reshid Beg. —Beshid Beg, Mir of Berwari, who was punished upon repre sentations made by the late Lord Carrie in 1897, has quite recovered his local influence, and continues his persecutions of the Nestorians unchecked. 36. Frontier Question. —The Persian frontier question does not appear—so far as can be judged locally—to have undergone any material change since the revival of the Constitution. In August (1909) there were Ottoman troops at Bane, Serdesht, and Paswa, and these places appeared to be regarded as embryo kazas of the Mosul vilayet. [2710 /—3] C37 Navigation of the Kg™— Considerable interest has been aronsed by a succession of ^telegrams received by Mosul notables ura-ine a vigorous protest against the granting of the navigation concession to a man Otton^n company ; but as no information on the subject is yet available here and ^ the upper classes! ^n the whole, have sense enough to see their own interest in an improvement of their communications-no matter how or m whose hands-the Bagdad appeal has so far fallen on deaf ears. It is not impossible, however, that the agitation may be re^wed.^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the province . and a n additional blow is' constantly being struck at trade by the incessant commandeering of pack- homes and mules for use in the various so-called “ military operations. In self- defence, owners are compelled to conceal their animals, and trade remains at a standstill^ ^ rhe ^ becomes more a nd more irregular, very rarely arriving on the right day, and sometimes as much as a fortnight late. B 40 “Telegraph —Telegraphic communication has not yet been established with the following kazas: 'sinjar, Amadia, Dehok Acra, Kama, Gulamber, and is not very certain with Suleimanieh. The same may be said of the post in those districts. 41 Church Missionary Society Missien.-The net result of ten years spasmodic efforts 'is distinctly poor; and it is undeniable that the operations of this society ,n this district compare very unfavourably in many respects with those of other missions in Turkey whether Capucian, Jesuit, German, American or Jewis . T e medical work is good while its lasts, but, as there is no continuity, the population lose as much as they gain, owing to the fact that, as the Church Missionary Society are nominally in possession of the “field” and always “on the point of establishing themselves permanently,” no other European doctors will come here at all. It has thus happened that now for the best part of three years Mosul has been without doctor or hospital. It is understood that difficulty is experienced in inducing the right type of missionary to come here ; but the present position is not a matter for congratulation to a great and wealthy society. . • • . , i T 42. Jewish Mission.—A very difficult story is told by the mission to the Jews established by the Alliance IsraeliteHbarely two years ago. _ Li the most despised and miserable quarter of the city, and out of the most unpromising material, a flourishing school has been created which is attended not only by Jews but by children ol the best Christian and Moslem families. It is understood that about 1,000^ a-year is expended. French is very well taught, and it is believed that the “ Alliance would be willing to make provision for instruction in English if approached from the right quarter. 43. Jacobites .—This community have lately addressed an appeal to intelligent charity in England in the hope that help may be forthcoming to them in the way of instruction. The matter seems worth considering from a purely commercial point of view. . ^ • iv/r l 44. Foreign interests .—Till five years ago the only foreign influence m Mosul was the French, which has been gradually establishing itself for the best part of a century. In 1905 a German vice-consulate was established, then (in 1908) a British, and finally (four months later) a Bussian. 45. Russian .—The Bussian vice-consul, who is supposed by some people to be an officer masquerading as a civilian, only remained in Mosul two months and then left for Bagdad, since when nothing has been heard of him, though it is constantly stated that he is on the point of returning. A house has been taken and a flag-staff erected ; but the flag is not hoisted, and there is no one in charge. The whole thing is rather mysterious, more especially as the vice-consul did not speak Turkish or Arabic, had held no previous appointment in consular service, and seemed to attach very little importance to his relations with the local authorities and inhabitants. 46. German .—The German vice-consulate is always at some pains to explain that its only duties are in connection with the excavations at Shergat, in which the Emperor is supposed to take a deep personal interest; and, as the vice-consul seems to be at liberty to divide his time between Van, Bitlis, Shergat, and Mosul; he comes comparatively little into contact either with the local authorities or people here. 47. French .—French official interest is centred in the Papal delegacy, the Dominican Mission (consisting of about 25 fathers and nuns), and the protected Chaldean Catholic and Syrian Catholic Churches with their numerous monasteries and schools. The above, working together, form an important organisation with ramifications all over the north of the province, i.e., from Mosul to Zakkho, Amadia, and Acra. There are also small Catholic congregations at Kerkuk and Suleimanieh.• Enj o y m g the very active protection of the French vice-consulate, this organisa- lon contrives not only to influence its policy but apparently to exercise a strong n Vef - m&lt; ^ lvl ^ ua ^ French officials; and, though it is not suggested that either the ^Jtrench vice-consul or the Papal delegate are in overt understanding with certain Moslem allies of the Chaldean Patriarch, it would be absurd to ignore the fact that t ere is common ground on which for certain purposes they may be regarded as one the aim of the Chaldean Partriarch is to subjugate all Nestorian Christians and of the Syrian Catholic Archbishop to do likewise with the Jacobites ; the Dominican Mission is here to promote and organise these endeavours; and the Papal delegate in Mesopotamia is the guide and patron of the whole movement, which—as stated above— torms the sum and total of French official interest in this part of the Ottoman Empire. I he explanation of the co-operation of certain undesirable Moslems is generally not far too seek, e.g., Keshid Beg’s feud with the Nestorians makes him a ready and useful tool for the Patriarch, while the notorious Sabonji is constantly in need of the support of the Chaldean and Syrian priests and bishops in order to retain his seat on the administrative council. 49. In attempting to give an account of affairs in this district it is unfortunately not possible to overlook the bitter hostility and petty intrigues with which the “ party” described above oppose all efforts for the good of the population which happen to emanate from any other quarter than that with which they themselves are associated. Beference was made to this subject by Mr. Lloyd, who is understood to have trans mitted to the Foreign Office a copy of the Chaldean Patriarch’s sermon against the English (1907k Again and again during the past twelve years the plans of American and English missionaries for securing land, &amp;c., have been foiled by the same malign influence ; and though, in case of emergency, the Dominican fathers and nuns are under the necessity of having recourse to the English medical mission, there are indications that they bear it no good will, and friendly advances on the part of the missionaries have been repeatedly and unkindly repulsed. More than this, on two recent occasions of a death in the English mission, there have been no signs of sympathy on the part of the French—an attitude which seems unpardonable in a fanatical Moslem city where the European colony is very limited. In the circumstances relations have for some months ceased between the two missions. With an idea of mitigating a regrettable state of things, the British vice-consul from the first took some trouble to be civil to the French missionaries with whom his relations are without exception correct and, to all outward appearance, perfectly friendly; and it seems a pity the French vice-consulate is prevented from making a similar effort if only for the sake of appearances. The state of affairs described is quite without parallel in other districts known to the writer; and it would almost seem that the “ French party” in Mosul are at present unable to regard a foreign influence, however innocent of hostile designs, otherwise than as a danger to their long-established predominance. 50. Italy and Austria. —It has been several times rumoured that Italy and Austria were on the point of sending vice-consuls to Mosul, but it is not known with what truth. 51. America. —From information received from private sources it appears that the State Department were quite recently considering the question of sending a representa tive to Mosul. The return from America of a native gentleman, originally of Mosul, with specimens of American machinery was reported and commented on in a despatch No. 31 of the 4th December, 1909. 52. British Interests. —A British vice-consulate was established in Mosul in 1908. Its aim has been purely commercial. It would seem thaf there was a brief succession of vice-consuls in Mosul some quarter of a century ago; but it has been impossible to ascertain anything about them locally, and, as their archives appear to be missing, everything has had to be begun from the beginning. In the circumstances these two years have been necessarily devoted to quietly laying the foundations of wffiat is in fact a new post. 53. An effort has been made to collect as much information as possible about the district as a whole ; and, with this purpose in view, no opportunity has been neglected of getting to know all sections of the population. 54. Openings for commercial enterprise which seemed to suggest themselves have been reported from time to time, but, of necessity, rather with the view of attracting the attention of those who should be interested than of attempting to do what can only be done by experts. This applies particularly to openings for machinery in a district where it is practically unknown. A consul, unless he be a specialist, can only8 point out and suggest in the hope that the expert may think it worth while to come and “J es «f te e haB been made to familiarise the native with the merits of certain r . s . The “ 6 Pe w“nfof% r eTrity d is the curse’in this district of all enterprise and does not of course affect British trade more than any other. It has been found, however, that tLreTs one formidable stumbling-block to be reckoned with which is peculiar to our- thereis one io abcenee 0 f continuity in British efforts m the past. This is nl only a d tradition it has become a local proverb, aptly illustrated by the tentative and futile proceedings of the English mission, and more vaguely by a dimly recollected serfos of ephemeral vice-consulates. The idea is that “ the English are here to-day, but they will be gone to-morrow,” and it is certain that the half-and-half measures which have curiously characterized our efforts m this district hitherto are often contrasted with the stability of the French in a manner which wdl F^a% ^tinue for some time to react upon our understandings. W ith a \ lew to ctisp g delusions a rather special endeavour has been made to give an appearance of solidity and permanence to the present vice-consulate and everything connected with ;t. This matter is referred to at length m a memorandum of the 12th Januaij, 1910 57 Barring the unfortunate misunderstanding referred to in paragraph 49, and which will perhfps allow itself to be overcome in time very friendly relations exist with all classes of the population and with the local authorities. . , . 58 The foregoing are the subjects which have mostly occupied attention during the past two years (11th March, 1908—January 1910). . .. . P 59 The route followed in the course of the tour on which the following notes are based was down the Tigris from Mosul to Bagdad by raft thence by road to Kerhek ami Neief (and back to Bagdad), and so to Khanikm, Krfn, Tuzkhurmati, Eerkuk, Suleimameh, Gulambar, Band, Serdesht, Kala Dize, Itania Keni-Sanjak Alton Kupn, ErRAcra, Amadia, Zakkho and back to Mosul. It had been intended to includ RawanduzandSmjar; but, owing to military operations which were in progress the former was unavoidably omitted, and as by the 28th September the tour had already covered some 2,000 miles and extended to twelve weeks, it seemed desirable to deter Sinjar for another occasion. With these two exceptions every town and village ol importance in the district were visited. . „ A P 60. The journey from Mosul to Bagdad, roughly 300 miles, is ordinarily performed by raft, and takes from two to fourteen days according to season. When the ligris is in flood it has even been accomplished in slightly under forty-eight hours ; but t is is exceptional, and, when the river is high enough to make it possible, it is dithcuit to induce the raftmen to face the risk. The construction of the kelek (raft) has not changed for 4,000 years and is pretty well known, and it will be suiiicient to observe that the one employed on this occasion was composed of poplar poles tied together with reeds and supported by 200 inflated sheep-skins. ^ A light wooden frame work neatly covered all over with liquorice twigs, afforded fair shelter from the sun and sufficient space for a camp-bed and table. A lean-too had been erected for the rest of the party, five in number. As the moon was nearly full, there was no danger to the raft in travelling night and day, and Bagdad was reached on the morning of the sixth day, the 13th July. The cost of the raft was 13/. Such a raft can parry about 9 tons of merchandise. Freight varies, however, with the price of skins from time to 61. Seramun. —Four miles below Mosul on the top of a cliff (right bank) stands the castle of Seramun, the residence of the Abdul-Jelil zades who w^ere formerly hereditary rulers of Mosul. Near it is found sulphur and, it is said, copper. 62. Hammam Alii. —The first place of interest passed on the way down stream is Hammam Alii, about 10 miles south of Mosul. Here there is a famous mineral bath said to be efficacious for rheumatism and various skin disease. It is visited from all parts of the vilayet and even from other districts, and probably it would be no exaggeration to say that between 30,000 and 40,000 persons go there in the course of the summer. The village is very small and miserable, and offers no accommodation for visitors, but the municipality of Mosul grant a concession to certain individuals to e £ect mud booths roofed with reeds, which they let at a rate varying from £ T. 1 to £ T. 3 a piece. No other provision is made for the health and comfort of visitors, and half-an- hour’s experience suggests that a fortnight at Hammam Alii can be no unmixed pleasure, and is probably not without its dangers.63. Hamm am Alii seems to be a place which might be further exploited with pront. ^ Literally a few pounds would suffice to put the bath itself in order; accommoda- lon might be easily improved, and a line of vehicles running backwards and forwards ^from Mosul during the summer months should pay. At other seasons they could be urned on ^ to the Aleppo-Mosul or Bagdad-Mosul routes. At present there are only three carriages in Mosul, and exorbitant prices are charged for the shortest excursion outside the city. 1 ' ^ Hammam Alii an enterprising native was trying experiments with some kind of natural gas which bubbles up from various stagnant pools, and is easily ignited with a match. He had even conveyed it by tubes to the neighbouring bath. tj'* ^ ler 9 a t’ About 60 miles south of Mosul Kaleh, Shergat is the ancient Asshur. \ lve German professors are excavating, and continue their operations right through the heat of the day with the thermometer at 115° in the shade. Fortunately for them it is a few degrees cooler than Mosul, and very much healthier. It is calculated that the cost of this archaeological mission cannot be much less than 6,000L a year. Its very interesting results are given to the world from time to time in a series of mono graphs, and need not be dwelt upon here. Asshur was, of course, the original capital of the Assyrian monarchy. 66. Gayara Oil-Fields —A visit had been paid in March to the oil-fields at Gayara. These have been referred to by many authorities, e.g., Sir Boverton Bedwood, W. F. Ainsworth, du Caillard, Cernik, Cunningham Craig, Mr. Pilgrim (of the geological^ survey of India), and the writer of these notes has no intention of putting forward his own impressions on so difficult and important a subject. It does, however, seem strange that the authorities quoted above, and others, have confined themselves to passing references or speculations, and that no serious investigation has yet been undertaken, more especially as it would appear that Gayara “ forms part of a vast oil-field which ranges from Hit on the Euphrates to Zakkho.” It will be remembered that last year, when the Daire-i-Sanie advertised for expert assistance, British firms on being informed of the opening remained absolutely apathetic, while a French expert hurried to the spot and spent three months working there at the most trying season of the year for a mere nominal salary, a circumstance which would seem to suggest that the potentialities of this field were then an open question in qualified European circles. During the period of political uncertainty which followed the revival of the constitution in the autumn of 1908, the French expert left to take up an appointment in Europe, and the result of his investigations has been kept, locally at least, a secret. At the time of the writer’s visit, the workings were deserted and the place was littered with derelict plant. 67. FI Hadr. —About eight hours inland from Shergat I visited El Hadr, where are the remains of a Parthian palace and city. Of the latter, little but the city wall remains ; but the palace is one of the most magnificent ruins in Turkey. One of the rooms is 130 feet long, and the vaulted ceiling about 60 feet high. Probably a good description is to be found in one of Lady Ann Blount’s books. I believe she was one of the last Europeans who have been there. The Germans have made two or three excursions there from Shergat; but they say that only to the jealousy of the Arabs, they are never able to stop more than a night at a time. El Hadr is Atrae, where Severus was defeated by the Parthians in a.d. 226. The place, though of course well known to the Arabs, had been forgotten by Europe ; and even its whereabouts was unknown until discoverd by a Dr. Boss of the British residency at Bagdad about 1840. It would seem that the stone employed in its magnificent masonary was brought from the Sinjar hills by raft along an ancient water-course, now dry. 68. The only other places of any size passed between Mosul and Bagdad are Tikrit and Samarra. Both are in the Bagdad vilayet, and consequently this report is not concerned with them. 69. Bagdad. —During a short stay at Bagdad interviews were sought with the representatives of the three British firms there, and somewhat uphill efforts made to induce these gentlemen to take a more practical interest in the commercial development of Mosul. Visits were also paid to the ice factory and to various pumping-stations and flour mills. 70. Kerbela. —From Bagdad an expedition was made to Kerbela, a city of perhaps 70,000 inhabitants, i.e., considerably smaller than Mosul, but whose inhabitants appear to be very much more go-ahead. English machinery has been imported, and two large ice-making machines are being worked—one by a Bussian, the other by a British Indian subject, at an encouraging profit. Kerbela is of course an intensely fanatical place : and it was noticed that all those employed in the ice-making process were [2710 /—3J DMoslems. The writer and his party were ^wnev^hvng with great courtesy, but were particularly requested “ not to touch wa8 g made via fiakuba, 71.

Qrir | 74. Tuz Khurmati (6th August).—Is the centre of a flourishing nahie a surrounded with date-palms and orchards (oranges, pomegranates, olives tigs, a pncotsj seemed a beautiful oasis in the blazing heat of a Mesopotamian August. Rich es ™ ate the population at 5,000 in his day; but I do_ not think it can _ be more than 1 500 a present. It is exclusively Moslem and Jewish. The bazaar is relative y arg , stocked and surprisingly busy. Mr. Lloyd has dealt with the oil and salt springs m this neighbourhood in his report (1908) p. 97 and I do not pretend to add to his information, though I think he somewhat underestimates the price ot the oil ana it 75. Note. —The Bayat tribe in this neighbourhood are of Turkoman origin, though nowaday there is probably a strong mixture of Arab blood. Nadir Shah seems to ave carried them captive to Khorassan (Ritter). . 76. Taouk. —From Tuz Khurmati to Iftihar the ride was continued by night owing to the excessive heat. The country rises to a chain of hills on the right but pro a y falls uninterruptedly on the left to the Tigris. The Taouk Su, which appears o e a great and formidable river in spring is quite insignificant at this time of year. 77. Taouk was reached on the 7th August. It is the head-quarters of a na 1 ^ a poor little place and there are nowadays scant signs of the orchards extol e y Ollivier and other travellers. It was once a bishopric, and Rich discovered the rums c a fine church ; but the present population is exclusively Moslem and Hebrew. 78. Kerkuk. —An easy night march by a good track across the Matarra i s brought one to Kerkuk early on the morning of the 8th August. Here I was ae aye a week by the local authorities who gave me to understand that the road to Suleimanie was still—as, indeed I knew it had been for nearly five months—impassable owing o the presence of the Hamawand communications (including the telegraph) being cut. 79. The intention was probably to prevent a foreigner from seeing the state ol ® country ; and it was only after it had been made clear that I could and would wait un i the road was open that arrangements were made for my proceeding with an escort othirty cavalry. My doing so was not without satisfactory result as on the very day w? r * amve d at Suleimanieh, an immense caravan (which had been gradually accumu- latmg tor months but afraid to venture on the road) left for Kerkuk, Mosul, and Bagdad. ^Lhree days later the telegraph was again working. The circumstance is only worthy of ^rote as showing the wholesome effect upon the local authorities of the presence of Europeans who are in a position to report disinterestedly upon the state of affairs. I here can be no doubt that a determined effort would have sufficed months before to restore communications and keep them open. . -During my stay at Kerkuk I was the guest of the municipality who most kindly put the whole of their charming building—quite the prettiest of its kind in Turkey—at my disposal. There are 7,000 houses in the town and the population is probably not less than 40,000, of whom about 2,500 are Jews, and only 630 Christians. The rest are Moslems of Turkoman origin. The language of the place is consequently Tuikish, but Kurdish and Arabic are generally understood. The position of Kerkuk is remarkable, surmounting an immense artificial mound over 100 feet high, at the foot of which flows the river (Kasra Chai) which is spanned by a fine bridge. The approaches to the various gates of the ancient citadel are steep and winding and from the flat roofs of the houses, which are built up to the very edge of the mound, there is a magnificent view oyer the surrounding country. Some of the older buildings are attributed to a certain Cicallazadd, the renegade son of the Genoese Admiral Cicalla; and in former days the place was, according to Niebuhr, the residence of a Pasha of two tails. A modern town is springing up and spreading in every direction from the foot of the mound. Kerkuk being the meeting-place of the Tabreez, Mosul, and Bagdad roads, and a convenient centre for a very large (partly shifting, partly sedentary) Arab and Kurd population, its bazaar is of great and increasing importance. 81. The surrounding land is said to be of wonderful fertility but, in recent years, has suffered from the fact that the mountain streams on which it depends are constantly being tapped or diverted by the Kurds. A village called Tis-a-in w r as visited which till recently is said to have been one of the most prosperous but is now almost ruined by lack of water. There is an idea that, if a canal were cut from Altun Kipri, the superfluous waters of the Lesser Zab might be utilised for the irrigation of this district. At the request of some of the leading inhabitants, I brought the matter to the notice of Sir William Willcocks in an unofficial letter last August, but I have no means of knowing whether it is a practical proposition. 82. From a confidential souree, I happen to know that the present mutessarif has approached the Ottoman Bank with a view to a loan for the purpose of starting a flour mill and ice-making machine. The security offered is apparently certain municipal property. 83. From Kerkuk to Suleimanieh the road passes through the Bazian kaza, formerly one of great wealth but which has suffered—and is suffering—much from the overlapping of various undefined spheres of warring interests. The Hamawand are referred to at length in a despatch No. 19 of the 17th October. They are divided into three “ kabyle’s,” viz., Hamawand (proper), Besari,and Sitabasar, and number perhaps altogether 450 families. Others in this neighbourhood are : The Sheikh Bezeini (500), Shonan (1,000), Gil (400), Talabani (2,000), Hadidi (600), Abu Hamed (100), El Abed (500). The last three are Arabs. The figures given refer to households and may be multiplied by at least five in estimating the full members of each tribe. 84. A halt was made at Chemchemal, the centre of the kaza, where the governors of Kerkuk and Suleimanieh were found taking counsel with the Kaimakam (a leader of the Sheikh Said clan) as regards “ operations ” against the Hamawand; and the journey was continued via Kan-i-Shaitan and the Bazian Valley to Suleimanieh. 85. Suleimanieh (16th/23rd August). —351° North ; 45East. Altitude 2,800 feet. Founded in 1783. Population (in 1909) 30,000. Distance to Mosul, 7 days; Bagdad, 8 days; Senna, 4 days ; Kermanshah, 5 days ; Tabreez 12 days. 86. The above figures seem to speak for themselves; Suleimanieh, founded by Babanzade Suleiman Pasha barely 130 years ago, is a centre which has grown—and must obviously continue to grow—in importance as fast as the security of the district allows, while its altitude and geographical position give it advantages of climate not possessed by any other considerable town in the province. Lying unobtrusively in the folds of the hills, Suleimanieh is apt to be overlooked by passing tourists, who have even been known to dismiss it as “ an overgrown village ” ; but a closer inspection discloses an extensive covered bazaar or &lt;c kaiseria,” out of all proportion to the size of the town, and supplying the wants of a very big district. In August 1909 this bazaar was thronged from sunrise to sunset with a mixed crowd of Arabs, Kurds,* V I : i' Ther'e are “wlrfitThaV and ™ s buildin g’ ^ sides an extension of ^a^dbrickor of mud, and have no upper storyf hut those of the well-to-do are of baked brick, and compare favourably with anythmg f tma at Khlrnut or Erzerum. Almost every house has its garden, and there is a nlentiM supplf of water everywhere. Snow is brought daily from the mountains, and plentitm suppry ui w u j drawback of Suleimameh as a summer fhrit and vegetables are ^n^ ^ X^nd which sometimes prevails for 0f dU o St 8 The population, excepting a score of Christian families and some hundreds of Tews^^are exclusively 0 Moslem, and fanatical and wild to a degree. The Christians, Mo have a church Ini two priests, inhabit a little quarter of their own on the ou ^ nf the town where it would seem they live in continual fear toi then property ana lives 6 Except perhaps in parts of Armenia, such terror and mute subjection to the Xr c^te are fortunately not often met with ; but it is necessary to go to Sule—h [n orderlo reaUse the helpless isolation of this little colony and the conditions under ^8^ IS Said Clan. —The town and surrounding country-wdth P^icany all the officials civil and military—had been for years under the thumb ot the bheitti Said and his disreputable sons, of whose vices and tyranny endless stories are related “ Under the shadow of the constitution,” however, popular hatred began to show itself openly there were formidable disturbances, and finally the old sheikh and his famfiy vrere compelled (in November 1908) to remove to Mosul, where they became the vie of the rismf of the 6th January. In revenge for this the survivors did their best to raise the country, and so far succeeded in alarming the Government that they have been left to themselves ever since, and have more than recovered their fame supremacy During the week spent at Suleimameh I was the guest of the Government, the mutessarif (who was absent) having most hospitably put his house and servants at my disposal. Consequently, I saw and heard a good deal of according to the custom of the country—paid me long visits almost daily. y in greatfstate, are accompanied everywhere by a crowd of armed servants, entertain lavishly and are evidently very generous when occasion requires. It was easy to see that the local authorities were in awe of them ; valuable presents are not to be despised and, even under the constitution, “accidents after dark” have been known to overtake the recalcitrant. In short, the Sheikh Said clan are still the terror of Suleimameh, and their authority is absolutely unchallenged. A great part of the town belongs them, and they “own” numerous villages in the neighbourhood, and also in me adjacent kazas of Shahrbazar and Gulamber. Note. The meaning “ ownership ” in this connection may be here explained; it has an important bearing on the condition of the whole vilayet. 90. On some pretext or other—seldom for money, generally in return for the promise of protection villagers are induced to hand themselves over to a beg, agha, or notable, in whose name the village is henceforward registered and who becomes officially and legally its owner. The villagers continue their occupations as be ore but (in addition of course to Government taxes) pay tribute of their produce to their “owner” in the following proportion :— (a.) On wheat, barley, and unirrigated crops one-fourth of entire produce. (b.) On produce of irrigated land, e.g., tobacco, rice, cotton, sesame, &amp;c., one-ha of the entire produce. 91. Thus “ownership” cost nothing but a very nominal measure of protection while it reduces the villagers themselves to a position not far removed from slavery, and the continued insecurity of the country becomes up to a certain point the interest of the ruling class, as it throws more and more villages into their clutches. This is the main source of the wealth of the notables and begs all over the vilayet. All have their agents at Mosul (and the more important at Constantinople) ; and, hound together by a common interest, form a league with almost unbounded power for evil. It is dimeun to speak calmly of a state of things which is steadily reducing a wonderful province to the verge of ruin. As already reported, the Sheikh Said clan have friends^ at Constantinople, an agent at Mosul (Sabonji Pasha) and an invaluable weapon againstthe local authorities in their close allies—the Ham awand, who hold the Kerkuk . u ei . n H'. n , roa d. -tt will be seen that locally at least the combination is almost irresistible. mos ^ i m P or tant products of the Suleimanieh district are rice and tobacco. 92. Shahrzor. From Suleimanieh the journey was continued along the Gulamber valley to Halabje a district of great potential agricultural wealth but at present in onnA 11 / 08 ^ P ltia ^ e . con ^ tlon - Five years ago the produce of the Gulamber kaza was 9,000/. last year it was 800/., and the reason is not far to seek, the present kaimakam is me head of the Jaff tribe, Osman Pasha, and relentlessly persecutes the sedentary population for his own ends. In theory there is telegraphic communication between buleimameh and Halabje, and in places a good deal of wire was to be seen lying near the track, the poles had been removed for fire-wood. In the kaimakam’s garden there was a wire fence which looked very much as though from the same source. In almost a t e villages passed en route, the sight of a European was sufficient to attract the villagers who,^ without the slightest encouragement, proceeded to pour out their grievances against the rulers of the Jaff tribe and to beg that they might be reported to Constantinople. It was the same story everywhere. 93. Gulamber Valley. —Gulamber charmingly situated at the foot of the mountains show signs of having been a place of considerable importance. A fine mosque though empty and neglected, is still intact, and there is a remarkable series of reservoirs dating, I believe, from Sultan Selim. Ten years ago the population seems to have been just four times what it is at present. 94. One s impression of the situation is most pleasant: and it is difficult to believe that anything but some selfish interest dictated the transfer of the head quarters of the kaza from beautiful healthy Gulamber to pestilential Halabje. 9A The present head-quarter of the Gulamber kaza is an unhealthy, evil little town with a bad water supply. Its miserable condition is the more striking in contrast to two great vulgar houses lately erected by the heads of the Jaff tribe, Osman Pasha and Mohamed Pasha. 96. Avroman Mountains. —Halabje was left on the afternoon of the 25th August, and the road almost immediately struck in a north-easterly direction into the heart of the Avroman Mountains. 1 his is a most interesting district and becomes more and more beautiful as one advances. The road, rising steadily, winds along the side of a wide, fertile valley which the inhabitants unhesitatingly declare is the boundary between u Poum, i.e., lurkey and Iran. In three-quarters of an hour Bamuk was reached, a pretty village almost hidden in groves of fig and pomegranate. An hour later at sunset a halt was made for the night at Halpani, well situated on the hillside with a lovely view across the valley, which here widens out into a great amphitheatre. We were again told that the opposite side was Persian territory. There is plenty of water and fruit of all kinds abounds. Next day (26th August) an easv five hours’ ride excepting one rather bad place for the pack-animals—brought one vi&amp; Balkah to the neighbourhood of lawila, which is one of the summer residences of the chiefs of the Jaff tribe. 97. Tawila. The last hour of the approach is very beautiful, along a deep valley filled with fruit-trees of all kinds (peaches, pomegranates, quinces, plums, pears, mulberry and magnificent walnut-trees. The sides of the hills are artificially terraced to a consider able height; there is abundance of water and the track is completely over-shadowed by fine trees. The littfe town, piled up the sides of the narrow valley, is not visible all at once, but seems to consist of about 600 houses. This is the centre of the Avroman country, and the type and dress and language of the people seemed to be distinct from anything which had been met before, being neither Kurdish nor Persian, and perhaps not very closely connected with either. Part of the vocabulary is said to be old Persian, and there are obviously a good many Kurdish words, but they say the bulk of it is derived from the Mezenderan language, whatever that may have been. Local tradition has it that Darius and his followers fled to Avroman after their defeat by Alexander. 98. While at Tawila I was under the unpleasant necessity of accepting the hospitality of the ruling family of the Jaff tribe. The less said about them the better. I heir sordid vices and scandals are of no interest; but that this huge district should be a prey to such people is deplorable. As already mentioned the disreputable head of the tribe is also kaimakam and consequently supreme. It was disappointing to hear that the glory of the celebrated Khanum, so long their ruler, was growing very dim ; on the present occasion she did not show herself at all. Two renegade German Jews were j discovered here, living with the tribe whose dress and customs they had adopted. [2710 /— 3 ] E99. A pleasanter incident was a visit paid to the famous Nakishbendi, sheikh of Tawila, whose tekkie is visited by pilgrims from India and all parts of Moslem Asia. 100. From Tawila the journey was continued to a place called Biara, where a weird night was spent at the tekkie of another celebrated sheikh (Nejm-el-Din Nakishbendi)/ The position is remarkable—a huge natural platform densely over-shadowed by big trees, and a roaring torrent below. Over 300 pilgrims were staying there that night, and there seemed to be no end to their pious repetitions. I met a man there who described himself as the Sheikh-ul-Islam of Sinna, in Persia. Owing to some intrigue or other he had left his country, and is now receiving a pension from the Turkish Government. He declared that he had been urged by the Sheikh-ul-Isiam at Con stantinople to work for the Pan-Islamic movement in India. 101. It was noticed that all the wood-work here was of solid walnut, the planks used being of enormous size and thickness, suggesting the presence of magnificent trees somewhere in the neighbourhood. 102. Leaving Biara we descended again into the Shahrzor Valley and, after a brief halt at Gulamber, proceeded to the tents of a certain Salih Beg of. the Jaff tribe, and spent the night there. Next morning we struck eastwards into the mountains again, and a very arduous nine hours’ ride brought us to the head-quarters of the nahie. 103. Penionin. —This village, which consists of about 300 houses, is surrounded by vineyards and orchards. Besides barley and wheat, the produce of Penjouin includes cotton, tobacco, sumach, galls, manna, and rice—the latter of excellent quality. About a-sixth of the population are Jews. There are no Christians. Here again, as every where, people were complaining of the depredations of the Jafl. Ten days before my arrival, it seemed a section of the tribe had attacked the village, and there had been casualties on both sides. Osman Pasha and Mahmud Pasha the chiefs of the Jaff, had been appealed to by the villagers, but had replied that they could do nothing, though only an hour off. They themselves persecute the people outrageously, raising about £ T. 500 a-year from this small village alone, and commandeering pack-animals and any other property they may happen to take a fancy to. They had lately thrown my host, a respectable old Moslem (Haji Agha) into a pond for making a complaint. The market was altogether closed, and I understood it had been so for days as a further Jaff attack was expected. Seven or eight families had fled across the frontier the night before, and my host declared that many more would follow their example. 104. Mutinous Soldiers. —But the Jaff tribe was not the only trouble of Penjouin. The 3rd battalion of the 45th Regiment, which was then quartered there, appeared to be in open insubordination, and the men to be doing pretty much as they liked with the inhabitants and their property. I heard numerous instance of this, to take an opportunity of bringing the state of affairs to the knowledge of the mushir. He said, “We officers have become privates, and the men are our officers,” and it appeared to be the fact. The officer commanding had been to all intents and purposes confined to his quarters for five months. From the same officer I gather that the honour of the officers’ wives was by no means safe from the insolence of the men of the regiment— altogether an extraordinary state of affairs. 105. Bistan. —From Penjouin the route lay through the mountains to Bistan, an insignificant village of some twenty houses, which, however—for a reason unknown to me—is marked large on all the maps, and thence to Bane, a frontier post. All these mountains from Tawila to Penjouin, Bane, and Serdesht are thickly wooded with moun tain oak, and, though there are few really fine trees, they are of better growth than what are to be found as a rule, e.g., in the Dersin and other mountains of Kurdistan. In the valleys there is a good deal of wild pear. The produce of the villages is for the most part cotton, rice, tobacco, grapes, and the usual crops. 106. Bane Altitude is a seven hours’ easy ride from Bistan, and was reached on the afternoon of the 31st August. It is a poor little place to look at, built of sun-dried brick, and the bareness of the immediately surrounding country rather reminds one of Erzerum. They say there are about 1,000 houses, which would mean a population of perhaps 5,000. The bazaar is large and important, but very filthy. I noticed a good many Russian goods, in particular cotton prints and gaudy silks, satins, plushes, &amp;c., which are the fashionable wear. There was also a certain amount of cheap crockery and glass from the same source, and imported likewise via Tabreez. These articles can be : driven out by British when communications this side of the frontier are improved and our people take the trouble to study the market, which is peculiar. Rifles are openly made—I watched the process—and sold in the market, not secretly, as at Suleimanieh. Amongst the produce of the district are tobacco, rice, melons, grapes, maize, andsumach. Moslem. There is a large Jewish quarter; the population is otherwise exclusively 107. Frontier Question. —Whether Bane is properly speaking Turkish territorv or ersian or belongs to the neutral zone seems to be an academical question to whictT no nnal answer can be given. It would appear that no definite settlement of the frontier as ever been unreservedly accepted by both sides, and for two centuries and a half ouleimameh and the country east of it has been alternately Turkish or Persian, according to the power of the respective parties at the moment. Bane and Serdesht are at present “ Turkish because Ottoman troops are in occupation, but by association, custom, dress, and language its inhabitants are certainly more Persian than anythino- else, and probably nothing is further from their thoughts and sympathies than the conception of their homes as part of Turkey. Their acquiescence in the present state of affairs, m so far as it is voluntary, is due to the fact that for the moment they have escaped from Persian misgovernment and have not yet experienced Turkish. Bane and Serdesht are at present only “ skeleton ” kazas, and, so far as I understood they are not to be worried with officials or taxation for five years—an ideal state of things while it lasts, but ofiering no security for the future. 108 . The importance for the Turks of advancing their outposts as far as possible into the Zagros mountains seems obvious, particularly in view of the uncertain future of Persia, and Persian opposition to the plan is equally natural. But, while an honest agreement on the subject, were greatly to be desired, it would appear hopeless to base negotiations on anything so nebulous and disputable as the past status of this particular district. Some simpler basis seems desirable for a frank bargain. 109. British goods are perhaps as likely to reach Banb, Serdesht, and Paswa while these places are in Turkish hands as under any other conditions. 110. At Bane I was the guest of a certain Hama Khan, who was obviously the greatest man in the place, and a very fine personage indeed, in peacock-green satin. His brother was even more gorgeous, in mustard breeches and blue plush tunic, with an enormous belt. The Turks have made Hama Khan honorary kaimakam, but, like everybody else in Bane, he speaks only Kurdish and Persian. We sat under the usual bower of branches, and a great many people cm me, of whom it was noticed that only one understood Turkish—and he was a Haji. In short, there was nothing but the Turkish troops to remind one that Bane is a Turkish kaza. Of these there were two battalions, viz., the 1st Battalion of the 47th Begiment and the mutinous 3rd of the 45th, who arrived while I was there, and proceeded to signalise their presence by pillaging in the Jewish quarter. 111. Nemashir. —Five hours north of Banb is Nemashir, where a night was spent at the house of a splendid Agha, in an enormous, heavily-fringed turban and pale green silk tunic—minor details which, however, are not without commercial interest, besides being a strong indication of the true nationality of the wearer. 112. From Nemashir the road continues via Haurazar, Dar Savin, Benawila, and Biri-suyn to the ford of the Lesser Zab (four and a-half hours), after which two hours’ steep climb brings one to Serdesht. 113. Serdesht Altitude. —It is a beautiful position, and the view eastwards across the valley of the Lesser Zab superb—altogether a much more attractive place than Bane. It seems that, like Bane and Paswa, Serdesht is also to be kaza, but a kaimakam had not then (3rd September) been appointed. There are a couple of well- stocked caravanserais, and, so far as I could judge, everything in the way of stuffs, boots, crockery, glass, &amp;c., comes from Russia. The fruit grown here compares favourably with any part of Turkey—apples, pears, peaches, grapes, plums, &amp;c. Poplars are a very noticeable feature. 114. I stayed with the local “ Sheikh-ul-Islam ”—a title which seems in itself rather suggestive of Persia than Turkey. He was also entertaining the chiefs of Gawrik tribe, and had about twenty guests stopping with him that night. 115. Part of the 2nd Battalion of the 45th Regiment was then quartered at Serdesht. A new barracks seemed to have been built. A glimpse was caught of the two mountain guns in the courtyard, but, as the arrival of my party seemed to have given rise to some speculation, I did not press to be shown round. From Serdesht to Paswa, I understand, is two long days. These three frontier posts must be practically isolated in winter. There is no telegraph and no regular posts. The officer commanding at Paswa seemed to be making a tour of inspection. He called on me at Serdesht, and was extremely civil. 116. Pishder Kurds. —From Serdesht a track goes to Neshkilan, Bivran, and Sulta-Zeu. Shortly after it was missed, and the night had to be spent in a smallencampment of Pishder Kurds. This tribe are said to own 300 villages in the neighbourhood of Kala-Dize, which was reached on the following day. 117. Kala-Dize (Hamadie). —Though the centre of a kaza, is a wretched little place, but the district appears to be very fertile, and its produce (liquorice, cotton, &amp;c.) will become very important when the province is developed. A means of export i ready to hand at all seasons by raft on the Lesser Zab. In the house where I stayed were lying some slabs of walnut, indicating the existence of very big trees not far off. I did not happen to pass them. 118. Kaimakam, of Bania. —From Kala-Dize the journey was continued to Eania (about four hours), in the company of the newly-appointed kaimakam, wLo was making his official entry. He seems a capital fellow, very intelligent and well-informed, and entirely free from the humbug and delusions which are common to his class. He is a Leaz from Trebizond, age probably not more than 30 ; had been exiled to Rhodes under the old regime. He is the only official met in the course of this tour in any way deserving of mention. 11 9. DerbendPass. —The Kala-Dize and Rania plains are separated by a formidable ridge which is pierced by, and only by, the Derbend Pass, through which the Lesser Zab flows from one to the other. It is a striking “ defile half a-mile long and 300 yards wide, with steep rocky sides. In places the road is rock-hewn, and on the cliff is a cuneiform inscription ” (Murray). The importance of this pass to the traffic between Irak and Persia is obvious. 120 . Bania Plain. —The Rania Plain, which is fairly level, well watered, and extremely fertile, is about 25 miles long by 12 miles wide, and would appear to be an ideal place for the cultivation of cotton. The proximity of cheap river transport must not be overlooked. 121 . Bilbas Kurds. —Rania was left on the 6th September, and after a brief visit to Mohamed Agha, chief of the Bilbas Kurds (who was found holding his court in a huge bower of branches on the edge of a cliff overhanging the River Gomaya, a picturesque figure surrounded by a score of servants all profusely armed), the journey was continued to Keui-Sanjak, which is eight and a-half hours going from Rania. 122 . Keui-Sanjak has a population of 15,000 Moslems and Jews and a few Christians. The bazaar was unspeakably filthy, but seemed to be well stocked from Mosul, Bagdad, and Tabreez. Goods from the last-named place are mostly Russian, and include cheap crockery, cotton, prints, &amp;c., but this is as far westward as Russian trade has yet penetrated. I was the guest of the kaimakam. 123. Altun Keupru. —From Keui-Sanjak to Altun Keupru was two rather dreary and uneventful stages via Ilinjakh, Badespi, Hur-hur, and Hashka. Altun-Keupru is a little town of 600 houses on an island in the Lesser Zab. There is nothing remarkable about it except its, bridge, which was built in the time of Sultan Murad, with a central arch some 60 feet high. The mudir with whom I was staying has a curious residence over the bridge gateway with balconies overhanging the river. The place is important from its position on the high road between Mosul, Kerkuk, and Bagdad, and as the starting-place for the Zab “ Keleks ” which go from here direct to Bagdad. It was noticed that no less than fourteen were loading up on the 10th September, which seemed a large number for the season. 124. Erbil (ten hours from Altun Keupru) was reached on the 11th September). The present town takes its name from Arbela, where Alexander defeated Darius, though the actual battle-field appear to have been to the north-west beyond the great Zab. The following paragraph is taken from Murray :— “ Erbil, the seat of a kaimakam, a military post, and an important road centre. Most of the town is built on an artificial mound which rises 100 feet above the plain, and is crowned by the ruins of a castle. The outer houses are so built as to form a continuous line of defence, and the streets within are narrow, winding, and dirty. Water is supplied by a kariz, or underground channel. The population includes a Jewish community, but there are no Christians.” 125. From Erbil the journey was continued via Ain-Kawa (a large Christian village, formerly Nestorian, now Chaldean) to Efraz (where the Great Zas was crossed by ferry), and thence to Berderesh, which is the centre of a nahie, and the most important place in the rich Ashair-i-Sabao plain. Most of the villages hereabouts seem to be “ owned by Mosul notables on the system described in paragraph 90. Products chiefly : barley, wheat, rice, cotton, sesame. 126. Acra. —The centre of an important kaza. The approach to the town is remarkable—a succession of undulating earth-scraps and then a gorge, narrow at first,bui widening gradually, and filled with orchards, and finally a great amphitheatre where the houses are piled one above the other in tiers, the front door of one openimr - w™!* 7 01 \ t0 t 1 1 ? e roo l f 1 of ! lts neighbour below. All are of stone, mostly rough-hewn 1 + 1 ? r ten w ® blocks brought presumably from older buildings. Towering above e town, on the brow of a very steep ^ mountain, are the remains of a castle, an ancient church hewn out of the rock, a huge cistern constructed in the same way, and a number o smaller reservoirs all of which no doubt formed part of a very formidable citadel. Maving no spring, however, its water supply seems to have been brought from a neighbouring mountain by a curious syphon arrangement hewn in the rock down the an que^ 6 t ^ ^ distance between the two being too great to bridge by p A cia &gt; Amadia and Zakkho were formerly the possessions of the great Bahdinan tamdy who were connected in some way with the Caliphate of Bagdad, and so “ great ” that they never appeared in public unveiled. It seems that they were reduced, m fact practically annihilated, by a certain Mohamed Pasha Bairakdar who was the Ottoman governor in these parts some eighty years ago. tfipbably the Christain church referred to above as being in the centre ^ a * lc * inai i l citadel at Acra was built by some Nestorian prince before the Mohamedan epoch. ™ i 129 ' P 0 ?' 1 ^ 11 of Acra is probably not less than 5,000, most of whom are Moslem. ^ 1 here are only thirty Chaldean families and seven Jacobites. The Jewish quarter is considerable. _ The orchards of Acra are a delight to one coming from the bare Mesopotamian plain in August, filling the whole valley with luxuriant green. here is an abundance of water from the surrounding mountains, and I noticed figs pomegranates, pears, plums, &amp;c., and of course any amount of poplars. A great deal of rice and tobacco is grown in the neighbourhood. The people are mostly Kurdish with a sprinkling of Christians of Assyrian origin. 130. When I arrived at Acra the Turkish Government were just beginning their cisastious opeiations against the unfortunate Sheikh Barzani : and, as the latter is known locally to be deserving of sympathy, it seemed better to give his neighbourhood a wide berth for fear of misunderstandings with the authorities. I was consequently obliged to abandon my visit to Bawanduz, and went instead direct to Amadia. 131. Acra to Amadia. This was a beautiful ride of three days through rich valleys and over well-wooded mountains. I believe it should have been done in less, but we h ac l great difficulty in finding guides and even so lost the way once about sunset and had to spend the night (there was no moon) half-way up a precipitous mountain without water. The going was in places extremely difficult and the pack-animals had to be unloaded and helped repeatedly. The cultivation in the valleys, which are mostlv well-watered and extremely fertile, include tobacco, rice, maize, sesame, cotton, hemp, &amp;c. The pomegranates of Shush and Shermi are famous. From the mountains come galls, gum, tragacanth, &amp;c., which form important articles of export. In short, the district should at least be prosperous : as a matter of fact, owing to conditions which have been described elsewhere, poverty is the rule, the population is decreasing everywhere and those who remain are fortunate if they can obtain a bare subsistence. This year, to the hardships which are normal and constant, the infliction of “military operations ” has been added. 132. Amadia was reached on the 19th September. It was one of the strong places of the Bahdinan family and, occupying a superb position on an isolated, precipitous rock, may well have been impregnable under the conditions for which it was built. The city has only two gates (approached by steep, winding tracks which are almost stair ways), and is inaccessible on the other sides. The present population is probably barely 500 households, but there are ruins everywhere and it is not difficult to believe—as I am told that thirty years ago it was twice or even three times as great. It is still the official centre of the kaza. 133. Zakkho, Altitude 1,400 feet. —From Amadia the journey was continued through Kadisho,^ Daudie, Beude (the property of the notorious Sheikh Barmani—not to be conferred with the unfortunate Sheikh Barzani), Meugesh and Halafat to Zakkho, which is of course the head-quarters of its kaza. Zakkho is a picturesque old town of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants (Moslems, Christians and Jews) and, when the khabour if m flood becomes an island. The splendid old castle of the Bahdinan Begs is at present being repaired and should make a capital building for the Government if the work is properly clone. ^ Part of it was civilly put at my disposal during my stay. The Chaldean Homan Catholic Bishop complained much of the c^uel treatment his flock receive at the hands of the Sindi Gulli, whose slaves they are and by whom they are literally bought [2710 /—3] 1?and sold. I fear that this is only too true. I asked him why he did not try to interest his Patriarch and Baud Jussefani (the Roman Catholic deputy for Mosul) in the matter, but he seemed to think they were “ occupied with political affairs ” and not very likely to take it up. f 134. Dehok .— From Zakkho to Dehok via Batiski and Simel is two very easy stages, but the heat as one approached the plain (24th to 25th September) was naturally trying. Behok is a picturesque dirty little town of, perhaps, 2,000 inhabitants (Moslem, Jewish, and a very few Christians). Its gardens and orchards are famous, and a certain amount of wine is produced in the neighbourhood. As a rule, it is not very good, but I have lately some which is excellent and appreciated by persons qualified to judge. The point is worth attention. There are almonds, pomegranates, pears, plums, famous apricots, &amp;c. 135. Sheikh Nur Mohamed lives at Behok, and as all the officials appear to be completely in his power, his depredations and exactions are unchecked. 136. Sheikh Nouri lives, five hours off, at Briefka, whence he descends from time to time to harry the defenceless sedentary Yezidies of the Sheikhan nahie. 137. Baadri Head-qiM7ters of the Yezidies .—Baadri is the head-quarters of Ali Beg, the chief of all the Yezidies, and scattered though they are through Mosul, Biarbekir, Van, and even part of Russia, he seems to exert a practical authority in .collecting his dues. He complains a good deal—apparently with justice—of the tyranny of Sheikh Nouri and also of the Ottoman Government, whose policy has always been to coerce his people, and it is certainly true that those of them who are sedentary in the plains are harmless enough and little able to defend themselves against oppression. I spent two interesting days with the sheikh, and striking across the plain through the rich corn country—there are a dozen water-mills on the Khozer—returned to Mosul (nine hours) on the 28th September. Annex 1. Openings for Enterprise. The following openings for enterprise, most of which have been separately reported during the past two years, suggest themselves as suited to the district:— 1. A machine workshop in Mosul (city). 2. A general store in Mosul (city). 3. A flour mill and ice factory in Mosul (city). 4. A flour mill at Kerkuk. 5. Irrigation and other pumps. 6. Artesian deep well machinery for such districts as Elkosh, Telkef, &amp;c., and perhaps Kerkuk. This seems worth careful consideration. The proximity of mountains makes success almost certain. 7. Cotton seed and other oil presses. 8. Manufacture of soap and candles. 9. Manufacture of alkali. 10. Tanneries. 11. Agricultural machinery and implements of all kinds. 12. Cultivation of cotton might be largely increased, e.g., in the Rania Plain. This certainly deserves attention. As illustrating the ignorance of the surrounding country which prevails among even the upper classes here, it may be mentioned that many of them have been found to be unaware of the existence of the Rania and Kala-Bize kazas of this vilayet. 13. The value of the petroleum fields at Gayara, Tuz Khurmati, and Zakkho (if still an open question) would seem at least to deserve expert investigation. 14. The same observation applies to the coal which is known to exist in the Zakkho and Salahieh districts. 15. Arsenic, fuller’s earth, copper, sulphur, and other minerals. 16. A mineral which is believed to be cannel coal has been found: it is hoped to transmit a specimen to the Board of Trade. 17. Attention has been repeatedly called to the question of a bridge over the Tigris at Mosul; but it is obviously one for expert opinion. The same applies to the opening for bridge work on the two zabs, the khabur, and perhaps other streams. Itmust be remembered that communications are sometimes cut for weeks owing to the absence of bridges (the post was delayed the other day for a fortnight), and great loss ensues to the whole district, in order to avoid which heavy tolls would be willingly paid. '^It has been estimated that the tolls of the present bridge of boats at Mosul during the nine or ten months of the year when it is open to traffic, are worth some £T 3 000 to £T. 4,000. ’ ’ 18. The project for connecting Mosul with Aleppo by a service of automobiles, has been repeatedly referred to, and it has been twice suggested that it might be worth while—if only by way of advertisement—for some enterprising company to send a car along the route to investigate. Surely the idea is not unattractive':— u Across the great Syrian desert from Aleppo to Nineveh and back via Palmyra and Damascus.” March and April would be the best months for the purpose. 19. The exploitation of the hot springs at Hamam Alii is perhaps rather for local enterprise, but cannot be overlooked in the most cursory review of “ opening's ” in the district. 20. Again, as matters rather of local interest, the possibilities of stock-farming and the introduction of various crops, fruits, and vegetables hitherto unknown in the district occur worth careful consideration. The sweet potato, hopes tartar oats, sulla, clovei, suggest themselves amongst others m this connection. An experiment on a very small scale is being made by the writer with the last two ; but it is not yet time to know with what result. Attention may perhaps be once again called to the apathy which seems to prevail in British commercial circles with regard to the possibilities of this district. Perhaps it has none ; but it seems a pity at ail events not to come and look. Annex 2. » Rainfall and Temperature in Mosul (City).

We obviously cannot assent to an additional burden being imposed on our trade by an increase of the Turkish customs, if that increase is to be employed, either directly or indirectly by setting free other revenues, to facilitate the completion of the Bagdad Railway as at present controlled.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Conversation between Sir H. Babington Smith and M. Bompard on March 30, 1910. I INFORMED M. Bompard that, to our great disappointment, Mr. Webb would not be able to go to Mesopotamia this spring, for the purpose of examining Willcocks’s projects. He found, after reading Willcocks’s reports, that three months at least would be required for the purpose ; and he could not absent himself for so long from his work m London for the Egyptian Government. I said I hoped that he might be able to go at the beginning of the cold weather. The delay was much to be regretted, hut it was impossible to arrange with anyone else, of sufficient competence, at a moment’s notice. M. Bompard said that delay was unfortunate, as in Paris they were anxious to proceed with the matter—especially with the railway, which interested them most. Their desire was to proceed in concert with an English group. I said that Mr. Money, our railway engineer, was already at Bagdad, examining the line between Bagdad and the Gulf. He would return via Hit and Palmyra in order to examine the route recommended by Willcocks. His report would put us in a better position to judge of the railway. The railway could not, however, be treated apart from the irrigation. M- Bompard agreed that the railway could not be contemplated except in connection with the irrigation. I said that I expected to be in Paris early in May ; and that, before establishing closer relations with the French group, I should like to be certain of the attitude of the French Government towards that group. M. Bompard said that that was a question for Paris, but that he had every reason to believe that the group was “ vu d’un bon ceil ” by the French Government. I said that our communications had been mainly with M. Bardac, and with M. Ornstein, who had represented him at Constantinople ; [2707 A—1]2 but that I understood from them, and also from M. Defies, that the Ottoman Bank was behind M. Bardac. M. Bompard at once assented, and said that M. Bardac’s relations with the Ottoman Bank were so close that he would never proceed in a matter of this kind without being sure of their co-operation. M. Bompard said that he understood that the Germans were very near concluding an arrangement for the guarantee of the line as far as Bagdad. Owing to the English condition that the 4 per cent, customs increase should not be used for that guarantee, the Turkish Government had pressed them to give up their lien on the customs for the guarantee as far as Helif. They had cleverly used this to obtain other revenues in substitution, and to apply them to the guarantee not only as far as El Helif, but all the way to Bagdad. I said that my information agreed with his. The revenue which Djavid had agreed to substitute was the surplus of the tithes assigned for the railway guarantees—dating from the year 1331 (1915). M. Bompard expressed the opinion that if this arrangement were confirmed by Parliament, the position of the Germans would be greatly strengthened. H. BABINGTON SMITH.CONFIDENTIAL. Sir E. Goschen to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 10, 8 a.m.) Berlin, April 10, 1910, 1*8 a.m. (No. 25.) R. CHANCELLOR sent for me this evening. Referring to your conversation with German charge d’affaires, he said that he regretted not to have been ab e to fa 1 in with your views respecting Bagdad Railway Pubhc opinion would not allow him to give preponderance of influence on most valuable section of railway without very substantial compensation. What His Maiestv’s Government seemed to regard as such was no compensation at all. It was something tor lurks but nothing for Germany. ^ After listening to my enumeration of advantages to Germany of British participation, he said that they amounted to nothing. I asked him whether he had in ms mmd any compensation which he and public opinion would deem sufficient. His re 5j ^ ^ as t° the eflect that the only way he could make such a great concession palatable to public opinion was to make it form part of a general political under standing such as he had indicated last year. Any other way was impossible. After pointing out once more the difficulties in the way of a political understanding on his lines, 1 said that surely fact that suggestion of British participation had come from Herman side would have a tranquillising effect on German public opinion. He said that, on the contrary, in the first place the Deutsche Bank was not Germany and secondly, much had changed since Cassel’s visit to render German public opinion sensitive with regard to concessions. No one was more anxious than he to have good relations with England,^ but he could assure me that nothing was more certain than that if he gave away this valuable concession for what public opinion would regard as nothing the relations between the two countries would become far worse than ever. Alluding^ to your remarks about Persia, he said that, in his opinion, that was anothei question which should form part of the general political understanding. His views were that British and Russian Governments should renew assurances as to open door; that Germany should engage not to apply for railway, telegraph, or such like concessions in the British sphere, while, in return, Great Britain should give Germany a fair share of supply of material, &amp;c., in any British enterprises under such con cessions. Germany would also ask for equal participation with other third Powders in loans and situations under Persian Government. I also understood his Excellency to say^ that, as regards Russia, Germany would require that line between Tehran and Khanikin should be constructed, and that on completion of that line and the German Bagdad-Khanikin line carriages and trucks from German line should be allowed to run through to Tehran without prohibitory customs dues or other dis advantages. As long as this was not promised—and the matter was almost as important to British commerce as to German—any assurance of the open door was illusory. / &lt; AfiF[This Document is the Property of His Britamio Biajesty’B Government,] BAGDAD RAILWAY SECRET JjCAt'RlOlO It: Dt££i [12136] No. 1. Sir B. Gosehen to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received April 11.) (No. 99. Very Confidential.) Sirj Tip,7'liY) jh'jyv'bL 8 19X0 DURING a visit I paid to Herr Stemrich yesterday, he alluded to the conversation which had taken place between you and the German charge d’affaires on the Bagdad Railway and your suggestion that perhaps some arrangement might be made which would include the Persian question. He said that I knew very well that no one desired more than he did to see good relations established between Germany and England, but that the attacks recently levelled against the Imperial Foreign Office rendered it excessively difficult for the Imperial Government to come to any arrange ments which would entail concessions on their part, particularly if there was no substantial consideration in return to be placed on the German side of the account. The Bagdad Railway loomed very largely in the public mind at present as a purely German undertaking ; speaking for himself, and he had no authority to speak for the Government, he considered that any concession made with regard to the railway would be severely criticised by public opinion, and would be held up as yet another example of weakness in the Imperial foreign policy. I said that surely he recognised that in the case that an arrangement was come to giving us control over the southern section of the line there would be something to show on the German side of the account, as, as you had pointed out to M. Kuhlmann, such an arrangement would facilitate the completion of the wholef line, and place us in a position to give our consent to the 4 per cent, increase of the* Turkish customs dues. Herr Stemrich replied that this might be so, but that he was quite certain, in his mind, that public opinion would not view the matter m that light or see any quid pro quo for what would be regarded as a concession. I replied that if the Imperial Government recognised that the quid pro quo existed and was sufficient it would not perhaps be difficult to educate public opinion and bring it to a proper knowledge of how the matter really stood. He replied that, on the contrary it would be extremely difficult; it was not only the Pan-Germans who were ill-disposed towards the Imperial Government for its management of foreign affairs, but unfortu nately there was a general feeling amongst the influential industrial classes that German interests abroad were not meeting with sufficient support. I asked Herr Stemrich whether I was to gather from his remarks that he considered the present moment inopportune for any conversations with regard to the Bagdad Railway and kindred matters. He said that he would not go so far as that, as it was of course quite possible by mutual consideration of each other’s interests for the two Governments to come to some understanding ; but he had wished to show me that, for the reasons he had given, the Imperial Government had to move very carefully and avoid anything that might have the appearance of concessions to foreign Powers without due compensation in return. He begged me at the same time to regard his observations as confidential, and as merely the expression of his own personal opinions. I would hear the views of the Imperial Government from the Chancellor, who he knew would shortly wish to have a conversation with me on these subjects. As an example of the interest which the public is now taking in the railway question, Herr Stemrich sent me this morning the enclosed article by Professor Wirth, a well-known publicist, whose writings, Herr Stemrich says, are eagerly read by a very wide circle. I have, &amp;c. W. E. GOSCHEN. [2707 1—2]Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from (t Der Tag ” of April 6, Turkish Eailways. (Translation.) MODERN imperialism, it is true, still fights its battles with bullets and bayonets, but to a far greater extent with other weapons such as the export of goods, shipping subsidies, tariff policies, and State loans. Instead of fighting with charger and chariot, it uses steam engines and railway carriages. The Cape to Cairo line paves the way for dominion in Africa. The French are going to encircle Southern Morocco with a railway from Colomb-B^char to the Atlantic Ocean. In the same way Germany, by means of the Bagdad Railway, is to achieve the economic conquest of Asiatic Turkey. And the others show no readiness to be left behind and are trying to make acquisitions of their own or at any rate to rob us of ours. The Bagdad Railway is threatened on all sides. The Lynch concession, it is true, has not been granted yet. Herr von Schoen’s statements and the emphatic utterances of responsible persons in Turkey leave no room for doubt on this point. And yet there can be no doubt that it will be granted. And thus the Mesopotamian sphere of influence is lost to us. The Bagdad Railway with its economic domain becomes like a champagne bottle corked with a beer bung. And still more. An Anglo-American group is planning a new line which will cripple half the Bagdad Railway. The line is to run from Damascus (not from Aleppo as has been stated) via Palmyra to Bussorah. He always wins who gets to the sea first. The new line will, however, be considerably shorter than the Bagdad line when the latter is complete. It will be almost like the segment of a circular arch. And therefore it is to be feared that the Anglo-Saxons will build faster than we. It must be realised how incredibly slowly the Anatolian and Bagdad Railway has been built. We have only achieved a sixteenth of what the Russians did in the same space of time in Asia. Even the leisurely Turks in the last days of Abdul Hamid began to despise us for our snail’s pace. “ Either you have no money, or you are afraid of foreign Powers,” they said. And further competitors threaten us in Northern Arabia. The English want to build a line from Suez to Bussorah and thence on to Southern Persia. One would think that little or nothing is to be got out of the Northern Arabian deserts. The district, indeed, is unfertile and thinly populated. Apart from the line being of no small worth from the point of view of commercial politics and for strategical reasons, large petroleum wells have been bored Northern Arabia. They are the chief reason for the construction of the line. The Standard Oil Company has also a hand in the business then. The Standard Oil Company have also not overlooked Eastern Asia Minor. They are eagerly working a concession for a railway from Siwa to Lake Van, chiefly on account of the petroleum to be found there. The project is a significant indication of the encroachment of American imperialism into the Old World. Recently an entirely new plan of a gigantic nature has been formed, which I heard of quite by chance. The English want to build a railway from the Black Sea to the Persian Gulf. It is impossible to foresee the outcome of this plan.[This Document is the Propoirty of His Briiaaftmc Majestys Gevenmxentl Memorandum of Conversation between Sir H. Babington Smith and Baron Marschall von Bieberstein on March 24, 1910. AFTER various other matters had been discussed, I referred to the question of the .Bagdad Radway. Baion Maischall said that he was now, and always had been, in favour of an agreement with England as regards the Bagdad-Gulf section, since English interests were necessarily piedominant in that region, owing to the extent of her commerce, her position in the Persian Gulf, and the nearness of her Eastern possessions. He'had seen Gwmner’s memorandum of his conversation with Sir Ernest Cassel, and CasseTs letter to Gwmner. He quoted the phrase “ nothing short of absolute control ” from the latter, and said that he thought that condition would create great difficulty. He that participation was a better word than u control, 55 and that a participa tion of 50 per cent, would, in fact, give real control, without offending in the same way the susceptibilities of the Turks as regards spheres of influence. The assent of the Turks was necessary, since, under the Bagdad Convention, the concessionnaires must obtain the assent of the Turks for handing over any part of the concession to another party. I reminded him that it would also be necessary to obtain their assent to the removal of the bar on the use of the Bagdad-Gulf section before the rest of the line was open to traffic. He thought that, if the participation were , limited to 50 per cent., the assent of the Turks might be obtained, though he did not know whether Haggi Pasha’s views were as favourable to such an arrangement as Hilmi’s had been. I said that the matter was in suspense at present for various reasons. It was not a good moment for pursuing the matter at Constantinople ; also we were awaiting the result of Money’s investigations. I did not refer to the objections of the British Government to any scheme involving the acceptance of the kilometric guarantees in their present form. Baron Marschall agreed that it was not a good moment here, since, he said, there were too many irons in the fire—the new Mahsousseh, the Lynch affair, Willcocks and Mesopotamian irrigation, and the Bagdad-Homs Railway, as well as the question of the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section. As regards irrigation and the Bagdad-Homs Railway, Ornstein had explained to him the nature of his schemes, and had endeavoured to convince him that the Bagdad- Homs line would not compete with the German Bagdad line. Baron Marschall did not BAGDAD RAILWAY. SECRET. Section 2. [April 8.] 111887] No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received April 8.) (Ho. 198. Confidential.) Sir, y Confidential.) carried into effect, as he does not ft latter railway. her or not the proposed irrigation schemes are va:: tor the German line the competition of this I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. [2707 h —2]2 accept this, though he did not lay strong stress on the competitive character. He held that heavy traffic, such as grain, from Bagdad and country to the south of Bagdad would find its natural exit in the Persian Gulf, and he did not expect that a Bagdad- Homs-Tripoli line would secure that traffic. He therefore, if I understood him rightly, considered that the Bagdad-Tripoli line would compete, if it competed at all, * not so much with the Bagdad-Mossoul-Alexandretta line as with the route to Bussorah, hut even on this route he thought that water carriage would defeat the railway. He referred in this connection to article 12 of the Bagdad Convention, which reserves to the Bagdad company the exclusive right to “ embranchements reliant le chemin de fer faisant Fobjet de la presente convention a la mer en un point situe entre Mersine et Tripolis de Syrie.” I suggested that this article did not cover a line reaching the sea at Tripolis itself, since Tripoli was not “ un point situe entre Mersine et Tripolis de Syrie; ” but Baron Marschall said that, in his opinion, the definition included the two points specified as the limits. [We had not the exact words before us at the time, but, on looking at them again, I venture to think that the Ambassador’s view is quite untenable. Even if the words themselves admitted of any doubt, the meaning is clearly indicated by the fact that, when the convention was signed, a railway was actually in existence from Adana—a point on the line—to Mersina ; and it was therefore obviously impossible to reserve to the Bagdad company the exclusive right of making a branch from their railway to Mersina.] Baron Marschall said that Ornstein had claimed to represent “ Bardac’s group, including the Ottoman Bank, Cassel, and the Rothschilds.” I said he represented Bardac’s group, and that though I believed the Ottoman Bank had not taken formal engagements, or committed themselves to the detail of Ornstein’s schemes, they were fully aware of what had been done, and there was undoubtedly an understanding that they would take part in the scheme. As regards our position, I thought it well to be frank, and said that there was a general understanding that we would act with the French group as regards irrigation in Mesopotamia, but we were not responsible for the details of Ornstein’s proposals, and, indeed, thought that Willcocks’s projects and estimates required checking by cooler judgments before they could be taken as a basis of a large scheme. The understanding with the French group referred primarily to Willcocks’s irrigation schemes. The railway had been joined with these schemes by the French group, in response, as we are told, to an invitation expressed by the Turks. We were inclined to share Baron Marschall’s doubt whether a railway to the Mediterranean could get much of the export traffic from Bagdad ; but, if the railway scheme ever came to anything, it could only be in close connection with the irrigation schemes, and we should, of course, regard the understanding for common action with the French as applying to it. Marschall agreed that the railway project was necessarily closely united with the irrigation. He added that, notwithstanding the claim that might be based on article 12 of the Bagdad Convention, he did not think that Germany would oppose the Bagdad-Homs Railway. Ornstein, who was, he said, “un pen naif,” had suggested that the Germans should participate in the Bagdad-Homs scheme and give up their Bagdad scheme. He evidently did not treat this suggestion seriously. As regards the attitude of the Turks to the Bagdad-Homs Railway, he thought it probable that they were attracted by the assertion that no kilometric guarantee was claimed; and they would be less favourable to it when they discovered that the arrangement suggested amounted in fact to a guarantee both for construction and working. The general impression I derived from the conversation was that he was strongly in favour of an arrangement for the Bagdad-Gulf section, and much less hostile than I anticipated to the Bagdad-Homs project.

Section 1, A [12167] Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Avril 11.) (No. 197.) ^ r » T * t-jtj . Constantinople, April 2, 1910. ARRANGED to see Rifaat Paslia at his house to-day and told him that I wished to make clear the position of His Majesty’s Government as regards their consent to the 4 per cent, increase of the customs dues, if it was still the intention of the Ottoman Govern ment to impose that increase, as information had reached us that negotiations were proceeding between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company which, if completed, would, five years hence, give to the Bagdad Railway Company the excess of the tithes for the kilometric guarantees, amounting to about £ T. 500,000, for the construction of the final portion from El Halif to Bagdad. Rifaat Pasha made no attempt to deny the existence of the negotiations, but said they had not terminated. He could not see how we could object to the giving of tithes as a guarantee—it was the giving of the 4 per cent, increase about which we had made the reserve. I reminded his Excellency that in the original communication made to your department on the 14th September of last year, requesting agreement to the 4 per cent, increase, the following phrase had occurred : “II est bien entendu que les sommes provenant de cette majoration ne seront point affectees a des entreprises dans lesquolles le Gouvernement Imperial se trouve deja engage, et notamment le chemin de fer de Bagdad.” This obviously had been introduced in order to get over the objections that our goods would be handicapped with the extra 4 per cent, in order to benefit the Bagdad Railway, in fact, that the money would go out of the pockets of British merchants into those of German contractors—a position difficult to justify before our Parliament—and it was obvious that the receipts other than the 4 per cent, should be available and be reserved for works of general ultility and advancement, and should not be used for furnishing exaggerated guarantees, against which we have always inveighed and against which we have endeavoured to protect them. Rifaat Pasha said he was the more surprised at the view of His Majesty’s Govern ment thus expressed by me, because he had recently instructed Tewfik Pasha to ask at the Foreign Office whether there would be any objection on the part of His Majesty’s Government to the ordinary revenues being given as guarantees for the prolongation of the line from Halif to Bagdad, and he had understood from Sir Charles Hardinge that there would be none, and that it was only the 4 per cent, about which we were concerned. Rifaat Pasha then went on to say that our attitude could only be interpreted by the hypothesis that we wished to obstruct the completion of the line and to leave it, as it were, “in mid-air” at Halif. The Turkish Government were committed in principle to Germany as regards the completion of the line to Bagdad, and they could not risk a disagreement with that Power on the matter. He did not, however, state which is the fact, that the military authorities are pressing very hard for the conclusion of the line to Bagdad. I observed that they were committed when funds were available for the guarantees, and these were not available unless the 4 per cent., or their equivalent, were released. The only way in which they could become available was by some satisfaction being given to British commerce, either by some participation in the Bagdad Railway scheme, or by the granting of a concession to us for a Bagdad-Bussorah Railway. This latter, I reminded his Excellency, had, in principle, been approved of by the ex-Grand Vizier, Hilmi Pasha, after consultation with some of his colleagues. To this his Excellency observed that he had not been one of them, and this was the first he had heard of the suggestion. I then briefly recounted to him my conversations with Hilmi Pasha, the conclusion of which was that Shevket Pasha, who had recently returned from Berlin, should speak to Baron Marschall with a view to bringing about some participation of Great Britain in the continuation of the line. I reminded him of the conversations that had taken place between Sir Ernest Cassell and Dr. Gwinner in Berlin, negotiations not broken off, but only suspended. Plis Excellency seemed to suggest that it would be time enough to consider this proposal when the Halif-Bagdad section was completed, and, if necessary, Turkey could build the Bagdad—Bussorah line herself. This, however, is obviously out of the question. In the first alternative, we [2707 l—l]should have no lever left with which to negotiate with the Germans; and in the second, it is clear that they could, once in possession of the line to Bagdad, make their own terms with regardfto the Turkish Bagdad-Bussorah line. I also took occasion to remind His Excellency that Hilmi Pasha, when Grand Vizier, had frequently declared to me that he would never agree to the continuation of the line on the old conditions, to which his Excellency merely observed that Hilmi Pasha was in the habit of giving promises very lightly. But the fact must not be lost sight of that the military element is still supreme, and perhaps makes its influence more felt than it did last autumn. In the course of the conversation Rifaat Pasha, while still suggesting that a British participation with the Germans in the Halif-Bagdad portion would not get over our objections as to the existence of exaggerated kilometric guarantees asked whether, in the event of such a solution being found, we would grant the 4 per cent. ; but pending the clearing up of the misunderstanding referred to, I thought it wiser not to enter on a field which might be fruitful of lengthy discussion, especially as I am not aware as to how far His Majesty’s Government would support a British participation that necessarily involves kilometric guarantees. Finally Rifaat Pasha said that he would refer to Tewfik Pasha’s telegram recording his conversation with Sir Charles Hardinge which he had not at hand, and that he would confer with the Grand Vizier, but in a somewhat desperate tone he added that the only way he could see out of the matter would be to abandon the request for the 4 per cent, increase of the customs dues. It may not be out of place to observe that the entering into arrangements for the completion of the line from El Halif to Bagdad impliedly on the old onerous conditions with the new one, and that too in connection with the 4 per cent., is clearly at variance with what was generally believed to be the intention of their Government last year, namely, not to proceed with the construction of the line beyond Halif, or even Aleppo, unless some considerable modification more favourable to the Ottoman Treasury were brought about.

We understood that the two principal points upon which we were desired to express an opinion were: Firstly, the probable cost of a railway from Bagdad to Roweit, with an alignment parallel more or less to the River Tigris on the right bank ; secondly, the financial basis upon which the capital required for the construction of suen a railway would be forthcoming in London. As regards the * First Point. We are of opinion that the cost of a single-line metre-gauge railway as proposed should not exceed 7,500/. per mile, this figure to include rolling-stock but it would be exclusive of the necessary charges for the expenses of floating the company. &amp; No opinion is offered at the present moment on the most suitable gauge. This^ estimate of cost is considered to be sufficient to provide fully for the construction of a bridge over the Euphrates in the neighbourhood of its confluence with the Tigris, but does not contemplate any other very important engineering works. Excluding a bridge over the Euphrates, the metre-gauge line alone should not exceed 7,000/. per mile. Second Point.—We understood that it might be deemed impolitic to press the Ottoman Government to give suitable guarantees. Although there seems to be good prospect that there should be a fair return upon the capital of the company from the traffic which it would serve, it is considered that, in order to give the company the necessary stability in the London market, there should be something in the nature of a guaranteed minimum return, although it is thought that the obligation under such a guarantee would be nominal. We therefore suggest that the proposal to bring the railway within the scope of the terms appertaining to Indian railways should be seriously considered, and we shall be prepared to interest ourselves in the flotation of a company to be formed on such a basis. We suggest that the following might be taken as a preliminary basis for such a company, viz.:— (a.) Interest on capital during construction at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum to be charged to capital expenditure, as customary. (6.) After the line is opened throughout for traffic, the Secretary of State for India to guarantee interest on capital at the rate of 3|-, or possibly even 3 per cent., according to the exigencies of the money market. Should His Majesty’s Government prefer to give a British guarantee, the guaranteed rate of interest would obviously be lower. In connection with the suggestions for a guarantee from the Secretary of State for India, it may be remarked that to-day’s market price of the India SJ per cent, sterling loan is, say, 95/. 10s. per cent., and of the 3 per cent. India sterling loan 82/. per cent. (c.) Free grant of land from the Ottoman Government for the purposes of the railway. (d.) After the earnings of the railway are sufficient to pay a reasonable percentage upon the capital expenditure on the line, the surplus to be divided as follows :— One-third to the Secretary of State for India ; One-third to the Ottoman Government; One-third to the railway company. We have not been able within the short time at our disposal to fully test financial opinion in the City with regard to the possibility of raising the capital in London [2707 h—3]required for this particular railway on the security of the railway itself. Much would depend upon the backing given by the Governments of Great Britain, India, and Turkey. We, however, consider that the proposed guarantee would ensure cheap construction and economical working, and would give the Governments concerned the most favourable financial results. The estimate of cost given above is only a preliminary one, in the absence of all surveys, and, accordingly, is made with every reservation. But we have had the opportunity of consulting confidentially a leading firm of engineers who are personally acquainted with the country which the proposed railway would traverse, and they confirm us in our opinion that the railway should ultimate prove a financial success. We fully believe that the railway would not only enable British interests to retain their present hold over the trade of Mesopotamia, but that it would largely increase the volume of that trade, and we further believe that the project would be popular in London, not only from a financial, but from an Imperial point of view.

With reference to our official letter of to-day’s date, it may be opportune to anticipate any possible question being asked as to our competence to deal with the matter in question. We have made a special study of railways in India for many years past, with the result that, although we have not done as much as we could have wished, we have probably had more to do with the construction and financing of Indian railways than all the other Indian firms put together. Quite recently we were conducting very important negotiations (suspended for the time being) with the Secretary of State for the transfer of one of the principal State railways in India to a London company, for the formation of which we were to be responsible. _ The total capital outlay on this line amounts to over 15,000,000Z., and the further capital required at an early date for extensions, &amp;c., would have run into another 4,000,000k or 5,000,000k The fact, as we believe it to be, that the Secretary of State for India conducted no serious negotiations with any firm but ourselves, may be taken as an indication as to the view held at the India Office as to our ability to deal with matters of this magnitude.

HIS Majesty’s Government are considering in what manner they can best maintain and foster the long-established British trade interests in Mesopotamia, a region which is likely to become very productive if the irrigation schemes now in contemplation are carried out. If it proves impracticable to secure British participation in the Bagdad Railway concession on favourable terms, His Majesty’s Government will have to consider what alternative courses there are to such participation. They are inclined to think that one of the best plans would be to attempt to secure a concession for a light railway to follow an alignment down the right bank of the Tigris to Koweit via Kut and Bussorah, with the prospect of a junction with a French (or possibly an Anglo-French) line, now under consideration, from Bagdad to Homs and the Mediterranean. His Majesty’s Government have no means of judging whether the Ottoman Government wmdd grant such a concession ; but before entering upon negotiations agreement which would be acceptable to British contractors. In order not to give rise to suspicions in Turkey, the railway company would (while being predominantly controlled by the British group, who would possess a majority of the share capital and be represented correspondingly on the board) terminus for a railway, as ocean-going steamers could enter into the port at all times.

His Majesty’s Government would be glad to know what view Messrs. Ogilvy, Gillanders and Co. would take of such a concession, and whether they would be prepared, and, if so, on what terms, to interest themselves in the undertaking if a concession were obtained from the Turkish Government.

That opinion having been formed, we shall communicate it, together with the agreement in question, to the Governments at St. Petersburgh and Paris, with a view to joint action by the three Governments in the matter as soon as France and Russia have signified to us what stipulations with regard to the railway they will feel called upon to make before consenting to the 4 per cent, surtax. His Majesty’s Government would, at any rate, require to know how the French and Russian Governments desire to arrange the question of the line north of Bagdad before considering any proposals for concessions of any section of that line or for its inter-nationalisation, since, although the British group have pressed us to interest ourselves in the Khanikin branch, our chief object will be gained if we avert foreign control of the line south of Bagdad. The question of the line north of that point has not been touched on in present negotiations. Gwinner’s proposals have, as yet, led to no negotiations between the British and German Governments, although we conclude that the latter know of them. Please inform M. Pichon of the above in substance, and point out that, in view of what immediately precedes, it still remains to gain the assent of the Turkish Government and of the German Government to any arrangement by the financiers, even supposing that arrangement to be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government.

He added that he was ready to consider the proposal favourably, but that, in the event of the Germans being irritated by it, as it was possible they might be, and consequently creating internal and external difficulties here, as was in their power to do, English support and goodwill would become more than ever necessary to Turkey.

Referring to your conversation with German charge d’affaires, he said that he legretted not to have been able to fall in with your views respecting Bagdad Railway. Public opinion would not allow him to give preponderance of influence on most valuable section of railway without very substantial compensation. What His Majestv’s Government seemed to regard as such was no compensation at all. It was something for lurks but nothing for Germany. After listening to my enumeration of advantages to Germany of British participation, he said that they amounted to nothing. I asked him whether he had in his mind any compensation which he and public opinion would deem sufficient. His ieply was to tlm effect that the only way he could make such a great concession palatable to public opinion was to make it form part of a general political under standing such as he had indicated last year. Any other way was impossible. After pointing out once more the difficulties in the way of a political understanding on his lines, I said that surely fact that suggestion of British participation had come from German side would have a tranquillising effect on German public opinion. He said that, on the contrary, in the first place the Deutsche Bank was not Germany, and secondly, much had changed since Cassel’s visit to render German public opinion sensitive with regard to concessions. No one was more anxious than he to have good relations with England, but he could assure me that nothing was more certain than that if he gave away this valuable concession for what public opinion would regard as nothing the relations between the two countries would become far worse than ever. Alluding to your remarks about Persia, he said that, in his opinion, that was another question which should form part of the general political understanding. His views were that British and Russian Governments should renew assurances as to open door; that Germany should engage not to apply for railway, telegraph, or such like concessions in the British sphere, while, in return, Great Britain should give Germany a fair share of supply of material, &amp;c., in any British enterprises under such con cessions. Germany would also ask for equal participation with other third Powers in loans and situations under Persian Government. I also understood his Excellency to say that, as regards Russia, Germany would require that line between Tehran and Khanikin should be constructed, and that on completion of that line and the German Bagdad-Khanikin line carriages and trucks from German line should be allowed to run through to Tehran without prohibitory customs dues or other dis advantages. As long as this was not promised—and the matter was almost as important to British commerce as to German—any assurance of the open door was illusory.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic ^Majesty's Government ] &lt;) t BAGDAD RAILWAY.

I now enclose a copy of my minute to which you refer. Mr. Churchill was in agreement with it, and Mr. Buxton authorises me to say that, so far as he is able to judge from the cursory examination which is all that he has been able to give to the question, he concurs in the views expressed. Yours very truly, H. LLEWELLYN SMITH. Enclosure in No. 1. Minute by Sir H. Llewellyn Smith on Bagdad Railway Negotiations. The President, IF the present negotiations are fruitless, we may, of course, have to cast about for an alternative solution, and I admit that the situation is very difficult and complicated, but, unless there are some considerations which have not been fully revealed to us at the Board of Trade, I see no sufficient ground at present for any substantial modification of the position which we have taken up, as set out in our recent letter to the Foreign Office. Shortly stated, our position is this : We assume as an axiom (which we have no means of criticising) that, for reasons of high policy, means have to be found to prevent the Germans from completing their railway to the Persian Gulf. As they are under contract to build such a railway, there are only two courses possible :— 1. To thwart them by making it impossible for the Turks to supply the necessary funds, or by obtaining a rival concession which will make the German line unprofitable ; or 2. To come to terms (a) with the Germans to obtain from them their concession so far as concerns the southern section of the railway, and (b) with the Turks to modify the terms of the concession in any way that appears desirable. We have no means of judging how far course (l) is permanently possible, but I should doubt if it can be ultimately successful, and it seems likeiy that German influence will at least be strong enough, playing on Turkish susceptibilities, to make it impossible for us to obtain a new concession for a rival line. If this be so (and on this point our knowledge of the situation is necessarily very imperfect) we can only proceed on the lines of (2). (2.) It is, I think, necessary to keep perfectly distinct in our minds the transaction with the Germans and the transaction with the Turks, although there might be considerable advantage if it were possible to conduct the double negotiation simultaneously;— (a.) The Germans can, of course, only put us in possession of what they have to sell, viz., a concession based upon kilometric guarantees. All we can arrange with them is— 1. The terms as to payment or share of control on which they will part with the concession for the southern section ; and 2. An undertaking not to oppose any agreement between us and the Turks to vary the conditions of the concession so transferred. It is obviously useless for us to raise with the Germans the question of kilometric guarantees. On the other hand, it ought, I think, to be clear that, by stipulating with [2684 e—1]the Germans for a free hand to revise the financial conditions by agreement wrth the Turks, we take power (if thought desirable) to di^peuse wholiy or partly wtth k^ o-vn ran tees on our part of the concession. I hardly think that by such a tra ■ t on with the Germans we can be said to entangle ourselves in the system of kilometnc p grantees though, no doubt, the transaction might be so represented by opponents r J unless careMlyhandkd.^^h the Turkg we shouki; p th i„ k , be in a position to put before them an attractive proposal for revising the conditions ol the concession, hut as Mr Mailing’s despatch suggests that a proposal for a British guarantee would be rejected by the Turks, and some guarantee would probably be requisite m order to attract investors, it sterns to me that we shall inevitably come back to a Turkish guarantee or payment of some kind. Sir E. Grey seems to incline towards a scheme foTgwanteeing the interest on capital, and sharing equally m the profits, as against a fystem Of constructional and working “ kilometric ” guarantees. Such a scheme would be materially more favourable to Turkey than the conditions of the existin| &amp;gdad Convention bnt if weighted with a payment to the Germans ol 2,000L per kilometre, the apparent difference in favour of Turkey would not be so great as to make it certain that the Turks would prefer the alternative to the existing system of guarantee which (it must never be forgotten) does at least gratify their national pn e by making them the nominal possessors of the railway from the outset. We have told the Foreign Office that we consider the terms of the existing concelfon Try unsatisfactory,^ imposing an unfair burden on Turkey if t e project fails and discouraging enterprise on the part of the company by handing over the fr s of success to the TTirkish Government. We have ofiered to suggest a revised scheme, and he plan we have had in mind is to cut down the constructional guarantee to a sum nit more than equivalent to the probable cost of construction and rolling-stock and at the same time to release them altogether from the obligation to guarantee leceipts up to 4 500 fr. per kilometre. On the other hand, the Turkish share of the gross proceeds would be reduced to one-half the excess over 4,500 fr. per kilometre. This proposal is of course open to further revision, and it may be that the scheme of a guarantee o P f interest might be substituted for it ^ th e V ^ know about this when we come to negotiate with the Turks, and it at least debatable whether they would regard the alternative as an improvement ^ After all, there is nothing specially vicious in a guarantee being kilometric though the name has undoubtedly become odious through association with the iniquitous terms of the Bagdad Convention. What we have to look at is (1) the total burden on Turkey’s finances ; and (2) the degree to whicli the guarantee encourages or discourages th6 “^^^d^tr^ish guarantee of interest would be a really substantial guarantee supported by definite revenues. Otherwise British financiers would not look aty^ ^ ^ Q re y&gt; s memorandum touches the question of securing that the capital ancl control shall remain predominantly British, if constructional guarantees are admitted the actual capital of the company will be small, and probably held by a few nersons and in any case, I cannot think that there will be any dime y stipulating that the company shall put a definite restriction on the sale ot ^ shares Whether the particular plan suggested for the purpose m the memorandum is the best I should not like to say, bnt the point (which, of course, is of cardinal importance) s one which I do not think need give rise to anx.ety. It is one entirely between His Majesty’s Government and the promoters of the new company, and does not affect the J negotiation with Germany or Turkey. At the proper stage, however, the matter Sh ° U I d n tee aW^note'l have not referred in detail to the suggestion put forward by Mr Stanlev viz that the Germans should be paid off with a lump sum by the lurks derivedfrom a'loan from His Majesty’s Government. Such a loan could not temacle without appearing in the estimates, and giving rise to keen Parhamentary discu sion and I do not think the plan would be acceptable either to Turkish or Geiman sentimeut.

Fact is that the military element, which is all-powerful, is keenly desirous of completing the line. His Excellency denied all knowledge of the application made by me to Hilmi Pasha for a concession for the Bagdad-Bussorah line.

(No. 48.) Constantinople, March 26, 1910. GERMAN Ambassador has been pursuing very active negotiations with Ottoman Government with a view to obtaining definite guarantees for the future for the construction of Halif-Bagdad section, realising that once the Bagdad-Homs Railway is constructed there will be no enthusiasm on the part of the Turks to see Halif- Bagdad section built. It seems that German Ambassador is putting this forward so that our condition for agreement to the 4 per cent, may be complied with. I am informed that his proposals have met with a not unfavourable reception, and it is not improbable that Turkish Govermnent may be tempted to commit themselves to future heavy liabilities in return for an immediate advantage in the shape of 4 per cent. German Ambassador has now left for Egypt and Syria, and will be absent about a month.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Governmfint, ] at Adana, on tne suDject ot tne management of the Mersina-Adana Railway. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. and management of the Mersina-Adana Railway, which may he of interest in the matter of showing how this line is being prepared so as to become eventually part and parcel of the Bagdad Railway when that line shall reach this city. Another point worthy of notice is that there are now three new German locomotives on the line, wdiile there are also some new first, second, and third class Bagdad passenger carriages in daily service. A great part of the rolling-stock, trucks, waggons, &amp;c., are now marked “ Bagdad,” in 1908, but so great has the expenditure been this last year that, on paper, the company should look in a very bad wmy. It seems, however, that this may have been done partly with the view of making the railway look a failure, wdiereby a complete slump in the shares would be caused ; and it is also supposed, perhaps, that British and other shareholders will now sell out at any price—if so, the Germans will get the railway entirely into their hands. Actually, however, the railway has become much improved, and should become extremely important, while it will probably handle a great amount of traffic, thus proving a most paying investment. The recklessly, but perhaps designedly, large expenditure of last year (1909) has been caused principally by a lot of general repairing that has been done to the permanent way—new sleepers have been laid, new embankments made, rolling-stock renewed, &amp;c. Furthermore, two passenger trains are now run daily in each direction, instead of one train per day each way as formerly. The staff has also been increased about 30 per cent., and the men are paid high wages—all this probably increasing^ the efficiency of the service—but it makes a great hole in the year s table of receipts, whereby it might appear, at first sight, that the line had become an extraordinarily expensive and unprofitable concern. &gt; As regards this increase of employes, I can mention that, for instance, the staff at Adana station his been increased from three to six, and the secretary’s office at Mersina, ■which consisted of one employe, now consists of eight. . . In conclusion, therefore, it is my humble opinion that those who rule the destinies of this line at present are obviously eager to get everything completely into their own ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith some details upon the present working It is generally known, I believe, that about 60 per cent, of the shares of the Mersina-Adana Railway are now in German hands, and it is also a significant fact that the present director here is shortly to be replaced by a German. and to the casual observer the whole line appears, although it does not really, to belong to the Bagdad Railway, and the old British rolling-stock and locomotives appear to be rapidly being got rid of. As regards expenses and receipts, the general turnover in 1909 was greater than [2679 o—4]hands, because they foresee that the Mersina-Adana Railway has a great future as a branch line or “ feeder ” of the main Bagdad line, when it reaches Adana. This I myself humbly consider to be perfectly true, and this Mersma Adana line will probably''become, under good management and with plenty of money to back it, a most important and paying concern in the not far distant future. iaYe ’ V, ' n DONALDSON RAWLINS.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

Babinqton-Smith. (Private.) - J ^ Dear Babington-Smith, ^ Foreign Office, March 12 , 1910. 1 AM very much obliged to you for your interesting letter of the 8th February, containing an able statement ol the arguments in favour of accepting Gwinners offer to Cassel. I quite agree that the present moment is not an opportune one for pressing our views at Constantinople about the Bagdad Railway, owing to the chauvinism which has been created by interested parties around the Lynch Concession. It is difficult, however, to believe ^that, when the proper moment comes, any insuperable objection can be raised by the Turks against British interests acquiring 60 per cent, of the total capital of the Gulf sections of the railway. Were there anv apprehensions on the part of Turkey, a clear statement of our intentions should suffice to dispel them, and to show that no challenge to Turkey’s sovereign rights would be involved. All that we want is to maintain and foster, under the protection of the Turkish Government, the trade interests which this country has been developing for over two centuries. The method by which we propose to attain this object is that British investors should hold a certain percentage in a Turkish Railway Company’s share capital, and that they should be adequately represented on the Board of that Railway Company, whose total share capital will revert to the Ottoman Government on the expiration of the Concession. Much will depend upon the attractiveness of the form in which the matter is presented to the Turks. I do not believe that the position of the Germans is quite as strong as you seem to think. The 1903 Concession is bound to call forth increasing discontent as the line progresses and the payment of the annuities for each successive section is exacted from the Turkish taxpayer. My belief is that the Germans are anxious for our co-operation because they realize the strength of our position. They fear that we may get a competing line down the Tigris. Also they probably know of our privileged position at Koweit, and that the terminus can hardly be made elsewhere, and they do not want opposition to their interests in Mesopotamia on account of the political uncertainty which is at present affecting enterprise in Turkey. They realize, moreover, that so long as we are hostile to the project their bonds will not obtain quotation on the Paris market. It is not impossible that, if His Majesty’s Government decline to approve of British participation in the Bagdad Railway unless there is a modification of the Concession, the Germans may give way and agree to suggest a modification to the Porte. Were the Germans to unite with us in such a course it is probable that the opposition of the Turks would disappear, especially if the prospect of the 4 per cent, customs increase were held out to them. The Germans might then stipulate that the whole benefit of such a modification should not be enjoyed by Turkey alone, but should be shared by them, and they could then arrange matters as they liked best. Our objections to the kilometric guarantees remain, and to accept them would expose us to very damaging criticism from the public. It is true that the working cmarantee has been criticized, because it militates against the railway being sufficiently worked to make it pay. It should be noted, however, that in the sections as far east as Mosul the gross traffic receipts may well be under 4,500 fr. a kilometre, as the population is sparse and the traffic would be relatively small, so that the Germans will probably derive their profits on those sections, not from traffic receipts, but from the Government working guarantee. On the other hand, the gross receipts on the Bagdad-Gulf sections would probably exceed the 4,500 fr. per kilometre, and there the Government would not have to pay any guarantee to the Company.^ Why therefore should the Bagdad-Gulf sections be mulcted 2,000/. per kilometre in order to meet the working expenses of the western sections of the line, which must almost certainly be lower than those of the Gulf sections ? As for the construction annuity, we look upon it as altogether in excess of what the actual cost is likely to be. The Committee which examined the question here in [2684 m —l] B1907 stated that, owing to the size of the kilometric guarantees, a profit of 5,000,0001. was expected to be realized by the promoters on the construction alone of the Bagdad^ Railway. Such a Concession would be utterly inconsistent with the interests of I^enclose a short statement showing how the Committee arrived at this estimate of profit, and from it you will see that, while recognizing the substantial nature of the permanent wav, they estimated the cost of construction, including lolling-stock, at 4,375L per kilometre on the first section as against Dr. Gwmners figure of 5,0001., which you quote. We draw our own conclusions as to the disposal of the diftef enemas ^ ^ Gu]f sect i ons . You say, “The cash product of the bonds provided to meet the construction cost is about 8,500L per kilometre.^ If 2,0001 per kilometre is surrendered to Dr. Gwinner in respect of the western portion of the line there will remain 6,500L, and this sum, you urge, will not leave an excessive margin, taking into consideration the gauge and the substantial nature of the line, the provision of rollincr-stock, the cost of terminal arrangements at Bagdad, Bussorah, and Koweit, and of one or more bridges over the Euphrates, and, finally, the payment of interest during construction. , -&lt; j u* I do not think it correct to include m the cost of constructing the Bagdad-built sections of the railway the expense of “ terminal arrangements ” other than stations. It is expressly stipulated in Article 23 of the Concession of 1903 that “ le concessionnaire aura la faculte da construire, d ses frais, des ports k Bagdad, &amp;c. ; and it is provided that there shall be special port dues, which would of course be regulated on such a scale as to cover not only the current expenditure of the port authorities, but also the interest and sinking fund on the original outlay in construction. W ith regard to bridges, so far as I can see, over the Euphrates there need only be one. # .... . , , As to payment of interest during construction, this item need not be very considerable on the Gulf sections, where the engineering obstacles are few. If, as in any case would be necessary, Article 29 were modified, it might be possible to undertake work on all the Gulf sections simultaneously, thus lessening the period of construction during which interest would have to be paid. You do not think that 6,500/. per kilometre would leave an excessive margin after construction; it is impossible to estimate cost with precision in the absence of detailed surveys, but such information as we have does not point to so high a figure. The Committee of 1907, after an examination of all available data, put the cost of the Konia-Eregli section at 4,375/. per kilometre, including rolling-stock; and they fully recognized that the first section was relatively easy and that the line is substantially built. As a fair estimate of the cost on the Bagdad-Gulf^ sections Sir James Mackay, who has some Indian experience, suggested 8 ,000/. a mile (5,000/. a kilometre) ; i.e., 625/. per kilometre in excess of what the first section is believed to have cost. ...... . . „,, So much for the cost of construction. I now take the liability of the Ottoman Government under the Concession of 1903, in so far as concerns the sections from Bagdad to Koweit—a distance of approximately 450 miles, or say 716 kilom. ° The construction annuity yields, to take your figure, 8,500/. per kilometre ; and as the loans, after allowing for discounting-and bankers’ charges, produce only slightly over 80 per cent, of their nominal amount, interest must be reckoned at 5 per cent. The capital sum on which interest would be payable would be 8,500/. X 716, or 6,086,000/. ; and interest at 5 per cent, would be 304,300/., and this amount of interest would be subject to reduction only by_ the operation of the sinking fund, which is spread over the whole period till the expiration of the Concession. The working expenses guarantee is not a fixed charge, but it might at its maximum amount reach 4,500 fr. per annum per kilometre, which works out at 128,8801. a-year. The liability of the Turkish tax-payer in respect of the Bagdad-Gulf sections would thus be interest to the amount of 304,300/., reducible only by the gradual operation of the sinking fund, and, with the working guarantee, it might reach 433,1.80/. . An alternative plan would be the adoption of what, for the sake of convenience, I may term the “ Indian ” system. This could be introduced on the most advantageous basis if His Majesty’s Government were to offer a guarantee of 3 per cent, on the actual cost of construction, which we put up at, say, 3,600,000/. including rolling-stock.the^soveSg^riglrbs 6 ^ that thG TuikS W ° uld regard this P ro P osal as a dereliction of T] ke °^ ie1 ’ f 1 J t f rnat i 1 ve which might be suggested to the Turkish Government is mat they should themselves give a guarantee. In their case it would probably have to e one o per cent., and the guarantee would have to begin from the moment the rr/o rwvfz iec l uiie d for construction. A 5 per cent, guarantee would only amount • p i ’ • a-year, pins, say, 20,000/. in respect of bankers’ profits and discounting, sue i were necessary in connection with the financial operations; and, an important pom , ns ia i ity would not continue for ninety-nine years, but it would cease as soon as the railway realized a net profit of 5 per cent, (a state of affairs which ouo-ht soon to come about in the fertile districts of Mesopotamia); while Turkey, under e n ian system, would share equally with the Railway Company in any profit over and above 5 per cent. “ j r ^ j r Now to contrast the two systems :— Under the Concession of 1903 the Turkish Government might have to pay, as stated above, a maximum amount of 433,180/. Should, however, Dr. Gwinner insist on having 2,000/. of the construction guarantee (viz., 2,000/. X 71G makes a capital sum ot 1,432,000/., which, at 5 per cent., represents an annual charge of 71,600/.) on the Bagdad-Gulf sections, and make arrangements on that basis with the Turkish Government, while the “Indian system was adopted by the British capitalists, the cost to the Turkish Government would be 71,600/. for the guarantee and 200,000/. a-year as the “Indian” maximum, making a total of about 270,000/. The ‘ Indian system has the great advantage that the guarantee really corresponds to the actual cost of construction ; it is a far cleaner plan than the other; it would benefit the Turkish tax-payer; and it would foster and develop British trade, getting us out of what you call the “ perversity ” of the working guarantee, which renders the railway incapable of being worked as a commercial success. If, on the other hand, we accept Dr. Gwinner’s proposal, the Germans will be reaping the lions share of the profits under the 1903 Concession, while we shall merely incur the odium of it, as neither the Turkish tax-payer nor the British public will be able to discriminate the innocent from the guilty of the two parties to the transaction. We are not opposed to kilometric guarantees as a system ; they exist, as you know, in Egypt; what we object to is the scale of the guarantees allotted under the Concession of 1903, imposing as they do, in our opinion, burdens altogether in excess of what is fair upon the Turkish tax-payer. As regards the Bagdad-Homs Railway and the irrigation schemes in Mesopotamia, the French Government are very anxious that British capital should participate in the railway upon which they have bestowed their blessing, and they themselves are equally desirous of par ticipating in the irrigation schemes. If the railway is to he built, we think it very desirable that British finance should participate in the scheme, so as to have a voice in the construction and control of a line which may in the future be of considerable advantage to British trade. The question of the extent of the participation of a British group and other details can be decided later. I understand, however, that the French Government have no knowledge whatever of the Ornstein group, and that the Ottoman Bank is not represented in it. Moreover, the French Government will take good care that no group gets the concession except through them. I may add that they have already announced their claim to a concession for this railway as a condition of the 4 per cent, surtax. In view of my earlier statement that we agree with you that, owing to the prejudices aroused by the Lynch Concession, it may be advisable to postpone temporarily any further pressure to obtain for British capital the construction and control of the Persian Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway, it appears to us that for the present it would be well for British finance to concentrate on encouraging sound irrigation and railway projects, which will cover the ground in Mesopotamia, and so minimize the importance of the southern end of the Bagdad Railway. Believe me, &amp;c. CHARLES HARDINGE. B 2 [2684 m—1]Enclosure in No. 1. Estimate made by the Bagdad Railway Com 1907 respecting the Cost of Constructing the Bagdad Railway. THE Bao-dad Kailway loan, first series, 1903, was issued at 86'40, and, after illowhnr for dfscounting and bankers’ profits, produced about 1,750 0007 This was for a, section of 200 kilom. There are understood to be ten sections between Korua and Bussorah, each of 200 kilom., and the section from Bussorah (Zobeir) to Koweit may be taken roughly at 160 kilom. Assuming that the price of issue of the further loans is the same as the first, the cash yield for all ten sections from Koma to Bussorah should amount to about 17,500,0007, and the cash yield for the 160 kdom. to Koweit may be taken as 1,400,000/., so that the total provided for the line from Koma to Koweit would work out at about 18,900,000/. _ . , , r* + „ It is contended that this provision is largely in excess of what the cost of construc- From /careful comparison of available data, the cost^ of the first section of 200 kilom. would appear to have amounted to 875,000/. for rolling-stock and construction. This sum is composed as follows :— Rolling-stock Construction Total The cost per mile works out:— Ground work Permanent way and stations Rolling-stock f 125.000 750.000 875.000 £ 1.500 4.500 1,000 Total 7,000 which corresponds approximately to 4,3/ 51. per kilometre. To the cost of the first section must be added a sum of 172,0007 spent m /awx frais to Turkish officials and in preliminary surveys over the whole line, it is believed that the backsheesh for the whole concession was defrayed out of the profits on this section. Thus the total estimate works out at 875,0007 plus 1,2,0007, which is 1,04 Thesecond section is looked upon as far the most difficult, involving at any rate some 10 kilom of bridging and tunnelling, besides some side tunnelling and several cuttag® through bed-rock. There are fifty “difficult” and seventy-five relatively easy miles on this section, and the cost has been estimated, though with every reservation, at about 2,768,000/., including 128,0007 for rolling-stock. The third section of 200 kilom. will have to cross the Amanus range (from 2,000 to 3 000 feet high), and though it will, not present such formidable obstacles as the second section, the cost may be put at 2,000,000/ or 10,0007 P^ kilom Ity dtfficffit to estimate with any precision these two sections (the second and third), but 4,/68,0 should he adequate. p , , • There remain seven sections of 200 kilom. to Bussorah, and 160 for the extension to Koweit, or a total of 1,560 kilom. at 5,000/. per kilom., which makes a total of The grand total for construction and rolling-stock for the line from Noma to Koweit thus is estimated at 13,615,000/., which, deducted from the sum of 18,900,000/., leaves a margin of 5,285.000/. # ., ,, , r It is true that this estimate does not take into consideration the paynient ot interest during construction, hut on the other side of the account it does not, wit e exception of the extension to Koweit, take into consideration the numerous branches, the construction of which would show such a profit as would probably more than counter-balance the payment of interest during construction ol the whole line ; so that it seems not too sanguine an estimate to put the probable profit from construction at 5,000,000/. . . , P It should also not be overlooked that under various articles of the concession ofiIjHLD££H_ment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governm,^ .

V\ e are all agreed that the arrangement of the convention is a bad one ; but it exists, and the question is whether it is practicable to carrv through a negotiation ? involving a complete modification of the system of guarantees. ' The position of the Germans is strong. _ They have a convention which the Turks cannot repudiate, and under whicli they will be compelled sooner or later to find the revenues for the guarantee of the whole of the line. It is true that no definite period is fixed, and that the Turks are adepts in the art of delay, but the Germans can afford to wait. ^ Revenues have^ been assigned to provide for the next four sections, and the construction of these sections will take perhaps six years. Before the end of six years the Germans are certain to have opportunities of bringing pressure to bear, or of offering inducements. They have also behind them the fact that the military party here are anxious to see a broad gauge, high speed line carried through to Bagdad and the Gulf. I he Germans therefore have no great reason to be dissatisfied with the prospect for the future, and will certainly not give up their present strong position except for a suitable inducement. You know the position under the existing contract. It is very favourable to the Bagdad Company as regard the amount provided for construction. The cash product of the bonds provided to meet the construction cost is about 8,.000/. per kilometre. This is a large sum, but not so excessive as has often been represented, because (1) the type of line required under the concession is a very solid and expensive one ; (2) in certain sections there is heavy and costly engineering work; (3) the company has to pay interest on capital during construction. On the other hand, the arrangement as regards the guarantee for the working of the line and the division of the traffic receipts between the Government and the company is unfavourable to the company. The Government guarantees an annual ! 2650 o -2]receipt of 4,500 fr. per kilometre, but if the traffic receipts exceed this sum, the who e ot the surolus up to 10 000 fr. per kilometre goes to the Government and the company received nothing more until that sum is exceeded. Any receipts above that amount ^rjivided in the proportion of 40 per cent, to the company and 60 per cent, to the Government. This means that the company has precisely the same sum to meet the working expenses, whatever the traffic receipts may be, so long as the receipts do not exceed^0 000 fr. per kilometre, and that out of the receipts above that sum, the company receives^ only 40 P per cent., a proportion insufficient to meet the additional cost of the additional traffic. The Germans admit the perversity of the arrangement, and say that in order to meet the future charge arising from it, they propose to put aside as a reserve a sum of 2,000Z. per kilometre from the margin on the construction of the easy ^What, then, are the objects of the Germans in proposing British co-operation ? They probably foresee that if British capital does not participate British opposition will grow stronger and stronger as the line approaches the Persian Gulf, buch opposi tion would probably not prevent the ultimate completion of the line, but it would delay it. In the second place, they wish to secure for their guarantee the proposed addition to the customs duties, and consequently they are anxious that there should not be any condition which would exclude this. Thirdly, they would not be sorry to obtain the assistance of Paris and London in issuing the bonds. _ Fourthly, looking furthet into the future, they perhaps think that British co-operation would facilitate the use ot the line for Indian mails and passengers. . , With these advantages in view they agree to cede to British capital a pre ponderating interest in the Persian Gulf section, provided that arrangements are made for them to retain the 2,000Z. a kilometre on which they count. On the other hand, they are unwilling to contemplate any modification in the terms of the concession, even if the modification were such as to leave their prospective profits untouched, since they are of opinion that any negotiation of the kind would be very difficult to carry- through in the present state of affairs, and might endanger the concession m geneial. Cassel brought away from his conversations at Berlin the strong impression that they would not listen to a proposal involving a general modification of the convention, and that the only practicable course was to accept substantially the terms they offered. . i • i • ij The objection which Sir Fdward Grey sees to this proposal is that it would involve accepting the kilometric guarantees, and that this would expose the Govern ment to the charge of inconsistency, and to damaging criticisms in the press and in Parliament. As regards the system of the guarantees under the Bagdad convention, the criticisms which have been made apply specially to the working guarantee. This might with great advantage be modified, and it is worth considering whether we might not dispense with the working guarantee altogether, if the division of the traffic receipts were arranged on a rational basis. I do not at present put this forward as more than a suggestion for consideration. Mr. Money’s investigations will give us the materials for judging whether it is practicable. As regards the construction guarantee, the system is not open to the same criticisms. It merely amounts to a guarantee of interest and sinking fund on the estimated cost of construction, given in the form of bonds. The criticism is that the amount allowed for construction is exaggerated. This may be true, if the easy sections are considered separately and if the 8,5001. remains intact; but if the 2,0001. per kilometre is deducted from the 8,500L, the remainder (6,500L) will probably not leave an excessive margin. Here, again, Mr. Money’s reports will give us a more accurate basis; but taking into consideration the gauge and the substantial nature of the line, the provision of rolling stock, the cost of terminal arrangements at Bagdad, Bussorah, and Koweit, and of one or more bridges over the Euphrates, and, finally, the payment of interest during construction, the cost cannot be low. Dr. von Gwinner has given the actual construction cost of the Konia-Eregli section (a very easy one, with no big bridges) as 5,000Z. per kilometre, without interest, during construction. In any case, it cannot be expected that British capital will take the matter up without a reasonable prospect of profit, and, if it is a condition of obtaining control ot the Bagdad-Gulf section, that 2,000Z. per kilometre should be assigned to the Germans, there is not much room for reduction in the amount of the guarantee. It has been suggested that the British Government might give a guarantee, but the Turks would have the strongest objection to this, and would far rather pay the guarantee themselves. If, therefore, the Government regard it as an object of great importance to obtain\. &lt;x* k ' BAGDAD RAILWAY. /vr- [January 10.] SECRET. 4 'SMAft ip \ \ i /^j \ :^y v v ■■ r’»v»„ -kv it Section 2.

These are very serious objections, which have already been recognised as sufficient to justify His Majesty’s Goveinment m refusing to participate m the Bagdad Railway scheme fn the basis A kilometnc guarantees for construction and working expenses. t is desirahfe to find a solution of the situation created by Sir E Cassel’s negotiation with Gwmner, which at present involves the system of kilometric guarantees with all its faults and objections. ^ iniometric Jhere are three alternatives to kilometric guarantees : (a.) No guarantee at all. (6.) A Britisli guarantee. (c.) A Turkish guarantee. _ Now as regards the question of constructing the line without any guarantee at all it is not possible to express an opinion as to whether such a course is possible or not but I would draw attention to the case of the British Smyrna-Aidin Railway which’ ever since it was constructed in 1856, has been worked without a kilometric guarantee’ Naturally all the shareholders of this line are British, and, although an incomparably poorer country than the Mesopotamian delta is seryed by it, it has paid f good ividend. If Bntish investors were sufficiently enterprising to find capital for the construction of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway, it should not be impossible to find British capital for the construction of the Bagdad section, with all its prospects of irrigation of the adjoining districts. » U1 The second alternative is that of a British guarantee of 3 per cent on the canbol spent on the Gulf section of the line, any earnings above this 3 per cent, being shared equally between the guarantors and the shareholders. This was recommended bv [2577 &amp;—2] ;lji Sir James Mackay at the Bagdad Railway Committee of 1907, and subsequently submitted to the Cabinet. Assuming the distance from Bagdad to the Gulf to be 450 miles, and the cost of construction with rolling stock 8,000L a-mile, the cost would be 3,600,000k, and the annual guarantee 108,000k, the latter to be shared by the I Imperial and Indian Exchequers. It has been stated as an objection to this proposal that the Turks would regard it as a dereliction of their sovereign rights. It would, however, if that were so, be a dereliction for which they would receive good money value, since they would be relieved of some of the onerous conditions of the convention of 1903. I think it not unlikely that they would in the end accept a proposal on these lines if it were put before them, as it undoubtedly could be, in an attractive form. The other alternative which might be suggested to the Turkish Government is that they should themselves give a guarantee. In their case it would have to be one of 5 per cent, on the capital actually expended on the Bagdad-Gulf section, and in return article 35 of the convention of 1903 might, in so far as it relates to this portion of the line, be modified so as to relieve Turkey of both the construction annuity and working expenses guarantee. The gain to the Turkish Exchequer would be consider able, for the following reasons :— The construction annuity, when capitalised, gives a cash yield of about 8,500k per kilometre. From Bagdad to Koweit the distance is about 716 kilom., making the amount payable as interest by Turkey (viz., 5 per cent, on 8,500k X 716, or on 6,086,000/.) 304,300/., and this amount of interest would be subject to reduction only by the operation of the sinking fund, which is spread over the whole duration of the concession. The working expenses guarantee is not a fixed charge, but it might at its maximum amount reach 4,500 fr. per annum per kilometre, which, for 716 kilom., works out at 128,880/. a-year. The liability of Turkey in respect of the 716 kilom. from Bagdad to Koweit would thus, under the concession of 1903, be a sum not exceeding 304,300/. a-year in respect of construction guarantees, and, if the working expenses guarantee were added, it might reach 433,180/. On the other hand, the 5 per cent, guarantee on the capital of 3,600,000/. (which, assuming 5,000/. per kilometre, would be the approximate cost of constructing and financing rolling stock for 716 kilom.) would be only 180,000/., plus, say, 20,000/. for bankers’ charges, &amp;c., if that were necessary, making 200,000/. in all—the maximum annual liability of Turkey, and, which is an important point, this liability would not continue for 99 years, but it would cease as soon as the railway realised a net profit of 5 per cent., while Turkey would share equally in any profits over and above this 5 per cent. It would be almost incredible that she should refuse a modification in this sense. There yet remains the point of the 2,000/. per kilometre which Gwinner demands should be paid to the Bagdad Railway Company from the construction guarantee for the Bagdad-Gulf section. We need not trouble about this, as it should form a subject of agreement directly between Gwinner and the Turkish Government, and need not be in any way connected with our own negotiations with the latter. I he Foreign Office memorandum of the 4th June, 1907, of which copies were given to the French and Russian Governments, represents the attitude which we should now uphold as regards our participation in the Bagdad Railway. There are one or two points in it which might be modified, but, as a wdiole, our policy should remain unchanged. I have noticed in Sir E. Cassel’s memorandum that no mention is made of the ports which are to be constructed at Bagdad, Bussorah, and Koweit. It may be presumed that, if the Gulf section is to be under our construction and control, the building of the ports on that section would be naturally included. It is very desirable that there should be no doubt upon this poiut, and the fact must not be overlooked that we are paying 4,000k a year to the Sheikh of Koweit, precisely in order to control the terminus of the line. It might therefore be as well to stipulate that the terminus should actually be there and under our control. Sir E. Cassel s proposals contemplate a certain proportion of the share capital being in Butish hands ; but no attempt is made to show how this proportion should be pei manently so secured. Ihe following is a suggestion which has been made to me, and which, I think, is worth considering: — Ihe bonds for the Bagdad—Gulf section may be issued to the investing public at, P&amp;r* W e could stipulate that the Bank of England should have the right to buy ti fK Al «\ ■lip any bonds allotted to British shareholders at any time at, say, 105 or 108 per cent or any pr.ce that mtght be considered fair.

SMITH communicated to me this morning a letter from Herr Gwinner, repeating what we already knew that he, Gwinner, and the syndicate had no objection to our receiving a controlling share of, say, &lt;60 per cent, in the Bagdad-Bussorah line, but that there might be political difficulties in the way (I imagine on the side of the German Government), and that objection might be anticipated from Turkey. Turkish objection he must leave entirely to Sir E. Cassel to settle with the Porte, as he can take no steps in the matter. I said we could not proceed further without the views of the Board of Trade and | the India Office, and that we should on receiving these draw up a memorandum ! embodjdng the precise terms which we could accept. This could be read to Sir E. Cassell or Sir H. B. Smith, whoever was available. It would then be for Herr Gwinner | to reply. We are negotiating at rather a disadvantage, and must be careful what we say to Cassel and Smith, for, whilst the German Government know that they are in touch with us and are aware, step by step, of what we are ready to agree to,'Herr Gwinner says he is not in touch with his Government, who will probably make conditions if they accept the financial agreement at all. If Cassel is able to tell Gwinner informally that His Majesty s Government would, he believes, accept such and such terms, Gwinner ought to be able to tell Cassell informally what the German Government would be likely to agree to, otherwise the negotiation is one-sided. In these circumstances, we must be careful in what way we notify our final agree ment to the financiers terms. It could be done in such a way as to safeguard our position. Sir H. B.

It did not appear likely that any suiplus would be available in the near future unless the ceded revenues were augmented by an increase of the Turkish customs, nor was it probable Turkish Government would be induced without the greatest climciilty to pledge other revenues for the benefit of the railway. T 11 ® Turkish Ambassador in London had in November 1908 intimated to His Majesty s Government the Porte’s desire to raise the Turkish customs duties from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent., and he had been informed that the assent ot His Majesty’s Government to that course would only he given if t ley received an undertaking that the proceeds of the increase were not devoted to any existing enterprise. This undertaking, Bifaat Pasha said, Ins Government was prepared to give. The questions of the customs increase and of the Bagdad Bailway had become indissolubly bound up together owing to the lien on the surplus of the ceded revenues secured by the Bagdad Bailway Company. When, therefore, it became evident that the Turkish Government would shortly apply officially for the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the increase of the duties from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent., and as there appeared to be no intention on the part of Germany to invite British participation in any form in the railway, it became a question whether it would not be necessary to use the customs increase as a lever with which, if possible, to bring about a solution of the Bagdad Bailway question satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government. The first idea was tiiat failing the attainment of a satisfactory solution, such as participation in the Bagdad Bail way Concession by securing Tigris Valley m Biitish hands the construction and management of the Gulf section of Railway, the railway, His^ Majesty’s Government should only accept the proposed customs increase if they should receive a Concession for a railway from the 1 eisian Gulf to Bussorah and Bagdad along the valley of the Tigris, with the option to prolong it along the valley of the Euphrates to Tripoli or some other port on the Mediterranean ; the construction of such a line to be carried out without any Turkish kilometric guarantee. This condition was [2577 ee—I] BDjavad Bej, May 27, 1909. Euphrates Valley Bail way. Sir G. Lowther, No. 375, May 25, 1909. of course, to be additional to that already formulated, that the proceeds of the increase should pass to the Turkish Exchequer, and be kept free from any existing lien. At the end of May an official request was received from the Turkish Government for His Majesty’s Government’s assent to the increase by 4 per cent, of the Turkish customs duties. The Turkish Charge d’Affaires’ note alluded to the financial difficulties of his Government, from which relief could only be found by the proposed measure; alluded to the undertaking already given by the Turkish Ambassador that the proceeds of the increase would be kept free from any existing lien; and stated that the German and Austrian Governments had already assented to the increase. At the same time a despatch was received from Sir G. Lowther, enclosing a report from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bagdad, in which the latter advocated, as the most important desideratum of British policy in Meso potamia and the adjacent regions, the acquisition of a Concession for a railway directly connecting Bagdad with the Mediterranean at Alexandretta via the Euphrates Valley and Aleppo. Colonel Bamsay pointed out that the financial regeneration of Turkey is dependent on the development of Mesopotamia; that the progress of that region is held back by the deficient means of communication ; and that irrigation in Mesopotamia and develop ment of railways must go hand in hand together. Assuming that the Bagdad Bailway would some day he built along the trace of 1903, and viewing the matter from the purely commercial point of view, Colonel Bamsay argued that a railway in British hands up the Euphrates Valiev from Bagdad to the Mediterranean through Aleppo would furnish the best means of protecting British interests in Mesopotamia against foreign com petition. The railway from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf he regarded as important, but less important than the line to the Mediterranean. He regarded it as most urgent that the Turkish Government should retain freedom of action and equality of rates for all parties on the Aleppo- Alexandretta section, pointing out that if the German Bagdad Bailway Company were to secure control of this section they could, by imposing maximum rates on goods reaching Aleppo via the Euphrates line, nullify all the advantage the latter would obtain over the Bagdad line by means o*f its shorter length. On this point Sir G. Lowther in his covering despatch, wrote:— “I am not convinced that this apprehension is well grounded. The German Company possesses its preference for the line connectins: Aleppo with the sea only on condition that the prior similar rights of the Damascus - Hamah-Biredjik Bailway are respected ^see Young’s ‘Corps de Droit Ottoman,’ vol. iv, pp. 166-7 and 228). Now, supposing the French Company is willing to cede its right, it seems to me certain that whatever other conditions they mav attach to the Agreement, they would certainly stipulate for favourable treatment in tariff matters for themselves, and in such case it is hard to conceive that the Turkish Government would not insist on equally favourable treatment for any railway starting from Aleppo for which they might grant a Concession. Thus” though no doubt serious, I doubt whether the competition of the Bagdad Bail way would be as formidable as Colonel Bamsay antici pates, especially when the advantage which the Euphrates Valiev line would possess in its shorter route is taken into account.” Sir G. Lowther, however, recognized how desirable it was that the Aleppo-Alexandretta section should be in more friendly hands than those of the Bagdad Bailway Company, and he also pointed to the fact that the French houses interested in Turkish railways do not always adopt the policy advocated by the French Government. * 1 There were thus three alternative schemes towards the attainments of which His Majesty’s Government might turn their endeavours : 1. Participation in the existing Concession in such a manner as to secure to Great Britain the construction and control of the Gulf section of the railway up to Bagdad, and if possible further north to Mosul.$ a f 3 Isof from latter Heso- fora Iretta the TiJff f f 0nstruction °. f a railway from the Persian Gulf to Bagdad via gris, if necessary m competition with the German line- with th.&gt; ranean Sea!

It was not easy to see how the construction of the Bagdad Railway without British participation could he guarded against unless advantage were taken of such opportunities as the increase of the customs duties might offer for making conditions.

In favour of the proposal it could be urged that to connect the customs increase with the demand for a Railway Concession would he dangerous unless His Majesty’s Government were prepared to insist to the last upon the Concession being granted. By such insistence His Majesty’s Government might be placed in an invidious position, and be made to bear the odium of refusing to the new regime in Turkey, for selfish reasons, the means by which the country hoped to regenerate the national finances. On the other hand il His Majesty s Government were to dissociate the two matters, and while accepting the customs increase on easy terms, were to offer to build the Ila , iiwa y without any guarantee, if necessary in competition with the Geiman line, such action would incite the Porte to make endeavours * Memorandum, July 24, 1909 [27901].

It was decided to separate the two questions of customs increase and Arjiisris^Toot 0 ’ P ta ^ wa y Concessions, and Sir G. Lowther was instructed to apply to the ’ ' Turkish Government for a Concession for a railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf via Bussorah and the Tigris Valley, the Concession to be without any financial guarantee from the Turkish Government, and the concessionnaires to have the first option of prolonging the railway along the valley of the Euphrates to the Mediterranean, should the development of irrigation and trade render such a course desirable. After some delay caused by Cabinet changes in Turkey, Sir G. Lowther carried out his instructions in conversation with the Grand Vizier. His Highness expressed himself as personally favourable to the proposal, and said he would confidentially consult his colleagues. He pointed out that the grant of such a Concession would be deeply resented by Germany, and that Turkey would have to rely more than ever on Great Britain to help her out of such difficulties. On the same day the Turkish Ambassador in London communicated to the Secretary of State a Memorandum again pressing His Majesty’s Govern ment to assent to the proposed increase of the customs duties. The Memorandum described the urgent necessity under wdiich the Turkish Government found themselves of increasing their revenues and the various schemes of reforms to which those revenues were to be devoted. It also contained the following assurance:— “II est bien entendu que les sommes provenant de cette majoration ne seront point affectees a des entreprises dans lesquelles le Gouverne- ment Impelial se trouve deja engage, et nommement au Chemin de Per de Bagdad.” The Memorandum handed to Tewfik Pasha, in reply, stated clearly the terms on which His Majesty’s Government would consent to the proposed increase. These were:— 1. Removal of restrictions on the borrowing powers of Egypt. 2. V ith respect to the Bagdad Railway, the following statement was made:— “ His Majesty s Government take note of the undertaking given by the Ottoman Government that, in the event of their assent being given to the levy of an additional 4 per cent, import duty on British trade, the proceeds of this surtax will not be devoted to the Bagdad Rail- tvay. The}' are, however, of opinion that, in order to render this pledge effective, it will be necessary that the Sublime Porte should obtain from the German Government an assurance of their wulling- ness to 4vai\ r e their right to any of the proceeds from the customs increase for the sections of the Bagdad Railway mrw in course of construction or to be constructed in the future. A confidential communication to His Majesty’s Government, that an assurance in this sense had been given by the German Government, would remove one of the principal objections of His Majesty’s Government to the proposed increase, and make it clear that the political promise given by the Porte would not subsequently embarrass relations with Germany.” a ^ oan were ra ised on the proceeds of the increase, at least one- third of it should be placed on the London market, the conditions being equally favourable with those offered elsewhere.

He expressed himself in favour of an arrant 0ct ober n, 1901 ment being come to between the Germans and the English for the con- stiucdon of the remaining sections, and said he had instructed Mahmoud Shefket Pasha to approach the German Ambassador on the subject M. Isvolsky at a later date communicated to Sir A. Nicolson some infor mation he had received to the effect that Hilmi Pasha had really not been favouiably impressed by the British project, though he admitted that it would piobably be pleasing to the Turkish Parliament, in view- of the fact ha no guarantees were required. He had, in order to block an exclusively British pioject, suggested to the German Ambassador whether the German Railway Company would not be disposed to form a combination for the BaL 86 MaLf n -f 1 w 7 i'’ 11 ! 1 Z 1 ' 611011 and En S lish concessionaires. Baion M, rscliall said that he had no objection to such a combination, piovidea that no further difficulties were raised in regard to the Boulgourlou- 4i i_ section.^ He would he prepared in such circumstances to recommend the combination which Hilmi Pasha suggested. In October Sir W. Willcocks arrived in Constantinople from Mesopo tamia, and, m an official report to the Minister of Public Works, advocated in the strongest terms the construction of a railway from Bagdad to Hit Hamascus, and Inpoli as the best means of developing Mesopotamia. On reaching London later on he explained his views and reasons for advocating the Hit line to Sir C. Hardmge, and, though His Majesty’s Government saw no reason to alter the attitude they had adopted in the matter two months earlier, it is possible that Sir W. M illcocks’ strong support of this project may have disposed the Bagdad Hailway Company to British participation by presenting to them the possibility that His Majesty’s Government mi Hit be compelled to throw their whole weight into the Hit line. While in Constantinople, Sir W. Wiilcocks informed the Turkish Government in writing that the irrigation works proposed in Mesopotamia might m five or ten years’time have the result of making the Euphrates and Tigris rivers non-navigable. This statement had a serious effect on the Lynch negotiations then pending, and the possibility contemplated made it tue . mo . re ur gent for His Majesty’s Government to secure adequate partici pation in the railway schemes of Mesopotamia. ^. n ^ ie October the Grand Vizier informed His Majesty’s Charge a Affaires that the Germans were willing to admit British participation “on the basis of equality of representation on the Board,” and a w'eek later [2577 ee —1] q Sir A.

Mr. Marling, No. 346, Teleg'raphic, October 31, 1909Dr. Gwinner approached Sir H.

Cassel to come to some arrangement with the German Com pany and Sir H. Babington Smith had a conversation with Dr. Gwinner, m which the latter stated that he was prepared to agree that the Bagdad- Persian Gulf section of the railway should be under British control The precise nature of Dr. Gwinner s offer vas not known to His IVtajestys Government till the end of the year, when Sir E. Cassel, after interviews with him at Berlin, communicated a Memorandum stating the conditions on which the Bagdad Kailway Company would admit of British participation in the enterprise. Dr. Gwinners proposals were essentially as follows. 1. That the provisions of the existing Bagdad Kaihvay should be maintained practically unaltered. 2. That a new Company, in which Great Britain should have a 50 per cent, interest, should be formed for the construction and w orking of the Gulf section. An interest of 30 per cent, was reserved for the Bagdad Kailw r ay Company, 10 per cent, for the Anatolian Kailway Company, and 10 per cent, for the Turkish Government. 3. That out of the construction loans attaching to the Gulf section, a sum representing 2,000/. per kilom. should be ceded to the parent Company. 4. That the consent of the Turkish Government be obtained to the arrangement. Dr. Gwinner stated that it wms the wish of the Grand Vizier that British participation should not exceed 50 per cent., and that the Bagdad Kailw r ay Company wuuld not object to Great Britain having a preponderating influence. He also said that he had verbally informed the Turkish Govern ment that his Company would not insist on the application of the proceeds of the 4 per cent, increase to kilometric guarantees beyond series 2 and 3 (i.e., as far as Hilif). Negotiations with Germany, Russia, and France. Germany. To Sir E. Goschen, No. 266, October 28, 1909. No negotiations have taken place with the German Government during 1909 about British participation in the Bagdad Kailway ; but in a discussion of the general relations of Germany and England the Secretary of State took the opportunity of explaining to the German Ambassador why His Majesty’s Government w r ere unable to assent to the increase of the Turkish customs duties without a promise that the proceeds w T ould not be devoted to the Bagdad Kaihvay. About one-third of the increase of the duties would fall on British commerce, and this in itself wmuld be much disliked. But if the money thus secured at the expense of British trade w r as to be used to make a new r through-route to the East and to establish means of communication which w r ould supersede all others in carrying trade from the Persian Gulf into Mesopotamia, and all this under the exclusive control of one foreign Pow r er, then the position of a British Government which had agreed to this would become untenable. It was therefore impossible for us to agree to the increase of the Turkish customs duties unless w r e had proper safe guards against the use of the additional revenue for the purpose of displacing British trade in Mesopotamia. We felt that we must either have a part in the Bagdad KaiDvay itself, or else w r e must have a Concession which would enable us to establish other means of communication by w 7 hich we could trade w T ith Mesopotamia on equal terms.

Cassel and Herr Gwinner might come to a satisfactory agreement, as far as , ie commercial interests involved in the question was concerned, but, as he would have me to understand, it did not follow that the Imperial Government would see their way to confirming such an Agreement, at all events at once. He did not wish me to think that the Government had any objection to British participation, because that was by no means the case. But public opinion in Germany would he up in arms and make things very unpleasant for the Imperial Government unless the latter could show that there / was some return for what they would certainly regard as a Concession. The so-called Lynch monopoly wculd add fuel to the .me, and there would certainly he a universal cry that German interests were being sacrificed with nothing to show on the credit side of the account.” In replying to this despatch, His Majesty’s Government took strong To Sir E. exception to some of the views expressed by Herr von Schoen. Sir E Goschen Gosehen, ^o. 7. was instructed to point out that the advances in the matter of British Jam,ar y 10, 191 participation had proceeded from the German side, and that— “ the suggestion that the German Government regard British partici pation in the light of a Concession, and that some quid pro quo will be required from the British Government in return, in order to make the arrangement acceptable to the German people, is one ir which His Majesty’s Government cannot entertain.

Nothing more will have been accom plished than what will have been essential to prevent that long- established interest from being crushed out by new developments.” Russia. On the 15th November the Report of Sir H. Babington Smith’s con versation with Dr. Gwinner was received in London, and on the 18th November His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh was instructed by telegraph to communicate its substance to the Russian Government, and to ascertain their views as to participation in the Bagdad Railway. In the telegraphic correspondence which now ensued the action and views of His Majesty’s Government were made clear to M. Isvolsky. He was informed that no negotiations had as yet proceeded with the German Government, and that nothing but unofficial conversations between German and British financial groups bad taken place ; that the German Ambassador in London had been told that in any agreement over the Bagdad Railway French and Russian co-operation must be invited; that the control of the Gulf section was the minimum which His Majesty’s Government could accept in any settlement, and the acquirement of that minimum was rendered the more pressing by the possibility that irrigation would destroy the navigable character of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. M. Isvolsky was informed that the British group had pressed to have control of the Khanikin branch as well, but that His Majesty’s Government had considered Russian interests involved, and had refrained from supporting the proposal. It was obvious that the Bagdad Railway would be built, with or without British and Russian co-operation, and a decision was urgent ; meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government were in ignorance of Russia’s views as to participation. Though His Majesty’s Government would certainly raise no objection to negotiations between Russia and Germany as to participation in the railway north of Bagdad, they trusted the Russian Government would keep them informed of their , progress, and they could not remain indifferent if any Concessions were made by Russia to Germany in the neutral zone of Persia. M. Isvolsky’s first impression was distinctly unfavourable, but he was brought to recognize the loyalty of His Majesty’s Government in the matter, and to view the matter in a calmer and more rational spirit. On the 28th November Sir A. Nicolson wrote as follows:— “ His present attitude may be summarized as follows : He considers that the proposals of M. Gwinner constitute an entirely new departure; he does not question the right of the British group or of His Majesty’s Government to accept them, and he expects that eventually they will do so ; he fully appreciates the loyalty of His Majesty’s Government in so promptly informing him of the pro posals, and of abstaining from accepting immediately proposals which are so eminently satisfactory to British interests. He regards an arrangement between England and Germany on the basis of the proposals of M. Gwinner as dispelling any expectation that the Bagdad Railway will be discussed between Germany, England, France, and Russia. It will necessarily amount to an arrangement between Germany and England, by which the latteralUnterest ’ihp ^ th f so ' thern f ection &gt; a “d return abandon Merest m the line to the north of Bagdad.

Had he been able to have the continuation of British co-operation l? a lhese i ne &amp;°tiations he would be more hopeful of their Success. 16 c I onsiders ’ 18 already in a sense a partner in the Bagdad Railway, and, moreover, her interests in the proiect are small in comparison with those of Russia. He has at present, so far as I aye been able to ascertain, no definite views as to the basis on which he would endeavour to obtain a Russian participation in the rai way. I do not think that he so much desires an actual partici pation in the railway; he rather wishes to assure himself that ermany will not endeavour to push railway enterprise in those portions of lersia m which Russia possesses direct and immediate interests In what manner he may secure such assurances he is not at present very clear, but he is well aware that in order to do so he will probably be obliged to offer Germany a quid pro quo. Of what character such a quid pro quo will be he does not know, nor is he decided as to the quarter in which he could find it. I do not think that he would consider himself precluded from seekino 1 it in the neutral zone of Persia, but he will keep His Majesty’s Government informed of the progress of his negotiations with Germany when ever they may be commenced. Personally, I doubt if M. Isvolsky would be inclined to admit Germany into the neutral zone of Persia. M. Isvolsky’s policy with regard to the Bagdad Railway has always been a negative one ; and it is easy to understand how difficult it must be for him to state in what manner the Russian Government would participate in a i ail way the construction of which they would prefer to see indefinitely postponed. The reply of the Russian Government to Sir A. Mcolson’s Sir A. Nicolson. inquiries as to their views brought matters no further forward. It did, No. 6*77, however, contain assurances that His Majesty’s Government would be kept December 27, informed of the course of negotiations with Germany, and that the Anglo- 1909, Russian Convention with regard to Persia would be strictly observed. Unable to formulate any scheme providing for Russian participation in the railway, and fearing that a settlement of the Bagdad Railway question in which Russia received nothing would react unfavourably on the national prestige, on his own position, and on the Anglo-Russian entente, M. Isvolsky expressed the desire to come to some understanding with His Majesty’s Sir A. Nicolson, Government over railways in Persia, providing for the possibility of linking No. 632, up the Russian and Indian railway systems, or at any rate, for earmarking December 1,1909. Concessions for railways with that object. His views on this point, however, have not yet been fully developed, and the idea is still being examined by the British and Indian Governments. &lt; Hie position at the end of the year and the course of action which His Majesty s Government contemplated adopting was stated in telegrams to Sir P. Bertie and Sir A. Nicolson as follows To Sir F. Bertie, No. 743, “ As far as we are concerned, position is as follows : Gwinner’s overtures Telegraphic, led to negotiations with Cassel, which may result, but have not yet 30, resulted definitely, in an offer to British financiers of assured control ^ of construction and working of railway from Bagdad to Gulf. “ When financiers agree, His Majesty’s Government will have to con sider whether arrangement proposed would justify them in agreeing to increase of Turkish customs dues without condition. I should then let Prench and Russian Governments know what the agree ment between financiers was and what was our opinion of it before taking any step. It would then be for Prench and Russian Govern ments to let us know what conditions as regards Bagdad Railway [2577 ee —lj Dwould ensure their consent to increase of Turkish customs dues, so that we may all act together. “ Questions of internationalisation and of any Concession of parts of railway north of Bagdad have not come at all into negotiations between British and German financiers, and we should await views of French and Bussian Governments as to how these points should be dealt with before raising them. Essential point for us is to ensure that railway from Bagdad to Gulf does not pass into foreign hands, though British financiers had expressed to me desire to secure interest in Khanikin branch also. “ Assuming that terms agreed between Cassel and G winner are found satisfactory by His Majesty’s Government on this point, it would still remain to be ascertained whether German and Turkish Govern ments would agree about them. No negotiations have as yet taken place between us and German Government about Gwinner’s proposals, and we assume only that German Government know of them.” Sir F. Bertie, No. 455, November 20, 1909. Sir F. Bertie, No. 470, December 1,1909. “ Times,” December 29, 1909 [47321], To Sir F. Bertie, No. 38, January 22, 1910 France. The French Government were kept fully informed of all the negotiations which passed with Russia, and the views and intentions of His Majesty’s Government as explained to M. Isvolsky were all communicated to them. From the first M. Pichon expressed himself as well satisfied at the prospects of a settlement which Hr. Gwinner’s action presented. He informed Sir F. Bertie that he fully recognized the necessity for Great Britain to secure her political and commercial interests in the Persian Gulf by acquiring control of the southern section of the railway, but that French public opinion would certainly require that France should receive some quid pro quo for her consent to such an arrangement, and that he would study what form of com pensation would be most suitable. On the 27th Becember M. Piehon took an opportunity to explain to the French Chamber the attitude of the French Government. A deputy (M. Constant) quoted the words of M. Belcasse in 1902 : “ If a solution had been found in viitue of which the Russian element would be at complete liberty to participate in the enterprise, and by virtue of which the French element would possess, as regards the construction, working, and general direction of the line, a share in all respects equal to that of the most favoured nation, I ask the House whether a solution of this kind would not be one upon which we should have reason to congratulate ourselves.” Asked by M. Constant whether he would associate himself with this statement, M. Pichon immediately replied, “ Certainly; I make these declarations my own, and I include the British as well as the Russians.” He went on to say that the French Government always had been and still were in favour of internationalising the Bagdad Railway; that the recent formation of a syndicate in Switzerland to continue the construction of the railway beyond Boulgourlou as well as the participation of the Ottoman Bank in the enterprise was without the sanction of the French Government, who looked for a settlement of the whole question on the basis of an equitable co operation of the various States concerned. On the 13th January the French Ambassador, who had had con versations with M. Pichon in Paris, communicated the views of the French Government as to participation. M. Pichon foresaw that there would be great difficulty in obtaining Turkish assent to British control of the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway, and was therefore in favour of inter nationalisation of the whole line. He realised, however, that this scheme offered but few attractions to His Majesty’s Government, and in the event of their adhering to the present project, he had decided that the French Government would demand— 1.

Yon should inform his Excellency that I am obliged to him foi his very frank explanation of the attitude of the German Govern ment towards the participation of His Majesty’s Government in the construction and control of the Gulf section of the line, although it is somewhat disappointing to learn that even if an agreement were arrived at between the financiers, which was acceptable to His Majesty’s Government, the German Government might find it difficult, at any rate at the present time, to confirm it, owing to the opposition which is to be anticipated from German public opinion. You should remind Herr von Schoen that, so far as His Majesty’s Government are aware, it was Herr Gwinner who first approached Sir E. Cassel on the subject of British participation, and that the initiative in no way proceeded from the British group, still less from His Majesty s Government, who have made no move in the matter since the discussions which took place at Windsor in November 1907. When His Majesty’s Government were first informed that Herr Gwinner had made overtures to the British group, they assumed that the German Government were not unaware of the proposals which had presumably been put forward, after due consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of British participation. The German Government are aware of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the present discussion. Should an agreement be arrived at by the Germans which is in all respects satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, they would be perfectly willing to sanction participation, after due discussion with the Governments of France and Russia, and they would welcome the conclusion of an agreement on a question which has been long outstanding, and which has, they fear, occasioned some soreness of feeling between the two countries. But the suggestion that the German Government regard British participation in the light of a concession, and that some quid 'pro quo will be required from the British Government in return, in order to make the arrangement acceptable to the German people, is one which His Majesty’s Government cannot entertain. His Majesty’s Government consider that any advantages which may accrue to them from participation in the railway wull be more than equally shared by Germany, especially when it is remembered that the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the increase of the Turkish customs duties by 4 per cent, would follow upon the conclusion of an agreement, thus imposing for the advantage of the Bagdad Railway, which has a lien upon the customs revenue, an additional burden upon the foreign trade of Turkey, of which such a large proportion is British. Public opinion in this country would, it may safely be said, welcome an agreement with Germany on equitable lines, but any attempt on either side to obtain special advantages or to overload the agreement with extraneous questions might over-reach the mark, and, far from improving the feeling between the two countries, react injuriously upon the harmonious relations now existing between the two Governments. As Herr von Schoen has mentioned the Lynch concession, it may be as w^ell to explain to his Excellency that this question seems to be the subject of some misunder standing in Germany. British vessels were accorded the right to navigate the Euphrates and Tigris by firmans of 1834 and 1841, and a company was formed by Messrs. Lynch in 1802 for the purpose of navigating these rivers. Ever since that time this firm have maintained their steamers on the rivers. The present negotiation merely relates to the amalgamation of Lynch’s concession with the Turkish Hamidie Company, and the transformation of wdiat has been an entirely British concession for so long a period into a Turkish company in which Lynch has a share. No new r rights have been acquired. On the contrary, Mr. Lynch is surrendering rights which he has enjoyed many years, and is amalgamating his interests with those of a Turkish company.

[2577 fc—1]It is also to be observed that the contemplated participation of British interests m the Bagdad Railway is not an advantage additional to the Lynch concession, but may possibly impair that concession, and at any rate will be in the same region. Even^v the new Lynch concession were granted and a participation of British interests in ti Bagdad Railway admitted, Great Britain would only have a controlling interest in means of communication in which this country has for a long time had a vested interest through the Lynch steamers.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in Ro. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Marling. Observations on the Bases of Negotiation proposed by Dr. A. von Gwinner to Sir E. Cassel for British Participation in the Bagdad Railway Concession. THE bases proposed by Dr. von Gwinner are really four in number and in essentials are the following 1. That the provisions of the existing Bagdad Railway shall be maintained practically unaltered; 2. That a company, in which Great Britain should * have a 50 per cent interest, shall be formed for the construction and working of the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section ; 3. That out of the construction loans required for those sections a sum repre senting 2,000Z. per kilom. shall be ceded by the new company to the Bagdad Railway Company, which provision necessarily implies that the former (or British) company will not abandon the Turkish Government’s guarantee for the interest on these loans; and 4. That the consent of the Turkish Government be obtained to the arrangement. Looking at the question from a purely local standpoint it is safe to say that if these are to be the bases on which British participation in the Bagdad Railway is to be brought about, they will arouse the greatest mistrust and opposition in Turkey, and it may be predicted with confidence that the Turkish Government will refuse to sanction the scheme. In the first place the formation of a “ British ” company to take over the Bagdad Gulf sections will he regarded as another step taken to advance British designs on Mesopotamia ; at the best we might succeed in clearing ourselves of the accusation of cherishing schemes of territorial aggrandisement, and be arraigned only on the minor count of seeking to partition out Turkey into spheres of influence, but even this would be scarcely less galling and oftensive to the Turks with their newborn ideas of national independence. To the more enlightened Western mind these suspicions seem ludicrous enough, and it might be supposed that it should not be difficult to disabuse the Turks [2577 r —1] Bmm 11 ! li’ni i I ! f //O .’fHB of»», ^ *» £v;rjd”i;r,s prricrs thu th.t they should eu.st «ud th.t th™. who hold »• f ia h , ars^2iSi“hS .

The Minister of Finance, it may also be mentioned, has told several Eng is nen s lately that the rumours th tit the 'negotiations were proceeding on these lines were ^^ex^thCTlTs^hrqlestitn outlie guarantees. If the stipulations of the existing concession are to be maintained, as the memorandum implies, ^ will enjoy guarantees both for the interest on the construction loans and for the workino- expenses. What will be the effect of such a proposition on the Turks . To say the leas P t of it, we should in their eyes stand convicted of the most flagrant incom sistency. Not only has the embassy, under instructions sounded the Porte as to the grant of a concession for a railway (to compete with or be a substitute foi the German Bagdad line), without guarantees of any kind, but we have made a condition of our assent to the increase of the import duties that the product of such increase shall not be applied to new railway guarantees, and in the subsequent negotiations we have never concealed, or rather we have openly avowed, that our object in doing so was to block the Bagdad Railway. We have in fact, both as a general principle and in specific instances, steadfastly set our faces against the whole system of kilometric guarantees and yet we are now being asked to claim them for ourselves m respect of a section of railway against the completion of which we have been consistently and strenuously workmg forbears pastes vo lt e .f a ce will be worse than inconsistency — it will be treachery. There has been much wild talk by unauthorised persons of our benevolent intentions towards Turkey in connection with this matter, and public opinion believes that our opposition to the Bagdad Railway is at least as much inspired by a wish to relieve the country of a burthensome engagement as by the necessity of defending our own interests, both commercial and political, m those regions. It we were now to accept Dr. von Gwinner’s proposal that we should the Bagdad Bail wav Convention as it stands, would not the Turks conclude that our opposition had been purely factious, inspired by chagrin at being excluded Irom a “share in the plunder,” while naturally their suspicions as to our designs on Meso potamia would be redoubled ? The case would even be worse than this lor we should presumably ask for the cancellation of that part of article ^9, whic stipu lates that, so long as the main line between Konia and Bagdad is not complete, no part of the Bagdad-Bussorah section that may have been built may be opened lor traffic. Now this article was framed at the desire of the Turks, so that, so lar IrOTi obtaining any modification of the existing conditions in their favour, we should e asking them to forego one of their own desiderata. In these circumstances what shred of credit for disinterestedness would be lelt us with the Turks ? What chance could there be of their consenting to the arrangement contemplated ? _ _ But the question also demands examination from the German side, rrom wha has been said above, it is pretty evident that our acceptance of Dr. von Gwinners bases involves the gravest risks for our credit here—a contingency so eminently pleasing to the Germans as to provoke the conclusion that Dr. von Gwinner must have had that object in view when he formulated the proposals made to Sir Ernest Cassel. On the other hand, it must be remembered that we have always consistently harped upon the necessity of protecting our position in Mesopotamia, and it is quite conceivable tha Dr. von Gwinner made his overtures on these lines in good faith. It would, however, be idle to pretend that he and the German Embassy here are not quite alive to the loss of credit and influence which must result to us should we consent to negotiate on the proposed bases.It is also worth while considering what the effect of abortive negotiations on these lines would be on the prospects of the completion of the Bagdad Railway by the Germans alone. It is safe to say that they would be improved, for the Turks would be ^Jhspose to discount our opposition as merely selfish and not based on any belief in the in erent demerits ol the scheme. At present we hold a strong position, but as time E? eS oul P 0 ® 1 ! 1 ® 11 18 likely, so far as can be seen, to grow weaker rather than stronger. e eimans, tor instance, are still sufiering from the odium of their profitable intimacy with the old regime, but this will gradually diminish. Again, it is doubtful how long we cou c maintain our veto on the application of any new customs duties to railway guaiantees, or rather, how long such veto will be effective, as the Ottoman Government may in a few years be able to supply the required sum from the surplus revenues of the ‘ Alette , while it must further be remembered that our strongest weapon of all—the P**^ d, 1^ quote Bagdad Railway shares on the Paris Bourse—is in the hands of the r rench Government, and circumstances might arise in which it might feel constrained to authorise the quotation. If, then, the bases proposed by the Germans for our participation in the enterprise are in all probability impracticable, and certainly involve some considerable risk, the question arises whether some combination is not feasible, and of the many that have been sketched the three following seem to be the best worthy of consideration :— The first is that we should participate on satisfactory terms in the Bagdad Railway as a whole. It may be possible that some arrangement could be found to effect this, but at first sight the objections seem to be insurmountable. In the first place, the Germans are, it is understood, opposed to are to escape the charge of inconsistency as the financial interests of Turkey would have not agree. the proposal; and in the second, if we above explained, radical modifications in to be made, to which the Germans could The second combination is the project advocated by Mr. Edwin Whittall, and, like the former, would have the inestimable advantage of conciliating British and German interests. His proposal, of which an outline hastily prepared by himself is enclosed, is briefly that, instead of carrying on the railway from its present head at Bulgurlu with the normal gauge, a narrow gauge line should be built on the existing trace with branches northward to Samsoon and north-east to Erzeroum, thus opening out the whole of Asia Minor. Mr. Whittall gives figures to show that the total annuities payable under the existing Bagdad Railway concession by the Turkish Treasury as kilometric guarantees on construction loans would suffice to provide the capital required for the whole of this narrow gauge system, and he argues with much force that the change of gauge is not really a matter of importance. The undertaking would be “ internationalised.” His memorandum, however, though brief, explains the outlines and arguments in favour of the scheme with so much clearness that it may safely be left to speak for itself, but it is necessary to point out the circumstances which militate against it, viz., that the Turkish staff is strongly opposed to the change of gauge; that the scheme has been coldly received by Dr. von Gwinner; that there would be great difficulty in fixing the respective proportion of control, &amp;c., among the Powers interested; that the Turkish Government seems to be already in treaty with a Franco-Russian group for the projected Samsoon-Sivas Railway, which would have to be incorporated in the new system; and that it is doubtful whether the Russian Government would view with approval a proposal which would bring the frontier fortress of Erzeroum into communi cation with the rest of the Empire. The third alternative is for an English or Anglo-French group to obtain a concession for the railway advocated by Sir William Willcocks from Homs to Bagdad, and thence to Bussorah and the gulf without guarantees of any kind whatever from Turkey. The difficulties standing in the way of realising this scheme are great. It would of course encounter the most strenuous opposition from the Germans, who would regard it as a declaration of renewed war, and who might be expected to play to the utmost on the Turkish superstition concerning our Mesopotamian designs; it may, however, be anticipated that their efforts in this direction would not meet with so much success as usual as the prospect of seeing Syria and Mesopotamia hnked by railway would certainly prove an attractive bait to the Arab and Syrian parties, to say nothing of the inducement held out to the nation at large in the shape of a railway which without any financial burthen on the Treasury would do for it nearly all that the German Bagdad scheme promises at an enormous cost. But there is another obstacle, viz., the difficulty of finding the requisite capital for the undertaking, except under a guarantee from His Majesty’s Government, and acmarantee from His Maiesty’s Government would, if publicly known (as pointed out m No: 946, of the 5th prove fatal to the chances of the concession being passed by the Ottoman Parhament On the other hand to keep such a transaction secret or to veil it so as to be moliensive V Turkish sX’tibihtL P seems almost impossible, so it remains to be seen whether s group could not be formed to finance the scheme without a guarantee. The commercial prospects of the line as a whole are intimately connected with the development of Mesopotamia under irrigation, and it may be taken for granted that if Sir William Willcocks’s predictions as to the future of that country are but half fulfilled the line under discussion would eventually prove highly remunerative. The Lussorah-Bagdad section, however, would probably do something more than pay its way from the very start and would certainly be immediately benefited by the ^ irrigation works, and it is by no means inconceivable that the Porte, in view of the immense advantages which the scheme as a whole offers, might be induced to allow that section to be built first. In that case the promoters of the railway would be getting some return_ on their invested capital for a few years, during which it might be expected that the irrigation works would have made sufficient progress to make the financial success of the western part of the line a certainty in the very near future. . The concessionnaire company would of course have to enter into an engagement to complete the Bagdad-Homs section within a reasonable time, but always provided that the Turkish Government on its side carried out the irrigation schemes with due &amp; But even in these circumstances, it is evident that it will be no easy matter to find a group of capitalists able and willing to invest a large amount of capital without any guarantee, and with the prospective profits, considerable as they probably would be, dependent on the capacity and energy of the Turkish Government to execute and work a large and complex scheme of irrigation. In London the interest taken m lurkish affairs appears to be so languid that a purely British group -even if it were esira e—• is probably an impossibility, and if co-operation is to be sought it will probably be^most easily found in Paris among the financial houses in relation with the National Banx. In spite of these difficulties it would, it is suggested, be our best policy to make the acquisition of a Homs-Bagdad—Gulf Hallway concession our immediate^ objective, and to decline Dr. Gwinner’s proposals. If we can secure it, we should realise all our aims—except that of conciliating British and German interests in Turkey—we should have a fair opportunity of bringing about the fusion of British and French financial interests, which M. Pichon’s recent speech in the Chamber _ shows would be welcome m Paris, and we should be in a position, while satisfying Bussia, to safeguaro our monopoly of transit trade vik Bagdad to Persia. Moreover, the Homs-Bagdad-Gulf scheme is the one which apparently has caused the greatest misgivings to the Germans, and there is everv prospect that if we made it our avowed policy to carry it through, the Germans would accept any reasonable terms that we might formulate in our own and Turkish interests as a condition of our participation in the Bagdad Badway. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Whittall. A Solution of the Bagdad Railway Question: Broad Lines and Objects of the Scheme. A CHANGE from normal gauge to narrow gauge (1‘05 metre) of the w 7 hole railway system from Bulgurlu (the present terminus of the line) to Bagdad and on to the Persian Gulf, and the extension of this narrow gauge system by a new line from Alexandretta on the south, to the Black Sea, at Samsoon, on the north, and to Erzeroum on the east, thus opening up the whole of Asia Minor. 2. The transfer to this extended narrow gauge system of the total lump sum which would have been payable to the Bagdad line under its present convention in annuities for the service of construction loans. 3. An equitable and satisfactory regulation of the kilometric guarantees per kilo metre for working expenses. 4. A change in the conditions regarding curves and gradients, speed, &amp;c., and also with respect to the division of the gross receipts over the minimum guaranteed so as to permit of the concessionnaire company always receiving at least 50 per cent, thereof.Proposed Narrow Gauge Lines. 1,320 kilom. Hence the total length of the whole of the proposed lines would be about Length of lines (obligatory) under the present Bagdad Convention, to which annuities and kilometric guarantees have been assigned :— J-vrl JLXd/Ut5k&gt;il L(J xjLifc/JppO El Helif to Mosul Mosul to Bagdad Annuity Payable by Turkey on the Construction Cost of the above 2,500 kilom. Normal Gauge Line under the Terms of the Bagdad Convention. The ninety-nine year annuity, guaranteed to the Bagdad Bail way Company for interest 4 per cent, and sinking fund (•087538) on the loans accepted and taken up by them in payment for the construction of the line, is fixed at 11,000 fr. per kilometre constructed. Hence the nominal price to be paid by the Turkish Government in scrip at par for the construction of each kilometre works out at 269,111 fr. It follows therefore— That the annuity payable by Turkey on the 2,500 kilom. (2,500 kilom. X 11,000 fr.) is 27,500,000 fr., and therefore that the sum payable by Turkey in scrip at par for the construction of the 2,500 kilom. (2,500 kilom X 269,111 fr.) is 672,777,000 fr. As, however, under present circumstances, with the Paris and other European markets closed, a 4 per cent, loan could not probably be placed with German under writers at over 80 per cept. of the par value, it follows that the actual sum which would be realised in cash from the scrip delivered by Turkey in payment of the construction cost would be 269,111 fr. x 80 = 215,289 fr. per kilometre, or 538,222,500 fr. for the whole 2,500 kilom. Repartition of the above found Annuity of 27,500,000 fr. over the 3,600 kilom. of the Proposed Enlarged Narrow Gauge System. This same annuity of 27,500,000 fr. divided over 3,600 kilom. would yield 7,639 fr. per kilom. An annuity of 7,639 fr. capitalised on the basis of 4 per cent, interest and '087538 sinking fund would yield 186,880 fr. Bagdad to Bussorah .. Sadige to Khanikin ..

Comparative Capital in Cash to be Provided by the Turkish Government for Construction per kilometre under the two Schemes. Under the Bagdad convention 2,500 kilom. normal gauge, 215,289 fr. per kilom. Under the extended system 3,600 kilom. narrow gauge, 156,045 fr. per kilom. With the above data before us we can the more easily look into the financial aspects of the new project and compare it, both from the point of probable construction piofits and also eventual working results with those which may be expected from the present Bagdad concession. . . This is essential, for we could not ask Germany to accept so serious a ^modification of a concession already secured unless we can show her that her material interests would not suffer. .... It must be understood that there is no pretence that the estimates given herein, or the figures on which calculations are based, are correct. They are as nearly so as a rough study can render possible. In the same way, the comparative mileages are only approximately estimated by rough map measurements. They should be quite sufficiently near the mark, however, to permit of fairly reliable deductions and comparisons. Comparative Construction Profits. The conditions under the Bagdad convention as regards curves and gradients, &amp;c., as well as the high minimum speed stipulated for are factors which seriously increase the cost, and therefore reduce the profits to be earned on the construction contract price of 215,289 fr. per kilometre. Further, the unfavourable division of the gross receipts over 4,500 fr. per kilo metre, though it may not be felt for many years to come, is undoubtedly a consideration which ought to be provided for by some sort of reserve fund to be taken out of the original construction profits. We shall probably be not far from the truth if we put down the average cost of 2,500 at 140,289 fr. per kilom., and the average profit to be made on the construction at 75,000 fr. per kilometre. From this profit we must deduct at least 10,000 fr. per kilometre for the reserve fund immediately above referred to, leaving 65,000 net fr. profit per kilometre on 2,500 kilom., or in all (65,000 x 2,500) 162,500,000 fr. The cost of the Bagdad convention normal gauge line is estimated above at 140,289 fr. per kilometre. The saving in cost between such a line and a narrow gauge line under normal conditions has been put down at about 20 per cent, or (on 140,289 fr.) 28,062 per kilometre. This gives us a comparative figure of 112,227 fr. as the cost per kilometre of the narrow gauge line. The sum available for construction of the 3,600 kilom. has already been shown tc be 156,045 fr. per kilometre. Hence the probable profit on the 3,600 kilom. of narrow gauge line would be :— Per kilometre. Fr. 156,045 112,227 43,818} ' ' Under the extended scheme, the conditions as to curves and gradients speed &amp;c., will be less costly, and a working basis of 50 per cent, of the gross receipts v ovei the guaranteed minimum will render it unnecessary to place any part of the ^instiuctLon pronts into reserve, as in the case of the Bagdad convention. We have tried to show in the preceding lines that the probable profits on the construction or the 3,600 kilom. narrow gauge system would be on a par with those estimated to result from the present normal gauge line. Let us now compare the two schemes from the point of view of the probable results to be derived from the actual working of the lines. Under the Bagdad convention the Government guarantees an average minimum of 4,500 fr. per kilometre of gross receipts. Anv deficiency has to be paid to the company at the end of each year in cash. All gross receipts over 4,500 fr. up to 10,000 fr. average per kilometre go to the Government. Over 10,000 fr., 60 per cent, goes to the Government, 40 per cent, to the company. This implies that when the receipts average 10,000 fr. the company will have to work the line, cover all the expenses, and make their profit (?) on 45 per cent, of the gross takings ! Over 10,000 fr., the company’s margin for working expenses and profit becomes still further reduced. This is the eventuality which necessitates the putting aside as a reserve fund of 10,000 fr. out of the construction profits, previously referred to. The proposal under the new scheme is that the Government’s guarantee minimum of gross receipts for working expenses should be reduced to 4,000 fr. average per kilometre on the 3,600 kilometres. That the gross receipts over 4,000 fr. up to 8,000 fr. should go to the Government, and that any surplus gross receipts over 8,000 fr. should be divided equally between the company and the Government. In this way the company would always have a 50 per cent, minimum of the gross receipts for working expenses and profit. Would the exploiting company be a loser by the change from 4,500 fr. for normal gauge to 4,000 fr. for narrow gauge ? No; for the cost of working and upkeep, including interest on rolling stock and depreciation, would be fully 500 fr. less per kilom. for the narrow gauge line. Would the Turkish Government be a loser or a gainer by guaranteeing 4,000 fr. over 3,600 kilom., as compared with 4,500 fr. over 2,500 kilom. ? Undoubtedly a gainer, as whether the gross receipts are above (1), or below (2) the guaranteed average minimum. 1. Under the new scheme the Government receives the surplus over 4,000 fr. from 3,600 kilom. of line, whereas in the Bagdad convention it receives the surplus over 4.500 fr. on only 2,500 kilom. of line. The advantage is clear. 2. Let us consider the case of the average receipts over both systems being only 3.000 fr. per kilom. The Government would have to pay the company at the end of the year under the Bagdad convention 4,500 fr.— 3,000 fr., i.e., 1,500 per kilom., 2.500 kilom. X 1,500 fr. equals 3,750,000 fr. Under the new scheme the result would be that the Government would have to pay 4,000 fr.—3,000 fr., ie., 1,000 fr. per kilog. or 3,600 kilog. at 1,000 fr. equals 3.600.000 fr. Thus on a very low r basis of tbe average gross receipts the cost to the Turkish Government under the two schemes would be almost identical, whereas on any higher average there would be increasingly handsome advantage in favour of the extended project, together with a much more rapid reduction of liabilities assumed by the Government. Lurther, the concessionnaire company itself would in no way suffer. It will be argued that the narrow gauge system breaks the continuity of the through line from Constantinople to Bussorah ; that the change of gauge at Bulgurlu would interfere with through traffic, entail delays and extra expense for transhipment, and, lastly, that a double supply of rolling stock will be necessitated. At first sight these objections may appear to be really serious, but a careful study of the actual conditions will soon dissipate this fear. A glance at the map will show that the Taurus constitutes, so to say, a trade water shed south and north. All produce must inevitably trend towards the nearest seaport, and the nearest port to the consuming centre must receive the imports. The southern Taurus and all the eastern trade must find its outlet and inlet by the Mediterranean or Persian Gulf, and the northern Taurus trade by Smyrna or the Marmora. ^ i p i m No through goods traffic worth speaking of can ever exist from south of the laurus to north, nor from north to south. The change of gauge, therefore, at Bulgurlu could not have any serious con-senuenoe commercially in that nature has already laid her veto on a through goods sequence commercially m thrnncrh military or passenger traffic, which: traffic.

Would it not then be much more rational that the Sle network of railways east of Konieh and Bulgurlu, comprising north- eaL™ southern and eastern As'ia Minor Mesopotam.a and Arabia, shou d ^ narrow saus'e The western Asia Minor line would remain normal gauge. It tl e s g BusSrah line were built normal gauge there would be a much more serious break of continuity at the junction with the northern and southern narrow g au ge hne wi e main Him of normal gauge. Natural conditions seem to have marked out Bulgurlu as th ® the riar ' ow gauge S y S tem would best be at Alexandretta, a port in everv wav suited for the central dep&amp;ts, repairing shops, &amp;c. _ The western normal gauge lines have already their own rolling stock sufficient for their requirements. The eastern narrow gauge network will in like manner possess. ltS ° H^nce the break of continuity at Bulgurlu in the Constantinople Bussorah line would be rather a sentimental than a real obstacle. 'vr r . T , It could not interfere with a through goods traffic which never would exist. Nor would the necessity of a separate rolling stock be of any draw-back or ^tra expense We have so far tried to tabulate and explain away the objections which might be advanced against the new scheme. Its evident advantages are more easily grasped. 1 Turkey would secure the opening up of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia by one connected system, north, south, and east. The commercial strategical, and political importance to the Government, and to the people is incalculable. It would be attained free of any extra cost to the nation beyond the engagements already assumed under the Bagdad convention. Agriculture and commerce would take rapid strides. The increase of the strides and of the customs receipts would be a net profit to the nation, and rapidly help to swell the revenues. And lastly the opening up of the rich districts of Asia Minor would bring about much more rapidly than with t e present Bagdad line, the increase of the gross receipt which eventually will relieve the nation of the kilometric annuities and guarantees already incurred under the Bagdad convention. The strategic and administrative importance of the scheme is too manliest to necessitate our dwelling upon it. Communication will be established by rail from west to east and south and north, and to the farthest corners of the Empire. 2. We have shown that Germany would not suffer financially either as regards construction profits or on the eventual working of the line. . , . The clauses and conditions of the Bagdad convention would be applied m their entirety to the new system, save in respect to the modification which naturally follows from the change of gauge and to the modifications which are suggested herein, re division of surplus plus receipts, &amp;c. i r The unification under one management and control of the whole network ol railways in Asiatic Turkey and Mesopotamia must be of the highest importance to Germany. ... „ „ , i 3. The enlarged scheme would render a settlement of participations tor Bnglanci and France much more easy, and put an end to international jealousies. 4. An arrangement could be come to with Bussia, under which she takes an interest in the Sivas-Samsoon section. 5. Even if an arrangement with England were come to regarding the present Bagdad concession, it is practically certain that Turkey would long delay granting the kilometric guarantees for any extension of the line beyond El-Helit (Mardin). But if the commercial and strategical benefits of the new scheme were put in the balance, it would be so manifestly to her advantage that she probably would willingly make the necessary financial sacrifices.. ■-y, - / II 1 !: 1 —— : a l is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] cr6 i: ! v ^''x BAGDAD RAILWAY.

The English capitalists are making large purchases of land in Schatt-el-Arab and mid-Mesopotamia. The larger part of the land purchased consists of date plantations, the cultivation of which is to receive great impetus from the English action. Several large purchases have already been made, and recently the immense lands of the influential landowner of the province Bussorah—Zuhehir Zade Ahmed Pasha—have passed into English hands. These systematic purchases are beginning to be regarded here in the light of a serious danger. The valis of Bussorah and Bagdad have been instructed to discourage the.sale of lands to foreigners.

Enclosure in No. 1 . Eocti act from the Frankfurter Zeitung' of January 8 , 1910. [2577 r—3]Memorandum by Sir Ediuard Grey {communicated privately to Mr. Winston Churchill). I CANNOT help feeling that we should he careful not to he dragged into the vortex of kilometric guarantees, as established by the convention of 1903, and that it is necessary to put our foot down at once to prevent ourselves being placed in a hopelessly false position in relation to our declared policy of the last few years. Were we to accept any scheme of co-operation in the Bagdad Railway which included participation by this country in the kilometric guarantees under the convention of 1903, it would he almost impossible to defend our action in Parliament against the attacks which would undoubtedly be made on it both there and in the press. There have already been indications in this sense in the press. To put the matter very briefly, there are, under the convention of 1903, two forms of kilometric guarantees :— 1. A 99 years’ annuity to be capitalised and devoted] to the construction of the line and the provision of rolling stock ; and 2. A guarantee for the working expenses. The construction annuity is fixed at such a figure as to far exceed the cost of building the line and the supply of rolling stock, and to leave large sums for allocation, thus encouraging extravagance and fraudulent finance, as exemplified in the first section. The guarantee for the working expenses is not conducive to the encouragement and development of traffic, since, owing to the terms in which the concession is drawn up, the most favourable situation for the company, from a financial point of view, would be that there should be the smallest possible amount of traffic, or, better still, none at all. This brief outline is sufficient to show that the extension of the system of kilometric guarantees is very injurious to the interests of Turkey, since it involves mulcting the Turkish tax-payer of sums largely in excess of the actual requirements, while it tends to restrict the development of traffic on the line. These are very serious objections, which have already been recognised as sufficient to justify His Majesty’s Government in refusing to participate in the Bagdad Railway scheme on the basis of kilometric guarantees for construction and working expenses. It is desirable to find a solution of the situation created by Sir E. Cassel’s negotiation with Gwinner, which at present involves the system of kilometric guarantees with all its faults and objections. There are three alternatives to kilometric guarantees :— {a.) No guarantee at all. {b.) A British guarantee. (c.) A Turkish guarantee. Now as regards the question of constructing the line without any guarantee at all, it is not possible to express an opinion as to whether such a course is possible or not; but I would draw attention to the case of the British Smyrna-Aidin Railway, which, ever since it was constructed in 1856, has been worked without a kilometric guarantee. Naturally all the shareholders of this line are British, and, although an incomparably poorer country than the Mesopotamian delta is served by it, it has paid a regular and continuous dividend of 6 per cent. If British investors were sufficiently enterprising to find capital for the construction of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway, it should not be impossible to find British capital for the construction of the Bagdad section, with all its prospects of irrigation of the adjoining districts. The second alternative is that of a British guarantee of 3 per cent, on the capital spent on the Gulf section of the line, any earnings above this 3 per cent, being shared equally between the guarantors and the shareholders. This was recommended by [2577 /&lt;—2]cv T iv/r 1 of -Raprlad Railway Committee of 1907, and subsequently &amp;r James at the ^dietaBce from Bagdad to the Gulf to be 450 m s, and the cost of construction with rolling ^tock W a-mile cost would and tbe annual pmarantee 108,000L, the latter to De snarea oy in^ Imperial and Indian Exchequers It has been stated as an objection to this propose ttofthe furkB would regard it as a dereliction of their sovereign rights. It would, Wever if that were so, be a dereliction for which they would receive good money value since they would h relieved of some of the onerous conditions of the convention If 1903 I think it not unlikely that they would m the end accept a proposal on these bnes if it were put before them, as it undoubtedly could be, in an attractive form. Thl other alternative which might be suggested to the Turkish Government is that they should themselves give a guarantee. In the “ S Gulf s'n andT of 5 per cent, on tbe capital actually expended on the Bagdad bruit section, ana m return article 35 of the convention of 1903 might, m so far as it relates to this portion If the line be modified so as to relieve Turkey of both the construction annuity and workingexpenses guarantee. The gain to the Turkish Exchequer would be consider- able, for the following reasons The construction annuity works out at 7001. per annum per mile and is a fixed charo-e for 99 years. From Bagdad to Ivoweit the distance is about 4o0 mi es, - fore the annual charge to Turkey for 99 years would on this account amount to ,001. multiplied by 450, that is to say, 315,000L a-yeai. . . ^ The working expenses guarantee is not a fixed charge but it might at its maximum amount reach 2901. per annum per mile, which, for 4o0 miles, works out at 130,5001. a ' ye The liability of Turkey in respect of the 450 miles from Bagdad to Koweit would thus, under the 1903 convention, be a minimum annual amount of o15,000b, and migiit reach 445,500b each year. On the other hand, the 5 per cent, guarantee on the capital of 3,600,000b (which, assuming 8,000b per mile, would be the actual cost of constructing and financing rollino- stock for 450 miles) would be only 180,000b, the maximum annual liability of Turkey, and, which is an important point, this liability would not, like the other, continue for 99 years, but it would cease as soon as the railway realised a net pro of 5 per cent., while Turkey would share equally in any profits over and above this 5 per cent. It would be almost incredible that she should refuse a modification m tins sensG. • i There yet remains the point of the 2,000b per kilometre which Gwinner demands should be paid to the Bagdad Railway Company from the construction guarantee lor the Bao-dad-Gulf section. We need not trouble about this, as it should form a subject ol agreement directly between Gwinner and the Turkish Government, and need not be m any way connected with our own negotiations with the latter. The Foreign Office memorandum of the 4th June, 1907, of which copies were given to the French and Russian Governments, represents the attitude which we should now uphold as regards our participation in the Bagdad Railway. There are one or two points in it which might be modified, but, as a whole, our policy should remain unchanged. , „ I have noticed in Sir E. Cassel’s memorandum that no mention is made ot me ports which are to be constructed at Bagdad, Bussorah, and Koweit. It may be presumed that, if the Gulf section is to be under our construction and control, the building of the ports on that section would be naturally included. It is very desirable that there should be no doubt upon this point, and the fact must not be overlooked that we are paying 4,000b a year to the Sheikh of Koweit, precisely in order to control the terminus of the line. It might therefore be as well to stipulate that the terminus should actually be there and under our control. . Sir E. Cassel’s proposals contemplate a certain proportion of the share capital being in British hands ; but no attempt is made to show how this proportion should be permanently so secured. The following is a suggestion which has been made to me, and which, I think, is worth considering :— The bonds for the Bagdad-Gulf section may be issued to the investing public at, say, par. We could stipulate that the Bank of England should have the right to buy up any bonds allotted to British shareholders at any time at, say, 105 or 108 per cent., or any price that might be considered fair. This would leave us free from any active intervention in the concession unless, for some political reason, such intervention copy i# ForeignIHtT Do( !ggiE:i: i ^ ie Property of His Britanmo Majesty's GorcrajEeatj BAGDAD RAILWAY. SECRET. % [814] No. 1. Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—{Received January 8.) (Secret.) Si r &gt; 4 Board of Trade, January 7, 1910. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your secret letter of the 29th December, transmitting copy of a letter from Sir E. Cassel with a memorandum of conversations between Herr von Gwinner and Sir E. Cassel with respect to the Bagdad Railway. In their consideration of the proposals made by Herr von Gwinner, the Board have had the advantage of receiving additional information from Sir IT. Babington Smith; and they desire me to offer the following observations for the consideration of Sir E. Grey 1. The Board are strongly of the opinion that the limitation of the British share in the railway south of Bagdad to 50 per cent, would be insufficient, or at least would be considered by critics in this country to be insufficient’to secure the undoubted and complete control by British interests which they regard as essential, and that an effort should be made to induce the Turkish Government to consent to an extension of the British share to at least 55 per cent., and if possible to 60 per cent. They understand that Herr von Grwmner would have no objection to this course. Should the Turkish Government be unwilling to consent to the proposal, the same end might perhaps be achieved by transferring the proposed 10 per cent, interest of the Anatolian Railway to the new National Bank of Turkey, an Ottoman institution with predominant British control. 2. In view of the considerations urged by Herr von Gwinner, and the fact that the proposal appears to be acceptable to the British financial interests concerned, there does not appear to be any objection to the proposed payment to the Bagdad Railway Company out of the kilometric guarantees of the sum of 2,000L per kilometre. In the opinion of the Board it w T ould, however, be preferable, if possible, that the subsidy payable by the Turkish Government in respect of the new line should be reduced by the agreed amount, and a corresponding increase made in the amount payable by the Turkish Government to the Bagdad Railway Company in respect of the construction northward of Bagdad. This would be a matter for arrangement with the Turkish Government, but it seems desirable that the financial clauses of any agreement which may be made between the British and German groups should be so worded that, whilst ensuring that the Bagdad Railway should receive the increased subvention, the channel through which it should be paid should be left open. Hie adoption of the course suggested above would avoid giving the impression that, on the one hand, the British enterprise is insisting on a subvention from the Turkish Government which is admittedly excessive having regard to the cost of construction of the Persian Gulf section, and, on the other hand, that it is directly subsidising German enteiprise in Asia Minor. • -n 3. The Board hope that, in any arrangement made with the German group, it will he clearly understood that the Germans will raise no objection to a subsequent agreement between the British group and the Turkish Government foi the vaiiation of the concession in certain important points, e.g. : (a) Abrogation of the article in the existing convention which prohibits con struction southward of Bagdad until the railway has reached that place from the north; (6) A variation of the route at present indicated ; and (c) A variation of the character and gauge of the railway. 4. The Board hope that it may he found possible to arrange that any railway that maybe made to Khanikin should join the main line at Bagdad itself, and not at a point further north. , . „ ^ ^ i If it should be found necessary in order to obtain Russian consent to the proposed arrangement to agree to Russian construction and control of this branch line, the [2577 ft—1]conditions on which such control should be admitted appear to want careful con- sMera bn One necessary condition would seem to be that working agreements as to sicieration. une nece p m p e arrived at between the Russian and rates of charge on the r . danger of British trade with Persia by the^. British companies, m order to obviate any &lt; &amp; ; •. t f Russian trade wiw new route being handicapped by heavy charges to the advantage oi Russian trade with PerSi 5 b h*iinancMLrangements under the existing convention, whereby the Turkish Government is bound to pay an excessive constructional subvention and is to receive ^ return an unduly high proportion of the gross receipts, are, m the opinion of the Board very objectionable. These arrangements impose an altogether excessive burden onlhe Turkish Government in the event of the line being unsuccessful through had management or otherwise, while, on the other hand, they leave the company with little “r no inducement to vigorous and efficient management, since nearly the whole of the fruits of success are allotted to the Turkish Government The Board therefore suggest that it would be highly desirable, in the interests both of the new company and of the Turkish Government, for the former to consent to take a smaller guaran ee on condition that the latter should receive a smaller proportion of the gross earnings. This would, of course, be a matter for direct negotiation with the Tiirkish Government itself, and at the proper time the Board would be prepared to offer definite suggestions as to the modifications which seem to them desirable.

Gwmner had indeed expressed his readiness to make what could only be regarded f concessioIls on the part of the Bagdad Railway Company, but that no agreement had been come to between M. Gwinner and Sir E. Cassel, as there were points which would lequire serious consideration and possibly further negotiation. Count Benckendorff enquired what procedure would be followed in the event of Sir E. Gassel coming to terms with M. Gwinner, and Sir G. Hardinge replied that he supposed the German Government would then inform His Majesty’s Government that the Bagdad Railway Company were ready to allow participation by a British company on certain terms, and would ask whether His Majesty’s Government would approve. The reply would then probably be that before answering, France and Russia must be consulted, or that, much as His Majesty’s Government approve the terms, they would like to learn how France and Russia were to be satisfied. It was made clear to Count Benckendorfi that once the financiers had come to terms, His Majesty’s Government would not in any case bind themselves to accept those terms without consulting the French and Russian Governments, and discussing the terms which they also might make with Germany. Count Benckendorff appeared satisfied with this statement. He had seemed to fear that, because Sir E. Cassel s mission to Berlin was approved, whatever agreement was arrived at with M. Gwinner would be binding on His Majesty’s Government. Sir C. Hardinge also remarked that, although an agreement might be arrived at between Great Britain and Germany, that agreement would also have to be accepted by Turkey, and he anticipated that there might be considerable objections on her part to the proposed solution.

Petersburgh, December 27, 1909. x^^ OI i our transmit herewith copy of an aide-memoire which M. Isvolsky handed to me yesterday, and _ which is a reply to various communications which, by your direction, I have from time to time made to him in regard to the discussions between the -British and German financial groups respecting the Bagdad Railway M Isvolsky explained to me that this memorandum must not be considered as an exhausive statement of the views of the Russian Government, but merely as prelimi nary observations. The memorandum carries the question but little further forward, and leaves the views of the Russian Government still in the region of conjecture. It seems to me that the Cabinet oi St. Petersburgh has been in full possession for sonm weeks past of the nature of the proposals made by the German group, and that their enquiries as to the memorandum of 1907 have in reality little bearing on the new development which has recently taken place. I had hoped that M. Isvolsky would have been able to have given some geneial indication as to the conditions on which the Russian Government would wish to participate in the railway, and it would have been of especial interest to have known on what basis he proposes to negotiate with the German Government. I wdil endeavour later to ascertain whether he is willing or able to give some further enlightenment on this point. M. Isvolsky read to me a letter and a telegram which he had received from Count Benckendorff reporting what he had gathered of the results of the mission of Sir E. Cassel, and also giving the substance of a conversation with M. Paul Cambon, who had related to him what Hilmy Pasha had said to M. Bompard at Constantinople. M. Isvolsky enquired of me whether I had received any information on the latter subject. I replied that M. Louis had been good enough to acquaint me with the statements of Hilmy Pasha. M. Isvolsky said that the question seemed to be confused, as if the Turkish Government were really to oppose any bisection of the line the proposed arrangement between the German and British groups might have to be considerably modified. I beg leave to enclose copies of the pro-memorid, and of the communications from me to which reference is made in the Russian aide-memoire. I have, &amp;c. A. NICOLSON. Inciosure 1 in No. 1.

IT will be within the knowledge of the Imperial Government that some weeks ago an application was made by Sir G. Lowther to the ‘Sublime Porte for a railway concession for a line to connect the Persian Gulf with Bagdad via the valley of the River Tigris ; and it was at the same time asked that the option should be granted to connect the Mediterranean Sea with Bagdad by a prolongation of the above-mentioned line along the Euphrates Valley. It may also be known to the Imperial Government that the 4 per cent, surtax on the Turkish customs duties received the assent of His Majesty’s Government on certain conditions, among which was one to the effect that no kilometric guarantees should be defrayed out of the proceeds of the surtax, and that an assurance in writing to this effect should be obtained from the German Government by the Sublime Porte. It is, however, unlikely that this assurance will be given; for the Bagdad Railway Company are aware that unless the additional surtax on imports is assented to by the Powers and unless some, at least, of the proceeds therefrom are applied to pay kilometric guarantees, these guarantees cannot be defrayed. A few days since M. Gwinner informed Sir H. Babington Smith that he is now ready to consent to the following conditions :— 1. Control over the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section of the railway is to be British ; 2. The construction of this section is to be carried out with British material and by British agency; 3. Non-British interests are to participate in this section only in a subordinate capacity ; and 4. The railway north of Bagdad is to be in no way connected with the British group. Sir E. Grey had informed Count Metternich that unless an agreement was reached respecting the Bagdad Railway, His Majesty’s Government would be unable to consent to the Turkish customs duties being increased ; and he had also observed that the necessity of inviting the co-operation of Russia as well as France constituted one of the difficulties in the way of His Majesty’s Government participating in the railway. HeA decision m the matter is urgently needed, as the question of increasing the lurkish customs duties is involved. Opposition to such an increase cannot be maintained by His Majesty’s Government alone; and once this point is conceded there will be no obstacle to the completion of the Bagdad Railway by Germany.

Germany hopes to obtain the necessary funds by an increase of the Turkish customs duties, and all the Powers, with the exception of England, were apparently ready to concede this increase without any stipulation about the Bagdad Railway. My Government were obliged to consider what stipulation they should make to protect themselves in giving their consent to the increase of customs duties. Russia can of course equally do the same, and my Government are waiting for your views before going further. Nothing more has been said to the German Ambassador than what I communicated in my pro-memorid of the 6th (19th) November. As I informed you in a private letter two or . three days ago, as soon as the proposals of M. Gwinner reached my Government they were immediately communicated to you.

Cassel’s visit to Berlin and Herr Gwhmer. S1 ° nS COnCermng the Ba « dad Railwa y b «tween that gentleman and He said that he would speak to me quite frankly and loyally upon this subiect It was quite possible that Sir E. Cassel and Herr Gwinner might come to a satisfactorv agreement, as fer as the commercial interests involved in the question were concerned but as he would have me to understand, it did not follow that the Imperial Government would see their way to confirming such an agreement, at all events at once. He did not wish me to think that the Government had any objection to British participation because that was by no means the case. But public opinion in Germany would be up m arms and make things very unpleasant for the Imperial Government unless the latter could show that there was some return for what they would certainly regard as a. concession. The so-called Lynch monopoly would add fuel to the flame, and there would certainly be a universal cry that German interests were being sacrificed with nothing to show on the credit side of the account. Herr von Schoen then again repeated that the Imperial Government had no wish to raise any objection to British participation in the Bagdad Railway, and gave me to understand that, as, owing to events in England, there was no hurry about the matter, there would be plenty of time to discover some means by which German public opinion could be satisfied that the advantage was not wholly on the side of England. Perhaps even such means might be found on the resumption of the discussion with regard to the future relations between Great Britain and Germany. I told Herr von Schoen that he need not regard events in England as any obstacle to coming to an under- standing about the Bagdad Railway, for, as I had already had the honour to inform him, Sir E. Grey was perfectly ready to discuss the matter with the Imperial Government as soon as the parties directly interested in the matter as a commercial understanding had exchanged their views on the subject; I had understood that this was the point of view of the Imperial Government also. In any case, until the two Governments were aware of the result of the discussions he had alluded to between rlen Gwinner and Sir Ernest Cassel, it was obviously impossible for me to ao-ree or disagree with hirn as to the effect any agreement they might come to might have on German public opinion. I could only express the personal view that, as the discussions with regard to British participation had apparently been initiated by Herr Gwinner and were m his capable hands, it seemed fairly certain that the interests he lepresented were not likely to suffer much in any arrangement that he might suggest or. accept, at all events not in a degree which was likely to shock German public opinion. . • r From the remark which Herr von Schoen casually dropped with regard to what might happen when the discussions concerning Anglo-German future relations were iesumed, it may, I think, be fairly surmised that it is m the mind of the Imperial Government that the construction and control of the Bagdad—Persian Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway may be utilised as a lever to push His Majesty’s Government farther in the direction of a political understanding than they have yet shown any disposition to go. This alleged inability or reluctance on the part of the Imperial Government to face the Reichstag or public opinion unless they can show that they have got the best of a bargain has become chronic, and it has to be taken into serious account in ail negotiations with which they are concerned. I have had some talk with Sir E. Gassel upon the kueject of his conversations with Hen Gwinner, and he read to me a memorandum recording the latter’s proposals. As you will have seen him before you get this, it is not necessary for me to say anything about it, all the more that he read it too quickly for me to seize all the [2536 x —3]details. But of course I could not help remarking that kilometnc guarantees play a certain role in Gwinner’s proposals. I reminded Sir Ernest Cassel that His Majesty s Government particularly wished to avoid kilometric guarantees, but he said that that must be a matter for the Governments to discuss a,fterwards. The chiet thing wasp, to o-et the control and construction. He hated the principles of kilometric guarantees, but he would sooner have the concession with them than no concession at all.

Commercial consider ations- though they were not unimportant, ami though they have become more important with the prospect of the agricultural devel- opme n t of Mes opot am i a- w e re, and remain, secondary. Mr. v. Cwinner's proposals do not appear to secure to this country that measure of control which is essential to the Kl attainmentattainment of the main object of Govt.in undertaking these negotiations. If his account of the origin of the^n proposals is correct / it would seem possible that pressure on tne Turkish Govt» may effect a withdrawal of this objectionable limitation, and Lord Morley cannot advise the acceptance of a scheme unde r wh i ch Br itish inte rest s a re not so preponderant in the Gulf section as German interests are in the western sections. It is difficult to criti cise the financial details of the scheme in the absence of all information as to the real state of the Company s profit and loss account 0 Moreover, the memorandum is very \ obscure. The clue to the proposals is perhaps to be found in the exchange of views between the Turkish Minister of Finance and M. K emit 7 . summarised in Mr. Marlings ; •- despatch No. 933 of 24th Nov. It would then appear that the Germans are seeking a qu id pro quo for renouncing their claim to the addit ional customs duties at the expense of Bagdad-Gulf section of the line, which is to contribute such a Mump sum to the parent Co. asas will nominally constitute a Uj (victL reserve fund, but really ajusxSite, ^S\ fc*. /Cu/ilv*4 (ftYYYmJLdA c/Z hu^O\ Jh fc, ' C$7iJVyr\ - vxms&amp;i&amp;Mvik&amp;ifii q^T *&gt;t xufcl smjjj&amp;s CXl'l ZfcljJYrtjAH* '/(XmAAaA led* '*Y\,. ikw \$*&amp;Jdi)4*m• This point seems to require careful examination before H .ft.Govt • arrive at a final decision as to tr&amp; additional duties / and the with drawal of the requirement that the Bag dad-Gulf section should contribute €82000 per kilometre to the parent Oo. might perhaps be made a condition of the abandon ment by I J JJ.

So far as the Bagdad Company was concerned, they would have no objection to the English interests having a controlling proportion. &amp; . ^ I on Dwinner stated that the origin of this idea was Hussein Hilmi’s remark asking him to come_to an understanding with the English. Owing to the refusal on the part of the British Government to sanction the 4 per cent, additional customs unless an undertaking were given that the proceeds should not be pledged to the Bagdad Railway, there might now be a moderate deficiency in the provision of the security for the 3rd series of Bagdad bonds which are to be issued for the purpose of completing the line up to Helif. _ This security is based upon the excess at the public debt to which the Government is entitled, and which would be increased immediately if an augmenta tion of tbe Customs tariff were agreed to. It is not expected that this issue will have to be made for several years yet, when the other income will cover all requirements, but both the Turkish Government and the Bagdad Company recognise that it would be an advantage to all parties if a definite arrangement relating thereto could be come to without much delay, and the Germans distinctly object to a change of the existing contract and bonds. Accordingly, the Grand Vizier, in the presence of the Minister of Finance, suggested to M. von Gwinner to see whether arrangements could not be made by the Bagdad Company with English interests. The discussion of the terms was confined to the respective participations. M. von Gwinner explained that he had verbally informed the Turkish Government that the Bagdad Company would not insist upon the application of the 4 per cent, additional customs beyond the Bagdad loans series 2 and 3. Their contract entitled them to this ; but as they were anxious to meet the wishes of the Turkish Government [2536 u —2]and desirous not unduly to burden Turkish finance, it would in such case be left to the Government to fix themselves a future date on which they would provide the security for the construction from Helif to the Persian Gulf. M. von Gwinner states that no arrangement for handing over the Bagdad end o, the line to the control of other interests would be satisfactory to the Bagdad Company, nor to the Turkish Government, unless it ensured the whole construction from Helif to the Gulf: this for the reason that, whereas a line terminating somewhere in Upper Mesopotamia would be a burden on the lurkish Ireasury, a through line would soon pay itself, and immediately increase the revenue of Turkey by a larger amount than the subvention loans would require. M. von Gwinner sees no other way now of carrying this out except by assigning part of the additional customs dues to the guaranty of the Bagdad subvention loans from Helif to the Persian Gulf. These loans would require about 500,000/. per annum, the distance being some 1,100 kilom., whereof about 560 kilom. are between Bagdad and Bussorah (outside of about 106 kilom. from Zobeir Junction to Kazima, on the Gulf of Koweit; this section may be built later). It appears from the Bagdad concession that the Turkish Government is to pay about 269,000 fr., in 4 per cent, bonds, per kilometre, being, at 80 per cent., about 8,500/. cash per kilometre. Now, M. von Gwinner explained this amount is an average (there are kilometres that cost six times the average); and, further, the Bagdad Railway requires to set aside a sum not inferior to 2,000/. on the 1,100 kilom. unfinished towards a reserve required for the working of the entire line, towards gradually increasing the rolling stock, and generally to fulfil the burdensome clauses of the concession. Accordingly, his proposal is that, of the subvention loan for the section from Bagdad to Bussorah, a sum of 2,000/. per kilometre should be left to the Bagdad Railway Company, the remaining 6,500/. per kilometre being amply sufficient to construct the line from Bagdad to the Gulf, to provide its rolling stock, and leave a sufficient reserve in the new company’s treasury for fulfilling on this section the working of the line and conditions of the general concession. This concession for the line between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf would have to be transferred with the consent of the Turkish Government to the new company to be formed. The share which the old Bagdad Railw’ay Company claims as its consideration, viz., the 30 per cent, interest in the new railway and construction companies, would remain in the old company's treasury.

Hardinge, to whom he handed a memorandum, copy of which is enclosed, on the subject of the proposed increase of the Turkish customs duties. His Excellency was informed that if the Turkish Government had conceded at once what His Majesty s Government had asked, the conditions put forward need not have been regarded as such. For instance, Hilmi Pasha had objected to the with drawal of the irade by which a veto was placed on loans raised by Egypt, on the ground that it would be opposed by the Turkish Parliament. To meet this difficulty we had suggested that the Turkish Government should address a note to the Egyptian Government, stating that whenever permission was required by the Egyptian Govern ment to raise a loan for industrial enterprises or works of public utility, or for purposes of conversion, it would be given at once without delay ; but Hilmi Pasha had objected to this, and considered his proposal adequate, which was not the view of His Majesty’s Government. As for the kilometric guarantees, we had asked for an undertaking in writing from the German Government or the German company that the proceeds of the 4 per cent, would not be demanded for the Bagdad Railway, but we had not yet received it, and without it the position could not be secure. Tewfik Pasha took note of what Sir C. Hardinge had said to him as to Egyptian loans, and, as regards the kilometric guarantees, said that there would be no difficulty in obtaining an engagement from the German Government in the sense desired by His Majesty’s Government, since it had been officially promised.

W11H reference to Sir Conyngham Greene’s despatch No. 56, Confidential, of the 21st November, 1903, on the subject of the Bagdad Railway, I have the honour to report that, as announced by the “ Times ” correspondent in Berlin, a new company has been constituted at Glams in Switzerland, termed the “ Societe pour la Con struction de Chemins de Fer en Turquie,” with a capital of 10,000,000 fr. (400,000Z.), for the purpose of further railway construction in Asiatic Turkey. The immediate object is to extend the Bagdad Railway for a distance of 840kilom. from Bulgurlu. The real reason for constituting the new company in Switzerland appears to be that the enterprise thus commenced will be judged to have an international character, and the founders hope by this means to attract more capital from France, Switzerland’ and even Italy, than would be the case were the company to have been formed in Berlin.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received December 20.) Constantinople, December 13, 1909. mb, brerman Ambassador, on whom I had occasion to call last Saturday, asked whether 1 knew that Mr. Whittall had been to London and Berlin in connection with the Bagdad Railway, and, if so, if I had heard what had connection with passed. I said that Mi. Whittall had undertaken his journey on the suggestion of Dr. Grwinner, who had also invited Sir H. Babington Smith to discuss with him the question of British participation m that undertaking, that X did not know what had passed, but that X understood that Mr. Whittall had been commissioned by Sir E. Cassel to arrange for a meeting with Dr Gwinner, a meeting which was to take place in one or two days, but that he had not been authorised to make any definite statement on behalf of Sir Ernest. The meeting was to have taken place in Paris, but owing to injuries received in a motor-car accident Dr. Gwinner has been unable to travel. Sir XI. Babington Smith, I added, had just left Constantinople to take part in the conference. His Excellency said that he hoped that some result would be reached; he had never been able to understand on what grounds the “Times” had led the campaign against British co-operation, which had resulted in the breakdown of the negotiations in X903, which he knew to have had the support of the Foreign Office; he understood that one principal requirement now was the control of the Bagdad end of the line; as for Sir W. Willcocks’s scheme of a Bagdad-Homs-Damascus Railway, that was financially impossible, as the line was to pass over 400 kilom. of desert, where it could earn nothing ; besides which, Sir William’s estimate of its cost—2,500,000L—was much too low. X said that I did not know what His Majesty’s Government’s views were, but I thought it probable that they would communicate them to Sir E. Cassel, but otherwise leave him a free hand to deal with the financial aspects of the matter. Baron von Marschall again repeated his earnest wish that some arrangement satisfactory to the Powers could be reached, so as to put an end to the friction between them here. I should perhaps remark that since the re-establishment of the constitution the German Embassy has made several efforts to regain its prominence in the councils of those who really control the Government, and as those efforts have so far been ineffectual, their Government has reason to wish to come to terms with us, and thus take the line of least resistance and secure the co-operation instead of the rivalry of British prestige and influence in this country. Xt may also have occurred to Baron von Marschall that, should the Germans fail to come to terms with us in the matter of the remaining sections of the Bagdad Railway, and should Great Britain throw the whole of her weight into the Bagdad-Mediterranean line advocated by Sir W. Willcocks, coupled with the navigation of the two rivers, the prospects of the German line ever being completed on its present conditions and trace becomes very problematical. The Ottoman Parliament found it impossible to upset the convention for the sections of that railway up to Halif, but, as may be gleaned from the tone of the discussion over the Mesopotamian navigation project, it would almost certainly withhold its consent to any convention for the further sections on the old conditions.

Isvolsky s policy in connection with this line had always been a negative one, and at present he was at^ a loss what to do. He was anxious to prevent the north of Asia Minoi from becoming a German sphere of influence, and he wanted to have something to show the Russian public as a gain on his part in the event of His Majesty s Government coming to an agreement with the German Government with regard to the section of the line from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf. Sir C. Hardinge pointed out to Count Benckendorff that the obvious policy of the Russian Government was to acquire the right of construction and control of the Khamkm blanch of the Bagdad Railway, and that if M. Isvolsky obtained a concession for the construction of a line in the north of Asia Minor by way of Sivas and Diarbekir, regarding which discussions were already in progress, he should have no difficulty in satisfying the Russian public. Sir C. Hardinge added that I was in favour of earmarking those railways which the two Governments might desire to construct in Persia, but that I was not yet in possession of the views of the India Office.

Mr. Mnrliny to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received December 13 ) (No. 946. Secret.) Si 1 *, Constantinople, December 5, 1909. IN their report of the 24th July last the Mesopotamian Railway Committee state that they “ understand that His Majesty’s Government would be willing to guarantee a reasonable rate of interest on the capital invested by any British syndicate which might be formed ” for the purpose of acquiring a concession for a railway in those regions, and, so far as I am aware, financial support in some such form is still under the serious consideration of His Majesty’s Government. I would, however, venture to point out that the fact, if it became public, that His Majesty’s Government intend to take a direct financial interest in any railway scheme in Mesopotamia, would make the acquisition of a concession for that purpose very problematic. As you are aware, the designs of England for territorial aggrandisement in the regions about the Turkish Gulf was, under the old regime, a favourite card to play with those who desired to thwart any British interests there, and this notion has been sedulously fostered of late, so that a widespread, if vague, distrust of our policy now exists in certain circles. How easily it can be aroused is shown by the excitement which ensued on the publication of the alleged text of your recent communication to Tewfik Pasha on the Lynch affair, and I make no manner of doubt that the Turkish Parliament, with its unreasonably susceptible patriotism, would look on the fact that His Majesty’s Government were granting a guarantee to a British railway syndicate as so positive a proof to our alleged designs that it would never sanction a concession, even if a Ministry could be found strong enough to decide in favour of granting it. I would therefore venture to urge that, if possible, the utmost secrecy should be used in regard to the proposed guarantee, or that it should be granted in some form that need not necessarily become public. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. [2536 n—1]Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 6.) (No- 628.) St. Petersburgh, November 28, 1909. I WOULD beg leave to summarise certain conversations which I have had with M. Isvolsky in regard to the Bagdad Railway. M. Isvolsky is now perfectly well aware that matters have not hitherto proceeded further than the reception by the British group of certain proposals made by M. Gwinner to the effect that the former should have the construction and control of the section south of Bagdad, and that if this proposal were accepted the British interests in the railway north of Bagdad would be waived. He further understands that His Majesty’s Government lost no time in informing him of these proposals, and that hitherto they have not entered into any negotiations with the German Government on the subject. It has also been brought to his knowledge that the objections of His Majesty’s Government to their consent to the increase of Turkish customs duties cannot be indefinitely maintained, and that the control and construction of the southern section of the railway are the minimum which would satisfy British public opinion and British interests; that, if necessary, Germany would of herself construct the whole railway without outside co-operation; and that His Majesty’s Government are anxiously awaiting information as to the views of the Russian Government in regard to participation in the railway. The above are the chief points which have been brought to the knowledge of M. Isvolsky. His present attitude may be summarised as follows: He considers that the proposals of M. Gwinner constitutes an entirely new departure; he does not question the right of the British group or of His Majesty’s Government to accept them, and he expects that eventually they will do so; he fully appreciates the loyalty of His Majesty’s Government in so promptly informing him of the proposals, and of abstaining from accepting immediately proposals which are so eminently satisfactory to British interests. He regards an arrangement between Eugland and Germany on the basis of the proposals ot M. Gwinner as dispelling any expectation that the Bagdad Railway will be discussed between Germany, England, France, and Russia. It will necessarily amount to an arrangement between Germany and England, by which the latter will secure for herself the southern section, and in return abandon all interest in the line to the north of Bagdad. In these circumstances he considers that Russia will be left alone to discuss matters with Germany so far as Russian interests are concerned. These interests he regards, from the political, strategical, and economical points of view, as of great importance ; and he is of opinion that Russia will enter into negotiations with Germany with her hands much weakened. Had he been able to have the continuation of British co-operation in these negotiations he would be more hopeful of their success. France, he considers is already in a sense a partner in the Bagdad Railway, and, moreover, her interests in the project are small in comparison with those of Russia. He has at present, so far as I have been able to ascertain, no definite views as to the basis on which he would endeavour to obtain a Russian participation in the railway. I do not think that he so much desires an actual participation in the railway; he rather wishes to assure h im self that Germany will not endeavour to push railway enterprise in those portions of Persia in which Russia possesses direct and immediate interests. In what manner he may secure such assurances he is not at present very clear, but he is well aware that in order to do so he will probably be obliged to offer Germany a quid pro quo. Of what character such a quid pro quo will be he does not know, nor is he decided as to the quarter in which he could find it. I do not think that he would consider himself precluded from seeking it in the neutral zone of Persia, but he will keep His Majesty s Government informed of the progress of his negotiations with Germany whenever they may be commenced. Personally, I doubt if M. Isvolsky would be inclined to admit Germany into the neutral zone of Persia; but I hardly think in case of such an endeavour we could appeal to the Anglo-Russian convention, though we might have other grounds for raising objections. By article 2 of the convention each party agreed not to support concessions to third parties in the zones of the other,^ but as regards the neutral zone there was, I submit, no restriction on third parties seeking concessions and [2536/-l]no obligation on either party to abstain from supporting third parties in that rer~ It was simply piovided in article 3 that Russia would not oppose British concey as nor England Russian concessions in that zone. So far as I can recollect it was under stood that there should be no mention of the liberty of action of third parties in the neutral zone so as to obviate opening the door to observations on their part, and to keep the convention strictly within the limits of an understanding regarding British and Russian interests. It was for this reason that m my written paraphrase of your telegram No 1343 of the 26th November I omitted any reference to article 3, though, in conversation, I alluded to the point without dwelling upon it, as I did not feel sure ° f in Af regards the question of a line from Bagdad to Khanikin, M. Isvolsky remarked that the Germans had already a concession for a line from a point to the north of Bagdad to Khanikin, and he seemed to think that this would render superfluous a second branch from Bagdad to that place. With respect to the increase of Turkish customs duties, M-. Isvolsky stated very positively that the Russian Government had as yet given no reply to the Turkish request, and he read the last paragraph of the Turkish note as debarring the Ottoman Government from devoting any portion of the proceeds of the surtax to kilometric guarantees of any enterprise already commenced, and within that category he placed the Bagdad Railway. He would like to have the views of His Majesty’s Government on that point. As matters at present stand, I should say that M. Isvolsky fully anticipates that His Majesty’s Government will negotiate with the German Government, or allow the two groups to do so, on the basis of the proposals ol M. Gwinner, and that therefore Russia will be left to come to the best terms she can with Germany. As to what offers he may be disposed to make m order to tranquillise his mind as to possible eventual German enterprise to the east of the Bagdad Railway I cannot say. My own impression is that if he feels he has a perfectly free hand, he may be disposed to ofter a good deal; and on that point I confess I am not entirely at ease. I have, &amp;c. A.

Pichon, in a private letter, a further memorandum, of _ which a copy is transmitted herewith, informing him of the communication which you had instructed Sir Arthur Nicolson to make to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs. SIB FRANCIS BERTIE informed his Excellency M. Pichon on the 19th instant of a communication addressed by Sir Edward Grey to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh in regard to the Bagdad Railway, in which it was stated that His Majesty’s Government had been given to understand that the German Government might be disposed to waive, in favour of His Majesty’s Government, all their rights to construct a railway south of Bagdad, leaving it to them to come to an arrangement with the Turkish Government in regard to the construction of a line from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf, on tbe understanding that the British group should have nothing to do with the line north of Bagdad. It was imperative for British interests in Mesopotamia to obtain the concession for such a line, and, should it be granted, His Majesty’s Government would consider the possibility of agreeing unconditionally to the proposed increase in the Turkish customs duties, to which all the other Powers seemed disposed to give their consent. Sir Arthur Nicolson informed M. Isvolsky of this communication on the 19th November. In reply to an observation made by his Excellency that Germany was apparently to be given a free hand in the construction of the line north of Bagdad, Sir Arthur Nicolson has been instructed to point out that the existing concession has already conferred rights of this nature on Germany. The latter only required the money for construction, and this she hoped to obtain through the increase of the Turkish customs duties. With the exception of Great Britain all the Powers appeared to be willing to consent to the proposed increase without any reservation in regard to the Bagdad Railway. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government were obliged to consider what stipulations should be made for the protection of British interests in consenting to the increase of the customs duties. Russia was free to take similar steps, and His Majesty’s Government desired to .ascertain the views of M. Isvolsky before proceeding I have, &amp;c. FRANCIS BERTIE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum communicated to French Ministry for Foreign Affairs. [2518 gg-l-]further in the matter. Sir Edward Grey had hitherto not said anything to the German Government, except that he felt compelled to make his consent to the increase of the customs duties dependent on an agreement in regard to the Bagdad Railway, and that one of the difficulties in the way of the participation of Great Britain in the schema lay in the necessity for an agreement with Russia and France on the subject. He ha said, however, that he would endeavour to discover a solution, and he had at once communicated with M. Isvolsky. Sir Arthur Nicolson was further instructed to remind M. Isvolsky that the belief as to the terms to which Germany might be disposed to agree was not derived from negotiations with the German Government, as no such negotiations had taken place, hut was based on information obtained through unofficial channels. Sir Edward Grey considered that it was essential that the Russian Government should arrive at a decision as to the conditions on which they would be prepared to participate in the construction of the line north of Bagdad Such conditions had not yet been communicated to His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Government had always demanded that the control and construction of the railway south of Bagdad should be in their hands, and they could not be satisfied with less than this. The matter had become one of the greatest importance to British interests. The Turkish Government were commencing irrigation works south of Bagdad, and it was probable that as a result of these works the rivers would become un-navigable from want of water. The transpoit by river of the trade with India, which had been in British hands for over fifty years, would consequently be rendered impracticable and, until the railway was built, no other means of transport would be available. It seemed, moreover, a matter of absolute certainty that the railway would be built at some future time whether England and Russia participated in its construction or not. His Majesty’s Government must, for the above-mentioned reasons, give close consideration to the present situation and the offer which they had received. They desired, however, to learn the views of the Russian Government before taking any further action in the matter. Paris, November 24, 1909. In closure 2 in No. 1. Fuither Memorandum communicated to French Ministry for Foreign Affairs. HIS Majesty s Government have as yet returned no reply to the German proposal put forward by Mr. Gwinner, the substance of which has been communicated to the rench and Russian Governments. This proposal represents the minimum which could be accepted as a satisfaction to public opinion in Great Britain and as a safeguard to British interests. His Majesty’s Government would be willing to waive their interests m le me to t e north of Bagdad if, by so doing, they could arrive at an agreement in regard to the .southern portion, although the British group interested in the railway have urged them to endeavour to obtain a concession for the construction of a branch line to connect Bagdad with Khanikin. His Majesty’s Government realise, however, that such a line, terminating as it would at a locality on the limit of the Russian sphere ot interests m Persia, might affect Russian interests, and, though they would be glad to secure a concession for such a line or to participate with Russia in its construction and control they have so far not given any support to such a proposal, and they will retrain from doing so unless they are assured of the concurrence of the Russian Government. I? -i ihe ^ erman Government are cognisant of the proposals made by the Bagdad Railway Company, but His Majesty’s Government are disposed to leave it to the English group interested to conduct the negotiations in regard thereto on a purely commercial basis. r j His Majesty’s Government have been informed of the views of the Russian overnmen in regard to their participation in the railway, but the matter is somewhat urgent, as a decision m regard to the question of the increase of the Turkish customs u ies . cai }T at . e delayed indefinitely.

I am not aware of the substance ot the communications you have received from Sir Adam Block, nor so far as 1 can ascertain, has he recently expressed any such view to the embassy. ’ Sir A. .ill’ mi° cal l ed on me . tllls mining, cannot recall the communication to which you allude, ihe only expression of that gentleman’s views that I can find in the embassv is contained m some notes appended to a memorandum of a conversation he had with • • Huguemn, the director of the Anatoliail Railway Companv, on the 4th August last m which he says : I consider that normally the Public Debt revenues will shortly increase, and will eventually suffice for sections 4 and 5.” Sir A Block sent a copy of this memorandum to Sir C. Hardinge about the same time that he communicated it to Sir G. Lowther. To return to the question of how the company now intend to find the security of he fourth and fifth sections of the railway, Sir A. Block informs me that there are three sources of revenue handled by the Debt which might be drawn on, viz.: (I) Surplus of the tithes collected by the Debt for railway guarantees, amounting to something between £ T 60,000 and £ T. 100,000 per annum; (2) the interest on the reserve fund of the Debt when that fund reaches £ T. 2,000,000-this may very well occur within twelve months and the interest available may be put at £ T. 80,000: and (3) the advanpe of £ T. 250,000 which the Debt undertook to make to the Government ° r ,J, e nee( J s Macedonia. It is clear that, with the anticipated increase of the Debt s surplus, the Sublime Porte will eventually dispose of more than sufficient revenues to find the £ T. 244,000 required for the third series. From Sir A. Block I have also learnt that there has been an exchange of views between the Minister of Finance and M. Kautz, the director of the Bagdad Railway as to the revenues, other than the 4 per cent., which could be assigned to the service of series 2 (sections 2 and 3), and with the following result: Djavid Bey proposed the surplus revenues of the Debt, about £ T. 200,000, the sheep tax of the vilayets of Adana and Aleppo, set free for forty years by the recent transaction concerning the Russian loan indemnity, and estimated at £ T. 40,000, and, lastly, the surplus of the tithes collected by the Debt, which may be placed at between £ T. 60,000 and c ^. * 100,000 per annum. M^. Kautz admitted the adequacy of these revenues, but stipulated that they should be paid to the railway by the Debt. The Minister of linance demurred, however, and said that the moneys would be paid into the Govern ment by the Debt, and the Minister of Finance would make the requisite payments to the railway company. To this M. Kautz objected, and said that if the Government j insisted he must ask for a quid pro quo, viz., an undertaking by the Government to conclude the financial arrangements for the prolongation of the line from Halif to Mosul. He said he would telegraph to Berlin to ask for authoritv to treat on these lines. This move on the part of the Germans is a clever one, and it implies that they do not intend to renounce their claim on the 4 per cent, without obtaining a valuable concession in exchange. They can, moreover, argue to the Turkish Government that to see the line carried to Mosul is in the interests of the Treasury, for the Aleppo- E1 Halif section ending as it would en Vair would not pay, and the kilometric [2518/-l] i &gt; /. II Itguarantee will be a drain on the Governm^t, whereas if the line is prolonged to Mosul the through traffic thence would greatly increase the rece lp ts and dimmish the amount required as kilometric guarantee according y. amount eq ^ whom Mr . Fitzmaunce had some conversation yesterday afternoon^ speaks'with great confidence of the strength of the German position. He says that by making it a condition that the 4 per cent, should not be utilised for railway guarantees His Maiesty’s Government had declared war on the Bagdad Railway which it was in the Turkish interest to have built, but that if the Germans did not obtain satisfactory financial arrangements to carry out their engagements wi h the Turks they themselves would withhold their assent to the increase of the customs duties, and the Turks would logically conclude that their refusal was owing to the attitude of Great Britain in the railway question. This attitude of M. Kautz is no doubt a bargaining one and he gave it to be understood that he would prefer some business-like entente with the British as regards the completion of the line. ^nHART/FlS M.

It was therefore essential that we should get a concession for a railway from Bagdad to the Persian uuili to take the place of this river communication. [2518 a—1] I am, &amp;c. E.

Bertie to Sir Edivard Grey.—{Received November 22.) (No. 455. Secret.) Paris, November 20, 1909. I RECEIVED on the night of the 18th instant the telegram which you had dispatched that day to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!! relative to the application to the Porte by His Majesty’s Government for the concession for a railway from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf bv the Valley of the Tigris, with the option of prolonging it along the Euphrates Valley from Bagdad to the Mediterranean ; the condition attached to the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the 4 per cent, increase in the Turkish customs duties as regards kilometric guarantees to railways; the apparent readiness of Mr. Gwinner to agree that the section of the Bagdad railway from Bagdad to the Gulf should be under British control, and should be constructed by British agency and with British material; the communication which yon made on the subject of the Bagdad Railway and the increase of customs duties to the German Ambassador ; the conditions subject to which His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to forego any participation in the Bagdad Railway north of Bagdad and give their consent to the increase in the customs duties. In view of the fact that you authorised Sir Arthur Nicolson to give to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs the information contained in your telegram, and that if you had not already made a like communication to the French Ambassador in London the information would reach the French Government from St. Petersburgh, I thought that it would be advisable to inform M. Pichon of the communication which you had directed His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh to make to M. Isvolsky. When therefore I called on his Excellency yesterday evening, 1 reminded him of the observations which he had made to me on the 7th ultimo (see my despatch No. 402 of the 8th October) on the question of connecting the consent of His Majesty’s Government to an increase in the customs duties with a stipulation that an assurance should be given by the German Government in legard to the Bagdad Railway, and 1 asked him whether he had made or received any further communication on the subject. His Excellency said that he had drafted a formula which, whilst having the effect of precluding any part of the proceeds of the additional customs duties being employed for the purpose of the Bagdad Railway, would, he thought, safeguard the interests of all the Powers in other matters. As he told me that he had not quite recently received any communication from the French Ambassador in London on the subject of the Bagdad Railway, I read to his Excellency your telegram of the 18th instant to Sir Arthur Nicolson, and he expressed satisfaction at there being a prospect of a settlement of the question. He further said that he did not think that the Ottoman Bank and their German partners in the combination for raising money for the railway would be able to obtain all the requisite funds without recourse to the Paris market, and the French Government did not intend to allow a quotation of the loan on the Bourse except on conditions which hitherto the German company had not been willing to accept.

CASSEL called last nigbt and talked of the Bagdad and Hit railways. He regards tlie^ Bagdad-Gulf Railway as the most important of the two, and believes that foi grain transport the Persian Gnlf route will always be cheaper than the route across the desert via Hit. He said that it is also absolutely necessary that we should obtain the Khanikin branch which must start from Bagdad and not from Sadije. I remarked that the Germans would not be likely to give this up. He replied that he thought they would give it up, and that we must have it on account of the Persian trade coming from the Gulf. As regards the Hit Railway, it would no doubt compete with the Bagdad Railway, and might in the end be a paying concern. Sir W. Willcocks had told him that you had suggested the possibility of the Government taking shares in the railway, and that Sir W. Willcocks had talked a good deal of a Government guarantee, but that he was opposed to both-ideas, and wished that the two railways should be constructed and run on purely commercial lines. He thought that the French would not co-operate in the Hit line, as they have 30 per cent, interest in the Bagdad Railway. The line would have to be a metre gauge, as nothing less would do for heavy transport. He thought that Sir W. Willcocks had greatly underestimated the cost of construction. He intends, therefore, to send an engineer to report. He wishes to know as soon as possible the views of His Majesty’s Government, and will himself, as head of the National Bank, negotiate with Dr. Gwinner, whom he knows very well. He remarked that there must be a conflict between the Germans and the Turks, since the Germans want the 4 per cent, kilometric guarantees, while the Turks want it for a large loan as guarantee. That, I remarked, is no concern of ours, if we can get all we want. C. H. Foreign Office, November 19, 1909. • I never suggested that the Government should take shares in the Hit Railway ; it was Sir W. Willcocks who made some suggestion of the kind to me, when I pointed out the difficulties of a Government guarantee. I made no comment on the suggestion, which does not differ much from a Government guarantee. If Parliament would agree to one it would probably agree to the other. The Khanikin branch may complicate matters with the Russians.

ISYOLSKY told me yesterday that ho had some secret information to give me. He had learnt that Mr. Winston Churchill, when recently in Germany, had informed Mahmet Chefket Pasha that an English company would shortly apply to the Ottoman Government for the concession of a railway from Koweit to Bagdad without requiring any guarantees, and that similar information had been communicated to Tewfik Pasha in London. I observed to M. Isvolsky that this was in all probability the scheme as to which I had given him private information some little time ago, and to which he had made no objection. His Excellency said that he quite understood that, but he wished to communicate to me the subsequent developments, which he thought might be of interest. Hilmi Pasha had naturally received intelligence of the project, and had not viewed it favourably, though he admitted that it would probably be pleasing to the Turkish Parliament, in view of the fact that no guarantees were required. He had, in order to block an exclusively British project, suggested to the German Ambassador whether the German railway company would not be disposed to form a combination for the last section of the railway with French and English concessionnaires. Baron Marschall said that he had no objection to such a combination, provided that no further difficulties were raised in regard to the Bulgurlou-Hilif section. He would be prepared in such circumstances to recommend the combination which Hilmi Pasha suggested. I told M. Isvolsky that I had heard nothing whatever as to the proposed com bination, but he could be assured that my Government would not enter into any discussions as to the Bagdad Railway unless Russia was a party to them. He knew well that my Government had consistently declined a conversation a deux, and had maintained that it should be d quatre ; and I felt confident that they would not move from that position. His Excellency said that he had no doubts on that head, but he had chiefly desired to draw my attention to the attitude of Hilmi Pasha. I have, &amp;c. A.

As to tbe line from Bagdad to Khanikin, be remarked that German company had already a concession for a line to Khanikm from a point to the north of Bagdad Be said that if we were to enter into negotiations with Germany on the basis of proposals of Herr Gwmner _ Russia would of course have to commence dis cussions on behalf of her own interests with Germany, but that she would enter into them with her hands much weakened if Germany had already come to an arrange- ment wxth us. He would have of course to be in a position to have somethin^ m and wheiewith to bargain with Germany. I said that bargain should not in any case be m the neutral zone of Persia, as this would hardly be in accordance with our convention. (Personally I have my doubts on the point.) He replied that he did not say that he would look for a bargain in that direction, but that he must be prepared to o er something. He would, in the event of our falling in with new proposals, find Germany very [? stiff] m negotiating with him. I asked him, after some further conversation^ what reply I should send you, but I regret to say I could extract nothing from him beyond that he must examine question very carefully and would let me have a reply later. I explained to him that if we all sat still and did nothing Germany would perhaps withdraw all offers and construct line herself without co-operation of either of us. He said that he had not had an answer to the question which he put to me at our last interview. I asked him to what he alluded. He said were we or were we not going to accept Herr Gwinner’s proposals and abandon our interests to the north of Bagdad, i.e., give up the conversation d quatre and enter into one d deux °? I replied that we had decided nothing as yet, and were awaiting his views, but that it was probable we should have to do so if further delay occurred. He asked whether we thought that his interpretation of the paragraph in the Turkish note as to the surtax was correct, namely, that Turkey promised not to devote proceeds to any enterprises already commenced, and that thereby she could not give them to Bagdad Railway. I said I had not had a reply on that point. _ I cannot pin M. Isvolsky down, and perhaps you would wish me to tell him positively that you would inform British group that they had better proceed without delay with negotiations with Herr Gwinner. I am a little uneasy still, as I mentioned in my private letter, as to leaving him to discuss alone with Germany, but perhaps we had better run that risk and secure southern section. / [ 881 — 169 ]CONFIDENTIAL.

J he proposal made to us is the minimum of what would satisfy British public opinion and safeguard British interests, and to obtain this we should be willing to waive our interests m the railway to the north of Bagdad, although some pressure has been put upon us by the British group to endeavour to obtain the concession of a blanch from Bagdad to Khamkm. \\ o realise, however, that Russian interests might be involved m a line terminating at a point on the limit of the Russian sphere of interest 111 ei sia, and although we should be glad to obtain a concession for such a line or to participate with Russia in its control and construction, we have refrained from giviim- an) support to such a proposal, and shall not do so without the concurrence of the Russian Government. Although the German Government are aware that proposals have been made to us by the Bagdad Railway Company, we propose to allow the negotiations to be carried on by the English group on a purely commercial basis. I he matter is one of some urgency, as a decision about the increase of Turkish customs dues cannot be mdelimtely postponed, and we are as yet in complete ignorance oi the views ol the Russian Government as to participation. Two years ago Russian negotiations with Germany fell through owing to the refusal of the latter to recognise Russian interests m the Russian sphere of influence in Persia. To this condition we should naturally have no objection, but we could hardly remain indifferent if, in return lor this recognition, any concessions were made by Russia to Germany in the neutral zone, buch a possibility would seem to be precluded by article 3 of the Persian Convention of 1907. We should certainly raise no objection to the opening of neo-otia- tions between Germany and Russia as to participation in the railway to the north of Bagdad, but we trust that the Russian Government would keep us informed of their progress.

The Russian Government are aware that His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople applied some weeks ago for a con cession for a railway from Bagdad to the Gulf by the valley of the Tigris with the option of prolonging it along the valley of the Euphrates from Bagdad to the Mediterranean. The Russian Government may also be aware that one of the conditions imposed by Eis Majesty* s Government for the acceptance of the 4 per cent surtax is that none of its proceeds is to be applied to the payment of kilometric guarantees and that the Porte is to obtain a written assurance from the German GovernmentGovernment in this sense # The Bagdad Railway Company realise that the required kilometric guarantees will not be forthcoming unless the Powers agree to the additional surtax on imports and unless its proceeds are devoted to them at least in part. Consequent- ~ly ^' 3 German Government are not likely to give the desired assurance. Two days ago I received a memorandum from Babington Smith at Constantinople giving an account of an interview he had with Gwinner in which the latter expressed his readi- —ness now to agree that the section of the Bagdad railway from Bagdad to the Gulf should be under British control and should be constructed by British agency and with British material, other interests taking only a subordinate shareand the British group having nothing to do with the line north of Bagdad. I have told the German Ambassador that we must oppose the increase of Turkish Customs dues failing an agreement about the Bagdad Railway and that one difficulty in parti- —ci pa ting in that, scheme is that Russian as well as French co-operation must be invited. We are now given to understand that the Germans might waive in our favour all rights to con- —struct their railway south of bagdad leaving it to us to make an arrangement with the Turks for a line from Bagdad t 0 the Gulf. This is what His Majesty’s Government hrve always demand- -ed and what it is imperative for British interests in Meso- - pot ami a to obtain. If this were conceded we ould probably l agree unconditionally, as other Powers including Russia seem inclined to do, to the increase of Turkish Customs dues and makemake no conditions as to participation in the Bagdad Railway. We should he much more interested in a railway going due west from Bagdad by a different route altogether than in the German lin; north of Bagdad. The question of increase of Turkish Customs dues has made decision urgent: for we cannot maintain opposition to increase of duties alone and if conceded this will place the Germans in a position to complete the Bagdad Railway.

The possibility of an English company asking for the concession of a railway from Koweit to Bagdad without requiring any guarantees has come to he knowledge of Hilmi Pasha, who does not himself favour the proposal. As however he thought that the Assembly might find it pleasing, he had spoken to the German Ambassador at Constantinople on the subject, and had proposed to him that an Ando- FrancQ-Gcrmaii combination should be made for the last section of the Bagdad Railwav The German Ambassador replied that, provided no difficulties were made to the German company coming to a final arrangement as to Bugurlou-Hilif section, he would recom mend such a combination to his Government. In reply to M. Isvolsky s question as to whether I had received any information as regards the above, I reminded him that he had made no objection when he was informed of the possibility of our asking for a railway concession. I added, however that the proposed combination a trois was entirely new to me. I told his Excellency that I would answei for my Government that we would not enter into conversation as to Bagdad Railway except a quatre, and that he could remain perfectly assured on thffi point.

Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling. (No. 355.) / Sir, Foreign Office, November 16, 1909. I HAVE received your despatch No. 889 of the 5th November, reporting that the plans for prolonging the Bagdad Railway eastward from Bulgurlu to Adana, Aleppo, and El Helif have received, in principle at any rate, the approval of the Turkish Government. It would appear from information received in this department from Sir A. Bloch, which is probably in your possession, that the revenues assigned by the Porte as guarantees for the interest on the railway loans, not including any of the proceeds of the prospective 4 per cent, increase of the customs duties, will suffice for the construc tion of Series II of the Bagdad Railway, but not for the construction of Series III. I have to request you to communicate to me your views as to how the Bagdad Railway Company propose to finance the construction of Series III of the railway. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.

War Office to Foreign Office.—[Received November 12.) (Confidential.) THE Director of Military Operations presents bis compliments to the Under secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs, and begs to forward, for bis information and retention, a copy of some notes on Alexandretta and the Bagdad Bailway which have recently been received in this department from Captain S. E. Newcombe, R.E. War Office, November 11, 1909. Inclosure in No. 1. Notes on Alexandretta and the Bagdad Railway, by Captain S. F. Newcombe, R.E. (Confidential.) ALEXANDRETTA is now probably twdce the size that is shown on the Admiralty chart, which contains small corrections up to 1904. The consul gave the estimate of population at 12,000. Compared to Mersina and some other places Alexandretta is clean, the streets fairly broad, having a good surface, and w^ell raised and drained. There are several moderately w T ell-built houses. Houses are within a feiv yards of the sea, which prevents a continuous road along the sea front. There are four or five small jetties; a new one, steel girders on cylinders, is now being built near the custom-house. It will be 100 metres long by 10 metres wide. The 6-fathom line is within 400 yards of the shore ; hence ships can get in fairly close. There is practically only one wind that causes any trouble to ships here; that is north-west, as the bay is protected from most quarters by the various hills. A breakwater thrown out for about a quarter of a mile from the point to the west of the town would afford ample protection in almost any weather, and should dredging be done, it would be possible at no great expense to enable ships to unload alongside a pier. If a railway be built from Alexandretta, the extra cost to enable direct loading would be well spent. At neither Mersina nor Ayas would this be possible except at greater expense, nor are these tw r o places at all well protected against storms. At present there are several lighters (about 30) and smaller boats to hold ten persons (60 to 100). The latter can come right up to the beach, and one can land anywhere from them, the beach being sand and gravel. The health of the town is said to have improved greatly, and fever is no longer prevalent. The marshes have not been filled in yet, nor can they be so wholly without great expense; but there is now no marsh within 100 yards or more of the town, and much of that shown on the chart as marsh is now town land and is filled in. The tramway for filling in is still worked, and two or three ditches drain the marshes. Some 4,000/. or mo r e is speut annually on filling in. Europeans or troops in large numbers could safely and easily live on the hills only 1 mile from the shore, and close to the springs where the water supply is derived. The site here is eminently healthy. In summer the local residents live some 10 miles out among the hills, hut they might also always live on these hills only 1 mile from the town. There is ample room for the town to expand, but expansion means filling in more marsh. After a certain point, however, a sloping plain w T ould he reached. The water supply is ample for a large town. There is a reservoir 1 mile from the shore, 4 feet deep by 100 feet by 100 feet. There are seven springs,one of which is used to supply the present 12,000 inhabitants. A pipe line is laid to the town from the spring. The quality of the water appears to he excellent. A stream was running from the springs at over 2 miles per hour, with a sectional area of 1 square yard, which gives 3,500 cubic yards per hour. This streap is perennial. Since Alexandretta mainly exists by the transport of goods to Aleppo, lar^e quantities of transport should be easily accessible, especially if the natives are well disposed. Mules, small, thin horses, camels, and carts are available. There does not seem to be a large supply of food, except cattle, in the neighbourhood. Grazing is good, but probably other forage is scarce. The stores will hold 4,000 to 5,000 tons. Fuel is scarce, but there are trees a tew miles out of the town. The tram wav engine consumes briquettes. Bailan Pass might be used as a summer camping ground, but a better place is Arnaouhsou, some 13 miles inland, 3,500 feet high, among pine trees, w r here water supply is excellent. The inhabitants in this vilayet are said to be distinctly well disposed to .the English. Most of this information was given me by M. Cattoni and the Khedivial ship’s captain. I spent two hours going round the town. Much more information would be found in the Foreign Office and Admiralty. S. F. KEWCOMBE. Information given by Mr. Weakly {Commercial Attache ).—The section from Bulgurlu to Adana is estimated by Mavrogordato, the engineer in charge, to cost 127,000,000 fr., the ruling gradient being 2 per cent, (or 1 in 50). The Germans want to bring the line near Tarsus and then proceed close to the present Mersina-Adana Railway, to avoid rough country near Adana. The Turks object to this, as they say it will create a new centre at the expense of Adana and Tarsus, besides taking traffic from the present Mersina-Adana Railway. They want the railway to come to Adana direct. From Adana two routes have been surveved :— (1.) Via Baghshe. (2.) Via Osmanieh, Payas, Alexandretta to Aleopo. This was surveyed as a direct result of M. Cattoni trying to get a concession to build, without guarantees, from Alexandretta to Aleppo. (]) costs 20,000,000 fr. more than (2) owing to necessity of twenty-fdur tunnels and viaducts through the Giaour I)agh, or else one tunnel 6 to 7 miles long, with the addition of water difficulties in the tunnel. From Adana to Alexandretta, excluding rolling-stock, is estimated at 240,000/. Trom Alexandretta to Aleppo is estimated at 1,360,000/., including rolling stock and including a tunnel of 4 to 5 kilom., estimated at 160,000/. The Germans therefore prefer to go via Alexandretta, but the Turks object to the line going along the coast from Payas to Alexandretta, and want the Geimans to build forts at Ras-el-Khanzu, Alexandretta, and Payas to protect the line. Ihe Germans say this is unnecessary, and in any case want to know the cost of such forts. Von der Goltz has told the Turks, on being referred to, that the forts are unnecessary. This subject and that of the entry to Adana are under discussion. irom the Bailan Pass it is uncertain whether to go north or south of the Lake of Antioch to Aleppo. Ihe better line goes south, but it will be necessary to drain the maish , this w r ould be simple, as the marsh is caused by three dams made to hold up watei loi three Turks who are now believed to be in exile. Thev could be bought out and the dams removed. A special geological professor came from Vienna to report on the rocks likelv to he met with in the Pailan Pass and Giaour Dagh in order to supply accurate information to arrive at an estimate of cost. Ihe line has been actually pegged out on a final alignment as far as Halef. ^ It is reported that the Germans are practically ready to begin now at Bulgurlu; a Geiman survey party was due to reach Mersina on the 15th October.3 are marked “ Bagdad^’*^ thk'n? 68 01 J 1 . tIie ^ersica-Adana Bail way now arriving from Niirnberg), fs presumably sZ^aZ ttu new engines (the latter j!ompany. ^ PP a tunds advanced by the Bagdad Railway Americans to bmld*raBways tn^he md proj ' ects now bein g P^t forward by I saw M.

The additional line to Adana from Bui aria taps no new country, and brings the railway no nearer Kaisariyeh, Nighde of r!Sff blS T ltre { S than 11 , 1S n0VV • and h is purel7 a q 1168 *' 011 of the manipulation slme o unn omu W -* 7° traffi ° WOuld s ° to Mersiaa - This section, then, costing soum o,u00,000/. itself, develops no new country. n T b e bne from Adana to Alexandretta would only be useful in developing smame Hamidieh,and that part, which can be easily done by producing the present Adana-Mersma Railway to the necessary places in the Cilieian plain. rom Alexandretta to Aleppo, however, it is generally accepted that a railwav would immediateiy pay. A study of consular reports would give some idea of the craae already developed, and which would be carried by such a railway. lurkey, being poor financially, cannot afford luxuries such as the Bio-dad Railway, and especially such a costly and unremunerative section as Bulgarin to Alexandretta. ° Germany would probably be quite willing to abandon these same sections, could s ic avoid building them, as the outlay will be very considerably greater than the4 fjgjgggggSBBSSBHBasBBUBBBSSsaaamHam guarantee unless she can undertake several other sections to make up the deficit; r and for these Turkey will probably he unable to supply the money for some years. If then, a financial group could he found to propose to Turkey and to Germany to reconsider their railway concession and to build with German assistance a railw^- that has prospects of immediate success, it is quite possible that a sound commercii settlement would be arrived at. Such a railway, and one recommended by several who know the country best, would he from Alexandretta to Diarhekir via Aleppo. This would develop some of the richest country, and, by assisting traffic towards Lake Van, might even attract the trade which now passes via Erzeroam and Trebizond. The strategic value is also considerable. Branches could be considered later as the country develops. The line might cost to Aleppo 1,360,000/. (as estimated by the Germans), and another 230 miles to Diarbekir at 7,000/. a mile gives, say, 3,000,000/. altogether for a useful line 300 miles long instead of a useless line 125 miles costing 5,000,000/. through the Taurus. . , J J ^ , Eor this line capital could probably be found without guarantees, certainly without kilometric guarantees. There °are, of course, several projects afloat, which presumably means there is capital forthcoming; and certainly 1VI. Cattoni is backed by financial people to a certain extent, and would build to Aleppo without financial guarantee. It is probable that now is a favourable time to put such a project forward. Herr von Gwinner’s article last July in the “ Contemporary Review” rather tends to show that the Germans would consider a sound commercial alternative to their present scheme in conjunction with others. The railway through the Taurus is not yet begun, but it is reported that everything is readv for an early start. There are two points of discussion between the Turks and Germans at present:— 1 . The Germans want the line to come down to a place near Tarsus, and then to go alongside the Mersina-Adana Railway to Adana, in order to save bad country. The Turks want the line to come direct to Adana, as they say a new junction would be created, which would lessen the importance of Tarsus and Adana, a question of vested interests. 2. Going round via Alexandretta necessitates the railway running from Fayas to Alexandretta along the seashore. The Turks say the Germans must build forts to protect this coast-line; the Germans object to doing this, and in any case wish to know what kind of forts and what expense will be required before they agree. Yon der Goltz, when referred to, said protection by forts is unnecessary. It would be a great opportunity lost if no one can be found to dome forward with some such scheme and in combination with the Germans commercially, rather than to allow' by sitting still a line to be built entirely under German control, and which benefits neither Turkey, Germany, nor ourselves, at least as regards commerce. _ S.

Extract from the “ Frankf urter Zeitung ” of November 2, 1909. The Continuation of the Bagdad Railway. (Translation.) “ ^ r ^ ls k e built after all! These words were originally uttered in reference to another German undertaking, which came to grief so miserably ; but they may really sately be applied to the Bagdad Railway. The proud work of civilisation which german enterprise undertook to create in Turkey is to be completed. The last few days have brought it considerably nearer realisation. Work on the Bulgurlu-El-Helif section can, according to a report received yesterday from Director von Gwinner be now begun. The continuation of the Bagdad Railway is assured. In June IpOS’it seemed already to have reached this point. After years of stagnation the signature of the conventions and financial agreements for the continuation o the construction of the railway was arrived at at the end of May 1908 between the representatives ol the Sultan and of the Bagdad Railway Company and the Deutsche t an ^- The great outstanding difficulties were overcome and all financial obstacles lemoved. Turkey placed at the disposal of the Bagdad Railway Company 227,000,000 fr [2489 h —4]of 4 per cent. State bonds for the provision of funds for the construction of the section 840 miles long ; the surplus of the so-called “ revenus concedes,” i.e., of the income hypothecated for the service of the old Turkish National Debt, and managed by the “ Dette Publique,” is intended as a security for it. The revolution in Turkey and th&lt;~^ debates which took place in the Turkish Parliament at the time regarding the Bagdaf Railway, and some hesitation in military quarters as to the route, gave rise to fresh delay. Rut now these difficulties have also been surmounted. The building plans have been sanctioned ; the constitution of the building company for the carrying out of the construction can now be proceeded with ; it is to be established, in Switzerland with a capital of 10,000,000 fr., and in its supervisory council German interests are to be represented by five members, French by four, Swiss by two, and Austrian by one. It is not as yet known to what degree each group will participate in the taking over of the total 227,000,000 fr. of the Turkish Bagdad Railway Loan ; the question is in any case not very pressing, as the period of construction of the section and the issue of the bonds are to be spread over a large number of years (formerly presumed to be six or seven). The section which the continued construction is to embrace is shown in the subjoined map. # As is well known the Bagdad Railway is to connect Constantinople with the Persian Gulf, and eventually to be extended across South Persia and Baluchistan to India. The Constantinople-Konia section belongs to the Anatolian Railway system. Of the Bagdad Railway itself, the Konia-Bulgurlu section has so far been built, which is 200 kilom. in length, and which culminates at the immediate foot of the Taurus mountains. The section which has now been sanctioned is 840 kilom. in length, and extends as far as El-Helif, and is later to be carried on 200 kilom. in a westerly direction to Mossul, touch the River Tigris there, and run along its banks as far as the Persian Gulf. Our second map* shows more clearly the Bulgurlu-El Helif section, which is to be undertaken now. This section is the most difficult of the whole railway, because it will have to cross the Taurus and Amanus ranges between Bulgurlu and Aleppo before reaching the plain of the Euphrates. At one time it was suggested that the railway, after crossing the Taurus should first run to Alexandretta and thence to Aleppo, but apparently the original plans are to be adhered to. The present section opens up for the Bagdad Railway not only a connection with Adana to the already existing section from Adana to the sea at Mersina, but also from Aleppo the connection with the Hedja Railway via Damascus, and to Mecca with the branch lines to seaport towns of Beirout and Haifa. With the completion of the 840 kilom. Bulgurlu-El-Helif section, the longest and most difficult part, 1,786 kilom. of the whole distance of 2,893 kilom. from Constantinople to Bussorah will have been overcome ; the remaining 1,155 kilom. of the line as far as Koweit are technically the simplest, and will not under the circumstances offer any very serious difficulties. * Not reproducedBAGDAD RAILWAY SECRET.

I explained to him the situation as follows :— Surplus of 1909-10, say Government’s share Less permanent charges Less floating charges* Remains £ T. 500.000 375.000 139.000 36,409 199,591 available for his railway, for which he requires as far as Aleppo &amp; 1. 200,000 as interest on construction loan, and, say, £ T. 44,000 for working expenses (2,500 fr., or £ T. 110 X 400 kilom., £ T. 44,000), or in all £ T. 244,000. As the Government onlv pays^when the railway is constructed and working, the money would probably not be required at that moment, and, if it was, there were supplementary guarantees, such as the sheep tax of the vilayets of Konia and Aleppo, on which a U .+.r tj SU ^ Q ^ ^ h ad been set free for forty years by the recent arrangement with Russia regarding the w T ar indemnity :— £ T. 500,000 .. 375,000 In 1910-11, taking the surpluses again at Government’s share Less permanent charges Remains And the same sum will be available in future years. 139.000 236.000 , ^ have kft out of account the advances of the Anatolian Railway Company on the supposition that °t ei anangements could be come to between the Government and the company as to the date and manner 0 ![ lr rei mbursement. They amount in all to £ T. 630,000, of which £ T. 300,000 is pavable after the annuity of Series II of the Bagdad Railway. [2523 /—l]This is almost sufficient for the Germans as far as Aleppo, and as soon as the reserve fund of the debt amounts to £ T. 2,000,000 (namely, in 1911) the interest thereof is paid into the general receipts, and the surpluses will increase by, say, £ T. 80,000, of which the share of the Government is £ T. 60,000 available again fo^*' the railway. M. Huguenin agreed with these figures, but he said that that would onhy take the Germans to Aleppo. For the next two sections there was no money, unless the revenues of the debt increased or unless when the definite contract came to be signed for these two sections the Turks gave fresh revenues. He thought that the debt revenues would gradually increase, but unless there was a modification of the tobacco monopoly or the spirits tax he did not foresee an increase which would provide the £ T. 220,000 for the third series (sections 4 and 5) for some time to come. He stated that the Germans would have the revenues arising from the creation of monopolies, which might help them. This, I admit, is new to me, but he spoke of it with assurance, and it is therefore of importance to Great Britain that when the monopolies are introduced the consent of His Majesty’s Government should only be given on condition that the product is to be applied to purposes of general State expenditure. From the above it is evident that in M. Huguenin’s opinion there is no chance yet of the surpluses of the debt revenues being sufficient for the fourth and fifth sections. In my opinion the following points should be kept in mind :— 1 . The construction of the fourth and fifth sections of the Bagdad railway is a matter of time, and it remains to be seen whether the Turkish Government will sign the definite contract for series 3 (sections 4 and 5) of the Bagdad railway loans with out demur. Under present conditions I don’t think they will be rushed, nor show any eagerness to set aside funds for the purpose. Series 2 is practically an accomplished fact, but Series 3 is a matter of “ longue haleine.” 2 . I consider that normally the Public Debt revenues will slowly increase, and will eventually suffice for sections 4 and 5. 3. There is a possibility of abnormal increase by altering the system of the tobacco monopoly or by modifying the tax on spirits. 4. In view of M. Huguenin’s uncertain attitude as to the destination of the 4 per cent, increase of Customs, a solemn declaration should be obtained from the Turkish Government that the product thereof shall not be assigned to the Bagdad railway either for sections 2 3, 4 and 5, or for other sections. 5. An engagement should be required from the Turkish Government that the existing 3 per cent., if ever it ceases to be specially applied to Macedonia, either before or after the expiration of seven years shall also not be assigned to the railway. 6. That the consent of the British Government to the creation of new monopolies should not be given unless the product of these new monopolies should be assigned to the general expenditure of the Empire, and not to the railway. These demands are the more legitimate that the Turkish budget of this year shows a deficit of £ T. 5,000,000, and will have to be covered by proceeds of loans or from extraordinary sources; not only will this be so this year, but perhaps for several years to come. To assign revenues for the Bagdad Railway under such circumstances would be an act of folly, which every Government desirous of seeing the establish ment of a sound financial policy in Turkey would be justified in pointing out and preventing. If the product of the 4 per cent, is to be applied to a loan it might be unofficially urged on the Porte that at least 50 per cent, of the loan shall be placed in London. The 4 per cent, might produce a loan of, say, £ T. 20,000,000. British trade is by far the most important in Turkeyy and it would not be fair to give French or German houses an opportunity of a large lucrative and sound operation with money derived chiefly from British trade. It is in my opinion advisable that the 4 per cent, should pass through the hands of the debt, as the 3 per cent, does, under the decree of Mouharrem. I think the French and the German Governments would agree to this if they were approached ; probably also Italy and Austria, as by this means 25 per cent, of the money would go to the extra ordinary sinking fund of the Unified Debt and Lots Turcs. The advantage to the Turks is twofold— [a.) Increased security for the loan, and hence better terms ; (6.) Increased rapidity in the amortisation of the debt, and in regaining their financial independence.3 who did not seem averse to ^he 0 striet^obse'* 111 *^ 6 r° th - e i P resent Minister of Finance, Mouharrem, although lie said it would ! ’ el Y £ J' lee ot article 8, section 3 of the decree of mo per cent, of the 4 per cent 1 0Ons, “y the amount of the loan Pposes.

CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum of Sir H. Babington Smith’s Conversations with Dr. Gwinner. {Communicated to Sir E. Cassel by Sir H. Babington Smith.) Railway GWIN NER introduced the subject of British co-operation in the Bagdad He traced the history of the previous negotiations on the subject, and said that while he was confident that the line would be finished in course of time without British co-operation, he believed that with British co-operation it would be completed at an earlier date. He was therefore still desirous to have that co-operation [2489 p—1]He paid that he would be prepared now to agree that the section from Bao-dad to the Persian Gulf, Koweit, or elsewhere, should be under British control, and should be constructed by British agency and with British material, the other interests only takinr a subordinate share. It would be necessary to obtain the assent of the Turks to such arrangement, but he believed that there would be less difficulty about this under the present than under the old regime. I asked what relation the British group would have to the rest of the line He said that the arrangement for that had been made, and that he thought the simplest plan would be to divide the enterprise into two parts at Bagdad. He therefore proposed that the British group should have nothing to do with the line north of Bagdad. 1 pointed out that in order to complete the line to Bagdad a very large annual sum would be required as guarantee, and that it appeared to me that it would be a very long- time, if not an indefinite time, before the Turks would be able to assume this heavv burden. J Dr. Gwinner said that he looked to the increase in the customs duties to provide the money. He was aware that the British Government had declined to give their assent unless a pledge were given that the revenues should not be applied to the Bagdad Bailway. The Germans, on the other hand, desired that they should be so applied. The Grand Vizier had spoken to him of the dilemma in which they were placed and he Dr. Gwinner, had suggested to the Grand Vizier that a solution was to be tound m British co-operation on the basis of British control of the Bagdad-Gulf section. &amp; I then pointed^ out that the type of railway now being constructed was unnecessarily expensive, that if the gauge were reduced and a more economical type of construction adopted the guarantee at present provided for four sections (840 kflom from Bulgourlou onwards) would suffice to take the railway to Bagdad. • , r ' ^winner admitted that the type of railway was unnecessarily costly, especially m the laurus section. He had endeavoured to persuade the Turks under the old regime to accept more economical curves and gradients for this section. They had however, declined, and he was unwilling to enter upon a new negotiation because it v ould give hostile interests an opportunity for opposition. I pointed out that if an^ agreement were arrived at for co-operation this reason would cease to exist. Dr. Gwrnner assented, but, while admitting that economies might h6 Str0ng1 ^ ob j ected t0 a chan g e of g au £ e &gt; and antici- pated that the Turks would object on military grounds. He added that England, while m-plT h t Ve a ra r way from . t ! ) ® Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, would, he supposed, prefer a change of gauge, which would be an obstacle to the use of the line for military purposes or troops coming from Europe. ^ „ n j TGd n °u V: sy fiual answer as t0 the possibility of a cheaper type of line; anv V? ^ V ^ V® SU pestion was merely from myself, and that I was not in that ::*^r ed *4 ma t e 0r , aCCe P fc P ro P° sa,s of any kind.

I thought it well to say that this scheme had not been devised or put forward in any way as a means of opposing the Bagdad Bailway.

I ASKED Count Metternich to come to see me to-day. irritation ^°T e ^ ° M the Ba g dad Kailway as one of the tilings icii caused irritation. I would therefore take this opportunity of explaining e^t v ^ 4 per Cent 'Turkish P cu S tomf duties witnout a promise that the additional revenue would not be used for thp TWrlnrl Railway. About one-third of the increase of the duties would fa f on B his! fot merce, and this m itself would be much disliked. But, if the money thus secured “t he expense of British trade was to be used to make a new through-route to the East and to establish means of communication which would superseded! others in carndng trade from the Persian Gulf into Mesopotamia, and all this under the exclusive control of one foreign Power, then the position of a British Government which had agreed to this would become untenable. It was therefore impossible for us to agree to the increase of the Turkish customs duties unless we had proper safeguards against the use, of the additional revenue for the purpose of displacing British trade in Mesopotamia. VV e felt that we must either have a part in the Bagdad Railwav itself or else we must have a concession which would enable us to establish other means of communication by which we couhl trade with Mesopotamia on equal terms. With regard to the participation of France and Russia in the Bagdad Railway new that Count Metternich had objected to a discussion d quatre, because such a discussion would put Germany in a minority. But I explained to him that this had^ not been our object in proposing the discussion. French financiers had already an interest m the project before I came into office, and it was certainly not I who had brought them in. As regards Russia, the position was this. We had on previous occasions been instrumental, or been supposed to be instrumental, in efeatmg the Russian plans for securing outlets on the sea, first in the case of the Mediterranean, and then in the case of the Far East; this had caused much ill-wdl m Russia towards us. Now we had succeeded in overcoming t us ill-will, and I was very anxious not to revive it as regards the one remaining outlet which Russia was thought to desire—the Persian Gulf—by participating in the Bagdad Railway, when Russia was opposed to it and excluded from it. I had told the Russian Government more than once that I thought they ought not to oppose, in principle, the construction of the Bagdad Railway, but ought instead to make up their mmds as to the terms on which they could join in the project. I did not think it would be impossible for the German Government to overcome this difficulty of Russian opposition ; indeed, I knew that before the visit of the German Emperor to this country Herr von Schoen had spoken to the Russian Government on the subject. I told Count Metternich that my object in giving these explanations to the German Government was to prove to them that our action was not dictated by ill-will to Germany, but by the necessities of the case, and that the attitude we were obliged to take up with regard to the increase of the Turkish customs duties was not an attitude taken up behind the back of the German Government in a way to cause irritation and introduce friction into what w T e hoped would be a friendly discussion. Count Metternich replied that there would be no objection to British financial co-operation in the Bagdad Railway, but Germany must have the control; in the sense of having a majority on whatever Railway Board controlled the line. He asked me whether we should be satisfied with some measure of control on the southern section of the railway. I told him it was the southern part that interested us principally. He asked how much we meant by the southern section, because he thought that the part of the line that went through Mesopotanua would probably prove to be the most valuable part of the wdiole line. I replied that this was a question for experts at a later stage in the discussion. Count Metternich observed that the Bagdad Railway did not, as it was at present [2460 ee—2] lintended, touch Russian territory, or prevent Russia from making a separate 01 tl t f herself to the Persian Gulf. * or I said that this was no doubt the case, but in my opinion the Russian needs la best be met not by the making of a separate route to the Gulf, but by establi V d under Russian control, connections with the Bagdad Railway. This would mVo p an interest in the outlet created by the Bagdad Railway. ^ Russia Count Metternich asked whether, if participation was arranged for us d, i, be willing that the additional revenue secured by the 4 per cent increase ZuK used to make the Bagdad Railway. u Dt I answered that if we came to an agreement about participation we aim,, 1,1 ,,f course, not wish to hinder the progress of the railway ; but we had promised the Z regime in Turkey that we would not apply for any kilometric guarantees in connection with concessions m which we were interested, and therefore we could not mess Z Turkish Government to allocate any more of their funds to kilometric guarantees T thridagcTaZ Railway der ^ ^ ^ qUeStWn WaS mvolved in the further progress of I am, &amp;c.fa L^/ff n Immediate ^\and Confidential.

I added that should such a concession be granted, a substantial syndicate would be forthcoming without delay to discuss details with the Ottoman Government. replied that personally he would favour such a scheme, but he would have to consult all his colleagues individually and confidentially before laying the matter before the Cabinet. H6 hoped however to give me a reply in a weeks time. His Highness added however His Highness took notes of the proposal andthat he could not conceal from me that the granting 0 f such a ooncession would be deeply resented by Germany who would probably #eize every opportunity of injuring this country both internally and externally as a punish ment for the granting of the concession to Great Britain, and Turkey would then have to rely more than ever on England to help her out of such difficulties. There was no disguising the fact that this country was not yet in a strong or independent position. He likened its efcate to that of a severe wound which had been festering for years, and which was cicatrizing sucassfully, but the slightest rupture of the skin might retard its healing for a long period. He hoped we would understand that they mist not run any risks of the wound being reopened. I observed that, the proposed concession was not in contravention to the Bagdad Railway convention, and Germany would have no more right to resent suche concession being granted than she would have to resent the acceptance of the Glasgow and other railway scheaes which have recently bean put forward, which opened up a different part of the country from that which it was contemplated the Bagdad Railway would open up.

Sir ’ Bagdad, July 9,190$. , 7 ^CRWAKDEDto your Excellency, as enclosure No. 3 to my despatch No. 251/25, dated the 10th March, 1909, a memorandum drawn up by Sir William Willcocks on the advantages ^of establishing direct railway communication between Bagdad and Alexandretta via Aleppo. I have now the honour to enclose a further memorandum by Sir William dealing with the same subject, with the practicability of railway com munication between Bussorah and Bagdad, and also with the terms on which money might be raised for a railway and for the Kut Barrage. I understand that Sir Ernest Cassel is at the present time the financier who is most likely to take a leading part in any negotiations for rendering pecuniary assistance to Turkey, that Sir William has worked with him for many years in Egypt, and that consequently Sir William’s opinion on the question of security for a loan or for money spent are likely to carry great weight. I think it is fortunate that he has suggested a method by which the capitalists and the Turkish Government will be partners ; for such proposals, if accepted, will convince the Government that, in the best expert opinion, the schemes proposed are sound. If objection is taken to placing so much land as Sir William proposes in the hands of foreign capitalists, it could no doubt be arranged that the land should be sold in small lots within a given period, say, fifty years. Regarding the Aleppo-Alexandretta section of the railway, there is one point to which I have not seen any allusion. The Germans, under the terms of their concession, have a right to take their line to Aleppo, and they have certain qualified rights to the construction of any line joining their railway to the sea. As far as I can understand they would have no concessional right if it was decided to join Alexandretta to the Aleppo-Beyrouth Railway, say, to take an extreme case, half a mile south of Aleppo, for in that case the line to Alexandretta would not be joining the German Railway to the sea. I have, &amp;c. J. RAMSAY, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Bagdad. [2378 z—4]Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Further Memorandum by Sir W. Willcocks on Possible Railway Communications ^ in Mesopotamia. I WRITE this in continuation of my memorandum on the true development of Mesopotamia depending on a line of railway from Bagdad to Alexandretta, via Aleppo Every day I live in the country the more am I impressed with the truth of this statement. After careful examination of the question of railway communication between Bagdad and Bussorah, I have come to the conclusion that there are only two alignments possible. The first, via Museyib, Karbala, Nedjef, Ur, and Zobeir, to Bussorah, which is practically the line of the proposed German Bagdad Railway; the other via Koot the Hai branch to Nasria, Ur, and Zobeir to Bussorah. Swamps, deserts, marshes and inundations, would interfere with any other alignment; but the above two could be constructed fairly cheaply and maintained at reasonable cost. The first might be constructed to-day, but would be a very unremunerative line, except in the reach from Bagdad to Nedjef. The line via Kut and the Hai would be of no value until the irrigation of the country was undertaken, which would immediately follow the con struction of the Kut Barrage. Both lines of railways would have to compete heavily with river transport in an exceedingly flat country (Bagdad is only 115 feet above sea level), where navigation would become very cheap the moment regular freights offered i • coni Pp^ t / on supervened. In this connection it might be useful to note the question ol liquid fuel and the development of the oil fields on the Karun River. The present cost of transport by water is no gauge of what may be expected under altered conditions • ior boats which lie idle for months at a time, and then have sudden demands made on them, exist on extraordinarily high rates. With ihe best information at my disposal I estimate as follows: By river from Bagdad to Xut is L'20 miles, from Kut to Bussorah, via Amarah, along the present course of the Tigris is 255 miles, or 505 miles in all. Taking the river route along the Hai from Bagdad to Kut is 220 miles, from Kut to Bussorah along the Hai and the new channel which the Euphrates is cutting out for itself is 225 miles, or 445 miles m an A line of railway from Bagdad to Kut, along the right bank of the Tigris, would ./-jP ( miles, Kut to Nasria 110 miles, Nasria (Ur) to Bussorah via Zobeir 90 miles, or BIO miles m ail As the railway must of necessity run parallel to and near a navigable river in this flat delta of the Euphrates, where the fall from Bagdad to Bussorah in 500 miles is only 110 feet the competition would be exceedingly severe. . , ie 'bys between Kut and Bussorah, as it exists to-day, is a very poor river for navigation. Leaving Kut with a width of about 1,000 feet and depth of 25 feet, before reaching Amarah it loses five-sixths of its water in flood times, owing to overflows and deep offcasts, of which the Batera on the right and Chala on the left are the principal; Betwl ^ u 6 7^, h ^ 0U \ 500 feet ’ but river is comparatively shallow! branchTs^Uoverfl KlIa Sateh it loses nearlythe whole of its water through numerous ind ?he r T’ A whl ?k, th . e prmcipal are the Majer Kebir on the right IS , ® Atal anta on the left, while its channel dwindles down to a width of about of Elah S^lh fed P m fl0 ° d t0 10 *’ and aW 6 feet at low water.

The development of these lands will be hurried up by a cut from the Euphrates to the Khor Abdulla, where the mean sea level is two feet lower than it is at Bussorah, and by which a navigable connection will probably be soon established with the Persian Gulf through the Khor (see the 3-fathom line on the map). s I inclose a map.

WITH reference to your Excellency’s despatch No. 375, dated the 25th May, 1909, to the Foreign Office, I have the honour to submit for your Excellency’s consideration a memorandum dealing with the question of direct railway communication between Bagdad and the Mediterranean Sea. I have, &amp;c. J. RAMSAY, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Bagdad. Inclosure 4 in No. 1. Memorandum by Consul-General Ramsay. I HAVE received a copy of his Excellency the Ambassador’s despatch No. 375, dated the 25th May, 1909. There are one or two points on which I am afraid that I did not make myself sufficiently clear in my original despatch No. 251/25, dated the 10th March, 1909, and as the matter is a very important one I venture to offer some further explanations and remarks for his Excellency’s consideration :— («•) I did not mean so much that the Germans would be able to manipulate rates to such an extent as to make the all German route the cheaper, but that they could by charging high rates on the Aleppo-Alexandretta section unreasonably increase the freight, and consequently reduce the price of produce in Mesopotamia, and with it the return on irrigation works. To make the all German route actually the cheaper would probably not suit them, but it would be delightfully simple for them to levy a heavy toll on all goods passing to the sea. (b.) Sir Gerard Lowther has assumed that if the French and German railways come to terms about the Aleppo-Alexandretta Railway the former will certainly stipulate for favourable tariff treatment. If the matter was not of great publicimportance I should not venture to question the correctness of this assumption ; but in the circumstances I humbly suggest that the assumption may not be correct. Suppose the through rates on the Aleppo-Alexandretta section are lowered, as has been assumed ; what is likely to be the effect of this on the French port of Beyrouth and on the Beyrouth-Rayak section of the railway ? I understand that Alexandr^F* has great natural advantages over Beyrouth, and if the former becomes the tenninusr^ two great trunk lines from Haidar Pasha and Bagdad there is little doubt that the artificial facilities will be superior to those at Beyrouth. Also the larger traffic will attract more tonnage, and it seems to me that the result of cheap rates on the Aleppo- Alexandretta line would be to ruin Beyrouth and the Lebanon section. It appears much more likely that the German and French, if they come to terms at all, will agree to very high rates on the Aleppo-Alexandretta section. By this means less injury would be done to Beyrouth and the Lebanon Railway, while the Germans would console themselves for small losses on this account by cutting into the profits of the Bagdad-Aleppoy Railway, and of the irrigation works. I think, therefore, that unless we make an effort to get this line for ourselves, or for the Turks' or for others on conditions as to freights which are reasonable, we stand in danger of letting others reap where we have sown (and watered). (c.) Even in the matter of minimum freights I think that the Germans must have a good deal up their sleeves. The through rate for grain in bulk is 6 paras a ton a kilometre = 9 prs. 6 p. a mile. The £ T. = 4,000 paras for railway purposes, and if it is 9‘6 18 X 12 taken to be worth 185., ^qqq X j = -5184 pence a mile. The average Indian rate for all goods carried, small and great, long distances and short, is *421 pence a mile. (d.) If existing rights on the Alexandretta-Aleppo line hamper us too much, we can turn the flank of both German and French competitors and give most valuable assistance to the Turkish Railway by taking our line from Deir to Damascus, thence to join the line to Haifa. I see that the Damascus Trade Report for 1892 describes Haifa as a partially protected harbour. J.

Colonel Ramsay dwells with some insistence on the necessity, for the success of the scheme under discussion, of preventing the German Bagdad Hallway Company from acquiring the Concession for the line between Aleppo and Alexandretta, for, he argues the German Company, if they obtained it, would be enabled, by applying over this section the maximum tariff permitted by their “ cahier des charges/’ to maintain through rates for goods carried by the Euphrates Valley Eailway to Alexandretta at a figure higher than for similar goods carried by the all German line, and thus secure the latter against effective competition. I am not convinced that this apprehension is well grounded. The German Company possesses its preference for the line connecting Aleppo with the sea only on condition that the prior similar rights of the Damascus- Hamah-Biredjik Eailway are respected (see Young’s “ Corps de Droit ottoman,” vol. 4, pp. 166-7 and 228). Now supposing the French Company is willing to cede its right, it seems to me certain that whatever other conditions they may attach to ^the Agreement, they would certainly stipulate for favourable treatment in tariff matters for themselves, and in such case it is hard to conceive that the Turkish Government would not insist on equally favourable treatment for any railway starting from Aleppo for which they might grant a Concession. Thus, though no doubt serious, I doubt wdiether the_ competition of the Bagdad Eailway would be as formidable as Colonel Eamsay anticipates, especially when the advantage which the Euphrates valley line would possess in its shorter route is taken into account. However this may be, there can be no question but that it would be desirable that the Concession for this important line should be in the hands of more friendly parties than the Bagdad Eailway is likely to prove. Perhaps, if there were a reasonable prospect that the French Eailway Company and the French financial houses interested in it were disposed to follow' a policy more m harmony with that of their Government, some arrangement with the Damascus- Hamah-Biredjik Company might offer a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. I hear, however, that the saying “ L’argent n’a pas de patrie ” is of too true application in Paris to allow of hopes in this direction. Colonel Eamsay also suggests that, thanks to the double guarantee, for construction loan and for working expenses, which the Bagdad Bailway enjoys under its Concession, that Company could 'without loss to itself lower rates to a point 'which a less favoured rival Company could not afford. This in practice would probably prove to be the case, hut this advantage again is considerably neutralized by the shorter route along the Euphrates valley. It appears to me also that there is a limit beyond which the German Company could not cut rates, and that limit would be reached when the kilometre receipts of the line were so reduced as to fall below 4,500 fr., the amount of the working expenses guarantee, and the Turkish Treasury became liable to make good the difference. [2298 a—1] Bi In any case it seems indubitable that the ;Germans will make a strong effort to obtain a concession of the Alexandretta-Aleppo line. It did not need the debate on the Bagdad Railway Concession to show the Germans what the country at large think of the bargain they succeeded in making with the late Sultan, for the Germans hack already hastened to assure the Minister of Public Works of their readiness to discus! that instrument, and, if need be, to modify it, but, so far as I am aware, no definite proposal for a basis of discussion has been put forward on either side. The Germans however, will hardly consent to make a concession without some quid pro quo and an alteration of the /race of the railway so as to bring Alexandretta and Aleppo on to the mam line, which they can colourably represent as being a modification as much in favour of turkey as of the Company, will assuredly be one of their requirements. On the other hand they are still less likely to abandon the whole of the advantages in the nature of guarantees they now possess, and as Turkey, with the resources at present available to her, is quite unable to provide even for a reduced expenditure under that head, it seems probable that negotiations between the Company and the Government will be deferred until the latter has obtained the consent of the Powers to an alteration of the existing Customs regime. In conclusion, I would hazard the opinion that whatever may be the prospect of a Euphrates Valley Railway, such as advocated by Colonel Ramsay as a purely com mercial enterprise, the unsettled political condition of this country is likely to deter capitalists from engaging m so important an enterprise without some assured guarantee at East for the interest on the capital invested. To expect Turkey to furnish this would I fear be mvam but it seems to me that in view of the magnitude of the interests involved it would be worth while carefully to examine whethef the prospects “A r ffV; y ^ V g° od *0 warrant His Majesty’s Government in recmfred for If onW ., re f 11 ° f such . exami . n ? tlon favourable the annuity should be securing to theV-e f and .P ro .

It is questionable whether these rates are ever likely to be reduced by any material amount. The British Kiver Steamer Company, I am informed, only declares a dividend of 12 per cent. (I must confess that I find this difficult to understand), and a shrewd man of business who has been many years in Bagdad tells me that he doubts if the present rates can be profitably reduced, because when harvests are bad, or when all expoit of gram is prohibited, the steamers practically get no cargo on the downward journey. As legalds Sea Steamer Companies, all authorities seem to agree that the Hamburg-American Line has been losing money on its Persian Gulf service, and the British Steamer Companies have been urging that they cannot indefinitely continue to compete at the present lates unless they get some Government assistance. As regards this service, too, there seems little likelihood of large reductions of charges, because the conditions aie such as to tell against low freights the journey is a dangerous one through unlighted seas, the climate is very trying, the Suez Canal dues have to be paid both on the outward and the homeward voyage, and serious delays are often caused by insufficiency of water on the bar at the mouth of the Shat-ul-Arab, as well as by an entire absence of harbours in the Persian Gulf. Owing to lack of protection cargo cannot be worked in bad weather, and three steamers are maintained at Bussorah to lighten steamers crossing the bar. More than half the import trade of Bagdad passes on to Persia via Khanakin, and for transport from Bagdad to Khanakin we must add about 205 . a-ton to the above rates, plus the cost of handling the cargo at Bagdad. 3. I believe that with cheaper freights and better means of communication our trade in Turkey would very largely increase, and it is obvious that cheaper freights will enable our trade to compete in the more distant parts of Persia. If a railway to the Mediterranean is desirable in existing circumstances, it will be readily admitted that it is absolutely essential to the success of any large irrigation projects. Sir William Willcocks has now had sufficient time to make a detailed study of the country, and I understand from him that nowhere in the world could more promising projects be proposed. He estimates that 6,000,000 acres can eventually be brought under perennial irrigation, and that by using occasional rises in the river, and what would otherwise be the surplus water of the high floods, he will be able to flood 10,000,000 acres more, when needed, and so enormously increase the grazing capacity of the country. This is a very important point, for the country is eminently suited to the raising of sheep and cattle, owing to the large quantities of lime in the soil and water and also because the pastoral population is present to take advantage of any grazing facilities afforded. An increase in grazing seems desirable on political as well as commercial grounds, for it will bring the pastoral population into touch with the agricultural population and so, by force of example, lead them to the more profitable occupation. Even if Sir William Willcocks’ figures are many times too sanguine to be realized in the near future, it is clear that any serious irrigation works will need an economical outlet to the chief consuming markets. In ordinary years all the surplus produce will go by the Mediterranean, but when there is a famine in India it would be of great value to that country to be able to draw on such a granary as Mesopotamia. There is already a considerable trade in animals from the Vilayets of Bagdad and Bussorah to Aleppo. Animals are marched up all the way, they are liable to be robbed or to die, and I am told that it is not an unknown thing for the whole herds or flocks to disappear, yet the trade is profitable. From the Consular Beport for Aleppo for the year 1907 it appears that 191,512/. worth of sheep and cattle were annually shipped to Egypt from Alexandretta during 1903—7, and no doubt this trade could be largely^4 increased if grazing was improved here and if animals could be sent cheaply and s f 1 to the sea coast. On one occasion a man applied to me for a special escort for 2 000 a of cattle that he was marching from Bagdad to Aleppo, and a Bagdad merchant is engaged m the trade, has given me the following estimate of the number of an’ which annually pass through Bagdad on the way to Aleppo : nuny Sheep Cattle 10,000 to 15,000 9,500 to 14,000 The proposition that irrigation works must be supported by a railway to the sea so obvious that I have perhaps already said more than was needed. The point whU wish to emphasize is that what is wanted is an outlet on the Mediterranean r-ol, than an outlet in the Persian Gulf. uuerranean ri * ther 4.

J 3 ir i e s ® rvin g irrigation works carried out under British engineers should not be m J f l i ulC f l . other nation. I presume that the money for the irrigation works will be tound in England, and if this is correct we must insure as far as possible that our enterprise is not taxed by others. We know that there is abundance of water, a vas expanse o eitile soil, ^ and that the levels are almost ideally convenient; consequen y e only undetermined factor in the problem is the cost of gettino- produce to the European market. As the difficulties to be overcome are not the same for all sections, it seems desirable to examine each section separately :— Alexandretta-Aleppo Section. The first thing on this section is to obtain permission to make any harbour improvements that may be required at Alexandretta. Under their Concession of 1903 the Germans have no rights in the port of Alexandretta. From Alexandretta to Aleppo there was no engineering difficulty that could not easily be o\eicome in 1872, and engineering and mechanical science has since then made much advance. The chief difficulty lies in the engagements which have already been made between the Turkish Government and the French and German railways which are to join at Aleppo. A i tide 12 of the German Concession stipulates that should the Government decide on the construction of branches joining the “ line which forms the object of the present Convention to the sea between Mersina and Tripoli it can give the Concession exclusively to the Germans provided that due consideration shall be given to the existing rights of the French railway. I have not been able to obtain a copy of the French Concession, but I understand that Article 36 of the Concession gives to the French Company a right of preference on equal terms over any branches joining their line to the sea. As far as the German Concession is concerned it seems clear that the Turkish Government is free to make a railway from Alexandretta to Aleppo should it wish to do so, provided it gives no concession to a third party, otherwise than in accordance with the French Concession. Without having seen the text of the French Concession I can express no opinion as to the rights of the French Company. 9. According to Article 21 (9) of the “ cahier des charges” of the German Con cession cereals in full waggon loads, booked for not less than 900 kilom. are carried at 6 paras per ton per kilom., while the rate for cereals booked under other conditions is 22 paras per kilom. per ton. The rate for sheep is 4 paras per head per kilom. and that for cattle is 27 paras per head per kilom. In the case of sheep and cattle I have not found any provision for a reduction of rates on long distances. Sesame is charged 35 paras per kilom. per ton, with no provision for reduction in case of long distances. The whole classification of merchandise should, in my opinion, be examined by a traffic expert with a view to seeing how it could he used to injure a direct railway from Bagdad to Aleppo. To take one instance. If the Germans construct the Alexandretta-Aleppo Hallway, and the branch from El Bajh to Hit, the distance from Hit to Alexandretta will be, approximately, as shown below, taking the railway as a straight line from point to point, in both cases : Hit to Aleppo .. .. .. ..

As the possession by the Germans of the Aleppo-Alexandretta section would injure the westward traffic along^ a Euphrates valley railway, so the possession of the Sadija-Khanakm branch would injure all British trade with Persia. It is therefore most impoi tant that we should obtain control of this section if possible. The control of the Bagdad—Keibela—Bussorah section is not so important commercially if there is an alternate line on the other bank of the Euphrates, but the control of this section is required on political grounds which have many times been discussed. 12. Sii William Willcocks has represented to the Minister for Public Works the necessity which exists for the lurkish Government to retain freedom of action in the matter of the Aleppo—Alexandretta Railway. Sir William has also written a “private” Memorandum containing his views on this railway. I inclose a copy of this document as Appendix No. 3. I believe that Sir William has sent a copy of this document to some of his capitalist friends in England with a view to stimulating their interest in a scheme which he intends to urge on the attention of financiers when he visits England this summer. 13. The arguments which I have tried to develop may be briefly summarized as follows :— (1.) The regeneration of Turkey depends upon financial assistance to be obtained from Mesopotamia. (2.)^ The success of irrigation works in Mesopotamia depends upon direct railway communication with the Mediterranean. (3.) If the Germans obtain the management of the Aleppo-Alexandretta line they will be able to reap large profits, which fairly belong to the irrigation works. (4.) If the port of Alexandretta is also in their hands their position will be even more dominant. (5.) Neither the German nor the French Concessions make it impossible for the Turkish Government to make a railway from Aleppo to Alexandretta, which can be under British management. (6.) There is nothing to prevent a direct Bagdad-Aleppo line. (7.) The Germans in possession of the Khanakin-Sadija branch will be able to tax our trade with Persia. (8.) The Germans in possession of the Bagdad-Bussorah section will be able to tax all our trade with India and our sea-borne trade with Europe unless we have an alternative line on the left bank of the Euphrates. (9.) Until improvements are made, steamer freights are not likely materially to decrease. (10.) The irrigation of Mesopotamia will be a protection for India against famine. (11.)

Babylonia, I HAVE been very carefully examining the country between Samarra and Babylon (Hilla) past Bagdad and Ctesiphon, and have had a special opportunity owing to the fact that I am spending 30,000/. on the repairs of the Hindiya Barrage, and the first thing that strikes one is the fact that all possibility of the real development of this country depends as much on a railway direct from Bagdad to the nearest port on the Mediterranean as on irrigation. The best route is Bagdad, Hit, Ana, Deir, Aleppo, Alexandretta; and the next best is Bagdad, Hit, Ana, Deir, Palmyra, Damascus, Beirout. These are the two real trade routes of this country. Both are under 600 miles. Nearly everything we produce goes to Europe, and very much of it to the Eastern Mediterranean countries, and what we chiefly want are European goods and cheap coal. This is a country strangely devoid of fuel, and we pay for coal in Bagdad 3/. lo^. per ton by the time it has gone through the Suez Canal to Bussorah and come up the 520 miles of the Tigris. Now, if we had a railway from the Mediterranean we should have coal here as cheap at any rate as at Assouan, which is considerably more than 600 miles from Alexandria. The railway, moreover, which ran from Beirout or Alexandretta here would have cheap coal bought on the Mediterranean and not dear stuff bought in Bussorah and Bagdad. The Euphrates valley is very rich, and can be irrigated, and is irrigated, very cheaply by water power the whole way, and the current is strong enough to turn wheels and lift water. It is too strong for navigation. We here are a great grain-producing country with unlimited capabilities for extension, and the whole goes to the Eastern Mediterranean or Europe. What, however, has struck me more than anything, and I am forming my projects accordingly, is the fact that this country is even more a sheep and cattle and horse-breeding country than a granary. We can irrigate with the supply of the river 6,000,000 acres, but we can irrigate, in addition, as pastures 10,000,000 acres on which millions of sheep and cattle could feed. All these would go west. In a year of drought like this sheep are worth a song, because they cannot be got out of the country (and droughts are common here). If we had a railway to the Mediterranean direct the transport for sheep ancE, . winter, ana then would come ih* h, wheat, barley, and winter cereals, and then the summer harvest of rice drl T T™ 61 ot all going west. ancl Indian corn Turnips for feeding are grown over large areas and could be erown * thousands by irrigation the day we have weirs.

Ramsay, C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty^ Consul-General, Baghdad, H.

I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of my despatch No. dated 9th July 1909, which I have addressed to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. 2. The last reference to this subject is my letter No. 253, dated the 10th No. 7 ^ 5 , dated Baghdad, the 9th July 1909. From— Lieutenant-Colonel J. Ramsay, C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad, To— His Excellency the Right Honourable Sir Gerard Lowther, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople. I forwarded to Your Excellency as enclosure No. 3 to my despatch No. 5 2 - 5 -, dated the 10th March 1909, a memorandum drawn up by Sir William Willcocks on the advantages of establishing direct railway communi cation between Baghdad and Alexandretta vid Aleppo. 1 have now the honour to enclose a further memorandum by Sir William, dealing with the same subject, with the practicability of railway communication between Basrah and Baghdad, and also with the terms on which money might be raised for a railway and for the Kut Barrage, I understand that Sir Ernest Cassell is at the present time the financier who is most likely to take a leading part in any negotiations for rendering pecuniary assistance to Turkey, that Sir William has worked with him for many years in Egypt, and that consequently Sir William’s opinion on the question of security for a loan or for money spent are likely to carry great weight. I think it is fortunate that he has suggested a method by which the capitalists and the Turkish Government will be partners : for such proposals, if accepted, will convince the Government that, in the best expert opinion, the schemes proposed are sound. If objection is taken to placing so much land as Sir William proposes in the hands of foreign capitalists, it could no doubt be arranged that the land should be sold in small lots within a given period, say, fifty years. Begarding the Aleppo-Alexandretta section of the railway there is one point to which I have not seen any allusion. The Germans under the terms of their concession have a right to take their line to Aleppo, and they have certain qualified rights to the construction of any line joining their railway to the sea. As far as I can understand they would have no concessional right if it was decided to join Alexandretta to the Aleppo-Beyrouth Railway, say, to take an extreme case, half a mile south of Aleppo, for in that case the line to Alexandretta would not be joining the German railway to the sea. Further Note on 'possible Failway communications in Mesopotamia. I write this in continuation of my memorandum on the true development of Mesopotamia depending on a line of railway from Baghdad to Alexandretta rid Aleppo. Every day I live in the country the more am I impressed with the truth of this statement. After careful examination of the question of railway communication between Baghdad and Basrah I have come to the conclusion that there are only two alignments possible. The first vid Mnseyib, Karbala, Nedjef, Ur and Zobeir to Basrah, which is practically the line of the proposed German Baghdad Railway; the other ria Kut, the Hai branch to Nasria, Ur and Zobeir to Basrah. Swamps, deserts, marshes and inundations would interfere with any other alignment, hut the above two could he constructed fairly cheaply and maintained at reasonable cost. The first might he constructed to-day, but March 1909.would be a very unremunerative line, except in the reach from Baghdad to Nedief. The line via Kut and the Hai would be of no value until the irrigation of the country was undertaken, which would immediately follow the construc tion of the Kut Barrage. Both lines of railways would have to compete heavily t with river transport in an exceedingly flat country (Baghdad is only 115 feet above sea level) where navigation would become very cheap the moment regular freights offered and competition supervened. In this connection it might be useful to note the question of liquid fuel and the development of the oil fields on the Karun river. The present cost of transport by water is no gauge of what may be expected under altered conditions ; for boats which lie idle for months at a time and then have sudden demands made on them exist on extra ordinarily high rates. With the best information at my disposal I estimate as follows : By river from Baghdad to Kut is 320 miles, from Kut to Basrah via Amarah along the present course of the Tigris is 255 miles, or 505 miles in all. Taking the river route along the Hai from Baghdad to Kut is 220 miles, from Kut to Basrah along the Hai and the new channel which the Euphrates is cutting out for itself is 225 miles or 445 miles in all. A line of railway from Baghdad to Kut along the right bank of the Tigris would be 110 miles; Kut to Nasria 110 miles, Nasria (Ur) to Basrah via Zobeir 90 miles, or 310 miles in all. As the railway must of necessity run parallel to and near a navigable river in this flat delta of the Euphrates, where the fall from Baghdad to Basrah in 500 miles is only 110 feet, the competition would be exceedingly severe. The Tigris between Kut and Basrah as it exists to-day, is a very poor river for navigation. Leaving Kut with a width of about 1,000 feet and depth of 25 feet, before reaching Amarah it loses five-sixths of its water in flood times, owing to overflows and deep offcasts, of which the Batera on the right and Chala on the left are the principal: below Amarah the width is about 500 feet, but the river is comparatively shallow. Between Amarah and Kila Saleh it loses nearly the whole of its water through numerous branches and overflows, of which the principal are the Major Kebir on the right and the Atalanta on the left, while its channel dwindles down to a width of about 200 feet and its depth in flood to 10 feet and about 6 feet at low water. Down stream of Kilah Saleh, fed by numerous intakes from the marshes, it gradually increases to a width of 500 feet with a depth of 15 feet. To build works at the heads of the branches or offtakes of the river, which between them takes about 175,000 cubic feet a second (or very nearly the whole discharge of the river at Baghdad) would cost at least £250,000 and there would always be the danger that, no sooner had one branch ^ been con trolled, the river might cut a channel for itself at some neighbouring place. Eor it must be remembered that in the neighbourhood of Amara the Tigris is only some 800 years old, and is practically a deltaic embankment through continuous marshes with its water surface some six feet above that of the mar shes on either side : while there is the ever present danger of the river leaving its channel altogether and flowing hodily into the marshes. The true channel for navigation lies down the Hai branch, wTiich was the main Tigris for thousands of years, and which could again be made the main channel by the construction of the Kut Barrage, which would ensure sufficient water both for navigation and for the irrigation of some 2,000,000 acres of the rich highly ing lands of Lower Mesopotamia. Eor the development of the country on natural lines, and the execution of works which would be profitable alike to the Concessionaire and the country (for there can be no really true difference between them in honest undertakings) the true solution lies in the construction of a railway from Alexandretta on the Mediterranean, via Aleppo to Baghdad, with the establishment of river trans port between Baghdad and Basrah along the Hai branch. The Kut Barrage project which I have proposed will cost £600,000, and the dredging and encouraging of the Euphrates to establish its channel willWon ■^ieet ; s u ilie augeof ille fo[ ieriTji probably cost £200,000 or ££00,000 in all. As payment for tbe execution of such works the Concessionaire might he given all the abandoned and swamped lands between Ur, Zoheir, Basrah and Pao, which could be converted at a reasonable cost into a veritable garden : these lands were known in early Moslem times as one of the tour terrestrial Paradises. The railway from Baghdad to the Mediterranean, following the shortest route to Europe which is the natural market for the products of Mesopotamia and also the source from which its outside wants are supplied, would, I think, he of itself a profitable undertaking. But to make the project complete I think a concession should he asked for a railway from Alexandretta to Baghdad via Aleppo, a steamer service on the Euphrates and Tigris, the construction of the Kut Barrage, with half the double tithe which the State would take from land irrigated by free“flow on the Hai canal, and all the Government waste lands between Ur, Basrah, Zobeir and Eao. The development of these lands will be hurried up by a cut from the Euphrates to the Khor Abdulla, where the mean sea level is two feet lower than it is at Basrah, and by^which a navigable con nexion will probably be soon established with the Persian Gulf through the Khor (see the three fathom line on the map).

Our attitude is still unchanged, only, participation in the present Bagdad railway having for various reaso become impossible, we propose to build our end of the railway ourselves, making our own terms with the Turkish Govera- -ment. The only difference is that our railway will follow the Tigris instead of the Euphrates valley, so as not to clash with the German concession. If the Germans were to accuse us o endeavouring to filch away a part that the Tigris By. would be ready to work in harmony with their railway north of Bagdad, just as the Euphrates railway would have cooperated with them if we had been able to participate in be perfectly consistent with the prev- We have in the past declared our readi- of their concession, our reply would be the present Bagdad By.

Persia, will never be made, or, if made, will be so worked as to place Br. and Indian trade at a great disadvantage in com- -parison with goods from Germany and other countries.” So long as the German concession is not infringed, the German Govt, have no right to feel resentment at the propos- -ed Tigris Railway. The Smyma-Aidin and the Aiersina Railways, both originally British, have had their hinterland cut away from behind them, and the Euphrates a Railway was originally a British propos- -al. A select Committee reported on the subject with recommendations in I87£. The trade o^ Mesopotamia is now almost entirely British, The Germans now avowedly intend, by means of their railway, to transfer it to German hands. The Germans are the invaders, and H.M.G. are on the defensive. The proposed Tigris Railway is a weapon of defence. There is little doubt that if the Bagdad Ey. is built as proposed, with a branch from Sadijeh to Khanikin, that branch will be worked with a view to drawing trade to the north, towards the3a p Mp rU4rei n i ar. , 't!Ti : T0 rr IbrXL noJl z -rJr^ t rUj ^ *1 the Mediterranean, i.e. to the direct detriment of Br. trade, which is chief IT -ly with India. This is emphasised by the fact that the branch is to start from Sadijeh, and not from Bagdad. he construction of the Sadijeh- Khanikin branch would not therefore be entirely in British interest, which would best be served by some such branch as that proposed by Mr. Lloyd and others, from a point on the Tigris south of Bagdad, say Kut el Amara, to Khanikin. This brand* also would not be inconsistent with the Bagdad By. Concession. 'The G-erman Govt, will also be a position to create difficul- .es i respect of the status Koweit. They are almost bound to raise the question of the status of Koweit if they ever build their railway as far as Basrah. But the fact of British capital building the Tigris By. will not strengthen their hands for doing so. On the contrary, it will lessen their power to make difficulties. because if we come to terms with the Turks over the Tigris By. Concession, the status of Koweit will most likely have to be regularised as a part of 9 the understanding. u/v -fa..

This should not be unwelcome. The present situation has never been satisfactory. A settlement of-; the question of the status of Koweit would almost,inevitably have to form a part of any arrangement for a Tigris EatIway Concession. Vi ’’The Tigris alignment will not serve the pilgrim traffic to Kerbela nor the lands to be irrigated by Sir W. Wilcocks' Euphrates scheme. It would only participate in the pilgrim traffic if it got working well in advance of the German Railway. If the alignment o~ r the Ry. were to follow the right bank of the river it would probably get a very fair share of the pilgrim traffic at first, at any rate. Presumably it would not serve the Euphrates irrigated districts, if the German railway were to be constructed eventually; but there is a consensus of opinion that the region it traverses is rich and capable of immense development. The country seems to be traversed by many old irrigation works. But the main point of the Tigris alignmentalignment is that it will keep in British hands the trade with Persia, A, and prevent it from falling to other countries, as it infallibly must if the Bagdad Railway is built 'Even though we anticipate the reman Euphrates line by ours tlong the Tigris, they may find it remunerative to make the Euphrates .ine with an extension from Bagdad ,o Khanikin, and from Basrah via nrbela to the coast'. But we shall be first in the field, an enormous economic advantage. 'The fact that the Turks have iven us the Tigris Ry.

We are encouraged in this hope by the advent of a new regime. If the hope is justified, the Turks would not make thi concession to the Bagdad Ry. Company. Having granted the Tigris Concession without any Turkish money guarantee, they would be unwilling to squander national resources and pledge further revenues for further kilometric guaran-JiSSI I guarantees. Bagdad v/ould have its railv7ay to the sea, and to keep tin ir revenues clear, it would be to their best interest to prevent the Bagdad Kailway Co. ■from building the Mesopot- -amian section a'B all.

Sir, Your Excellency is aware that the question of railway communication between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf has been recently under consideration by an Inter- Departmental Committee, in conjunction with the pro- -posed increase in the Turkish Customs Duties on imports. A copy of the report of the Committee, whose recommend- -ations I have approved, is enclosed herewith. I have to request you to apply to the Turkish Government for a railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf, via Basrah and the Tigris valley, the concession to be without any financial guarahtee from the Turkish Government, and the concessionaires to have the first option of prolonging the railway along the vallet of the Euphrates to the Mediterranean, should tne development of irrigationirrigation and trada render* such a course desirable. It might be worth considering by Your Excellency whether, in the first instance, it would not be aswwell that the Turkish Government should be sounded by Sir A. Block, or by some other person connected with H. M. Embassy in whom you have confidence, so that the ground may be prepared before H. M. G. are formally committed to the proposal. I ^ave* however, the whole question of procedure to Your Excellency’s discretion. The question of the consent of His Majesty's Gov# to the proposed increase of the Customs duty on imports will be treated in a separate despatch.Minute Paper. Secret Department.

If the new Government of Turkey wishes really to improve the admin istration of the country, it is essential that the finances should be placed in a more satisfactory condition and the engagement of Sir Will am Willcocks, with a considerable staff of Engineers, appears to show that the authorities at Constantinople are alive to the fact that the remedy for the impoverished state of the Treasury is to be found in the irrigation of the fertile plains of Mesopotamia. Already the lack of means of communication acts as a serious deterrent to the development of the country, for when the condition of t\e market is such that the cultivating classes might fairly hope to make a handsome profit, they find either that they cannot get their produce out of the country, or that the steamer Companies take the lion’s share of the profit. In 1908 there were large stocks of grain in the country, prices were high in London, and there was a famine in India. At the same time the tribes on the Lower Tigris were disturbed and the river was not safe for sailing craft, consequently the steamer freights rose until the Turkish steamers were getting 40 shillings a ton for carrying wheat from Baghdad to Basrah, while at the same time Lynch’s steamers were charging 33-4 a ton. Even at these prices the steamer offices were besieged by people for space in the steamers. The result was that the entire advantage of the state of the market was taken by the Steamer Companies. As long as this state of things is possible, it is not likely that cultivation for ex port will largely increase. I find from page 233 of Mr. Lloyds’ report that the average value of the trade of Baghdad with Europe and America for the years 1902 to 1906 was as quoted below Imports .. •• •• •• •• £1,404,794 Exports .. • • • • • • • • .. £602,495 and I find from Consular Trade Reports that the average rate of freight during the same period between the United Kingdom and Baghdad was— It is questionable whether these rates are ever likely to be reduced by any material amount. The British River Steamer Company, I am informed, only declares a dividend of 12% (I must confess that I find this difficult to understand), and a shrewd man of business, who has been many years in Baghdad, tells me that he doubts if the present rates can be profitably reduced, bee., use when harvests are bad, or when all export of grain is prohibited, the steamers practically get no cargo on the downward journey. As regards Sea Steamer Companies, all authorities seem to agree that the Hamburg-American Line has been losing money on its Persian Gulf service, and the British Steamer Companies have been urging (Copy.)

I believe that with cheaper freights and better means of communin.f our trade in Turkey would very largely increase, and it is obvious that cheaper freights will enable our trade to compete in more distant parts of Persia. 1 If a railway to the Mediterranean is desirable in existing cirramst,,,-,,. it will be readily admitted that it is absolutely essential to the success of a'*’ large irrigation projects. Sir William Willcocks has now had sufficient ff 7 to make a detailed study of the country, and I understand from him that nowhSe in the world could more promising projects be proposed. He estimates that !; millions acres can eventually be brought under perennial irrigation and that hv using occasional rises m the river, and what would otherwise be the surnlts water of the high floods,, he will be able to flood ten million acres more needed, and so enormously increase the grazing capacity of the countrv. Thill! a very important point, for the country is eminently suited to the raisinv nf sheep and cattle owing to the large quantities of lime in the soil and water and also and also because the pastoral population is present to take ad van fa J f d grazing facilities afforded.

It will be necessary to discuss various parts of the railway lines separately, but * P er haps^ be convenient if I first notice the earlier correspondence regard' mg he Euphrates Valley Railway, which i» available for reference at Baghdad. a lorS 1 ? rec ord of the proceedings of the Select Committee which sat in 1871 and 18/2 to report on the proposed Euphrates Valley Railway is a voluminous document, largely made up of matter which is of no present interest. From the evidence taken I have extracted such information as is likely to be of present use and attached it to this report as Appendix No. 1. At that time Turkey was very anxious to have a railway from Alexandretta to the Persian Gulf and was willing to give England guarantees, if England would herself guarantee the necessary loan. The conclusions at which the Committee arrived were that a_ line of broad gauge railway could be built from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf for about ten millions, that in pro cess of time there would be sufficient traffic to support it, that the political and commercial advantages of establishing a second route (to India) would at anv time be considerable, and might, under possible circumstances, be exceedinslv great, and that it would be worth the while of the English Government to secure them, considering the moderate pecuniary risk that they would incur. I understand from a pamphlet published by Captain Felix Jones that these recommendations were not acted upon because the condition of the money market was not favourable, and also because French influence became very powerful in Turkey. J 6 - It is not my province to discuss the political advantages of having a second route to India; they are certainly not less apparent than they were in 1872, provided the second route is in British hands. 7. In a country where no statistics are published it is impossible to make an estimate of traffic, and to show the system on which the estimate is based. It is, however, easy to show that the productiveness of the country has largely in creased since 1872. The Trade Report for the year 1888-89 shows that the total tonnage of steamers entering the port of Basrah in 1888 was 104 346 tone; The tonnage in 1906 was 229,127 tons.. In 1903 Lynch had two steamers and the Turks had four small steamers running between Baghdad and Basrah : now Lynch has three steamers, and the Turks have added four large steamers to their fleet: there is also a small stern wheeler running up to Samarra, above Baghdad. The trade appears to have been created by the transport facilities,.and there is no reason whv the same thino' should not occur along the Euphrates. ^ As a matter of fact, cultivation has largely increased along the Euphrates- Captain Powell went from Feluja to Meskene in 1872, and he recorded on a map of the river all existing cultivation. In the spring of 1908, I travelled up and down the Euphrates Valley and took pains to compare existing facts with those recorded on the map. I found a very large increase of cultivation. I attach a note (Appendix 2) of my observations. 8. I venture to suggest that we should atonce turn our attention towards obtaining the construction of a British, or British managed, railway, somewhat as follows :— Alexandretta to Aleppo. Aleppo to Meskene. Down the right bank of the Euphrates to Falluja. From Falluja to Baghdad. Baghdad to Basrah or the Persian Gulf. I am aware that we shall not obtain a concession for such a railway without difficulty, but it is important that the most direct line to India should be in our hands, and also that the line serving irrigation works carried out under British Engineers should not be in the hands of any other nation. I presume that the money for the irrigation works v ill le found in England, and if this is correct, we must ensure, as far as possible, that our enterprise is not taxed by othersI We know that there is abundance of water, a vast expanse of fertile soil, and that the levels are almost ideally convenient: consequently the only undetermined factor in the problem is the cost of getting produce to the European market As the difficulties to be overcome are not the same for all sections, it seems desirable to examine each section separately :— Alexakdretta-Aleppo Section. The first thing on this section is to obtain permission to make any harbour improvements that may be required at Alexandretta. Under their Concession of 1903 the Germans have no rights in the port of Alexandretta. From Alexandretta to Aleppo there was no engineering difficulty that could not easily be overcome in 1872, and engineering and mechanical science has since then made much advance. The chief difficulty lies in the engagements which have already been made between the Turkish Government and the French and German railways which are to join at Aleppo. J Article 12 of the German Conces; ion stipulates that should the Government decide on the construction of branches joining the “line which forms the object of the present convention ” to the sea between Mersina and Tripoli it can give the Concession exclusively to the Germans, provided that due consider ation shall be given to the existing rights of the French railway. I have not been able to obtain a copy of the French Concession, but I under stand that Article 36 of the Concession gives to the French Company a right of preference on equal terms over any branches joining their line to the sea. As far as the German Concession is concerned, it seems clear that the Turkish Government is free to make a railway from Alexandretta to Aleppo should it wish to do so, provided it gives no concession to a third party, otherwise than in accordance with the French Concession. Without having seen the text of the French Concession I can express no opinion as to the rights of the French Company. 9. According to Article 21 (9) of the Cahhr des Charges of the German Concession cereals in full w T agon loads, booked for not less than 900 kilometres are carried at 6 paras per ton per kilometre, while the rate for cereals booked under other conditions is 23 paras per kilometre per ton. The rate for sheep is 4 paras per head per kilometre and that for cattle is 27 paras per head per kilometre. In the case of sheep and cattle 1 have not found any provision for a reduction of rates on long distances. Sesame is charged 35 paras per kilometre per ton, with no provision for reduction in case of long distances The whole classification of merchandise shou d, in my opinion, be examined by a traffic expert with a view to seeing how it could be used to injure a direct railway from Baghdad to Aleppo. 8 To take one instance. If the Germans construct the Alexandretta-Aleppo Railway and the branch from El Bajh to Hit, the distance from Hit to Alexand retta will be, approximately, as shown below, taking the railway as a straight line from point to point, in both cases— 6 Hit to Aleppo .. .. .. .. .. 380 miles, or 608 kilometres.

ACAdnuieita, The best solution of the difficulty, as far as the German Company is concerned would appear to be that the Turkish Government should itself construct the Alexandretta Section, and so prevent others from levying a tax on the nrodnc tiveness of irrigation works in Mesopotamia* ^ If the preferential rights of the French Company extend in theory to a ore ference over a Government Railway, they could scarcely be enforced in practice for the Turkish Government could afford to make the railway on terms as regards rates of freight which no Company could accept, because in the case of the Government what it loses in freights it gains in the value of the produce of its irrigation works* r Aleppo to Baghdad Section. The Select Committee established the fact that this section presented no engineering difficulties, though a bridge would be needed across the Euphrates There are no previous concessions, as far as I know, to interfere with this section. It would probably cross the Euphrates near Falluja so as to run on the south of the navigable canal which will join the Euphrates near Ealluja to the Tigris near Baghdad. This large canal would ensure the line from all danger or difficulty connected with inundations. ^ Baghdad to Basrah Section. The right to make this or to have it made under British management in the future should be obtained. The Germans could have no reasonable objection pro vided one or both of the great rivers were kept between their line and the proposed line. The need for this line is not so urgent as is the need for an outlet on the Mediterranean, and I think it is not possible to form an opinion as to whether 13 F.D.the line should run on the right or left bank of the Tigris until Sir William Will- cocks’ survey is further advanced and more is known about existing marshes and how the irrigation works are likely to alter them. Eventually the line will probably be needed, especially if the canals take so much water as to render navigation more difficult than it is at present during the low season. 10. Of the branches to which the German Company has a preferential right on equal terms, the one which is of most imponance to a future Euphrates Valley Railway is the branch from El Bad] to Hit. This branch might not be valuable, supposing that the German Railway was open from Aleppo to Baghdad, because this railway would tap the rich wheat-growing districts sout h of Mosul as well as the Persian trade : but the El Badj-Hit branch would be valuable if the German line was not open : and the fact that the Tigris near El Badj was in direct railway communication with the sea might tend to deter the German Com pany from prosecuting its plans for further railway development in that region. It is clear that if the Euphrates Valley Railway reaches Hit before the German Railway reaches El Badj, the former Company will be in a position to offer terms which could be accepted by no one else. 11. As the possession by the Germans of the Aleppo-Alexandretta section would injure the westward traffic along a Euphrates Valley Railway, so the pos session of the Sadija-Khanakin Branch would injure all British trade with Persia. It is therefore most important that we should obtain control of this section if possible. The control of the Baghdad-Kerbela-Basrah Section is not so important commercially, if there is an alternate line on the other bank of the Euphrates, but the control of this section is required on political grounds which have many times been discussed. 12. Sir William Willcocks has represented to the Minister for Public Works the necessity which exists for the Turkish Government to retain freedom of action in the matter of the Aleppo-Alexandretta Railway. Sir William has also written a “ private” memorandum containing his views on this railway. I enclose a copy of this document as Appendix No. 3. I believe that Sir William has sent a ccpy of this document to some of his capitalist friends in England with a view tc stimulating their interest in a scheme which he intends to urge on the attention of financiers when he visits England this summer. 13. The arguments which I have tried to develop may be briefly summaris- as follows :— ed (1) The regeneration of Turkey depends upon financial assistance to be obtained from Mesopotamia. (2) The success of irrigation works in Mesopotamia depends upon direct railway communication with the Mediterranean. (3) If the Germans obtain the management of the Aleppo-Alexandretta line they will be able to reap large profits which fairly belong to the irrigation worku (4) If the port of Alexandretta is also in their hands their position will be even more dominant. (5) Neither the German nor the French Concessions make it impossible for the Turkish Government to make a railway from Aleppo to Alexandretta, which can be under British management. (6) There is nothing to prevent a direct Baghdad-Aleppo line. (7) The Germans in possession of the Khanakin-Sadija Branch will be able to tax all our trade with Persia. (8) The Germans in possession of the Baghdad-Basrah Section will be able to tax all our trade with India, and our sea borne trade with Europe, unless we have an alternative line on the left bank of the Euphrates. (9) Until improvements are made steamer freights are not likely material ly to decrease. (10) The irrigation of Mesopotamia will be a protection for India against famine.

It seems that Mr. McNeill had never seen the site of the lower bridge. The estimates were said to be both careful and generous. A landing stage at Alexandretta would cost £ 50,000. (Q. 831.) Sir John McNeill said he would make a three-foot gauge line from Alexandretta to the Gulf for 6|- millions, including rol ing-stock and interest on capital during construction. (Page 59.)

Between Ana and Meskene I saw enormous numbers of sheep, and there must have been many more that I did not see. J. RAMSAY, Lieutenent-Colonel, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad,5 'crvaii ^ I % APPENDIX No. III. Babylonia. I have been very carefully examining the country between Samarra and Babylon (Hilla) past Baghdad and Ctesiphon and have had a special opportunity owing to the fact that I am spending £30,000 on the repairs of the Hindiya Barrage, and the first thing that strikes one is the fact that all possibility of the real development of this country depends as much on a railway direct from Baghdad to the nearest port on the Mediterranean as on irrigation. The best route is Baghdad, Hit, Ana, Der, Aleppo, Alexandretta : and the next best is Baghdad, Hit, Ana, Der, Palmyra, Damascus, Beyrout. These are the two real trade routes of this country. Both are under 600 miles. Nearly everything we produce goes to Europe and very much of it to the Eastern Mediterranean countries, and what we chiefly want are European goods and cheap coal. This is a country strangely devoid of fuel and we pay for coal in Baghdad £3-15-0 per ton by the time it has gone through the Suez Canal to Basrah and come up the 520 miles of the Tigris. Now if we had a railway from the Mediterranean we should have coal here as cheap at any rate as at Assuan which is considerably more than 600 miles from Alexandria. The railway, moreover, which ran from Beyrout or Alexandretta here would have cheap coal bought on the Mediterranean and not dear stuff bought in Basrah and Baghdad. The Euphrates valley is very rich and can be irrigated and is irrigated very cheaply by water-power the whole way, and the current is strong enough to turn wheels and lift water. It is too strong for navigation. We here are a great grain-producing country with unlimited capabilities for extension and the whole goes to the Eastern Mediterranean or Europe. What, however, has struck me more than anything, and I am forming my projects accordingly, is the fact that this country is even more a sheep and cattle and horse breeding country than a granary. We can irrigate with the supply of the river 6,000,000 acres, but we can irrigate in addition as pastures 10,000,000 acres on which millions of sheep and cattle could feed. All these would go west. In a year of drought like this sheep are worth a song because they cannot be got out of the country (and droughts are common here). If we had a railway to the Mediterranean direct, the transport for sheep and cattle alone would occupy a line the whole winter, and then would come the har vest of wheat, barley and winter cereals, and then the summer harvest of rice and Indian-corn all going west. Turnips for sheep-feeding are grown over large areas and could be grown over tens of thou sands by irrigation, the day we have weirs. The turnips are very fine indeed, the best I have seen, and, as they are a winter crop here, swedes and mangoes would do well. The 12 per cent, lime in the soil and water are excellent for all animals, and the animals of this country are in consequence very fine. All this needs an outlet on the Mediterranean. A railway from Baghdad to the Mediterranean would fill the country with visitors who would see for themselves, bring money into the country and open it. If the Nile opened into that hole and corner place the Persian Gulf, and not into the Mediterranean, and there was no railway connecting it with the Mediterranean, the value of the produce and the land of Egypt would fall over 100% if not 200%. The more I think, study, consult local merchants, and understand the country, the more I am convinced that in a Euphrates Valley Railway lies the development of the country. The Euphrates Valley can produce and does produce every kind of fruit to perfection, and the valley, compared with what it was 50 year agos, is already another world. To transport wheat from Baghdad to Basrah costs £1-8-0 per ton and from Basrah to 'London (including transhipping) £1-2-0 or £2-10 0 per ton. Put that on Argentine or Cana dian wheat and you would strangle the trade. Mesopotamia could produce some 4,000,000 tons of wheat, and barley for export, and, with out exaggerating, many millions of sheep ; all for the west. English trade would benefit im mensely, for English goods would come direct here instead of going round by Aden and Kara chi and Basrah, while the trains would take back all the things England needs. I say nothing of oil seeds, excellent beetroot for sugar and cotton, which we can produce They would be an additional asset. And all that is needed is under 600 miles of railway, the whole length of which very nearly is capable of being cultivated and in ancient days was culti vated and thickly populated. The population to-day is increasing by leaps and bounds in spite of every discouragement to transport. Baghdad ; 14$ February 1909[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] Sir, Foreign Office, July 24, 1909. WE were directed by you— “ To reconsider the answer to be given to the Turkish Government to their request for an increase of the customs dues from 1L per cent, to 15 per cent, iu the light of further information received from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bagdad in connection with a proposed concession for a railway from the Mediterranean to Bagdad and Bussorah.” In addition to the draft despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and his despatch of the 25th May, 1909, covering the despatch of the 10th March. 1909, from Mr. Consul-General Ramsay, in which the proposal for a Euphrates valley railway is put forward, we have had the advantage of seeing two unofficial letters addressed to Sir C. Hardinge, the first from Sir G. Lowther, containing some observations on the draft despatch, and the second from Sir Adam Block. In the draft despatch to Sir G. Lowther it was proposed (a) to insist upon the point that, whilst His Majesty’s Government have every desire to see an improvement in Turkish administration, and realise that this can be attained only if increased revenues are procured, the proposed increase in the customs duties would be borne in greater part by British trade ; and (b) to inform the Turkish Government that His Majesty’s Government would therefore agree to the proposed increase only on condition either of participation in the Bagdad-Bussorah section of the Bagdad Railway, or alternatively of a concession for a separate line between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad via Bussorah and the Tigris valley, with the option of prolonging it along the Euphrates valley to Tripoli or some other port upon the Mediterranean, the construction of such a line to be carried out without any kilometric guarantee from the Turkish Government. In view of the despatch already mentioned from Sir G. Lowther, and the despatch from Mr. Consul-General Ramsay which it covered, it has been suggested that the order of the alternative condition to be imposed by His Majesty’s Govermnent should be inverted ; that is to say, that the condition should be a concession for a line from Alexandretta to Bagdad, with either participation in the present German concession from Bagdad to Bussorah or the continuation of the line by an independent route to the Persian Gulf. The financial and commercial prospects of the three alternative railway proposals,* and their relative importance to British and Indian trade, are examined in a memorandum prepared by the representatives of the Board of Trade upon the Committee and appended to this report; and we are in entire agreement with the conclusions reached in that memorandum. In our opinion, a railway from Alexandretta to Bagdad by way of the Euphrates valley, though of some use to British (but not to Indian; trade, must for a considerable number of years be of value chiefly for political and strategical purposes, the advantages of which will accrue mainly to the Turkish Government, although the construction and management of the line may to some extent serve to maintain the prestige of the British Government in the Turkish Empire. We have grave doubt whether such a railway would be financially remunerative for many years to come ; and if it were continued to the sea, either by the route of the German concession or by an alternative route, the section between Alexandretta and Bagdad would, we think, be likely to be for a long time a drag upon the prosperity of the undertaking. [779] * See Appendix, p. 4. BLx / On the other hand, all the available evidence goes to show that a line from Bnssorah to Bagdad would in all probability speedily become financially remunerative, and would certainly be at once of great use to the trade of both the United Kingdom and India. The success of two competing lines between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad is more problematical, and we believe that, should the present German concession be maintained, a British line might be gravely handicapped—first, by the fact that it would have to pass through districts m which less traffic would be available , and, secondly, by the absence of any independent continuations northwards of Bagdad, and into Persia. Nevertheless it seems probable that a concession, even if a competitive one, from Bussorah to Bagdad would be of more value than a concession from Alexandretta to Bagdad—the latter, it must also be remembered, might be handicapped by the claims of the German concessionnaires in virtue of their reversionary rights, under article 12 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903, in regard to the con struction of a branch line to the Mediterranean between Mersina and Tripoli We are therefore of opinion that, from every point of view (1) a concession for a railway between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad via Bussorah would be more desirable, and, so far as relates to the enlistment of capital, more practicable than a concession for a line starting from Aleppo or Alexandretta ; and (2) so far as the Bussorah-Bagdad region is concerned, participation in the existing German concession would be more valuable than a concession for the construction of an independent line. To this extent, then, we are strongly inclined to favour the proposals contained in the original draft despatch to Sir G. Lowther, in preference to the alternative suggested as the result of Mr. Consul-General Ramsay’s scheme. Your Committee observe that both Sir G. Lowther and Sir Adam Block are of opinion that it would be undesirable to connect—at least, formally—any demand for railway facilities with the approval by His Majesty’s Government of the proposed increase of the Turkish customs duties. It is not within our province to consider what other conditions, if any, might be imposed ; but we are disposed to think that it would, on the whole, be inadvisable for His Majesty’s Government to make their consent to the increase of the customs duties conditional upon the grant of any railway concession unless they are prepared to insist upon that condition being fulfilled. After careful consideration, we recommend that the Turkish Government should be approached for— (i.) A concession for a railway between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad via Bussorah and the Tigris valley, in competition, should that he found necessary, with the present German concession ; the British concession to be without anv financial guarantee from the Turkish Government, and the concessionnaires to have the first option of prolonging the railway subsequently along the Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, should the development of irrigation and trade render such a course desirable. (ii.) An undertaking that, in the event of a group of British financiers, formed with Government approval, being able to come to terms with the present German concessionaires for participation in the existing concession by the construction and control of the Bussorah-Bagdad section, the Turkish Government would abrogate in their favour article 29 of the concession, which prohibits any construction or working of the section southward of Bagdad until the railway has reached that city from the north. The Turkish Government should be requested to undertake, at the same time, not to abrogate article 29 under any circumstances other than those specified above. We recoimnend that these proposals should be put before the Turkish Government as soon as possible, and before any reply is given as to the desired increase of customs duties ; but that the two matters should be kept distinct, a favourable reply from the Turkish Government in regard to the railway proposals not being made pre-requisite to the sanction by His Majesty’s Government of the increase of duties. We understand that His Majesty’s Government would be willing to guarantee a reasonable rate of interest on the capital invested by any British syndicate which might be formed ; and, as we have already indicated, we do not think that the guarantee would long be necessary. We have reason to believe that, under these circumstances, no serious difficulty would be encountered in the formation of a British syndicate. We believe that the prospect of a rapid completion of the railway, with the additional prosperity which would follow, would be a strong inducement to the Turkish Government to accede to the British requests. On the other hand, the possibility of a competitive line southward of Bagdad, together with the knowledge that, should an arrangement be made with an English financial group, article 29 would be abrogated, and the completion of the whole railway and its full earning power mention 1 fc|lnsaW f W?thereby expedited, would, we think, render the German concessionnaires willing to listen to proposals for British participation. It may perhaps be desirable that, before any negotiations on the subject are undertaken, consideration should be given to the financial clauses of the present con vention with a view to ascertaining whether, and if so to what extent, it may be *^^lvisable to offer to the Turkish Government or to the German concessionnaires, or to both, a participation in the proceeds of the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section.

MEMORANDUM ON RAILWAY PROPOSALS IN REGARD TO MESOPOTAMIA. THE following memorandum is concerned solely with the commercial possibilities of the three alternative railway proposals which have been placed before the committee. These are:— (i.) An attempt to participate in the existing Bagdad Railway Concession, by an arrangement with the present concessionnaires to undertake the construction of the section from Bussorah by the right bank of the Euphrates to Bagdad (via Kerbela) and, if possible, northward still to Mosul; with these would go also, if obtainable, a line from Bagdad via Khanikin to Kermanshah. (ii.) The construction of a railway from Bussorah to Bagdad, either to the east of the Tigris or between the Tigris and the Euphrates, with a branch to Kerbela : this is to be in competition with the Bagdad Railway as already planned. (iii.) The construction of a railway from Alexandretta to Aleppo, thence to Meskene, and thence by the valley of the Euphrates, on the right bank, to Hit, and then across the river eastward to Bagdad, with the possibility of continuing the line to the Gulf. As regards the section Alexandretta-Aleppo, it is to be remembered that should the Turkish Government itself not build such a line a French company has the first right to a concession, and, should they not desire to exercise it, the right appears to revert to the German company. The length of the railway from Alexandretta to Aleppo would be about 92 miles; from Aleppo to Hit about 380 miles ; and from Hit to Bagdad about 100 miles—or say 600 miles in all. The railway distance from Bagdad to Bussorah (as contemplated by the German concession) is 350 miles ; the distance would be about the same by a railway on the east of the Tigris ; by a route across the plains between the rivers the distance woidd be about 280 to 300 miles. In the almost total absence of any satisfactory statistical data, the considerations to be taken into account must necessarily be of a very general character ; and in the first place it may be convenient to take the first tv r o schemes, which may be called the “ Gulf ” schemes, together, and compare them with the third, or “Mediterranean” scheme. In both cases what is desired is to increase British hold upon the trade of Mesopotamia, in view both of its present importance and of the probable expansion as the result of irrigation. At present the main route of trade into and from Mesopotamia is by the Persian Gidf and the Tigris River ; there is a large transit trade with Persia via Khanikin; some small amount of goods comes in from the north, via Erzeroum, Kharput, and Diarbekir, and there is a considerable traffic between Syria and Mesopotamia, via Aleppo, Maskene, and the valley of the Euphrates, to Bagdad (by caravans and boats), or via Beirout, Damascus, Karyatain, Mayadim, and the Euphrates valley (by caravans and boats also). No statistics are available of the amount and value of the trade which passes by these last three routes, but it appears to be quite small, relatively, to the traffic into and from Mesopotamia by the Gulf and Persian routes. The Gulf railway schemes are based upon existing and well-ascertained conditions, and the speculative elements are very slight. Either of the lines from Bussorah to Bagdad woxdd pass through a tract of country which by reason of the alluvial deposit is already very fertile, producing wheat, barley, and other cereals, rice, dates, and liquorice in great quantities, and with possibilities for silk and cotton ; there is a con siderable amount of sheep and cattle-rearing ; there are large and important towns and a population growing with some rapidity ; one part of the region (that around Kerhela) is a very important pilgrim resort—80,000 to 100,000 pilgrims, mainly from Persia, are estimated to visit Kerbela annually; a steady stream of trade, both for MesopotamiaWtfStHKR — t 5 and Persia, already passes tlirough the country, and it seems to be well established that the present traffic facilities are totally inadequate ; and finally, there is a fully-developed trade organisation ready to take full and immediate advantage of the economic expansion which is likely to follow upon the execution of the irrigation schemes, the improvement of agricultural methods, and administrative reforms. The value of the imports into Bagdad from Europe amounted in 1907 to 1,784,9811, and from India, China, and the Persian Gulf to 527,399/.; the value of the exports to Europe and America amounted to 557,085/., and to India and China to 153,203/. In addition to this there were large shipments of grain by native craft, of which no details are available. So far as construction is concerned, neither of the Gulf schemes presents any engineering difficulties, and accordingly, in view of the economic conditions and possibilities of the Bussorah-Bagdad region, there seems no reason to doubt that a railway there would speedily become remunerative, if it were not so from the first. Whether tw’o competing railways would be likely to be financially successful, and if not, which of the two alternative schemes it would be desirable to adopt, are questions which will be considered later. lurning now to the proposed Mediterranean route, it must be pointed out that the proposal is far from being a new one, that no new facts have so far been advanced in its support, and that it rests largely upon anticipations as to future possibilities, instead of upon present conditions. (a.) Almost from the very commencement of railway enterprise the possibility of the construction of a railway from Alexandretta along the Euphrates valley was con templated, mainly as an overland route to India. Various surveys were made, and finally, as Major Ramsay has pointed out, the matter wuis considered very fully in 1871, after the opening of the Suez Canal, by a Committee of the House of Commons, which took voluminous evidence, and received also, through the Foreign Office, a number of reports from consular officers and others acquainted with the country. The Committee considered an alternative proposal for a line to follow a route closely resembling that of the present Bagdad Railway concession. Though they reported in favour of the Euphrates Valley line, it is not apparent that, as Major Ramsay appears to suppose, they had any great confidence in the commercial possibilities of the scheme; they favoured it because it would be considerably the shorter and cheaper to construct, and afford quicker passage for persons, troops, or mails, but they expressly stated that the Tigris route might attract the larger amount of traffic. General Chesney, who had long before surveyed the route, expressed the opinion that heavy goods would continue to go (to India) by the canal, “ leaving the light valuable goods, mails, passengers, troops, and treasure to go by rail.” The decision of the Committee seems to have been determined largely by strategical considerations. In the early discussions of routes for the present Bagdad Railway concession the Germans made a preliminary survey of the Euphrates Valley route, but abandoned the idea of utilising it. (/&gt;.) The evidence given before the Committee of 1871 showed that from Meskene, where the proposed line would strike the Euphrates, to Hit, which is the head of the fertile districts, the course of the river is through a valley of a few miles in width, with a slight alluvial deposit, and fairly generally cultivated ; beyond that there is on both sides arid prairie, which is covered in the spring months with a prolific growth of rank grasses. In 1871 it was stated that the prairie undulates greatly, and at every few miles forms gaps or wide ravines, which are flooded in the rainy season.,. There are scarcely any towns of any degree of importance, and the country as a whole is very sparsely populated. There is a considerable amount of sheep-rearing under difficulties. Between Aleppo and the Euphrates there is a gently undulating plain, mostly devoid of trees and with swampy valleys. Major Ramsay quotes, in Appendix No. 1 to his despatch, some opinions as to the prospects of the railway, only one of which (that of Sir Henry Rawlinson) is antagonistic. He does not, however, refer to the Consular opinions collected by the Foreign Office, and a reference to these shows that there was a much stronger body of hostile opinion (represented by Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert, Consul-General at Bagdad, Mr. Consul Holmes, Mr. Vice-Consul Rassam at Mosul, Mr. W. G. Palgrave, Mr. Consul-General Wood, and Mr. Consul Taylor) than would appear from the list of opinions cited by Major Ramsay. There was, in fact, a very marked divergence of opinion. It should be stated, however, that some of the advocates of the line, ^ including members of Sir George Chesney’s mission, based their case upon the possibility of reclaiming land,, developing agriculture, and creating a population, and also upon the establishment and maintenance of order. [779] CMajor Ramsays notes, in Appendix No. 2 to his despatch, do not add much to the information contained in the Report and evidence of the Committee of 1871, and apparently his observations relate almost solely to the country immediately on the banks of the river. The report by Sir William Willcocks is lacking in exact details, and it is not always clear to what part of the Euphrates valley he refers ; nor is there any evidence in his memorandum that lie has himself visited the country between _ Meskene and Hit. (c.) The proposal, so far as the line from Aleppo to Hit is concerned, is then based on assumptions as to the probable economic developments which would be likely to follow upon the organisation of irrigation works, the growth of population, promotion of systematic agriculture, and the development of transport facilities. All the factors for the speedy success of a railway which are present in the district Bussorah-Bagdad are absent from the region of the middle Euphrates, and it must inevitably take a very considerable time to call them into being. The line presents no engineering difficulties of any kind, and the estimate made in 1871, of 6,500L per mile from Aleppo to the Euphrates, and of 8,000Z. a mile along the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf, is scarcely likely to be exceeded at the present day. This would make the total cost of construction from i Aleppo to Bagdad about 4,060,000Z. A recent advocate of this line (Mr. George Lloyd) remarks that “ it is not suggested that it would be likely to do more than pay expenses, | if as much, for several years after it was built.” The German Bagdad line, tapping the Diarbekir-Mosul region, has, from the point of view of immediate commercial success in regard to local traffic, a very great advantage. Much of the earning capacity of the line would depend on the extent to which goods which at present go to or from Europe via the Persian Gulf would be diverted to the new route. This again is a problem for the solution of which there are no adequate data. But it may be pointed out— The conclusion to be derived from the considerations which have now been set out appears to be that the construction of the Euphrates line from the Mediterranean to Bagdad would by itself be an enterprise from which little, if any, financial profit or any substantial benefit to British trade would be likely to be derived for a considerable period, whereas the Bussorah-Bagdad line maybe expected to be profitable from the outset and advantageous to the trade alike of the United Kingdom and India. The foregoing remarks have been directed to the consideration of the relative merits of the railways to Bagdad from Aleppo and Bussorah respectively, and to the support of the contention that if a choice has to be made between the two, the advantage of the Bussorah route is very pronounced. There is, however, the possibility of a through line from Aleppo via Bagdad to Bussorah, much shorter' than the line to be built under the present German concession. But it may be pointed out that in such a (1.) That, so far as India’s trade is concerned, she has nothing to gain by the construction of a railway from the Mediterranean to Bagdad. The values of her imports into and exports from Bagdad have already been stated; with the economic development of Mesopotamia a considerable expansion of her trade there may confidently be anticipated ; there is the important Persian trade; and it must also be remembered that, with the increase of grain production in Mesopotamia, she may be able, in times of famine, to draw from that country greatly enlarged supplies. The construction of railways in the Bussorah-Bagdad region is therefore likely to be of immediate and practical interest to Indian trade ; but, on the other hand, it is not apparent that any direct benefit would result to her trade from the Euphrates route from Bagdad to the Mediterranean, since it is at best very doubtfal if railway carriage for goods can ever compete successfully with water carriage to India; (2.) That, whilst the existing trade routes on the whole markedly favour British and Indian trade with Mesopotamia, the construction of the new route would help foreign competitors quite as much, if not more, than British traders ; (3.) That any diversion of traffic might have a disadvantageous effect upon the finances of the Suez Canal; (4.) That so long as the Alexandretta-Aleppo section, the lines northw r ard from Bagdad and from Bagdad into Persia, and the line from Bagdad to the Gulf were not in British hands, it would be possible for the companies working those lines to cripple, if not by differential rates then by methods of working, the utility of the Euphrates line to British traders.v line the commercial advantages of the Bagdad-Bussorah section might be counter balanced by the unprofitableness of the Bagdad-Aleppo section, and if the former section were competitive with the German line through the same region, its earning power would undoubtedly be much reduced. At an average cost of 8,000/. a-mile, the total cost of construction of such a line would be from about 7,500,000/. to about &gt; 8,000,000/. Considerable as the trade of Southern Mesopotamia is at present, and large as are the possibilities of the future, it scarcely appears probable that there is room for two competing lines. The line to the east of the Tigris would be less competitive than that between the two rivers, but would have little, if any, advantage over the German route in point of length. The route secured for the German line to the west of the Euphrates has the very substantial advantage that it will draw r to itself the large pilgrim traffic from Persia to Kerbela and the considerable trade which is growing up at that town ; by either of the proposed British routes the railway would touch no considerable town, and would be largely dependent on through traffic. Moreover, there would clearly be difficulties in relation to traffic northwards of Bagdad. It is only in the country there through which the German line is to pass that there is, or is likely to be for a number of years, any large market, and it is fairly certain that goods destined for any points beyond Bagdad would be sent wherever possible right through from Bussorah on one and the same—that is, the German—line. Similarly all goods coming for export from north of Bagdad would preferably go through to Bussorah without transference from one line to another at Bagdad. And it is not clear that the British lines such as are proposed would be able effectively to compete by reduction of rates wdth a line which passes through a better part of Southern Mesopotamia, and also forms part of a larger system, drawing on a larger and more profitable area. The cost of construction of a line from Bagdad to Bussorah has been estimated at about 8,000/. a-mile, which would mean a total of about 3,000,000/. if the route followed were the proposed German route to the west of the Euphrates, or the proposed British route east of the Tigris. At the same rate a line over the plains between the rivers w T ould cost about 2,250,000/. to 2,500,000/. to construct.'' 1 '' It may be observed that the difference in cost between the German concession line and the shorter competing line is probably not much more than 500,000/., and that the earning capacity of either of the two competing lines, and particularly of the English line, would be very much less than, that of the German line by itself. On the whole, then, if it be decided, as appears advisable, to concentrate attention on the Bussorah-Bagdad region, it would be desirable that an attempt should be made to obtain participation in the German scheme; and if, failing that, efforts be made • to obtain a concession for an alternative route, it should be on the distinct under standing that such a concession is sought because it is deemed necessary that British trade should possess an independent route into the heart of Mesopotamia, whether it be immediately remunerative or not.

THE Grand Vizier yesterday in conversation touched on the subject of the Bagdad Railway, and declared that neither he nor any other Grand Vizier, of no matter what party, could ever allow the Bagdad Railway to he terminated on the lines of the present convention. It wns, in his opinion, essential that Great Britain should participate in the work. He was awure that when the suggestion had previously been made the Germans had demanded the control, but this should be got over. He did not desire to go at length into the subject with me, as, before his departure, he had fully exposed his views to Tewfik Pasha, and had instructed his Highness to take an early opportunity of laying them before you.

THE French Ambassador called on the 19th instant and was received by Sir Charles Hardinge. He had been instructed to state that M. Auboyneau had on the previous day informed M. Pichon that in 1903 an agreement had been made between the Deutsche Bank and the Ottoman Bank by which the latter institution was to participate to the extent of 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, in the Badgad Railway scheme The Ottoman Bank had now received a warning from the Deutsche Bank that they must declare before the 23rd June, i.6., within four days, whether they intend to take up this participation or not, and that if the reply was in the negative, the Deutsche Bank would proceed without the co-operation of the Ottoman Bank. M. Auboyneau wished to know what he should do. M. Pichon had replied that if the Ottoman Bank went in with the Deutsche Bank in the Bagdad Railway, it was a banking concern, and must be regarded as such ; but that the French Government would not allow the shares to be quoted on the Paris Bourse unless the scheme were one which they could approve and in which there was a British participation. M. Auboyneau told M. Pichon that the Ottoman Bank were in the course of discussing British participation with a financial group in London. The French Ambassador had been instructed to enquire whether this information was true, and what were the views of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the matter. Sir Charles Hardinge replied that the views of His Majesty’s Government were well known to M. Gambon, and that they had not been modified. He added that no information whatever as to any negotiations with a British financial group for participation in the Bagdad Railway had reached this Department, and that he could hardly believe that any serious negotiations could be in progress without the views of His Majesty’s Government having been previously ascertained. M. Gambon remarked that he was afraid that, owing to the recent exodus of capital from England and France to Belgium and Switzerland, the financial situation had been modified to the advantage of Germany, and that unless some agieement were come to before long we might have the unpleasant spectacle of the Bagdad Railway being completed with British and French capital.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a Memorandum compiled by the British Delegate on the Ottoman Debt, in view of the interpellation which was to have been addressed to the Minister of Public Works in the Ottoman Chamber on the subject of the Bagdad Railway Concession. Sir Adam Block presented this Memorandum to the Grand Vizier, who showed considerable alarm at the conclusions arrived at in it, and proceeded at once to consult with the Minister of Finance upon the question. Meanwhile the interpellation, which was to have come up on Saturday, had to be postponed on account of the absence of both the Minister of Public Works and the Minister for Foreign Affairs from the Chamber. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) GERARD LOWTHER. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Bagdad Railway and the Surplus of the Ceded Revenues of the Debt Administration. ARTICLE 7 of the “ Decret-Annexe ” of the 1st (14th) September, 1903, states “ Les excedents des recettes de la Dette Publique Ottomane au-dessus du chiffre de £T. 2,157,375 seront partages entre le Gouvernement Imperial et la Dette Publique Ottomane dans les proportions suivantes:75 pour cent au Gouvernement Imperial, 25 pour cent a la Dette Publique Ottomane. (i La part des 25 pour cent de la Dette Publique Ottomane dans les excedents ci-dessus indiquds sera appliqude a un amortissement extraordinaire des obligations de a Dette Convertie Uniiiee, et des Lots Turcs.” Thus the whole of the surplus practically reverts to the Turkish Government, as the 25 per cent, applied to amortization of the Turkish Debt may also be said to revert to the Government. . ^ i The 75 per cent., however, is paid in cash to the Turkish Government at the end of the year. . The average estimated surplus of the ceded revenues of the Debt Administration may be taken at £ T. 500,000 (taking into account that the Eastern Roumelian annuity is no longer forthcoming), of which 75 per cent., or £ T. 375,000, reverts annually m cash to the Turkish Government. . „ , Of this £ T. 375,000, the sum of £ T. 124,059 is assigned for the service of the 4 per Cent. Loan of 1904, leaving a balance of £ T. 250,941 annually available tor t le Turkish Government. ^ ix aj • - i. Out of this, £ T. 15,000 is at present annually due to the Public Debt Administra tion for the increase of the reserve. _, „ ... There is thus an average estimated annual sum of £T. 235,941 whic lever s o the Turkish Government from their share in the surplus revenue of the e it. There exist to-day floating charges on the Government s share in e surp u&amp; amounting to £T. 1,199,902, of which £T. 200,000 will be paid out of the proceeds of the new loan and £ T. 300,000 only payable after the annuity the Bagdad Loan, second series, and may therefore be deducted, leaving £ T. 699,902. These floating charges will be paid off in about three years and a-half. [2152 h —3]According to the Decree of Muharrem, any increase in the customs revenues is ceded to the Debt Administration for the bondholders. The other ceded revenues bein°' sufficient for the service of the Debt, all new revenues produced hy an increase of the customs will go to increase the surplus, and will therefore (as long as the other revenues suffice for the service of the Debt) be divided between the Government and the Debt, 75 per cent, for the former, and 25 per cent, for the latter for extraordinary sinking fund of the Debt. _ ^ ^ When the 3 per cent., however, was agreed to by the Powers, the Governments share in that part of the surplus of the Debt revenues produced by the increased 3 per cent, was set apart for a specific purpose, namely, to cover the deficit in the Macedonian Budget. . In round figures, the 3 per cent, gives to-day ,£T. 800,000. (It could with a reformed and reorganized Customs Administration give a good deal more.) Seventy-five per cent, of this, namely, £ T. 600,000, is paid to the Macedonian Commission, and 25 per cent, is applied to the extraordinary sinking fund of the Debt. The position is thus as follows :— Surplus of ceded revenues, say £ T. 500,000, of which 75 per cent, is paid to Government, namely, £ T. 3/5,000, less £ F. 12 , I,059 annuity of Doan of 1904, and less £ T. 15,000 for Debt reserve fund, leaving £T. 235,941 to Government per annum. Surplus produced by 3 per cent., £ T. 800,000, of which Government’s share of 75 per cent., namely, £T. 600,000, is applied to Macedonia. All further increase of customs dues has to be paid to Debt Administration under the Decree of Muharrem, and 75 per cent, reverts to Government. Supposing that the duties are increased by 4 per cent., bringing the total duty to 15 per cent., this would produce, say, £ T. 1,070,000, and, if the Customs Administra tion is reorganized, perhaps 20 per cent, more, namely, in all, £ T. 1,284,000, of which 75 per cent, again reverts to the Government in cash. This sum of £ T. 963,000 would be available for services of a new loan w^ere it not that the Turkish Government has signed a Convention with the Bagdad Bailway Company, which I shall now proceed to explain. I inclose for reference “ Extrait du Proc&amp;s-verbal No. 63 ” of the Debt Council, containing the deliberations of the Council, the “ Convention Additionnelle ” of the Bagdad Bail way of the 2nd June, 1908, and the contract of the loan of the Bagdad Bailway, series 2 and 3, of the same date. Article 9 of the contract stipulates that the Government shall assign, “ d’une maniere exclusive et irrevocable,” the sums of £ T. 200,000 for the second series and £ T. 220,000 for the third series, to be taken from the surplus of the ceded revenues (the product of the 3 per cent, being excepted). (In case of insufficiency other revenues are assigned.) Thus already the Government is engaged to pay £ T. 420,000 per annum. I have shown that the Government’s share in the average annual surplus is to-day only £ T. 235,941, and as there are floating charges yet to he paid ofi it is only in 1913 that this will be available. The Government cannot therefore to-day pay the annuities of £ T. 200,000 and £ T. 220,000 out of the surplus ; and if the Germans construct the four sections, as specified in the contract of the 2nd June, the Government will have to find the money from the Aghnam of the Vilayets of Konia, Adana, and Aleppo, since the other supplementary guarantees specified in Article 9 are not available, and will not be available for years to come, if ever. (The interest of series 2 is running and the drawings are taking place. The Bail way Company is paying the interest.) But as soon as the surplus is available it must, under the contract, go to the service of the construction loans of the four sections. If, then, in the meantime, the customs duties are increased, the product of the increased duties, which becomes surplus of the Debt revenues—or, rather, the 75 per cent, which belongs to Govern ment of the increased surplus—must be applied to the service of the construction loans of the four sections, unless the increased duties are excepted by a new arrange ment and at the moment when agreed to by the Powders it is expressly stated that the Government’s share in the product of the increased duties shall be applied to a specific object, as was the case wdth the 3 per cent. But this is not all. In the “ Convention Additionnelle,” paragraph 2, it is stated explicitly that “ 1’excedent des revenus concedes a la Dette Publique ayant ete alfecte au prolongement de la ligne de Bagdad,” &amp;c. This general statement does not applyto the four sections but to the whole line, and will therefore apply to the remaining five sections from lielit onwards. » This general condition which is confirmed by the letter of the Ministry of fTioo aaa’ 6 De i Vui 1 f° f ^ tl ’ a A t du rroc^s-yerbal ”) means that even when the &amp; T. 420,000 is available from the Government’s share in the surplus of the Debt revenues all further surpluses will be applied to the remaining five sections-or, m other words a further sum of, say, £T. 550,000 will have to come out of the G-overnment s share m the surplus. To-day £ T. 420,000 are required annually and there is only £ T. 235,941 available, and that only after payment of floating charges on the surplus—namely, it will be available in 1913 only. ^ After that the Government s share in the surplus, as it increases, will go to provide the balance of the £ T. 420,000, namely, £ T. 184,059, and then for the £ T. 550,000 for the remaining five sections—a total of £ T. 734,059. Supposing the increased customs duties give, as above shown, £ T. 1,284,000 • of the Government’s share of £T. 963,000, the sum of firstly £ T. 184,059 for the four sections, and secondly £ T. 550,000 for the remaining five sections, or in all £ 1. 734,059, will have to be deducted for the railway construction loans, leaving only £ T. 228,941 for the Government from the increased duties, to be applied to a new loan, or to cover ordinary current expenditure, unless some arrangement is come to with the Bagdad Railway Company. There is still another point in the “ Convention Additionnelle ” which again affects the surplus revenues to the prejudice of the Government, and prevents the latter from the free usufruct of any increase in the new duties. Paragraph 3 states: “Quant aux frais d’exploitation, ils seront garantis en premier lieu par les recettes brutes de ces 840 kilom., etant entendu que si les recettes brutes de cette ligne 6taient inferieures au chiffre de 4,500 fr. par kilom.” (which they must be for years to come) “ stipule a 1’Article 35 de la Convention de Bagdad, la difference qui sera constatee a la fin de 1’annee sera reglee, elle aussi, sur Texcedent des revenus concedes a la Bette Publique Ottomane affecte a la garantie de la ligne, si le dit excedent y suffit, et dans le cas contraire la difference sera, de meme que I’insuffisance de la garantie, comblee par les premieres recettes des Aglmams des trois vilayets en question de 1’annee suivante.” This means that, assuming that the gross receipts do not attain 4,500 fr. per kilometre, and only attain, as is probable for the present, 2,500 fr. per kilometre, the Government must find the balance out of the surplus of the ceded revenues. Por the four sections this means 1,680,000 fr., or £T. 73,920, and for the remaining five sections 2,000,000 fr., or £ T. 88,000, or in all £ T. 161,920, which has again to come out of the surplus revenues of the Debt, and the Government’s share in the increase in the customs, originally £ T. 963,000, of which I have shown only £ T. 228,941, is already left, will be further reduced to £ T. 67,021, unless an arrangement is come to with the Bagdad Railway, on the ground that the assignment at this moment to the railway annuities of the new customs revenues will so cripple the finances and render reform so problematical, that the very existence of the country is in danger. I have left out of the question altogether any possible normal increase of the ceded revenues, since there would seem to be a tendency for these revenues to decrease for the moment, owing to the effects of the last tw T o harvests and to the contraband in salt and tobacco. These are passing and temporary difficulties, but it is not prudent to count upon any immediate increase in the six revenues. January 20, 1909.Register No. Minute Paper. b0~Jj Secret Department.

Name and Date. Subject.No. 490. (: 7 9S35) I BERLIN, November 3th, 1903. SLr:- The 'Berliner Tageblatt' of yesterday publishes % a article from their correspondent at Bagdad discussing the Question of the continuation of the trans-anatolian line as far as Mardtn in Northern Mesopotamia. Herr Mygind regrets that the agreement for the construction of this part of the Bagdad rall,va ,r should have been signed as long ago as last June, .vhen the old regime still prevailed in Turkey. Under the present Government, better terms, it is thought, nigh u have been obtained, and it would in any case have been insoructive to learn from the negotiations what views they hold with regard to the encourage ment oi foreign enterprise in the Ottoman TCmpire. The Young xurk party are held to combine a certain Chauvinistic ir Edward Gre-, Bart., M.P., &lt;3t*c •, &amp;c, j c&amp;c. iChauvinistic tendency to reserve Turkey for the Turks with a genuine appreciation of the necessity for introducing modern methods and means of communi cation into the country. The agreement arrived at in June provided for uh-- construction of the section of the line lying between the foot of the Taurus and Mardin within 7 years time. This condition was laid down out of regard for the existing stats of Turkish finances. I&lt; om a technical point of view this portion of the line could be completed in much less time. Not only the new Turkish Government but the whole commercial community of the .Anatolian hinterland would welcome ti'S rap la progress oi the line* and its only oppon- ento are in fact the Bedouin tribes, who see their sphere of independent activity gradually narrowed in, as the line advances, and the Anglo-Indian merchants who regard the whole enterprise with considerable jealousy, although it cannot at present interfere with their trade. But under the most favourable conditions the BagdadBagdad raii^vay canno'u In t/lis vvrit8r 1 s opinion roach i o3 uenninus on tins Gulf in loss 'than 10 yoaro,* and Herr Mygind consequently calls the attention of people in this country to a scheme for which he says a concession already exists, hut which is not at pres ent supported ty the necessary funds for its execu tion. .ihle is the establishment of a regular automo bile Conneru1on be Uv een Aleppo, the pre sent te rminus of the Syrian line, and Bagdad The first condition would be the construction of a good road. At pres ent, even by the slow 14 days journey in landaus, drawn by four horses, the conveyance of passengers between Bagdad and Aleppo - at a cost of from *^20- ~ is carried on fairly briskly. The new line would in addition acquire the postal traffic; which would be shortened by at least 10 days. When in three or four years time the section Taurus-Adana- Aleppo is completed, postal and passenger traffic would avoid the sea route via Beyrut, but travelling from Constantinople via Konia and Aleppo, would com plete the journey from Berlin to Bagdad in nine days* Threef 1 Tni g 6 laCd 1 j !catloin uhs GGl':Q;.'i£ oT construc- 'Uon, as at present agreed upon, would have to be introduced, however. In order to shorten the line as niuch as possible: 1. Alter crossing the Taurus, the present plan traces the line eastwards to Mosul through a desert track of country, leaving the cities oi Aintab, Url'a and Jfcrdln on the left. The line ought on the contrary to run more to the north so as , 4 to pass through these centres, 2. The section 1 rom Mosul to Bagdad should, as originally planned, run in a circular manner so as to keep in touch with the Persian frontier. This would establish a very valu able connexion with the cities of Karkuk, Erbll, and Chan lie in, whereas if, as at present contemplated, the line runs along the right bank of the Tigris, it will gain no traffic from the country through which It passes. 3. And most important of all, the line is, as at present agreed, to turn straight from Bag dad towards the Euphrates and after crossin? that river, follow its course by forming a wide circle to Basra, whence the Gulf would be reached et Kowelt. Instead ! \Ins toad of oh 1 s, It would os much mo rs s-dvEmtegeous, In Herr Myglnd's opinion, to revert to the former idea oi constructing the line to the east of the Tigris between that river and the frontier; so that tiiO line would ultimately terminate in Persian terri tory., Turkey herself can have no objection to this arrangement, which would enable her to keep better watch upon the 1ron11 ar; wnile Persia would w elcome tnis hi sans of opening up a wealthy province and strengthening her authority on her border lands; and England would be equally well pleased at the gain, ohus achieved, of 24 hours In her postal service to India. There would bo no more danger from English Intrigues and interference in a Persian port than in a Turkish harbour, and England would also be re lieved of her secret terror that Germany Intends to make of Kuweit a second Ki&amp;ochou. I have &amp;c., (Signed) ae Saiis.The length of the line is undefined, but it is certainly ^vell over 2,000 kilom. (exclusive of the old Anatolian line) with a guaiantee of lo,o00 fr. pei kilom., or 31,000,000 fr. in all per annum. The Anatolian Railway (about 1,000 kilom. in length) was comparatively easy to build, and passes through a peculiarly fertile part of the country near the capital, and yet it required 191,449/. last year in guarantees. Therefoie, taking the terms of the contract for that line as the basis for a calculation, the guarantees for the whole line would eventually, when the line is built, be at least 600,000/. a-year. But this sum will in all probability be considerably exceeded for two reasons. Under the old contract there is a construction guarantee at the rate of 11,000 fr. per kilom. per annum (or 880,000/. for the whole) which is invariable. There is next a guarantee for working expenses of 4,500 fr. It is unlikely that the Government’s share of the profits, after the latter guarantee has been met, will go far to meet the calls of the construction guarantee. Secondly, the nature of the country to be traversed by the sections now to be undertaken, to say nothing of that between Aleppo and Mosul, offers very different prospects of financial success from the fertile and populous districts near Constantinople. Under Articles 4 and 35 taken in conjunction, if the Turkish Government fail to provide the money for the two guarantees, which amount together to 15,500 fr., the Concession is fpso/ac/o prolonged. It would be convenient next to study the arrangements of June 1908, which differ, as will be seen, in some important particulars from the old contract. The Additional Convention signed on the 2nd June states that the Turkish Government have decided to prolong the line to Helif and Aleppo, a distance of 840 kilom. The guarantees per kilometre are divided into construction expenses at 11,000 fr. per annum and the working expenses at 4,500 fr. per annum, thus making a total of 15,500 fr., and are fixed on (1) the surplus of the ceded revenues; (2) on the sheep tax of the Vilayets of Konia, Adana, and Aleppo ; and (3) on the Government’s share of the profits of the line, i.e., after the gross receipts amount to 4,500 fr. per kilometre. The bonds to be issued for the cost of construction, according to Article 35 of the old Convention, shall be issued as described in the annexed Loan Convention. The most salient points of this Loan Convention (signed the same day) are as follows :— Article 1 : The Turkish Government will issue a loan in two series : 1. Series 2 for £ T. 4,752,000 (needing an annuity of £ T. 200,000); and 2. Series 3 for £ T. 5,236,000 (needing an annuity of £ T. 220,000), the annuities of which shall be the equivalent of the kilometric guarantee of 11,000 fr. per annum. Articles 2 and 3 : Bonds for series 2 are to be handed over at the present time, and the first coupon on them shall fall due on the 1st July, 1908, when the interest for the first half of 1908 shall be paid. Article 9 describes the guarantees given by the Turkish Government for payment of the interest on the loan ; they include, in addition to the surplus of the ceded revenues and the above-mentioned sheep taxes, the Government’s share in the profits of the line, and it is further provided that the yearly balance shall be worked out on the average of the profit and loss of all the kilometres en masse commune ot the line. It enumerates the prior charges already existing on the surplus of the ceded revenues, i.e., an annuity of £ T. 124,000, and certain fixed advances amounting to £ T. 850,000. Article 10 describes the guarantees given by the Railway Company for the payment of the loan, namely, the railway itself, its branches and rolling-stock, also its share of profit from the line, but the Turkish Government must make good to the Company any part of its share which it thus has to pay away. Article 16 : The Turkish Government retains the right to redeem the loan at par at any time to come on giving two months’ notice, or to convert it into a loan bearing a lower rate of interest. ^ With regard to Articles 1, 2, and 3, the bonds for series 2 havefnot yetjbeen handed over, and the coupon of the 1st July, 1908, has consequently fallen void; and, with regard to construction, it seems that at present nothing is being done beyond some surveying work. It is probable that the loan was divided into two series, of which one was to be issued subsequently, because the available surplus of the ceded revenues only amounts to £ T. 300,000, while the service of the whole loan requires £ T. 420,000 per fannum ; and it is not unlikely that the delay in issuing series 2 is due to the prior -charges on those revenues. 1 By Articles 9 and 10 the Bail way Company and the holders of the loan are both assured of the profits or interest, while the Turkish Government are responsible for all losses, even for those which might be incurred by the Bailway Company. ‘Any profits the Government might make are pledged as one of the guarantees of the loan, and so is the very line itself. This latter is so pledged by the Bailway Company, in whom, however, it is only vested during the period of the Concession, so that, in fact, it is the Government again which give it as a guarantee. It will be noticed that under Article 16 the Turkish Government have a very much more favourable chance of repurchasing these sections than was accorded them under the very onerous terms of Article 19 of the old contract, which apparently binds them for the remainder of the line. The re-establishment of the Constitution might give them an opportunity for submitting the whole contract to Parliament with a view either to denouncing it out and out from its present stage and so cutting short their losses, basing themselves not on the exacting nature of the contract, but on their imperious needs for expenditure in other directions, or else to annulling it after negotiation with the Company. It would seem from the second paragraph of the Additional Convention “ Texcedent des revenue concedes a la Dette Publique ayant ete affecte au prolongement de la ligne de Bagdad,” that some agreement had been come to by which all surplus of the ceded revenues is thus disposed of, or it may be held that such agreement is sufficiently contained in the w T ords quoted, and in this case any increase of revenues derived from the customs goes to the profit not of Turkey, but of the Bagdad Bailway, the customs, by the Decree of Muharrem, being one of the ceded revenues, although after the net receipts of the Debt reach £ T. 2,157,375 the remainder are divided between the Government and the Commissioners in the proportion of 75 and 25. As a matter of fact the net receipts already exceed that sum so that any revenue collected on the customs beyond the present amount would in practice have to be divided in this proportion. Such at least may be the contention of the Bailway Company; but so far as the Construction Loan (series 2 and 3) is concerned it would appear that, by the terms of the loan contract of the 2nd June, 1908, the Company are specially debarred from any claim on the 3 per cent, surtax. By Article 9 of that contract the Turkish Government affect to the service of the loan two new, series of the loan excess of the ceded revenues of the Public Debt, but “ deduction faite du produit de la surtaxe douaniere du 3 pour cent.” This exception was of course made because the produce of the 3 per cent.—or rather the 75 per cent., 3 of which is the share of the Ottoman Government—was to be affected to the needs of Macedonia, and it would seem as if the Powers, who assented to the surtax in order to provide funds for reforms in Macedonia, are now willing, in consideration of the financial embarrassments of the Empire, to allow it to be diverted from its original purpose, they are also entitled to make conditions as to the purposes to which it shall be applied. Again, the exclusion of the 3 per cent, from the service of the construction loan is quite unconditional, and it might be maintained that, in agreeing to forgo any lien on the surtax, the Company is absolutely debarred from accepting it as security except under a new contract. On the other hand, under the “ Convention Additionnelle ” the Bailway Company presumably claim the product of the surtax for the kilometric guarantee, but this contingency can only arise after the railway is actually built. One other point in this connection may be mentioned, viz., that the surtax has only been agreed to for a period of seven years from September 1906. It would seem useless for the Commission of the Debt to refuse their co-operation, as was suggested in Mr. Barclay’s telegram No. 128 of the 1st June, as it is bound to hand over the surplus of the ceded revenues to the Government, who are free to do what they please with them. The non-co-operation of the Debt would unfavourably affect the new bonds in the eyes of the investing public, but the security would be the same, and, supposing that new sources of revenue were to be assigned for the purposes of the railway, and their collection intrusted to the Debt, it is not likely that the obstacle would be insuperable were the Commission to refuse to undertake the task. There is a possibility that very strict attention to the ei cahier des charges regarding curves and gradients might prove too much for the Company, but it must be remembered that they still have in hand a balance of about £ T. 600,000 from the ■construction loan of the last section with which to meet the heavy cost of the section through the Taurus Mountains. With regard to the question of railway construction in Mesopotamia.The Bagdad Railway contract contains every stringent condition imaginable, except that of a monopoly. On the contrary, the Company is forbidden by Article 29 to exploit the section from Bagdad to Bussorah, even if it were built, until the principal line from. Konia to Bagdad is completed. Otherwise the only sphere absolutely reserved to the Company is that from the trunk line to the sea-coast between Mersina and Tripoli. 1 u s down the Th^iis from Mosul to Bagdad, and thence across the narrow part of the Jezire to KerbaJa, and then out into the desert on the west. This leaves the lovyerpart of the Jezire (Irak Arabi) untapped, and Sir William Willcocks observes that this is exactly the region through which the line ought to have run, as it is most fertile, and with a few quite simple irrigation works ought to surpass in richness even the valley of the Nile. It is probable that a line will be necessary for the construction ot the irrigation works, for the purposes of which Sir William Willcocks’ services have been engaged. In the evidence collected in the Secret Report of March 1907 Colonel Newmarch is alone m the opinion that the swamps in the Jezire would present a serious difficulty to railway construction. ‘ J All the other authorities consulted recommend railway rather than river com munication : they consider that the marshes are no serious obstacle, a great part of eni bemg dry, except at high river, and that the irrigation works proposed would rapn iy improve the conditions, and they are in favour of a line going east after passing Bagdad towards Erbd, Kerkuk, and Khanikin, where there are alleged to be prospects °f rn l et f 0l r^ &amp; ^ and ° f a verj considerable tr ade. It is observed that the trade oi tne wnole Bagdad Railway passes a commercial watershed at Mosul, all streams of that town flowing down towards the Gulf, while Mr. Consul Crow’s Report shows the gieat value of the trade and shipping at Bussorah and Bagdad. In combination with these prospects, Sir J. Mackay s proposal for a Government guarantee of 3 per cent, on the capital expended on the line ought to be sufficient to induce a Company to come forwmd and the question suggested by the last paragraph of the Foreign Office Office Memorandum is whether there is such a Company ready to undertake the work Sublime P t W ° U d bG Premature t0 make an inti “ a tion of the nature suggested to the # IfDo, i j „ JlT^ [This Document ib tlie Property of His Britannic Majesty's Governmpm. 5s ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. / ^ /' CONFIDENTIAL. 4PR i%q r&gt; [March 22.] Section 3. i?e “''iiii* L10802] (No. 191.)

Hardinge replied that, after the friendly discussions which had taken place last autumn both at Mindsor and in London, His Majesty’s Government were waiting for the initiative of the German Government, since it had then been decided by Herr von Schon, apparently with the Emperor’s approval, that, after certain discussions with the Russian Government had been concluded, a “ Conference a quatre ” should be summoned at Berlin, when a scheme of co-operation should be discussed ; for this step His Majesty’s Government were still anxiously waiting. Count Metternich said that his Government had renounced the idea of summoning such a Conference, and, in reply to a further inquiry, he said that he himself had strongly opposed any such arrangement; that he had not at all approved what had taken place at Windsor ; and that he had given as his reason that such a Conference was foredoomed to failure, and would only serve to accentuate the difference between Germany and the three other Powers, since Germany would always be in a minority of one to three. It was therefore no longer proposed to have such a Conference, but Germany would always be ready to discuss with His Majesty’s Government the question of a terminus on the Persian Gulf. I am, &amp;c.

(No. 328.) Sir, Berlin, July 25, 1908. I HAVE the honour to report that the “National Zeitung ” publishes the following letter from its correspondent at Konia with regard to the Bagdad Railway :— “ On Eriday last, the 10th July, large numbers of the inhabitants of Konia came to the station to welcome the advent of the German railway constructors. At the head of these was Engineer Ernst Mackensen. In his company were the Engineers Habich and Winkler and the Geologist Professor Hoyer. Herr Mackensen, who is well known in the district, received a warm welcome from the inhabitants, which testified to the affectionate sentiments with which Germany is regarded in the district. Their enthusiasm was also aroused by the fact that great poverty is prevalent in the district, and the hope is entertained that this may be relieved by the employment which will be obtained on the railway. “ Herr Mackensen’s party is not the first to arrive in Asia Minor in connection with the new railway. A week ago a number of engineers passed through Konia on their way to Eregli, and, at the same time as Herr Mackensen arrived at Konia, twenty-six German engineers travelled, via Mersina and Adana, to the country which is to be surveyed. “ Herr Mackensen and the gentlemen accompanying him visited the Yali on the day subsequent to their arrival, and on the same evening left Konia for the neighbourhood of Aleppo, where it is expected they will spend some seven weeks.” I have, &amp;c. (Signed) J. de SALIS. [1859 dtf—3][This Dflonnent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Goyariimpnt-] I HAVE the honour to forward herewith an extract of a despatch from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Konia with regard to the Bagdad Railway. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Bagdad Railway. —The forward construction contract has again been undertaken by Messrs. Holtzman. The Chief Engineer, Mr. Mackensen, and staff are daily expected. The Second Engineer, Mr. Mavrogordato, and a survey staff are leaving Konia for Adana, whence they will survey an alternative railway route by the Kharkun River. This route would take the railway northward to the district of Nigde before the eastward turn was made. It is not, however, considered probable that the carefully surveyed route by Ullu Kysshla, Bozanti, and the Chakut Su will be abandoned. The Kharkun is to be visited in deference to local Turkish opinion, which declared it to be the easier way. But a general gradient so desirable for a. railway is not very well understood by non-professional people accustomed to think in hours and horses. I learn various details of the proposed Bozanti route from the construction Company, the probable crossings and tunnels, &amp;c., but I doubt whether they are of any general interest, and they are liable to be changed. The most difficult part appears to be the gorge of the Chakut Su, which will have to be tunnelled; but from there to Adana the gradient is regular. There is also a difficult piece from near forsook Han to below Chifte Han, which it is said will involve a tunnel 3 kilom. long. In all the number of tunnels is likely to be very large. The existing cart-road is to be remade in places, in order to avoid too many level crossings. It is not likely that much work other than the Kharkun survey and the erection of engineers’ houses near the Charkut Su will be carried through from the Boulgourlou end before the winter. Adana should be able to do more. I hear that the original plan included a line from Adana to Castabol, where a natural harbour exists, then by the coast to a few miles north of Alexandretta, whence the Beylan Pass can easily be climbed and crossed by a tunnel. This plan was changed by the personal wish of the Sultan, who held that such a line could be interrupted from the sea ; whereas a Bagdad- Syrian Railway, Adana to Killis, was safer from attack. From this change resulted the buying by the Bagdad Company of the shares of the Mersina Railway, and a survey of Mersina Harbour. The necessary works at Mersina will be so costly that I cannot help thinking that Castabol may after all be selected as the port. For trade and British interests it will be preferable. Even now a large part of the expoit from Adana Province is shipped at Ayas Bay. It is said that, with a view to the easier landing of rails, &amp;c., a subsidiary line to Castabol is projected, which, according to the plan, is to be destroyed on the completion of the railway Apart from this somewhat indefinite date, it does not seem likely that this subsidiary line once made wil be found so useful and profitable, that it will seem a pity to destroy it, even if the policy which now objects to it should not at that distant time be changed, t here remains as an argument for either not making it or destroying it when once made the purchase of the Mersina Railway shares. They are worth but little now and would lose even that little by the construction of a railway to Castabol. It is, however, remarkable how little land on the sea front of Mersina is as yet known to be in the hands of the Section 1. [July 27.] (No. 409.) Sir, Mr. G.

ON the occasion of the German Emperor’s visit to Windsor last November the subject of the Bagdad Railway came under discussion. Mr. Haldane, who discussed the subject with His Majesty at two separate audiences, handed to His Majesty a Memorandum of a private conversation with Sir E. Grey, intimating that His Majesty’s Government could not discuss the question with Germany alone, hut only together with Erance and Russia, whose interests were also involved. The Emperor at first expressed doubt as to whether discussion d quatre was practicable; but, after learning from his Eoreign Secretary that certain pourparlers with Russia had already taken place he modified this view, and in the second interview with Mr. Haldane, which was in the early morning of the 15th November, he stated that he did not anticipate any difficulty. At this interview Herr von Schoen and Count Metternich were both present. As a result, after a long discussion, the Emperor said that he cordially concurred in the Memorandum which had been handed to him as a basis on which to proceed; that the understanding was complete; and that he would like to get on as quickly as possible. He was very hopeful that good business would come to all the four Powers concerned, and he would ask Herr von Schoen to proceed at once to London to take the initiative by making a proposal from Germany. By the end of this interview Count Metternich’s attitude, which had at first been critical, had become so greatly modified that he observed that there should be no difficulty about a discussion d quatre, and it was both legitimate and natural that His Majesty’s Government should wish to proceed in full consultation with Erance and Russia. On the 15th November Herr von Schoen called at the Eoreign Office and saw Sir E. Grey. He expressed great satisfaction at the prospect of now coming to an agreement with His Majesty’s Government about the Bagdad Railway, and recognized their desire to have a gate at the Persian Gulf end. He recognized that the Memo randum communicated by Mr. Haldane formed a practicable basis for discussion. Sir E. Grey assumed that His Majesty’s Government should wait till they heard from the German Government. Herr von Schoen said he must consult M. Isvolsky to see whether full discussion between the four Powers might not be begun without further carrying discussion with Russia a stage further. On the 25th June Count Metternich called at the Eoreign Office, and, in the course of conversation with Sir C. Hardinge, stated that his Government had renounced the idea of summoning a Conference d quatre at Berlin. The Ambassador himself had strongly opposed such an arrangement, and he had not at all approved of what had taken place at Windsor, on the ground that such a Conference as that proposed was foredoomed to failure, and would only serve to accentuate the difference between Germany and the three other Powers. It was therefore no longer proposed to have such a Conference, but Germany would always be ready to discuss with His Majesty’s Government the question of a terminus on the Persian Gulf. Foreign Office, July 3, 1908.6 3 Traffic—An increase of 7,516 passengers travelling over the line has been shown over”1906 ; 5,204 of these were passengers on the Bagdad Railway, and 2,312 passing to the Anatolian lines. ^ v . An increase of 9,950 tons of freight is shown over that carried over the line m 1906. This is to be attributed to the more favourable harvest in 190/ to that of 1906.

[19733] Mr - Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 9.) (No. 300.) y y ^ ir ’ 7 Therapia, June 2, 1908. W1IH reference to my telegram No. 128 of yesterday, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of the Bagdad Bailway Loan Contract which is to be submitted to the Council of the Public Debt at its meeting to-day. It will be noticed tnat the Debt Administration is to be charged with a consider- able amount of work in connection with the service of the loan. The role assigned to the Debt cannot fail to enhance the value of the bonds by making them more popular amongst investors. ^ Its obligation as regards the Government share in the surplus of t e ceded revenues is at present confined to handing over this surplus to the Turkish Government, and it^is clearly open to the Administration to refuse to undertake the new work which it is now intended to throw upon them. Their refusal to assist could not alter the fact that the Germans have secured the surplus of the ceded revenues for t e Bagdad Bailway, but it could hardly fail to have the effect of reducing the issue price of the bonds, and after consultation with the Delegate of the British bondholders who is communicating with his Council in London, I have thought it well to inquire • aS -^ ie it is desired that Sir Adam Block should observe m this matter. Sir Adam Block alone could do nothing, but assisted by the French Delegate ana the Delegate of the Ottoman Bank, he could carry his point. Commandant Berger, the President of the Council, is, as might he expected, ready to sign the contract, and it would need very strong instructions from Paris to make him take the opposite line. The terms of the contract differ in several particulars from the resume of the toft Convention given out by the Anatolian Bailway Company (see my despatch Iso. 27o of. the 24th ultimo). It will be observed that the surplus of the ceded revenues is pledged not from 1913, but from any time after the repayment of the temporary charges. These are calculated in the contract at £ T. 850,000, but Sir Adam Block has pointed out to me that this is too low an estimate, as it does not take into account the interest on the advances named. Nevertheless, it may reason ably he expected that these charges will he cleared off by the end of 1910 or' early in It will also be noticed that the sheep tax of the vilayets of Adana and Konia is eaimaiked, in addition to that of Aleppo, as subsidiary guarantee, subject to a charo , e of £T. 40,000, which sum is already pledged for another purpose, ie., the Bussian war indemnity. In conclusion, I beg to point out that the Government’s share in the surplus of the ceded revenues is pledged by the contract to the extent of £T. 420,000 a-year. At present, after meeting the permanent charges upon it, the Government’s , share onlv amounts to some £ T. 300,000. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BABCLAY. Inclosure in No. 1.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 114 of yesterday, I have the honour to report that the Anatolian Kaiiway Company have now presented to the Ministry of Public Works two draft Conventions, the one technical and the other financial, respecting the details of the extension of the Bagdad Railway from Bulgurlu to Halif, the point at which the branch to Mardin is to leave the main line. According to these Conventions the plans and specifications for the work are to be submitted within a year, and eight years are to be allowed for the completion of the extension. Including a branch line from Telhabesh to Aleppo (40 kilom.), the length of line to be laid is 840 kilom., involving a total kilometric guarantee of 13,020,000 fr (11,000 fr. per kilom. for construction and 4,500 fr. for working), or 572,000h’a-year! To secure this the Government’s share in the surplus of the ceded revenues is pledged from 1913, and I understand that the sheep tax in the Aleppo Vilayet, and nofi as reported in my telegram of yesterday, the Anatolian Railway tithes surplus, is assigned as additional guarantee. Should these two sources prove insufficient, the deficiency is to be made good from the general revenues of the Empire. The draft Conventions provide for a loan of 227,000,000 fr. nominal at 4 per cent, interest and ’08 per cent, sinking fund, to be issued as the progress of the construction work requires. As the plans are not needed for a year, it seems unlikely that the work will begin before this time next year, and the construction being spread over eight years, the contemplated loan is not likely to over-tax the resources of the money market in Berlin. r liftvp (Signed) ’ G.

I HAVE the honour to report that a telegram from Constantinople has been published in the German papers, stating that the Porte has agreed to the construction of a further section of 800 kilorn. of the Bagdad Railway. This piece of news is greeted with much jubilation; it is pointed out that this section includes the most difficult and expensive part of the line, viz., the crossing of the Taurus, so that once this section is completed, the construction of the remainder of the line to Bagdad cannot present many difficulties. The ' Berliner Neueste Nachrichten ” considers the obtaining of this Concession a great feat of German diplomacy and a proof of the falseness of the statements frequently made in foreign papers as to the wane of German influence at Constantinople. The “ National Zeitung ” bases its pleasure at the news rather on the financial signification, for, in its opinion, the legends of Germany being unable to complete the scheme without foreign assistance will thus be disproved. Both papers think it desirable to add that Germany has no political intentions or ambitions in that part of the world, and that the railway is to be looked upon as a purely commercial and civilizing undertaking. The “ National Zeitung ” also remarks that though Germany is thoroughly capable of building the line herself, she would gladly allow foreign capital to participate on condition that she retains the complete management of the line, I have, &amp;c.

It may be that this confident assurance is based on expectations of accommodation from Pans now that the Heraklea question is settled, but it seems more probable that it points to a financial arrangement with Germany which would no doubt, besides supplying the money required to pay off the arrears in Macedonia, enable the Turkish Government to clear off the temporary charges on the surplus of the ceded revenues which, as you are aware, would not in the ordinary course be paid off before 1911. The favourable turn in the German negotiations is doubtless due to the pressure of the German Emperor when he received Turkhan Pasha’s Mission sent by the Sultan to greet ilis Majesty on the occasion of his visit to Corfu.

ON the 17th October, 1902, the cc Novoe Vremya ” was one of the first to give in general outline the substance of the Convention concluded by the Turkish Minister of Commerce and Public Works. Zihni Pasha, with Dr. Kurtzander, Chief Director of the Imperial Ottoman Anatolian Railway, regarding the construction of the Bagdad line, destined to join Haidar Pasha in Asia Minor with Koweit, or, more correctly, Hamburg with the Persian Gulf and India. Since that time, notwithstanding the hindrances encountered by Germany in the European Concert, and the impossibility of guaranteeing the whole undertaking financially, the line has been carried through as far as Konia, that is to say, through territory both thickly populated and, from the topographical point of view, not presenting any special difficulties. These six years have been a period of persevering work carried on behind the scenes, of taking advantage of Court influences and international differences, with the object of obtaining the Government subsidy, without which the necessary capital of 700,000,000 fr. could not be realized. At the present time all that could be achieved by German capital, with the energetic co-operation of the Government in the guise of the Deutsche Bank, has been realized, and Germany has been brought face to face with the necessity of resorting to outside assistance. As yet this is only talked of in whispers, and business is being carried on in secret with those persons who are able to furnish the means. But, if not to-day, to-morrow the Bagdad line will become the subject of an international exchange of views and a weighing of those compensations in consideration of which the purse of Prance, and perhaps of other Powers, might render the necessary support to the undertaking now at a standstill. A compensation of this description as regards the first-named would appear probable in Morocco, where Germany has with foresight created difficulties for Prance, in order, at her own time, to dispel them for a corresponding recompense. _ The Bagdad Railway, both from the economical and the political point of view, apart from its world-wide importance, has specially serious significance for us. This is why, at the moment when the question is passing from the passive to the active phase, it is necessary to carefully consider it, even if only in its general aspects. Germany, being at the present moment, if not at a period of financial crisis, at any rate of scarcity of capital, cannot think of realizing the necessary 700 millions [2971 y —1]2 without outside help. The matter is not merely that such a sum is not availahlp ^ the Berlin market, hut there is the difficulty of finding any sources from which thie sum could he guaranteed at even a minimum rate of interest, for it is impossible e™ with the greatest optimism, to count upon the Bagdad Railway paying its way for thp first ten to fifteen years.

SECRET. [15664] No. 1. War Office to Foreign Office,—{Received May 7.) THE Director of Military Operations presents his compliments to the Under secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and begs to forward, for his information, a copy of a Report recently received from Mr. David Eraser, who is now travelling in Asia Minor on behalf of the “Times,” giving an account of a journey over the°proposed route for the second section of the Bagdad Railway. War Office, May 6, 1908. Inclosure in No. 1. Report by Mr. Fraser respecting the Bagdad Railway. NOTES on the second section of the Bagdad Railway, compiled by the under signed during a journey across the Taurus in December 1907. Much of the journey was made in darkness or driving rain, which obscured a view of the country. The writer is therefore indebted to information obtained from an article by Professor Sir W. M. Ramsay (“ Cilicia, Tarsus, and the Great Taurus Pass,” “ Geographical Journal,” October 1903), for particulars not personally observed. (Signed) DAVID ERASER, Aleppo, April 5, 1908. The existing section of the Bagdad Railway, from Konia to Bulgurlii, 200 kilom. in length, traverses a perfectly level plain until within 2 miles of the terminal station. Pour miles east of Eregli station there occurs the terrace-like arrangement of low rolling hills, which fringes this part of the plateau of Asia Minor. Eregli is near the edge of the plateau, Bulgurlii is just within the fringe, and any extension beyond the latter station involves the line in the broken ground which divides the plateau from the low level sea coast littoral. The plateau at Eregli is some 3,600 feet above the sea, wdiereas Adana, the projected terminus for the next section of the Bagdad Railway, is no more than 63 feet above sea level. It is the transition from the high to the lower level, to be compassed only through complicated hill and mountain systems, that constitutes a formidable difficulty to the construction of the second section of the railway. Between Konia and Eregli, as mentioned in former notes, construction of the first section of the Bagdad Railway was phenomenally easy. Pour miles east of Eregli the line begins to rise by easy gradients to Bulgurlii, which is probably not more than 60 or 80 feet above the level of the adjacent plain. The station is the only building in sight, as the village after which it is named is situated in the plain some I miles to the north-east. All around Bulgarin Station is desert without any signs of cultivation, and the surrounding country is probably valueless except as pasture lan i. It is evident that the engineers Tvere hard put to it to complete the stipulated distance of 200 kilom. without incurring undue expense. The absolute end of the line lies in a stony hollow a kilometer beyond the station. The ends of the rails are poked nakedly forward from the low embankment in which they rest, and point at a steady ascent that could not be surmounted except by deep cutting through solid rock. The section ends absolutely at the psychological moment from a financial point of view, for additional construction would have involved a totally different scale of expenditure. [2971 ?-l] BOne is templed to think that the engineers of the railway exercised some skill in so aptly arranging for completion of the 200 kilom. demanded by the terms of the Convention, for in approaching Bulgurlii Station the line makes a very wide circuit which impresses the layman as totally unnecessary. The last 9 kilom. of the section forcibly suggest the perniciousness of the guarantee system as followed in Turkey. There is some reason in the carrying of a railway to Eregli, but none whatever in the extension beyond. But as the terms of the Convention gave the Bailway Companv the opportunity of making enormous profit in construction, these 9 unnecessary kilom. were made, and now cost Turkey for guarantee no less than 5,000/. annuallv. Discussion between the Bailway Company and the Turkish Government might easiiy have resulted in this senseless piece of expenditure being avoided, had one of the parties been disposed to play fair and to recognize that in some degree they were bound to consider the interests of the country in which they were working. But the Conven tion stipulates for 200 kilom. of railway in exchange for bonds for 54,000,000 fr., 270,000 fr. per kilometre. As construction can hardly have cost more than half the sum thus provided, the making of these last 9 kilom. meant a profit to the shaie- holders of the Company of nearly 50,000/. In discussing construction of the second section of the railway, from Bulgurlii to Adana, it wall simplify explanation if the country to be traversed is divided into subsections showing the different character of the ground at various points, as follows (a.) Erom Bulgurlii to Ula-Kishla, including the rise of 1,800 feet from the Eregli Plain to the highest point which the railway will be required to touch. (&amp;.) The descent from TJla-Kishla to Bozanti, a drop of 2,200 feet. (c.)Transit of the spur of the Taurus Mountains, Bulghar Dagh, which intervenes between the broken country fringing the Eregli Plain and the low-level Cilician Plain. (d.) Descent from the above to the terminus at Adana, a drop of about 3,000 feet. Sub-section (a). Bulgurlu to Ela-Kishla is 35 kilometres = say 22 miles. A rise of ] ,800 feet in this distance gives a general grade of about 1 in 63. As the measurement of 22 miles is along the Turkish post road, which winds in and out of the hills, the actual grade from point to point would be much greater, hardly less than 1 in 50. These figures indicate the difficulty presented by this part of the projected railway. In addition to the grading there is, of course, the character of the ground to be considered. Low hills lie in long folds with innumerable dips and depressions between. A line traversing the hills and compelled to consider grades would be forced to make wide curves and diversions from the true direction, The sandy and gravelly soil, as far as I could observe, covered solid rock, the cutting into of which would be almost continuous. An advantage is that this region of rolling hills gives a wide choice of ground, and that detours of several miles on either side of the post road would ^be possible. Of the 35 kilometres involved, 25 represent ascent to the watershed, 5,400 feet, 5 kilometres are a sloping plateau on the top of the watershed w here construction wuuld be comparatively easy, and 3 kilometres slightly down to Ula-Kishla. Erom the watershed to Ula-Kishla the total drop is 600 feet, and the giound coi responds in character very nearly to that on the w^estern side of the watershed. Sub-section (b). Ula-Kiskla to Bozanti, 43 kilometres, drop of 2,260 feet, giving general grade of 1 in 63. At Ula-Kishla there occurs a remarkable change in the character of the country, Hitherto the ground has been open and rolling, and entirely devoid of engineering difficulties. Irom Ula-Kishla to Bozanti, on the contrary, every mile of the projected railway will be difficult and expensive of construction. The rolling hills give way to high jagged ridges which turn on.either side of the post road, and from the regions on either hand. The wide upland valley east of Ula-Kishla changes into a deep lavine, the bottom of which is scoured by a plunging mountain stream. Hu oughout the 4 3 kilometres there are practically no flats bordering the river, for the precipitous side of the ravine run right dowm to the water’s edge. The existingroad, the result of thousands of years of tinkering and buihlino* , put out of the solid roek. Considering that grad^” will'ranS betweLTln loti 1 in 80, in a narrow ravine which permits of no wide curves in sweeps it wOl l* 1 understood that the railroad must go straight down this narrow gut in the mountains 6 taking from side o side m the endeavour to maintain a reasonable erat Tnd tn avoid broad spurs of obtruding rock.

It is the best road I have seen m lurkey, broad, well-graded, free of sharp turns, and well-surfaced When washed out it is easily repaired, owing to its rocky bed. As an alternative route in case of break-down of the railway, it would be highly valuable foi the transport of troops and stores, and would carry a light military line with ease allowing for a double car track besides, except at certain points where deep cutting contract space This road is, of course, the property of the Turkish Government and in view of its strategic value as an aid to the railway in case of emeroencv it is nnite certain that the Turks will not allow the Railway Company to interfere with it Vhe existence of this road occupying as it does at a great number of points the best natural ground, will add considerably to the difficulties of construction as it will force upon the engineers bridging and deviation which would not otherwise have been necessary. Ihe road by which the post travels from Eregli is very poor extremely heavy in the neighbourhood of Eregli, and rough after entering the hills ’The Turks however, are embanking the boggy ground close to Eregli, and the road will be greatly improved hereafter. It is passable throughout to field artillery but heavy guns would be difficult of transport. Near Uia-Kishla is encountered the (mod road discussed above, evidently a strategic road, said to he equally good all the way to Caesarea, 120 miles to the north-east, though this is not certain. ' Sub-section (c). The very ravine described above debouches into a curiaus valley known in ancient times as Polandos, now as the Vale of Bozanti. Completelv girt round by magnificent mountains it lies at a level of about 2,700 feet, and measures roughly 4 miles long, and 1^- broad. Here the river Ghakut from the ravine is greatly magnified by the increased area, and becomes an important stream. Both road and river are now confronted by that spur of the Taurus, known as the Bulghar Dagh, which constitutes the principal difficulty in construction of the Bagdad Railway. The river, after leaving the vale, winds in and out of deep and impassable gorges and then plunges underground, to emerge on the other side of the obstruction at some miles distance. Unfortunately I had no time to examine for myself, hut these facts in regard to the course of the river are accepted by well-known authorities, such as Sir William Ramsay. The German plan is to follow the river along its gorges and then to tunnel to the other side. Bridging and tunnelling will amount to many kilometres, and construction will be on the most expensive scale. Many difficult problems will confront the engineers, and the railway, if ever made, will be extremely vulnerable to attack, as the destruction of a single bridge or funnel will throw it out of work for months. The post road leaves the Vale of Bosanti in a southerly direction, and immediately encounters the high ridge of the Bulghar Dagh, under which the Chakut flows some miles further east. There is a climb of 1,500 feet, over a very bad road, in 10 miles, ending at the Tekir Plateau, a level plain about 2 miles long and 1 mile broad, regarded in past times, as it still is, the strategic key to the Cilician Plain below. The highest point of the plateau is 4,300 feet. It is the abrupt character of this obstruction that has forced the German engineers to adopt, on paper, the plan of following the Chakut Su. Sul-section (d). Having risen probably 1,000 feet in its course down the gorge of the Chakut Su, the railway is planned to pierce the obstruction that lies before it at a height of [2971 1] B 2~~~r | 4 between 3,000 or 4,000 feet. Emerging on the other side at a corresponding height there lies before it the long descent to Adana. Erom Adana I rode a short way in the direction from which the railway is expected to come, and found the country extremely rough and broken, consisting of rock, with a thin covering of gorse, which will require much blasting and cutting. Further away from Adana, and nearer the point of exit from the mountains, I was informed that the valley down which the railway is to come is narrow, rocky, and broken, and that for some distance construction difficulties will resemble those found between Ula - Kishla and Bosanti. The post road, by which I travelled, descends from Tekir by a long narrow ravine, in which is situated the famous Cilician Gate. The ravine is some 15 miles long, and greatly resembles in character the descent from Ula-Kishla and Bozanti. Beyond it the country opens out considerably, and the last 24 miles to the plain consists of long low folds of ground, lying in terraces one below the other. Below Tekir the road recovers its character, and is well graded and surfaced throughout the remainder of the distance to the plain. General Notes. I am inclined to think that the plan to tunnel the Bulghar Dagh may not turn out to be the best. The expense will be very great, the danger from wash-outs, owing to the very heavy storms prevalent in this region at certain times of the year, will be very great, while liability to landslips and avalanches, &amp;c., in so wild a neighbourhood must not he overlooked. German scientists, believed by well-informed people in Adana to be engineers, have been spending much time in exploring the mountains near, and it is not improbable that they are seeking an alternative route. My own impression is that it may ultimately be divided to follow the post road rather than the river, a course that is not without advantage. The drop from Tekir Tvould be greater than that involved by the other route, hut there would be the advantage of having to traverse a shorter distance of broken country betore emerging on the plain. The Adana-Mersina Bail way has recently passed into German control. The chief officials are now German, and the system of management and accounts employed in the Anatolian Railways has been adopted. With this short line in the hands of people whose interests are identical with those composing the Bagdad Railway Company, the smaller line could be used to facilitate progress of the greater project. Junction of the two near Tarsus, where the post road comes out of the hills, would save about 20 miles of construction, and w r ould not affect the value of the Bagdad scheme. Erom a commercial point of view the second section of the Bagdad Railway must be a dead loss, for the country traversed is practically without population, and there is no cultivable land except the small area of Bozanti Yale. Despite the presence of the railway at Eregli grain in the neighbourhood is dispatched in large quantity by canal to the coast at Mersina rather than by rail to Constantinople. High railway rates account for this anomalous state of affairs, which, however, is not likely to continue as there is a general tendency to low r er charges on the Anatolian railways. Locally the Bagdad Railway will of course do little or no work, while it is difficult to see that through goods traffic, when the line is extended to Aleppo, will be important owing to the proximity of the principal markets to the sea. Erom the Turkish point of view the chief value of the line must be for many years to come strategic rather than economic, wdiile in German eyes the kilometric guarantee is the important consideration. It is hardly necessary to say anything about a delay in proceeding with con struction of the second section of the railway, for it has been fully discussed in the press. The terms of the Convention provide for Turkish bonds of the value of 54,000,000 fr. to be handed over to the Railway Company as provision for construction expenses. These bonds, in the case of the first section, were floated in Europe and brought in a return, approximately, of 1,800,400/. Actual construction cost no more, according to the estimate of competent authorities, than 800,000/., the result being that the shareholders of the Company pocketed 1,000,000/. The same financial arrangements held good for section 2, but matters work out very differently, for instead of costing 800,000/. to make the new section will cost nearly 3,000,000/. owing to the natural difficulties detailed above. The Company, therefore, does not care to lace a situation wherein they will be obliged to disgorge not only their million ofprofit in the first section but a substantial sum besirloi? Tf i delay is due to Turkish inability to allocate revenues for Ihe pLment tUe the necessary bonds, but I do not believe that this is the ti-ue c(ns P ^ Wl w? 31 011 no doubt that it would puzzle the Turks to find nearly 1 000 onn/ o W n lle . tbere ls the guarantee in all the sections of the railway it is ouite motlu ’ to secure that they cannot find the 90 , 0001 . annually^ t ^ section in difficulty lies in the disinclination of the Germa. fir a cier t o q n with ° rCal already pocketed. uers t0 P aifc ''‘t 11 moneyz i In any further communica tion on this iubject, pleas* (juofc* *&gt;■ Mid address— The Under-Secretary of Stato, Toreign Office, Loudon. 3Z&lt;, The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop iy of the under-mentioned paper.

The Frankfurter Zeitung learns from Constanti nople that the Turkish Council of Ministers has unanimously decided to recommend to the Sultan the construction of four additional sections of the Baghdad Railway, which would advance the line a distance of 800 kilometres. It is believed that the necessary Irade will shortly be issued, and that the work will be begun without further delay. This extension would include the Taurus section of the line, which has always been described as presenting greater difficulties than any other section. The chief town along the. projected track of the railway is Mardin, which lies at a distance of about 800 kilometres from Eregli, the present terminus, and is an important centre some 200 kilometres north-west of Mosul. It is believed that from this point onwards the difficulties which will have to be surmounted in the plains of the Tigris and the Euphrates will prove less considerable. CONSTANTINOPLE, May 20 * As the result of the efforts, during the past six weeks, of the Anatolian Railway Company, supported by German diplomacy, the objection of the Porte to mortgaging the surplus of the old ceded revenues of the Ottoman public debt towards guaranteeing further sections of the Baghdad Railway has been overcome, and the Council of Ministers on Sunday addressed a Mazbata to the Imperial Chancellery recommend ing the building of four sections—namely, from Bulgurlu to Helif junction, the station for Mardin, a total length of 840 kilometres, and the pledging of the above-mentioned surplus from the year 1913 for the purpose of the kilometric guarantee. The Imperial sanction to the Mazbata will doubtless follow when the Anatolian Railway Company will sign the necessary conventions with the Porte. /'TTftXfian, L»(-ijmni«ix.uj }»uinrsHrtrpy-T 3 ier-fTggg 3 --wxj ironiry ttn attempt to combine intorcbange*feility of the personnel of the Australian naval force with that of the Royal .Navy, together with complete control by the Common wealth Government over the materiel and personnel of that force while actually serving in tho Australian vessels. lac scheme as put forward by Mr. Donkin is in bare out line, and requires much amplification before it can be discussed with advantage, while the difficulties inherent m the scheme itself are very groat.

Block, showing the rate atwhicn the present floating charges on the surplus of the ceded revenues will be cleared on:— Present floating' charges.. Will be paid off in June 1908 Add interest, say .. Will be paid off in June 1909 Add interest, say .. Will be paid off in June 1910 Add interest, say.. Add a further advance made in the last few days by the Anatolian Railway Company ..

These temporary charges in themselves need not, of course, prove an insuperable obstacle to the surplus being used for a railway loan. They could be funded, or a formal under taking on the part of the Ottoman Government ear-marking it for the Bagdad Railway, after the present floating charges have been paid off, would doubtless satisfy the Railway Company. What is, however, somewhat remarkable, is that the extension of the railway should be mooted at a time when the Berlin market is under the strain of large impending loans. It would seem as though the Railway Company need not depend for funds exclusively on Berlin. In the course of conversation on the 11th instant the Grand Vizier again assured me that he was opposed to the hypothecation of the surplus of the ceded revenues for the Bagdad Railway, and that he would do his utmost to prevent it. I have no doubt as to his Highness’ sincerity on this point, as the surplus is a most convenient security for advances when the financial strain becomes more than usually acute, and it would naturally be very distasteful to the Porte to see it permanently tied up. At the same time there is no doubt that the Sultan is anxious to see the railway extended as far as Aleppo so as to establish through connection with the Hedjaz. It will not have escaped your notice that in the Memorandum forwarded in my despatch No. 171, it is stated that if the railway is only to be prolonged as far as Aleppo, the Company demands an increase in the construction kilometric guarantee to 13,500 fr., or £ T. 2,500 more than that provided for by their Convention. I understand that in this case the guarantees for the further sections would be reduced pro tanto. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G.

As you are aware, the surplus of the ceded revenues, which is looked to as security for the necessary construction loan, was at the end of last year already pledged well into 1910. Since then Sir Nicholas O’Conor has reported a further charge upon it of £ T. 200,000 as security for a loan made to the Government hy the Anatolian Railway Company, and quite recently this charge has been increased hy a further £ T. 100,000. I do not know how it is proposed to clear off these charges so as to free the surplus for the purpose now in view. A notice in the Turkish press which appeared two or three days ago to the effect that the Anatolian Railway Company [sic] had applied to the Minister of Public Works for the extension of the Bagdad Railway to Aleppo afforded me a favourable opportunity for delivering the hint indicated in your telegram No. l 66 of the 4th instant. I conveyed the message yesterday to the Grand Vizier, who, in his reply, confirmed my information that he was opposed to the prolongation of the railway. As regards the Macedonian deficit, his Highness said that, if the proceeds of the 3 per cent, surtax came up to expectations, the deficit would gradually he cleared off in the natural course. This is no doubt true if the next two or three years show favourable customs receipts, hut the outlook for the current year is not promising, as the depression following the recent commercial crisis is likely to react for some time on the import trade. The hint given the Grand Vizier will of course reach the Sultan, and it should strengthen his Highness* hands in resisting the German demands. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY.

Isvolsky had, however, absolutely refused to bind the Russian Government to build the branch railway, on the ground that when railway construction was opened in Persia, on the expiry of the Railway Convention, it would probably be to Russia’s interest to build some other railway first, and that in any case, before agreeing to the construction of a branch of the Bagdad Railway through Persia, Germany must recognize the Russian sphere of influence in Persia. When these terms had been agreed to, the Russian Government would be ready to consider the question of participation in the Bagdad Railway, and would be ready to discuss the terms d quatre or separately as the other Powers might decide.

Herr von Schon replied that the Bagdad Railway and the Anglo-Russian Agreement had nothing to do with one another. The Agreement between the two Powers regarding Thibet, Afghanistan, and Persia deals only with commercial interests. Germany is only interested in the commercial development of Persia. The Contracting Powers have disclaimed any intention of interfering with the rights of other Powers. In the Treaty, “ equal opportunities in commercial matters for all nations ” is expressly laid down. The Bagdad Railway is, by the Sultan’s concession, a Turkish undertaking with a German character. The extension of the line depends upon the ability of the Turkish Government to pay the kilometric guarantee of 16,500 marks per kilometre. Germany is entirely uninfluenced hy political motives m the construction of this railway. She only wishes to reopen an ancient land to civilization, and to unlock fresh doors for trade and industry. That she has any aspirations towards colonization is pure fancy. Although foreign capital must be employed in the construction of the railway, the German character of the undertaking will be always maintained. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) FRANK C.

Block to Foreign Office.—(Received January 31.) 13, My dear Hardinge, Constantinople, January 27, 1908. WITH regard to the Memorandum I sent you concerning the Konia Irrigation scheme, &amp;c., I wish to elucidate two points. 1. It would appear from my Memorandum that the area to he brought under cultivation is only 80,000 deunums. The 80,000 deunums are the area brought under cultivation by the draining of the lake of Karaviran. Besides this, it is expected that by the canalization of the rivers an area of over 500,000 deunums will be brought under cultivation, thus making in all over 580,000 deunums. 2. With regard to the advances made to the Government by the Bank, and stated to be over 50,000,000 fr. (£T. 2,200,000), I find in the last published balance-sheet of the Bank (31st August, 1907) that the Government owes them £ T. 2,080,964. But it must be borne in mind that, according to the Convention between the Bank and the Government, the former is obliged to open a credit account for the latter of £T. 1,000,000. To this I add the £T. 926,230 which the Bank has yet to receive from sums advanced on the security of revenues in the hands of the Debt. The balance, namely £ T. 154,734, are other sums advanced by the Bank to the Civil List, &amp;c., of which I know no details. But the Bank is by no means in any danger on this account, either as regards capital or interest. First to cover the credit account of £ T. 1,000,000, the Government has delivered to the Bank 50,000 bonds of the 1904 4 per cent. Loan, to the nominal value of 1,000,000/. At the rate of to-day this is worth £T. 1,000,000, so that the £ T. 1,000.000 to the credit of the Government is fully covered. ’ Secondly, eventual reimbursement of the sums advanced on the security of the revenues in the hands of the Debt (ceded revenues and “ revenus divers ”) is absolutely assured. There only remains then £T. 154,734, the reimbursement of which may be problematical, but I imagine the Bank has no fears on this account. ^ ^ Again the advances to the Government are at 7 per cent., and the interest also is assured in the first two cases. For the £ T. 1,000,000 by the annuity of £ T. 108,000, which the Public Debt pays as a fixed charge on the surplus of the “ revenus divers.” This £ T. 108,000 is applied as follows :— £ T. Interest, 7 per cent, on £ T. 1,000,000 •• •• •• • * 70,000 Annual subvention paid by Government to bank for the maintenance of Agencies .. .. • • • • • • • • • * 82 ’ 00Q Less the coupon on the 50,000 bonds of the 1904 loan above mentioned in the hands of the Bank, namely .. 152,000 44,000 Total 108,000 and for the sums advanced on the security of revenues, in the hands of idle Debt, there is no fear of the interest not forthcoming. , .. . The Bank then appears to me to he in a sound position, both as regards capital and interest, of at any rate £T. 1,926,230 of its advances, and for the small remainder I am sure the Bank is fully secure. w . . , ... Prom the above, when it is remembered that 7 per cent, is the interest paid by the Government, it is clear that the Bank is doing a profitable business with the Government, and the greater part of its advances may be considered as a very fair investment of a large portion of its paid-up share capital. It is not risking much. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) ADAM BLOCK. [2790 —1]ASIATIC TURKEY. CONFIDENTIAL. [February 3.] Section 2. [3711] (No. 44. Sir, I UYVE the honour to report that a contract was signed on the 25th ultimo between the Anatolian Railway Company and the Minister of Public Works authorizing the doubling of the Company’s present capital, thus raising it to 135,000,000 fr.

I transmit herewith the Conventions relating to these two Concessions, as well as a ^ emoian dum on this development of German enterprise in Asia Minor which Sir Adam Block has forwarded to the Council of Foreign Bondholders in London! It will be noticed that the details of the irrigation scheme differ materially from those previously reported by this Embassy. THREE matters of paramount interest to the country and to German enterprise and finance have recently occurred, concerning which I have deemed it necessarv to obtam information, and which I propose to treat seriatim in this Memorandum. 2. The doubling of the line from Haidar Pasha to Pendik. 3. The doubling of the nominal share capital of the Anatolian Railwav namv. J 1. I annex copy of the Convention between the Ministry of Finance and the Director-General of the Anatolian Railway regarding the irrigation of the Plain of Konia. From the perusal of this Convention it will be seen that works will be undertaken for the canalization of the waters of the Lake of Bey Chehir and the Rivers of Bey Chehir and J charchambar Tchai, and for the draining of the Lake of Karaviran ; o80,000 deunums (about 130,000 acres) of land will be brought under mim vnlirm o 01 19,500,000 fr., to be advanced by the Railway Company. This sum will be repaid in thirty-five years from the date of conclusion of the works; the interest is at the surplus of the “reyetius divers”; (2) the surplus of the tithes revenue of the lands brought under cultivation over and above the average revenue of the last live years; (3) the net receipts from the irrigation works: (GO the net reeeintc I have, &amp;c.

The above are in resume the chief points of the Convention. There is no doubt whatsoever that the result will be beneficial to the country. The area of cultivation to be drained and irrigated is expected to become most fertile. The tithes will increase, population will be attracted thither, and the Railway Company will benefit by a large increase in the traffic receipts. It is essential, however, that the class of peasant to cultivate the lands in question should be the industrious class. Mussulmans from Asia Minor, settled in lands where the harvest one year in three can be expected to give a satisfactory return, will flock to the area now to be irrigated, and if the Government will refrain from establishing on the plain Circassians or Bosnians, who are averse to settled and continuous agricul tural labour, and will establish the laborious and hard-working Moslems from Roumelia, Bulgaria, or Bessarabia, the success of the undertaking is assured. 2. I inclose a copy of the Additional Convention of the Anatolian Railway Concession of the 22nd September, 1304 (1889), regarding the doubling of the line to Pendik. The work will be executed in eighteen months after the approval of the plans. The cost is not to exceed £ T. 100,000, and will bear interest at 5 per cent. This sum, with interest, will be repaid by the Government. The average receipts for the section for ten years will be established, and the increase in gross receipts over and above this sum will not be passed into the receipts of the Haidar-Pasha Ismidt line, but will be devoted to interest and sinking fund of the construction capital to be advanced by the Anatolian Railway Company. Only when the capital is amortized will the increased receipts be passed into the general receipts of the line, and thus reduce the kilometric guarantee. In other words, the Government will pay for the double line, and the advantage will only be reaped when the cost is amortized.* ^ 3. The decision to double the share capital of the Anatolian Railway Company was taken at a general meeting on the 28th June, 1907. This decision was sanctioned by Imperial trade, and entails a modification of Article 6 of the Statutes. The words “ de moitie ” are replaced by the words “ jusqu’a concurrence de 135,000,000 fr.” Article 6 of the Statutes is as follows :—“ Le fonds social est compose du capital a actions ci-apres determine et des obligations a emettre selon le cout des travaux des lignes. Le capital a actions est fixe a 1,800,000/., ou 36,720,000 marks ou 45.000. 000 fr., divise en 90,000 actions de 20/., 408 marks ou 500 fr. chacune. II pourra etre augmente de moitie par I’Assemblee Generale.” As stated above, the words “ de moitie” are replaced by the words “jusqu’a concurrence de 135.000. 000 fr.” The 90,000 shares, viz., nominal capital of 45,000,000 fr., as above mentioned, constitute the capital created in shares of first series, liable, as stated, to be increased by one half, namely, by 22,500,000 fr. In 1893, on the occasion of the construction of the Eski-Ohehir Konia line, of this sum of 22,500,000 fr., there was an issue of a nominal capital of £15,000,000 fr. (representing 30,000 shares) under the denomination of second series. In 1903, at the time of the construction of the Bagdad line, the Anatolian Railway Company issued the remaining balance of the sum of 22,500,000 fr., (namely, 7,500,000 fr.) under the denomination of third series, in order (1) to participate in the Bagdad Concession by a purchase of shares in that Company; (2) to participate in the Haidar Pasha Port Company ; and (3) to take a share in the Construction Company of the Bagdad Railway. Thus the nominal capital of the Anatolian Railway Company, of which the original capital issued was by this time increased by half, was sub-divided follows :— • Until the capital is amortized the amount of the kilometric guarantees to be paid b 3 r the Government from the tithes collected by the Debt Council will be greater than it is to-day (say, by £ T. 9,000 a-year), since the average receipts of ten years are less than what they now are by about that amount. On the other hand, according to Article 8 the Company will reimburse the £ T. 100,000, when the gross receipts of the section to Angora attain 30,000 fr. per kilom.; but when will that be ? X' sw c / v ■J v V ■!Nominal Capital. 90.000 shares of 500 fr., first series ,. 30.000 shares of 500 fr., second series 15.000 shares of 500 lr., third series ,. •• •• •• Fr. 45.000. 000 15.000. 000 7,500,000 Total •• •• •• 67,500,000 ca P^ a l again now doubled by the decision of the general meeting of ^ o 8ti June, 1907, as above stated. Only 00 per cent, of the original nominal capital was called up. It was deemed impossible to call up the remaining 40 per cent, ol the nominal capital without depressing the value of the share, and the General ssembly of the 28th June, 1907, conferred on the Council of Administration all the necessary poueis for the issue and sale of the new shares, or for a call on these new shaies. On the 10th January, 1908, the Deutsche Dank took up the 135,000 shares t0 if ff wl ‘ V created ’ na mely, nominal capital, 67,500,000 fr.; the Deutsche Bank on that date made a first payment to the Anatolian Railway Comjianv of 10 per cent, at par, plus interest at 5 per cent, calculated from the 31st December, 1907, to date of payment. The Deutsche Bank engages itself to pay to the Anatolian Railway Company all jUGnt or benefit which will be realized above 2|- per cent, on the nominal value of the shares until the 10th January, 1918, by the sale of the same shares. It agrees also to reserve for the shareholders of Series I, II, and III a preferential right in the eventual issue of the new shares. »J ri f S f e I)eutsche Bank provides to-day 10 per cent, of 67,500,000 fr., namely, 6,750,000 fr. with interest at 5 per cent, for ten days— Fr. i . + + , 6,750,000 Interest, ten days.. .. .. ^ 9 247 6,759,247 which will be utilized as an instalment for the irrigation works at Konia. . . A ? 1 !iav e before stated, the sum of 19,500,000 fr. will be required for the irrigation works, 2,272,720 fr. for the doubling of the line to Pendik (25 kilom.), and, say, 8,000,000 fr. for the eventual consolidation of the existing line for an express service; but the money will not be required at once. As the works proceed, the Deutsche Bank will put up more money. The total sum required will not, it is believed, exceed 29,772,720 fr. to be spent as above. The shares will be non-transferable shares for the present, and will be distributed only among the Banks belonging to thfe Deutsche Bank Syndicate. Only when 50 per cent, (more than what is required for the present expenditure) of the nominal capital has to be called up will the shares be made transferable and put on the market. . Deutsche Bank group will thus retain a preponderant part of the new share capital. Before concluding this Memorandum, I wish to refer to the recent advance of £ T. 240,000 made to the Government by the Anatolian Railway Company. It is generally believed that the German Government has a promise from the Sultan that the Government’s three-quarter share of the surplus of the ceded revenues belonging to the bondholders shall be reserved for the construction of the Bagdad Railway. The surplus last year was about £T. 500,000; this vear it will be more, £T. 560,000 (Government’s share, say, £ T. 420,000, and after payment of fixed charges, leaving £ T. 280,000 available). In December 1906 Baron Marshall—the French Delegate at the Debt then supported the Germans—would not allow even £ T. 50,000 of this surplus to be pledged as part of the guarantee for the annual payment by the Debt of £ T. 250,000 'for Macedonia in case the Government’s three-quarter share in the product of the 3 per cent, did not suffice for the financial needs of the three vilayets, and in April last year (1907) when the Ottoman Bank advanced £T. 200,000 on the surplus of the ceded re\ enues the Germans did not fail to express their displeasure. The Ottoman Bank, in order to bring pressure to bear on the Turkish Govern ment m the hope that the Government will grant to M. Vitalis and the French group the Heraclea Coal Concession, declines to come to the assistance of the Government inits financial straits ; tlie Germans again rush to the rescue, and the Anatolian Hallway Courpany advances £ T. 240,000 (£. T. 200,000 surplus of the ceded revenues and £ T. 40,000 on Agricultural Bank); it is said that the Germans endeavoured again to obtain a confirmation of the promise that these surpluses would he reserved for the Bagdad Bail way and en attendant that they should only be pledged for temporary advances to the Deutsche Bank. In any case, they probably imposed some conditions which they will endeavour to .enforce when the time comes. £ T. r Jhe surplus of the ceded revenues is pledged to the Ottoman Bank to the amount of .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 676,230 The Germans have now to receive . . .. .. ,. .. 200,000 Total .. .. .. .. .. .. 876,230 Plus interest at 7 per cent. This, in all probability, will not be paid off until ]911, but if any loan operation is undertaken by the Germans for the purpose of the construction of further sections of the Bagdad Bailway secured on the Government’s share in the surplus of the ceded revenues, these advances may be funded or incorporated in such new loan. The Germans have therefore been allowed by the bank to obtain for the first time a material lien on the surplus of the ceded revenues; they will never relinquish it. I question whether the bank has acted wisely. I am told by the Director-General of the Ottoman Bank that the bank has as much as £. T 2,000,000 to receive from various departments of the State. (M. Constans puts the figure at 56,000,000 fr.) This may be so, but, to my knowledge, from the ceded revenues and “ revenus divers ” of the Debt Administration, the Ottoman Bank, apart from fixed assign ments, has still to receive for various advances £T. 926,230 (£T. 676,230 advanced on the security of the surplus of the ceded revenues, and £ T. 250,000 on the security of the surplus of the tithes collected by the Debt Administration, plus interest at 7 per cent.). The Germans, to my knowledge, have to receive from the Government £ T. 830,000, made up as follows :— £ T. Deutsche Bank secured on customs .. .. .. .. .. 300,000 Deutsche Orient Bank secured on the receipts of the military equipment chest.. .. .. .. .. .. .. 300,000 Deutsche Bank (Anatolian Railway Company) secured on the surplus of the coded revenues.. .. .. .. .. .. .. 200,000 £ T. 40,000 on the Agricultural Bank .. .. ,. .. 40,000 Total .. .. .. .. . . .. 840,000 Plus interest at 7 per cent. The Ottoman Bank seems to be somewhat perturbed at seeing the Germans coming again to the assistance of the Government. M. Auboyneau, the Bank Director in Paris, has told me he hoped to reserve the surplus of the ceded revenues for a loan operation, which must come if the Ottoman Government continues its present financial policy, and the Germans have now obtained a lien on the surplus of the ceded revenues. The Turkish Government is far from satisfied with the Ottoman Bank’s policy of restricting their credit in order to obtain a Concession which they would rather not grant; at the same time, the Government are not displeased at seeing the German banks supplanting the Ottoman Bank. It is also evident that the Germans, by easing the strain, have rendered M. Constans’ task of obtaining the Heraclea Coal Concession more ditficult whilst strengthening their hold on the finances of the country, and especially on the surplus of* the ceded revenues. They have in the last few months shown that they intend to prosecute their policy rf financing and developing the country with energy and persistence. When their hold on the surplus revenues of the debt is assured, as it will be, the Germans may take a stronger line in the Debt Administration; and it is consoling at any rate to think that it is most improbable tliat they will tolerate any attempt of the Turkish Government to repudiate their engagements to the bondholders; on the contrary they will strive to extend the control of the Debt Administration. The Trench have the largest holding in the Turkish External Debt, but should tne surplus of the ceded revenues pass into the hands of the Germans they will be equally or more interested in the efficient and untrammelled administration of the ceded[166] I H %Tr%.— ?.

Hardinge on the 22nd instant, and, by direction of the Russian Ambassador, communicated to him the substance of a Confidential letter from M. Isvolsky, on the subject of the Bagdad Railway. Its purport was to the effect that M. Isvolsky had read with interest the account sent him by Count Benckendorff of what had passed between the German Emperor and myself at Windsor, and between Herr von Schon and myself here, relating to the railway. M. Isvolsky was so good as to say that he highly appreciated the attitude assumed by us in the matter, for which he expressed his sincere thanks. As in England and France, there was and could be no sympathy in Russia for the projected construction of the Bagdad Railway. Without mentioning the strategic side of the question, great anxiety was felt in Russia as to the influence which the consequences of the building of the line would have on the actual situation in the Caucasus, Asia Minor, and Persia. It was particularly in the latter country, where a junction of the Bagdad Railway with the future Persian Railways would imply an extension of German commercial interests and competition with existing trade, that alarm for the future was felt. Although England and France had preserved their liberty of action, Russia had not the same position of absolute freedom, since at the beginning of the recent Anglo- Russian negotiations M. Isvolsky had given assurances to Germany that no action would be taken which could in any way prejudice German interests without previous discussion with the German Government. Views had consequently been exchanged between Germany and Russia, with a view to obtaining from Germany guarantees against the extension of German influence in Persia and to overcoming the opposition of Russia to the construction of the railway. From this exchange of views there have been no results. The consequence of my interviews mentioned above was that a new situation had been created, and the Russian Government fully realizing this fact, the question would be carefully considered in all its bearings. The Russian Government appreciated the manner in which His Majesty’s Government had frankly communicated to them their views on the Bagdad Railway, and would not fail to acquaint them, as soon as possible, with the results of the inquiry which was to be made, and “ the friendly attitude of England will certainly exercise a considerable influence on the decision to be taken.” I am, &amp;c.

Yours very truly, (Signed) * DAVID ERASER. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Report on Journey between Constantinople and Eregli made in November 1907 by David Fraser. EROM Haida Pasha to Ismid the track runs along the shores of the Sea of Marmora, which are often precipitous, the land lying in long smooth folds. In order to save construction expenses the line goes round and over these folds with a minimum of cutting and embanking, the result being heavy grades and sharp curves. As far as Ismid there is a good deal of up and down, the highest probably touching 150 feet while the lowest levels are almost flush with the sea. The distance is 91 kilom., and the time taken, exclusive of s'.oppages, was 3 hours 8 minutes; 33 minutes were spent in the fourteen stoppages, making total time between Haidar Pasha and Ismid 3 hours 41 minutes. In event of delay there is provision for augmentation of speed between stations equal to 25 per cent. Roughly, the train I travelled by did 20 miles per hour when moving, and might have accelerated to 25 miles per hour. I think it is very unlikely that this speed could be materially increased owing to the curves and gradients. It seems obvious, and I have heard the opinion expressed with reference to the whole of the Anatolian system, that the high speeds provided for in the Convention for the Bagdad Railway could not be attained without a decree of improvement that would amount to partial reconstruction of &lt;he line between &amp; Haidar Pasha (Constantinople) and Konia. High speed is certainly impossible on many of the curves, as upon many of the gradients, and when this is the case, realigning and additional im p emtive Writing from memory, there is a provision in the B cutting would be [2797 5—1] /- i2 Bagdad Railway Convention,* or possibly in the Anatolian Railway Convention, that additional payments must be made by the Turkish Government to the Bagdad Railwav Company when express services are inaugurated. I was told that the rails are 60 lbs. between Haidar Pasha and Konia, and from Konia to Eregli 80 lbs. On the Anatolian system I understand the Prussian railway methods of construction haie been employed. Throughout the sleepers are hollow, curved, and flat, made of sheet iron or steel, and give the impression of not possessing anything like the hold of the ballast that a wooden sleeper affords. The locking to the sleepers is by fish-plates and bolts, and it is noticeable that on the Bagdad Railway section the bolting is increased, doubtless in view of the greater speed which is expected when this line is established. Throughout the line, except in that part particularized, when the line leaves the littoral and ascends to the plateau of Asia Minor, there seems no liability to washouts or other visitations of nature. Where the heavy ascent occurs there seems sufficient provision against floods, culverts being constructed wherever necessary. I saw nothing to suggest that the railway had ever been damaged by water. I imagine that the rainfall is never of the torrential character which is so prejudicial to Himalayan railways. Rolling stock is Prussian in pattern. The trucks vary in weight and I noticed them marked 7,790, 8,820, 9,070, 9,180 kilom. tare, but all were 15,000 kilom. charge, ?.&lt;?., tn carry 15 tons, both closed and open. Each was marked to carry forty men, with surface 18 3 metres and volume 37 3 metres—that is the closed trucks. Engines are big and powerful, and some are Erench in make. Others I am told were made in America, England, Germany, &amp;c. My train consisted of 1 engine, 8 wagons (4 metres between axles), 1 guard s van (6 metres between axles), 4 small passenger coaches, and 1 double bogie, with total length of nearly 200 yards. It was noticeable that the sidings were often too short to accommodate so long a train. This defect is rectified in the Bagdad section when sidings are always about 400 yards long. Our engine seemed quite equal to its work even on heavy gradients. The trucks, however, were all empty so far as I could tell. Except at three points it would appear to be almost impossible seriously to damage the railway, as the bridges are few and small and close to the water. At the three points referred to there are high bridges (described in notes on Guebzeh, Biledjik,' and Yaila), any one of which being broken would throw the line out of work for months. Trans-Shipment over a breakage, however, could be easily effected at these points. In considering contingencies in this respect in time of w T ar it must not be overlooked that junction with the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway at Afion-Kara-Hissar is at any moment possible. The elevations shown in the time-table attached show the transit from the low country to the plateau of Asia Minor. Once this is attained the railway is practically dead-level, and without curves that would prevent high speed. The line runs alone f n ^terminable plain from Tche Kurler to Eregli, at a height varying little from 3,200 feet above sea-level. The surrounding country is cultivated in a minor decree wheat being grown in large quantity. That the output might be multiplied many times is obvious, for only patches are cultivated in large stretches of land of exactly the same character. Frequently land that has been ploughed within a few years is seen to be allowed to he fallow. Since the opening of the railway there has been a very large increase in the wheat production, as there now exists a market and a means of transport that formerly was absent. Only a beginning has been made, however, and the future should see a remarkable development. The obstacles to immediate expansion are three. Misgovernment has prevented the peasant cultivating more mn enough to furnish fool for his family, as any surplus was squeezed from him by o cials. Ibis, on the line of railway, is now T seldom possible owing to closer super vision on the part of the Government, and because the increase in tithes which increased cultivation brings causes the Government to co-operate with the railway in the endeavour to promote development. An obstacle that remains, and which will a e ime to surmount is the indolence of the peasant, who has no ambition beyond t e mmediate needs of his belly. To work hard to-day that he may have money for o-morrow is unnecessary on the part of an individual who believes that his future lies entirely in the hands of God. The grand difficulty, however, is the fact that the of 700,€00 fr for' the Anatohin 01 ^' 1 ?^ 011 P ro T^ es ^ or a ca pbal expenditure of 8,000,000 fr., and an annuity exact terms. ’ Anatolia n Ra-lway, to improve the line to bear express traffic.

(1.) Bostandjik. — Immediately east of station is iron bridge, single span, about 30 feet, 8 feet above small stream. Twenty yards down stream is small stone bridge for local traffic, massive, might be used in case of damage if strengthened. (2.) Pendik to Touzla. —About 2 kilom. west of Pendik is iron bridge, single span, about 30 yards, 10 feet above small river. Immediately down stream is three-span stone bridge for local traffic, very narrow and humped, useless as railway bridge in emergency At Touzla saw number of wooden huts, apparently empty, looked like summer barracks, probably accommodate 1,000-2,000 men. (3.) Guebzeh. —1 kilom. beyond railway crosses deep ravine, apparently 70 or 80 feet down, a few yards away are five slender stone piers 35 to 40 yards apart, recently abandoned for present iron bridge, nature of which couhl not see, but length is about 200 yards, break here would be very serious as quick deviation practically impossible owing to depth and rocky ground. Failing iron-work for bridge, would be neces ary circle top of ravine, crossing stiff folds, entailing perhaps a mile of construction, much cutting and embanking, and high grading. (4.) Dil Iskelessi. —300 yards east is iron bridge, single span, 30 yards, 6 feet above water, over deep creek. (5.) Zte/wye.—Besides two open sidings, there are three blank loading sidings, on to a coal depot, also line, to a wi arf 300 yards distant, where a steamer of 1,000 tons was berthed, and where a big factory. (6.) Ismid, —About eight sidings, nearly all double ended; observed no loading sheds, engine house to hold four or six, turntable. (7.) Hamidie.—Rcre is branch line running to Ada Bazaar, 8| kilom. north. Large stock of wood planks. Small loading shed. Hitherto railway has traversed magnificent alluvial plain from Ismid, but now enters mountainous country— vide heights. In narrow valley are three bridges— Two-span iron, one stone pier, 30 yards long, 6 feet above small stream. &gt;» 80—100 yards long, 25 feet above river. One-span iron, 20 yards long, 10 feet above small stream. Continuing through fine gorge, where hillsides heavily wooded with small trees. Approaching Gueve opens out, cultivation in flats and in hillsides. River recrossed by bridges 100 yards long, two span,^20 feet above water. Just before reaching Gueve 60-foot bridge, single span, 6 feet above water. (8 ) Gueve. —Large goods shed, with open sides, accommodate about six waggons. From Gueve to Mekedie fine alluvial plain, 26 kilom. long. J (9.) Mekedje. Railway now enters another fine gorge, where river threatens track, and has been heavily embanked with stone, and breakwaters thrown out. River crossed by two-span iron bridges, 100 yards long, 20 feet above water. After 4 or 5 kilom. enters another big valley; half-a-mde from Lef ke crosses river bridge 150 yards, two stone piers, 30 feet above water. o , S l0 'l Vesi i ^ ra/2 *— Between Lefk e and Vesir-Han, bridge, two-span, 40 yards long, 15 feet above water, i om. beyond is another bridge, one-span, 20 yards long, 20 feet above water. Railway now in very narrowgoige, with mountains rising 500 to 1,000 feet on either side, varying between 50 and 80 broad. Most remarkable place, as following shows; 2 kilom. beyond first bridge there come:— Bridge, single-span, 20 yards long, 20 feet above water. v &gt;i 60 to 90 feet long, 20 feet above water. „ „ 60 to 90 „ 20 „ „ 60 to 90 „ 20 „ „ „ 60 to 90 „ 20 Tunnel, 100 yards long. Bridge, single-span, 60 to 90 feet long, 20 feet above water. „ „ 60 to 90 „ 20 v „ 60 to 90 „ 20 „ „ „ 60 to 90 „ 20 „ Engineering, cutting, embanking, &amp;c., very heavy. (IL) Biledjik. Engine-house for four, turntable, also two blank sidings. Out of Biledjik the line makes a remarkable ascent, speed places being reduced to 6 to 8 miles an hour. From Biledjik to Karakeuy is 16-8 kilom., distance^ which takes seventy minutes to compass, ascent being 323 metres, giving an average gradient of 1 in 50. Soon after Biledjik is iron bridge, on s x stone piers, 180 yards long, about 60' feet above (notes omit to say whether above river or ravine—latter I think). Then follow immediately two tunnels, totalhr^ aboiit 150 yards in length. Then, about 3 kilom. from station, wonderful view of town and river in valley beneath. Here comts big iron girder bridge over ravine, 100 yards long, 90 feet above bottom ravine. Could not see nature of supports, but seemed to be girders striking sideways out of slopes. Ravine falls right down on one side, and on other rocky ground ascends high up. Deviation would be extremely difficult business. (12.) Yaila. Four hundred yards past station is another bridge, similar to previous one, 120 yards long, 80 feet deep, over ravine. Followed by tunnels of 350 yards, 110 yards, 360 yards, 90 yards, 200 yards, 200 yards, 160 yards, 100 yards, 200 yards, or nine tunnels, aggregating very nearly 1 mile. Between Bilediik and Karakeuy there is a road following the bottom ot the gorge ; looks good, about 12 feet broad, and \vell graded, rough in places, but rocky floor, and could stand heavy traffic, so far as could be judged from the railway, which runs high up on the side of the gorge. (13 ) Afion-Kara Hissar .—Considerable shed accommodation, engine-house for six, two turntables. Heie is junction with Smyrna—Cassaba Railway. Ihe stations are half-a-mile apart, and are joined by a track , which, however, has been torn up for some distance. Junction could be effected in a few hours.

Extract from the “ Times” of January 6, 1908. German Kairways in Asia Minor. ON the 23rd instant a contract was signed by the representatives of the Government and of the Anatolian Railway Company, by which the latter is authorized to double its share capital, at present amounting to 67,500,000 fr. (2,700,000/.) nominal. This important increase has been decided on as the simplest method of providing the capital necessary for certain costly undertakings upon which the Company is shortly to embark. Of the existing share capital only 60 per cent, has been paid up, and the expediency of calling in the outstanding balance was considered, but the idea was abandoned as being liable to prejudice holders by forcing many who could not meet the call to part with their shares. At a meeting of the Board of the Anatolian Railway and Deutsche Bank on Saturday last it was decided that the Deutsche Bank should take over all the newly created stock and subscribe immediately only 10 per cent., undertaking to meet further calls gradually, according to the needs of the Railway Company. These needs thus provided for are— First, the cost of doubling the line from Haidar-pasha to Pendik, a distance of about 50 kilom.; Secondly, the capital required for the Koniah irrigation works; and Thirdly, the cost of improving and strengthening the Anatolian line to permit the running of an express service in connection with the Bagdad Railway. The first of these undertakings will entail an expense of about 3,000,000 fr. (120,000/.), on which the Government have already guaranteed 5 per cent interest to be derived from the excess receipts of the suburban line over the average receipts of the last ten years. The second scheme will consume 20,000,000 fr (800 000/) to which another 2,000,000 fr. (80,000/.) must be reckoned as interest until completion of the work. The special guarantees for this outlay have already been described • the Government guarantees a minimum of 5 per cent. In the third matter the Company is bound by the Bagdad Railway Convention to spend a minimum of 8 000 GOO fr (320,000/.) on the repair and improvement of the Baidar-pasha-Koniah andEskishehr- Angora lines, to permit the running of express trains; a sum of 350 000 fr. (14 000/ ^ from the surplus of tithes affected to the kilometric guarantees of the line will be paid to meet the interest and sinking fund on the sum of the disbursements under this head Incidentally it may be mentioned that the Government undertakes to provide an eauai sum of 3o0,000 fr. to meet the special loss on the express service, which, however onlv begins when the line has reached Aleppo. . Finally, the Company anticipates spending some money on the renewal of a part of its rolling-stock and the acquisition o/sundry other matenals, which it has hitherto been unwilling or unable to afford. Althouo-h the Government guarantees only 5 per cent, on two of these undertakings, the Company is on^bare^ ^ ^ lmproved returns Wl11 enable it to maintain a dividend of 5 per cent.
