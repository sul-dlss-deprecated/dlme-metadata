Orders have gone forward from Messrs Khali1 bin Ebrahim Kanoo, Muhummad Saleh Shuttar, Abulkader Abdulaly Khutumbawalla, Abed al Yemny.

Sir, To The Secretary to the Han'hie the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, Bushire. ■ yft With reference to your letter No»2096 dated the 12th September 1929, I have the honour to inform you that during the last five years the local trade of mother-of- pearl shell has been very insignificant. I understand in 1924 ivo local firms, the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Ltd., and Abdul Aziz Khunji purchased large quantities of small Lingeh shells. In that year the former sorted their stares and exported to Hamburg. In 1927-28 the latter sorted their stores and exported to Hamburg per steamer of Hansa Line. It is state^tiiat ti^ ventures proved unsuccessful, the diells being two small \ for the importers requirements. The larger type of shells ( bold and medium) are found in Bahrein in a very small qnantity but I am informed, could be obtained if required. In my opinion the best local firms for Messrs M. Myers to approach would be 1. Mess the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited 2. Messrs Bhamanmal Isardas &amp; Co. The latter is a firm of Indian bankers and general merchants. They also deal in pearls and are closely in touch with the pearling industry and bear a good reputation for integrity in their dealings.

I would be glad ii you -ould put me into touch, via the Department of Overseas Trade, of makers of such engines in England, so that I may reccmrnend t^eir use in launches in preference to American engines, -he launch engine market is at present entirely British and it is our dirty 'to sgg ■that it* remains so.

MEMORANDUM : - ' Conformably with your request, I have shewn to the leading local piece-goods merchants the samples of British piece-goods issued by: 1. Messrs Priestleys Limited. 2. Messrs J. Cawthra &amp; Co. Ltd., 3. Messrs A. Scott &amp; Co., (a) (b) (c) (d) To summarise the opinions expressed, I would remark: The goods are good goods, the quality being '^irst-class , and the prices being cheap and competitive. The materials are most suitable for the summer climate of Iraq or the winter climate of Bahrein. It will be remembered that'British people, generally, dress more warmly than others. The local winter market is chiefly in cashmeres and merinos, so thase materials are strange to it. Consequently local tradesmen are timid of locking up their money in strange materials until they are certain of a sale for same. This is the wrong time of the year to order, in any case. It is necessary that winter orders for Bahrein should be placed by the beginning of August, at least. Messrs Abbasbkal Hatimbhai &amp; Co. , remembering the promise of the sale of a suit-length each to Yourself, Dr Holmes, and myself, ask that an order may go forward to Messrs Priestleys Limited for One piece of 0.9567 Tropical Suiting design No.l., and One piece ' ' ' ' ' No.5. only upon the stated terms, except that they will pay cash against documents at the Eastern Bank Ltd, Bahrein, less 2&gt;fi discount on sight., not cash against documents etc. , in London. These terms are locally customary and reasonable, and I recommend their acceptance. This firm also is interested in No.0.9605 for the Bahrein market. I would venture to suggest that each of the above manu facturers should be advised to despatch their patterns, prices etc., to (1) Messrs Abbasbhai Katimbhai &amp; Co., (2) Hajy Ibrahim l.uhunmad Aly, (3) Hafiz Khanbhai Mulla Abdulaly, (4) Jamanamal Asarunal &amp; Co. to arrive here in July, shewing a c.i.f.Bahrein price, with an attractive discount for cash against documents on sight at Bahrein. I believe that if shipments from England are made by the .jtric-k Line the freight rates are cheap, and the danger of pilferage m trans is avoided. If Messrs Abbasbhai Eatimbhai submit to the above firms samples of the piece-goods most saleable in Bahrein at present, would these firms quote for the supply of thesemate rials . , / / / OF and IT-OFFICER.

The attached Memorandum has been prepared, as in previous years, tor the purpose of giving information respecting the Fair, together with general instruc tions, to His Majesty's Trade Commissioners, Commercial Diplomatic Officers, Consular Officers and Imperial Trade Correspondents. E. F. CROWE. Department of Overseas Trade. 10th August, 1929. Note. —This circular memorandum has been sent in duplicate to: (1) H.M, Representatives for information, with extra copies for communication to Commercial Diplomatic Officers and Superintending Consular Officers. (2) Usual outlying posts. (3) H.M. Trade Commissioners. (4) Certain Imperial Trade Correspondents. MEMORANDUM. I.— Date and site. 1. The Fair, the 16th of the series, will be held from the 17th to the 28th February, inclusive, at Olympia, London, and Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. The former section will be organised by the Department of Overseas Trade, and the latter by the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce under the auspices of the Department. The sections are complementary to one another, the whole forming the British Industries Fair. A schedule is sub-joined showing the allocation of the trades to the London and Birmingham sections. II.— Growth of the Fair. 2. All previous records were broken at the 1929 Fair, the number of exhibitors being 2,438, and the space occupied 530,000 square feet (net)—320,000 square feet in London and 210,000 square feet in Birmingham. The correspond ing figures for 1928 were 2,123 exhibitors, occupying 434,000 square feet of space.. The attendance of buyers from home and abroad was also a record one in 1929. III.— New buildings for the London Fair. 3. The London section of the Fair, which is organised by the Department of Overseas Trade, will be held for the first time in its new home at Olympia, which is being specially enlarged for the purpose by the addition of a new four- storey building. The new building will not be completed until the 1931 Fair, but two floors will be ready for occupation by February next, and, by means of bridging the galleries of the existing buildings and other reconstruction work, there will be ready for the coming Fair a large two-storey exhibition building, which is believed to be the first of its size and kind in the country. 4. Owing to the impossibility of completing the new building in time, the available space next February will be less than that occupied at White City in February of this year—260,000 square feet as compared with 320,000—but the advantages of moving at once to the new site are considered by the Depart ment and by its advisory committee of exhibitors to outweigh the reduction of space, which, moreover, will be only for the one year. In 1931, when the four- storey building is complete, there will be as much space as was used at the White City, and ample provision can be made in subsequent years for the expected steady growth of the Fair.5. The chief advantages of the new home of the London section are that the buildings are extremely suitable and convenient; they are compact in arrange ment so as to bring all sections into close touch with one another; and there will be three main entrances so as to give easy access to every section. These are improvements which will make the work of the trade buyers easier than in the past. 6. Moreover, the buildings are suitable for use at any time of the year. The heating and ventilation consequently leave little to be desired, and the existence of a permanent catering organisation, working with all the equipment and facilities of a first-class restaurant, will obviate the necessity for improvising kitchens and restaurants for a fortnight each year, a task impossible of satis factory accomplishment. IV.— A dvertising appropriation. 7. His Majesty's Government have again granted the sum of £25,000 for expenditure on publicity. A statement is attached showing the allocation of this amount as decided by the Department after consultaion with the Joint General Purposes and Publicity Committee. 8. As the overseas officers concerned will be aware from a circular despatch which was addressed to them on the 9th July, it has been decided that they should be allowed to expend at their own discretion the sums allocated for publicity in their respective countries, provided they are willing to undertake this responsibility, and subject to the Department's approving their schemes. V.— Press and General Publicity. 9. Messrs. Charles F. Higham, Limited; have again been appointed as the Department's agents for the placing of press advertising in this country. They will not deal with the placing of advertisements in the overseas press except in cases where the overseas officers are not prepared to undertake the expenditure of the sums allotted. 10. As in previous years, the Department will endeavour to arrange for the issue of special articles descriptive of individual sections of the Fair, or certain aspects of British industry, with special reference to the Fair. Such articles will, as far as possible, be translated into the languages of the countries in which the overseas officers reside. 11. Arrangements will also be made to publish in the Board of Trade Journal a series of articles on the Fair, giving the latest information available, and it is hoped that overseas officers will be able to arrange for the reproduction of some of this matter in the local press. Arrangements will also again be made with the News Department of the Foreign Office for the inclusion of information regarding the Fair in their weekly bulletins and wireless news. VI.— Publicity literature. 12. The literature available will consist of a folder and a showcard, and an adhesive poster stamp. Copies of the folder translated into French, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Danish, and Swedish, of the showcard and of the invitation card will be forwarded to overseas officers in due course. It is suggested that the poster stamp should be used on outgoing correspondence by officers and, where possible, by local British firms, Chambers of Commerce, etc. It is found advisable as a general rule to affix the stamp to the letter, and not to the envelope since, in many business houses, the envelopes are opened by the junior staff and are not seen by the heads of firms at all. 13. It is suggested that copies of the showcard and of the folder should, as before, be distributed to local British banks, railway, shipping and insurance ■companies, to British Chambers of Commerce, and to local branches of British firms. It is hoped that it may be possible also to induce British firms to assist to circulate the folder. The Department has again approached headquarters in this country of the companies concerned, with the request that they should notify3 managers of their overseas branches to place themselves in touch with overseas officers with a view to assisting in making the Fair widely known. It is suggested that British tourist agencies, British and foreign hotels, clubs, etc., might be asked to co-operate. 14. It is proposed to supply 10,000 advance copies of the catalogue of the London section of the Fair with a printed inset of Birmingham exhibitors. It is intended to issue this catalogue at the beginning of the New Year to those officers whom supplies can reach in time for distribution before buyers leave for England, i.e., countries within three weeks' journey of the United Kingdom. Any such officers who have not previously notified the Department that they could make use of the advance catalogue are requested to do so without delay. It is suggested that copies of the advance catalogue accompanied by a covering letter should be sent to those buyers who are known to have visited the last Fair, as well as to other important firms. The advance catalogues may, however, be useful in far distant countries for publicity and reference purposes, even if received too late to be of use to intending visitors, and officers who desire to have copies should notify the Department. VII.— Direct apyeal to buyers, 15. The value of the special propaganda undertaken by overseas officers in inducing buyers to visit the Fair is yielding increasingly satisfactory results year by year, and it is desired that these special efforts may be renewed and varied. In most countries the departmental stores are large buyers of products at the Fair : special attention should, therefore, be directed to them. At the same time officers will be aware of other important buyers of the particular classes of goods included in the London and Birmingham trade schedules. In this con nection the increasing importance of the Engineering Section at Birmingham and of the Textile Section in London should be borne in mind. It is suggested that those firms who cannot arrange to send buyers to England for the Fair might be persuaded to instruct agents in this country to visit the Fair on their behalf. 16. The campaign of direct appeal to buyers from London will be continued as usual, and will again take the form this year of three special letters, each in the language of the recipient, which will issue to those buyers whose names appear on the British Industries Fair Index. The first letter will be signed by the Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade, and subsequent letters probably by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department and the President of the Board of Trade. The third letter will contain general informa tion regarding the Fair and a card of invitation. VIII.— Grant of gratis visas. 17. Arrangements have again been made in cases where buyers require visas for overseas officers to be authorised to grant gratis visas on passports of k ' bona fide ' buyers visiting the Fair. The necessary instructions to Consular Officers and Passport Control Officers will be issued in due course.4 SCHEDULE OF EXHIBITS. London. Organised by the Department of Overseas Trade.

The chief advantage of the sealed Cell in hot climates is the fact that the lid prevents loss of Electrolyte, which usually results from evaporation, and consequently saves a considerable amount of time, trouble, and cost of distilled water, which is normally required for topping Gells of the open pattern, to replace the loss due to evaporation. We shall be very pleased to receive enquiries giving details of the number of lights it is intended to install, and if possible, the wattage of the lamps, and the length of time for which all of the lights will be burning daily. It is also necessary for the voltage to be specified., ELECTRICAL STORAGE COMPANY LIMITED. 2. The Gonsul-General. 10.9.29. We shall be very pleased to give any further information that is desired.

(• * U K \&lt;S&gt; f O ^ &lt; In reference to my memorandum of 23rd November, on the subject of British-made suitings for the Bahrein market, I hear thw; Mr Abdul Hamid, son of K.B .Muhummad Sharif, who has just returned from an European tour,has brought back to Bahrein some very interesting samples of German-made suitings, no doubt for commercial purposes here, I have no particulars of the prices etc. , but from my knowledge of local imports, I should suppose that a German-made cloth would sell here cheaper than an English-made suiting. PORT OFFICER. BAHREIN. ■ H.B.M's Political Agent, BAHREIN: MEMORANDUM:-[Reference: 33496/1930.] CONFIDENTIAL. Overseas Trade Circular. BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR, 1931 The attached Memorandum has been prepared, as in previous years, for the purpose of giving information respecting the Fair, together with general instructions, to His Majesty's Trade Commissioners, Commercial Diplomatic Officers, Consular Officers and Imperial Trade Correspondents. Note. —This circular raeniorandum has been sent in duplicate to:— (1) H.M. Representatives for information, with extra copies for communication to Commercial Diplomatic Officers and Superintending Consular Officers. (2) Usual outlying posts. (3) H.M. Trade Commissioners. (4) Certain Imperial Trade Correspondents. I.— Date and site. 1. The Fair, the 17th of the series, will be held from the 16th to the 27th February, inclusive, at Olympia, London, and Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. The former section will be organised by the Department of Overseas Trade, and the latter by the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce under the auspices of the Department. The sections are complementary to one another, the whole forming the British Industries Fair. A schedule is sub-joined showing the allocation of the trades to the London and Birmingham sections. II.— Growth of the Fair. 2. As explained in Overseas Trade Circular (Ref. 33500/29) of the 10th August, 1929, the transfer of the London Section of the Fair to Olympia last February necessitated a reduction in its size, as only some 260,000 square feet were available at Olympia as compared with 320,000 square feet occupied by the London Section of the 1929 Fair at the White City. For the 1931 Fair, however, the remaining two floors of the new Empire Hall will be ready tor occupation, thereby increasing the exhibiting space available to some 300,000 square feet. The area occupied by the Birmingham Section of the 1930 Fair was 200,000 square feet under cover and 13,000 square feet in the grounds. There were about 2,000 exhibitors in all (London and Birmingham). 3. The attendances at the 1929 and 1930 Fairs were as follows— E. F. CROWE. Department of Overseas Trade. ^^August, 1930.

The number of overseas buyers showed an increase of over 20 per cent, as compared with the previous year. Seventy countries were represented, made up as follows :— A comparison of the numbers from the different countries shows that Hol land, as usual, headed the list, with Canada and the United States second and third respectively; Australia was fourth, Germany fifth, and the countries then ran in the following order :—France, India, Belgium, S. Africa, New Zealand, Switzerland, Argentine, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Japan, Austria, Spain, Norway, Poland, China, Czecho-Slovakia, Ceylon. III.— New 'buildings for the London Fair. 5. The London section of the Fair, which is organised by the Department of Overseas Trade, will again be held at Olympia, which is being further enlarged by the addition of two more floors to the new Empire Building. As pointed out in a previous circular, the chief advantages of the new home of the London section are that the buildings are extremely suitable and convenient; they are compact in arrangement so as to bring all sections into close touch with one another; and three main entrances give easy access to every sec tion. These are improvements which make the work of thie trade buyers easier than in the past. Moreover, the buildings are suitable for use at any time of the year. The heating and ventilation leave nothing to be desired, and the existence of a permanent catering organisation, working with all the equipment and facilities of a first-class restaurant, will obviate the necessity for improvis ing kitchens and restaurants for a fortnight each year, a task impossible of satisfactory accomplishment. IV.— Advertising appropriation. 6. His Majesty's Government have again granted the sum of £25,000 for expenditure on publicity. A statement is attached showing the allocation of this amount as decided by the Department after consultation with the Joint General Purposes and Publicity Committee. 7. As the overseas officers concerned will be aware from despatches which have been addressed to them, it has been decided that they should be allowed to expend at their own discretion the sums allocated for publicity in their respec tive countries, provided they are willing to undertake this responsibility, and subject to the Department's approval of their schemes. V.— Fress and General Publicity. 8. Messrs. Charles F. Higham Limited have again been appointed as the Department's agents for the placing of press advertising in this country. They will not deal with the placing of advertisements in the overseas press except in cases where the overseas officers are not prepared to undertake the expenditure of the sums allotted. 9. As in previous years, the Department will endeavour to arrange for the issue of special articles descriptive of individual sections of the Fair, or certain aspects of British industry, with special reference to the Fair. Such articles will, as far as possible, be translated into the languages of the countries in which the overseas officers reside. IX). Arrangements will also be made to publish in the Board of Trade Jour nal a series of articles on the Fair, giving the latest information available, and Countries. Dominions and Colonies Europe North, Central and South America ... Near and Far East Africa (excluding British territories) 18 26 13 8 5 703 it is hoped that overseas officers will be able to arrange for the reproduction of some of this matter in the local press. Arrangements will also again be made with the News Department of the Foreign Office for the inclusion of informa tion regarding the Fair in their weekly bulletins and wireless news. 11. In this connection it would be very helpful if overseas officers would give some indication of subjects on which special articles dealing with particular branches of British industry— not necessarily directly relating to the forth coming Fair— would be most acceptable in their respective countries. It has been suggested that articles specially prepared with reference to the conditions of a particular country, and relating to a British industry for whose products there is a substantial or potential demand in that country, would be more likely to arouse interest than articles of a more general character written without reference to any particular market. It is felt that if overseas officers will co operate in indicating subjects for articles of this character and in arranging for their publication in suitable journals, valuable propaganda for British in dustry may be effected without undue expense. Officers will of course exercise their discretion as to how far the placing of paid advertisements is desirable in the journals to which these articles are offered. 12. The following extract from a despatch from H.M. Senior Trade Com missioner in Australia, is of interest as indicating another means of securing publicity for the Fair which may commend itself to overseas officers in other countries as opportunities arise : ' At the recent Agricultural Show held at Sydney from April 17th to 25th, the local representative of the Leipzig Fair had a special stall in a prominent position in the main Hall of Manufactures. ' The stall, which was about 10 feet wide and about 12 to 15 feet in depth, was surmounted by a large notice, ' Visit the Leipzig Fair,' and was devoted entirely to advertising the advantages of visiting the Fair. It was well supplied with pamphlets, which were being distributed freely to passing visitors. To anyone stopping and expressing more than merely a passing interest, the advantages of paying a visit to the Leipzig Fair were explained in detail and a note made of their name and address for future reference.' VI.— Publicity literature. 13. The literature available will consist of a folder and a showcard, and an adhesive poster stamp. Copies of the folder translated into French, Ger man, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Danish, and Swedish, of the show- card and of the invitation card will be forwarded to overseas officers in due course. It is suggested that the poster stamp should be used on outgoing corres pondence by officers and, where possible, by local British firms. Chambers of Commerce, etc. It is found advisable as a general rule to affix the stamp to the letter, and not to the envelope since, in many business houses, the envelopes are opened by the junior staff and are not seen by the heads of firms at all. 14. It is suggested that copies of the showcard and of the folder should, as before, be distributed to local British banks, railway, shipping and insurance companies, to British Chambers of Commerce, and to local branches of British firms. It is hoped that it may be possible also to induce British firms to assist to circulate the folder. The Department has again approached headquarters in this country of the companies concerned, with the request that they should notify managers of their overseas branches to co-operate with overseas officers in making the Fair known. It is suggested that British tourists agencies, hotels, and clubs, etc., might also be asked to co-operate. 15. It is proposed to print 10,000 advance copies of the catalogue of the Fair and to issue them at the beginning of the new year to those officers whom supplies can reach in time for distribution before buyers leave for England, i.e., countries within three weeks' journey of the United Kingdom. Any such officers who have not previously notified the Department that they could make use of the advance catalogues are requested to do so without delay. It is suggested that copies of the advance catalogues accompanied by a covering letter should be sent to those buyers who are known to have visited the last Fair, as well as to other important firms.4 The advance catalogues may, however, be useful in far distant countries for publicity and reference purposes, even if received too late to be of use to intend ing visitors, and officers who desire to have copies should notify the Department. VII.— Direct appeal to buyers. 16. The value of the special propaganda undertaken by overseas officers in inducing buyers to visit the Fair is yielding increasingly satisfactory results year by year, and it is desired that these special efforts may be renewed and varied. In most countries the departmental stores are large buyers of products at the Fair : special attention should, therefore, be directed to them. At the same time officers will be aware of other important buyers of the particular classes of goods included in the London and Birmingham trade schedules. It is suggested that those firms who cannot arrange to send buyers to England for the Fair might be persuaded to instruct agents in this country to visit the Fair on their behalf. 17. The campaign of direct appeal to buyers from London will be con tinued as usual, and will take the form this year of five special letters, each in the language of the recipient, which will issue to those buyers whose names appear on the British Industries Fair Index. The first letter will be signed by the Secretary of the Fair and subsequent letters by the Comptroller-General oi the Department of Overseas Trade, the President of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department. The last letter will contain a card of invitation to the Fair. VIII.— Grant of gratis visas. 18. Arrangements have again been made in cases where buyers require visas for overseas officers to be authorised to grant gratis visas on passports of ' bona fide ' buyers visiting the Fair. The necessary instructions to Consular Officers and Passport Control Officers will be issued in due course.® l 0( i 5 SCHEDULE OF EXHIBITS. London, Organised by the Department of Overseas Trade.

It is, indeed, difficult to cope with our agisting coixiorical work and the^ annual trade report was published eighteen nonths in arrears this year and was only got ready then vrtth the greatest difficulty, 3o As the Government of India are not likely to consider the appointment of an Assistant Political Agent, I suggest that tho Vice Consul at Bushire, who is familiar with these problems and has the leisure to pursue them, should be detailed to make a toir once or twico a year and familiarise hlmcelf with tne situation and collect samples, leaving it to the Agency to reply to definite points as they were raised, What I particularly a.uir, to avoid, and cannot und«rtaJc« to j work •^iafactorily, la a Hoat of s.t foma and constant r«fsransta i-rom th» D#partia«nt 'overaeas Trad#, moat of than probably quit, inapplioabl, to Bahrain, which would involv, US(ii) us An duties which w« haT« n«ith«r tin staff or training to carry out* 4, I Tantura to dram tho attention of the Hon'lole the Political Resident to the fact that the expenses of the Bahrein Agency are not diTisihle with the Imperial Government and that the coromerical interests, (particularly those mentioned in Suhsections I and 2 of para I of tho first enclosure to your letter under reply) are likely to be ones which complete with Indian producers.

British Residency &amp; Ocnsulate-G-eneral ^ Bushire, the 3r(l January 1931® Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge tne receipt cf your despatch No .Fo7445/30, enclosing a inemcrandum from the Department of Overseas Trade relating to the preparation of reports on Trade on the Arah Ocast cf the Persian Gulf 'by the officers in this area© 2o On the receipt cf the Department of Overseas Trade's despatch Nc.33599/21/1930 cf August 14th, I requested the Political Agents at Kuwait, Bahrein and Muscat to furnish me with their views on the subject. These only reached me shortly before my departure on tour at the end of October and L^therefore considered it preferable to defer an expression of my views until I had had an opportunity of discussing the matter with them. I observe that the Department cf Overseas Trade have now decided to furnish me with directicns for the collection of information on the Trades originally suggested i.e. (1) Cotton Piece-G-cods (2) Silks and Artificial Silks and 13) Motor vehicles. 3o As a result cf my own observation and dis cussion with the officers concerned while on tour, I have the honour to put forward the following points with regard to the Trades chosen and questions connected with the execution cf the work entailed. The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, LONDON.2 li 0 4?* Of the trades ciicsen, Nc.l would seem to offer the most promising field for investigation. Ootton goods consitiite 'by far the most important import of manufactured goods, and is one in which the British position is being seriously attacked by strong Japanese competition. The total annual value of this trade in Kuwait, Bahrein, Dihai and Muscat normally amounts to some £,4,00,000. How this is shared among the principal competitors is hard to say, since almost the whole (in Kuwait a considerable proportion is imported from •Iraq.) is imported through India and is shown as of Indian origin in Customs figures, hut there is little doubt that, wnereas formerly a large pro-y portion of the imports were of -British origin, they are now most definitely Japanese, which country's entry into the market, at any rate as regards Cotton prints, appears to he of very recent date. extent pieces of striped silk of suitable size for similar use, are displayed in the hazaars. handkerchiefs as such are scarcely, if indeed ever, used-certainly only 'by a very restricted section of the community. Artificial silks, in the piece seems to he gaining popularity and are used for dress^hy women of the more well-to-do classes. Japan and Italy appear to be the principal sources of supply, the former very definitely preponderating; no Italian silk or artificial silk being seen in 'bazaars south of Bahrein. u n the whole inferior silks from China and Japan seem more favoured, since they compete with the former in price. The total value of the siiks and artificial silks imported in the whole area concerned prohahly As regards No.2 the market affordsiittle scope. Head cloths of cotton or wool (imported through, or more ofWten manufacturedprobably dees net exoeed £.50,000 annually. With regard te the abeve ebservatlens the attached meineranduni and samples inay preve cT in«* terest. As regards Ne.3 openings are practically nen-existent and the very limited demand is met by cars of the Pord and Chevrolet type — only cars cf tais price and pwwer could be expected to find a market. Reads, however, are being opened up in Muscat and this is leading to a small demand Tor cars thore tneugh the unprecendented depression in the pearl jnarket is of course retarding decelopment. What would appear to offer a far more promising field is the marine engine market, in which Kelvin and Thornycroft at present held a vlrtualy monopoly. The demand is for engines of 50 tc 100 h.pc for use in the dhows of pearl dealers who go out to the diving banks te effect their purchases, and in launches belonging to merchants. The demand is growing steadily : ' the dimple, reli able engines manufactured by tne above makers are ax- exactly what are required and aai I trust that they 1 will spare no effort te maintain their position, to popularise the use cf auxiliary motors in dhows and to extend their trade. As regards the question of obtaining trade information regular/ly from the Arab Coast, I shall be glad to transmit any questionnaires that I may receive from the Department of Overseas Trade to th^ Political Agents and to collate their replies\ It doubtful whether the Political Agent, Bahrein, who x nowadays very hard worked will be able to devote L .ach time personally to such enquiries, but the Director of Customs is an Englishman and, of course, in close touch with the mercantile community&amp; -'I &gt; % i and he has undertaken tc place statics at the disposal of the Political Agent and to give him any infcrmat ion that he may require• On my recent tour I was further enabled tkraati through the courtesy of ills Majesty's Minister, to take with me Mr. Vlce-Ocnsul Blanch, to whom I am greatly indebted for the ccmpilatlcn of the attached memorandum, collection of samples, etc. He deals with all commercial matters in my office, and I am confident that if His Majosty^s Vice Consul at Bushire is enabled to visit the Arab Ooast in my company once or twice a year, it will do of groat assistance to myself and the local Officers and ultimately I hope benefit tc British trade. The market may not 9t present be large, but the standard of living is rising, ana with it will come an increased demand for goods STof a better auallty. At any rate the Japanese seem to think it worth cultivating, and I would invite your attention to the remarks contained in Mr. Blanch's Memorandum regarding their methods.

I had definitely told then that I could not unaertake a fresh burden with my limited staff and the Resident informed the Lepartraent of Overseas Trade that although I would not be able to supply the inform ation they wanted from time to time,it was hoped that you would be able to do so. I am sending you in original a letter i have received from the Resident which shows what information they now require. I would be very grateful if you would go into the matter and so far as possible let me have a Statement giving the information required. It would be convenient if this could be sent in quadruplicate You will see that a considerable amount of labour will be entailed and it will probably take some little time before you are able to give me the information wanted. Ahen writing please make it clear that it is you who are supplying the information and I shall simply forward your report in original to the authorities concerned. I am asking the Resident whether the samples should bebe sent direct to England or Bushire and this Office will meet the expenses on acquiring them. Please let me have the Resident's letter back when /ou have done with it. C.C.L.LeGrenier Lsjuire, Director of Customs, Bah re in.I *0 D/0. THE CUSTOMHOUSE, BAHRAIN. 2nd February, 19^1•» l^th Raaadhan, I thank you for your D/0, No,112 of the 28/1/^1,, As requested, I return you herewith the original letter from The Hon'ble The Resident; and I have carefully noted his requirement® as to a report to be prepared upon cotton piece goods imported and sold in Bahrain, whose Country of Origin is not the United Kingdom, May I remark that this is a difficult season for the preparation of as comprehensive a report as I should like to submit, since, owing to depression in trade (especially due to the last bad pearling season) imports at present are not large in quantity or diverse in kind. Normally I would secure the required samples from packages as they are imported; but, failing this method, I shall purchase other samples in the bazar. This latter procedure will not, I fear, produce such good results as I would wish, owing to the reluctance of the oriental mentality to disclose trade information correctly. I will endeavour to submit my report as early as possible; but I trust I may be allowed a few weeks for this purpose.

MEMORANDUM, The Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade presents his compliments and encloses a list of the overseas branches of certain British firms. The head offices of these companies in the United Kingdom have been requested by the Department to assist in making known the British Industries Fair of 1932 by the display and distribution of the Pair showcards and folders through the medium of their overseas branches. The companies mentioned in the list have notified their willingness to assist in this manner and, in many cases, have informed their agents or branches accordingly. The Comptroller-General would, therefore, be glad if the necessary supplies of British Industries Fair show- cards and folders could be furnished to local branches from the supplies to be sent to overseas officers. Further supplies of showcards and folders, if required, can be obtained on application to the Department. The Department has again undertaken to send to overseas officers certain quantities of a folder issued by Messrs. Thos. Cook &amp; Son, Ltd., and it has been brought to notice that in several instances in the past supplies of this folder have been erroneously sent to overseas branches of competing firms such as the American Express Co., Ltd., with the request that the folders might be disseminated. Overseas officers are requested, therefore, to exercise great care in this respect when distributing their supplies of Messrs, Cook ! s literature.THE great tournament at Carnoustie, Scot land, must be voted an unqualified success, except for the weather, which might have been less unkind.

It is no exaggeration to say that the Gibson of Kmghorn Stall was a chief centre of attraction.

AUBREY BOOMER not being able to use his 'Ruffex' faced irons as yet in the States, G'bsons, during the Championship, produced for him a set of super hickory shafted irons (nine in number). These did not reach the Stall until one o'clock on the last day. Boomer was located and, handling them, said, ' These will do, they are fine,' ' I ' shall use them.' What courage—and he did use them. Going out on the last round, he shot a 73 with clubs never before used on a course, his previous rounds being 75, 77, and 80. Boomer likewise used his ' New Skoogee,' made to his own design as to sole and blade, and did some remarkable work with it. 'NEW SKOOGEE' IN MASHIE AND MASHIE NIBLICK.—Professionals, such as W. H. Davies, mentioned at the Stall that they thought these would also be good. Accordingly it should be noted that Gibsons can equally make these steel and hickory-shafted at the same price as for the Niblick. NOTE. —Aubrey Boomer wins the French Open Championship, June 1931, with a score of 292, using his new set of nine hickory-shafted irons and his ' New Skoogee ' niblick, all made for him by Gibsons of Kinghorn less than a week previously. Mr Boomer was heard to say to a crowd in the hall of his Hotel at Deauville, after he had equalled the record for the course (67): ' I was in an almost ' impossible position in a bunker, but took a mar- ' vellous club, which I bought at Carnoustie, and ' laid the ball dead ' (the ' Skoogee ').

Whatever other trade exhibitors may nave said about slowness of trade, Gibsons had nothing of which to complain—in fact, they are gratified to report good business.

L. Ritchie ' set, woods and irons, were the ' best clubs that Gibsons had ever produced.' THE 'GRAMPIAN DE LUXE' TORSION IRONS.—Duncan, on being assured Gibsons were to the fore in production of a jar free steel-shafted iron, tried out and reported that he got a bit farther with it (a No. 2 Iron,' Ruffex ' face) than with his own club. Other compliments were passed upon these ' jar free ' irons. GIBSONS' PATENT TORSION GRIP (No. 21344/30).—Gibsons fit this patent Torsion grip to any and every type of steel-shafted iron on request, at a charge of 2/- extra wholesale, 3/- retail. This renders the clubs sting free, ensuring comfortable and enjoyable play. This grip consists of a loose metal sleeve and spiral rubber windings ; these take up all shock and impart to the steel- shafted club—iron as well as wood—the same sweet feel as the finest Super ' Star ' hickory. Likewise this grip is productive of maximum power and comfort. Approved by the Rules of Golf Committee of the R. &amp; A. Club, St Andrews, and the U.S. Golf Association. Gibsons are the sole Patent Licensees of the Patent Grip, as well as the Patent Bolt used for iron heads in place of the traditional rivet, making for much additional strength in the neck. THE 'RUFFEX' (REGD.) IRONS—a// Gibson Models. —These were, as expected, much in call, especially for steel-shafted sets. These impart better control and are anti-glare. Specially adapted for hot climates. The extra cost is only 6d. a club (in quantities 4d. a club). Your members will be calling for these, so be ready with a suitable selection—they will sell quickly. Many competitors used them in the Championship. Approved by R. &amp; A. Club. SETS OF SPECIAL CLUBS made during the Championship. —Gibsons were commanded to make several sets and single clubs for overseas and home professionals, and all expressed their appreciation of the unremitting service rendered— several were actually used in the Championship with fine results {vide Aubrey Boomer). THE 'W. L. RITCHIE R'S THE ADDINGTON ' set of steel-shafted clubs, wood and iron. —These were an outstanding feature of the whole Exhibition {vide Geo. Duncan's opinion herein). Gibsons took orders for hundreds of these clubs, all in sets, woods and irons—the latter ' Ruffex ' faced and solid Rustless. The model style and finish were remarked upon as being par excellence. These Ritchie clubs carry a unique finish to the shaft—Gibsons' own ' Stella-rite '— the nearest yet to the ' hickory.' This finish is scientifically applied to the metal and will stand up to the work without chipping, etc. The prices are given in the centre inset of the Gibson 1931 List. Large demands are certain, and a selection of these should form part of all up-to-date golf stocks. THE ' NEW SKOOGEE ' NIBLICK, non- concave. —This straight-faced club conforms with the latest ruling of the Royal and Ancient Club and created a veritable sensation at the Champion ship. Previous to the meeting, Gibsons had sold this niblick to one or two members of the British Ryder Cup Team for America, and at the Exhibi tion Gibsons sold this club to all of the free lances going off to battle for the American Open—W. H. Davies and Aubrey Boomer were loud in their praise of the ' Skoogee.' We made it well laid back for them, with the larger blade. Boomer's was the latest and the last word in niblicks. The ' Skoogee ' is the great stroke saver and is essential to every player. All of the foregoing were super hickory shafted—prices, W T averley Heads, 6/-; Rustless Heads, 10/- ; finished hickory, Waverley, 12/-; Rustless, 16/-. Prices for steel-shafted— Black ' True Temper ' Waverley, 14/-; Rustless, 17/- (full prices detailed page 13 of 1931 ' Star ' List). A steel-shafted ' Apollo ' ' Skoogee ' was made during the Championship for a French pro fessional who finished well up in the list. GIBSONS' NEW ' KOMPAKTA ' STAR (REGD.) IRONS, with the thicker top edge and shorter blade adapted to the new and lighter ball.— These new heads at the Stall were much admired and considered ideal. One American professional was greatly intrigued with these blades—the finest he had yet seen in this country, and added that with a certain further amendment in detail, should command a ' magnificent sale '—these are his exact words.

In tha light of such figures as ar? avaltlabli the total Arab ^oa=t i^orts of cotton piece goods would appser to a'lount in a 3°° 8O ^Vx),000 of which bj far the largest P^ortxon xs absorbed by Bahrein; the principal entrepot for the nisrKets ^ ^ ^ 1 I'orth Eastern Arabia. Recent years nave seen th 3 rxc. of x 1 rucial &gt;ian as a distributing centre of increasing inportanc ,. -n- general trade potentialities of the ai-ea depend al^st exclusively upon n«arl trace of the upper Gulf and a very mfc.rKed falling oil in tn. import figures for 19S0-i981 may be anticipated owing to tne exception ally depressed condition of this industry at tue P^^en^ v ^ Statistics of imports covering the period 1st April 192'/ to elst ..ai 1930 are given in the second appendix to tins repox o. British Iinports . It is not possible to give any accurate idea of tue extent of British imports and the percentage figures givin in tne appendix are rough estimtes only. They would suggest that British piece goods are imported to th. value of some £50,000 only at the present time and there has undoubtedly bem a considerable falling of: in -he ^st f. years. Foreign imports have increased very appreciably of late. Japanese^ ItSia^ i^tch. Central Suropean and more ^oantl, Wen roods have entered the market, which was formerxy supp-iea el ost ,x- clusiv^l bv Indian a.id British products. If the Japanese maintain their present rate of expansion they will soon be challenging tne indi-n position as the principal suppliers of the market, ^ile Hussian goods, which are just beginning to find their way into .to,an;, :tfy o. r.Ai. on to afford competition which to all intents and purposes ignores economic factors? It will not unlikely that with th. potions loosed by Persia on all inserts the hissians mcy well Sv-Jc an for their Persian Gulf shipments on the Arab boast. Possibil it ies of an increas ed_• There seems no likelihood of a general growth in demand in the near future. The movement at present is all the othsr v ;ay and any revival would benefit low quality cheap priced goods, such as Japan supplies at present.5. Without considarable reduction in price ano ^ualit^ it will be difficult for Brit isii products to recapture lost ground. Jir^ct^ importation from me.nufacturers is rarely resorted to. Small oazaar stall keepers are frequently content to stoci: tneroselves fro-n larger local merchants wno buy their cloth from irrporters in India ana xraq and not infrequently maKe personal -/isitstwo or nore times^ a year o either country in order to effect purchases. The market is very l^r^ely supplied tarough agents in Inaia - more particulLxly i.omba^ ' end Karaciii - and local merchants frequently retail their goods^on a co-mission basis of from ij to 2^ per cent. The^long-continuea existence in Banrain of a Hindu comaercial community, mostly orawn from Tatta is Sind, iu ;-s restated in the imports of cotton piece goods being mainly of the character most suited, to the Indian markets, tor tue local rabs purchase such as ere available in the bazaar. Thus the majority of friglish cotton piece goods imported in Bahrain come torougi the various dindu firms, all of whom are brenches of other fir^s m India. Payment is arranged througl:i BtinKs in India or in the case ot Bahrein the shipping docwnonts may be sent to the loctl brancii of t. e Eastern BanK for surrender against cash. C.I.F. destination's un- ^ doubtedly the best method of quoting as it enables the xocal xrader, working to very narrow mc.rgins of profit, to Knew exc.ctly 'wxi^re ho stands when ordering. Foreign coripetitors, especially the Japanese seem vory ready to o-o after the market and find out what the local trader wants. Also once having established connection they frequently offer new patterns zaid give close attention to their clients suggestions and requirements. In this connection it should be borne in mind that local tastes and fashions frequently change - a particular print that ha,pens to catch on when introduced cannot be expected to maintain its popularity indefinitely. The Japanese hava realised this, end when local ^traders go down to Karachi and Bombay to obtain new ideas and stocks against the return of the pearling fleets in October, tney are ready xor tn^ci with new designs. If British manufacturers are prepared to go to the trouble of corresponding with merchants, sending samples and giving attention to suggestions received, they could maintain much closer touch with the market. It is doubtful if the .expense of sending representatives to make personal investigation of local conditions would be warranted. The reason, above all others, for the popularity of competitive goods is their cheapness, also to a lesssr extent the fact tn^.t definite efforts are made to meet local tastes. It is very doubtful([S) if British manufacturei-s will ba able to compot 3 unless tnsy are willing to produce the inferior grades of dotn that tiie Japanese are offering end at si'iil-r prices.

British manufacturers often 1 nave it to the local merchants to approach them instead of soliciting orders. 2. British goods are too expensive. 3. They are too good and their quality is not appreciated by the average purchasar. The first step to be taicen to popularise British goods therefore is for United Kingdom Exporters to corrraunicate with local dealers send ing samples giving rupee prices C.i.F. destination and inviting comments. Thereaft ^r it is Isrgely a question of reducing prices and special attention to designs which should be varied as frequently as possible. Once the interest of locel dealers has been aroused there is little scope for farther advertisement of products - the general public is illiterate. While the mer^et of Bahrain is not a very large on3, yet it seems desirable to encourage merchants having business connections with the mainland of Arabia to extend their trading and there appears oo ds a definite opening in this direction through the local Ilassawi mer- cnants, provided that tne British manufacturers are prepared i-o enter into active competition 'vitn tne steady inflow of Indian manufactured piece goods. This can be effected by offering piece goods that are cneap, lasting, and of bright designs. The running of the Bahrain market could be done by correspondence with the local traders, submitting a wide range of samples, and quoting c.i.f. Bahrain (in sterling, or preferably in Indic-n currency) , with terms of cash against documents at the local branch 01 the eastern Ba-uv Ltd. , and supported cy an attractive discount. Prom this method a steadily improving trade might be looked for.5. @) Trade iviarks etc., should, whenever desired, be shown in Arabic, at the i^orter's option; and it is particularly inroortant that the actual shrunk length of the pieces should be exactly as printed on the pieces, certainly not less. Under no circumstances should a quotation be f.o.b., port of supplying country, because the local trader is always anxious to ascertain closely what his iniport will cost nim before receipt, as he works to a margin of profit of a few annas. Po ssibility of Inc r eased Oo-npe tition . Cheap shoddy goods are unfortunately admirably suited -o the market and it seems probable that iTrports of Japanese goods will in crease owing to their cheapness and there is a livelihood that Italian goods will come forward in small but increasing quantities a.3 their designs are very pleasing. Opening up Trade Relations . A circular letter accompanied if possible oy samples, to suit able merchants would appear the best method - preferaoly in Arabic, since few, other than among the Hindu Community, understand or write English. As a general rule business on a commission basis would seem most suited to local requirements and most favoured by dealers. Customs etc. The cost of irrporting goods into Bahrain is reasonable, beings (l) Landing Charges, payable to the Steamers' Agent, (2) Inport Yard^ charges (i.e. Warehouse Rent, porterage, pier fees and municipal tax), and (2) Irrport Duty at 5 per cent ad valorem. The whole of these expenses would aggregate a little less txian 7 per cent ad valorem, but where cargo is re-shipped direct to the mainland 01 ^raoia, a 1 e— fund is granted of three per cent ad valorem. Customs storage is safe, and clearances are very prompt.PAgT_ II e (Dealing more i^rxticulsrly v/ith the mar ice t in the Principality of Kuv/ait). Lo cal Production . cotton piece goods of any Kind are manufactured in Kuwait, The chi^f cloth manufactured and then in primitive style, is call 3d 'Darry Bisht', and is exclusively used for making 'Bishts' or Arab cloaks (known el severe as 'Abb alls'). This cloth is woven from Sii^aps wool and txie thread is spun locally by poorer class of .Tabs as a sort of spare-timo hoob; , 'Dairy Bisht' cloth is availabl- in two quant it i is^ the first of a coarse and thick texture, which is used by men and women alike for their winter cloaks, end the second, 0; ^ a finer texture, which is mainly us ad by men only for their summer cloaks. Tnis 'Dai'-iy Bisht' is usually available in lengths of 6 to % yards and costs on an average from £0.10-8 to £0,13.4 a piece. A rolx or piace, su^xicimt for one cloakjtaices from 4 to 6 days to -weave. A simil r cloth woven f rom carnal-wool is pJso available at a iiigher cost and is known as 'v/ubDar'. This is for the most part manufactured at the Persian Seaboard and in the district of DASHTI# Th ^re is a t.iird kind of very coarse doth which is universally used a 1 o;ig the Nomad Bedouin of tne interior for making their tents. It is woven by tribal women from goats ano shoep hair into long strips Ig- feet wide, and in lengths as desired. A length 25 feet long costs i.0,8,0 approximately. Five strips go to make the roof of each tent, while other strips are used for the sides,usually aiother five. Imports of British Goods . It is most difficult to give exact figures of the proportion of piece O oods imported in^o Ku'.vait from 2-reat Britain, as a considerable amouu. Oz coi v imodity is iiTported via India and Inaq, and is given out by local shopkeeper to be of English origin. There can however be li^t^e doubt that whereas they are marketed as British goods, they are mostly of foreign manufacture. On the other hand nearly all prints are imported i rom Manchester, and are available in many textures and shades. I-port of Foreign Goods . Apc-it from tiie difticulty of obtaining detailed information©' portaining to pises goods, locel merchants are alv/ays oxtre 'ely shy of disclosing correct wholesale prices and figures given in the appendix of this report have only been obtained with great difficulty. The term 'piece goods' of course embraces many kinds, qualities and grades of cloth, but the main lines of foreign piece goods obtainable in the Kuwait bazaar are:- (1) Long cloth or sheeting. (2) Artificial silks. (3) Muslinette and Voile. (4) Imtation -woollen materiel or flannelette. (5) Head*- cloths or Kliaffiyas. (6) Coarse silk faoric Known as ' JgZZ 'o (1) Lon.?, cl o th sheeting is avilable in different grades and t extures and is principally imported from Russia, Japara, America and China while a good deal comes from Manchester. Russian sheeting which is not as yet i^rported in large quantities, but which shows a distinct signs of increasing, finds its way in Kuwait by dhow and mostly from IvSbhammerah, where from all accounts it continues to arrive in enormous quantities with other Russian cotton goods. Japanese, American, Snglish and Chinese sheeting is either imported via 'Iraq and India or direct. It is obtainable in crea^. and white and the prices vary according to th quality, width and texture as will be seen from the different accompany ing samples. American, Japanese and Cninese shjeting is the most popular in Kuwait, as the first is claimed to be very durable, and the latter cheaper and therefore in groat demand among the poorer class of Arabs for making their long shirts (Disdashas). (2) Artificial SIIk is steadily gaining popularity in Kuwait. It is now greatly in demand by Arab ladies of the middle and well-to-do class for purposes of dresses. Japan and in particular Italy are the main sources from thich the supply is imported, though Austria is now coming into the maricet. The artificial silk goods are of good quality and of gr3at variety and colour, types D, E and V mentioned in the appendix being especielly popular.8, inferior silic fro in China is also procurable in smaller quantities, but silks imported fron Italy preponderate. (3) Misl inette and Voile are also imported from India and Italy i especoi'/ely. Txie lormer is available in different shades especially black, and^is almost universally used by ^.rab ladies of all classes for their long trailing overall garment called 'Thob'. Voile is used for 'Thob' also, as well as for dresses, particularly that bear ing the embroidered floral design, shown in the appendix under Type A. (4) wool l?!! ma-t ori a l or f lannelette is imported from Japan. it is \70rn by ever/ Arab v/oman of Kuwait (lower and middle classes) during the winter months, and takes the places of what the '/'est Knows as woollen und 3rgarments. nead - cloths of ''IQ iaffiyas' . Those of woollen manufacture for the cold Arabian winter are imported from India primarily and are sold at a pncD rarging from £0»6.8 to £0.9.4 each. A few come from Cxerr-iany and are slightly cheaper. Cotton 'Khaffiyas' rea dand blue are principally drawn from Manchester, and the popular kind can be purchased for iSO.M. These are of co^orse of different siz ;s and those commonly available are from 14 to 48 inches square. The plain white cotton Khaffiya witn fringed edge is hov7ever rapidly gaining in popularity especially in the desert, and is a line British manu facturers could well take up, (s) T he si lk f abric /oiowii as Jeza (.made of silk wastings) has an enormous popularity and in winter is used by almost everyone in Kuwait and among the tribes, as a warm overgarment to the flannelette under garment mentioned in 4, above. It is iirported in rolls of 16 yard^s long at £0.10.0 for the best quality. It is in natural colour and purdiassrs dye it locally a grass green, black, brown and maroon colours according to taste, British manufacturers would do well to try and capture this marKet. £2ssioilitieG of in cr eased British trade . Cotton goods and artificial silks constitute by far the most important import of manufactured goods and is one in which the British position is being fiercely attacked by strong Italian and Japanese competition. The total value of the iirports of piece goods during the last year viz. from 1st April 1929 to 51st March 1930 amounted to £39,023 which was accounted for as under:-9. ® at (1) India (including re Exports) £32,069 (2) Iraq do, do. 4,280 (3) Persian Coast. 2,086 (4) .Lrab Coast 402 (5) Countries not specified. 186 Total £ 39,025 As elreody mentioned it is vary difficult to find out exactly what proportion of amounts ^1 j end (2) is shared a^ong the principal, competing countries since a great part of the piece goods trade comes through. India or Iraq, end is shown as 'of Indian origin ' in the local Customs figures. But generally speaicing British piece goods come via Iraq., and Japanese, Italian etc, via India. Considering the whole aspect of the trade and the low nominal 4P,o ad valorem ^ustom duty charged on goods landing at Kuwait, there would appear to be a far more promising field for an increased British trade in Kuwait than at present is the case but British firms will have to come down in their prices so as to compete with the artificial silks, sheetings and other cotton fabrics imported from Italy, America, Qiina, Russia and Japan. It should be realized that most of the people of Kuwait ere not far removed from the Bedouin nomad., ans as such are not educated enough yet to r ealize the value of, and the saving on c good article. This is on3 of the chief and foremost reasons why foreign piece goods find a better market end ere more appreciated thui British goods. Foreign manufacturers appear also to study local requirements 'lore then British firms do, for instance Japan has realized that the white cotton vest or singlet with circular collar is the garment wanted by divers and sailors of the G-ulf in summer. She has accordingly gone for their market and captured it. Similarly Italy is trying to capture the loc?J U quilt' trade b^ flood ing the market with cheap but very good tartan rugs which are sold at £0.12.0 and £0,14.8 end which she hopes will oust the quilt. She probably will succeed, for the article is very popular, British firms might with advantage try pushing their trade by means of /rabic and Persian spearing travelling agents, whom one very rarely sees in this part of the world, Zs regards trading methods common to the market, direct importation from the manufacturers in foreign countries is not often10. done as r -iost of tho 3 -Ocal merca.ants hr.ve their a^ents in India end in iraq through viiom they transact business, 'both on coirmssion and purchasing basis, tho inethcd of quoting being al'iost invariably c.i.f. destirkT.tion, and f. o.b. port of supplying country. Sugges tions for popularizi ng Brit ish good s. The best procedure for fims desiring to op .en up trade relat ions for the first time with local merchants, is for then to send several copies of catalogues, and sa~:pl3 books of goods vrhich have to offer, to the Political Agent at Kuwait. It is most irqportant that these shoi,ild quote prices in rupees as v:ell as sterling. The Political /gent '/ill be glad to circulate literature etc. anongst merchants as well as forward addresses should any British fin a \jlsh to communicate with local merchants. as stated elsewhere in this report, there are very few merchants who import goods direct, but the few that do, and whose financial standing is said to be sound, are obtainable from the Department of Overseas Trade. Possibility of increased conpetition . As mentioned above fierce conpetition exists already from Japanese and Italian manufacturers. America, Austria and India are increasing t heir business, whilst the conpetitor most to be feared is Russia which is just starting to get' her piece goods into Kuwait at cut-throat prices. Once she gets nold she will be hard to 'imock out' , for the Arab is poor and will b$y the cheapest article he can especially in the present extremely serious economic situation in which he finds himself owing to the failure of the pearl trade of the last two years. Give him more money and he mil buy better goods but as long as he is poor he will go for the cheapest article always. The names and addresses of the principal importers of piece goods in the Arabian coast districts of the Persian Gulf can be ob tained on application to the Department of Overseas Trade. If further information is required on x^oints not covered by this report, the Department will be pleased to endeavour to supply it on request.11.

We have since ascertained that the firra^ although it has only been established for about four months, enjoy an excellent refutation and are well-known. Their business is that of diamond brokers, and it is understood that they are so well regarded that parcels of precious stones up to as much as £5,000 could safely be entrusted to them for the purpose of sale. As brokers, they do not of course require credit. Mr.Harvey, a member of the firm, proposes to call at this Department on Monday, the 2ord instat, when he will be given further available infomation on the subject of his enquiry. Should he ask tor any additional particulars, we will adopt the usual procedure of asking the India Office officially to be so good as to forward the request to the Political Agent at Bahrein.

Gentlemen, ^ Your letter of November 5th, on the subject of the pearl trade in the Persian Oulf, addressed to the Colonial Office, has been forwarded to this Departm^it. The delay in replying is due to that cause, and is regretted, 2. As you are probably aware, Bahrein is the centre of the pearl industry and is the chief market in the Oulfe Latterly, important Continental, Indisn and Arab merchants, who used to send their agents, now go themselves to that island. Most of the important buying and selling is done ashore. The chief buyers, as last reported, are the Continental merchants, viz: Messrs. Rosenthal Si Pack, ^ohamed Ali Zianal, and his partner, Mr.Bienenfield, and a few Indian and Persian merchai ts« They normally arrive at Bahrein as soon as the opening of t'le season (May) has commenced, and leave a week or tw after it closes during the month of October. The pearls argpolished and graded in Bombay and then taken to Paris and London for sale to inglish and American buyers. It is possible that with easier comrainicati on between Europe end the Sast by modern air routes, and improved living conditions in Bahrein, opportunities will arise for more buyers to go to that district in the future. A good deal/ Messrs.Harvey % Lockitt*iilK v deal of the actual buying and selling is done through brokers who take the pearls from merchant to merchant, and offer them for sale. The brokers are given a commission from the buyer, or b T r special arrangement from both parties. The normal total year's catch is difficult to state exactly. It is understood that in 1927 pearls to the approximate value of £600,000 were brought to London, and at a rough estimate, a year's catch can be calculated as worth between one and three million pounds. 3. The only nev.spapers likely to circulate in the district concerned are the following, which are published in Basra:- (a) The Times of Mesopotamia (Daily). Advertisements - Rs.3/- per inch. (b) Al-nash fl-jadid (Bi-weekly). Advertisements - no fixed charges. No ma^zines or similar periodicals are published locally. It is well to point out that these papers do not circulate extensively among Arab readers in the Grulf, and generally speaking, the local press cannot be considered as an important factor in business. 4. In addition to the above, there is a certain amount of confidential information about the pearl trade on file at the Department of Overseas Trade. This could be communicated orally to a responsible representative of your firm if he would afford the undersigned the courtesy of an interview, which should preferably be arranged by telephone.

Provided raw Shark Skins were available in large quantities, and at any rate that the supply was a regular one, there is a oonsiderable businaas to be done. There are however a considerable number of speoies, as you will see from the enclosed instruotions. Sizes preferred are the larger skinz, viz: 10 square feet and over in area. Wet-salted Shark Hides weigh approximately 1 lb. per square foot. They would be sold at per lb., values ranging from 7d to IGd. In the first place it would be necessary to obtain samples of the different species, unless the Latin or other name of the shark could be furnished, when we would then be able to give detailed information. There is a certain mnrket for dried Shark meat locally, and fins could be sold to Singapore and China. We ourselves cannot handle these. Shark Oil we can handle in the ordinary way.RMP. (Ot®? 26559/1952• COPY. PROD0CTS OP THS SHARK. anSRAX IHPOHMATIOH AND INSTRUCTIONS. The Shark must be skinned as soon as possible after being oaught. rhis is very important. Some speoies spoil quicker than others, but any shark will spoil in 24 hours 01 less, ana the hides as well as the by*»produots have to be cured and prepared within a few hours after the shark is removed from the water* Avoid exposure to the sun, and do not let the hides, or for that matter any shark products coae into contact with fresh water. The following' speoies Ox sharks are known to be commonly valuable:- (1) Leopard or Tiger (6) Black Tip (2) Dusky (7) Mackerel Shark (5) Brown (6) Nurse (4) Sand (9) Sawfish (5) Sandbar (10) Hacinerhead In addition to this there may be other sharks which are valuable, or the species of sharks mentioned may be known by different names in different countries. Ths value ol' the hides depends on the size of the shark, and the price schedule is the same for all species mentioned. The hide is measured from tip to tip lengthwise and the value is calculated on the number of lineal inches. Xl^LD* The yield of oil per shark depends on the species, and size, and the season of the year. When the oil is used for industrial purposes, the value is the same for the oil of all species. The livers from which the oil is rendered form a very large part of the shark, and are practically all oil. -^UALIT/. a'he quality of all shark products depends greatly on the proper handling, curing, preparing and packing. The instructions hereinafter given apply to all species of shark as much as possible. However, the different species are only slightly diilerent in form and shape, and the instructions can be easily adjusted to these different speoies. likewise, the diagrams are composite sketches of the different species. DSTAIL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SKINNING, CURING AND PREPARING SHARK HIDES (1) The first operation is to remove all the fins and the tail. This is done simply by cutting off the fins with a sharp knife. They should be cut in a curve into the fin, which will thereby leave little or no meat or skin on the fin. The fleshy part 01 the tin which now remains should be trimmed off as close as possible to the carcase. The tail is then removed by cutting same/0 &gt; i 7 aame oompletely off just above the root. The root is indioated by a amail knob on the back of the shark. Do not throw away fins or tail, as they are valuable. (2) The second operation is to plit the shark. The hide is split on the BACK (not on the belly as is the case with cow hides). Insert the knife (which should be very sharp) in the holes made by removing the Dorsal Fins and split the hide along the back as straight as possible, first towards the tail end where the tail has been cut off, then towards the head, midway between the eyes, to a point where the brain is located. This point is indicated by small holes (pores) on the head- On some species of shark, these holes begin ^ or 6 inches from the nose tip. Therefore, do not run the back split up to the nose tip but stop where the small holes begin. Then begin to cut sideways around the shark (on both aides) in the same manner) down to a point in line with the eyes and top of the gills, then cut in the direction of the eyes, passing just above the eyes and Just above the gills, until, the holes made by removing the side fins (pectoral fins) are reached. Then proceed to cut again in the direction of the jaws, and proceed to cut towards the lower jaw, and cut along the rim of the mouth keeping an inch or two from the edge. These two cuts (one on each side) will meet midway under the mouth, and this part of the hide constitutes the chin flap. (5) The third operation in the actual cutting. Turn the carcass on its belly again, and straddle same, facing the direction of the head. Take the left side split of the section of the hide near the head, on the left hand, holding firmly while the right hand operates on the skinning knife (which should be very charp) and the hide is then peeled off by cutting away the carcass. Great care should be used in operating the skinning knife, to avoid cuts to the hide. Do not be afraid to leave too much meat on the hide; this surplus meat can be removed by fleshing. If skinning is done too close, cuts may result at the slightest slip of the knife. After the left side is skinned, turn around facing the tail end, and skin the other side in the same manner as before. The left hand should always keep the hide pulled tight while skinning. (4) After the hide is taken off the carcass, wash same thoroughly in sea water, removing all the blood and slime. The next operation is to remove all the surplus flesh; this is done on a beaming board with the use of a beaming kniie. The beaming knife is a large curved knife with a handle on each end. The beaming board should be about 6 feet long, and about feet wide. One end should rest on the floor, while the other end has a support, keeping it to the height of a man's waist. The beaming board should have a curve to correspond to the curve of the beaming knife. The board should be absolutely smooth. .In fleshing, it is important that the hide is kept smooth on the board, and that no meat particles or other substances are between the board and the hide. if for some reason the hides cannot be fleshed at once they should be put in brine immediately where they may stay overnight. The brine should be strong enough to float an Irish potato about 4 inches long. If possible, aroia keeping the hides in brine more than 2 or 5 hours. If they are kept in brine more than 12 bourse they are spoiled. On the/the other h»yad, keeping them in brine only 2 or 3 hours will assist in removing the blood and alime better than if only sea water is used. (5) (hile the hide is still on the beaming board, it should be tri jned. The outer edges and the sharp corners and the small meat particles which may b ngover after fleshing should be out off# The hides should be split in the tail end. This is done simply by cutting from the hole left by the Ventral Fin towards the tail end, passing through the hole left by the Anal Pin and then straight back to where the tail has been cut off. The Leopard Shark has on the tail end two keels or boney ribs, one on each side, running from the tail along the body 4 to 12 inches. This part of the hide of the Leopard Shark is worthless, and has to be cut off. The Sawfish is not split in the tail, but this species also has two keels or boney ribs extending from the tail end 4 to 12 inches, which pert of the hide is worthless, and should be cut off. (6) After the fleshing and trimming, the hides should be thoroughly washed-B sea water. No blood or slime should remain on the hides; they should then be salted for curing. The curing is done in the following manner: Sprinkle some salt on the platform or floor where the hides will be laid. Then lay one hide on flat, flesh side up, being sure to smooth out all the wrinkles, and sprinkle salt so as to coyer every part of the surface. Put plenty of salt on the hide. On top of this hide put the next one, flesh side up, and salt in the same manner, and so on. It is preferable to la,/ the hides on a platform, which has a straight incline, so that the water and brine can run off. The pile of hides should be built up as evenly as possible, without any burapa or depressions. The large hides take about 8 days to cure. Sven the smaller hides should be left in this salt pile for 5 or 6 days, during which they must be covered with plenty of salt. Whilst curing they should of course not be exposed to the rays of the sun, or come in contact with rain or other fresh water. Before packing the hides for shipment they should be measured. The measurement is taken from tip to tip. In order to arrive at the length of the hide, it is customary to fold same over. The hides are prepared lor shipment in barrels in the following manner: Sjhake the hide slightly so that the surplus salt falls off. then lay the hide on the floor, flesh side up, and sprinkle same dry salt over the entire surface. Then fold so as to make a flat square bundle of each hide. A 55 gallon barrel will hold 25 average shark hides. The weight will be about 275 pound net. If the transportation Company will take hides packed in other containers than barrels, they can be used. Watertight barrels are sometimes required by certain steamship companies. This is on account oi the leakage of brine en route. ( oce) The salt used for curing and packing hides should not be too coarse. Medium grain fishery salt gives the best results. t ineral salt is preferable to sea water salt. Be sure that the brine is not too weak, and that sufficient salt is used. The surplus GLiAK salt may be used over again, in which case a larger quantity must be used, as it gradually loses its strength.\ ■ ' ■ D.O .No; ^ .

Yours ^incereljSXTRAT FROM LETTER FROM CULVERVOLL BROOKS 6c CO.? 59,Mark Lane., LONDON E.G.3. i Dated 11th ;aj 1932- Provided raw bhark Skins were available in large v quantities,and at any rate that the supply was a regular ■ L one,there is a considerable business to be done. There are however a considerable number of species,as you will see from the enclosed instructions. Sizes preferred are the larger skins.viz: 10 square feet and over in area. Wet-salted Shark Hides weigh approximately 1 lb per square foot. They would be sold at per lb.,wkrasx values ranging from 7d to lOd. In the first place it would be necessary to obtain samples of the different species,unless the i.atin or other name of the shark could be furnished,when we would then be able to ^ive detailed information. There is a certain market for dried Shark meat locally,and fins could be sold to Singapore and China. .Ve ourselves cannot handle these. Shark oil we can handle in the ordinary way.PRODUCTS. OF THE SHaRK. GENERAL INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTION. SKIMINC . The shark must be skinned as soon as possible after bein^ caught. This is very important. Some species spoil quicker tfien others,but any shark will spoil in 24 hours or less,and the hides as well as the by-products have t9 be cured and prepared within a few hours after the shark is memoved from the water. Avoid exposure to the sun,and do not let the hides ? or for that matter any shark products come into contact with freshwater, i'he follow ing species of sharks are known to be commonly valuable: (1). Leapard or Tiger. (6). Black Tip. (2;. Dusky. f7). Mackerel Shark. ^3^. Brown. (8). Nurse. (4). Sand. (9). Sawfish. (5;. Sandbar. (10). Hammerhead. In addition to this there may be other sharks which are valuable.or the species of sharks mentioned may be known by different names in different countries. VALUE . The value of the hides depends on the size of the shark,and the price schedule is tnexsame for all species mentioned. The hide is measured from tip to tip length wise, and the value is calculated on the number of lineal inches. YIELD. The yield of oil per shark depends on the species, and size,and the season of the year. Khen the oil is used for industrial purposes,the value is the same for oil of all species. Tlie livers from which the oil is rendered form a very large part of the shark,and are practically al oil. QUALITY . The quality of all shark products depends greatly on the proper handling,curing,preparing and packing. The instructions hereinafter given^apply to all species of ska sharks as much as oossible. However,the different species are only slightly different in form and shape and the instructions can be easily adjusted to these different species. Likewise the diagrams are composite sketches of tne different species. DETAIL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SKINNING,CURING AND PREPARING SHARK HIDES. (1). The first operation is to remove all the fins and the tail, 'i'his is done simply by cutting oft the fins with a sharp knife. They should be cut m a curve into the fin,which will thereby leave little or no meat or ski on the tin. The fleshy part of the fin which now remains should be trimmed off as close as possible to the carcase The tail is then removed by cutting same completely offfay -2- iust above tlie root, '-^he root is indicated by a small Knob on the back of the shark. Eo not throw away fins or tail,as they are valuable. (2). The second operation is to pilt the shark. The hide is split on the BACK (not on the belly as is the case with cow hides)• Insert the knife (which should be very sharp) in the holes made by removing the Dorsal Fins and split the nide along the back all straight as uossible,first towards the tail end where the tail has been cut off,then towardsthe head midway between the eyes,to a point where the brain is located. This point is indicated by small holes (porej on the head. On some species of shark.these holes begin b or 6 inches from the nose tip. Therefore, do notvrun the back split up to the nose tip but stop where the small holes begin. Then begin to cut sideways around the shark (on both sides) m the same manner down to a point in line with the eyes and lop of the gills,then cut in the direction of the eyes, passjust above the eyes and just above the gills,until, the holes made by removing the side fins (pectoral fins; are reached. Then proceed to cut again in the direction of the jaws,and proceed to cut towards the lower jaw and cut along the rim of the mouth keeping an inch or two from the eage. ihese two cuts (one on each side) will meet midway under the i^outh,and this part of the hide constit utes the chin flap. (3). The third operation is the actual cutting. Turn the carcase on its belly.and straddle same,facing the direction of the head, lake trie left side split of the section of the hide near trie head,on the left hand.holding firmly whiL the ngnt hand operated the skinning knife (which should be very sharp; and the hide is then peeled off by cutting away the carcase. G-reat care shoula be used in operating the skinning knife,to avoid cuts into the hiae. to not ' oe afraid to leave too much meat on the hide; this surplus meat can be removed by fleshing. If skinning is done too close,cuts may result at the slightest slip of the knife. After the left side is skinn^ed.turn round facing the tail end,and skin the other side m the same manner as before. The left hand should always keep the hide pulled tight while skinning. (4). After the hide is taken off the carcase,wash same thoroughly in sea water,removing all the blood and slime. Me next operation is to remove all the surplus flesh; this is done on a beaming board with the use of a beaming knife, ihe beaming knife is a large curved knife with a xiandle on each end. The beaming board should be about J ?! and about 3^- feet wide. One end should rest on txie lloor.while the other end had a support,keepinr it to the height of a man T s waist. The beaming beard' should have a curve to correspond to the curve of the knife. The board should be absolutely smooth, in fleshing,it is important that the hide is kept smooth on the board,and thai no meat particles or other substances are between the board and the hide. If f or some reason the hides cannot be fleshed at once they should oe put^in brine immediately where they may stay orarnight. ine brine should be strong enough to float an f r ish potatoe about 4 inches long. If possible,avoid keep ing the hides in brine for more than 2 or 3 hours. If they are ^cept m brine more than 12 hours they are spoiled, on ^-3-3 the other hand keeping them in the brine onlv' 2 or 3 hours will assist in removing the blood and slime Letter than if only sea water is used. (5). While the hide is still on the beaming board,it should be trimmed. The outer edges and the sharp corners and the small meat particles which may hang over after fleshing should be cut off. The hide should be split in the tail end. This is done simply by cutting from the hol&lt; left by the ventral fin towards the tail end,passing throu| the hole left by the anal fin and then straight back to where the tail nas been cut off.

This ^art of the hide of the Leopard shark is worthless,and has to be cut off. The Sawfish is not split in the tail,but this soecies also has two keecls or honey ribs extending from tne tail end 4 to 12 incnes,which part of the hide is worthless,and should be cut off. (6). After the fleshing and trimming.the hides should be thoroughly washed in sea water. No Blood or slime should remain on the hides; they should then be salted for curing. The curing is done m the following manner: Sprinkle some salt on the platform or floor where the hides will be laid.

DEPARTMENT CF OVERSEAS TRADE, 55, Old Q.ueen Street, London, S.W.I. 12th October 1954 Dear Dplryrrple Belgrade, With further reference to your letter of the 25th September, I have to inform you, in Farrer's absence on leave, that we have consulted the Imperial Institute upon your kind offer to let them have the samples you mention, and also upon your further offer to ask the Shaikh to send shells with small pearls in them, and have now received a reply of which the following is the sub stance.- 2. The Imperial Institute would be very glad to have the samples of shells from Bahrein after Messrs.Fuerst Bros. &amp; Co.Ltd. have finished examining them. They corroborate your statement that they have at present no specimens from the Gulf. If the samples are larger than their requirements for exhibition purposes, they would be glad if they could be given permission to distnoute any surplus specimens to museums and schools in the provinces, as they receive numerous such requests. The Imperial Institute would also be glad to receive a few shells with pearls in them, as the only specimens tney have at present come from Ceylon. 5. Finally, they state that it would add greatly to the interest of their exhibit of shells if photographs of the pearling industry of the Gulf could be supplied. They made a special point of asking us to mention this fact to you when writing. Snapshots, if definite and sharp, would suit their purpose, ps they could have enlargements mpde. 1/ C.Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., Bahrein, Persian Gulf.k/ ntpb 4. I hope that you and the Shaikh will 'be pleased at the result of our consultation with the Imperial Institute who, as you will see, appear to 'be very interested in your kind offer.
