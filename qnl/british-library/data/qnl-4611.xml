THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED.COPY Hospital, Awali I* M y llth J\me, 194-7 CONFIDENTIAL MEMO. No. 294 TO: MB. R.M. BROWN FROM: Dr. R.J.BIGGAR Dr. J. PERFECT REGARDING THE SALE OF PENICILLIN AND SULPHONA MIDBS IN BAHREIN We find that penicillin is on sale in Ifenaraa without restriction, and is being indiscriminately used by unqualified persons. We regard this as inadvisable and ultimately dangerous to the public health. Penicillin is a drug that should only be used as prescribed by a fully qualified doctor. The danger can well be shown by taking the treatment of gonorrhoea, as an example. If a small dose or penicillin which has been partially inactivated by poor storage is used for the treatment of gonorrhoea, the organism will become resistant to the drug. Another small dose may be given and the organism will become.even more resistant. Eventually this results in a case which cannot be treated at all by penicillin. Moreover, any contacts of such a case will have a penicillin resistant gonorrhoea. The same is true of the sulphonamides (sulpha- thiazole, sulphadiazine, etc)., which are also on open sale in Bahrein. Both in the United States and in Great Britain the sale of these drugs is carefully restricted. We would like you to take this matter up with the Bahrein Government and suggest that they restrict the purchase of these drugs to fully qualified medical practitioners, or better still, that they should only be obtainable through the hospitals.

Dear Smith, I enclose for your personal information a copy of a Confidential ?n f enoran4uia written by doctors Big^ar and Perfect and forwarded to me by Russell Brown. 1 should be glad of your personal opinion as to whether it would be possible for the Bahrain Government to take action to restrict the sale of penicillin and sulphonamides, e.g. to allow them to be distributed only through the Bahrain Government Hospital. I have no objection to your showing the memorandum to Snow should you wish to do so. G.'Y.R. Smith, Bsq., Acting Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, B ahrain.D. 0. Ho.1837/10 Bahrain, July 9, 1947.

The drugs which yob mention discussed the matter with the Acting State Medical Officer, Dr. Doeg, who had not heard anything about the matter before. 2 . I suggest that these and any similar drugs that may be imported in future should only be sold by local chemists provided that they comply with the following conditions. The chemist should keep a register showing the quantity of dangerous drugs which he stocks. He should only sell these drugs to persons who produce a prescription from an authorised medical practitioner. He should enter in his register at the time of sale the name of the purchaser and number and date of prescription. The register of dangerous drugs shall be available for inspection by the Police or State Medical authorities when required. 3.

Dear Belgrave, The case about the cqu-trol of penicillin etc. last referred tc by yGp/(n your D.O.No,1237-10, dated the 17th April, 1948, keeps coming up in connection with other things and has now appeared as a result of the correspondenc I find that as regards Morphine and Atropin they are sold by people over whom I have got jurisdiction and control by the r King’s Regulation No.l of 1931 'Dangerous Drugs Regulations' under which the import, export, manufacture, buying or sell- ing of these dangerous drugs is an offence 'unless expressly permitted by general or special licence granted by the Political Agent'. Your reference to 'sulphur' drugs must, I think, mean 'sulfa' drugs. As far as they and penicillin are concerned, there seems to be no law in Bahrain applicabl&lt; 4 to foreigners controlling their sale. I am not quite sure even yet whether the draft alan forwarded with your letter referred to above is suitable for enactment as a King's Regulation, but,as I believe all the local chemists are Bahrain subjects, there would net in practice seem to be any necessity for a special law applying to foreigners. Do you agree? ending with your D.O.ITo, 1754-16, dated the 27th June, 1948. Yours sincerely. C.D. Belgrave, Esquire, CBS, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BAHRAIND.O. No. .viserate, \ August 25, 1948. r With reference to your D.O. No. 3376-5/^^11, dated 17th August, 1948, it is the case, as you say, that all local chemists are, at present, Bahrain subjects, therefore I agree with your suggestion that there is now no need for issuing a special law applying to foreigners. The Bahrain Government will publish the Ahlan on the subject which will apply to local chemists. We are both wrong over the word ”Sulphur :t or 'Sulfa 1 ', according to Snow it should be 'Sulpha'.
