It docs not alter territor^ls international status and does not prejudice the right of the Assembly to ctecide its futures Eor docs it prejudice the attainment of Libyan unity and inder&gt;endenc&lt; (2) The statement was communicated to the Italian Govt as soon as its terms had been approved by HEG, It cannonc in any ?;ay harm Italian interests. But the failure of the General Assembly to soprovt proposals discussed by HMG and th€' Italian Govt submitted' in an amended form by the Political Sub-Committee to the Assembly last month created a situation in fhich it was impossible for HMG to delay any longer taking whatever steps they could now to satisfy the aspirations ol Cyrer.aicans for some jeS measure of self government. HMG had administered the territory for over six years on a care and Jgp/undec) basis and further inaction on their part would be unjust inacceptable and in some degree a neglect of tne^obligations under Article 73 of the Charter of the United Nations (obligations of members responsible for administration for self governing territories C3; Vie have told the Italian Govt that we are very willing to discuss rith thera the question of the former Italian colonies xick at any time they wish* « (4) The statement was also discussed with the United States and French Govts who fully understand our position in this matter, (6) If asked whether it is proposed to take similar steps in Tripolitania you should explain that the problems in that territory are very different to those in Cjre.aica. There is in Tripolitaiia no central figurej commanding general allegiance, such as the Amir of Cyrenaica and around whom an administration could be formed; there are moreover large Italian and Jewish minorities whose existence would be a complicating factor in the establishment of any represent- -ative native administration in the territory. HMG are however considering what action they can properly take to proniote the welfare of the Tripolitanian people.

The telegram provided a justification for the British Government's recent recognition of the Emir of Cyrenaica (eastern Libya), in the event that the Resident would have to publicly defend British foreign policy in respect of the former Italian colony and quash any speculation that similar action would also be taken in the former Italian colony of Tripolitania (western Libya).According to notes at the end of the file, the telegram was circulated to the Resident and Agent, Bahrain for information.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Emirate of Cyrenaica</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Propaganda</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public information</topic></subject><subject><topic>Intelligence operations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001a0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
