He speaks about coming to Cairo to work with the American United Presbyterian Mission and then the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA). Quay recalls working with AUC Founder Charles Watson at the United Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when Watson was General Secretary, and how Watson cultivated Quay’s relative George Innes (later an AUC trustee) and other wealthy Pittsburgh-area Protestant businessmen at the time he planned the founding of the university. He provides a portrait of Watson and his wife Maria, and describes the roles, contributions, and personalities of other leading early administrators like John McClenahan (and his wife Jeanette), Wendell Cleland, and Russell Galt. The relationship between AUC and the American United Presbyterian Mission in Egypt is also explored. Quay explains how the Cairo Study Center, a program of teaching Arabic to missionaries in homes, became the School of Oriental Studies when absorbed into AUC, telling about its faculty and the sheikhs who taught there. He discusses Watson’s and the university’s emphasis on Western-style, character-building education rather than Christian conversion, and his own failed foray into proselytizing (and developing more of an open mind with respect to Islam) while teaching an ethics class at AUC. Aspects of Egyptian culture and traditions, as observed by Quay in his interaction with Egyptians are also mentioned, as is the story of the marriage between an Indian Christian convert and an Egyptian woman.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
