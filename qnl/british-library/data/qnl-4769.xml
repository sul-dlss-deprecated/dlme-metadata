An admirable article in the Field defined pastime as being “ besides the Esperanto of peoples, as perhaps the true League o Nations.” Had I started a golf-course at Sana and enrolled Imam Yahya and his white-turbaned Saiyids as life-members of the “^ o y al and Primitive Sana Golf Club,” I believe I should have hastened the conclusion of the much delayed treaty ! Robert Louis Stevenson, too, has written these pregnant words: “What religion unites peop../~* &lt;r closely as a common sport ?” ir .io * I now pass to the 1st Yemen Infantry, a development m 1918 of the wartime Arab Labour Corps. Colonel M. C. Lake, who raised the regiment, is its zealous Colonel, and the Corps is doing a gran wor as an advertiser oi British methods. These Arab soldiers take readrly to military discipline and are charged full of “ esprit de corps. Italians recruited largely from this same field during their warfare against the Turks in Tripoli, and a Colonel of theirs told me their fire- discipline was superior to that of their Abyssinian levies. We can go one better, I believe, than the Italians. The men are recruited from places all over the Yemen. Every British officer in the regiment— and my son is one of them—is a potential political officer. The 1st Yemen Infantry is a strong political asset to us, who in 1907 marched down from our headquarters in Dala and so lost that personal touch so necessary in Oriental affairs. I hear rumours of the Corps’ disband ment. I can conceive no more suicidal policy. Reverting to sports the men play a strong game of “ soccer” football, and I should like to match them against one of our 3rd Division League teams. There are certain “ lacunae” in our Aden propaganda. There is no college for the training of the young Arab chiefs, as we have in India. Early marriage and the devotion to “ kat leaf is sapping the energies of the youth. A college on the Khor Maksar plain of Aden is essential. Here the youths would be taught English and Arabic; trained in the Koran and their own classical literature. They would learn polo and other manly games. The Italians have already adopted this form of propaganda. I admire the Italians in many ways. Again, the Aden Railway, a wartime strategic line, that runs thirty- four miles from Aden to Habil, eight miles north of Lahej, might be extended as a commercial proposition. This would treble our trade. At present the railway hardly pays. A treaty with the Imam would ensure its extension, and he would in that case be pleased to grant us a sanatorium in the vicinity of Ta’izz, or even at Ibb. I learnt this during my stay in Sana. Lord Morley’s “ sun-baked officials’’ in Aden require a change of scenery. Another missing link is the absence of Boy Scouts. Somalis and Arabs would readily join the ranks. I believe in an intensive as against an extensive policy in Aden; or, to adopt the words of the</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100044802046.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2068, f 106</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100044802046.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2068, f 106</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Map of Yemen</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1930/1932</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-04-18T22:06:02</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 map</extent><extent>Materials: Printed on paper.Dimensions: 117 x 178mm, on sheet 147 x 222mm.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This map of the south-western part of Yemen has been taken from a publication and, according to a caption below the map, has been reproduced with the permission of the Royal Geographical Society.
