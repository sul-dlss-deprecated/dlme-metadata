Arnold Burrowes Kemball, Resident in the Persian Gulf, refers to his letter of 15 February (no. 60) and reports on the cessation of disorder near Tungistoon. He states that Ahmed Khan has visited Bushire for the payment of his liability and has since returned to Tungistoon, with the promise of having the district restored to him. On the subject of Bunder Abbas, Kemball states that it has been reported that members of the Arab population have sent their families to the neighbouring islands, in preparation of holding the place against the Persian troops. Kemball reports that negotiations have been pending, but that His Royal Highness Feerooz Meerza [Firouz Mirza, Governor of Fars] is said to be keeping aloof for the present. A note in the margin states that this letter was an enclosure to letter no. 177, dated 9 June 1853.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673709.0x000021#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
