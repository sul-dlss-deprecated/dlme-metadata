I enclose a copy of Article 72 of King’s Regulations and Admiralty Instructions which gives the rules for saluting the country (as distinct from personal salutes) which I gather from the correspondence is what the 'fLC. DICKSON' did. Our instructions for Afetional salutes are based on rules which have been concurred in by Maritime Powers generally. As will be seen, R.N. ships do not fire a salute unless they are satisfied that it will be returned, but I cannot say whether this particular part of our rules is applicable to foreign powers. In any case it would seem that the Americans don’t observe it. 3. I notice that M International Law of the Sea” (Higgins and Colombos), Article 131, says that it is generally recognised that a State is entitled to prescribe rules as to the salutes to be observed within its territorial waters and, again, our regulations which deal with salutes to foreign Sovereigns or Chiefs of State emphasise that H.M.

I am sending a copy of this letter to Baxter. Yours sincerely.72. KATIO^AL SALUTES. of more than one ship, visiting a foreign port where there is a fort or saluting battery, or where a ship of the nation may be lying, shall salute the national flag with 21 guns, on being satisfied that the salute will be returned. A salute is not to be fired when passing through territorial waters with no intention of anchoring, or making fast in any way, in them, ever if a saluting station is passed, unless unusual circumstances make it desirable. The salute shall be fired on each occasion that a ship visits a foreign port, except that of a ship leaving port temporarily, when, by agreement with the local authorities, the salute on her return may be dispensed with. This rule has been concurred in by the maritime powers generally. 2. When a ship visits a foreign port where there is no saluting battery and no ship of the nation is lying on arrival and a ship of the nation arrives during the visit, a salute to the national flag shall only be fired after mutual agreement between the Senior Officers of the ships concerned. 3. If the ship of a Senior British Officer is already present in the port, the junior will not fire a salute. i&gt; EX I .. y _ The Captain of a ship, or the Senior Officeru CONFIDENT IA.L D.0.NO.1043-G y COP E rt Sf 14 rsia.n gulf residency, S^xJ »J BAHRAIN, darted the 30th May 1947. /\fO ^ . }X- IA^ Please refer to the penultimate sentence of para 5 of my despa tch No.953-S dated the 17th May 1947 r egarding the difficulty experienced hy the PoliFical Agent, Kuwait, in persuading the Commander of the 'H.C.Dickson' not to give the Shaikh of Kuwait a salute of 21 guns. 2. I forward herewith a copy of a further report received from Tandy on the subject. It will be seen amongst other things from this report that the 'H.C.Dickson' gave the country a salute of 21 guns on arrival at Kuwait. 3. I attach a list of the salutes enjoyed by the Rulers of the Gulf States excluding the Sultan of Muscat. These salutes have all been sanctioned by His Majesty. I do not know to what extent other countries are bound to recognise them but they might perhaps be communicated to the U.S.A. State Department with the suggestion that they should be observed by ships of the U.S.A. Navy visiting the Gulf ports. 4. With regard to the salute to the country at Kuwait His Majesty*s ships in the Gulf never salute any Gulf State other than Muscat. This I understand is (a) because none of the States have shore batteries with which to reply and (b) none of them is fully independent. I do not know which of these reasons is considered the stronger one. I do not consider that any harm has been done by the salute to the country fired by the 'H.C.Dickson' at Kuwait and do not press for any representation regarding it. E. P. 5. With reference to the visit of the USS. 'Toledo' to Bahrain I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from Mr. Bailey, the U.S.A. Consul, Dhahran, and of my reply to it.

C/381 dated the 18th May, 1947 from the Political Agent, Kuwait to A he Secretary to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. Subject: - United States Naval Visit. Sir, ^ I have the honoijr;/to refer- to the correspondence resting with my telegram No$£72 dated the 14th May, 1947 and to inform you that Mr. Bufdett and Cpmmander Henderson in their interview with me oh 'the *8th May, told me that according to American Naval instructions the head of a State was entitled to a salute of 21 guns, and that, in their view, the Bhaikh was the head of a State. 2. For obvious reasons I considered it undesirable that the Shaikh should receive a salute of 21 guns, but I had to reason with them at length to persuade them to give him only 11. In the course of the argument I told them that the United States of America recognised, explicitly or implicitly, our special position in Kuwait, and that the United Kingdom signature covered Kuwait in such international agreements as the Chicago Civil Aviation Convention and the Bretton Woods Agreement: that the foreign relations of Kuwait were conducted through us, and that this put the Shaikh on a different footing to the head of an independent otate. I told them further that the Shaikh had never received more than 11 guns (there is, in fact, no record of what salute was given him by French Warships on their visits here before the war) and that if only 11 guns were fired it would cause no complications, but that if 21 guns were given there would certainly be repercussions. I suggested that, should their Government not agree that an 11 gun salute was sufficient, 21 guns could be fired on the next visit; but that it would be wrong to fire 21 guns in the circumstances without definite instructions to that effect. 3. The Shaikh on his visit to the ship did not wear any uniform or carry a sword (he points out that to do so would, although usual in Bahrain, be quite contrary to custom here), and I told the Americans that, as he was in mufti, they could give him his 11 gun salute or not as they pleased. They replied that they always salute their own Foreign Service Officials in mufti and therefore considered the lack of official dress to be no bar to their firing his salute for the Shaikh. 4. In an Interview some weeks before with another United States, Vice-Consul, Mr. Schott, I Informed him that the ship should not w salute the flag” by firing 21 guns on arrival as Kuwait had no saluting-battery with which to reply. The United States Consulate in Basra were unable to contact the ship between that interview and her arrival to give her this information and she did, in fact, salute the flag with 21 guns. The salute was not, however, very clearly audible and has not so far as is known caused any comments.Shaikh of Kuwait 11 guns 7 guns Shaikh of Bahrain 11 guns 7 6 uns Shaikh of Qatar 7 guns Skaikh of Abu Dhabi 5 guns 3 guns Shaikh of Debai 5 guns Shaikh Juma of Debai 1 gun Shaikh of Sharjah 5 guns Shaikh of Ajman Shaikh of Umm al Qawain Shaikh of Has al Khaimah Shaikh of iv alba Shaikh fiegent of Kalba V 3 guns 3 o^ns 3 guns 3 guns 3 guns 3 guns.833/V&lt;aldo E Balley/hg -I. inJ t * .jt i9 !

Th&lt; O. , O. x.i^. , Political Resident, Persian GuIiP To His Majesty's Secretary of State for India India Office, LONDON. Sir I have the honour to submit the following report regarding the recent visits of vessels of the United States Navy to the Persian Gulf. The cruiser ’’Toledo' arrived at Bahrain on the 10th May and left on the 13th for Ras Tanura. The I destroyer 'H. C. Dickson' arrived at Kuwait on the 11th May and left on -the 14th for Basra and the destroyer 'Hyman' arrived at Muscat on the 9th May and left on the 12th for Abadan. Mil the vessels are en route to the Far mast where, it is believed, the 'Toledo', which was commissioned as recently as October 1946, is to be the flag ship of the itmerican fleet. Admirals Conolly and Glover with their staffs arrived by air from London at Bahrain on the evening of the 11th I ay and Admiral Conolly hoisted his flag in the 'Toledo'. I understand he is leaving her at Ras Tanura and that he is proceeding from there to Tehran. x. Bailey, the American Consul at Dhahran, came to Bahrain a few days before the 'Toledo’s' visit and he and Lieutenant Commander Porter, who appears to be a sort of unofficial Naval Attache in the guise of an employee of the oahrain Petroleum Company, layed a prominent part in the arrangement of formalities. At Bahrainpage 2. EXT 5 3. At Bahrain the 10th Il^y^as largely taken up with the exchange, of officia l calls. I'A e Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, gave a cocktail party and I gave a dinner party for Captain Detzer of the 'Toledo 11 and some of his officers. On the 11th May His Highness the Shaikh gave a dinner party which ,vas attended by the two Admirals and members of their staffs and Captain Detzer and a number of officers from the 'Toledo'. On the morning of the 12th the two Admirals and members of their staffs called on me and on the Shaikh and I returned their call on the 'Toledo'. I entertained the Admirals and members of their staffs to lunch. Over a hundred of the local mercantile community visited the cruiser on invitations distributed by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. In the afternoon the Shaikh with twenty of his relatives was entertained to tea on board. The Admirals and members of their staffs together with Captain Detzer and some officers of the 'Toledo' were enter tained to a cocktail party by Hr. Pelly, the Political Agent, Bahrain, and to a dinner party by Hr. Russell Brown, the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. No parties for Europeans or Americans were given on board presumably because there were so many parties ashore, and many of the European community were disappointed at not being given an opportunity of visiting the cruiser. 4. Throughout the visit of the 'Toledo' all courtesies were most meticulously observed and it is under stood that special instructions had been received from the Gtate Department to this effect. On the 12th May, the anniversary of His Majesty's Coronation, the ship was dressed and a Royal Salute fired. The only protocol difficulty that threatened at one time was concerned with the salute to His Highness Shaikh Salman, as the American Naval officers were unable to understand why as an independent Ruler he should not receive a salute of twenty one guns. They were, however persuaded to • • • •(g) page tV'&gt; persuaded to limit iiis salute 'fia^leven guns and they fired this salute on two occasions oners'' Then he returned the Captain's call on the 10th and again when he left after the tea party, which was re;arded as a return of the Admiral's call, on the 12th, During the dinner party at the Shaikh's Palace at • .afaa on the 11th Admiral Conolly once referred to him in his presence as His ajesty although I had been con sistently talking of him as His Highness. fhe weather throughout the stay of the 'Toledo' was unpleasantly hot but in spite of this all officers and other ranks when ashore appeared throughout their stay in spotless white. One of the' Admiral's staff admitted that he had changed his uniform five times in one day. 5. At Kuwait and muscat calls were exchanged and arties given on the same lines as at Bahrain. mr. ^urdett, the American Vice Consul, Basra, and Commander Henderson, Naval Attache at the American embassy, Baghdad, were present at Kuwait during the visit of the 'H.

All dined with the Shaikh the same evening. On the fol lowing day the Shaikh lunched on board and was give n a sa lute of elev e n guns on departure. The Political Agent reports that he had some difficulty in persuading the Commander not to give him a salute of twenty one guns. On the 13th may the members of the Cubah family and the principal merchants visited the ship. 6. The 'Hyman' saluted the country on arrival at muscat and the shore batteries replied.

I understood from him that he had suggested something of the sort a considerable time ago but that he had. only recently been informed of the , decision to despatch the vessels and had been instructed to be present himself at very short notice. The main object of the display is, I imagine, to show that there is power behind American enterprise in the Gulf and the visit of the • 'Toledo' to has Tanura is probably the outstanding feature of the programme. The Admiral and I agreed that one good result to be looked for from the visit of the warships was that it would make it clear to all concerned that Great Lritain and the United States of America were co-operating in this area. Although for this reason the visit is to be I welcomed, it may well strengthen a tendency, of which there Imuxo already seen some faint signs, amongst the .alers of the Gulf States to regard the United States of America as the power best able to assist them and to regret concessions which they have in the past given to Great Britain. 8.

My dear Gihson, May I refer to your letter of 19th April, No.P.Z.2363/38 concerning the request of the Bahrain Government that in future visits of all foreign warships other than French should he strongly discouraged. The request covers all foreign warships other than French and it may he that the Bahrain Government are thinking not only of Japanese, hut also of possible Persian visits. Legally any state has the right to forhid the visits of foreign warships to its ports and this right is in fact exercised hy certain states, notahly Japan. It has, however, heen our consistent policy for some time to encourage the principle that, as a matter of courtesy, visits of warships should normally he allowed, provided a reasonable notification in advance is given. In general it is clearly to our advantage to continue this policy, even if v/e do dislike some of the visits paid. In the Sata case, although we did take steps to discourage the visit we did not actually forhid it, and in the event of any further visits of Japanese warships to Bahrain or other Persian Gulf ports being notified, we should propose to take similar action. V/e failed to prevent the visit of the Sata largely because the vessel was already on her way before action was taken, and we feel that if another case arises there would he a reasonable i: J. chance of success if action were taken at once. The Japanese, who refuse entry altogether for warships to a/ P. Gibson ? Esq., India Office, S.W.l. (2 a considerable number of their ports, are not very strongly placed for insisting on visiting Bahrain. We should like to suggest therefore that the reply to the Bahrain Government proposed by Weightman should be somewhat amplified, by including an explanation of the legal position and of the reasons for not asserting the right to refuse permission in normal cases, adding that H.M.Government have noted their desire to avoid future visits of Japanese and other foreign warships (except French) to Bahrain, but that they will realise that the steps which can be taken to discourage such visits must depend upon the circumstances of each case. I am sending a copy of this letter to Brenan. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) E. A. SEAL.3p v ft' Minute Paper. P Z 2Joig / [z m j POLITICAL / Mr. Walton, 1/ You will remember the visit of the French cruiser “Bougainville” to Ras-al-Khaimah in 1935 (P.Z.3531/35 etc.). As a result of this incident, Colonel Fowle was apprehensive this year when the French sloop “d'Iberville” paid a visit to the Gulf that a similar incident might occur. We accordingly asked the Foreign Office to get the Embassy to remind the French Government that should the“d'Iberville' wish to call at any place in the Persian Gulf other than Muscat, Bahrein or Koweit, a previous reference should be made to the Political Resident (P.Z.609/37). A further cause for anxiety ^ that the sloop cengr iefc £an aeroplane, and it was feared that some flight* might be undertaken in this area. You will see from the attached letter from Bushire dated 28th March that in the event the ship did not do anything exceptional or embarrassing, and that her activities were curtailed by the fact that her Captain was ill throughout the trip.tne Governor, and courtesy calls witn tiis Majesty’s Consul (I was away on tour) and His Majesty’s vice consul, and a- excnange of nospitality took place between tne Residency and tne 'd 1 Iberville**. 4.

It has since been ascertained that neither was the political Resident in the Persian Gulf approach* direct* £• Owing: to the backward and primitive conditions at present existing on most part&amp; of the Truoial Coast it is the policy of His Majesty's Government and of the Govorm-ient of India to prevent, where possible, direct contact/contact between tbe Trucial sheikhs and the subjects of foreign powers, ana indeed to dis courage visits to the Truoial coast even by Briti. suojecta. If the French (iovernraent had applied for peraiBsion for the H Bougainville' to visit Ra8-al-£faaimah, His Majesty^ government might, in pursuance of this policy, have felt unable to accede to their request* In this connexion I mould draw your attention to the Exclusive Agreement of March 1892 between His Majesty's dovernaent and all the Trucial SheiJths, by which the latter under took, each in identical terms, that they would 'on no account enter into any agreement or 'correspondence with any power other than the 'British Government'. Hie Majesty's Government are thus responsible for their foreign relations and I may add that in respect of naval visits His Majesty's Government's relatione with the Trucial Sheikhdoms are on precisely the same footing as their relations with the Sheikhdoms of koweit and Bahrain. Permission for a naval visit to the latter sheikhdoms was in the caseof the 'Boug&amp;inTille” ciuly sought by the /reach Government, and was granted by His Majesty's Government* 4* The vieit of the 'Bougainville' to Ra&amp;~al~£haiz&amp;ah does not appear t~ have lea to any untoward consequences, and His Majesty's Governjaent do not wise to attach to it an importance wnich in itself it aoes not merit* Hone the less they feel some apprehension lest the unannounced visit of the 'Bougainville' should be invoiced as a precedent for a sub* sequent and similar visit to a Trucial Sheikhdom by a vessel of war belonging to another and possibly a less frienaly po//er than /ranee, such as might, in such an area, result at least in a most embarrassing situation even if it did not lead to more serious repercussions elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. 5. Hj.s Majesty’s Government accordingly V* feel it desirable that the /rench Government should, amicably ana informally, be made aware of the position as eet forth above, and should be invited to enquire beforehand, on any future occasion/occasion when they may contemplate senalog a warship into the Persian tfulf with the intention o£ calling at any Truoial port, whether His Majesty’s Government would have any objection to a visit by such vessel to any such port# 6. I shall be glad therefore, should you see no objection, if you will take a suit able opportunity of approaching the French Government in this sense in as informal and frienuly a manner as possible, taking care however not to leave them under the impression that His Majesty’s Government wish ±n any way to make the visit of the ’•Mougainville' to Has-al-khaimah a subject of complaint# If you think it desirable to acquaint the French Government with the terms of the Sxolusivs Agreement of 169S, you may do so#P.z.3531/35 fA- Draft Paper.

From the Nakhoda the following further information was gained. He was at Ras al Khaimah when the French sloop ’’BOUGAINVILLE” visited there early in February. The Sheikh did not go off to the ship and when several officers landed in uniform they were met ashore by a representative of the Sheikh, who asked why they had come. Their reply is not known, but the Sheikh’s representative told them that if they needed anything they could have it, otherwise their presence was undesirable. The Nakhoda was asked if the nationality of the sloop was realised, and he replied that this definitely was so.Z. 2264/35 —^ !r, ' No. 4 of 1935. Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary.

(a) on 22nd February 1935 the French Warship Bougainville visited Kuwait with Rear Admiral Rivet of the French Eastern Mediterranean Squadron on board. (b) The usual official calls, return calls, lunches and banquets took place, as befitted the visit of a high naval officer of a foreign power. (c) After the Shaikh had paid his official call on board the warship in company with the Political Agent, he was shov/n round the ship by the Admiral in person. The Shaikh later remarked to the writer that while he was impressed by the smart new appearance of the ship, and especially by the twin ^ DIESSE1L ,, engines with which she was equipped, he did not think the general turn out of the crew and their appearance could compare with that of British Sailors. ^d) Both Admiral Rivet and the five Staff officers who accompanied him appeared to know everything that was to be known about the Persian Gulf and the interior of Arabia, and most of them had read the standard English works on Bin Saud (including the works of modern authors like A.T. Wilson, Philby, Thomas, Captain Armstrong etc.) Indeed the Admiral went so far as to say that our English books with their excellent maps, were far superior to anything published (especially the maps) on the Continent of Europe. (e) The following points of interest were mentioned SECRETby Rear Admiral Rivet in the course of a long informal talk, vhiich he had with the writer in the Agency:- (i} He was amused at the attitude of the Arabs at Ras el Khaima , who not only asked if he would sell them arms, but appeared to think that Prance and Angland were on bad terms (a good example of the ignorance existing on the Trucial Coast). / (ii) He had desired to visit Shargah but his superiors had refused permission. (iii) He discussed at length the anchorage of Ras Tanura, and made several shrewed observations as to its future possibilities. (iv) He said he knew Fuad Hamza (a Syrian Druse and French subject he called him) and the latter had promised to arrange a meeting between the king and himseif on his return visit to Jedda . (v) He appeared to know all about Bin Saud’s I blockade of Kuwait, and of IRAQ'S obvious desire (his words) to gain possession of the principality. He laughingly compared Kuwait to the beautiful young lady whom both IRAQ, and Bin Saud v/ere anxious to marry. (vi) He knew a Mrs. Marks (now Mrs. Fletcher) and asked my opinion of her. (vii) He enquired about Hoffuf , and the various routes into the interior. (viii) He opined that Bin Saud had done well to make the peace he had done with Yemen , and if the Campaign had gone he would have been beaten. (ix) He said that in the view of his government as soon as Bin Saud died his Empire would collapse and there would once again be chaos in Arabia, until such time as another strong man arose and got a grip of things (if ever such a thing could take place again).3. (x) He hoped that a French v/arship would visit the Gulf every two years from now on, though he seemed to take some pains to explain that France had no real interests in the Persian Gulf. (xi) He discussed the 'Cairo Broadcasting Station' and 'Arab Newspapers' generally and gave it as his opinion that England and France should keep a very careful watch on what was dessimated, as newspapers especially were capable of doing an enormous amount of harm seeing that Arabian reaaers regularly believed that anything they said in print must be true. The Bougainville left Kuwait at 4 a.m. on the E3rd February.P.Z.2206/35 « / « Extract from Diary No.l of Consulate for Khuzistan, Ahwaz, for the month of January 1935. 5. Naval Visits .

Salutes were exchanged between H.M.Ships and the Persian Navy. On the 5th His Majesty 1 s Vice Consul and Mra Chauncy called on Naib-Sarhang Bayandor to bid Mrs. Bayandor farewell on her departure for the United Kingdom. She left Basra for London by Imperial Airways on the 10th. During the call Naib Sarhang Bayandor stated that he hoped to exchange salutes at Mohammerah as H.M.S.'Hawkins” passed and visits at Abadan when the flagship arrived there. On the 6th Captain and Mrs. Chauncy visited the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, in H.M.S.'Shoreham' at Basra. During the morning Captain Chauncy was introduced to the Commander-in-Chief on board the flagship. Naib-Sarhang Bayando^s hopes were made known to him and he indicated that he was ready to fall in with any proposal calculated to promote and extend good relationships with the Persian Navy. Accordingly on the afternoon of the 10th when H.M.S. 'Hawkins' and H.M.S.'Shoreham' passed Mohammerah a salute of 21 guns was fired and the Persian National anthem played by H.M.S.'Hawkins'. This was replied to by a similar salute from H.I.M.S.'Babr'. The Persian Navy then saluted the flag of the Commander-in-Chief and H.M.S.'Hawkins' replied. On arrival at Abadan that evening calls were exchanged between an officer of the2 At 9 a.m. on the 11th Naib Sarhang Bayandor called upon the flagship. In the absence of the Commander-in-Chief who had gone to Tehran, he was received by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and Captain Phillips, the Commander-in-Chief 1 s Chief of Staff. During the morning His Majesty’s Yice Consul called and he accompanied Captain Phillips to the Governorate to call on the Governor. The Senior Naval Officer and Captain Phillips then returned Naib Sarhang Bayandor’s call. This, at the Persian Naval Commander’s request, was done ashore in the Naval Office at Mohammerah. The Governor returned the call on board H.M.S. 'Hawkins” at noon. The Commandant and Officers of the Persian Navy gave a dinner party on board the 'Babr' that night. The Officers of the Persian Navy were at Home to the Officers of H.M.S. 'Hawkins' and 'Shoreham' on board H.I.M.S. 'Palang' on Saturday 12th. That night the Commander-in-Chief, who had just arrived back from Tehran, gave a large dinner party. At both this and the one on H.I.M.S.'Babr', the healths of His Majesty the King and of the Shah of Persia were toasted. After dinner the Commander-in-Chief, Captain and Officers of H.M.S.'Hawkins' were at Home to the British Community and the Persian Navy. About 300 persons were present. On the morning of 13th Naib Sarhang Bayandor called unofficially on the Commander-in-Chief and H.M.S.'Shoreham' was at Home to the officers of the Persian Navy. His Majesty’s Vice Consul also gave a small luncheon party in the Consulate. In the evening a Concert was provided by H.M.S.'Hawkins' in the Anglo Persian Oil Company’s Concert hall, preceded by a dinner party given by the General Manager. Throughout the visit of the Flagship games and matches of all descriptions were arranged by the staff of the Anglo Persian Oil Company between the ships’ company and themselves.At 2 p.m. on the 14th H.M.S.'Hawkins' and 'Shoreham' left for Kuwait thereby terminating a visit which was thoroughly enjoyed at least by all ashore and which was marked by the extremely cordial relations between the British and Persian Navies, H.M.S .'Bideford' visited Abadan on the 24th to take oil and left on completion.t i* Notes.

The Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah is the somewhat anti-British Sheikh who adopted such an obstinate attitude in regard to the R.A.F. petrol barge at Ras al Khaimah, and who always avoids calling on board British sloops when they visit his sheikhdom. In view of this it seems particularly undesirable that he should have relations with foreign warships ap^such relations, as pointed out in Mr. Laithwaite’s note, contain possibilities of embarrassment for H.M.G. Our - general/ 3330 1000 12.34I general policy has hitherto been to exclude prospective oil concessionaires from the Trucial Coast area, and it would be extremely awkward if the Sheixh of Has al Khairnah were to enter into ^ ■- any sort of agreement with foreigners behind our backs, even though an agreement of this kind could of course be vetoed by H.M.G. It might be worth dropping a hint informally to Colonel Fowle that visits of foreign warships to the Trucial Coast should in future be discouraged and, if possible, prevented. Secretary. Military Dept. The itinerary of the ’'Bougainville” furnished to us by the French Government did not, I think, include any reference to a prospective visit at Has al Khaimah?

Secret. No.3 of 1935. Extract from Intelligence Report of the Political Agent,Bahrain,for the period 1st to 15th February 1935. 21. TRUCIAL COAST . (1). Has al Khaimah . (a). The 'Bougainville' visited Has al Khaimah on her way to Bahrain. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah did not come on board, but met the Admiral on the beach with some five hundred followers. The following conversation, as recounted by the Admiral is not without humour and is also possibly an useful indication of the Shaikhs state of mind:- Shaikh: Are you British or French? Admiral: I am French . Shaikh(hopefully): Are you at war with the British? Admiral: No, we are friends. Rave you any arms: will you give me some? Shaikh: Admiral: I have arms for my Ship, but none to give away. Shaikh: Well - will you sell me some? The Admiral led the Political Agent to infer that he had not sold his arms to the Shaikh. (b) An individual who was sent to Ras al Khaimah for that purpose reports that eight Officers and a Somali Interpreter landed at Ras al Khaimah. He confirms that the Shaikh met the party on the beach with horses and took them to his Fort. They were there for about one and s haiff- hours and tea and coffee was served. The Shaikh then told two of his nephews to take the party round the bazaar. They returned to the Fort to say goodbye to the Shaikh, who is rumoured to have given them a letter in which (so it* it is presumed locally) he asked them to arrange for a geologist to see if fresh water can he had at Ras al Khaimah. This fits in with a wish expressed by the Shaikh in November 1934 for an examination of the hills behind Ras al Khaimah for water and oilfto.C 644/120/17 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 29th January, 1935.

The British Government was concerned that such visits should obtain prior permission, particularly visits to the Trucial Coast in the 1930s, where British officials cited the Exclusive Agreement of March 1892, and the 'primitive conditions' to be found on the Trucial Coast at that time (folio 128).The file contains correspondence from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Office, and other British officials; intelligence reports; and correspondence with the governments of France and the United States of America.The file covers: visit of the French warship
                           Bougainvilleto Bahrain, Kuwait and Ras al Khaimah in 1935; visit of the French warship
                           d'Ibervilleto Bahrain, Kuwait and Aden in 1937; the cancellation of a visit by the
                           d'Ibervilleto the Persian Gulf in 1939; visits of US warships (including USS
                           Toledo, USS
                           Hyman, and the aircraft carrier USS
                           Valley Forge) to the region in 1947-48; and the question of national salutes.The French language content of the file consists of approximately five folios of diplomatic correspondence (untranslated).There are no papers in the file dated 1940-45.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Ras al Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Visits</topic></subject><subject><topic>Warships</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001ba#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
