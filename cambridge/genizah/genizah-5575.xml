                  <summary>Letter sent by the leaders of the Jewish community in Ashqelon, who are currently in Egypt seeking help for their community. They describe the difficult circumstances in Ashqelon a few months after the Crusaders' capture of Jerusalem. The fortified city of Ashqelon had not yet fallen, but the residents were struggling to cope with an influx of refugees and the need to make large payments to the Crusaders to ransom back Jewish captives - men, women and children - as well as books and scrolls pillaged from the synagogues of the Holy Land. Despite the terrible circumstances, they take solace in the fact that that the Crusaders appeared not to have mistreated the women. There are notes by the writers and forwarders of the letter in the right-hand margin on verso, including its writer Isaiah ha-Kohen b. Maṣliaḥ, David b. Solomon, and Ḥanina b. Mansur b. ʿUbayd.</summary>

            <p> News still reaches us that among those who were redeemed from the Franks and remained in Ashkelon some are in danger of dying of want. Others remained in captivity, and yet others were killed before the eyes of the rest, who themselves were killed afterwards with all manner of tortures; [for the enemy murdered them] in order to give vent to his anger on them. We did not hear of a single man of Israel who was in such plight without exerting ourselves to do all that was in our power to save him.</p>
            <p>The Most High has granted opportunities of relief and deliverance to individual fugitives, of which the first and most perfect instance – after the compassion of Heaven – has been the presence in Ashkelon of the honourable sheikh Abu l-Fadl Sahl son of Yusha’ son of Shay‘a (may God preserve him), an agent of the Sultan (may God bestow glory upon his victories), whose influence is great in Alexandria where his word is very much heeded. He arranged matters wisely and took great pain in securing the ransom; but it would require a lengthy discourse to explain how he did it. But he could only ransom some of the people and had to leave the others. In the end, all those who could be ransomed from them were liberated, and only a few whom they kept remained in their hands, including a boy of about 8 years of age, and a man, known as […] the son of the Tustari’s wife. It is reported that the Franks urged the latter to embrace the Christian faith of his own free will and promised to treat him well, but he told them, how can I become a Christian and be left in peace by them [the Jews], who had disbursed on his behalf a great sum. Until this day these captives remain in their [Franks] hands; as well as those who were taken to Antioch, but these are few; and not counting those who abjured their faith because they lost patience as it was not possible to ransom them, and because they despaired of being permitted to go free.</p>
            <p>We were not informed, praise be to the Most High, that the accursed ones who are called Ashkenazim [Germans] violated or raped women, as did the others.</p>
            <p>Now, among those who have reached safety are some who escaped on the second and third days following the battle and left with the governor who was granted safe conduct; and others who, after having been caught by the Franks, remained in their hands for some time but escaped in the end; these are but few. The majority consists of those who were ransomed. To our sorrow, some of them ended their lives under all kind of suffering and affliction. The privations which they had to endure caused some of them to leave for this country without food or protection against the cold, and they died on the way. Others in a similar way perished at sea; and yet others, after having arrived here safely, became exposed to a ‘change of air’; they came at the height of the plague, and a number of them died. We had, at the time, reported the arrival of each group.</p>
            <p>And when the aforementioned honoured sheikh arrived, he brought a group of them, the bulk of those who had reached Ashkelon; he spent the Sabbath and celebrated Passover with them on the way in the manner as is required by such circumstances. He contracted a private loan for the sum that he had to pay the camel drivers and for their maintenance on the way, as well as the caravan guards and for other expenses, after having already spent other sums of money, which he did not charge to the community. All this is in addition to the money that was borrowed and spent in order to buy back 230 volumes, 100 codices and 8 Torah scrolls. All these are communal property and are now in Ashkelon.</p>
            <p>The community, after having disbursed about 500 dinars for the actual ransom of the individuals, for maintenance of some of them and for the ransom, as mentioned above, of the sacred books remained indebted for the sum of 200 dinars. This is in addition to what has been spent on behalf of those who have been arriving from the beginning until now, on water and other drinks, medical treatment, maintenance, and, in so far as possible, clothing. If it could be calculated how much this has cost over such a long period, the sum would indeed be great.</p>
            <p>Had the accepted practice been followed, that is, of selling three Jewish captives for 100 (dinars), the whole available sum would have been spent for the ransom of only a few. However, the grace of the Lord, may His Name be exalted, and his ever-ready mercy, has been bestowed upon these wretched people…</p>
