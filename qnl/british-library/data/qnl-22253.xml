Small quantities of wheat ana barley for the con sumption of private persons have been allowed to come into the town. Apart from this some wheat and barley is also being brought in by peasants who avoid the octroi posts at the gates of the town. As a result, the prices of wheat and barley have come down slightly to rials 32.00 and 22.00 res pectively per maund of 4 kilos. It is said a fair amount of wheat and barley is stocked in the villages around Bandar Abbas and it is hoped that this will now be brought in as a consequence of good harvest prospects.

This practicall' u ^ e Pro^i^able entrepot trade* largely in piecegoods, with India and the irucial ^Gast. By an unlucky turn^of fortune, the overthrown of Pahlevi and the freeing of trade hrought no relief to t^Lsiim* since the new freedom swept Ban dar Abbas into prominence once more as the chief port of the south-east. freer trade has ad so cut away the standby of smuggling which ^ishm merchants relied on to easfc the war situation of dwindling trade. 12. ihe town is not starving. There is cultivation close by and ikie xatiam still some trade. The fishermen catch — 'mumakh 1 (the’sardines• canned by the Bandar Abbas factory, which are usually collected each evening by the hired laun ches v/orking for the latter) and do some small barter trade with the ships of the assembling convoys. 13. The sugar ration is 350 grams (in Hormuz it is 300 grams' though the ration in Bandar Abbas is 500 grams. These figures may be of int 61 ‘ eat to the Middle fast Supply Centre* since 500 grams per person of the whole population is the ostensiole basis of Persia’s claims to sugar imports. in fact* there are many places where less than 5Q0'grams is given, or where the issue of sugar unaccountably ceases for a period* or where the number of coupons issued is consider ably less than the local population. 14. for six months there has been no bakhshdar of Qishm, more than one governor designate having successfully avoided - joining a post so unpromising in irregular income. Salakh 15. Beference paragraph 6 of diary for I6th-3lst December, 1943, a small detachment of the Transjordan frontier force has been senti to Salakh on the southern coast of c^ishm. The party will reconnoitre roads in the central and southern part of the island and will endeavour to discover if the landing ground shown at Basidu in the 1942 Aeronautical Edition of the ’million’ sheet is serviceable. 16. An R.a.F. officer jx^o visited the landing ground at Salakh considered that extensive repairs would be required to make it serviceable for use by anti-locust planes. it has been decided not to make the landing ground serviceable.- 3 - Hormuz J:?. 1101 ' ve P little activity on Hormuz island. reoe ^ 1 y continued in the mines, in spite or nefr?v P^nrm ? 983at i 0 ? v of . a 5 iand for r cd oxide.

The G-ovemor was meanwhile ordered oo abstain from interfering in election matters. nqai ioizaffari, an in spector sent 'by the Governor-General * Kerman, (acting under orders from the Ministry of the Interior) arrived on izth Janu ary. The Governor refused to co-operate with the latter, claiming that he had no proper authority and that the author ised inspector was being sent from Tehran by the Ministry of the Interior. 21. Meanwhile the unpopularity of the Governor among certain sections of the townspeople increased. There is no doubt that he has made money freely in his two months tenure of office to date, and that his hot tamper made him a number of enemies. There were allegations of assault made by some shopkeepers which, though hard to credit at first sight, were vouched for to H.M.Consul by respectable and impartial citi zens, including the sitting member for Bandar A^bas, Kaji Mu shir, who in this matter had no apparent axe to grind. 22. This unpopularity culminated on the 14th January when a mass deputation of about 200 local shopkeepers and traders visited the Consulate and made complaints of assault and ex tortion against the Governor. There was a partial closure of shops in the bazaar as a protest. The leaders of the deputation declared that they had obtained no redress of their grievances against the Governor and declared (a little half heartedly, it must be admitted) their intention of taking •bast’ in the Consulate, to escape from the oppression and expected vengeance of the Governor. H.M.Consul referred the members of the deputation to their own authorities, advising them to re-open shops and conduct themselves in an orderly fashion. The deputation left quietly. Some of them were threatened, both on the way to and from the Consulate, by the\ police, who apparently had orders to prevent the crowd reach ing the Consulate. A telegram of protest against the Gover nor was later sent by the deputation to Tehran. - £0(SJ ! - 4 - ^3. It is prolDatle that this deputation was at least not discouraged hy the G-eiiahdari party. ^n the other hand it was not an irresponsible election move lacking foundation in fact. However, opportunity was taken ^to warn the Gellah- dari party for the future that, though the complaints of the present deputation appeared to he founded in fact and had been presented in an orderly fashion, this Consulate would not countenance election methods based on unruly demonste*- tions, least of all demonstrations directly involving this Consulate. 24. At the end of the fortnight the Governor was still re fusing to receive the inspector sent by the Govern or-General and insisting that he was awaiting another inspector from Tehran.

Levies, Jask, flew to Bandar ibbas to consult H.tf.Consul on the question of whether families should be allowed to accompany the Arab Levy company which is to replace the present Baluch company at Jask. H. i. Consul informed tne 0.0. that it was plainly undesirable for the families to come to Jask. ihe numbers Involved might be three hundred or more which would tax the small Jask food supply as well as provide a major accommo dation problem. Smallpox was still rife in Jask. In addition it was well known that a large number of the '•Arab* levies were of fersian extraction ana Persian subjects and the settlement of wives and families in Jask might raise questions of national status and travel documents which would be better left dormant. 69. The 0.0. had also received instructions to inquire whether it would be nossible to recruit men for the levies in the Bandar Abbas area. He was informed that under the prosent agreements with Persia this was quite out of the question. fish Canniin; factory 70. After making a good start and increasing the production of sardines very substantially i^ bhe first month of the season (Beoember) the production of the factory steadily decreased. There is a shortage of olive oil lor which a representative of the hepartmont of Commerce and Industry is said to be scouring Palestine. But the shortage was foreseen over a year ago and that it has hot be^n met ap pears to be yet another instance of lack of * oresight and inefficiency on the part of the Persian authorities, ihe Danish experts, when pressed for details by H. .Consul, have accused the heads of the department of a * go slow* policy combined with a desire to make money by holding up the dis tribution of sardines in order to keep the price high. •‘•no retail price is certainly quite extraordinarily high, rials 22.00 for a small tin, and far out of proportion to the coat of production. 71. It is not known by H.M.Consul whether British supplies authorities have any Interest in the prodtioe of this factory (one consignment of 100,000 tins was bought last year by the Army). The factory is capable of producing daily several thousand tins of sardines, a good portable food, one would have thought, for arnies# Xt is not known vhethei British supervision of the factory has bean considered as a means / t.fs 1 *, *4 to inaroaso production. K.^.Consul ‘believes that the Danish technicians are anxious to do a good Jot of work f and are sincere and justified in complaints of inefficient and venal superiors. If* as may he the case* it is the supposedly hig cost of production which has deterred Allied supplies author ities from becoming interested in the buying of sardines, H.??.Consul has good reason to believe that the figures or production costs adduced by the Persian authorities are, to say the least, most inaccurate. 72. The fish expert, Mr fynn Tyndberg Hansen, who has had no experience of the process concerned, recently produced to H.F.Consul something very close to kippered herring but which requires to be rather more smoked and salted. He is being encouraged to see whether he can obtain regular supplies of the fish concerned which, though not our North Sea herring, is a fish of the herring family. If it is possible to devel op canning of this fish (which would surely be a great favour ite with British troops) the problem of shortage of olive oil i which has reduced sardine production to very small proportions would be solved. The Election 73. The Crovernor, Agai C-urgani, suddenly left Bandar Abbas in dramatic circumstances on the night of the 1st. Without informing officials, friends, or even servants, ho stepped into a lorry late at night and left, it was later discovered, for Kerman en rout© to Tehran. It was immediately rumoured that the Governor was leaving to avoid execution of the order of investigation received by the local court in answer to the complaints of assault and extortion made to *eiiran (paragraph There may have been something in this ra.our but one motive was certainly that of leaving the ^ellahdari party in the dark about his intentions in order to keep one move ahead in the feverish string-pulling at the centre which is the chi* feature of this election. However, this Consulate had al ready informed H.M.Minister that the ^vqthov 9 s open champion ship of Kisbahzadeh and his embroilment in bitter disputes in Bandar Abbas made him quite unsuited to continue as Gov ernor and supervisor of the elections. By the end of the fortnight lt~se&amp;ned unlikely that Aqai Gurgani would return. I is departure sent the stock of the ' ellahdari party soaring, but it anffered a slight setback when Aqai furbati, the pro- Misbahzadeh Deputy-Governor of Minab, was instructed by the Ministry of the Interior to act as (^ovemor in the face of orders from the Gove nor-General, • Kenuan, wdcbc thaii Aqai Mosan- enzadeh (paragraph 56) should take Gurgaui^s place. 74. No inspector has yet arrived from Tehran (paragraph 45) and what new move the hisbahzadeh party will cause their powerful friends in Tehran to make is sti.ll unknown. «ow that six long iaonths have just closed since the election proceedings began, it is earnestly to be hoped that the inde- fatigable~oau&amp;idates and their friends will begin to tire of their tortuous intriguing.

During his stay at Jask H.M.Consul mat leading local officials with the exception of the Deputy Governor, Sayed 3ia Hejazi, who was sick the whole time and who, it is under stood, is almost a chronic invalid. H.M.Consul was very unfavourably impressed with the majority of the officials, who were of a very low calibre and appeared to do little ex cept to qualify as adepts in corruption and coercion. The food situation was somewhat bettor than H.M.Consul had been led to believe. Barley anil were being sent from Bushire and waravans with rloe and some wheat from Bud- bar and Bashakird were also arriving at not infrequent inter vals. The greatest obstacle to the circulation of Govern ment controlled oommodities is the corruption it local of ficials headed by a band of four - the heads of finance, Polioe, Gendarmerie and Census departments, vho share the illicit profits giving some of their proceeds to tother of ficials in proportion to the harm they assess the official concerned can do them. The methods of intrigue and corrup tion of this group are many and ingenious, but generally speaking they hoard government oommodities and then gradually release them on the open market when scarcity occurs, thus being able to dispose of these goods at anything up to double and treble the Government fixed rate. Corruption in the issue and maintenance of ration coupons is also rife. 271.

Reference paragraph 276 of QLary No. 11, the Municipal Elections began on the 19th and were completed during the N fortnight. The names of the first thirty candidates who secured votes are being sent to Tehran for the selection (sic) of the six members who fora the Municipal Committee* li Is of Interest to note that among the first twelve candidates nine are supporters of Sheikh Abdullah Cellahdari, the recent ly elected Majlis member for Bandar Abbas, while th^e are adherents of Dr Mlsbehsadeh, another election aspirant who withdrew after effecting a compromise with the former*s party. Haji Mokhtar Mushir* the late member, obtained no representation in these elections which is one more indication of his political eclipse in favour of Sheikh Abdullah, whose party is now rapidly obtaining full dominance in Bandar Abbas.$£J4?Uiofc and Philipps visit was *■« ^ofold» first to install the new E.B.R. represen- tatiTe 9 who had been specially selected and brought from Tehran by Lieut, Philipps, in the place of HaJciman (see f aragraph 232 of Diaiy No. 9) and secondly to effect the re ease of Government sugar, tea»xad cotton and pieoegoods held in the Customs* and to expedite, particularly in the case of sugar, their transportation to the interior. Before the departure of these officers from Kerman, they had been fully authorised by Mr Tribon, the new Director General of Finance there, to act on his behalf in any matter deemed necessary, as he was unable to visit Bandar Abbas in person. On arrival it was ascertained that approximately 646 tons sugar, 7 tons piecegoods and 400 kilos tea were held in the Customs. The Director of Customs on Meing asked to release the sugar to the Finance Department maintained he had nlxindt not been.advised of Mr Trlbon f s appointment and had on the contrary received definite orders from the Sugar Distribution Department in Tehran not to release it. However, it was pointed out to him that the head of the local Finance De partment had been apprised of Mr Trlbon^ appointment, that Lieutenants Flliot and Philipps had been given in writing full powers to act on his behalf and that in these oiroum* stances he would be well advised to release anyhow that part of the sugar for which Customs charges had been paid for by the Finance Department. With the help of this Consulate the Director eventually agreed to release 82 tons for which dues had been paid and this is now being sent to the interior. As there is no present shortage of trucks it is hoped that representations will be made for the release of the balance of the sugar, before it is allowed to deteriorate further in the Customs, where some of it has been stored for two years. The matter is being taken up with the Director General of Finance, on the return of the American inspectors to &amp;exiaan* At a meeting of the leading merchants held on the 25th the American officers were informed that there were no com plaints and that since the previous visit of Allied inspec tors of the B.B.R. in the first fortnight of May, 1944, they had experienced no difficulty in clearing their merchandise to the interior and at substantially reduced prices. Security 297. The force of Persian Infantry sent down from Kerman to maintain security on the Bandar Abbas-Hajiabad section of the Kerman road (paragraph 227 of Diary No. 9) hat now been withdrawn and the responsibility for the maintenance of order again devolves solely on the Gendarmerie. This has resulted in a deterioration of the general security of this sector and has again given the Gendarmerie the chance of resorting to their old practice of collusion either direct or indireot with the raiding bands in the vicinity. i The robbery reported on the 14th June (paragraph 277 Diary No. 11) was, it is understood, carried out by Gendarm erie personnel who took little trouble to mask their identity by staging the hold-up in uniform with only theimfaoes covered. Sitwan Shafie of the Bandar Abbas Gendarmerie left for Sarzeh on the 20th to Investigate the robbery and to persuade the followers of Mustafa Lashkari (recently re ported as killed) to cease their depredations in this area on the promise of an amnesty and enrollment in the Gendarm erie ! Food Situation 298. There has been a slight increase in the price of food stuffs, but the general situation renalns satisfactory and... ♦ c • •no shortage is apparent. The harvesting ot the new date crop has oomoienoeo and both the quantity and the qu ali ty of the new dates are reported as above average. Xiafc Fresh dates are now obtainable at rials afc to 3 per kilo. The price of tea fluctuated during the fbrtnight f but rose at the end of the period to rials 240 per kilo. Sugar remained steady at rials 9 9 000 per bag 9 while unadulterated white flour was available at rials 10 per kilo. Fish owing to the hot weather has become scarce and when avail* able costs rials 7 to 8 per kilo. Public Health 299. No oases of smallpo*, typhus or typhoid hare hetm reported from Bandar Abbas 9 whore the incidence of malaria is less than usual. Guinea wom 9 owing to the failure of wells in the close vicinity of the town, is prevalent as the inhabitants prefer to drink stale water collected in reservoirs rather than proceed a mile or two from the town to draw a/consistency. Ho fresh oases of smallpox have been reported from Jack and there has been no increase in the typhoid epidemic in Biaban, which is showing signs of subsiding.

On the 9th Agai Muzaffarl, the Governor of Bandar Abbas, without any previous indioatioi* received a telegram from the Minister of the Interior instructing him to hand over charge of this Govemorate to Agai Hassan Misbah, an ex-Covemor of Bandar Abbas, and to proceed to Lar. The latter, a brother of Dr Misbahzadeh (Tehran newspaper editor and unsuccessful^ Majlis candidate in the recent Bandar Abbas elections), ^ ■proved himself a very poor Governor during his tern of office from January to November, 1943. He showed no administrative ability; he was unreliable, fickle and easily swayed par- where money was the medium oi persuasion used; he conducted the election proceedings with undisguised ^inSf nepotism and complete lack of integrity; he was no fnenc of the Allies and made little attempt to conceal this atti tude. His re-appointment as Governor wss, therefore, con sidered as most undesirable and representations ^to this effect were accordingly made to H.M.Charge d*Affaires, Tehran. 316. On the 10th the Governor received a telegram from / orders2 © orders for his confirmation as Governor of Bandar Afrbas were under issue. Two days later Hassan Mistoaft duly arriv ed from Keiman and the same day the Governor infomed H,M. Consul that a telegram from the Ministry of the Interior (the contents of which had been divulged hy the post and Telegraph officials) had heen delivered to Mishah instruc ting the latter to postpone taking over charge until further orders were received from the Govemo]&gt;General* Keiman. 316. on the 13 th Hass an Mis*bah approached the Governor officially to take over charge of the Governorate, hut Mu- zaffari acting on the strength of Shaikh Ah dull ah f s intima tion of the 10th and the contents of the Ministers telegram to Mishah- on the I2th f refused to hand over charge stating that he was awaiting further instiuctions from Tehran. On the 15th H.M,Consul t Keiman&gt; informed this Consulate that the G-ovemor-General on being asked his views as to Misbah # s appointment to Bandar Abbas, had shared the general opinion that he was not suitable and had recommended that he should be sent to Sahidan instead. On the same day the Governor informed H.M.Consul that he had received a further telegram from dhaikh Abdullah in which the number of the official order instructing him to remain at Bandar Abbas was quoted. Up to the'time of writing there has been no change in the situation; the present Governor awaits official instructions from Tehran, while Hassan Misbah remains at Bandar Abbas in expectation^ of orders from the Governor^-General, Keman, -- a ridiculous position but one, nevertheless, not uncommon to Persia. 317. The present situation is so reminiscent of the election proceedings that it is, with little doubt, a ’♦backwash* 1 of those intrigues, having been instigated for motives of gain, revenge or fulfilment of a past bargain by one or other of the interested parties, who for so long have controlled the details and destiny of local politics from Tehran. WTiatever the ramifications may be, it is hoped that the present in cumbent will be allowed to remain as Governor of Bandar Abbas and that Misbah will be given a post elsewhere to remove him from the confines of Bandar Abbas, where he invariably proves himself a source of trouble. 318. Vide paragraph 296 of Diary No. 12. Aqai Nazirzadeh, Assistant to Mr Tribon, Hirector-General of Finance, Kerman, arrived at Bandar Abbas to accelerate the despatch of Govern ment sugar and pieoegoods to the Interior. He informed H.M. Consul that he had received express instructions to clear these goods from the Customs, except for sufficient stocks of both articles to last Bandar Abbas for six months. He told H.M.Consul he had left 71 bales of piecegoods (which seems inadequate for this District) and asked the latter # s advice regarding the tonnage of stogar that should be retained at Bandar Aubas. H.M. Consul replied that he considered the amount; should be calculated on a 'per capita** basis of the total population according to the present sugar ration scale, which would approximately mean 25-30 tons a month, but, how ever, this was really a matter for the Governor to decide with the help of his advisers in the relevant Finance and Census departments. Nazirzadeh also told H.M.Consul that he had requisitioned all contracted F.B.B. trucks and was allowing no other mer chandise to proceed to Kerman, until the sugar and piecegoods had been despatched -- up to date he had cleared, since his arrival, 185 tons of sugar and 800 bales of piecegoods. Tribal and Political 319. The followers of All Jalal, one of the Taherzai chiefs of Biaban, came to Minab during the period under report to / draw /draw their rations of Government sugar and piecegoods. No untoward incidents tss. have “been reported. $Ecu£iT_y 320. There have heen a few minor rohheries during the fort night on the Bandar Abisas-Lar road in the vicinity of Isin# Trucks for the interior now proceed in convoy escorted hy Gendarmes and in some cases with Persian Infantry as well, and ho incidents have heen reported on the Bandar Abhas- Kercaan road. Pood Situation 321. There has been no change of any note in the food situ ation which continues satisfactory, although prices rauain high. Presh dates are plentiful and the price in view of the increased supply kas dropped. Pish continues to be scarce, and when available cannot be obtained for less than rials 8.00 per kilo. It is reported from Minab that the Government sugar ration is not being properly distributed by the appointed agent, Habib Durustkar, otherwise no shortage of food is being experienced in this area. Wheat and barley are arri ving from Hudan and itudbar and are sold at rials 7.50 and 6.00 per kilo respectively. Pin an cl al 322. The market has been dull (hiring the fortnight and mer chants have been short of cash. Wholesale prices have dropped, prospective buyers are few and in any case merchants are at present retaining their stocks in the hope that such prices will again rise and still enable them to make a sub stantial profit on goods that were originally bought by them at a high cost. Becently the Central Customs authorised the release of all commercial sugar held in stock by the local Customs on the 17th June. This sugar has kow been cleared by the mei&gt; ohants concerned. public Health 325. There has been no change in the general situation: public health in Bandar Abbas and its environments remains satisfactory. Jask is now reported clear of smallpox and the typhoid epidemic in Biaban is receding.

Tours and tMsios 387. Consul on his recent visit to Kerman noticed that the general condition of the road had improved and that re pairs, although still very superficial, were more in Exiot* evidence than during his last brip in May. This was most • noticeable in the Hajiabad area, where heavy rain had fallen causing several bad breaches in the road which, much to his surprise, were expeditiously repaired and although by no means perfect, nevertheless effective, reflecting credit on the maintenance organisation of this particular stretch of the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road. On hie return journey to Bandar Abbas H.M.Consul stopped at lajiabad and called on 3 e tvan Ferdowsi, o.G. Gendarmerie (the senior official present in the absence of the Deputy Governor on leave), who informed him txiat the security of the road in his Jurisdiction had improved and that there had been no recent ,t hoj&lt;j-ups H - information that was confinned by H.F. Consul from other sources. Local Affairs 4 % 38j. Sheikh Abdullah Gellahdari had an audience in Tehran tfi 6 h Il.I.M. The Shall on the 80th. It is not known what was the cause of the interview, but it is believed that the / DeputyDeputy fro/n Bandar took tlie opportunity of ao&lt;iuaintieg the Shah with the haokward oonditions prevaleiiti in this area&gt; and stressed the need of municipal reform and the appointnent of a hotter and higher paid class of official. 389. Some rumours are current that Sheikh Abdullah, by virtue of hie position as a Deputy, is obtaining unilateral trade concessions (such as permission to export dates, hither* to a Persian Crovemment monopoly) beneficial to his own and affiliated businesses in Bandar Abbas# These rumours, how ever, are said to originate from HaJi Ifushir, not only the defeated candidate in the last election but also Sheikh Ab dullah^ commercial rival, and it is therefore more than likely that these contentions, even if fully or partially correct, are activated by personal feelings of jealousy and refenge. 390. It Is understood that the Director of Customs had received orders from lehran not to alloT7 tho release of cotton imported from India by tho Khunji Cotton spinning Mill, as the owners were obtaining such cotton cheaper than tha fixed rate for Persian- grown cotton, and had refused to pay the difference involved between the tw 3 prices to the Persian authorities. 391. On the 23rd the electric supply of the town again failed a?nd it was ascertained later that the shareholders of the Company, had without warning, ordered the closure of the po.ver station, £o as to strengthen their hands in daman- ding an enhanced rate for the new municipal contract, which had teminated in March and which had not been yet renewed. Xmxxx Their action was successful as^t a meeting held at the (rovemorate on the next day to discuss the matter, the Muni cipality agreed to raise the cost of electric currant from rials 3.20 to rials 4.00 per kilowatt and to advance a sum of Rials 50,000.00 to the company against consumption of Current during the last five months. 392. Local landlords who had requested the finance Depart ment to ask Tehran to allot seed wheat and barley fw Bandar Abbas received the reply that 100 tons of wheat and 100 tons of barley had been allocated and would be shipped to Bandar Abbas from ludia and shire respectively. irib.’i and Political 393. Befa enoe paragraph 371 of Diary No. 15, Mir Hasham and Aboas Hussein U.1 have been summoned to Bandar Abbas to deliver their aims to the Persian military authorities on receipt of which the Government will be prepared to grant them an amnesty. 3ecurj ty 394.

Although ’’free 1 * supplies of flour, wheat and barley received both by import and by caravans reaching Bandar Abbas from fche interior, increased considerably during the period under report, there was no reduction in cost and retail prices remained high. / The issueThe issue of 0-ovemment sugar, tea and oigarettes during the fortnight caused a fall in the market prices of these three comiAodities - sugar falling from jfcials 10,000*00 to Rials 8500.00 per hag, tea from rials 300*00 to 300*00 per kilo and cigarettes from rials 10*00 to rials 6*00 per packet of ten* v The general food situation, however, remains satisfac tory as dates are cheap and plentiful (a hamper' crop having been gathered in Min ah this summer) and the supply of fish, with the approaching close of the hot weather, is becoming available and at a cost not beyond the means of the poorer classes. p ublic Health 396. public heaith remains generally good in Bandar Abbas although there has been a slight Increase in the incidence of malarial fever, which however is nomal a‘o this period of the year. • f i. Smallpox has totally subsided in the Jask area, but a number of fresh oases have been reported from Bashakird, where the illness is believed to be on the increase.

At the request of sorte local werohants the Central Customs, Tehran, have sanctioned the export of 2,000 tons °f a £?t; e8 ° r last year’s crop from this area. Haji Mulchtar Mushir, the ex-peputy of Banaar Atbas, was the only person to oppose this doc^sion and protested to Tehran that there would he a scarcity of dates during the ensuing winter if this export *as permitted. However, as the yield of the 13 estimated at 30 to 40 % above average, there will ue little or no demand for last season’s dates, when one n*w crop is released on the market. KaJI Mushir f s action is probably prompted rather by his growing dislike and jealousy of the Oellahaari faction, who are rapidly ousting him from his erstwhile position of influence and 5^Ti uenc0 Ban&lt;i - ar Abbas, that any real interest in the welfare of the community in this area. £aji Mushir having failed to obtain election even on the Municipal Oommittee and finding also that his pOoitu.on a.' a leading factor in local politics is beina f ha + the hope of regaining some of his influence, started propagating for the Hizb-i-Adalat (Justice party) which was first introduced in this area % Abdullah Dashti, the cousin of Sheikh All Dashti Mu8hir s omvtlgn appears to be meeting with little success.•lb ' 2 '* 412.

X ribal and polioi 413. in Sudan a dispute is reported between the representative of the Qavamml-IS'ulk and the cultivators ovez: the collection of dates which led to the former invoking the help of the militaiy from yinab. on the arrival of the lactor there was a clash between them and the cultivators in which some soldiers are reported to have been killed. Servan Ghaffari, 0.0.Troops, Bandar Abbas, has proceeded to Minab to investigate the matter. The revenue of the Bu&amp;an District v-as given to the great grandfather of the present i^avam-ul-Mulk in token of his services to the Government. When the son of the present Qavam was married to Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, daughter of the late Eeza Shan Pahiavi, qavam-ul-Kulk took the opportunity of registering the whole district in his own name under the pretence of giving this as a dowiy to his daughter-in-law. The eclipse of the Heza Shah regime has led. to disputes between the agents of the Qavam and the •cultivators', the latter maintaining that the Qavam is only entitled to the revenue and that they and riot him are the legal owners of these lands. / Security 414. Wo robberies have been reported during the fortnight ' and the improvement in the general security of 'chis area has been maintained. Food Situation 41b. The issue of Government sugar and tea has been proceeding satisfactorily, although the sanctioned double rations of these ooumodities for the month of Bazasan have not yet been delivered to the people. It is reported that these are due to be issued next month. The issue of Government sugar and tea has produced a substantial fall in the market price of these articles which has now decreased to Dials 6,700 per bag and Dials 260 per kilo respectively. The price of cigarettes has further dropped to Dials 5.50 per packet of ten, while that of ghee from Dials 80 to Dials 70 per kilo. The date crop is over and large consignments of fresh dates are now coming on the market, thus further decreasing the price of last year's dates. There has been little change to report in the retail prices of other commodities - but the general situation continues to remain satisfactory. Financial 416.

It's surface is extremely uneven and it is Inadvisable to land any type of plane on It in its present condition, except in case of extreme emergency. 48. on the other hand *Balu* landing strip has had considerable work put In on It by Mr. Square/ of the Anti- Locust TTnlt. it was Inspected by His Msjestyls Consul on February 16th. The surface is excellent and both runways measure 8/lOths of a mile by speedometer reading. All markings are freshly painted and a windsock is available, / whichwhich can ha erected should notice he received or a proposed landing* only tm&gt; uneven patches were noted, and these will he pointed out to the Locust officer on his return. The landing strip, unfortunately, lies about seventeen miles off the main Kerman - Bandar Abbas road and is served by an extremely had road with two had river bed crossings to he negotiated. roou MiTumaM . 49.

The price and quality of bread remain as before. 60. incidence or malarial fever continues to be low. Diseases of the chest and throat are on the decrease owing to the warming up of the weather, one fresh oase of typhus at N&amp;khl - 1 - Nakhuda ana another at Khawja Atta occurred during this period but both nave recovered. The staff of this consulate have been Inoculated against typhus as well as the workers of the Knunji Mills, the jlsh Canning factory, the Hormuz Mines, the inmates of the local prison, the children of the boys and girls schools and the staff of all the Persian Government Departments, people in the town are also being inoculated. Ho oase of smallpox has been reported. 61. His KaJesty 9 B consul examined the question of the transport of petrol, oil and lubricant stocks to Lar from Bandar Abbas. The A.I.O.C. have stopped sending supplies owing to the appalling state of the road and its insecurity. The road to Lar crosses the boundaries of Pars in the neighbourhood of the Tang • i • Dalan and, until the Governors General of Pars and Kerman oan co-operate on (a) the mutual maintenance of the road and (b) th» evolution of a scheme whereby the gendarmerie of eaoh province oan aooompany trucks for the whole llngth of the road, there is little prospect of this route being much used by motor traffic. 52. The state of the road to Kexm&amp;n has also greatly deteriorated and it is difficult for passenger oars to travel along it. The responsibility for its upkeep la with the Kerman Beads Department and unless extensive repairs are carried out along it in the near future, it is feared that tnis vital life-line d&gt;f Bandar Abbas will become beyond all hope. 53. 30 trucks loaded with the following oargo left for the Interior during the fortnight under report : Tons Oargo Destination4 &gt;„ Tons Cargo Destination 48 petroleum products slrjan 46 - do - Kerman 92 • do • zahidan 19 - do - HafsinJ an 11 General Merchandise Yezd 5 Old iron Isfahan 221 Total. mxiA mznm- 54.

Both these gentleesn have been reported by the last two Consuls to b* ardent aerm&amp;nophiles. 67. iqai Firust howevert called later on paron 1st and endeavoured to appear friendly 9 though Aq&amp;t helaui still maintains hi* splendid isolation. 68. cm the 24th His Vsjesty f s Consul paid return calls on ths Heads of the aendaraerie t police, customs and Finance Departments. 69. ^is Majesty** consul visited the Fish canning Factory on the lath, production is in full swing and so eany tins havs been produced that some are available for local consumption. \s well as sardines, a new lino b&amp;Qu developed, the canning of -Tunny fish-. The actual fish osnned is not a tunny but oonsists of two or three varieties, ths chief of which is the chan*ad or Kingtish. This is, in fact, a large mackerel, which, in the Oulf, runs up to sixty pounds or more in weight, but whioh, once canned, provides quits a tolerable substitute for tunny. 70. neferenoe paragraph Ho. 6 3 above. urlng his visit to Horsus, His Majesty** Consul visited the salt mine on the west of ths island and the red oxide mine on the south. Both are not being worked at present, owing to lack of shipping to carry stocks already mined away. The installations are, however, being kept open for post war development. 71. The town of Koran * itself presents a sorry spectacle of min and would be quite deserted but for the wor* offered by the tflnes Department. Xhe population oaanot be more than^ about three hundred ana has dwindled owing to the lac* oi work and the severe typhus epidemic which broke out last year and HOMVZ / which/ vhloh 9 thanks to tha iaarrioianoy or tht rsrslan orrioials oonoerntlf was allowed to run Its oourss* \ ssriss or hlgb tides six weeks mao had washed a wax the sea rront and suoh Jetties as existed and had done some to the plies of 10 1 000 tons of red oxide waiting on the beaoh for soneone to take It away* The remains of a large whale whloh had been washed up with the tides were still in prorainenoe on the beaoh* 7a. The Portuguese fort at Hormus is probably the best prsserred of suoh relios to be seen in the oulf ana f though negleoted for sons three hundred years* shows few eigne of disintegration apart from the soars of war and tne depredations of the local inhabitants* who use the stones for building purposes. The reason for its state of preserrwtton appears to lie In the quality of the cement* with which the walls were built* and there is no doubt that it *a&amp; a looal product of Hon&amp;us. ir. Bulakh is T«ry interested in the fiture of this natural Horwus cement which is obtained from a white eountaln to the north - west of the oxide mine, tfot only is the cement impervious to sea water* but it appears to need little processing in comparison to that required by the normal limestone used in Indian production. If this Hormus cement is efficiently exploited after the war* it should prove a more valuable industry to tne island than even the red oxide. Mr. Bulaxh Informed Mis Majesty's consul that a British captain had been to Honan a to examine the cement and had later asked for two tons of it to be sent to Basrah. 73. reference paragraph 37 of 1946. The Governor General of Kerman is now reported to have recommended the appointment of iqai f?ami'i as Governor of Bandar \bbas. is this gentleman is unknown to the Cellahdari party, they have immediately assumed that he is a creature of the ftlsbah party and have accordingly wired to Sheikh Abdullah Gellahdari to take oounter measures in Tehran. 74. deference paragraph 537 of 1944. The usual quarterly oriels between the Vunloipallty ana the rfleotrlo Light company has arisen* as the imnioipality owes Hals 160*000 to the Company whloh it cannot pay. Tne &gt;*unloipality is chronically in debt and suoh meagre amounts as are sent from Tehran to this forgotten corner of Persia merely suffice to keep the runioipality's head above water for a few weeks. 75. It is too much to hope that sufficient funds will ever be forthcoming for attention to be paid to the roads of Bandar Abbas, in the town itself these were once quite good but now are in shocking condition* wnile outside the sotual town (l.e. the scattered portion whloh contains the British Consulate, the Lhunjl Mill* the fish canning Factory ana the Military Barracks) traffic has to find ths boat way it oan down sandy channels between the sand dunes. 76.

The expedition reached a point only fifty mllea west of the lake when It had to return owing to lack of petrol. dl. from Inquiries made by His Hajesty*s Consul It appears that the finance Department have no sohsme to distribute and ration bread locally. They are not interested in collecting the surpluses from the Hajlabad, Shamil and rinab areas and though ths crop this year promises to be universally good, they are not planning ahead in order to alleviate the shortage of bread In the ooastal parts of the aovernorate. 88. The local population have become accustomed to fish and dates, so long has It been Impossible to get bread easily and cheaply, 'ugar, cloth and tea are also unratloned and unobtainable by any but the monied olasaes. 88. reports from Jask show an even more distressing state of affairs with an ill-nourished population going about virtually naked. 84. The Head of the finance Department blanes the state of things on his euperlox* at Kerman, who apparently swooped on Bandar Abbas some five months ago and removed most of the tea, sugar and cloth at his disposal to Kerman. f 86* Meanwhile grain ana rice continue to oome in from the Truelal aoast and prices continue to fall, so that the position of ths middle classes in Bandar ibbas is not unsatisfactory*/ nmii 66 • The martret has been Tery dull throughout the fortnight under report. The prloe of good sugar hae fallen to Rials 6f000 per bag. The price of tea has fallen to Hlals i*no to &gt;!40 per kilo. The cloth market has been very slack: and wholesale prices are falling with, however, little effect on retail prices. The continued slump of ths market gives rise to rumours of the impending bankruptcy of many petty merchants and shopkeepers, 37, incidence of malaria continues to be low, Mo fresh oases of typhus or typhoid fever are reported from Nakhl - 1 - Nakhu&amp;a or elsewhere, one hundred and thirty two persons (Consulate, l.I.O.O, and Cray vaokensle a oo, employees) were given anti typhus vaccine injections by the Consulate sub - assistant Surgeon during the last month, respiratory diseases show a marked decrease due to the change of season, Mo case of smallpox is reported. 88.

Having obtained the ear of the Department of Justice, the Gendarmerie and the Cover nor ate in Kerman by the outlay of considerable sums of money, he succeeded in having an inspector from the Justice Department, Nazarian and one from the Gendarmerie, Mir Husseini, sent down to Bandar Abbas to investigate the affair. These inspectors started operations by accusing the ex-acting-Governor, Mosanenzadeh and Mohd Khan Gellahdari of implication in a case of robbery and arson committed by wandering Baluchis in Mushir»s village of Hassan Langi. IVarious officials suspected of partiality to the Gellahdari party were summarily impris- o*ed, though Mosanenzadeh managed to evade arrest by a few hours by leaving on the B.I. steamer for Khorrejnshehr. The new Governor Aqai Sepehrnia conveyed a message to His Majesty’s Consul in Kerman that the whole administration was in turmoil and requested him to speak to the Governor General. This official when interviewed by His Majesty*s Consul appeared unaware of the situation as he had only just arrived, but promised to make inquiries. As these can only be from Kerman officials already sweetened by Mushir Diwani, it is not expected that much will be done. The gravest aspect of the affair, is that Mushir, having been caught ought in his unofficial censorship of official mail (see para graph 384), has arranged for the inspectors to arrest the last post master, qaemi, and instal a creature of his own, Mubashiri. The cont ents of certain ' enclsir n telegrams from the Governor to Tehran have already been disclosed to Haji Mushir. ifUfj , The British Liaison Officer in Jask reports that while at dinner at the Postmaster’s house on October 10th with vexious other Persian officials, the local Chief of Police, Izlati, borrowed a paper and pencil from the Bakhshder and sat writing for some time. He then suddenly rose to his feet and, reading from the paper he had written, delivered a savage diatribe jgm against the British and their policy. He made a personal attack on Captain Ahmed as a despicable miufe character and a tool of British machinations against Persia. Finally he beacme violent and was only stopped from attacking the British Liaison officer with a revolver, by the assembled guests. Captain Ahmed reports that Izlati was not nmnwnto at all drunk. His Majesty’s Consul reported the affair to the Governor General in Kerman, who had the officer removed from his post next day. i/St • Three armed robbers raided and looted the house of a landlord at Sarkhoon on the night of tne 25th. The Gendarmes who went in pursuit succeeded in killing one of the robbers on the sppt and in arresting the other tv/o, who have been sent to Bandar Abbas for trial. Jaskjf/early - 8 - ^ 52 . .

Accustomed as they are to the depredations of senior officials down from Kerman 'on inspection', local gendarmerie commandants were dismayed by the rapacity of Colonel Goodarzi. In all he collecte d Ri als 100,000 from his various subord inates. A junior officer in 1KU Minab alone had to pay Rials 80,000 and to raise the sum has had to pledge his pay certificates with Mohd Khan Gellahdari. is a result of these depredations of Colonel Goodarzi it is expected that security in the outlying villages will deteriorate while the gendarmerie officers recoup their losses. nmvihk- uv.

The Gcvernor t h ? reu P on * itk ^°y r ^ S h °ve e beln the election committee stands as before. The Mushiris have been inundating Kerman and Tehran with petitions against the way t elections were being run, and it is now clear that they are out to cause all possible trouble by stirring up local animosities.

He has already sent instructions to start ^ behalf, and this is being done by Dr. Zar ^ e f ar » h ad nnntnr local hospital, wh6 is in some way connected with him.

It was reported that he was considering opening a reading room for the young 'Awazis of the town, but has dropped the idea on being told by the Governor thfct his act would have political motives attributed to it, 40. Numerous anonymous letters signed by the ’'Hizb-i-Marmooz'' or 'Mv*tic League' have been circulating.

Mohamed Ramazani of Nakhl-i-NaVhuda, a village about four miles from Bandar Abbas, was arrested by the Gendarmerie on the 23rd, charged with the murder of his two sisters. 65. Reference para 455 of 1945. The Electric Light Company has finally cut off all street lighting until such time as arrears amounting to Rials 342,117 are paid by the Municipality# A sum of Rials 40,000 sent by Tehran to the Municipality has been spent, half on paying off these dues and half on the arrears of pay of Municipal sweepers# Supply of current to private houses continues. 66. Sheikh Abdullah Gellahdari explained to H.M f s Consul that the Rials 2,500,000 donated by the Shah for the provision of a water supply for Bandar Abbas, were in fact to be recovered from the/of Finance and Agriculture, in the form of a write-off of debts owed to the Pahlevi family. As these Ministries are chronically bankrupt they have been unable to pay over the money, although a reluctant promise to pay up Rials 300,000 has been wrung from them. The hopes of a water supply have receded accordingly. 67 . in an effort to raise funds the Municipality has erected a toll-gate at Naiband which charges Rials 150 on all laden lorries passing. The A.I.O.C. who are the chief sufferers, have questioned the legality of this step in Tehran, and their local representative somewhat unwisely advised the chauffeurs under contract to the company hot to pay. This led to incidents at the toll-gate, and the threat of firing by the police in charge. On further orders from Tehran the A.I.O.C. have now instructed chauffeurs to pay under protest pending a clarification of the issue. H.M’s Consul has been pressing the Governor to spend the money already collected on clearing sand from the road, which is in a deplorable condition for a distance of two miles from the town to the Fish Factory. The Governor, however, appears unable to grasp the value of this ready-made answer to chauffeurs when they complain of this imposition, and talks cf spending the money on his sweepers. It iSy hoped that further pressure will be brought on him by Sheikh Abdullah Gellahdari and members of the Municipal Council, who have already hinted that the item 'sweepers' 1 would appear to cover the Governor's household expenditure. 68. Shortly after Sheikh Abdullah Gellahdari's arrival, and on the expiry of his Parliamentary immunity orders were received for his arrest, as the result of a complaint brought by a merchant in Tehran for the repayment of Rials 840,000 misappropriated by Sheikh Abdullah over a sugar deal. On Sheikh Abdullah’s new father-in-law Ahmed Gellahdari going guarantee for the sum, Bandar Abbas’ Member of Parliament has escaped the clutches of the law. It is, however, understood that there may be other cases pending against him, JASK 69. The last member of the R.A.F. left on March 1st. Houses on the aerodrome were^left in charge of the Gendarmerie pending final orders. The British Liaison Officer’s office has been closed and the Clerk in Charge withdrawn on the L.T^ 'Nearchus' on March 4th 70. Reference para 16 of 1946. Aghai Sepehrnia’s entirely praiseworthy suggestions to rationalise the administration at^ Jask has met with the answer from Tehran that, far from reducing the strength of departments at Jask, the Government desires to increase its stranglehold on that unfortunate village. With i - * /the3 the withdrawal of the R.A 0 F 0 and the resultant fall in the demand for labour, the economic conditions of Jask will become even more critical. This coupled with the increasing exactions of Mirza Barkat will in all probability lead to an exodus from the area of the poorer and less powerful elements of the population. Mirza has apparently not yet been confirmed in his post in the Gendarmerie but is being given a free hand to behave as he pleases. CHAHBAR 71. The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and H.M’s Consul interviewed the Indian community at Chahbar. Trade is still at a standstill. 72. There is at present no Bakhshdar in Chahbar, and the Garrison Commander, Setwan Obedi, is acting for the time being. He reported to H.M*s Consul that some strange^ from the north of Khorasan had recently arrived in Bahu Kalat in Dashtiari and* were spreading Tudeh propaganda among the Baluch in the area. / - i SECURITY 73. Reference para 19 of 1946. As a result of the amnesty offered to the petty bandits by Servan Salashoor, Ali Mohd Ali the Chief who has been lurking in the mountains near Lar finally ' agreed to come to Anguran to parley on March 24th. H.M’s Consul was invited by the Gendarmerie to attend, and Ali Jallal the Baluch Chief also accompanied the party. Ali Mohd Ali stated that he had lived quietly with his tribe in his village of Girdsiah, until the exactions of the landlords of Fin had led him to take reprisals. As a result of military operations his flocks had been driven off, his crops looted .and his entire tribe had to depend on banditry for a livelihood. He was only too anxious to live a quiet life, provided his property was restored, and the village of Girdsiah placed beyond the control of the landlords of Fin. As orders regarding an amnesty for him must come from Tehran, it is feared that the delay will lead to his once more taking to the hills, and the opportunity of assuring security in the area north of Bandar Abbad v/ill be lost. 74. Some camels belonging to the inhabitants of Rezwah and Sarzeh are said to have been stolen bv the followers of Sardah Dulkhani, the Turki Chief of the area on the borders of Fars.
