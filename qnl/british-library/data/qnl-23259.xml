Political Agency, Bahrain, the 11th September 1940. Prom The Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Shiraz. Sir, I have t he honour to attach copies of a telegram which was handed to me this morning by Mr. F.W. Ohliger, of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. 2. Mr. Ohliger informed me that on a previous occasion a telegram which his Company regarded as being of extreme importance, had taken nearly a week to reach San Francisco; and it was therefore his intention that the master of the T.V. M E1 Segundo” (Panamanian registry) should send the pre sent telegram as soon as she got to sea, l.e. in the course of that afternoon. 3. I asked Mr, Ohliger whether he had considered the possible consequences of infringing the monopoly of Cable and Wireless Limited, and also the international aspect of the situation. Mr. Ohliger replied that he knew that it had been agreed that masters of merchant ships in East Indian waters should not send messages other than those originating on board; and even instanced the Cairo Conference of 1933 on, apparently, this subject. He said, however, that he knew /-ft n. - 2 - knew of many instances in which its provisions had been broken# 4# I told Mr. Ohliger that as he had decided to take this step) whatever the consequences f he must understand that I could not give any kind of consent to his proposal, if that was his object in coming to see me. He replied that he had merely co*e 'as a matter of co-operation', in spite of the fact that the ship could easily have sent the message with nothing said to anyone. 5. After Mr. Obligees departure, I telephoned Commander Way, “khe Secretary to the Senior Navil Officer; and conveyed to him the gist of this letter, as the Senior Naval Officer was not then ashcre. 6.

Mr. Ohliger mentioned that there was wireless equipment at Dhahran which he believed was capable oi transmitting to America direct and enquired wnether I had any objection to its being used and ir not what censorship arrangements would be required. He must have Known tnat I could not answer such a question and I do not Know why he asked it. Hov/ever I gave the obvious reply that this was a matter outside my jurisdiction and only tor the Saudi Arabian uovt. The Concession Agreement must contain a clause regard ing the use of wireless equipment. This conversation only referred to sending a single message about the air raid but now it appears that the equipment is being regularly used to avoid censorship in Bahrain.

Will you please refer to Prior*s demi-official letter No.C/438 of the 8th September 1941, of which he has sent a copy to you direct ? As the correspondence which he has sent to you discloses, we take objection to the practice adopted by the California Arabian Standard Oil Co. in Hasa of using a short wave wireless transmitter fitted in one of their launches to communicate direct with the united States of America, it is quite true that a ship on the high seas which is duly authorised to carry wireless by the country of registry is entitled to work with any wireless station it pleases, but the practice of handing over telegrams from land, where there is an international system of communication, to a ship or launch to be transmitted after it has gone beyond territorial waters, as we see it is irregular and contrary to the intention of the International Regulations. We are not concerned to preserve Cable and wireless rights in Saudi Arabia, but we are concerned to ensure that no information should be transmitted by wireless en clair or in an ordinary commercial code which might be of value to the enemy. Probably 95$ of the messages sent by the Oil Co. refer solely to internal administrative details which are of no value whatsoever to anyone except themselves, but the odd 5$ may convey information, possibly about the movement* of tankers, which it is most important tnat the enemy should not learn. 2. fhe refusal of the local officials of the Oil Co. to comply with the wishes expressed by the Political Agent, Bahrain, on our behalf denotes a somewhat unexpected deteriora tion in their standards of cooperation. Ashley, whom we asked to intervene, is a California Standard roan and was extremely surprised to hear of the attitude adopted by Dhahran. He himself offered to communicate with the head office in the U.S.A. and stated the belief that if he did so there would be little doubt that instructions would be issued to Dhahran to comply with our wishes. As however his expectation has not been fulfilled, we would now suggest that the matter be raised with the Company's representative in London. We do not wish to be heavy-handed over this matter, though presumably it would be possible to ask Ibn Saud to prohibit the use of wireless installations in launches based on any port in Hasa in view of Cable and Wireless’s rights in Arabia and the Oil Company’s obvious intention of defeating those rights. Perhaps if you would be willing to discuss with Ballantyne the matter could be settled amicably enough. 3. A copy of this letter is being sent to Prior.

Reference 49547/41* I ONYX IE YTIAL Dear Eyres, yith reference t o your letter of the 15th December about the transmission o^ messages r iirect to the United States by means of a wireless transmitter on one the launches o^ the California Arabian Standard Oil Company at T 'asa, I should explain that the ciuestion of the use o 1 * the radiotelegraph service for the transmission of what are ^ roperIv spea -' Q point-to-point telegrams was considered by the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee in 1336 when rates ^or radiotelegrams exchanged with this country were reduced. It was reco^gised that where the telegrap.h rates t.ere nigh senders could effect some saving by handing tneir messages to ships* personnel for transmission after the ship had s iled # The Postmaster General had previously written to the principal companies operating wireless installations in ~hips registered in the United Kingdom pointing out that the practice was irregular and reg nesting them to issue suitable instructions to operators on ships under their control so as to prevent any organised service of the kind. At that time the Madrid Telegraph Regulations (1932) were in force and while the practice was clearly contrary to the spirit of the reforwarding provisions contained in Article 51 of those Regulations, there was nothing' in the Regulations which enabled a really effective control to be exercised. At the Cairo Radiocommunication Conference of 1338 the matter was raised by other Administrations and the views of the Conference are expressed in the t voue' f reproduced at page ^17 of -he International Radiocommunication Regulations 1938. This voue /recommends TRjuUC OMMUKI CAT I Ono , * rvca rp nv i't rur GjJ XM jJiXVIJj X Oo X X X , LONDON, 3.0. 1. 20th Deceirfber 1241.reooimnends, inter alia, tli^t idiinistr? tions do all tliey can to i-xrevent the handing in on hoard ships in port of radiotelegrams intended to he transmitted after the departure of the ship. It apples t^ radioteleprams from all mobile stations; not only to messages handed to a tanker for despatch as soon as the ship has put to sea hut also to messages ferried from the shore to launches or to other vessels, I do not think that there are any leral grounds upon which the 3audi Arabian Orovernment could stop the practice and as explained below the only- thing to do is to stop the mobile st°tio ? from sending the messages. I re x . o ' .o • otbreak of 'jar the Jtr t utory Begula^tions 01 this country, ' inch had been drawn up a^*ter the Badrid Conference, * were in process of revision to give effect to the decisions of tie Cairo Conference aod it was intended to consider'how far effect could he given to the Cairo recommendation on this subject hut the revision, has been suspended. As you know the Admiralty impose very strict war-time control on thu use of the radiotelegraph installations of British ships and it seems to me that the particular abuse to which you draw/ attention could he effectively controlled by instructions issued by the United States authorities to ships on their register. There are important security considerations which the United States Authorities no doubt have in mind, I am sending a copy of this letter to Lycett who, I under stand, proposes to s x .eak to Captain lent worth of the United States Navy on the subject. I should perhaps point out that I use the term ‘^radio- telegram' in the special sense in which it is defined in the Annex to the International Telecommunication Convention. I use the term 'mobile station' in the sense it is defined in Art. 183 of the General hadiocommunication Begulations. I return the document which you enclosed. Yours sincerely, 3d, L.V.
