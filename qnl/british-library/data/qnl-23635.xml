The /^inarch, 1944 • To The Secretary to the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• Memorandum I enclose the duplicate copy of Bushire Way Bill No.80. It *ill be seen from this that at present mails for this Agency and registered and unregistered letters for on ward despatch are all included in one bag and are entered in one way bill. All articles in Bushire way bills are checked and signed for by the Assistant Political Agent, Letters for onward posting are then handed over to a clerk who has to compile a separate statement of all the letters both registered and unregistered for onward transmission, enter the postage paid on each item and forward a copy of the statement with charges to you as a vouchor for the Bushire Account. All this entails an enormous amount of unnecessary work, and I would request that in future the following system bo adopted (a) Letters actually for this Agency to be put in a separate bag and undjr a separate way bill* (b) Registered letters for onward transmission to be in a separate bag under a separate way bill* A column should be loft bJiink down one side of/way bill in which registered charges can be filled in. The copy of this way bill/be returned as a voucher on the Bushire Account. (c) Unregistered letters for onward transmission to be stamped in Bushire by the senders. A stock of Bahrain stamps can bo sent to you for this purpose. Such letters should be sent in a separate packet under a separate way bill. (d) All items on way bills to be numbered and the relevant cover to be marked with$Ji its own number. (e) Way bills to bo typed. This system which is practised by most offices, would save us a great deal of unnecessary labour and should not be an undue burden to you, as it merely entails the keeping of the various types of mail in separate boxes, and the stamping of unregistered letters. c— for Political Agent, Bahrain._ HO. l&amp;bl B/VimAIN.

BRITISH RESIDENCY AND CONSULATE GENERAL, BUSHIRE. Dated 10th August, 1944. The Political Agent, BAHRAIN. Memorandum . Reference your memorandum No. 2197-14/12, dated the 1st. August, 1944. 2. Since the receipt of your memorandum No. 796, dated the 20th. March, 1944, the procedure which you requested should he followed has heen adhered to as closely as possible on all occasions. There is invariably and unavoidably, however, a certain number of last-minute letters received by the Despatch Clerk after he has closed the main mail-bags. These letters are placed in a separate bag. In the short time avail able at that period, there is not the opportunity to do more than to enter them on way-bills by hand with the least possible delay. It is realised that the contents of the 'last-minute bag ,, may be the cause of some inconvenience to you, but it is hoped that in the circumstances explained you will make due allowances for departure from the standard procedure. All branches of this office have been instructed to minimize the number of letters handed in after the closing of the main bags. 3. Suitable instructions have been issued on the subject of para 3 of your memorandum under reference. for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.7 ' ' DEPT. BRANCH. Section. Heading.
