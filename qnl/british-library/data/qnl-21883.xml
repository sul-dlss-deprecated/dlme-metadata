If any threat to Bahrain develops in the fiieaiitirae the crews of the Heavy A.A. guns would be brought oack from Abadan; but the military authorities take the view that at present Abadan i« more vulnerable to air attack than Bahrain, and ere disposing their available forces accordingly. 3. The detachment of the 3/11 Sikhs now stationed at Baiirain is being transferred to Iraq, and will be relieved by a detachment from a Garrison Battalion. Bahrain, as the war recedes from this part of the world, is necessarily receiving lower priority in the order of military coiui dtments, and front line troops are being transferred to areas where they will have better opportunity of proving their mettle.
