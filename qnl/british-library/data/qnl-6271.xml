AR-IS-TRAI'E ...The G. of I. on the 1st of Pebrnar„ /?o7 addressed a despatch to H. J. G-. on the subject of the ams trade at llashat 8c inthe P. Cf. The G-. of I. had in the ^ ear 190o submitted reconnend- ations to his LI. G.with a viev; to check &amp; connrol the traffic in arms. The proposals then made were agree to the prohibition b„ the Sultan of IJaskat of arms 8c amnnrinto his dominions. al in the case of Persia , Koweit , Fahrein , 8 c the Tmcial coast , it would be desirable , in order to make the circle complete , that some understanding sh should be arrived at regdg: Turkish territory also . It was urged that , if possible , an arrangement might be made with Turke w either for the search of ves. sels filing the Turkish flag b w 7 ritish ships of war o'tffor the issue of a formal notifn: b w Turke w prohibi ting the import at iion of arms into the Ottoman domin ions . In repl w the G. of I.had been informed on the 3rd Nov: 190othat the question of the suppression of the traffic had been informally broached b w Lord Lansdowne to the French ambassador ,8c that the 7 r: am bassador had been instructed to obtain from the PDrte a formal notification t o the effect that the ihpdrtation of arms into Turkishdominions was pro hib* ited . T n addressing Lord Lansdovmie on the subject in his despatch , dated 16th Nov: , Sir N. O’connor pointed out , however, that it would be inexpedient , in the circs: explaind b w him , to invite a formal notificn: from the Porte ,which might be given in a form to which H. LI. Of. would be obliged to demur , in view of the fact that negotiations for a commercial treaty between Cf. Tn 8c Turkey were still in suspense ♦ (l)that the French Govt: should be asked to (2)that as the importation of arms was illeg-reg- Sir N. O’Connor referred to the fact that certain illations , notified the Porte in 139C , after acceptance in the Turco-G-eman Connercial Treaty, although not accepted b w the other Powers , enbodied the laws of Turke^ in force against all nationalities other thanthose with v;hose Treaties &amp; Capitulations the„ night- clash • His Ex •, therefore , suggested that the notificnsr already nade b w the Borte night perhaps serve the purpose of the Of. of I. Having regard to this suggestion , the G-. of I. , in their S. Ex: despatch No: 6 , dated 31st Llarch 1904 proposed that , as the proclanation b^ the Sultan of ^astat, dated the loth ^an: 1393 y related onl^ to ams 5? an in: which were intent, ended for ^ndian. &amp; Persian ports , H which were also the properr^ of ■ r ^itish, Persian or xlas^'.at subjects y the #tms of the proclanation should be revised so as to nake it applicable to ams &amp;annn: intended for Turkish ports, &amp; the property of an w persons whatsoever . T t was further proposed that the opportunit should proclan be taken to anend the application eheuld-be-revicea- so as to nake it applicable also to the case of ams consigned to the territories of/ the Sheikh of Fahrein , the Sheikh of Koweit or of the Tracial chiefs . rinail w , it was suggested that , as the Turkish irovemnent i/^ere vitally interested in checking the krade in ams in Northern Arabia , the w night perhaps •' r billing to agree to our searching ail vessels in Koweit waters without prejudice to the question of the authority under which the right would be exercised , or to our exercising such a right of search in Turkish territorial waters in the P. Of. outside the Shatt- el- Arab without referring specially to Koweit .In Ur, Frodric 1 !^ ‘telegran. , dated 24th June 1904rth 4 - the Of. of I. was infomed , however ,that it had been decided to defer for the present fresh measures for the restricting the importation of arms at Koweit This decision was arrived at because it was consid ered at the time that , if the importation of arms at Koweit were prevented , it would assist the Turhs in determining the supremacy in Nejd of their nominee Fin Rashid against Fin Sand , the friend, of the Sheikh of Koweit . Since June 1904 no further direct conmunition was received from the Sec: of State on the subject of the above proposals for the suppression of the arms traffic , &amp; while recog nizing to the f-ull the serious nature of the diploma atic difficult!eswhich had hitherto tied the hands of H. LI. Of. in the matter , the G-. of I.now ask w T hether having regard to the considerations brought to notice below , it would be possible for afor- ward move to be made inthe direction previously indicated by then. The profound importance of the whole question was nee more apparent now than it had ever been before . In para: 3 .of their S. bix: despatch No: 112, da ted 30th July 1903, the Government of India had referred to astatement showing the t&amp;r totalof arms mammn: consigned to the. P. G-. as indicated in returns received from the India office . It was noted that the figures showed a growing traffic up to 1900, when the number of rifled weapons imported into Llaskat reached the total of 13,331, but that sine that year there was evidence of a satisfactory decline .A statement had alsobeen-fttraished-y-pya-Yid ed-b- forwarded prepared fromfigures furnished by the Customs author!ti^.g ofthe Sultan of Llaskat from which the inference could be drawn that though the dimensions sf the trade were still formidable, it had undoubtedly rec^eved a check since the ear p 1900 .The. now forwarded two similar statementscovering the period which had elapsed since our despatch of 19o3 .The v regretted to note that but one conclusion could be drawn, fron these statements , namely , that there had been an alarming increase in the arms trade at llaskat . In spite of the fact that the local Oman market had long since^ been glutted , there wa/s reason to believe that in the w ear 1904-05 the total number of rifles imported at Jaskat had not been less than 20, 000, while the aggregate value of the rifles &amp; annn: landed there from Europe had amounted to no less than dollars 1,210,349. It was also significant that whereas in ^ 1899-1900 about ' r /7th of the imports were from Prance , b w 1905 the proportion of French arms had risen to 4/10ths .A third statement enclosed showed the number of rejjorts which had reached the Of. of I. during the past w ear of the landing of arms at I.Iaskat , &amp; at othr ports after transhipment from // I.Iaskat . ' r t was worth noting in this connection that according toreportd received from the Poll: Agent at -laskat , the Sultan had re-centl w borrowed large sums of none^ from Gogu^er , w^hich v/ould be repaid b^ deduction from the dut w due b w the firm on the lai^ge consignments of arms imported b w then, w r hile another Frdnch merchant , J. Caracaila , encouraged b w the success of his predeces'or , v/as about to open a business in arms ft arann: at Fa skat . The G-. of I. had mentioned also in para: 5. of the above mentioned despatch that the ultimate d estim ation of the armslanded at llaskat vms in a large measure conjectural . The w stated that the existence of an w consider-able traffic w T ith the African sea board had not been established , ft that it seemed probable that the consignments eventually found their wa^ into the interior of Oman , to the Arab ft Turkish coasts of the Cfnlf ftto the Persian seaboard , a proportion' reaching the tribes on the TT.Vf.F.of India, with results that constituted a grave menace to thepeace of the border . The information v/hich had been received from time to time during the last three „ ears had confirmed the opinion that no traffic in arms worth considering was carried on between llashat &amp; the African seaboard. Moreover , on 17th Octets* 1903 , the Sultan of Uashat in deference to the wishes of the Iritish &amp; Italian Governments had issued a notification pro hibiting the export of arms &amp; annn: from his territo^ ries to the African coast &amp; islands(including Socotra; under Fritish protect lon&amp;situated to the north of Cane Guardafui as also to the Italian possessions on the east coast of Africa . On the other hand , there could be no doubt that b^ far the greater part of the arms landed at Llashat left again b w sea , &amp; that I.Iashat had now earned the reputation of being the arms depot of the entire Iliddle hast . In the opinion of the Of.of I. it was hardly possible to exaggerate the injurious effects of this trade which had already undermined , to a great extent , the authority of the Persian &amp; Turhish Governments in their own territories . Fut , from the point of view of the G.of I. b o far the most important aspect of the arms trade was its bearing upon the question of the supply of weapons to the tribes on the &gt;T.Y r .F. of India &amp; to Afghanistan. 4s stated in para: 2 of the above-mentioned despatch an arrangement was made with the Persian Gov: Gen of Kerman for the adopti m of special measures to pre vent the importation of arms into Persian Faluchistan &amp;to impose restrictions on their possesion in that $/ province .In spite of th/is arrangement there was evi dence that arms had been continued to be introd uced with increasing frequency at the small ports as ^et uncontrolled b w the Persian Imperial Customs &amp; in 1904 about 1500 II. H. rifles from Mas hat ‘ we re believed to have been landed at Galag alone , whila, in Tan: &amp; Feb: 1905,about 1500 rifles with ten casescartridges were brought ashore at the sane place . In 1901 , in the course of the I.Iahsud blockade , over- whelning evidence was received of the arrival of large consignnents of P.G-.ams &amp; amnn: in l/aziristan fc there was no doubt that Afghan &amp; Faluchi dealers procured large quantities of ams f ron Llaskat , which v^ere mostly snuggled in sailing craft to lonely places on the coast near Funder Abbas &amp; Llinab , whence the^ were picked up b w the purchasers Fx? carried inland concealed in canel litters F? in the franework of canel saddles . iron infomation in their possession the Of.of I. were led to believe that out of 270,000 nen belonging to the frontier tribes no fewer than 94,000 possessed breech-loading rifled ams fT. r ith regard to Afghanistan the Of.of I. recently received the disquieting intelligence that a number of rifles had reached the Herat &amp; Kandahar districts &amp; that the w were being freely sold among the tribesmen with the approval of the local Afghan officials . / Ihe trade in these ams was no longer prohibited ] 3 w the Amir in accordance with the poiic w pursued b w his father , &amp; his llajest w was reported to have stated openl w that he had no objection to the acquisition p of weapons of precision b w his subjects . That fact alone , in the opinion of the G.ofl. rendered it essen entia^ to redouble the efforts to stop the traffic. 1 i 'h statement forvvarded with the present desp atch showed the number of cases of 'smuggling of rifes &amp; a - rin: bo the H.b.F. F? Afghanistan that had come to notice during the past ^ear . The local Poll: Officers had made various sugg estions for interesting the Persian authorities in the stoppage of the traffic , &amp; for rendering tjiem such assistance as the w might need in the matter.These suggestions were being considered &amp; in due course such orders would bepassed on then as night a£ seen advisable .Apart , however , fron the fact that there were political obstacles in the wa w of adoptingsone of the neasures propose^!, the G.of I. regarded it as certain thateffective action for the suppression of the ams trade could not be taken b^ the Persian authorities . On thecoast the Felgian Custon Officials were few in mmber , &amp; although perhaps willing to give assistance f or the suppress- ion oi the traffic , the w had not the naans at their disposal really to take efficient naasures to deal w ith the evil . Inland , as was well 1 moTOi, the Persian authorities were powerless outside the towns , fc large caravans could travel b^ unfrequented r )utes vrithout the slightest risk of interference, ft would be difficult to secure the consent of theTf*^ our co-operation with then in capturing the snugglers where alone such captures could be effectively carried 01 9 on the iioh-i-.Ialik- Siah Seistan frontier. Action there too night cause unrest anongst the Afghns though fo vemnent hadreason to believe that the tradrs were nen who lived perhaps as nuch in Fritish as in Afghan territory . Still , if the consent of the Persian Okrvt: could be obtained this Govt: would be prepared to try to stop this great &amp; growing evil b sone such action . ft remained to consider the possibility of' taring action * either at the source of the trade .'as'*- kat , or on the high seas . Vith regard to the latter alternative the Govt: of 1.forwardedwith the des—patch copies of two letters, dated 26th April &amp; 6th Oct: 1006 , fron the TTaval CinC. j. hf w agreed with hin that, while the presence of a nan-of-war at lias kat &amp; in its vicinity acted as a deterrent on the export of ams to the Persian coast y et this measure even combined with the patrol of the Jakran coast by agun-boat could never be really efficacious . They hoped that good effects night beproduced on the traffic when the steari-launches which the Of. of I. were now building for the Persian Govt werein connision, but the„ doubted whether these boats would be really enplo^ed to keep a sufficiently constant w T atch on the coast to prevent snuggling . The G. of I. we re therefore , forced to the conclusdm that the ams trade would continue to flourish &amp; in crease until the Agreenent with the French which the„ had advocated wets arrived at , &amp; a conplete prohi bition was enforced against the importation of arms &amp; arum: into the territories of the Sultan of Jaskat. The w realised that H.I.I.G.had considered it advisable to defer making an, request to the French Govt: pending the settlement of the negotiationdarising out of the arbitrationHague award . As , hov;ever, consid** erableconcessions had been made &amp; it now seems probable that the negotiations would result in an arrangement which would be satisfactory to the French Govt: , they entertained a hope that H.LI.G. would regard the present moment as propitious for action in the matter of the ams trade.If so the /G.of I. would venture to suggest that in approaching the French Govt: the nature of the evils &amp; therr far- reaching consequences , arising from thetraffic might be explained , as the v are probably not fully known except to thecountries which suffer . It might be pointed out that Fritish trade would stand to lose y{ more than even French by the introduction of the ref orm proposed , as the more than half the traffic was still in English hands. Text , with regard to the proposed negotiations w r ith the Turkish Govt:, which , however , the G.of I. regarded as of secondary importance , &amp; which should certainly not be allowed to delay action on what they regarded as the vital question of stopping the trade at Easkat , they would draw attention to the fact that/neasures concerted with the Tur 1 :s'FvFthF~^ &gt; TV Dprevention of the ame trade at Koweit^^fthe prog|&lt; ^ ress of events since 1004 had rendered it no lohger rival , S: for the present held so strong a position h necessar^ to pa w serious consideration to the argunent thatjy^^vj-ould imfairl w handicap Fin Saood , the friend of the Sheihh of Koweit , in his struggle for suprens w in ^Tejd against Fin Rashid , the noninee of the Turhs .Fin Saud had just succeeded in r .:illing his ^ f( in ITejd against asto he practically independent of such indirectaid as the Fritish could afford hin by conniving at the continuance of the ams trade with the interior , Ft was , therefore , not only justifiable but even incunbent upon us to adopt any practicable neasur^s for the suppression of the ams trade at Koweit so far as this could be done without seriously alienating the Sheihh . The Of. of therefore , reconnended that having reg# ard to the opinion of H.K.'s ambassador at Constantin nopie on the subject of the Turkish notification prohibiting the inportof ams , &amp; to the special agreements which had been made with the Sheikhs of y. Fahrein 8: Koweit &amp; with the Trucial chiefs, the 89 Jaskat Proclamation of 1^8 should be revised in such nn a matter as to cover the export of ams from Kaskat Z not noiy to Indian fr Persian ports , bu alss to an.y port, v/hatever in the Persian Chi If , including those f of the Ottoman bmp ire . Ff their suggestion were approved , H.J.Oovt: would doubtless consider the advisability of infomign the Turkish Ofovt:of the pro posal that the Sultan of liaskat should issue a • - ohibi- proc^lamation extending to Turkish ports the prehiaia- tion to export ams . The Govts: of the Yfestem countries concerned in the trade of Llaskat would doubtless raise no objection as they had not protested against the measures taken by the Sultan to prev ent the export of ams &amp; annn: to Persian &amp; Indian ports ft to the African coast ft islands . Ff ,however there were ar.y doubt in regard to the point , the Govts: of Prance ft of the United States might be askedto abrogate their rights as regards the export as well as regards the inport of ams . The GK of I. , had previously suggested that in order to enlarge their powers as regards the seizure of ams , the words ’’and if the^ ( the ams) are the property of Iritish , Persian or LI a skat subjects' should be onitted fron the Llaskat proclanation . It was possible , however , that this proposal night be regarded as open to objection , as even powers which have no treaty rights in the natter nightbe unwilling to acquiesce in the application to the property of their subjects of the power of confiscation granted to T ritish &amp; Persian ships of war by the Llaskat proclanation. powers which, like France ,possessed % treaty rights with Jaskat night be expected to exer cise their right of protest unless they deliberately waived it. In# these circunstances , they would nerely reconnend that should the view be upheld that the Prpclanation of 1393 night be expended to the export of ams to the Ottonan Iiinplre , the Island of lahrein Koweit &amp; the ports of the Trucial chiefs, the words '&amp; if they are the property of Fritish , Persian , &amp; I.Iaskat subjects ' night be anplified by the inclusion of subjects of these other countries . Subjects of France , &amp;of the United States , &amp; of Holland night also be included in the event of these nations agreeing to act in concert with us in thr natter &gt; . Should it be found necessary to enter upon negotiation in regard to the natter with the Turkish O-ovt: , which night involve delay , the Indian Cfovt: would re- connended that the Prpclanation night , at all events, be revised at once , as reconnended , with reference to Jahrein , Koweit &amp; the ports of the Trucial chiefs.. Inthis connection ,1c with special reference to the question of the inport of ams at Koweit , they would connend , for the further consideration of H.J.Oovt:to consent ti theei.ercise Fritishshios of ar whether in Koweit waters or in Turkish territorial Gulf waters in the Persian outside the Shat-ul-Arab of the right to search vessels including those fl w ing the Turkish flag , v;hich he suspected of canning ams . It appeared not inprobable that the Porte would be inclined to consider favourably an w proposals that H.A.Govt: night dr-cide ts put forward with whe ob- ject of suppressing the ams traffic , since tir n. O’Conor telegraphed to the Vicero w on loth ...arch 1^06 that the Ottonan authorities were reporting constant ly to the Porte that Fritish officers were favouring the inport of arns into Arabia &amp; he anticipated that the Turkish Govt: night femulate an. official con- plaint in the natter . Pinal 1^ , in the etfent , v;hich they tmsted was uni likely , of its being found inpossible to concert neasures with prance for complete abolition oi the ams trade in the near future , the G. of i. ventured again to repeat the recommendation nade in their Secret-lixtemal despatch , TTo: lof , dated the 18th Aug: 1904 , to the effect that in order to secure the ams trade renaining as far as possible , while it existed , in the hands of I ritish subjects , the Poll:Resident in the P G. might be authorised to cancel the rules issued in 13 under which T ritish subjects at llaskat were required to submit weekly a statements to the Poll: Agent of the importation fr h sale b w then of &amp; annn: .The Deputy Jeoretary to the aovemment of India in the Foreign Department* .

On the 14th November, the Gov- bahrein. ernment of India ad- Judiciai powers to be dressed the Secretary of caf Agent by the Politl ' State on the subject of the judicial powers exercised by the British Agent in Bahrein. They stated that the Agent had the powers of a Magistrate of the 1st class as described in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, in respect of offences committed by Native Indian subjects of His Majesty in the island of Bahrein and on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, and that he extended his good offices to European foreigners in any disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects. He also was in the habit of holding a court, composed of himself and a representative of the Chief, for the trial of cases in which the accused was a Bahrein subject or a foreigner who preferred not to invoke British good offices, and the other party was a British or foreign subject who did so. Pinally, he controlled a local court of arbitration for the adjustment of civil disputes between British subjects and proteges on the one hand, and Bahrein subjects or persons of any other nationality on the other hand. This court had been in existence for over 50 years. He also, on occasions, issued bills of health, signed marine protests, and legalised signatures on behalf of British Indian subjects. Strictly speaking, however, he had no legal authority for undertaking these latter duties. With a view to define and regularise the powers exercised over British subjects by the Agent, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had put forward the suggestion that he should be appointed to be a Justice of the Peace and endowed with the powers of a District Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay. The Government of India concurred in this recommendation, but with reference to clause 2 of the Indian Poreign Jurisdiction Order in Council, 1902, they understood that it would first be necessary for Bahrein to be declared by His Majesty in Council to be a territory in which jurisdiction was exercised by, or on behalf of, His Majesty through the Governor-General in Council. They accordingly requested that, if His Majesty’s Government saw no objection, the necessary Order in Council might be passed providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in Bahrein. But, further, in view of the increase of foreign shipping and foreign interest2 generally in the Gulf, and of the establish- m of foreign firms and missions in Bahrein, it seemed desirable that, if possible, provision Sdould be m§de in the Order in Council for the exercise by the Political Agent of juris diction over foreigners in Bahrein, before foreign interests had so largely developed as to render the assumption of the legal duties of a protecting Power a matter of greater intricacy acd difficulty. Bahrein had been under sole British domination since 3820, and on several occasions the Government of India had had to interfere by armed force, either to prevent the Chief of Bahrein from attacking his neighbours, or them from attacking him, or to settle matters relating to the Chiefship. In 1880, by a treaty published for public information, the Sheikh had bound himself to abstain from making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British and to refuse to permit other Powers to establish diplomatic or Consular Agencies or coaling depdts without the consent of the British Government. This treaty in itself constituted a sort of protectorate, which might perhaps be regarded as having ripened into maturity in consequence of the open and regular exercise of protectorate powers by Great Britain. It was understood that Prance, Germany, and America had all received in formal notice of the existence of a British Protectorate over Bahrein and that this had recently been announced formally to the Pow ers most directly concerned, Turkey and Persia. If His Majesty^ Government con sidered it feasible in the circumstances to assume jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, it was recommended that this should be done, and also, that the Order in Council should, if possible, be so framed as to enable the Political Agent to perform the functions of a Notary Public. 206. On the 1st October 1906, an indi- Aiieged abduction of ^idual named Abdur a Turkish girl from Rahim bin Othman Baghdad to Bahrein. appeared before the Political Agent, Bahrein, and alleged that he had been commissioned by Taufig Effendi, a clerk in the Customs Department, Basra, to search at Bahrein for the latter’s daughter who had been abducted from Baghdad by certain Ottoman subjects. Abdur Rahim stated that he had found the girl in the house of Ali bin Amar, a resident of Koweit and Bahrein, who claimed to have purchased her at Koweit. He requested that the girl might be sent to Basra and that Ali bin Amar might also be forwarded there for trial on the charge of having stolen the girl and allowed her to be cohabited with illegally. The Political Agent summoned Ali bin Amar toappear before him and the girl was also produced. The latter admitted that she was of Turkish origin and had come from Baghdad, hut as she refused to state her father’s name, and as Ahdur Rahim had never seen her before, there was no evidence of her identity with the girl said to have been abducted from Baghdad. Ali bin Amar stated that he would produce documents signed by the Kazi of Koweit to prove that the girl had been married to his son. The Political Agent, there upon, placed the girl in charge of a respectable Arab merchant, and instructed Abdur Rahim that if he wished to prove his story, he should * summon the father of the missing girl to Bahrein to produce evidence of her identity with the girl produced. On the 4th October 1906, the Yali of Basra made a representation on the same sub ject to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at that place. The Vali requested that the girl might be handed over to Abdur Rahim and that the culprits might be handed over under guard to the same person for transmission to Basra for punishment. The Consul after consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf replied that the identity of the girl had not been established and that in order to prove it either the complainant or an agent properly authorised by him should proceed to Bahrein. Mr. Crow added that the Ottoman subjects who had taken the girl from Baghdad did not appear to be at Bahrein and that Ali bin Amar, who, according to his statement, had purchased the girl at Koweit, was not a Turkish subject but a subject of the Sheikh of Bahrein, In a letter addressed to the Chief of Bahrein on the same subject the Vali of Basra made the same request as he had made to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basra. Under advice from the Political Agent Sheikh Esa refrained from replying to the Yali unless and until he should receive instructions from the Government of India to do so. He wrote also to Abdur Rahim reiterating the reply which had already been given to the latter by the Political Agent and referring him for further information to the British Govern ment. On the 7th February 1907, the Gov ernment of India addressed the Secretary of State for India on the subject and stated that they proposed, if the Secretary of State agreed, to approve the action taken by the local Political Officers in the matter. They regarded it as satisfactory that the Turks, with a view to securing redress, had had to recognise and appeal to British authority in Bahrein and they considered that this incident had done much to support the British Protectorate over4 Bahrein. They proposed to leave it to the Turkish authorities to make the next move in the matter, and stated that it seemed desir able to restore the girl to her father and even to try formally the man ‘ Ali bin Amar ’ if the Turkish authorities sent the girl’s father to Bahrein and agreed to recognise the jurisdic tion of the joint Court held there under British auspices. In a despatch of the 26th April to the Government of India the Secretary of State for India concurred generally in the proposals of the Government of India. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was accordingly informed. On the 17th November 1907, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the case had been tried by the local Kazi and that the result of the trial had been satisfactory. At the commencement of the trial the defendant ‘Ali produced a letter from the Kazi of Koweit certifying that the girl had been married in his presence to his servant Bashir, but the Kazi of Manama had elicited the information that Bashir was a slave at the time and for this and various technical reasons ruled that the marriage was null and void and declared that after the expiry of the period of “iddat” the girl would be at liberty to marry where she liked. The Political Agent reported that the Turkish subject Abdur Rahim bin Othman was absent from Bahrein and that no other Turkish subject had evinced any interest in the case. 207. {Vide paragraph 182, September Quarantine arrange- 1207.) On the 7ti ments in the Persian November 1907, th&lt; Qulf ' Secretary of State for India telegraphed his approval to the proposals made by the Government of India in their telegram of the 21st September and stated that His Majesty’s Government consented to bear half the cost. The Government of India were requested to take necessary measures to carry out the proposals. The decision of the Secretary of State was accordingly communicated to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 208. {Vide paragraph 181, September kottveit, 1907.) On the ■ 21st Piracies committed on November 1907, the a dnow - Secretary of State for India telegraphed that the Tehran Legation had been informed by telegraph that though the sufferers in one of the piracy cases were Persian subjects yet the British Government had a vital interest in the suppression of piracy in Gulf waters, and that, as regards the case in which the crew and passengers of a Koweit boom were murdered, the British Government were bound to extend their good offices to Koweitis. His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran wasinstructed to make strong representations to the Persian Government with a view to the capture and punishment of the offenders and to the recovery of full pecuniary repar ation for the Koweitis who had suffered. The Persian Government was also to he informed that if the demands were not com plied with, suitable naval action would be taken for the capture and delivery of the offenders to Persian authorities. At the request of the Foreign Office the Admiralty instructed the “ Highflyer ” to proceed at once to Dayir with a view to capture the pirates at sea, but the Captain of the vessel was given authority to land a sufficient force temporarily at Dayir or elsewhere on the Persian littoral, if necessary, in order to effect the desired result. 209. (Vide paragraph 197 of the Memo randum for October.) In connection with the miscellaneous. question of the right Sponge Exploration of the Sultan of Maskat Syndicate. ^ con f er privilege of fishing for sponges, His Highness enquired from the Political Agent whether he would be entitled to receive a share of such produce as might be extracted by the Syndicate outside his territorial waters. The Political Agent at Maskat was informed that the Government of India preferred to wait until a concrete case arose before offering an opinion on the subject.■'tfS 1 1 li \i n On the 18th November, Major Grey mask at. reported that the Sultan Arms traflaio with of Maskat had for- Afghans at—. bidden the Arab arms merchants to sell arms and ammunition to Afghans in future and that the French Consul at Maskat had also issued a circular to the arms merchants connected with his administration forbidding sale to Afghans. Parties of Afghans who subsequently arrived at Maskat with the intention of purchasing arms and ammunition were compelled by the Sultan to return to Karachi. Major Grey stated that the highly satisfactory attitude assumed by His Highness the Sultan in this connection was the result of the action taken by the French Government upon a reference made to them in March 1907, regarding the conduct of M. Goguyer. 218. (Vide para. 177, September 1907.) KATIF- On the 12th October Insult offered to 1907, the P liticai British Naval officers Resident in the Persian by Turkish officials at— Gulf poin , ed out that no steps appeared to have been authorised in the direction of obtaining any apology or reparation locally for the affront offered to the Commander of H. M. S. “ Lapwing ” by the Turkish authorities at Katif. He accord ingly invited the Government of India to consider the expediency of asking His Majesty’s Government to induce the Porte to arrange for the accord of some overt local act of apology. On the 13th November 1907, His Excel lency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, stated that he entirely con curred in the recommendation of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and that he was addressing the Admiralty on the subject with a view to Their Lordships supporting any representation the Indian Government might make. On the 2nd December 1907, the views of the Naval Commander-in-Chief were com municated by telegraph to the Secretary of State for India. 219. In a report submitted by the Acting KOWEIT. British Consul at Jeddah Mecca Pilgrim Caravan, to His Britannic Maj esty’s Ambassador at Constantinople it was stated that an Englishman who had accom panied the Koweit-Haj Caravan Kasim. was living in2 the presence of a European at Kasim. He however stated that a report had reached Baghdad from Nasariyeh on the Euphrates that a European had arrived at Kasim, that the tribesmen had not allowed him to settle there, and that nothing could be found out as to what had become of him. On the 4th December 1907, Major Ramsay further reported that Mr. Consul Crow, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, who had been asked to furnish information on the subject, had informed him that he bad not been able to obtain reliable information, but that there was a man living in the Muntafik country known as Abdalla-el-Eathal who claimed to have been an American subject. Mr. Van Ess, the American Missionary living at Basrah, thought however that be was an Englishman by birth. It was also reported that Ids name was Williamson and that he had become a Muhammadan and had lived amongst the Arabs for about nine years. Major Ramsay stated that he had met a Sheikh from Nejd who had told him that a European had been wandering about his country, but he could not say whether he was an Englishman or not. He appeared to be interested in sur veying and was willing to buy engraved stones at high prices. The Sheikh added that the foreigner who spoke through an Interpreter had invited him to his camp, but that he was not able to accept the invitation. From an Indian resident of Baghdad Major Ramsay ascertained that the foreigner was supposed to be an Englishman who excavated as well as surveyed, that he was at Aga and Selma in the Jabal Tai, and that the last news of him was that he had gone to visit Ibn Saud. 220. (Vide para. 181 of the Memo- Piracy in the Persian randum for Septem- Guif. her.) On the 21st November, the Secretary of State telegraphed that the Legation at Tehran had been in formed that, although the sufferers in the Dayir piracy case were Persian subjects, yet the British Government had vital interests in the suppression of piracy in the Gulf waters and that as regards the Koweit piracy case the British Government were bound to extend their good offices to Koweit. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was therefore instructed again to make strong representa tions to the Persian Government with a view to the capture and punishment of the pirates and the securing of pecuniary reparation for the Koweiti sufferers. He was further instructed to add that, failing compliance, suitable naval action w r ould be taken for the capture and delivery of the offenders to the Persian authorities. At the request of the Foreign Office the Admiralty instructed H. M. S. “ Highflyer ’J \w \ r\ 3 to proceed at once to Dayir with a view to the capture of the pirates at sea, hut with authority to land a force at Dayir, or else where in the Persian Gulf, if necessary. On the 10th December, it was reported that the “ Highflyer ” had captured the pirate dhows and also two of the three pirate brothers, the third brother having escaped inland. As it was discovered that the prisoners were Arab subjects of the Sheikh of Moham- merah, Major Cox suggested that they should be handed over to him for disposal instead of to the Persian authorities at Bushire. His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires at Tehran ascer tained that the Persian Government would raise no objection and accordingly authorised the adoption of this course. The men were handed over at Mohammerah on the 17th December, and the Sheikh on receiving them stated that he was familiar with their ante cedents and guilt and that he intended to imprison them for life. 221. In November last, the Political T . . Resident in the Persian to Messrs. Wonckhaus Gull reported that a &amp; Co - space on the river bank, just below the town of Mohammerah, had been leased to Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., as a corn-wharf for eight years, at the end of which period any brick or mud building on the ground w r as to pass to the landlord. If the ground were not required for building, the firm bad the right of refusal at rent offered by others. The ground was reported to be 40 metres in length and 100 metres deep, two metres right of way being left on the bank.PERSIAN GULP. 10. In connection with the Dayir Piracy Piracy in the Persian case {vide paragraph 220 of the Memorandum for December), the Resident at Bushire stated that it was clearly demonstrated by previous records and subsequent enquiries that, since their expulsion from Mohammerah territory and subsequently from Koweit, the pirates had been enabled to live in security and carry on their profession with impunity by reason of the countenance and shelter accorded to them by Jamal Khan, the Chief of Dashti, and his lieutenant and relatives at the posts of Dayir and Rangoon. Major Cox considered that, unless punishment was accorded to this family, the proceedings would not be complete. Captain Hickley considered that certainly at Dayir, and in all probability at Kangoon, the mud castle of the Khan could be demolished at sufficiently close range by one of H. M.’s Ships to avoid risk of damaging unoffending villagers, who would be given adequate notice. The Resident suggested for consideration teat, if possible, with the concurrence of the Persian Government, and, if necessary, without it, an ultimatum should be presented to Jamal Khan, who was then at one of his coast ports, calling upon him to pay a fine of Rs. 15,000 through the British Residency, for distribution among the families known to have lost relatives or merchandise in piracies, and informing him that, failing compliance, ships would forthwith take action as suggested above. Major Cox further considered tnat, if the British ships were accompanied for the sake of appearance by the “ Persepolis ” so much the better, but it was feared that she was in such a condition that she could not be used. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was authorised by His Majesty’s Government to approach the Persian Government and to suggest the presence of a Persian official on board H. M.’s Ship. The Persian Government, however, declined assistance in the matter, asserting their willingness to undertake the destruction of the strongholds themselves. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs held that, in view of the present political con ditions in Persia and of the success of the measures taken to secure the surrender of the pirates, is would be impolitic to pursue the matter further by threatening to destroy the strongholds or demanding the payment of a fine, and every endeavour was to be made to persuade the Persian Government to take this action.11. {Vide para. 193 of the Memo. AEUMU8A for October 1907.) On Eviction of the con- the 14th November, the cessionaire of the red Secretary of State for India telegraphed that tlie Foreign Office considered it not improb able that the matter of the eviction of the concessionaire of the red oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa would be taken up by the German Government, hut that they did not foresee any difficulty in replying satisfac torily to any representations that might be made. On the 17th November, the Political Kesident was instructed to advise the Sheikh to keep a guard on the island until he was advised that he could safely remove it, and the Secretary of State was informed that in a letter from Mr. Wonckhaus to the Sheikh of Shargah the former asserted a formal claim that the mines and concession were security for advances made by him. This claim, if conceded, would have given Messrs. VYonckhaus territorial rights in Abu Musa in direct con tradiction to clause 3 of the Protectorate Treaty signed by the Chief of Shargah in 1892. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires subse quently telegraphed to the Foreign Office stating that the German Consul, Bushire, had sent his Dragoman with a letter to the Sheikh of Shargah refusing to recognise the cancellation of the red oxide concession on Abu Musa and threatening a claim to heavy indemnity on behalf of Wonckhaus. On 6th November, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was informed by the German Minister of Wonckhaus’ complaint against the action of the Sheikh, and Mr. Marling gave him a memorandum explaining the facts of the case, and pointing out that the contract of Wonckhaus was invalid. This move was considered by Mr. Marling to be an ill-chosen attempt to dispute the British position in the Gulf. On the 31st December, Mr. Marling stated that it was asserted by the German Charge d’Affaires, that iv. r. Brown, a German subject, had been fired on. The third partner, Esa- bin-Abdul Latif, he also declared, had written a private letter to Hassan Samaiyeh agreeing to the Wonckhaus contract. To this Major Cox replied that, in the beginning, at Mr. Brown’s express bidding, the Lingali con cessionaire had carefully kept the text of the German contract secret, and in writing to his friends had suppressed the fact that the monopoly had been conferred therein. As the purport of the document was thus misrepresented to him, it was quite possible that the third concessionaire might Lave agreed to the mere sale of some oxide toWonckhaus, but on learning the precise text of the document he at once repudiated it. If Hassan had such a letter as that sug gested, and if it was of any value, he might have sued his co-partner on it in the Resi dency Court, since both parties were British subjects under the jurisdiction of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. In any case it was considered that this question was one between the partners them selves, and could not be said to concern the Germans, whose complaint was against the action of the Sheikh of Sharga. The said action was based not on the question whether the third partner did or did not agree to the German contract, but on the fact that the said contract conferred a monopoly which the concessionaires, whether two or three, had no power to give, and to which the Sheikh alto gether objected. As regards the alleged firing on Mr. Brown, the following were the facts reported :—On 22nd October, the son and miners of the Lingah concessionaire were evicted from the mines and despatched to Lingah and a strong guard was then left on the island by the Sheikh of Sharga with orders not to allow anyone to land at the mines. Meanwhile, Mr. Brown, who had previously sent a letter to the Sheikh threatening to send over his own employes “ to protect our property *' and who, it was stated, before leaving Bahrein informed persons in Lingah that he intended to plant the German flag on the oxide mines, proceed ed to the island in a native boat dying the German flag, and anchored off the oxide mines. In spite of repealed warnings shouted to him by Sheikh’s guard that he would not be allowed to land, he persisted in attempting to do so, and as he neared the shore the guard therefore fired two shots in the air to deter him. On his expostulating at this and assur ing them that he only wished to see how matters stood, the guard allowed two of his men to land and see all they wished and then escorted them back to the boat; Brown sailed back to Lingah after this and the incident closed. On the 7th January, the Secretary of State for India was informed that the Resident considered that the proper course for the aggrieved party to follow would be to institute a suit in the Residency Court or at any rate refer the matter to the Resident. The Government of India concurred in this. Messrs. Wonckhaus and also both con cessionaires, who were naturalised British subjects, were well aware that the Sheikh of Sharga w as under the Resident’s political juris diction. Mr. Wonckhaus himself, in a somewhat similar case in Bahrein in 1905,invoked the assistance of the Resident. His departure in this instance from ordinary procedure and previous precedent appeared to indicate some ulterior motive from the outset. The Government of India trusted that the case would be discussed in London with the German Ambassador since they anticipated that, otherwise, the German Minister at Tehran might instigate a revival of the Persian claims to the island. The expectation of the Government of India as to this had been fulfilled, and it seemed particularly desirable therefore that further discussion of the case at Tehran should, if possible, be stopped. The Government of India recommended, if the incident was likely to be further pro tracted, that Mr. Marling should inform the German Minister that the Trucial Chiefs were under the jurisdiction of the Resident and that complaints of their proceedings should at any rate in the first instance be preferred to him. The fact that Messrs. Wonckhaus* agent had endeavoured to deal direct with the Sheikh in matter, and had throughout made no reference to Persian Gov ernment, would probably render it difficult for the Germans to press for Persian inter ference at this stage. The Government of India attached great importance to the maintenance of the Resident’s authority and jurisdiction over the Trucial Chiefs. He was not under the Minister at Tehran in regard to them. Pinally the facts of case were well known at Bushire where Mr. Brown had the assistance of the German Consul. In connection with a rumour that Messrs. Wonckhaus intended to send a vessel to remove the accumulated red oxide, the Secre tary of State telegraphed that the greatest caution uas necessary pending an examination of the German case, and Mr. Marling was instructed that Messrs. Wonckhaus should be allowed in any case and without conditions to ship all accumulated oxide and that the Sheikh of Shargah should be informed. On the 9th January, a further telegram was addressed to the Secretary of State stating that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the Sheikh of Sharga had failed to maintain guards effectively on the island owing to apathy and disinclination to incur expense. He suggested either that the Gov ernment of India should buy or lease the island from the Sheikh by secret document or that, with a view to the maintenance of a guard, they should subsidise the third concessionaire, Esa bin Abdul Latif, who was incensed at the conduct of his co-partner. If the Sheikh con sented, Esa bin Abdul Latif would undertakeI to live on the island with a guard and represent the Sheikh’s interests. The Government of India might privately supply the funds for the guard, but they hesitated to suggest any movement at present which might throw doubt upon the correct nature of their pro ceedings, and though they thought that some thing might be made of Esa, the partner not concerned in the monopoly granted to Messrs. Wonckhaus, they would prefer to leave matters as they were until things settled down, only taking measures by the deputation of a gun boat to secure that forcible possession of the island was not taken either by the Persian Government or Messrs. Wonckhaus, or the concessionaires. In view of the position of the island and the recent stranding of steamer “ Bulimba” there, it might be as well for the Government of India to place a lighthouse on the island later on. This would probably be sufficient to protect the interests of the British Government and the Sheikh. The Government of India were still of opinion that w r hen the incident was closed arrangements should be made to sell the ore freely and without special monopoly or concession to anyone. From a sketch of the case given verbally to Mr. Marling by the German Chargd d’Affaires, the former was of opinion that Major Cox had a very complete answer. f J he German Charge d’Affaires stated that he had informed his Consul at Bushire in Nov ember that the Sheikh of Sharga was under British protection and instructed him to act accordingly, but it appeared that the Consul had deliberately ignored the British protec torate over the Sheikh. On the 10th January, the Secretary of State for India telegraphed that it would be desirable that some official should visit Abu Musa to ensure that, without trouble or conflict with the Sheikh or his men, all proper facilities were given to Messrs. Wonckhaus for removing the accumulation of oxide already mined from the island. The Sheikh was duly warned and the German Consul promised to give early intimation as soon as it was desired to send a ship for the purpose. 12. As it was considered advisable that Inspection of the the . meteorological Meteorological stations stations in the Persian in the Persian Gulf. ^ Gulf should be inspect _ ed for the comparison of instruments and6 Baghdad were apprised of the intention, and were requested to make the necessary arrange ments on account of the visit. His Britannic Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires, Tehran, accord ingly instructed the Persian Government who telegraphed to the competent authorities to give the inspecting officer every facility. Lala Hem Raj sailed from Karachi for the Gulf on the 14th December 1907, and after having completed his tour without difficulty returned to India on the 4th January 1908. rPERSIAN GULF. 21. {Vide paragraph 207, November Overcrowding of pil- d907.) On 23rd Janu.- gnm ships from the ary, the Political Resi- Persxan Gulf. ^ p ers i an Gulf transmitted to the Government of India with his support a suggestion made by the Residency Surgeon in his capacity of Chief Quarantine Officer, which was intended to meet the complaints of the overcrowding of pilgrim ships proceeding to Camaran, the matter having on this occasion been raised by the Persian Foreign Office Agent at Bushire. The proposal was that an official communication should be addressed by the Resident to the Chief Quarantine Officer who would then enlist the support of the Sanitary Council in obtain ing orders from the Persian Government for the adoption of measures to prevent over crowding, by the enforcement of the Indian Pilgrim Ships Actor the Turkish Regulations as the case might be. On the arrival of any Pilgrim Ship at a Persian port the passengers would then be counted and the Agents informed how many more might be embarked. The Government of India informed Major Cox that they considered that there were elements of considerable risk in the proposals of the Residency Surgeon, and that they were not prepared, without further experience, to modify the opinions already expressed to His Majesty’s Government on the 14th March 1907. 22. In connection with the question of Brussels Arms Traffic the suppression of arms Conference, 1908. traffic in Africa, the Secretary of State for India, on the 18th Dec ember 1907, intimated that a preliminary meeting of the forthcoming Brussels Conference would be held early in February with the French, German and Italian representatives. The Government of India were invited specially to consider the following points:— (I) the imposition of duty on Arms at Aden. (II) The amendment of the Aden Regu lation of 1902. (III) How far the provisions of the Somaliland Regulation could be made appli cable to the coast of the Aden Protectorate. (1Y) Question of the international control of the Arms traffic at Maskat with special reference to the independence of the Sultan and the maintenance of British Poli tical influence there. (Y) The possibility of framing rules other than those contained in the Aden and Somaliland Regulations.2 (VI) The machinery suggested for the due enforcement by the Sultan of Maskat of any rules that might be adopted. Special reports were called for as to— (а) How far there was any lawful trade in Arms at Aden. (б) The procedure followed in respect of dhows authorised to fly the Eritish flag. (c) The practice from ports of the Aden Protectorate in respect to the flying of flags, followed by dhows not authorised to fly the British flag and the extent to which it was practicable to control their movements. It was stated that the international Bureau, under the Brussels Act, possessed no executive functions. After communication with the local authorities, the Viceroy replied on the 2nd February that at Aden the existing trade in arms was so small and could so easily be con trolled that the imposition of duty on arms there was not likely to have any useful result, but if it w r as considered advisable to include Aden in the scheme in order to facilitate its adoption by the European Powers concerned, there w r as no objection. It was added that the revision of the Aden Regulation was almost completed and a copy of the draft had been forwarded to the India Office. The Government of India had not hitherto considered the question of embodying in it provisions similar to those in Part III of the Somali land Regulation, as they contemplated applying the Indian Arms Act to the Protec torate. The desired object would then have been secured by the issue of executive instructions to Commanders of vessels concerned. The Secretary of State had, however, desired the Government of India to defer action regarding the application of Indian Acts to the Protec torate, and they were prepared, if the Arms Act should not be applied, instead to embody the provisions of Part III, Somaliland Regula tion. If, however, these provisions were to be seriously enforced on the protectorate coast line, it would probably be necessary to institute a coast patrol and to occupy Ras-el-Arah and possibly other points on the coast of the Protectorate. But there w r ould be little need for precautionary measures on the Aden coast against the distribution, if the importation of arms were once stopped at the main distribu ting centre Jibuti. Though this w as not stated in the proposals the Government of India presumed the provisions of the General Act would be applied also 1 o the portion of Arabian Coast between the Red Sea and Gulf of Oman. The Resident, it was stated, was furnishing a report regarding the control of dhows. Some -r15 3 international measures to facilitate the identi fication of dhows seemed necessary in the opinion of the Government of India. The Government of India were not, it was added, specially interested in Aden, however, and they recognised that measures taken there must be such as to meet British necessities in Africa. As regards Maskat and the Persian Gulf the case was very different. There it was of immense importance to the Government of India, as well as to Turkey and Persia to stop the trade. The Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhs had prohi bited the import of arms into their territories, and this was also contraband in Persia and Turkey. Maskat was the only place where it was licit, and here international jealousies alone had prevented a similar prohibition. The Sultan was actively co-operating with the British authorities by prohibiting the landing of Pathan arms traders at Maskat and the Government of India believed that his action was largely to be ascribed to the support given to the British by France. If that support was continued, he might agree to prohibit the trade altogether at present. It was suggested that before the conference met, France if not also the other Powers possessing commercial treaties with Maskat, might be induced to agree to an amendment of the treaties and prohibition of import of arms. Great Britain, as the Power most interested, would meet the cost of com pensating the Sultan for the loss of his Customs duty on arms, and in return for this might induce him, with the consent of France, to entrust his Customs management to the Government of India or at any rate to appoint a British officer as Superinten dent of Customs. The Government of India invited attention to Major Cox’s views of the danger of doing anything to endanger British predominant control at Maskat. If the measures such as those already placed before the Secretary of State could be adopted, the British Government could show the Powers that effective steps had been taken to stop the traffic at Maskat and in the Gulf generally, and it might then be possible, while applying the General Act to the area, to abstain from taking further steps internation ally therein. The Government of India suggested the following remarks if the course indicated above was impracticable and the case of the Persian Gulf must come before the conference for full discussion :— (a) The representation of the Sultan at the Brussels conference. The Government of India did not know what was intended, but4 presumably, in view of the Sultan’s nominal independence, some form of representation would be necessary. The Omani delegate could hardly appear alone, as he would speedily fall under the tutelage of some foreign Power. The Goyernment of India recommended that Sultan should, if possible, be represented by a British officer, or, failing this, by British and French officers jointly. (b) The International bureau would pre sumably be constituted on the lines of the inter- mtional office for slave trade, described in Articles XXVII and LXXIV—LXXX of the General Act. The danger of foreign inter ference might be reduced if international control meant nothing more than the establish ment of such an office for registering inform ation at Jibuti. It would be desirable, however, that the establishment of an auxiliary office on the analogy of that mentioned in Article LXXIX should not be permitted at Maskat. (c) Scope for foreign interference might be provided by the framing of any articles similar to Articles XLII to XLI re garding the detention of suspected vessels and examination and trial of vessels seized. It was considered that His Majesty’s Govern ment would doubtless not agree to any article which might facilitate German Consular or other action at Maskat or interference by foreign ships of war with native craft in the Gulf of Oman. (d) The important point, as regards the actual control of traffic at Maskat, was to get the Sultan to agree to prohibit the importation of arms and ammunition. His consent could be obtained when the international Agreement proposed was concluded, but the abolition of traffic would involve a heavy loss to him of income from Customs duties and unless he were indemnified for this he might be expected passively to obstruct measures for the preven tion of arms traffic. The Government of India recommended that arrangements for compensa tion should be entrusted to them, as they, with Turkey and Persia, were the main if not only sufferers from Maskat trade. Payments of a sub sidy by the Powers jointly would be a calamity and a serious disturbance of the status qno would inevit'tbly follow. Perhaps the Sultan might be induced to appoint a British officer as Superintendent of his Customs in order to ensure the effective prohibition of import by thorough Customs examination. It was estimated by the Political Agent, Maskat, that fair indemnity for the Sultan’s loss of income would be £12,000 per annum. Major .Cox thought it might be less. (e) If the Sultan agreed to prohibit arms traffic and his Customs administration were A t* * S'5 strengthened it was considered that it would be easy to draw up simple rules on the lines of the Aden Regulation, which with the Proclamation against import, would seem to be all that was necessary. The prohibition against inland traffic would not be required and could not he enforced by the Sultan. The important point was to stop the import of arms into Maskat in hulk. (/) If it appeared that the wholesale trade w r as being shifted to other ports in the Gulf such as Bahrein or Koweit, the Government of India could take measures by the control of the Customs or otherwise to make effective the prohibitions already issued by the Sheikhs. International action at such ports would there fore he not only undesirable, but unneces sary, as the Government of India would be responsible in the matter. On the 13th February, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India was informed that as regards dhows flying the British flag, Article X of 1841, under which registration^ was effected at Aden, had been held to he ultra vires and would he replaced by a Bill which had been proposed with the object of providing a suitable form of registration for vessels of that description and the drafting of which the Secretary of State had agreed to subject to the latest remarks of the Board of Trade. This enactment would afford means of identification and would considerably facili tate the registration of native craft generally. In connection with indemnifying the Sultan of Maskat, Major Cox recommended an offer to double the subsidy of Rs. 7,200 per mensem and to gradually raise it, as necessary^ up to a yearly sum of £15,000. On the 18th February, the Secretary of State for India enquired whether the Gov ernment of India could depute Major Grey, or some officer with a knowTedge of the local conditions of Maskat, to attend the Brussels conference to he held at the beginning of April, and on the 21st the Government of India replied in the affirmative. On the 29th February, the Secretary of State intimated that the 28th April had been fixed as the proposed date of the meeting of the conference at Brussels. 23. On the 20th December 1907, the Somaliland Arms Secretary of State for Traffic. India telegraphed that the Italian Government proposed to send an Agent to Maskat to organise a service of information regarding the contraband trade in arms between Maskat and Italian Somaliland. The Political Agent at Maskat was accordingly instructed to afford him any facilities he might require, and the Secretary of State w^as informed that the Government of India saw no eqfootion to the proposal.PERSIAN GULP. 38. (Vide para. 11, January 1908.) Abu Musa red oxide On the 10th January, concession. His Majesty s secre tary of State forwarded, for criticism and correction of the statement of facts in the German case, papers regarding the Abu Musa affair. The observations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf were invited, and the latter, on the 1st March, submitted material for a rejoinder to the German arguments. On the 21st March a telegram to the following effect was despatched to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India :— With reference to the first German point, viz., that Salim, uncle of Sheikh Sagar, was the owner of the mines, and that as the lease was given by him to a company in his capacity as owner, Sagar had no right^ to annul it—- it was pointed out that nothing in support of this allegation was to be found in the papers forwarded with the German case. The history of the island showed that it was an integral part of the dominions of the Sheikh of Shargah, and Sheikh Sagar, in two letters to the Resident in 1881, referred to the fact that Salim only resided on the island on sufferance It was a fact that, by personal and verbal arrangement with Sagar, Salim did enjoy the income of Abu Musa since Sugar ouste him from the Sheikhdom. Sagar admitted this, and said that Salim had also been allowed by him to retain the rent for the mines paid under the terms of the contract now in ques tion, in order to stop Salim’s^ complaints as to the inadequate allowance given by Sagar. But all right of ownership of the island had now categorically been disclaimed by Salim in a letter to Sagar, dated the 21st February 1908, and bo had declared that in granting the lease’he merely acted as proxy for Sagar. An examination of the Agreements of 1883 1884, and 1889, between Sagar and Salim, supported the genuineness of this declaration. Further, the Sheikh in a letter K Resident, dated the 11th October 1902, referred to the fact that Salim had leased the produce of the mines, while acting as Regent in Shargah. f The German argument based on Salim s rights could not therefore be maintained. ° 39 As regards the second German point, viz., that even if power to grant a lease Lanated from the Sheikh, his cancellation ot it was uninstifiable—it was stated that the Sheikh was a law to himself, and had absolute right to do as he liked, subject to such general control as was exercised by the British Gov- ernment** The Sheikh’s territorial rights over the island had been admitted by the Germans;2 and the agreement, nnder which he personally took a commercial share in the undertaking, was for so long as the mines were workable and in lease, and nothing limited his right as Sheikh to cancel the lease at will. The Sheikh’s reasons for cancelling the lease were good. In the first place, the grant of a monopoly to a foreigner was not contem plated in the lease ; the Sheikh had received a general warning from the Political Resident not to grant trade monopolies without consult ing him, and a special warning was given in December 1904) by the Residency Agent at Shargah, against dealing with Messrs. Wonckhaus without reference to the Resident. Secondly, the monopoly had been given by Hassan Samaiyeh without the consent of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, a partner, who accord ingly complained to the Sheikh of being ignored. The Germans claimed that Esa had really known and approved of the grant of the contract; but this was not borne out by the documents forwarded. On the 1st June 1906, a deed of contract between Ilassan Samaiyeh and the German firm was executed. Under this deed a monopoly of purchase for four years was given to the German firm, and a preference for a new contract on the expiry of the old one. Hassan, in reporting the agreement on the 11th June 1906 to Esa’s father, Abdul Latif, Residency Agent, Shargah, concealed the existence of a monopoly and preferential right to renew. It was significant that this letter had been omitted from the German case. In replying on the 14th June, Abdul Lath requested Hassan to refrain from making leases or deeds of contract with the German. On 26th June, Mr. Malcolm, who bad en gagements with the concessionaires, asked Hassan for a copy of the agreement, and en quired whether similar contracts could be entered into with oilier European firms. In replying on the 13th July, Hassan evaded both points; and in a letter, dated the 14th October 1906, to Mr. Malcolm, he refused to send a copy of the agreement, and said that the German had directed that the transaction should be kept secret. He was finally persuaded to give a copy to the Residency Agent, Lingah, at the end of October 1906; but it w as not till the 16th December 1906 that he sent a copy to Abdul Latif. On receipt of this docu ment Abdul Latif wrote on the* 23rd January 1907, saying that his son, Esa, did not agree to the contract and desired its nullification; and on the 20th February Esa himself wrote to Sheikh Sagar asking for the cancellation of the contract. In a letter to Abdul Latif, dated the 8th March 1907, Hassan asserted that he had communicated details of the agreement to Abdul Latif at the time of its execution,w 3 and that the latter had then written ap proving ; there was, however no evidence of either letter or reply. 40. In respect to the third German claim, riz., that, in any case, the consent of Esa or the other partners to the action taken by Hassan was not necessary, as the latter was managing partner on behalf of the others— evidence produced by Major Cox disproved this, and the argument put forward was further weakened by the fact that the dragoman of the German Consulate went to Bander Abbas on 25th November 1907, and, apparently without success, tried to induce Nejef-bin-Ali, a claim ant to a share in the concession, to sign a document agreeing to the sub-contract. 41. It was pointed out that Mr. Wonckhaus had endeavoured to strengthen his case by securing an actual share in the original concession. The purchase of this share however did not in any way diminish the Sheikh’s right to determine the lease, as it was effected after the arrangements for the cancellation of the lease had been made, and was clearly a mere afterthought. It afforded an argument in justification of the Sheikh’s action, since, by its terms, the German firm was admitted, without the Sheikh’s consent, to a leasehold interest in the island. This was contrary to the assur ance given to the Political Resident by the Sheikh, that he would allow no such thing without the knowledge of the British Govern ment, and it might have led to an infringe ment of the Treaty of 1892. 42. On the 4th March, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India invited the suggestions of the Government of India as to the future working of the concession on Abu Musa. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who was consulted, replied that, as he understood the position, no conces sion now existed; and it seemed better, having regard to German susceptibilities, that some time should elapse before any fresh concession were given. Major Cox recommended the introduction to the Sheikh, as soon as circum stances permitted, of a trustworthy British subject or firm, who would manage the mining and sales on his behalf on suitable terms which the Residency could negotiate; and the Government of India, in replying to the Secretary of State, endorsed this suggestion. 43. On the 21st March, the Political Resident telegraphed that the German Consul had informed him that, according to a com munication received from Berlin, the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the removal of the accumulation of oxide {vide para. 11, January 1908) covered all oxide already excavated on the island. He therefore asked Major Cox to arrange for theremoval, not only of the oxide lying on the shore “ ready for shipment ”, but also (rt that lyinc inland. Major Cox informed him in reply that the previous correspondence ana bis instructions appeared to him only to refer to the former oxide and not to any other, but that the Consul’s communication would be referred to Government and that he would address him again on receipt of further instructions. Major Cox did not consider that Messrs. Wonckhaus had any legitimate claim to this other oxide. lo bring it to the shore would, he stated, take several weeks, and until it was cleaned its weight could not be satisfactorily estimated. He was of opinion that it would create a very prejudicial effect if any access whatever to the inland oxide were permitted to the German firm or Hassan during the visit of the ship for the removal of that lying cm the sea shore, and he trusted that the British Government would see their way to refuse to entertain the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus to the inland oxide or, failing that, to answeT that there were other claims upon it which would have to be considered quite separately, after an examination of the concessionaires’ books. On the 26th March, the Government of India recommended to the Secretary of State that only the oxide on the shore lying ready for shipment should be taken_ by the ship visiting the island, and that Major Cox should be instructed to submit separately proposals as regards that lying inland near the mines. On the same day a telegram was received from the Resident to the effect that the German vessel would probably reach Abu Musa about the 10th April. He pointed out that, in view of urgencies elsewhere, it might prove difficult for the Navy to provide a ship to remain at Abu Musa during the visit of the German vessel, and the Resident was therefore author ised to send the British representative in the R. I. M. S. “ Lawrence.” 44. (Fide para. 10, January 1908.) On the 19th February Dayir piracy case. a telegram was received from the Secretary of State enquiring whether the Government of India agreed to a proposal by the Foreign Office that an expression of appreciation should be conveyed to the Persian Govern ment in regard to the services of the Khan of Bander Rig, who had greatly assisted in the capture of the Dayir pirates. It was also BU^ested that the Government of India should make the Khan a small present. The Political Resident at Bushire reported that he had already given the Khan a handsome gold watch ; but he considered that an expression of appreciation from His Majesty’s Government to the Persian Government would benefit theKhan, especially if the fact of its having been conveyed might be intimated to him by the Resident. The Secretary of State has now telegraphed that appreciation of the Khan’s services will he conveyed to the Persian Government by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, who will inform Major Cox when this has been done, in order that the Khan mav he informed bv that officer. » « 45. [Fide para. 218, December KA.TIF. 19 ° 7 ^ 0n the 3rd insult offered to January 1908, the British Navo officers Secretary of State for by Turkish officials at— T t , i . , « India telegraphed to the Government of India that Sir N. O’Conor had been instructed by despatch to inform the Porte that, the El Katif incident would not be regarded as closed till a formal apology had been made by the offending officials to the Commander of H. M. S. “Lapwing” for the discourtesy shown to him The despatch suggested the desirability of the Wali of Basrah being instructed by his Government to furnish an open letter to Lieutenant-Com mander Gouldsmith, containing peremptory orders to the El Katif officials to proceed on board IT. M. S. “ Lapwimr ” at an hour and date convenient to the Officer in Command, and tender a formal apology, both in writing and in person, for their previous misconduct. On the 21st January 1908, Sir N. O’Conor reported to Sir E Grey that, as the result of his representations made to the Porte in August, the Wali of Basrah, while expressing his keen regret for what had occurred, had informed His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah that there was no Kaimakam at El Katif at the time of the incident, the post being in charge of a certain Avni Effendi, whom he had removed. The Wali stated that from his enquiries it appeared that the Captain of the port was chiefly to blame in the matter, and that he had been suspended for three months. On receipt of further instructions from the Minister of the Interior, the Wali had wTitten officially to His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah and informed him that instructions in writing had been sent to the present Kaimakam of El Katif to tender a formal apology to the Com mander of H. M. S. “Lapwing” on his next visit. The Minister of the Interior informed Sir N. O’Conor that his instructions were such that if His Majesty’s Government thought it desirable, the Kaimakam would make the apology to the _ Commander of any other of His Majesty’s ships that might call at El Katif in the meantime. In view of the possibility that H. M. S. “ Lapwing ” might not return to El Katif for some time, and that if no apology were tendered until her return, the incident might by that time be so remote that the apology would not have due effect locally, Sir N. O’Conor was6 instructed to request that it should he made to the first British warship calling at that port. On the 14th March, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, was requested by the Government of India by telegraph to order a ship to proceed to El Katif for the purpose. It was suggested that her Commander might discuss the matter with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf before taking action. The Political Resident was informed accordingly, and was requested to ascertain from the Consul at Basrah, before the ship started for El Katif, whether clear instructions had been received by the Kaimakam. 46. {Vide para, 196, October 1907.) Nejd and Koweit af- On the 1st Pebruary fairs- 1908, Major Knox, the Political Agent at Koweit, reported on the present situation in Nejd, with special refer ence to Sheikh Mubarak’s intervention in the feud between Bin Rashid and Bin Saud. It was stated that Sheikh Mubarak did intervene effectually and somewhat treacherously, through his Agent, Abdul Aziz-ul-Hassan, by detaching the Umtair tribe from Bin Rashid and gen erally by lulling the party’s suspicions by false assurances of benevolent intervention, while at the same time he informed Bin Saud that it was a good opportunity to attack his enemies. Major Knox was of opinion that Sheikh Muba rak was behind the scenes throughout, that he encouraged the Bin Rashid faction to make head against Bin Saud with a view to showing the latter Chieftain that he was not strong enough to stand alone and was still in need of Mubarak’s assistance, and that when he saw that matters had gone far enough and that Bin Saud had leiirnt his lesson, he shamelessly deceived Bin Rashid and his friends and delivered them to Bin Saud. Major Knox was further of opinion that Sheikh Mubarak would continue to inter fere in Nejd politics as an intriguer, though he did not think that there was any reason to fear a repetition of an expedition from Koweit after the 'Larif disaster. The pretensions of Sheikh Mubarak to act as keeper of the peace between Bin Rashid and Bin Saud should not, in the Political Agent’s opinion, be treated too seriously. News from Nejd was reported to be very scanty, and Major Knox had heard nothing that would lead him to anticipate at present any further disturbance of the peace. 47. The Political Resident in Turkish „ „ , xr Arabia has received a burg-American line of Visit from a Mr. Paust Reamers in the Persian Laurion, who describes u ' himself as an Austrian, naturalised in England, and as a Director of the West Hartlepool Line of Steamers. Mr.f?l 7 Laurion stated that, according to his calcula tions, the Hamburg-American Line must he losing about £20,000 a year on their Persian Gulf Service. He said that he had been nego tiating on behalf of the British Combine with the Hamburg-American Directorate, and that he thought that, before long, an agreement would he come to by which the British steamers would not go to Hamburg, Antwerp or Rotterdam, and that the German steamers would not go to Marseilles or to any port in the United Kingdom.PERSIAN GULF. 63. (Vide para. £3, February 19'ft.) With reference to the jW AotxAI* Tx.1* Proposed appointment pr&lt; posul 01 the Itiilmn of an Italian Consul at Government to send an Agent to Masknt to organise a service of information regard ing the arms traffic to Somaliland, tl:e Italian Ambassador, on the 2nd January 190S, intimated that it was now the intention of his Government to found at Maskat a regular official Consular Agency, and it wns stated that Cavaliere Francesco Crispi, Captain of the Royal Colonial Troops, had been appointed Consular Agent. The Italian Government asked for the co-operation locally of the British Government, both with reference to the Agent’s ordinary duties, and as regards the arms traffic. The Government of India, whose views were invited as to the answer to be given to the Italian Government, referred the question to the Political Resident at Bushire, who expressed the opinion that there appeared to be no adequate grounds for the a- ceptance of a Consul, and suggested that a trusted and secret Native Agent would be much more likely to effect the object aimed at. He enquired whether the matter could not, at any rate, be postponed until the close of the Arms Traffic Conference. In replying to the Secretary of State, the Government of India endorsed the latter suggestion, agreeing with the views expressed by the Resident, as to the desirability of inducing the Italian Govern ment to substitute a native news-agent for a Consular officer. 64. The Directors of the British India maskat. Steam Navigation Arms traffic at—. Company, Limited, have issued instructions forbidding the convey ance of Afghans to Maskat by any of the Company’s steamers. 65. ( Vide para. maskat. Brussels Arms Traffic Conference. 21 y February 1908.) Major W. G. Grey, Political Agent at Maskat, and Captain VV. S. Bowman, R. N., late of H. M.

(Vide para. 43, March 1908.) On Abu Musa red oxide the 6th April, the Poli- concession. tical Resident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed that the R.I.M.S. “Lawrence” and tl.e German steamer had left for Abu Musa. He added that the German Consul, in a communication received2 on the 1st April, again pressed for an estimation of the weight of the oxide lying inland at the mines, but Major Cox replied that his negotiations with the Sheikh had only governed the 2,000 odd tons lying on the beach, and that lie could not guarantee the safe operation of the steamer, if any access to the mines were permitted. The latest news was that the amount of oxide lying on the beach was nearer 3,000 than 2,000 tons and that the present steamer would not be able to remove it all. On the same date, the Secretary of State for India telegraphed that it was necessary, in view of communications made to Berlin, to permit the removal of all the oxide which had been excavated, and that Major Cox should arrange for the work of cleaning, bringing the mineral to the shore, &amp;c., without prejudice to the ultimate settlement. He enquired whether these arrangements could not be ex tended to provide for the contemplated supply of oxide to Messrs. Wonckhaus in 1908-09. The Political Resident, who was consulted, replied that, in the first place, the knowledge that the oxide near the mine was to be re moved by Hassan or Messrs. Wonckhaus would alarm Esa-bin-Abdul Latif and !Nejef- bin-Nakhuda Ali, and would probably throw the last named into the arms of Mr. Brown. He asked whether he might give them an assurance that the British Government would guarantee payment of the sum due on their shares, if their right to a share of the value of this oxide was subsequently proved. Secondly, Major Cox enquired whether His Majesty’s Government, in mentioning an extension of the arrangement for the supply of oxide, contemplated further mining operations. Anything in the latter direction was, in his opinion, to be deprecated, until all the mineral then lying at the mouth of the mine had been transported to the sea coast and weighed. As soon as the ground around the mine had been cleared of the mineral in dispute, mining might, it w r as considered, be commenced under new manage ment. Thirdly, he pointed out that instructions as to the institution of a suit against Hassan by Esa and Nejef had not been received by him, and he apprehended that almost all the account books w r ould have been falsified. He also reported that Abdullah-bin- Hassan had given out that he had been appointed an Agent for the German firm on the '1 rucial Coast, where German ships would call in future. Major Cox did not, however, anticipate that Abdullah would be allowed by the Chiefs to remain in their territories.30 3 The views of the Resident were com municated to the Secretary of State by the Government of India, who endorsed Major Cox’s suggestion for the proposed guarantee to Esa and Nejef, as well as that regarding the future working of the mines. The instruc tions of His Majesty’s Government in the matter of the suit against Hassan were also invited. 67. On the 29th April, the Resident tele graphed that the German steamer “Louise” had carried out her loading undisturbed, but that she was unable to take the whole quantity of red oxide. She, however, removed an amount which Messrs. Wonckhaus and Hassan mutually accepted as being 1,810 tons, leaving a balance on the beach estimated by them as 400 tons. In another telegram of the same date Major Cox reported that, while the ship was loading on April the 12th, in the presence of the Residency Agent, she hoisted the Turkish flag at the fore. On being asked by the Agent what this meant, the Dragoman of the German Consulate denied all knowledge of the incident. An individual who made similar enquiries was informed by Hassan and Abdullah that no Turkish official was on board, but that the flag had been hoisted because the Pirate ports and Abu Musa island belonged to the Turkish Government. The flag was not hoisted except on the 12th April. 68. On the 15th March 1908, a telegram Bahrein. from the Political The floggitig of a Bah- Resident announced Deputy^Governor ‘o® that, according to a Lingah. report received from the Residency Agent at Lingah, the Deputy Governor, who was in the hands of Russian and self-styled Turkish Agents, had flogged and imprisoned a Bahrein subject, entirely refusing to accept the intervention of the British Agent on behalf of Bahreinis. Writing on the 8th March 1908, Major Cox had drawn attention to the fact that M. Waffelaert, the Director-General of Customs, Bushire, in the course of correspondence with the First Assistant, had, “by virtue of Tehran circular No. 1361 of the 4th February 1905,” declined to accept British intervention^ in two cases concerning subjects of the Sheikhs of Abu Dbabi and Shargah. The Political Resident had, in the previous October, requested His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires, Tehran, to whom he had reported the matter, to indicate to the Persian Government that both these Chiefs were under British protection, and to press for the issue of the necessary instructions to M. Watfelaert. 69. On the 24th March 1908, the Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Government of India that the action of the4 Lingah Governor in arbitrarily punishing a British-protected subject of Bahrein would be the subject of a formal protest to the Persian Government by the British Representative at Tehran; and requested that the views of the Political Resident, Bushire, should be obtained as to the action that could be taken locally to vindicate our position with success. On the 28th March 1908, Major Cov telegraphed that His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, had suggested to the Poreign Office that, as the Foreign Agents were more or less beyond the control of their Legations, the Political Resident should be authorised to take moderate action locally; and that, acting upon this suggestion, lie had informed the Persian Government official in charge of the Persian Gulf ports, who was then away on the Mekran coast, that, unless he telegraphed positive assurances that he would remove his subordinate at Lingah, or undertake, on his return journey, to call at the place and bring him to his bearings in connection with this and other matters, the Resident would have to move the British Minister at Tehran to take more comprehensive action. The official in question had, Major Cox reported, in two or three telegrams assured him that he would call at the place as suggested; but, as the subordinate continued hostile, the Political Resident recommended that he should be authorised to inform the official in charge of the Persian Gulf ports that he had been directed to insist upon the subordinate’s removal and non-re-employment in the Persian Gulf and to demand compensation in the present case. He explained that, as regards the general question, although the central Gov ernment had never relinquished their claim to the ownership of Bahrein, still, before the inauguration of the constitution and the freedom of the Press, a reasonable amount of intervention locally by friendship and informal means was possible. Since the establishment of these institutions, however, ignorant local officials, inflated with nationalist sentiment and anti-Foreign newspaper articles, and often directly prompted by members of the young Persian party and Foreign Agents, disputed our right to protect subjects of Bahrein and the Trncial Chiefs in Persia. It was, therefore, necessary for the British Govern ment to assert itself, and Major Cox urged that the Persian Government should be informed, if possible, that as their local officials no longer had the good sense to admit reasonable and informal intervention as heretofore, it was obligatory to intimate that there would, in future, be the same intervention on behalf of Bahreinis and subjects of Trucial Chiefs as in the case of British Indians, and that the necessary steps would be taken to make such intervention good.3\ 70. The Secretary of State was ac quainted by telegraph on the 5th April of the Tiews of the Political Resident, and on the 10th of the same month the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs telegraphed to the Chargd d’Affaires, Tehran, that there was no objection to the local action which the Political Resident proposed, but that the terms in which the demand to be made locally was to be commu nicated to the Persian Government required careful consideration; and he asked to be informed what action Mr. Marling would recom mend in order to enforce British rights, should redress be refused. In reply, His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires telegraphed that the Persian Government had informed him that instructions had been sent to Lingah to make reparation, but that it was claimed that the proprietary right of Persia over the island was not a matter to be disputed. Mr. Marling suggested the occupation, if necessary, of an island in the Gulf, preferably Kais or Hormuz, to enforce the recognition of our Protectorate. In a later telegram of the same date to the Foreign Office he reported that he had strongly urged on the Persian Government the necessity for compliance, suggesting that a note be written to him by the Foreign Minister to the effect that the desired instructions bad been communicated to the local authorities in the Persian Gulf, no mention being made of Persian claims. The Foreign Minister, it was thought, understood that Persia had no real claim to Bahrein, but both he and his coUeagues were in fear of the Assembly. His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires suggested that, if he were authorised to make of occupying an island, it would inspire them with the requisite a threat probably courage. 71.

On katip tbe . 6th A P ril 1908 » insult offered to Major Cox telegraphed that he bad received from His Majesty’s Consulate, Basrah, a letter from the Vali to the Kaimakam of Katif, giving him instructions in suitable terms. The letter was intended for use by the ship detailed to visit the port in order to receive the apology. Major Cox was of opinion that as the only two ships then present in the Persian Gulf, namelv, M Highflyer ” and “ Proserpine ”, were required for the Mekran coast, it would be preferable to let the matter await the return of “ Lapwing ** or at least the conclusion of the arms traffic season. On the 11th April, the Political Resident was informed by telegraph that His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, was about to make a tour in the Persian Gulf, and Major Cox waa instructed to consult him as to the ship to which the Kaimakam should tender the apology.6 ' 72. {Vide f&gt;ata. koweit. Agreement for lease of Bunder Shweikh foreshore. 195, October 1907) On the 4th March, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India telegraphed his appro val of the terms of the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, and expressed tie satis faction of His Majesty’s Government at the successful conclusion of the negotiations. 73. On the 14th April, the Political sirri Besident at Bushire Concession for the telegraphed to the ox traction of red oxide Legation at Tehran on the i.l.nd of —. ^ Mirza Ali Asghar, son of Haji Ali Akbar of Manchester, had been instructed to endeavour to obtain from the Persian Government, in his personal capacity as a Persian subject, a concession for the extraction of red oxide on the island of Sirri. It was presumed that it would benefit British interests, if it was intended that the concession, although obtained by a Persian Subject, would be exploited by the British firm of Haji Ali Akbar and Sons, Limited, of Manchester. The grant of such a concession would, however, affect the question of the status of the island, sovereignty over which had not definitely been conceded to Persia by His Majesty’s Government. Major Cox suggested that, if it were decided not to intervene at Tehran and to let the applicant for the concession take his chance, it would be prudent forth with to obtain a specific guarantee from the Manchester firm, that the concession would be controlled by them as a British Company in British interests, and would not he shared by, nor transferred to, any foreigner. 74. A report, dated the 10th March 1908, has been received Visit paid to Moham- merah by the Turkish gunboat “ Kileed-el- Bahar.” from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul ^ at Mohammerah to ' the effect that, on the afternoon of the 7th March, the Turkish Corvette “ Kileed-i- Bahar ’* from Basra anchored off Failia and fired a salute of 21 guns which was returned. ( The Officer Commanding called on the Sardar Arfa, and, on the latter’s expressing surprise at the visit, said that, if there were any objection, he would leave. The Sardar assured him that he had no objection, but that it had been unusual for the vessel to call. The Turkish Commander replied that he was taking a trip for change of air and bad taken the opportunity to call and salute the p&gt;rt; he further asked for permission to send a boat to the bazaar for provisions, to which the Sardar consented, pro vided the boat sent was unarmed. The vessel next morning anchored off the mouth of the Karun, and in the afternoon proceeded down the Shat-el-Arab to the Turkish guard station31 - 7 at Sihan, and on the 9th passed up towards Basrah. Both the Karguzar and the Sardar Arfa called on the Consul with regard to the visit, and suggested that it might have heen due to the fact that some 600 Arabs had come up the river from Gusba on the f th to work on the new canals, to the presence of the French gunboat '* Surprise ”, or to a desire to establish a precedent. 75. {Vide para. 207, Novemhrr 1207.) On the 11th November Quarantine arranpe- 1907, the Government gents in the Persian India telegraphed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, authorising him to take necessary action towards the purchase of the sanitary* apparatus required for the improved svstem of quarantine in the Gulf, and approv ing the deputation of Captain Williams, Chief Quarantine Officer, to Bombay frr this purpose, subject to the sanction of the Sanitary Council to his absence. Mr. Marling, in a telegram of the 18th November 1907 to the Foreign Office, reported that the decision of flis Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India was much appreciated by the President of the Sanitary Council; but that the latter strongly recommended the purchase of a portable stove to accompany the Mobile Assistant. The journey of Captain Williams to Bombay was sanctioned by the Sanitary Council, provided that during his absence arrangements were made for carrying out his duties, and it was suggested that the telegraph doctor should act during this period. On the 26th November 1907, the Political Resident telegraphed that Captain Williams supported the recommendation for the pur chase of a portable stove, and on the Ibth December this was sanctioned by the Govern ment of India. As regards his journey to Bombay, Captain Williams thought that it would be preferable to await the arrival of the Mobile Assistant. The Political Agent at Bahrein and Captain Williams were of opinion that another Assistant Surgeon was unnecessary for that place, the present incum bent being sufficiently well qualified to super vise stove work and quarantine arrangements. The Assistant Surgeon designated for Bahrein might, it was suggested, be employed at Bushire. It was further suggested that Bunder Abbas would be the most central spot for the eventual head-quarters of the Mobile Assistant. On being relieved by Captain White, the rewlv-appointed Mobile Assistant, on the 4tth March, Captain W illiams left for Bombay.PERSIAN GULF. 8G. The Secretary of State for India Movements of the intimated on the 14th of Zanzibar had expressed a wish to visit the Sultan of Maskat in July; but later it was intimated that the Sultan had apparently abandoned his intention and proposed to visit Europe direct. 87. On the 29th March, the Political maskat. Resident in the Persian Silver currency at Gulf submitted, for the consideration of the Government of India, a proposal that Government should purchase Maria Theresa dollars current at Maskat at the rate of about Rs. 150 per hundred. In 1903 when the Government of India had under consideration a similar proposal, it was agreed that the introduction of an Indian rupee currency in the territories of the Sultan might stimulate trade with India, and be advantageous from a political point of view. Rs. 132 per 100 dollars was then fixed as the limit at which the Government of India were prepared to purchase 4,00,000 dollar. The proposal to raise the rate to Rs. 150 has not been approved by the Government of India, as it practically involves the purchase of silver bullion at a price largely in excess of its market value. 88. On the 30th May, the Political Agent Arms traffic at Maskat. at M /? skat re P? rted tkat four dhows containing one hundred men had arrived at Maskat from the Somali coast, and that it was said that one had left for Debai. The French Consul and the Sultan of Maskat warned their respective subjects not to supply arms to these men, who, it was presumed, would not return to Somaliland till after the monsoon. 89. In regard to the first and third points Aba Musa red oxide raised by Major Cox concession. j n connection with the Abu Musa red oxide concession (vide para, graph 66 of the Memorandum for April) the Secretary of State telegraphed on the 1st May that Esa and Nejef might be informed that their proper course was to bring the suit in the Consular Court, and that they might be assured that the necessary steps would be taken by the Court to enforce payment of any sum that might be proved to be due to them. Major Cox, it was added, should not, at present, go so far as to say that payment would be made by the Government in the event of its proving impossible to enforce judgment against the defendants. If the suit was brought, there would be no objection to steps being taken to secure Hassan’s Sultan of Zanzibar, May that the Sultan on the previous day2 account books as exhibits in the case, provided that the correct legal procedure was very scrupulously observed. With reference to the second point, the Secretary of State explained that the object to be aimed at was that, without prejudice to and pending a settlement, which would necessarily take time, some temporary arrangement should be made to supply Messrs. Wdnekhaus &amp; Co. every month with a limited amount of oxide to enable them to fulfil their contracts. So long as the stuff already excavated sufficed for purpose of continuous supply, it would not be necessary to undertake further mining operations, but preparations to resume mining were to be undertaken in good time to prevent any interruption of the supply. The Govern ment of India were asked to telegraph their proposals for these temporary arrangements as soon as possible. The Political Resident, who was consulted, replied on the 9th May that it was clear that the accounts and operations would be compli cated by the introduction of another agent for transporting minerals accumulated near the mines, owing to the fact that the price per ton paid by the German firm included delivery on board, and as the transport and loading gear was in the possession of Hassan. Major Cox had visited Lingahand proposed to Hassan that he should proceed with the transportation of the accumulated minerals from inland to the beach after giving to the Resident a suitable undertaking as before. Hassan replied, after consulting Mr. Brown, that owing to the ex cessive heat and drought no serious transport ing operations would be possible for the next three or four months, and that work had always been suspended during the summer in the past; he stated further that, whereas he had always hitherto received from the firm three or four months previous warning of their wdsh to send a ship, Mr. Brown had intimated that he was unaware that his principals had any intention of taking more minerals in the near future. Major Cox was therefore of opinion that local circumstances appeared hardly to fit in with the Secretary of State’s directions that a limited quantity should be made available each month, and he suggested, for consideration, that an explan ation of the above facts should be given to the German Government, and that they should be informed that, according to Hassan’s estimate, about 400 tons remained on the beach and about 3,000 tons ot saleable quality near the mines. They might, it was suggested, be asked to ascertain approximately in how many instalments the German firm would wish to ship this quantity, the probable date contenn- plated for the arrival of the next ship, and the amount which w T ould be required by her.90. {Vide para. 68, April 1908.) On the 30th April 1908, the Political Resident Lingah had recently taken off from the mail steamer five subjects of Shargah, and had im prisoned them without reference to the Residency Agent. He stated that the desir ability of dealing simultaneously with the question of the protection of Bahreinis and with that of the protection of the subjects of the Trucial Chiefs was thereby accentuated. On the 1st May 1908, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Boreign Affairs te'e- graphed that the act of reparation and justice to the injured Bahreini appeared to constitute in itself a recognition of the right of His Majesty’s Government to protect subjects of Bahrein, and that, if the claim of the Persian Government was not reiterated, there was no need to effect or to threaten the occupation of an island in the Persian Gulf in order to enforce the claim. Mr. Marling on the 2nd May 1908 telegraphed that he had informed the Foreign Office that no amended note had been given to him and that, although he had succeeded in the Lingah case in obtaining substantial justice, the general question of protection of Bahreinis remained practically unaltered. He further stated that he entirely concurred in the view of Major Cox, and that, if the Persian Government continued obstinate, he would strongly urge that coercive steps should be taken. On the 18th May the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf telegraphed that the Foreign Office had directed His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran to press the Persian Government to send an amended note without delay, but had intimated that the general question for the present should not be raised unless the note contained any expression which could be construed as disputing British rights and unless further oases arose. As regards the protection of subjects of Trucial Chiefs, the assurances given to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire appeared to the Foreign Office sufficient, if carried out, to satisfy the needs of the case in question. The Poli tical Resident, in another telegram of the same date, explained to Mr. Marling that the Governor had given no assurances in regard to the actual case of the Bahreini, but had several times stated that he had instructions to treat Bahrein as Persian territory. The Deputy Governor of Lingah had, however, been suspended in connection with this and other cases. It was further explained that one of the Lingah factions, aided by Mr. Brown and by the Russian Consular Agent, were trying to get him reinstated. As no compensation The flogging of a Bahreini subject by the Deputy Governor of Dingah. BAHREIN. in the Persian Gulf telegraphed to Mr. Marling that the Deputy Governor of4 Lad been paid, Major Cox was endeayoTlring , to induce the Goyernor to recover it for the Bahrein!; it was feared, however, that adequate h eal redress could not be obtained. 91. In February last, the Sheikh of sheikh of Koweit’s Koweit complained to property at Fao. ]yj[ a j or Knox, the Poli tical Agent at that place, of the wanton destruction of his property at Pao by Turkish soldiers. It appears that-the latter * breached certain embankments which protected the Sbeikh’s property with tbe result that the water flooded and destroyed a number of his date trees. The reasons given by tbe Turkish authorities were that, for the safety of the fort, a clear space of 600 metres w r as required, that the Sbeikh had enclosed newly reclaimed land without paying the usual taxes, and that he had not obtained the necessary permission from Government. The Sheikh, on the other hand, contended that the limits of the fort had been laid down long ago in WTiting, which he possessed, that he had no knowledge why the limits had been enlarged, and that he had been given no opportunity of represent ing his views as proprietor. He further declared that he and the fort military author ities had built the bunds together eleven years ago, and that they had merely been repaired. Prom reports received by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in March, it was believed that the parties had come to an un derstanding. When visiting the Sbeikh about the beginning of April, however, the Political Resident found him much aggrieved at the action of the Turks in the matter. The Sheikh begged that pressure might be put upon the Turkish Government to agree to tbe formation of a Committee, consisting of His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah or the Political Agent at Kow r eit on behalf of the British Government, a representative of the Vali, and a represent ative of the Sheikh of Koweit, which should meet at Fao and examine the position locally by the light of the Sheikh’s documents. The Political Resident considered the Sheikh’s request reasonable and hoped that it would be possible to recommend tbe course proposed to His Majesty’s Government. On the 23rd April, the Government of India, in reporting the matter to His Majesty’s Government, pointed out that, in February 1899, the Secretary of State, in approving the ratification of an agreement with tbe Sheikh of Koweit, had authorised a hope being held out to the Sheikh that Govern ment would do what they could to protect him in the matter of his Fao estate. In view of this assurance tbe Government of India supported Major Cox’s recommendation.■r « 35 4 5 92. {Vide para. 73 of the Memorandum Sirri island red oxide for April.) On the concession. 13th May, the Secretary of State telegraphed that the question had been raised whether His Majesty’s Govern ment should permit the assertion by the Persian Government of any pretension to grant a concession in Sirri to pass without a protest, in view of the state of the controversy as to sovereignty over the island. The Government of India replied on the 22nd May that tliey did not recommend that any protest should be entered against the grant of the proposed concession, provided that the Manchester firm gave a guarantee in the terms suggested by Major Cox, but that it would be desirable to put in a formal reserv ation of the Jowasmi claim in view of future possible eventualities. 93. In December 1907, the Political Native dhows at Resident in the Persian liingah flying the Gulf reported that three German flag. native dhows, which had their bead-quarters at Lingah, were sail ing under the German flag. They were owned by a native of Kangoon on the Persian coast, who was now residing at Lingah and was engaged on behalf of the German firm of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., in the mother-of- pearl trade. This firm had financed him and held mortgages on two of his boats. He possessed informal certificates, signed on behalf of Messrs. Wonckhaus by Mr. Brown, which stated that the boats belonged to the German firm and that they were therefore allowed to sail under the German flag. As the use of tlie flag seemed to contravene the rules laid down in Articles XXX to XLI of the General Act of Brussels, Major Cox enquired whether any special action was intended, either through the Persian authorities or direct, in the way of challenging the right of these vessels to fly the flag. He suggested that, if a communication to the German Gov ernment was contemplated, it would be advis able, in the first instance, that he should endeavour to ascertain for certain that no unauthorised British flags were being flown by native craft in those waters. He was instructed to make the necessary enquiries, and the matter was reported to the Secretary of State. In March, the Secretary of State directed that no complaint in the matter should at present be made locally. On the 30th April, he telegraphed that, if enquiry at the Inter national Bureau at Brussels showed that papers had not been deposited there in accordance with Article XLI of the General Act, His Majesty’s Government were prepared to bring the matter to the notice of the German Government. He added that no6 action would be practicable unless Major Cox could certify that no unauthorised British flag was being used in those waters. On the 9th May, Major Cox reported that enquiries, which had been made, furnislied no grounds for supposing that non-British vessels were flying the British flag. It appeared, however, that strict adherence was not always given to the rules laid down in the Act for the acquisition and renewal of certi ficates, and the attention of British subjects was being drawn to the rule on the subject. Major Cox accordingly recommended that further steps should be postponed for a few weeks; and the Secretary of State agreed to this proposal. 94. (Vide para, 75, Aptil 1908.) Quarantine arrange- -^ n a tt*- 0 xneuts in the Persian 3rd April 1998, HlS Qulf * Majesty’s Secretary of State brought to the notice of the Govern ment of India a report, contained in the Proc&amp;s-verbal of the sitting of the Sanitary Council on 3rd February, respecting the action of the Captain of the R. I. M. S. “ Lawrence ,, who, on his way from Basrah to Karachi, called at Bushire and came ashore to interview the Resident without waiting for the quarantine visit. A report was called for, and it was requested that steps should be taken to enjoin upon vessels of the Royal Indian Marine the necessity of complying scrupu lously with the quarantine regulations in the Persian Gulf. On the 19th April 1908, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf submitted a report on the incident. It was stated that the Commander had expressed his regret for the infringement of the regulations and had been given strict instructions on the subject in order to prevent a similar incident in future. The Director of the Royal Indian Marine was also requested to issue instruc tions on the lines indicated by the Secretary of State to whom the facts were reported by the Government of India in a despatch, dated the 28th May. 95. In a letter to Sir E. Grey, dated the The mother-of-pearl 30th September 1907* end shell industry in Sir N. O Conor trans- the Persian Gulf. mitted a memorandum by Mr. George Lloyd, Honorary Attache to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople, dealing with the activity of a German firm in the mother-of-pearl and oyster shell trade in the Persian Gulf and containing observations there on. As an immediate measure Sir N. O’Conor suggested that the attention of the British India Steam Navigation Company, who did some work in the shell fishing industry at Bahrein, should be drawn to the question, and that they should be urged to make arrange ments for the extension of this branch of trade■r 3t 7 in the forthcoming season. On the 14th November 1907, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India telegraphed asking whether any action was proposed with a view to exert ing pressure on the local Sheikhs, a measure which had been suggested in Mr. Lloyd’s memorandum, and further requested the views of the Government of India on the subject. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, whose opinion was invited, stated that sufficient credit was not allowed to the important connection which Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. had always had with this trade. They were the first European firm to take it up, long before Mr. Wonckhaus came to the Gulf, and had not in any way reduced their operations. It was true that Mr. Wonckhaus, who migrated from East Africa to Lingah in 1898 or 1899, was enabled by the absence of close competition there to build up the small but prosperous business in shell export, which enabled him four years later to extend his operations to Bahrein and enter into competi tion with Messrs. Gray Paul on their own ground. The latter firm, however, had not slackened their energies and expressed the utmost confidence in their ability to hold their own in Bahrein. In regard to Lingah, there was a much less satisfactory story to tell. Here Mr. Wonckhaus had it all his own way from the beginning. Messrs. Gray Paul’s reason for refraining at the start from competing with him at that port was that they calculated that they could not run a satisfactory agency there with a native representative, and that the trade to be done there, whether in shells or other commodities, was not sufficient to warrant the expense of deputing a European. The urgency of better representation had been hitherto pressed upon them repeatedly without avail, but they intended immediately to send one of their superior staff there as an experimental measure who would also have the Trucial Coast within his heat. As regards the obstructive or constructive means to be employed for developing the trade, Major Cox was of opinion that, beyond doubt, if the demand could be created, the export of shells was capable of great expansion; but past experience of the demand, which had fluctuated considerably, seemed to indicate that it was not likely to develop much greater proportions unless the Australian trade failed. The object was therefore not so much to increase British operations by opening new channels, as to wrest some of the present volume of trade from German hands. As an obstructive measure, Mr. Lloyd had suggested that influence be exerted upon the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast calculated to8 throw the trade into British hands. Major Cox stated that he had not neglected this course, and a warning in this sense had been given to them some time ago. As soon as the Abu Musa question had ceased to be acute, lie intended to do what more was possible in the matter, but lie was not sanguine of a speedy result, the Sheikhs being very back ward, thick-witted and unbusinesslike. Major Cox was of opinion that anything in the shape of a grant to a British merchant or merchants of a monopoly of purchase, would be unworkable, either on shore or at the pearl banks, but that it seemed a feasible course that the Trucial Chiefs should severally arrogate to themselves the exclusive right of purchasing shells from their own subjects and should then be influenced to sell only to approved persons. Major Cox promised to take an early opportunity of sounding the Sheikhs on the subject generally, and to submit a further report. In the direction of constructive measures the following were suggested for consider ation :— (t) To press the British India Steam Navigation Company to give British shippers of shells to Bombay and Hamburg by their steamers liberal preferential rates. (n) For Government to grant a rebate to British firms of 2s, 6d. per ton of shells shipped to Europe or of such a less sum as would enable them to compete with Messrs. Wonckhaus, on equal or slightly better terms, either at Bahrein or Lingah. (tit) The transfer of purchase from the shore to the pearl banks and the lightering of shells from the boats at the banks, either by dhow or steam lighter. (it?) The import to Bahrein and else where, if necessary, of some simple machinery for cutting the pearl shells into discs, in order to save space and freight. (r) To endeavour to promote a pearl button factory in England in order to attract the trade to London. At present the manu factory of buttons seemed to be confined to Germany and Austria. («*) The institution of a small free British port at Bassidu or better still at Abu Musa, if it could be bought from the Sheikh of Shargah.Messrs. Gray Paul’s late Agent at Bahrein, who was shortly coming out from home after a year’s leave, had spent some time in Hamburg studying the shell question, and Major Cox had suggested that, on his return about a month hence, the Agents at Bushire, Bahrein, and the member of the firm above mentioned should meet in consultation, and try and work out a plan of campaign. 7u&gt;/PERSIAN GULF. 106.

On the 2nd June, the Secretary of State intimated that the proclamation which the Consuls at Maskat proposed to circulate in Oman had received the approval of the French Government who suggested early publication. The Political Agent at Maskat was instructed accordingly, but on account of the sudden death of the French Consul, it was considered desirable by the Government of India to postpone action. 110. On the 9th June 1898, Major Cox Interference of Foreign telegraphed that he was Powers in quarantine informed On the best arrangements in the authority that the German Consul had submitted a long report to his Legation on Gulf quarantine service, in which he advocated, in general accordance with Dr. Faivre’s views, the formation of an international sanitary station at Hormuz.2 111. On the 2nd June 1908, Major Cox Indebtedness of the that the head Sheikh of the Albu head Sheikh of the Albu Residents 8 ©? Bahrein.^ . Kowara tribes inhabiting Fuwaira in Aatr, who had become indebted to certain Bahrein merchants to the extent of two lakhs of rupees in connection with pearling operas tions, and was staying on parole in Bahrein pending a compromise with his creditors, had absconded with a large quantity of unsold pearls which he was to have left in Bahrein as security and had taken asylum in Katr. Owing to the possibility of an appeal to the Turkish authorities, it was . found difficult to deal with him or his village effectively, and as all friendly means of inducing him to return and meet his creditors had failed, Major Cox pro posed that one of His Majesty’s ships should arrest some of the boats of the tribe when on the pearl bank at sea and take them to Bahrein for detention in order to bring the debtor to terms. He added that, if the Sheikh were allowed to evade justice with impunity, others would follow suit. On the 15th June 1908, Major Cox was requested by telegram to report whether Sheikh of Bahrein had moved in the matter. It was added that it seemed doubtful whether action should be taken by the British authorities to recover private debts. 112. (Vide para. 71 of Memorandum for Offered to the 190 ^) On the 14th June 1908, Captain Trevor, the . . _ . -First Assistant Resident m the Persian Gulf, forwarded a telegram which had been received from the Commander ^ H \ M * S \“ La P w ing ” at Fao reporting that the Kaimmakam of Katif came on board at Katif and presented an apology in writing and that he also apologised verballv The Commander returned the visit the nevt day, when he found all the officials very friendly and was offered every hospitality. 113.

On Quarantine arrange* the 27th April 1908, gents in the Persian .Major Cox, the Political ‘ Resident in the Persian Gulf, telegraphed that Captain Williams found that the Clayton apparatus could be worked only in calm water and consequently would be useless at any Persian port except Moham- merah. The proximity of the latter port to Basra which was in itself a large lazaretto appeared to render the provision of the apparatus there unnecessary. Captain M ilhams therefore suggested placing the appar atus at Maskat where infected ships could be dealt with before they entered the Gulf. In view, however, of the possibility of the Foreign Powers using this suggestion as an argument Insult Commander of H.M.S. “ Lapwing ” by Turkish officials at Katif.in favour of a sentinel station at the mouth of the Gulf, Major Cox requested the views of the Government of India on the point before he made any proposal to the Sanitary Council regarding Maskat. On the 11th June 1908, the views of His Majesty’s Secretary of State were asked on the proposal. The Government of India were of opinion that it was not desirable to take the apparatus outside the Gulf and that Mohammerah seemed preferable to Maskat. On the 22nd June 1908, Mr. Marling, His Majesty’s Charg6 d’Affaires, Tehran, repeated a telegram sent by him to the Foreign Office, in which he expressed the opinion that the Sanitary Council could be brought to agree to the Clayton apparatus being stationed at Mohammerah if the unsuitableness of the other Persian ports were explained to them, but that as the Council had always expected the apparatus to be placed at Bushire a proposal to that effect would be likely to involve discussion of the question of a sentinel station. If it was desirable to avoid this Mr. Marling advocated that it would be advis able to place the apparatus at Bushire for the present, as it might be difficult to control the course of discussion owing to the absence of the French President of the Council and the other French Members.PERSIAN GULF. 127.

This large increase was, however, mainly due to the unprecedented traffic in arms and ammunition, the value of which exceeded that of the year preceding by Rs. 22,00.685. There were also abnormal specie remittances connected with this trade. If the arms trade be excluded, the value of the general trade of the country showed a decline of 15 ^. 128.

On the 28th June 1908, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf informed Major Prideaux that there was no objection to the proposed grant on the terms mentioned. 130. On the 15th March 1908, Major , . Cox, the Political sion to sheikh All-bin- Resident in the Persian Ahmed-el-Khalifa to Gulf, forw’arded a corn- return to Bahrein. • x* r mumcation from the Political Agent, Bahrein, in which it was re-C4T 2 commended on the application of the Sheikh of Bahrein that Sheikh Ali-bin-Ahmed-el- Khalifa might be permitted to return from exile and intimated the conditions on which Sheikh Ali had bound himself to be of good behaviour. Major Cox supported the proposal, but was of opinion that to prevent difficulties arising in the future, it was desirable to procure further information and possibly to demand further conditions in regard to the property which Sheikh Ali possessed or claimed in Manama. On the 28th May 1908, Major Cox telegraphed that the Sheikh of Bahrein, after consulting the Political Agent, proposed to make the following definite provision for his nephew : — (1) The life enjoyment of three date gardens outside Manama producing altogether about 8,200 rupees per annum. (2) A cash payment of one thousand rupees per annum in lieu of the enjoyment of shops in Manama which were to be relin quished by Sheikh Ali. (3) A monthly cash allowance of two hundred rupees. As the Sheikh of Bahrein intimated that he was willing to pay the two money allow ances through the Political Agent, Major Cox recommended that this course should be adopted in order to ensure regular payment and to have some hold over Sheikh Ali. Major Cox requested that, if the above terms were accepted by Government, the Political Agent, Bahrein, should be authorised to address a letter to the Sheikh of Bahrein informing him of the orders of Government. The latter would then communicate the news to his nephew at Bombay. It was further suggested that the Government of Bombay should be requested to await a communication from the Political Agent, and that then Sheikh Ali should be permitted to leave for Bahrein after settling up his accounts with the Commissioner of Police. On the 1st July 1908, Major Cox was informed that, in view of the satisfactory arrangements made for ensuring Sheikh Alps future good behaviour, his recommendations were accepted, and he was authorised to inform the Sheikh of Bahrein accordingly. The arrangements which he proposed for the com munication of the decision of Government to Sheikh Ali and the subsidiary measures to be taken in conjunction with the Government of Bombay for his return, were approved. 131. Writing on the 4th June 1908, Major Employment on qua- Cox, the Political Besi- ranune duties of the Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Telegraph Station at Bushire. dent in the Persian Gulf, suggested that the Assistant Surgeon on the Telegraph establishment at Reshire might3 be reckoned as the third Quarantine Assistant at Bushire. He explained that at present as a matter of courtesy and to oblige the Besidency Surgeon the Assistant Superintendent of Tele graphs had consented to the Assistant Surgeon carrying out the inspection of H. M.’s ships which anchor at Reshire, but, as it was desirable to regularise this arrangement, he recom mended that— {a) during times of epidemic the services of the Assistant Surgeon at Reshire might be made available for quarantine duties at the discretion of the Resident in communi cation with the Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs, and that when so employed he should receive the same remuneration as the other Assistant Surgeons, viz., grade pay and an allowance of Rs. 150 a month; and (b) that at ordinary times he should be responsible to the Chief Quarantine Officer for the inspec tion of all ships anchoring at Reshire. For these duties, which would be light, an allow ance of Rs. 15 a month was suggested. The Diiector of the Persian Gulf Section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who was consulted in the matter, stated that he saw no objection to Major Cox’s proposals. 132. {Vide para. 93, May 1908.) On Native dhows at the 7th June, the Poli- Lingah flying the Ger- tical Resident in the man flag. Persian Gulf brought to notice a few cases in which British subjects were flying the British flag without having first obtained certificates or having failed to renew them regularly. Major Cox stated that these particular cases were being looked into, and that he had directed the out-agencies to take steps to remind British subjects within their jurisdiction of the necessity of close adherence to the rules regulating the use of the flag. He had also asked the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, to arrange for the subsidised ships, when cruising in those waters, to take opportunities of examining the papers of any native craft met with under the British flag, which were clearly not Indian, and to see that they were in order. Major Cox left it to Government to decide whether action should be taken at an early date in the matter of the German flag, or whether it would be better to wait for a time before taking that step. Major Cox’s letter was forwarded to the India Office by weekly letter, and the Secretary of State was informed that, in the circumstances explained, the Govern ment of India were of opinion that it would be better to defer the proposed representation to the German Government for the present.* PERSIAN GTJLE. 149. (Vide para. 88 of the Memorandum for May.) On the 4th Arms Traffic at Maskat. Augu ' st) i n fo rma tion was received that 400 rifles destined for Koweit had been seized by H.M.S, “ Sphinx in the course of the search for arms of two British India mail steamers in Maskat Harbour. Major Cox was of opinion that this course of action, though it might have a salutary effect on the British India Steam Navigation Co., would, if persevered in, in all probability ha^e a prejudicial effect on the amenableness of the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sultan of Maskat, the preservation of which might be of great importance to Government should they require one or both rulers to fall in with any change of policy in regard to Koweit or Maskat consequent on the conclusion of the Brussels Conference. As no practical harm would result from temporary inactivity since the traffic to Koweit, unlike the Mekran traffic, did not immediately affect British interests, Major Cox asked the Senior Naval Officer to suspend activity pending the intimation of the wishes of the Government of India. The Government of India approved of the Residents action. 150.

(Vide para. 90, May 1908.) Writing on the 3rd ject h o? 0 t g h g e n |heikh SU of April 1908, respecting Bahrein by ti e Deputy British intervention on Governor of Lingah. 1|dial f of the Sheikhs of Trucial Oman, Mr. Marling, His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, stated that our right to insist on the Persian Gov ernment accepting such intervention is unassailable in view of our published treaties of 1892. It seemed likely that His Majesty’s Government would insist on final recog nition by the Persian Government of our rights respecting Bahrein and Bahreinis also. On the 22nd May 1908, His Majesty’s Secre tary of State telegraphed that Mr. Marling was instructed on the 16th May by telegram to press for amended note from Persian Govern ment and was informed that Government was reluctant to raise the general question at2 present unless the note disputed our right and further cases arose. As regards the subjects of the Sheikh of Shargah he was also informed that the assurances given by the Governor of Bushire appeared, if carried out, sufficient to meet tbe particular case. On the 29th May 1908, Major Cox repeated a telegram Bent to His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, on the 20th May. He stated that he had discussed the case respecting the Bahreini and Sbargah subjects with the Darya Begi since his return from tour. The Darya Begi had now put in writing with regard to the latter case that his Deputy acted without his knowledge, and that for this and other disputes with the Britisli Agent he had deposed him and promised not to re-employ him during his Governorship. Regarding the Bahreini case the Governor wrote unofficially that the deposed Deputy stated on oath that he only took twenty-five pounds and a few rupees from the Bahreini. The Governor undertook to refund this amount and also any further amount which the Shaa Court at Lingah might hold proved after further enquiry. Major Cox Was doubtful of success, but would attempt to get some compensation. In view of the action taken in the Shargah case and of the desire of His Majesty’s Government to postpone raising any general question, it was proposed that the settlement proposed by the Governor might be considered as satisfactorily closing the case. In a letter of the 24th April 1908, to His Majesty’s Government, Mr. Marling stated that, in accordance with the instructions received by him, he addressed a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, in presenting it to His Excellency, said that he hoped that the Persian Government would view the matter in a reasonable light and refrain from again putting forward claims to the sovereignty of Bahrein based on no better grounds than the Treaty of 1822 which had not only never been ratified, but had also been repudiated by both the Persian and British Governments. Mushir-ed-Dowleh promised to give the ques tion his best attention and to do all he could to bring about a settlement. On the 9th April, however, in a note to Mr. Marling the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the Persian Government, out of its constant regard for the peace of its subjects, had sent strong orders to the local authorities to make repara tion and do the man justice if he had been ille gally treated and reaffirmed that Bahrein was a possession of Persia. On the 10th April, Mr, Marling had occasion to see the Mushir-ed- Dowleh and explained to him the disappoint ment felt at his written reply and warned him that His Majesty’s Government intended to have the question satisfactorily and definitely settled. It was pointed out to him that for morethan one hundred years the British Government had had treaty relations with Bahrein, and that for the same period of time Persia had never made the smallest effort to assert her pre tended rights, and that by our Treaty of 1880, the Chief of Bahrein had placed his foreign relations in our hands, and that finally within the last few years Persian subjects who bad got into trouble in the island had received protection from the British Government. He was asked to address another note stating merely that he had given the necessary orders to the local authorities in the Gulf and wher ever else Bahreinese were likely to be found that the representations of our Consular officers on behalf of Bahreinese were to be accepted without reserve. Another note was promised by Mushir-ed-Dowleh after consulting his colleagues, but he did not declare what the nature of it would be. As regards the mea sures to be taken to enforce compliance w 7 ith our wishes, IVlr. Marling suggested the occu pation of Hormuz or Kais primarily on the ground that it was in the interests of our prestige with the protected Chiefs in the Gulf that we were demanding the recognition of our right to protect Bahreinese from the Persian Government; he was convinced that a formal threat to employ force would induce the Persian Government to give way. In another letter of the 21st May, to Sir E. Grey, Mr. Marling reported that he had constantly urged the Minister for Foreign Affairs to send him an amended note, but that His Excellency pleaded for more time to examine the matter from the historical point of view, and in consequence of the recurrent ministerial crises he had not been able to prepare his case. Further it was admitted that the disinclination to comply with our demand arose from fear of what might be said of him in the Assembly. Mr. Marling was of opinion that the Minister would avoid giving a satisfactory answer unless some material pressure, or at least the threat of it, were employed. 153. On the 11th August 1908, the First ^ Assistant Besident, Buskire, telegraphed that Captain Prideaux, wffio had returned from a visit to Katif in the a Lapwing ,, , had reported that the Bedouins in the Katif oasis and neigh bourhood had rebelled and attacked the town of Katif and the Shiah towms and villages of the oasis. A large number of people had been massacred and most of the date trees destroyed. The garrison of Amich and the village of Saihat had been beleaguered for more than a fortnight, w 7 hile attacks were made on Katif every night, and the Turks were hard pressed, and unless re-inforcements were speedily sent he anticipated that the garrison4 m would have to abandon the town population to massacre. Captain Prideaux anticipated that the Kaimmakam would apply for the assistance of a British man-of-war, and enquired whether Government would approve of such assistance being rendered, and to what extent it should be given. He had received a memorial^ from the principal merchants of Bahrein pointing out that in consequence of the closing of trade relations with Katif, they were being subjected to heavy losses from the ruin of the Katifies and the destruction of the property in the oasis. The Government of India replied to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that it was out of the question to lend assistance unless it was formally asked for by the Turkish authorities and informed the Secretary of State of the action taken. The Political Resident in Turkish Arabia was also asked whether he could confirm the information regarding the attack on Katif. On the 15th August, the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia replied that nothing was known by the Baghdad publie about the affair at Katif and that the B ali was reticent and inclined to treat the matter as of no importance. Commander Pasha said, however, that the civil officer at Katif, who had a force of 70 men, had asked for food and reinforcements about the 2nd August; 200 soldiers were sent from Basrah in the Turkish gun-boat “ Kalid Bahr ” and in a few days a further detachment of 400 men with one gun would leave for Katif from Baghdad. On the same day the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed that the Consul was assured by the 'Wali of Basrah that a relief force of 150 men and two guns would leave on the 16th August for Katif. On the 18th August, the Political Resident, Bushire, telegraphed that the despatch of troops from Basrah had been post poned and that the Consul had telegraphed about the matter to the Embassy at Constanti nople. The Secretary of State telegraphed on the 19th August that without express sanction from His Majesty’s Government no assistance was to be given to the lurkish authorities. 154. (Vide para. 112 of Memoran* Lapwing” by Turkish Captain Trevor, the officials at k atif. Pirst Assistant Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, forw arded for the in formation of the Government of India a report from Lieutenant Gouldsmith, the Commander of H.M.S. “Lapwing” regarding his proceed ings at El Katif. On Eriday, the 5th June Insult ofiered to the Commander of H.M.S. dum for June 1908.) On the 2nd July 1908,wt A 5 1908, Lieutenant Gouldsmith arrived at El Katif and sent the Interpreter to Katif, with an open letter from the Yali of Basrah to the Kaimmakam of El Katif. The Kaimmakam sent by the Interpreter a written apology in Arabic and on the 6th June the Kaimmakam accompanied by the Captain of the Port and the Military Officer Commanding the Eorces round Katif called on Lieutenant Gouldsmith. The Kaimmakam seemed honestly to regret the behaviour of the former official. He insisted upon Lieutenant Gouldsmith return ing his call. On the following day, Lieutenant Gouldsmith called on the Kaimmakam at his house and he and his boat’s crew received every hospitality. Appointment of Captain M. F. White, as Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Officer in the Persian Gulf. 155. In accordance with the scheme for carrying out certain reforms in the arrange ments for quarantine in the Persian Gulf on the 7th November 1907, the Secretary of State sanctioned the appointment of an officer of the Indian Medical Service as a Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Officer in the Persian Gulf at a cost of £560 a year. On the 4th March 1908, Captain M. E. White, I.M.S., was posted for duty as Mobile Assistant. 156. (Videpara. 113, June 1908.) On Quarantine arrange- 1908, His ments in the Persian Majesty’s Secretary of GuLf ‘ State for India tele graphed that it appeared best in the circum stances that the Clayton apparatus should be placed at Bushire for the present. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was accordingly informed, and was requested to take the necessary action in the matter. 157. (Vide para. 95, May 1908.) On the The mother-of-pearl 7th June 1908, Major and shell industry in Cox, the Political Resi- the Persian Gulf. dent in the Gulf, submitted a further report on the subject of the trade in mother-of-pearl shells from the Persian Gulf. Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., the English firm most interested in this trade, informed Major Cox that they were anxious to develop their shell interests in the Gulf not only for their own sake, but also to limit the threatened expansion of the German trade. The firm was of opinion that they could not trade safely or profitably on the lines now followed by the German firm either in buying pearls from the dhows on the pearl banks or in giving large advances to native middle- no en to purchase shells for them. A new representative had been appointed by the firm at Lingah, who was expected to arrive at Behai shortly for the purpose of examining thisbranch of the trade on the spot and reporting to his principals on the possibilities of further successful enterprise. Major Cox himself talked over the problem with the Trucial Sheikhs individually, and reported that no system of monopoly appeared to be workable in practice owing to the difficulty of enforcing it. The position at present was that promiscuous Persian boats came over time to time from the Lingah coast and bought up any shells that were found accumulated. Although the pre sumption was that they were working for or in association with Messrs. Wonckhaus* Lingah Agent, yet there w r ere no outward indication that such was the case. The Sheikhs explained that it wmuld not be worth their while to handle the shells themselves except in pursuance of some specific arrangement with an English firm. They assured Major Cox that, if Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co.’s Agent at Debai or any one else representing a British firm was anxious to purchase shells and ready to pay as good a price as anyone else, they were prepared to ensure that they should have the first refusal. The circumstances of competition on the spot were outwardly fair, Wonckhaus having no local facilities for obtaining the shells w hich British firms had not; but the British firms averred that the Germans must be in receipt of strong Government support in the shape of rebates or subsidies sufficient to enable them to buy on terms on which Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. could not trade profitably. It w r as stated that the entry of another British firm, such as Messrs. Lynch, into the lists would not be welcome to Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., as the effect would be to increase the rate of purchase for everybody and in the absence of subsidies would not put the German firm in difficulties. It appeared that the only way this firm could be assisted was by a subsidy in one form or another, which would enable them to place one of their best English Agents at Lingah and to pay better prices than Messrs. 'Wonckhaus. Major Cox suggested that the Directors of the British India Steam 2* aviga- tion Company and Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. in London should be approached by His Majesty’s Government if anything in the direction of subsidies was considered feasible. A copy of the correspondence was forwarded to the India Office. On the 21st July 1908, the Secretary of State for India was informed by telegraph that the Government of India considered that the question of putting pressure on the Sheikhs as circum stances necessitated could be left to Major Cox’s discretion and they concurred in the view that direct interference to obtain a British monopoly was undesirable.7 * 158. {Vide para. 132, July 1908.) In a Native dhows at letter from the In . dia Lmgah flying the Office to the Poreign German flag. Office, dated the 22nd July, it was stated that the Secretary of State for India was of opinion that no action should be taken to challenge the right of the dhows to fly the German flag till the of India reported that the use of by native dhows had been flag in question Government the British regularised. 159. Writing on the 23rd April 1908 to Capture of certain Secretary of State pirates in the Persian for Poreign Affairs, Gulf ' Mr. Marling stated that experience in the East had taught him that when a Poreign Legation conveyed to the Government of the country its satisfaction at the conduct of any particular official, such action frequently brought the individual whom it meant to serve under suspicion of being too friendly with foreigners and might prove a disservice to him. Accordingly, on receiving instructions to convey the thanks of His Majesty’s Government to the Persian Government for the helpful conduct of the Khan of Bander Rig in the capture of the pirates of Dayyir, Mr. Marling telegraphed to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire enquiring his views on the matter. Major Cox replied that the Khan was not very desirous that a recommendation in his favour should be made to the Persian Government, but preferred to be allowed to hope that he could count on the good offices of the British Government in case he needed them in the future. Mr. Marling recommended that the matter should in the circumstances be dropped. Sir E. Grey on the 15th May 1908 proposed to the India Office that, in view of the facts mentioned by Mr. Marling, no further action should be taken in the matter, in which view Viscount Morley concurred. 160. On the 13th August 1908, the The lighting of the Government of India Persian Gulf. addressed the Secretary of State on the subject of the better lighting of the Persian Gulf, with a view not only to afford greater facilities for navigation, but also still further to establish the predomin ant position of the British Government in that quarter. It was stated that in 190-1, attention was called by the administration of Lord Curzon to the desirability of placing a light-house on some suitable site at the extremity of the Musandim Promontory, and that in September of the same year the services of an expert to be engaged through the Trinity House were asked for, to examine and report on the proposal as well as on the general question of lighting the Gulf. Sincem then the general question had continued to occupy the attention of the Government of India, and the matter was recently brought prominently to notice in connection with a proposed revision of the subsidy to be paid to the British India Steam Navigation Company for the fast weekly mail service to the Persian Gulf when Messrs*. Mackinnon Mackenzie, the Managing Agents of the Company, pointed out that one of the most serious difficulties in the way of accelerating and improving the mail service was the absence of lights which rendered navigation dangerous except by day light. As the matter was one of great importance it was proposed that the general question of the better lighting of the Gulf should be examined locally by an officer experienced in light-house construction in conjunction with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Senior Naval Officer on duty in the Gulf, and the Officer in Charge of the Marine Survey of India. In the event of the proposal meeting with the approval of His Majesty’s Govern ment it was requested as there was no officer available in India with the requisite experience that the services of an expert should be obtained through the Trinity House, 1PERSIAN GULF. 173. With a view to prevent the export , trade of arms to Somali- Arms trafflo at Maskat. i i i i , land, steps have been taken to station a gun-boat at Maskat during October. 174. {Vide para. 89, May 1908.) On “The Abu Musa Red. the 2nd June 1908, Oxide concession. the Secretary of State for India telegraphed that Major Cox should be instructed to request the local representative of Messrs. Wonckhaus to give due notice when the firm intended to resame operations with a view to the necessary arrangements being made for the temporary supply to them of oxide to enable them to fulfil contracts pending the final decision of the case. A statement of the instructions issued to Major Cox on the point would be added to the reply of His Majesty’s Government to the German case. These orders were communicated to Major Cox on the 4th June. On the 8th June, Major Cox reported that be had informed Hr. Listemann, the German Consul-General at Bushire, that the Sheikh of Shargah had been advised to allow any oxide already mined and accumu lated on the island to be removed by Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. He had also requested the German Consul to ask Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. to give due notice when the firm wished to ship again, so that the necessary arrange ments could be made. As regards the recom mencement of mining operations, Major Cox was of opinion that the existing heaps of red oxide could be marked wdth whitewash and photographed, if necessary, and that this having been done mining might be renewed as soon as the hot weather was over. The newly mined mineral could be heaped on another side of the mine and kept quite separate from the present heaps. The Sheikh of Shargah had already been approached by two or three native applicants for a contract, hut, without committing himself to anything specific, had authorised Major Cox to ascertain from Messrs. Strick, or other British firm, the terms on which the^r would he prepared to take charge of the mining and selling opera tions on his behalf. These terms should, Major2 Cox suggested, he ascertained by His Majesty’s Government in London, the simplest way being for the firm to take such a percentage on the sale price of the oxide delivered on board, as would cover their working expenses and give them a reasonable margin of profit. As regards the claims of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif and Nejef-bin-Ali against Hassan Samaiyeh, Major Cox’ primary object in advising that they should enter suits against Hassan was to obtain possession of Hassan’s account books before they were manipulated. Eut before the reply of Government on that point was received, Mr. Brown had returned to Lingah and commenced sedulously preparing the accounts. Esa-bimAbdul Latif, an un sophisticated person, was not capable of: going to Bushire and prosecuting the suit against Hassan who would be strongly supported and advised by Mr. Brown, and besides he was unable to afford to employ the expensive services of a Barrister from Bombay. As it would weaken our position to allow the parties to institute the suits and fail ignominiously, Major Cox was inclined to think that it would be wiser to defer suing Hassan until after the present dispute was disposed of. Esa and Nejef might ask Hassan in a friendly way to give them a statement of the accounts, and then if they were not satisfied with them they could move the Consulate again. On the 7th July, the Secretary of State for India enquired, at the instance of the Foreign Office, for the information of the German Embassy, whether the local representative of Messrs. Wonckhaus had already been informed by Major Cox that all oxide mined might be exported and whether the German Consul at Bushire had also been similarly informed. A reply in the affirmative was sent to the Secretary of State on the 13th July. On the 23rd July, the Secretary of State was informed by despatch that the Government of India proposed to inform Major Cox in reply to his letter of the 8th June, a copy of which was forwarded for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government— (i) that the arrangement which he sug gested for the renewal of mining operations after the hot weather was approved; (ii) that negotiations with Messrs. Strick or other firms for the undertaking of a contract for the management of the mining and sales on behalf of the Sheikh of Shargah must be postponed until the questions at issue between the British and German Governments had been settled; (iii) that in the circumstances now explained, it would be desirable to defer for3 the present the institution of suits by Esa-bin- Abdul Laiif and Nejet'-bin-Ali against Hassan Samaiyeh and that he might use his discretion as to advising Esa and Nejef to apply to Hassan for a statement of the accounts. On the 18th August, His Majesty’s Secre tary of State for India telegraphed that he understood from the Political Resident’s letter of the 8th June that he recommended the renewal of mining operations by the Agency of Stride &amp; Co or other British firm, and requested to be informed by what Agency it was contemplated that such renewal should take place in case Messrs. Strict or other firm were not employed. The Government of India, on the 21st August, enquired the views of Major Cox on the subject. On the 25th August, Major Cox telegraphed that the mining operations would consist of the employment of about twenty Persian diggers who must be recruited from Lingah or its neighbourhood. The Sheikh himself was hopelessly unbusi nesslike, and the only satisfactory arrange ment which could be proposed, pending the issue of a fresh concession was that, with the Sheikh’s concurrence, it might be arranged that one of his brothers sh mid take in hand the work of excavation, the working expenses being provided or guaranteed by Government who would be reimbursed when the mineral was sold. Until a new concession was granted, the transport of stuff to the sea coast would not be possible, as it would be necessary to purchase transport animals, &amp;c. On the 29th August, the above telegram from Major Cox was repeated to His Majesty’s Secretary of State, who was informed that the proposals in the despatch from the Government of India of the 23rd July contemplated that the German case would be settled in time to admit of arrangements being concluded with Strick or other British firm before the season for the mining operations arrived. The tem porary expedient suggested by Major Cox was somewhat unsatisfactory, and that unless the settlement of the German case was likely to be much longer delayed, the adoption of Major Cox’s proposals were not recommended. If there was now no objection, negotiations might be opened with a British firm as suggested in Major Cox’s letter of the 8th June. On the 22nd September, His Majesty’s S cretary of State telegraphed to the effect that His Majesty’s Government agreed with the Government of India that the proposal to employ the Sheikh’s brother was objectionable, but that it was impossible to approach a British firm with proposals for the permanent4 working of the oxide until the German question was settled. His Majesty’s Government con sidered that the best plan would he to get Messrs. Strick, if possible, or some other British firm to undertake on behalf of the Sheikh as a temporary arrangement the excavation and transport to the coast of the quantities of oxide required by Messrs. Wonckhaus. In view of the temporary nature of the arrange ment it was desirable that it should be made locally and not with Messrs. Strick in England. His Majesty’s Secretary of State enquired whether Major Cox could arrange this. The approval of His Majesty’s Government was also conveyed to the proposed postponement of the suits against Hasan. The Secretary of State’s telegram was repeated to Major Cox, on the *25th September, who replied on the 27th to the effect that he did not intend in his telegram of the 25th August to suggest the employment of the brother of the Sheikh of Shargah, but of the Residency Agent at Lin gab. He enquired whether he could arrange with the brother of the Residency Agent if the arrangement with the local Agent of Messrs. Strick proved impracti cable. Murder of certain subjects of the Chief of Abu Thabi by residents of Taona. 175. {Vide p ra.47, September 1906.) The efforts of the Poli tical Resident in the Persian Gulf to secure compensation from the Persian Government for the murder in 1902 of four subjects of the Chief of Abu Thabi by Persian subjects residing in Taona have hitherto proved unsuccessful. The Persian Government, while refusing to pay the blood- money demanded, assured His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, that the 'murderers had been apprehended. But, during the recent pearling season, the Political Resident in the Petsian Gulf received intelligence that two of the murderers, whom the Persian Government had officially announced to be dead, were alive and on the pearl banks. Major Cox accordingly on the 13th July reported the fact to His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, and asked for authority to instruct the Senior Naval Officer to detail one of the subsidised ships to effect their capture at sea, if possible. On the same date Mr. Marling in communicat ing the information to Sir E. Grey expressed his concurrence in the proposal to attempt the capture of the men, and enquired whether it would be possible, if sufficient evidence were forthcoming, to send them to India for trial. On the 1st August 1908, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India informed the Government of India by telegraph that they x 45 proposed to approve the suggested attempt to capture the murderers, hut that, as there were difficulties from the point of view of inter national law, in sending them to India for trial, the best course would be, owing to the improbability of obtaining punishment or compensation through a trial in the Persian Court, to send the men to Abu Thabi for trial and punishment, and to detain them there till the Chief of Taona paid compensation for the victims’ families. It was suggested in the had been obtained that they would be properly tried and punished on their return to Persian soil. The Government of India informed His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, on the 11th August, that they saw no objec tion to the issue of instructions to the above effect to Mr. Marling. Accordingly, on the 21st August, Mr. Marling was requested by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to instruct Major Cox, the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, to adopt which ever of the alternatives he thought preferable. On the 3rd September, however, Major Cox telegraphed that recent news received from the Residency Agent at Lingah, showed that, as the men had finished pearling operations and returned home, the time had passed for action at sea. He also reported that the third brother, who was until recently in prison at Shiraz, had returned to his country having gained his freedom. Major Cox promised to mate fresh proposals on the receipt of the text of the report of the Agent at Lingah. 176. {Vide para. 111, June 1908.) —Writ- steam launch to Fuwairat, Sheikh Nasir’s home, and to Lusail, to make an effort to induce the man to return to Bahrein under a safe conduct, provided that he brought back the pearls which lie had carried away in his flight. He accordingly interviewed Sheikh iNasir on the 22nd May at Lusail whither Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani had summoned him under a safe conduct from Doha. The man was obdurate in demanding that the mortgage creditors should restore all the deposits of pearls which they held as partial security for their claims in spite of the written authority which he had given them to se 1 in certain eventualities. Captain Prideaux was unable to prevail on him to trust himself before the Bahrein Majlis, though he had alternative that the men might be detained at Abu Thabi till a satisfactory undertaking ing on the 26th June proceeded in the Agency\ 6 no reason for fearing that they would not treat him justly. Captain Prideaux expressed the opinion that if we were unprepared to put the same pressure upon the people of Katar ns we did upon those of Bahrein through their ruler a grave situation would arise owing to the extremely intimate commercial relations which existed between the two countries. If any weakness in regard to Sheikh Nasir was shown, Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Jasim would naturally also ignore any representations and the commercial situation which was bad in Bahrein would be rendered infinitely worse. In view of the foregoing explanation Captain Prideaux stated that he would like to be authorised to proceed against the Albu-Kowara villages on shore, if necessary. If the Gov ernment were not prepared to run this risk, the temporary seizure of the tribe’s boats on the pearl hanks would have the effect of putting sufficient pressure to bear upon Nasir- bin-Shabin and the authority of Sheikh Esa and the Political Resident would be satisfac torily vindicated. In forwarding the correspondence for the orders of the Government of India, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf sug gested that it was advisable to decide whether we should interfere actively to settle such cases in future. On the 4th July, Captain Prideaux report ed that Sheikh Nasir had returned to Bahrein under the pressure put upon him by the headman of the other tribal villages, notably Saiyid Abdallah-bin-Shamsan of Ruwais and Sheikh Sultan-bin-Nasir as Suwaidi of Bida. The Political Agent was hopeful that an arrangement would be arrived at without the necessity of recourse to active measures. The return of the Sheikh to Bahrein was due to the general knowledge that his case was being considered by the Government of India and to the reports that it was intend ed to adopt forcible measures against the absconder and his tribe in the event of his continuing recalcitrant. Captain Prideaux hoped that the Government of India would accord their approval of the general principle regarding the desirability of active interference in° Katar affairs of this nature whenever necessity arose in future. On the 31st August, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was informed that the Government of India was glad to learn that there was good prospect of the case beino* settled without the adoption of coercive measures. In the circumstances it was con sidered preferable not to discuss the general question raised by Major Prideaux. The nrexpediency of active interference on the part of the Political Agent in Katar affairs depended on the circumstances of each case and on the political conditions existing at the time, and it was not considered desirable to lay down any general rule on the subject. 177. (Vide para. 91, May 1908.) On sheikh of Koweit’s 12th June, His properties at Fao. Majesty’s Secretary of State for India called for further information regarding the Sheikh’s complaint of Turkish encroachments on his properties at Pao and pointed out that, if representations at Con stantinople were to he more than a recom mendation to the Porte to instruct the local authorities to bring about an equitable settle ment by means of a Committee or otherwise, a detailed statement of the whole case would be necessary. Prom the report which was furnished by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the 10th August, on the subject, in accordance with the instructions of the Gov ernment of India, it appeared that there were two separate claims under dispute, one with the Turkish military authorities regarding that portion of the Sheikh’s property con tiguous to the periscope of the Pao fort and involving the right of riparian reclamation, the other concerning the ownership of a piece of valuable ground at the northern extremity of the Sheikh’s estate. In regard to the former, Major Knox, who had informally visited Basrah and Pao to obtain material for a full report, sympathised with the attitude of the Turkish military authorities and considered that they had good reason for destroying the Sheikh’s dam. As to the second claim, Major Knox was of opinion that it was open to doubt whether Sheikh Mubarak had not committed a serious aggres sion, involving valuable property to the north of his estates, and that the British Govern ment had no possible jurisdiction or pretext for interference in the matter which appeared to be one for the Turkish Courts to settle. Major Cox was of opinion that, apart from any consideration as to the correctness or other wise of the Sheikh’s claims as to which Major Knox’s opinion was probably right, it was beyond dispute that the Sheikh was extremely sore in regard to the treatment he had received in connection with his Pao properties, and that the matter touched the Sheikh much more closely than any of the current questions of ownership affecting other localities in his reputed territory, such as Bubiyan, Urn Kasr or Warba. He added that it was clear that the failure of the British Government to give him the active assistance which he had looked for in the present difficulty was prejudicingV 8 his attitude towards them in other important connections, such as, the quarantine and house- rent questions. What the Sheikh had con sistently pressed for was a committee of enquiry by the finding of which he agreed to abide. Major Cox, therefore, expressed the hope that it might still be considered expedient as well as feasible, in the interests of the British Government’s general relations with the Sheikh, to endeavour to get the Porte to a/ree to the appointment of a Committee, composed of persons agreeable to borh parties, to investigate the Sheikh’s claims exhaustively. He considered that the presence of Major Knox or of His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, if not as a member of the Committee, might be pressed for to watch the proceedings for the information of His Majesty’s Government. The Government of India, in forwarding the correspondence to His Majesty’s Secretary of State, stated that, although it was possible that the Sheikh would not succeed in con vincing the Turkish authorities, they agreed with Major Cox that it was most desirable, on political grounds, that a recommendation should be made to the Porte to appoint a Committee consisting of persons agreeable to both parries for the final settlement of the matters in dispute. They added that it would also be an advantage if, as proposed by Major Cox, a British officer were permitted to be present, and suggested that, if His Majesty’s Government were able to make such a recom mendation, the British Consul at Basrah be nominated for the purpose. 178. [Vide para. 17, July 1906.) On Rightsof the Sheikh of ^ ie 01 November Koweit over the islands 1907, the Government of Bubiyan and Warba. ()f India i n f ormed His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India that, owing to a misunderstanding on the part of the Political Agent, Koweit, the Bunder Shweikjh foreshore agreement included an addi tional clause giving a right of pre-emption to the entire island of Warba, situated nepr Khor Abdullah, and its surrounding foreshore (vide para. 195, October 1907). They, however, subsequently reported that, in their opinion, the inclusion, in the lease, of the right of pre emption to W T arba island, which merely con veyed to them the Sheikh’s rights for what they were worth, could in no circumstances embarrass them even if the Sheikh’s title to the island were doubtful. On the 20th November 1907, the Secretary of State asked that the Political Agent might be instructed to ascertain the nature of the Sheikh’s claims to Warba island from the Sheikh in such a manner that it would not lead him to think that the British Government were prepared to support those claims. He added that, until V v50 9 the claims had been investigated, His Majesty’s Government would not be in a position to con sider whether further action should be taken in respect of the island. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was informed accordingly. On the 10th September 1908, the Govern ment of India forwarded to the Secretary of State copies of correspondence received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of the rights of the Sheikhs of Koweit over the islands of Bubiyan and Warba. As regards Bubiyan island, they stated that the evidence which the Political Agent at Koweit had now collected showed that, until * the recent establishment there of a post by the Turkish authorities, the island had been in the exclusive occupation of the Awazim tribe, who had exercised for generations hereditary fish ing rights in virtue of grants made by the Sheikhs of Koweit, and that the authority of the Sheikhs to make such grants had hitherto never been disputed. They considered that these facts confirmed the view as to the Sheikh’s claim to the island of Bubiyan which they had put forward in paragraph 5 of their Secret despatch No. 25 (External), dated the 4th February 1904. As regards the coast line from Km Kasr to Sabiya, they considered that, in the absence of any reliable evidence that the Ahmed bin Rizk, who was alleged by Sheikh Mubarak to have built the old fort and dug the Urn Kasr wells, was a Koweit • subject, the Sheikh’s claim rested on the existence of old settlements founded by Koweit subjects on the western bank of the Khor Sabiya and on the fact that the coast line was actually in the occupation of Koweit Arabs who recognised the authority of the Sheikh alone. They doubted whether the Sheikh’s title could be considered as fully established by these consi derations. The evidence as regards Warba island was, in their opinion, by no means conclusive. The* Sheikh claimed the island, which had apparently never been occupied, merely on ' geographical considerations, as the private proprietor, under a deed of settlement, of the opposite coast line from Fao to Khor Zubeir. So far, therefore, as Warba island jr an( l the Um Kasr-Sabiya coast were concerned, they thought His Majesty’s Government would probably prefer to await the result of the further enquiries which Major Cox had directed before taking active steps to assert the Sheikh’s claims. As regards Bubiyan island, the Government of India slated that they would be glad to be informed whether His Majesty’s Government contem plated addressing the Turkish Government in10 the matter, or whether they desired that a favourable opportunity should be taken to assist the Sheikh to establish his authority. The Government of India added that at present it would appear that the Sheikh was not anxious to move in the matter, and that, although they attached the greatest im portance to the assertion of the Sheikh’s rights in Bubiyan at an early date, they would not advise the location of a Koweit post on the island unless the hearty co-operation of the Sheikh could be counted on. 179. On the 18th August, the Political Dispute between Resident in the Persian Persian and Koweit Gulf reported that, on subjects on board a x t i British. India Company the 30th July, a (juarrel vessel at Koweit. had taken place at Koweit between Koweit and Persian subjects on board a British India Company’s vessel. In the absence of Sheikh Mubarak, the Poli tical Agent represented the matter to Sheikh Jabir who punished and warned his men who were the aggressors. Sheikh Mubarak, on his return, took umbrage at the Political Agent’s intervention in the dispute and intimated to the British India Company that their vessels were not required at Koweit. He also ordered the native agent of the Company to leave Koweit within eight days. The Political Agent suggested that the Bombay-Persian Company, whom the Sheikh had invited to send vessels to Koweit, should be requested not to do so until the principle was established that the proper channel of communication between the Sheikh and British subjects and firms was through the Political Agent. Major Cox pointed out that the British India Company had been in the habit of settling their disputes direct with the Sheikh, and that they might prefer to continue this policy. He, however, suggested that the Gov ernment of India should ask the views of the British India Company through their Bombay Agent, and enquire from the latter whether he could square or otherwise dissuade the Bombay- Persian Company from sending vessels to Koweit. The Government of India replied that it would, in their opinion, be better for the present to leave the British India Company to settle matters direct with the Sheikh without the intervention of the Political Agent. They preferred not to make any suggestion to the British India Company as to their attitude towards the Bombay-Persian Company, and enquired whether the Resident could ascertain the wishes and intentions of the British India Company through their Bushire Agent. On the 27th August, Major Cox tele graphed that the Political Agent reported that51 11 Sheikh Muharak was veering round and was in readiness to come to an understanding, if the senior representative of the British India Company went to interview him. He added that the Company’s Agent at Basrah, who was their chief representative in the Persian Gulf, had been asked to pay a visit to the Sheikh. On the 16th September, Major Cox reported that the chief Agent of the British India Company had written to say that he had had an interview with the Sheikh at Mohammerah, and found him most affable. He hoped that the incident had been closed. 180. {Vide para. 46, March 1908.) Koweit and Nejd Writing on the 24th Affairs. July 1908 to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Constanti nople, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Damascus reported that certain information had reached him from a trustworthy source respecting recent affairs of the Nejd ending in the murder at Hail of Sultan Ibn Bashid by his brother Saood who had now succeeded him in the Emirlik of Hail. It appears that, after assassinating Mutib, Sultan Ibn Bashid succeeded in considerably strengthening his position with the tribes of Kassim and the neighbourhood against his rival Abdul Aziz- ibn-Saood. Subsequently, however, he alienated the confidence of the tribes by failing to respond readily to an invitation to march against his rival and by attempting to open negotia tions with the latter, and was eventually forced to abdicate in favour of his brother, Saood Ibn Bashid. Sultan Ibn Bashid then attempted to abscond to Teima, but was captured and thrown into prison at Hail. As soon as he was in power, Saood Ibn Bashid wrote to Ibn Saood at Kassim announcing to him the abdication of his brother Sultan and his succession to the Emirlik of Hail, declaring at the same time his readiness and earnest desire to accept the terms of the arrangement proposed and adopted by his brother and predecessor. Ibn Saood, on receiving the news, wrote back demanding the immediate release of Sultan Ibn Bashid, so that he might come over to Kassim and live in safe and honourable conditions with himself. The new Ibn Bashid fearing that his brother might be returned to power some day through the help of Ibn Saood, had him slain in prison, as also his young son. No other candidate now remains to dispute the supremacy of Ibn Saood save the only surviving son also named Saood of Abdul Aziz Ibn Bashid who was carried away to Medina 18th months ago. Events seem now to be leading towards the supremacy of Ibn Saoodand his effective ascendancy over the whole of Nejd, a position held by his ancestors throughout the last century and even earlier. 181. On the 8th March 1908, Major Cox, Quarantine arrange- the Political Resident mentB at Koweit. i n the Persian Gulf, addressing the Government of India on the subject of the improvements of the quarantine arrangements at Koweit, stated that Major Knox, the Political Agent, Koweit, had suggested that the Government of India should equip and maintain a quarantine establishment on the lines of those at other ports in the Persian Gulf, and that the island of Shweikh should be occupied for the quaran tine station, the fishermen being compensated by a rent of Rs. 200 per mensem and a sum of Rs. 25,000 being paid to Sheikh Mubarak as rent for the island and for certain other con siderations. With regard to these suggestions the Political Resident expressed the opinion that the question of leasing Shweikh island on the terms proposed was quite distinct from the question of quarantine and should not be mixed up with it unless the Defence Com mittee saw any advantage in obtaining control of the island in this way. Major Cox considered that the Sheikh might reasonably be expected to permit the quarantine station to be placed on the island of Shweikh free of charge so long as the fishermen were placated seeing that the institution of quarantine would really be advantageous to the people of Koweit. As regards the sum of Rs. 200 per mensem which it was proposed to distribute among the fishermen of the island it was observed that, although the quarantine station of Bushire was on the island of Abbassek where certain Persians have fishery rights, no compensation had ever been paid to them. The fishermen were permitted to fish anywhere from boats, but were not allowed to land within a certain distance of the quarantine station. Major Cox considered that a similar arrangement might be feasible at Koweit. Major Cox was of opinion that suitable accommodation could be provided at a cost of about Rs. 8,000 initial expenditure and recurring charges amounting to some Rs. 3,000 per annum. He proposed that the quarantine fees to be charged should be approximately the same as those levied in Persian ports. The Sheikh, it was added, was not particularly anxious to have quarantine, and it would be impossible to get him to pay the working expenses. In view, therefore, of the import ance which His Majesty’s Government attached to the establishment of British controlled quarantine throughout the Gulf, Major Cox urged that the Government of India should offer to take over the direct management of13 the Koweit quarantine, and that it should he carried on as a charge on the Government revenues. On the 7th June, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that Major Knox had suggested an arrangement whereby the vessels of the British India Steam Navigation Company would carry on board a guard furnished at the expense of the Government of India. By this means quarantine could be enforced, as far as these vessels were con cerned, with indifference to the wishes and attitude of the Sheikh. Major Knox, in two further reports, drew attention to the un satisfactory attitude of Sheikh Mubarak in regard to the quarantine question, and suggested that he was purposely thwarting our plans in regard to quarantine in order to compel us to give him a greater measure of assistance in resisting Turkish amenities in connection with his properties at Pao. As regards the action that could best be taken to bring the Sheikh to a more reasonable frame of mind in regard to his quarantine arrangements, Major Knox suggested a formal intimation to the Sheikh that the Government of India could not permit Koweit to defy the world in general, that it would shortly formulate proposals for a proper system of quarantine to be managed by its own officers, and that, in the meanwhile, the fast mails would no longer call at Koweit. Major Cox was inclined to think that to make an intimation to the Sheikh forthwith in this sense might confirm him in bis obstructive attitude and perhaps produce a deadlock. He intended addressing Sheikh Mubarak on the matter, and, if his reply was unsatisfactory, the effect of the suspension of the visits of the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Bombay Persian line might be tried. On the 10th August, Major Cox reported that Sheikh Mubarak complained that the princes of Arabia had taken objection to the quarantine restrictions imposed on their families and followers landing at Koweit, and had indirectly intimated that, if the Government of India did not co-operate with him in the matter of his Pao properties, he could not be expected to defer to their wishes in regard to quarantine administration. Major Cox remarked that, while there was a measure of truth in the assertion that the Sheikh had to meet frequent demurs on the part of the Sheikhs of the interior whose families or followers were subjected to quarantine de tention on arrival at Koweit his statement in this regard were doubtless much exaggerated. As the Sheikh of Koweit had spontaneously asked the British India Sieam Navigation Com pany to cease booking passengers to Koweit bythe fast mail steamers, Major Cox was of opi nion that no need tor any immediate action on our part seemed to exist. He added that, until the f olitical side of the question was decided, it was diihcult for the .Residency Surgeon to make revised suggestions from a medical point of view. The extent to which Sheikh Mubarak was likely to be guided by our advice in the matter in the near future depended on the measure of assistance which the British Gov ernment gave him in connection with his Fao properties. As there was no epidemic in the Gulf itself and as the slow mails were out of quarantine before they reached Roweit the Sheikh’s solution of the difficulty would suffice for the time being, unsatisfactory though his attitude undoubtedly was. 182.

Williams, I.M.S., the Chief Quarantine officer in the Persian Gulf, brought to the notice of Dr. Listemann, the German Consul, Bushire, that on the 10th June, Herr Krumpeter, the Agent of the Hamburg-American Line, together with his wife, boarded the S.S. “ Galicia ” before she had been inspected by the medical officer and given pratique, which was quite contrary to the Quarantine Regulations of the Port. The German Consul, Bushire, replying on the 16th June, stated that he had no inform ation about any regulations which might have been laid down, particularly for the port of Bushire, and requested to be supplied with a copy of the rules and of the circumstances in which they were published. He further stated that when Herr Krumpeter boarded the steamer she was neither in the port nor in the Bushire anchorage. The desired inform, ation was supplied by Captain Williams, and the incident was satisfactorily closed.i ! mMHMT ' * Provision of a Clayton Capptain A. P.

On the 12th August, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India was informed by telegram that Major Cox and Mr. Marling thought that it would be well to delay obtaining the barge for the apparatus until about the time of the return to Tehran of the President of the Council, as there then would be small risk of any awkward discussion as to the destination of the apparatus until after the situation had been explained to the President whom Captain Williams would see in Paris. It was stated that the Government of India saw no objection to the proposal but in view of the importance which the Foreign Office attached to the prompt provision of the apparatus, the opinion of the Secretary of State was asked for on the point. On the 5th September 1908, His Majesty’s Secretary of State telegraphed that as suggested the provision of the barge might be delayed. \ On the 8th September, information to this effect was sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Afifaires, Tehran. 185.

Office, forwarding a copy of Major Cox’s despatch of the 7th June on the subject of the trade in mother-of- pearl shells in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Marling, His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, remarked that it could hardly be doubted that Messrs. W^onckhaus were either in receipt of a Government subsidy or profitted by some arrangement with the German Government which offered a reason able guarantee against loss. In the circum stance, it was evidently uphill work for the British firm unaided to maintain its position. Mr. Marling hoped that such encouragement as could be properly given, would be afforded to British firms by His Majesty’s Government. On the 27th August 1908, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India telegraphed that he approved the views expressed by the Gov ernment of India in their telegram of the 21st July 1908, regarding the pearl shell industry. On the 30th August 1908, Major Cox was informed by telegraph of the above views of the Secretary of State.16 186. On the 24th July 1908, Major Cox, The appointment by the Political Resident the Bombay and Persian in the rersian LrUil, panT o 3 ?“^ at i 0 gen C t° at r e p o r t e d t h a t the Bushire. Persian who had been for some years the Agent for the Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company at Bushire had died, and that several persons, among whom was a party of German employes, were intriguing to secure the Agency. Major Cox remarked that the line was under the British flag and was identified with pilgrim traffic, consequently that it was important that the Company’s Agent should be a man in whom full reliance could be placed. Major Cox was of opinion that it would be helpful if the Poli tical Department in Bombay could communi cate and support any reference made by him to the head-quarters of the Company in ques tion, warning them of the necessity for the exercise of great caution in the selection ot the new Agent who, in the interest of the companv, should be an individual who could be relied on by the British Consul-General at Bushire. The Bombay Government who were in formed on the 27th July of Major Cox’s views in the matter intimated on the 14th August that the Governor in Council was prepared to support any representation that Major Cox might make to the Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company with the object of securing a suitable Agent at Bushire, and that they had informed that officer accord- ino-lv. Later, on the 1st September, the Bombay Government reported that the Agent, Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company, had indicated that he had appointed a new Agent at Bushire on the 21st July, and that in select ing him the Company had been influenced by the importance of the fact that he should be a man in whom both the British Government and their representative can feel complete confidence. The Agent added that Major Cox had apparently not been made fully acquainted with the actual facts and of the antecedents of his nominee, as had they been known to him as well as they were to the Company’s Agent they would have sufficiently provided for his rejection as one absolutely unfit for the position in question. 187 On the 26th August, the Secretary PERSIAN GULP. of State f ° r Illdia Installation of wire less telegraphy on vessels employed in the called for the views of the Government of _ . India as to the desir- ibility of fitting the three subsidised vessels employed in the Persian Gulf with apparatus for wireless telegraphy. mOn the 21st September, the G overnment of India replied that the installation on the three subsidised vessels would be of great advantage not only for the suppression of aims traffic but also for general police work in the Gulf. It would be necessary, for the foimer purpose, to establish a shore station at seme convenient point probably Henjam, and for general purposes it would be desirable to have stations at Bahrein and Koweit also. The proposal was, it was pointed out, strongly advocated by Major Cox. The cost for installations on the three ships was estimated at about Bs. 22,£C0 initial, and Bs. 245 monthly recuiring. Ike cost of a land station 'with four masts at Jask or Benjam, where there vere telegraph stations, was esti mated at about Bs. 35,CIO initial and Bs. 365 monthly recurring, and at Bahrein or Koweit Bs. 22,CC0 initial, exclusive of buildings, and Bs. 947 monthly recurring. The cost of the installation on the vessels might, it was suggested, be met by the Admiralty, the Heme and India Exchequers equally dividing the charges for the shore station.ARABIAN SHORE OF THE PERSIAN GULF. 197. {Vide para. 10$ of the Memorandum Sirri island red oxide JOr June 1908,) With concession. reference to an enquiry from Mr. Marling as to what reply should be given to the Agent of Messrs. Hadji Ali, Akbar &amp; Co., who was anxious to open negotiations for the acquisition of the concession, the Secretary of State intimated on the 19th September, that, when applying for the concession, it would sufTice if the Persian Government were informed that the controversy, as to the ownership of the island of Sirri, had not been reciprocally settled and that, should a concession be granted to an applicant not approved by His Majesty’s Gov ernment, it would lead to an assertion of the claims of the Jowasmi Chief. Subsequently, on the 21st September, Mr. Marling suggested to LI is Majesty’s Secretary of State the insertion of the words “and on conditions” after the word “applicant ” in the communication to the Persian Government, and, as the Company had not yet been recog nised by the Persian Government as a British firm, he proposed, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, to impress upon Hadji Ali Akbar Co.’s Agent the desirability of making an application as the representative of a British firm. 198. {Vide para. 194 of the Memorandum BAHREIN. 1 ° r British protection of On the 2nd September, Bahreinese in the Otto- H i S Britannic man Dominions. -\t • a &gt; * i i Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople forwarded to Sir E.

Mr. Geary reported that the men were in possession of passports from their Chief and also of a document signed by Major Prideaux, Political Agent at Bahrein, recommending them to the good offices of British Consular officials. The Ottoman Government had attempted to enforce military service in the Turkish Army on one of these men, but they had protested against the attempt and appealed to the Consulate for protection. Mr. Geary refused their demand as they appeared to have no claim to British nationality, but asked for instructions as to the extent to which protection, if any, should be aff orded to such claimants. In reply, Sir Gerard Lowther quoted instances in which His Majesty’s2 Government had repudiated Turkish and Persian claims to sovereignty over Bahrein, and pointed out that in 1871 a formal assur ance had been given by Turkey “ that the Porte entertained no intention whatever of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein His Majesty’s Government had consistently maintained the right of British Consular Representatives to give their good offices to Bahreinese applying for them. Mr. Geary was accordingly instructed to extend protec tion to the natives of Bahrein in conformity with these precedents.fc MASKAT. 199. ( Vide para. 150 of the Memorandum for August 1908.) On ItiSSn an the 16th October, the Secretary of State tele graphed that, in view of the remote prospect of a settlement of the arms traffic question at Maskat, the Italian Government represented the necessity of sending Captain Crisp! there at once as their Agent. They stated that his mission would have no political aims, but. would furnish valuable information, and, in the circumstances, was the only means avail able to them to take steps to check the im portant arms traffic between Maskat and Somaliland, where the attitude of the Mullah made the matter urgent. The views of the Government of India were invited on the subject. After consultation with the Political Resident at Bushire, the Government of India expressed the opinion that it was import ant to exclude an Italian Agent, if possible, at any rate until the result of the arms con ference was known. They added that it would be worth while to concert special measures to secure the objects of the Italian Government by utilising the support and co-operation of the British Agent at Maskat, who could tele graph all the information which could be collected regarding the arms traffic to Aden for transmission to the Italian authorities in ■j-ARABIAN SHORE OF THE PERSIAN GULF. 210. On the 20th October, the Secretary of Mining concessions in State, at the instance of the Persian Gulf. Messrs. Strict &amp; Co., called for the views of the Government of India in regard to the procedure which should be followed by that firm in order to obtain mining concessions on Sirri, Little Tanb, Nabiva Farur and other islands in the Persian Gulf. As regards Sirri, Sir E. Grey proposed to re dy as in his telegram of the 19th Septem ber to Mr. Morley (vide Memorandum for October, para. 197), After reference to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Government of India expressed the opinion that, as the flag of the Sheikh of Shargah had been flown on the island of Greater Tanb though not on Little Tanb, it could be claimed that the ownership of the latter followed that of the parent island. They accordingly, as regards these inlands, agreed in the proposal of the Secretary of State to support Messrs. Strick &amp; Co.’s appli cation for a mining concession, the negotiations to be conducted with the Sheikh of Shargah through the Resident. On the same analogy the ownership of Little Farur would follow that of Greater Farur which was Persian property, and, consequently, Messrs. Strick would, in the opinion of the Government of India, have to apply in this case to the Persian Government. Sirri Island concession. oxide It was not anticipated that the procedure on the lines suggested in regard to Little Tanb and Little Farur need raise any awkward questions, but, if thought desirable, Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. might be asked, as suggested by Major Cox, to make an examination in the first place of the deposits on the islands of Dalma, Sir Abu Nuair, and Halul. 211. {Vide para, 197 of the Memo randum for October.) On the 22nd October, Sir G. Barclay reported that the Agent of Messrs. Haji Ali Akbar &amp; Co. had submitted a draft of the concession for which he was about to apply. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister considered that certain of the conditions, e.g., that respecting a royalty of 12 per cent, on the net profits, would involve an admission of Persian sovereignty over the island and that, if a communication was made to the Persian Government as suggested by Mr. Marling, approval of the conditions would prejudice the Jowasmi claims and their rejec tion would jeopardise the Company’s chance of obtaining the concession. Sir G. Barclay, there fore, proposed to substitute for Mr. Marling’s2 'i; suggested amendment the following :—“It must be clearly understood that such conditions as may be attached to the concessions shall not prejudice the question of the disputed status of the island. ,, 212.

On the 18th September, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, reported to His Excellency the Naval Com- mander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, that all was quiet at Katif. On the arrival there of the Turkish reinforcements on the 28th August, a truce had been established and a peace agreement subsequently signed by the Bedouin and Katitis. The civil official who accompanied the troops had, it was stated, suspended the Kaimmakam and arrested six of the principal Katif merchants including the customs farmer. The Turkish expedi tionary force returned to Basrah on the Idth September. 214. (Vide para. ISO of the Memo randum for September.) On the 28th September, Mr. Devey (His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Damascus) reported to the British Embassy at Constantinople that the Sebhan clan of the Shammar tribe, under the leadership of Hamoud ibn Sebhan, had organised a strong raid against Saoud ibn Rashid and attacked him in Hail. The latter was totally deserted by his men and could not resist the attack of the raiders, who entered the town and killed him together with his brother Faisal. Hail and the tribe of Shammar are said to be, at present, presided over by Hamoud ibn Sebhan, the maternal uncle and guardian of Saoud ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid, the young boy now at Medina, who is too young to take up the rule of his father Abdul Aziz and his brother Mutib. The Principality of Hail, from the death of Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid, who was killed about September 1906, to the present date, has been governed by four Emirs, namely :— (1) Mutib ibn Abdul Aziz from Septem ber 1906 to February 1907.

On the 5th October, Major Cox for warded to the Tehran Legation a further report from the Residency Agent, Lingah, on the subject. The report showed that the three murderers, who were brothers, were still alive and %t large, in spite of the statements of the Persian Government to the contrary. The pearls, belonging to the victims, had been taken to Taona by the murderers and were eventually sold for a sum of 1,500 dollars to one Saad bin Abdalla Someiti, a diver, residing at Lingah. The latter, however, was believed to have purchased the pearls in &amp; bond fide com mercial transaction and to have been in no way concerned in the crime. The investigations of the Residency Agent also showed that the Zabits of Nakl-i-Amir and Taona and the Governor of Bustek had one and all assisted the pirates at one stage or another and had directly or indirectly partaken of the proceeds of the outrage ; also that a fourth local Head man, the Zabit of the port of Moghu, had been added to the list. Major Cox was inclined to think that the best course was to use the details at present brought into prominence as a basis for another insistent demand for the payment of compensation. He stated that if the Persian Government would capture the men it would be so much the better, but he earnestly depre cated any pretended or real endeavours 0 n their part to capture them being allowed ^ block the demand for the payment of co m . pensation. He asked for the views or instr uc [ ticn* of the Tehran Legation on the matter.MA8KAT. 216.

He requested that instructions should be issued to the Political Agent at Maskat to telegraph to Aden, for transmission to the authorities in the Italian Somali land Protectorate, all the information which he could collect regarding the movements of vessels conveying arms to that Protectorate, and to render any assistance in other ways that might he suggested by the Italian authorities.

On the 13th October, Consul Devey stated that Saoud Ibn Rashid had not, as previously reported, been killed in the recent disturbances at Hail, but had been deposed and imprisoned.

There was no objection, however, to the continuance of the further enquiries that were being made under the directions of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf as to the Sheikh’s rights in those localities. 229. On the 16th November, His Majesty’s Government signified their approval of the modification proposed by Sir G. Barclay in the draft of the concession for which Messrs. Hadji Ali Akbar &amp; Co. were about to apply to the Persian Government (vide paragraph 21L of the Memorandum for November 1908). Oxide mining conces sions in the Persian Gulf. It was added that Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. appeared to be desirous of securing a concession on Sirri island, but it was not considered that their application, should they decide to make one, could be actively supported to the detriment of that of Messrs. Hadji Ali Akbar, though, if in the exercise of their discretion, the Persian Government were to prefer to accept the offer of the former firm, His Majesty’s Government w r ould not be under any obliga tion to interpose a veto in consequence of the form of the pledge given to the latter firm. In regard to the Hormuz concession (vide paragraph 14 of the Memorandum for October 1908) Sir G. Barclay w T as informed that Messrs. Strick &amp; Co.’s communications with the Persian Government did not, so far as His Majesty’s Government were aware, relate to Hormuz, but were confined to the island of Sirri, and Sir G. Barclay was instructed to inform the Moin on this point and assure him that His Majesty’s Government would maintain a friendly attitude towards him, provided he did not act in opposition to British commercial interests.2 As Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. appeared to consider their position in regard to Hormuz a strong one, and it was clear that Messrs. Ellinger &amp; Co. wore unable to form a Com pany, Sir G. Barclay was instructed to take no action in connection with this question though it would probably be desirable that the Moin should come to terms with Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. in order to avoid the concession passing under German control. On the 3rd December, Sir G. Barclay reported that as the Agent of Messrs.
