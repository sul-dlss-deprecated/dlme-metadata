Much of the correspondence discusses the Sultan's ambition to secure the allegiance of the Omani shaikhs and consolidate his authority in the interior of Oman. The correspondence recounts meetings between British representatives and the Sultan, in which the Sultan discusses his intentions to assert control in the Omani interior once the Imam of Oman has died, and requests British assistance in order to do so.In addition, the file contains extensive discussion regarding British policy in relation to the internal affairs of Oman. Matters covered include whether the Sultan should be supplied with arms, ammunition, and RAF assistance, and whether the British should approach the Omani tribes directly, in order to smooth the way for oil exploitation in the interior. Also covered are exchanges of correspondence and meetings between certain Omani shaikhs and the British representatives at Muscat.As well as correspondence, the file contains compiled notes on the principal shaikhs and tribes of Oman (ff 5-9), and notes on the tribes of Buraimi and Trucial Oman (ff 118-135, including details of tribes beyond the limits of Trucial Oman and within the limits of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman), the latter being described by the Political Resident as 'scanty'.The Arabic language material consists of several items of correspondence, of which English translations are included.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Internal politics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000011#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000011#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
