I. (I) 116 of 1936 since repro duced as A. I. (I) 401143, is governed on transfer from a Civil Department to the Defence Department oi the Government of India or vice versa, by Rule 9 in Section II of Appendix 3 to the Account Code, Volume I. This rul^Ses not apply to temporary Government servants who may be so ira^ ^erred before they are confirmed. To provide for such cases the Governor General in Council is pleased to decide that in the case of a tenlporary Government servant vho, before his confirmation, is tprans- feired from Civil to the Defence Department, or vice versa, the leave salary should be burne by the second or subsequent departments in the reverse order of employment up to the limit of leave earned under each &gt; department and the excess, if any, charged to the Department under which he obtained his first temporary employment. 2. When such a Government servant is confirmed without interruption of duty and t-ikcs leave thereafter, the additional leave that may become due to him under the Rules in respect of his duty in the department or departments other than that in which he is confirmed should be.exhausted first and the leave-salary allocated in reverse order as in para. 1 above, treating the department—Civil or Defence, as the case may be, in which he is confirmed as the lending department. . 3. These orders do not apply to a temporary Government servant who passes from one Department to another after resigning his post or being discharged. In his case the leave earned and not availed of before the date of his resignation o r discharge will lapse. I have the honour to be, SiR.' Your most obedient servani. B.

It has 'been 'brought to notice that the duration of serrice contracts, and similar instruments, executed 'by Government Departments and Attached or Subordinate Autho rities, is often defined 'by such expressions as 'for the duration of the war', 'for the duration of the present Qmergency', 'till the termination of hostilities' etc. To enable the date of termination of such contracts, deeds, etc., to 'be clearly ascertained and to facilitate defining legislation irtiich may subsequently 'be necessary, it is suggested that these expressions when used should 'be accom? panied by a standard definition in the body of the document on the following lines 'For the purpose of this agreement the present war/ present emergency, etc., shall be treated as having continued to, and as having ended on, such date as the Central Government may declare.' 2. It is suggested that Departments should take steps to ensure that some such definition is included in all future contracts, deeds, etc., intended to last for the duration of the war. Departments are also requested to indicate to this Department the forms they have been adopting so that they may be considered while examining the question of defining legj^ation. They will no doubt, consider the possibility of amending existing contracts where desirable by agreement with the other party. A .S.

The position is approaching when the earliest appointee under contracts of the nature indicated above will be completing live years' service and the question of the interpretation of the term ' Temporarily resident abroad iU isuch cases will now require to be decided, as indicated in your letter quoted above. 3. The High Commissioner would therefore be glad if the Ministry ot Health would kindly consider the position and advise him whether appointees may continue as voluntary contributors for lieialth insurance for any period beyond live years or whether sueh insurance must terminate at the expiration of five years. The favour of a reply at the earliest practicable date would be appreciated in order that appointees may be apprised of their position before the expiration of five years' service. Copy of the Insurance Department letter No. X2B 7001 15770, dated the 17 th April , 1944. In reply to your letter of the 3rd April, I have to state that if, as is under stood will normally be the case, the continued absence abroad of the personnel concerned is due to war conditions, voluntary health insurance may be conti nued beyond the period of five years. I have to add, however, that if at any time an appointee accepts a perma nent post in the service of the Government of India he would forthwith cease to be entitled to pay voluntary contributions for health insurance purposes.

In accordance with the above provision, the maximum amount attach able by a Civil Court is to be calculated thus :— If the total gross emoluments earned by the Government servant are represented by X, and the allowances declared to be exempt from attachment {vide note 2 to Rule 225) and, if the Government servant is under suspension, any subsistence grant or allowance made to him, are represented by K, the nr. amount attach able, if any, is X—Y- 50.

Subject s AWARDS FROM THE COMPASSIONATE I am directed to Invite your attention to Items (9) and (10) of the Appendix to the Rules regulating the Compassionate Fund of the Government of India (copy enclosed). These Items relate to the descriptive rolls and Independent report on the financial condition of the deceased which have necessarily to be obtained from District authorities before dealing with a case for gratuity from the Fond. The Government of India have noticed that considerable delay continues to be caused by the authorities concerned In the supply of these documents. Awards from the Fund are Intended to help the dependents of the deceased Government servants to tide over the difficulties which may face them Immediately after the death of the earning member, delay In sanctioning any grant therefore detracts greatly from the usefulness of the grant. I am, therefore, to request that. If there Is no objection, instructions may be Issued to the District authorities under your control to the effect that all references regarding gratuity from the Fund should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. In this connection I am also to suggest that all Fund cases should be handled In each District by a single responsible officer who should maintain a register of all such cases and issue reminders to the lower authorities periodically whenever necessary.

By order, etc., Sd. B. L. Batra.Rules Regulating The Compassionate Fund Of The GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. 1. The Compassionate Fund is Intended for the relief of the families of Government servants paid monthly from Central revenues, whether their rates of pay are fixed on a dally or a monthly basis 9 If they are left In Indigent circumstances on account of the premature death of the person upon whom they depended for support. Its scope Is limited to the dependents of those who served In or under t - (a) Civil Departments, Including the Financial Adviser, Military Finance, and the Railway Department, but excluding the Posts and Telegraphs Department, (b) The Army and Marine Departments If they were subject to the Civil Service Regulations, or (c) Minor Local Governments and Administrations i Provided that no application will be considered from dependents of Government servants who were subscribers to a contributory provident fund (Including the State Railway Provident Fund) or come within the scope of the State Railway Gratuity Rules t Provided further that no application will be considered which Is not submitted to the department of the Government of India concerned within one year of the death of the Government servant, unless the delay In submission Is sufficiently explained. It Is *ost desirable that applications should be submitted as promptly as possible after the death of a Government servant. The Fund is formed by an annual grant of Bs 40,000, which is cumulative, the unexpended balance of each yea^s grant being carried forward for expenditure In succeeding years. The maximum limit of expenditure In any single year Is £s 46,000# 2. The conditions which regulate a grant from the Fund are i - (1) Grants from the Fund are restricted to cases of an exceptional character. (2) The deceased officer must have been a meritorious public servant. Unusually meritorious service gives special claim for consideration. (3) Death due to special devotion to duty establishes a strong claim for consideration. (4) In more ordinary cases preference should be given to the dependents of officers who have completed many years service and have just failed to draw their pension (6) Other things being equal, preference should be given to those who have been on low rates of pay. (6) As a general rule a grant should not be given if the salary of the deceased officer exceeded Ks 760 a month* (7) Assistance should seldom be given to families of gazetted officers except so far as it may be necessary to assist them to obtain a passage home. (8) Care should be taken that too many grants are not made to families of officers who have been serving at the headquarters of the Government of India. 3. The rules for sanctioning grants are : - (1) No pension is granted from the Fund, but in some cases yearly grants are made for a limited period to defray the expenses of the education of children. (2) The n&gt;»-rlnmiw gratuity payable in any individual case is Bs 6,000. The precise amount in all cases is fixed according to the number in the family and the necessities of the case, the equivalent of a year's / pay of the• 2 - . V 1 jy pay of the deceased being considered a suitable maxlmuB) in cases in which the circumstances are such as to require liberal treatment, but in most ordinary cases, six months 1 pay is regarded as sufficient. A. The Fund will be administered by a Committee appointed by the Government of India, The administrative Department will forward to the Finance Department applications for the grant of a gratuity with other relevant documents and on their receipt the facts will be summarised and put up with out comment. The Committee's decision will be taken once every three months and will be communicated by the Finance Department direct to the applicant, the Department concerned and the Accountant General concerned. A list of the awards sanctioned will also be furnished to the Accountant General, Central Revenues. If payment is to be made to a person resident in England, the Finance Department will address the High Commissioner for India for the payment to be made. A 6. Cases relating to grants from the Compassionate Fund will not be submitted to Kis Excellency the Viceroy. The following particulars should be furnished in each case of recommendation for the grant of an award from the Compassionate Fund : - ■ ^ • (1) Name of the deceased, lest appointment held; pay at time of death and the date of death. (2) Total service (whether pensionable or non-pensionable) (3) (a) Dependents (with their respective ages). (b) Their pecuniary* circumstances.

SUBJECT t Question regarding the grant of compensation to an officer or his dependants In the event of his receiving an injury or meeting death while travelling on duty by air. In the present emergency Government servants are frequently required to travel In India on duty by air, and the number of cases of officers proceeding by air on deputation outside India has also Increased. The Government of India have had under consideration the question to what extent compensation should be granted to an officer or his dependants In the event of hit r ??? ivlag *** or billed as a result of an accident, while travelling on duty by air. It has been decided that, as a temporary measure and for the duration of the war, the case of each such officer will be regulated by the provisions of the relevant extraordinary pension rules, for the time being In force, governing disability or family pension, as the case may be. Officers who are frequently required to travel by air for the necessary performance of their duties should obtain the general orders of Government. In other cases permission to cover Individual journeys should be obtained in advance from the head of the department or, where the officer is himself the head of a department, from Government. 2. In this connection the Government of India have also considered carefully proposals to reimburse to the officer additional premla paid by him to cover any such risk or to make good the difference between the sum assured and what the officer or his estate would actually get from the Insurance Company if no extra premium had been paid by the officer for the special risk undertaken. They have come to the conclusion that there is no justification for the grant of this concession in addition to that admissible as a temporary measure under the relevant extraordinary pension rules as a result of the decision communicated in paragraph 1 above. If therefore the officer wishes to ensure that his estate should receive the full sum assured he should meet the cost from his own pocket. Sd. B. C. A. Cook.

AIYANGAR, ESQ. f M.B.E., Deputy Secretary to the Goyerament of India* To All ProviMcial Governments and Chief Commissioners. SUBJECT s Grant of extended leave preparatory to retirement in the case of officers subject to the rule-making control of the Secretary of State in relaxation of Arts. 234 and 555 of the Civil Service Regulations or Fundamental Rule 86* Sir, In continuation of the Government of India. Home Department, letter No. 277/43-Ests., dated the 19ih January 9 1945| on the subject mentioned above, I am directed to state for your information that the Secretary of State has approved of the following procedure for the grant of extended leave preparatory to retirement in relaxation of Arts. 234 and 555 of the Civil Service Regulations or of Fundamental Rule 86, as the case may be. The intention is to grant the full amount of leave for which they would otherwise have been eligible, subject to a maximum of 28 months, to officers who have been compulsorily retained in active service beyond the date on which they would normally have had to proceed on leave in order to enjoy all the leave admissible to them. 2* The concession will be applicable to all officers under the rule-making control of the Secretary of- State who were im service, otherwise than on leave preparatory to retirement, on 1st November, 1940, and had not reached the age of compulsory retirement on that date t I Provided that, in the case of officers, not being members of the Indian Civil Service, who reached the age of compulsory retirement between the 1st November, 1940 (the date of the Secretary of State 1 s order Requiring Indian Civil Service officers to remain in active service until the completion of 35 years 1 service), and the 19th January, 1945 Cthe date of the Secretary of State's order requiring all officers under his rule-making control to remain in active service until they reach the age of compulsory retirement), the Provincial Government or the appropriate Department of the Government of India under whose control such officers were serving certify that they were retained in service, until the age of compulsory retirement, in the public interest. 3. In respect of officers eligible for the concession who have already attained the age of compulsory retirement on the date of these orders, the Government concerned will obtain from the audit officer a statement of leave due to the officer and leave, if any, actually availed of subsequently. In the case of officers due to retire after the date of these orders, a / similar certificate7 ^ / j •Imllar certificate should be obtained from the audit officer showlmg the leave that would be due to him oh the date of hli compulsory retirement. Except In the case of services for which a general ban was imposed on the grant of permission to take leave preparatory to retirement, an application for leave and a specific refusal of leave In the public Interest will be essential conditions of eligibility for the concession* 4» The appropriate departments of the Government of India or of the Provincial Government, as the case may be, should forward direct to the Secretary of State, as soon as possible after the date of these orders and at intervals convenient to them thereafter, a list of officers eligible for the concession, based on the information obtained as in paragraph 3 above. It has been decided that these lists should, as nearly as possible, be in the form annexed hereto, so that tbe Secretary of State may have all the relevant available information, before deciding on the actual period of leave to be granted. The Secretary of State for India is being requested to cormaunicate his order regarding the grant of leave to the officers concerned direct to the administrative department of the Government of India or the Provincial Government in respect of the lists forwarded by them. The decisions of the Secretary of State relating to the various individual officers will be Included in comprehensive orders covering all cases submitted to him by the Government of India and Provincial Governments. These Governments will then take suitable action to notify the leave after deducting from the total period of leave approved the actual periods of leave, if any, enjoyed by the officer, subsequent to the date of the report to the Secretary of State. 6# Any officer who has applied for and accepted extension of service will not be eligible for the concession as his retention in service will obviously not be compulsory. But the concession will be granted to officers who were compulsorily retained in service, whether by general or individual orders, up to the date of retirement provided that the administrative department of the Government of India or the Provincial Government certify that the officer*s service was extended in the public Interest. The extended leave preparatory to retirement will in such cases be the amount due on the date of compulsory retirement and no period of leave earned during the extension of service will be taken into account. Any officer of this category may elect, as an alternative to the enjoyment of the concession under these orders, to be governed by the ordinary rule in Fundamental Rule 86. 6. The relaxation of Fundamental Rule 86 herein explained will not carry with it any other departure from the leave amies applicable to the case of each officer. Thus the leave salary under these orders will be subject to the usual conditions regarding the amount of full pay leave admissible at a time, leave salary maximum etc., as laid down in the rules applicable to the service concerned. 7. The concession will cease from the date of withdrawal of the orders requiring officers to remain in active service until the date of compulsory retirement, but officers who have been affected by these orders will be entitled to take leave in accordance with the principles laid down for the concession. / 8./ 12. 8* The Secretary of State has also been pleased to direct that notwlthstandlMg the provisions of the Fundamental Rules and the Civil Service Regulations, a Government servant who retires from servlcei on or after the date of Issue of these orders, on the expiry of the leave granted to him thereunder, shall i - (1) have his lien on his permanent post terminated with effect from the conmencement of such leave. (11) have his average emoluments for the purposes of pension calculated under the provisions of Art, 487 of the Civil Service Regulations upon the last three years of his service, which for the purposes of this calculation shall be deemed to have terminated on the date of expiry of the first six months of such leave, or if the period enjoyed is less than six months, on the date of expiry of that period. (ill) count his leave as qualifying service for the purposes of Arts. 407 and 408 of the Civil Service Regulations, up to a maximum period of 6 months, and (iv) count as effective service for additional pension. that portion of the leave which corresponds to privilege leave, if he proceeds on leave from a post, service 1* which would otherwise qualify for additional pension under the rules. 9 # It is not the Intention that officers who have already retired should be denied the benefit of the present orders if they were in active service on 1st November, 1940, and were in fact refused leave up to date of compulsory retirement to which they were eligible. It is possible that some officers would not have been eligible for the maximum amount of leave that can be taken at any one time preparatory to retirement on the date when the ban on leave came into force. Such officers wo^ld then be eligible only for such leave after 1st November, 1940, as would take them to the date of compulsory retirement. In every case the leave benefit actually allowed under Fundamental Rule 86 will also be set off against the leave due. In the case of an officer who has already retired the re opening of his leave account will not in any way affect the amount of the pension already sanctioned. 10. The Government of India consider that in the case of those services where no ban has been Imposed on leave preparatory to retirement, it is unnecessary to provide for any relaxation of Fundamental Rule 86. For the rest, in regard to individual cases of officers under the control of the Governor-General who have been refused on public grounds leave preparatory to retirement, the Government of India have decided generally to extend the concession on the same scale as for Secretary of Stated officers. This will, however, be subject to the condition that in the case of Class I Service to which mo general ban was applied on the grant of leave preparatory to retirement only such leave as has been asked for and refused will be allowed although such leave may be in excess of the normal limit of 6 months prescribed in Fundamental Rule 86. 11. In the case of all the Railway Services a ban was imposed on leave preparatory to retirement and separate orders will issue from the Railway Department indicating the extent to which the present concession will apply to Secretary oi State's officers and officers under the rule-making control of the Governor-General in Council serving on the railways.- 4 - 12.

GOVERN TENT OF INDIA FINANCE DEPARTMENT New Delhi, the 1st August, 1945. OFFICE MEMORANDUM Subject : - Liberalisation of the conditions of service of temporary Government servants employed in civil Departments of the Government of India. The undersigned is directed to state that on a careful review of the conditions of service of temporary Government servants employed in civil Departments of the Govermient of India, particularly as regards leave and passage, the Governor General in Council has been pleased to decide that the concessions mentioned below may be granted as a war-time measure, the terms of any existing contract being varied where necessary in accord ance with these instructions : - A. LEAVE. (1) Officers whose services have been requisitioned under the provisions of the National Service (European British Subjects) Act, 1940, or the National Service (Technical Personnel) Ordinance, 1940, are, under the existing rules and orders, already entitled to conditions of service which are generally not less favourable than those admissible in the previous employment. Officers not covered by the above Ordinance or Act will, if they are employed in gazetted posts, or posts involving high technical qualifications, directly after relinquishing their employment in a commercial house or semi-government organisation, or directly after service in the armed forces for which they were released by their commercial or semi -government employers, be entitled to a credit of the full-pay leave due to them in respect of their previous service, subject to a maximum linlt of six months. This credit will be available to the extent that the leave on medical certificate or leave outside India, Burma, Ceylon, Nepal and Aden, applied for by the officer while in Government service, is in excess of the earned leave due to bin. The administrative Department of the Government of India concerned should, for the ourpose of this concession, certify whether a post held by an officer of this class involves high technical qualifications. Adjustments in respects of the carry-over of the leave earned by previous service, under a commercial or semi-government employer, (including the recalculation of leave salary on account of leave already taken) will be made in all cases where an officer at present serving in a civil Department has been appointed without a break to the post of the nature mentioned above after relinquishing a commercial or semi-government appointment. In addition to the previous leave carried over as above, officers of this class will be entitled to earned leave as for permanent Government servants subject to the Revised eave Pules, 1933. The additional credit which will result from the earning of leave at this enhanced rate will be calculated from the beginning of service, adjustments being made on account of leave salary in respect of any period of leave already taken. The concessions in the above paragraphs are not open to &gt; pi ? ^1^9 .•• non-gazettednon-frazetted ministerial Government servants. They will also be inadmissible to officers whose previous service under the corworcial or semi-government employer was definitely terminated before they accepted employment under the Crown, and to officers who, having been granted emergency commissions in the Armed Forces, have since been transferred to civil employment but continue to hold such co/TiiulGoions• f # 100 will, aoply to the latter category of officers). These concessions will, furthermore, be inadmissible to employees of the telephone corrparies at Bombay, Calcutta and i adras, who have been taken into Government service under conditions of service which were fixed ad hoc. For the purposes of the cdjncessions mentioned in these orders, a semi-government organisation will be deemed to be any orga/nlsation administered by a body which is controlled by Government whether in regard to proceedings generally or to specific matters, such as the sanctioning of its budgets, sanction to the creati n or filling up of particular posts, or the enactment of leave, position or si/nilar rules. (2) Officers recruited on contract, other than those governed by paragraph (1) above, to whom the ^odel Leave Terms in Appendix 10 to the Posts and Telegraphs Compilation of the Fundamental Rules and Supplementary Rules, have been applied or would be applicable, will, in modification of those terms, be entitled to the fallowing concessions.

(3) Officers other than those governed by paragraph (1) above, whose contract is for more than one year but not more than five years, and to whom the Model Leave Terms in Appendix 10-A to the Posts and Telegraphs Compilation of the Fundamental Rules and Supplementary Rules have been applied or woul^ be applicable, wi:1 be entitled in modification of those terms (1) to earned leave at 1/22nd of the period spent on duty (il) to leave on medical certificate for not more'than four months the leave salary in respect of 3uch leave being governed by the present ruies, and (ill) in special cases when n^ other leave is admlssibje, to extraordinary leave without pay to a r iaximun eriod of three months. The leave in item (1) of this paragraph will not be subject to any limit on accumulation. The medical leave in item (11) will be admissible only when the earned leave at the credit of the officer has first been exhausted. (4) As an alternative to the carry-over of the previous leave earned in respect of service under a Commercial or semi- government employer, or the leave on medical certificate mentioned in paragraphs (2) and (3) above, the officer concerned may elect to earn (in addition to the leave on average pay or earned leave which is otherwise due to him) additional leave on average pay or earned leave, as the case may be, at l/22nd of the period spent on duty. This additional leave will be admissible in India only on medical certificate, but may be taken with or without medical certificate outside India, Burma, Ceylon, NepsTL and Aden.

(7) Officers employed in and under the Department of Supply will be entitled to leave in accordance with the terms and conditions set out above. The orders contained in the Government of India, Supply Department (Main Secretariat) Office Memorandum No. F.13(12), dated the 3rd March, 1943, read with the subsequent amending and supplementary orders, are hereby cancelled•• B.

OF?IC?, MEMORANDUM 3-abJect t Grant of leave on medical certificate to temporary Government servants subject to the Revised Leave Rules, 1933. A case has been brought to the notice of this Department in which the implications regarding the leave- salary charges admissible to temporary Government servants, subject to the Revised Leave Rules, 1933, while on leave on medical certificate were not understood correctly and in order to remove similar misapprehensions it has been found necessary to clarify the position for the guidance of all concerned. According ly, the undersigned is directed to say that leave salary, during leave on medical certificate granted under rule 14 - A of the Revised Leave Rules, 1933, should, as indicatod in rule 16(2) of those rules, be based on half average pay and not on half pay. Past cases in which leave salary equal to half pay was allowed should not be re-opened. 2, p eriods of leave, including extraordinary leave, should not, for the purpose of the expressions 'one year's continuous service' and 'for every completed year of •••• service' used in rule 14 - A of the Revised Leave Rules, 1933, be treated as constituting a break in service. Such periods should therefore, be taken into account in determining the amount of leave on medical certificate. Sd. A. Hamid.

OFFICE :-^-.Or:ANDUM SUBJECT : Officiating appointments for S * short periods, n The undersigned is directed to invite a reference to this Department's Office Memorandum No. F.16(3)-Ex,I/38, dated the 22nd March, 1938 (copy enclosed), in which departments were requested not to fill short vacancies as a matter of course. In recent years there has been a very large increase in the number of posts under Government and consequently in the number of officiating vacancies. Where these vacancies are of short duration it is usual to fill them by promotion. There is however no doubt that officials appointed in these vacancies have not in all cases possessed the capacity or experience which would enable then to discharge the full duties of the post or to justify in full the drawing of the additional pay involved. 2. It is accordingly considered that post which falls vacant for a period of two months or less should ordinarily be held in abeyance; but an officer may be appointed to hold current charge of the routine duties of the post and may, in exceptional cases and with the concurrence of Finance Department, receive an addition to his normal pay for doing so. 3. Departments are requested to observe the principles contained in paragraph 1 of the Office Memorandum referred to above in dealing with all vacancies of two months or less. copy forwarded to all Chief Commissioners, etc. etc. etc Sd. 3.

The Government of India consider that there is also scope for economy and adwinistrative simplicity in the matter of raaking' officiating appointiiients for very short periods. Where a vacancy is for a period of fourteen days or less, it should be carefully considered whether it is really necessary to fill it, particularly if the filling of it involves a transfer. Possibly the current duties of the post could be attended to by some other officer on the spot, or possibly there will be no detriment to the public service if the post is simply not filled at all. It is recognised that for legal or technical or even administrative reasons, it may be necessary to fill short vacancies of even less than fourteen days, but the undersigned is directed to enjoin the exercise of a careful and deliberate discretion before vacancies of this duration are filled. 2. Vacancies extending from fourteen days to one month may require less strict treatment, but in these cases also the authorities charged with filling the vacancy should not fill it as a matter of course, but only if, in their opinion, it is advisable on public (as opposed to private) grounds to do so. 3. Short vacancies of longer than one month may normally be filled unless the authority concerned does not think it necessary to do so.

Ests., dated the 19th January, 1945, was in respect of the Secretary of State's 'services' only, the consequential grant of the concession of extended leave preparatory to retirement is also open only to members of the 'services' under the rule-making control of the Secretary of State and not to individual officers who are under his rule-making control but do not belong to those 'services'. The cases of the latter officers, if any, will be dealt with on the same basis as those of Class I officers under the rule-making control of the Governor General in Council, and will be referred for the orders of the Secretary of State on merits under Section 247(7) of the Government of India Act. 2. It has been decided that the case of an officer who is entitled to the concession mentioned in Note 2 below Article 466-A of the Civil Service Regulations, but has been persuaded to stay in active service for the period the ban on retirement continues without exercising that right, will be treated as if the officer had been compelled to stay for the period of active service in question. 3. The question has also been raised whether the concession mentioned in this Department letter dated the 15th June, 1945, is applicable to officers of the Government of India who before the date of their compulsory retirement are promoted either in an officiating or a substantive capacity to a Class I service or appointment* It has been decided by the Governor General in Council that no benefit under these orders may be allowed unless the officer concerned was a substantive holder of a Class I post or a member of a Class I service on the date of the orders imposing a ban, if any, on leave preparatory to retirement, or on a date at least 28 months earlier than the date of his compulsory retirement.

New Delhi, the 24th December, 1946, office ItEaiORANDUM^ SUBJECT t- Grant of leave to temporary Government servants on the termination of their posts. The undersigned is directed to state that the Governor General in Council has had under consideration for sometiae, the question whether any general instructions need be imposed on the grant of terminal leave to the temporary employees of the civil departments of the Government of India who have not been recruited on contract and whose services are terminated on their becoming surplus to the requirements of staff. As the grant of leave to temporary Government servants subject to the Revised Leave Rules, 1933, is not subject to the condi tions laid down in the proviso contained in the first sence of Supplementary Rule 285^ it is not tiecessary to extend the temporary posts to cover the period of the leave granted to the employees at the end of their temporary employment. The authorities competent to sanction leave have full discretion to grant earned leave (to the extent due) to a Goverment servant on the termination of his post. Where any period of notice is required to be given under the terms of employment of a temporary employee, the notice shouldpas far as possible be so given as to terminate with file end or a calender month * of service. If in the circumstances of any case, this is not 7 possible, such notice will run concurrently with the leave granted unless a specific provision to the contrary has been made. It is not considered necessary to impose any restrictions on taking up private employment or employment in an Indian State duringthis leave. C&amp;ses of re-employment by local funds as defined in Fundamental Rule 9(14) may also be permitted but a Government servant re^employed by such a Fund while on leave will have the option of drawing his re^employment pay or leave salary whichever is higher, but not both. 2. The above decision is not applicable in cases where the services of the temporary Government servant were lent by commercial concerns, Indian States or semi-Government orga nisations on terms which included the payment of a leave salary contribution or in cases where the benefit of carrying forward leave due under the commercial or semi-Government employer was permitted under special orders, vuch as those contained in the Government of India, Finance Department, office Memorandum No. F.12(23) -WII /46 dated the 1st August, 1945. The grant of leave on termination of the employment under Government will in such cases be at the cost and within the discretion o^the parent employer. 3. These orders are not applicable to re-employed pensioners apprentices and persons in the non-continuous employment of Government. Terminal leave will not also be admissiMe to a Government servant who has been dismissed for any fault of his own. 4. The rate of leave salary in respect of leave under these orders will be governed by Rule 16 of the Revised Leawe Rulesl93S 5.^ This office memorandum will have effect from the date of issue. The intention is that only persons recruited for tempo rary employment before this date may be granted leave according to these terms. No adjustments are intended to be made in respec of leave to persons whose employment has already been termi- ^ nated before this date. CP, to 11 ^ aort. or InaJ ..To.

The Government of India have considered the question of securing a clearance of the outstanding items, ih : consultation with the' Auditor General, and have come to the conclusion that the procedure already agreed to between the Provincial and Central Governments for the adjustment of March transactions relating to issues of stores etc. during the period of war (upto and for 31st March 1946). This adjustment should.be carried out in the accounts for the year 1945-46.

Office Memorandum No»D*12345-F/41 dated the 6th January 1942 m which 1 was stated that in respect of, interdepartmental transactions where the supplying department and tie department served happen to be in two di- fferent account circles, the proctdure for adjustment m advance 01 acceptance of debit by the departments served prescribed in paragraph 2 of this Deptt. Office Memorandum No.D.GQSO-t i r &gt;/o9, aated the ^Ist J^ne 1940, should be adopted permanently, in respect of transactions -for the month of March only. It has now been decided, in consultation with the Auditor General, that in order to secure an early settlement, i,he principle underlying the March procedure should be applied to all out standing items of issues of stores and of services rendered during the period of the war by one department of the Government of India^to another and that the adjustment in the accounts should be^carried out on the basis of the available Copies of Issue Vouchers and not held, over for want of the receipted copies thereof. These adjustments should be carried out in the accounts for the year 1945-46• 2. The undersigned is to stress the responsibility of +he receiyirig ^ department concerned under the relaxed scheme to ensure that the debit raised against it is correct, and in case of doubt to settle the matter in consultation with th^ Accounts Officer of- the supplying department, and to complete such settlements before the accounts for the year 1945-46 are finally closed. The latter requirement is particularly ^important as there will, otherwise, be a risk of budget provision being exceeded on-account of wrong debits having been raised. (The Accounts Office the receiving department will only exercise a percentage check the receipted vouchers received in his office for record with the adjust ments already made in his accounts)• 3. The Accounts Officer of the supplying department will prepare in duplicate and separately for each receiving department a statement in the form enclosed in support of the debits, and forward it along -ith the unreceipted copies of vouchers to the.Accounts Oj .ficer of e receiving department, who, on receiving the two copies will retain one in his own office and send the ocl er to the receiving department, stating that the adjustment has been finally made in order to enable it to indentify the debit.

G.. -■ Copy of Office Memorandum No, F.7 (3 )-E.11/46, dated the 26th September, 1946, from tho Finance Department of the Govern ment of India. Subject t Officiating appointments for short periods . — The undersigned is directed to invite a reference to Government of India, Finance Department, memorandum No. F.12(27)• 11/46, dated the 6th October, 1946&gt; regarding the restrictions on officiating appointments in vacancies for periods of two months or less, and to communicate the following observations to clarify certain points of doubt which have arisen in this connection : - (1) The administrative department of Government concerned has complete discretion to appoint an officer (a) to officiate fully in a vacant post; (b) to hold additional charge of the full duties of the post^ (c) to hold current charge of the routine duties of the post: or (d) to leave it vacant. Finance Department however attach considerable importance to the continued observance of the principles laid down in the office Memorandum under reference and hope that they will receive the fullest co-operation of departments in this respect. (2) In regard to the fixation of pay : (a) Fundamental Rule 31 (j^Lll apply when it is considered essential to make full officiating arrangements; (b) Fundamental Rule 49 will apply when an officer is appointed to hold additional charge of the full duties of the post. In this case the officer can draw the pay of the higher of the two posts and be granted additional pay which should not ordinarily . exceed one fifth of the pay of the lower post - vide paragraph 4 of Finance Department Office Memorandum No. F.16(11)-R.I/S1, dated the 2nd June, , x 1931. .VI (c) Where an officer is appointed to hold current charge of the routine duties of the higher post, he may be granted a special pay equal to 10 per cent of his substantive pay (excluding overseas pay). It should however not be necessary to make a formal appointment sanctioning the combination of posts and additional remuneration therefore in cases where the vacancy does not exceed 14 days. 2. Cases have come to the notice of the Finance Department in which leave for periods exceeding two months by a few days only has been sanctioned with a view to enabling officiating arrangements to be made. This amounts to the evasion of the principle underlying the issue of that office memorandum and it is requested that Departments will take steps to ensure that such evasions do not occur.

Sd/- Deputy Accountant General (Sr) Extract from the Government of India, Report of Expert committee No. lll(ii) on Miscellaneous Revenues. X XX X X XXX We recommend as a general rule and subject to the qualifi cations in the paragraphs that follow that (a) Receipts falling due after the 14th August 1947 be retained by the Dominion in whose jurisdiction they arise and (b) Receipts relating to the period ending the 14th August 47 but realised after that date be booked to the joint account of the present Government of India in accordance with the procedure separately recommended by the Committe on Budget and Accounts. 7. We do not know whether in respect of any institution it is proposed to have a joint administration on behalf of both the dominions. If any such arrangement is made, we presume the agreement between the two dominions will prescribe the extent to whcih the receipts of such institutions, if any, should be shared by the two dominions. 8. We now proceed to make a few observations on some O j . tne receipt heads which call for special comment. (a) Receipts from Irrigation Works ;- Receipts upto the 14th August 1947 should accrue to the present Central Government and there* after to the Government of the dominion in whose territory the work is situated. I ■ I | (b) Interest:- The amounts due in respect of the period prior to the 15th August 1947 should be credited to the combined account. Thereafter the dominion to which the outstanding loan or investment is allocated ia the aivision of assets and liabilities should receive the intei-Jt.(c) Ports and Pilotage . Receipts from the Major ports falling due after Separation will accrue to the dominion in which the port is situated. Fees from the Bengal Pilot service will accrue to the Indian Dominion if Calcutta is finally retained in that dominion L ighthouses and Lightships » ^ The receipts falling due after the 14th August '47 will accrue to th dominion in which the lighthouses are situated. (e) Aviation . The receipts mainly comprise license fees and landing fees if the fees cover a period of a full year we suggest that no re-adjust ment should be made in respect of the period after the 14th August T 47 Each dominion may retain whatever fee it collects after the partition. (f) Broadcasting . We suggest that broadcasting /fees etc. collected upto the 14th armty August, 1947 and booked in the joint account of the present Govt, need not be re-a^ocattd. Each collection made after the 14th Aug. f 47 should be retained by the dominion concerned. (g) Department of Industries and Supplies. We presume that there will not be any joint purchase organization after the partition. There will, therefore, be no question of allocating fees for purchase and Inspection, levied by the purchase organisation^ of the ywo dominions. The fixation of scales of fees if any are to be levied by each organisation for the purchases of the other dominion will be j&gt;^iatter for settlement between the two Governments. W Civil Works. The revenue is mainly on account of rents of buildingi receipts falling due after the partition will accrue to the dominion owning the buildings. (1) Receipts from Indian States . Most of the payments from Indian States wil. presumably cease with the lapse of paramountcy. If in future any receipt accrues from an Indian State an ad hoc agreement between the state and either of the cominions, the dominion entering into the agteeaent will retain the money. (j) Receipts in aid of Superannuation * The receipts will be retained by the dominion undertaking tne liability for the pension of the officer concerned. (k) Currency and Mint . The allocation of the surplus profits of the Reserve Barik'arid 'tHe profits from the circulationi of small coin will follow the arrangement recommended by the Expert Committee on currency af*d Coinage. Miscellaneous revenue from the Mint such as receipts from the d' vposal of scrap etc. will be retained by the dominion owning the mints. (1) Stationery and Printing . Each dominion will retain the misc«llaneouj revenues it collects by sale of paper, stationery etc. so far as the sales from the reserve stocks now maintained by the Controller of Printing and Stationery are concerned, we presume that these reserves will be taken into account in the division of assets and liabilities and that after the part ition there will be no common reserve, receipts from which will have to be shared between the two dominions. (m) Miscellaneous Revenue. It is impossible to lay down any criterion for the allocation of receipts and each item will have to be dealt with on its merits. Ordinary the dominion in whose jurisdiction the transactions occurs or to which it is related will retain the receipts. (n) Ex traordinary receipts» The current years budget provides for the estimated recovery from the Bahawalpur State on account of the U utlej valley project loan. It is expected that the State will completely liquidate its liability by the 31st March '49 and we suggest that the entire amount recovered from the State should be takne against the combined account of the Government of India. (o) The receipts mainly relate to the recoveries from Provincial Governments on account of over payments made to them under the scheme for sharing civil defence expenditure between the Centre and th^ Provinces and on account of the disposal of A.R.P. equipment and stores. We recommend that eyery effortshould be made to settle the accounts with the Provincial Government before the close of the current financial year so that all adjustments may be made against these amounts of the combined Government. As regards recoveries for stores we suggest that the receipts for supplies already made should be credited to the common account and that the disposal proceeds of s tores ^ e 3t .^ k ° a a ^ a iiocated® e ^^ should be made to the Government to who® the stocHo. 3773 -65 /58 .

In the present emergency Government servants are frequently required to travel in India on duty by air, and the number of cases of officers proceeding by air on Jix deputation outside India has also increased. The Govern ment of India have had under consideration the question to what extent compensation should be granted to an officer or his dependants in.the event of his receiving an injury or being killed as a result of an accident, while travelling on duty by air. It has bten decided that, as a temporary measure and for th^ duration of the war, the case of each such officer will be regulated by the provisions of the relavant extraordinary pension rules, for the time being in force, governing disability or family pension, as the case may k* be. Officers who are frequently requiced to travel by air for the necessary performance of their duties should obtain the general orders of Government. In other cases permission to xaa cover individual journeys should be obtained in advance from the head of the department or, where the officer is himself the head of a department, from Government. 2. In this connection the Government of India have also considered carefully proposals to reimburse to the officer additional premia paid by him to cover any such risk or to make good the difference between the sum x assured and what the officer on his estate would actually get from the Insurance Company if not extra premium had been paid by t:.e Officer for the special risk undertaken. They have come to the conclusion that there is no justification for the grant of this concession in addition to that admissible as a temporary -measure under the relevant extraordinary pension rules as a result of the decision communicated in paragraph 1 above.
