She sits face forward, looking towards the camera.The woman is dressed in white hijab, which covers her from head to foot. Her head piece is particularly wide and is shaped like an inverse-boat. On her feet she wears embellished slippers and she appears to be holding a printed cloth or handkerchief in her left hand.The negative has had hand-work applied, causing it to take on a soft-shaded quality in places. In particular, the background has been substituted completely, and the ground to the right of her leg seems to be entirely reinscribed.Temporal Context:The photograph was taken between 7 and 17 November 1884, according to Durkje van der Wal in his publication Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje: The First Western Photographer in Mecca, 1884-1885, Amsterdam : Manfred &amp; Hanna Heiting Fund, Rijksmuseum, 2011, p. 36. This attribution is based on unpublished diaries and correspondence in the Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje Archive, University of Leiden Library.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XIXPrinted beneath image, in ink:‘Pilgerin aus Banten (Java).’A circular 'British Museum' blind stamp is located in the right left corner.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Portrait photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x000044#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
