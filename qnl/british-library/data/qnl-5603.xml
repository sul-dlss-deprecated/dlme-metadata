Hickin- hotham, , Political Agent, Kuwait* f i a : ^ Eeference to our discussion of 30th Aprils 1!942, I wish to inform Your Excellency that as my country needs some improvements and owing to the modern urgent necessities, I decided to increase the Customs Duty charged on hoth the import and export to and from Kuwait, from Ff to as from 25th November, 1941. The real reason for this increase of duty is to use the extra charge for the betterment of Health and Educational Institutions, This simple duty is enforced equally on all merchants exporting and importing, both those reside in Kuwait and those living abroad and have trade communication with Kuwait, except some private goods imported by some prominent Britishers living in this country. I am very glad to inform Your Excellency that Health and Educational Institutions are offering their services free to all people residing in Kuwait, whatever their nationality may be. It is therefore, necessary that foreign merchants should not receive a special treatment which will distinguish them from Kuwaitis and which will mean ineauity in respect of the public. I am ouite certain that His Majesty’s Government will agree to this and will not ask any exemption to her sub jects from this rule, in order to protect her friend’s rights, especially as we witness how she encourages and helps the charity schemes whenever she gets the chance to do so. I hope that Your Excellency will communicate with the authorities concerned informing them the real reason for the increase of duty and I believe that this step will meet with the approval of His Majesty’s Government and the Hon’ble the Political E e sident and Your Excellency^ as well.8 Bet. 5992/42. 7 u-c (CL f&gt;.

He is instructing the Political Agent accordingly* , 1* (2) He considers that to insist on a time limit for the application of 'the increased duty to British subjects would, only serve to irritate the Shaikh; and that it will suffice if the latter tiov&amp;A be persuaded to agree that in accordance with previous practice no further increase in duty should be applied to British subjects without the consent of H.M.G* The suggestion for a time limit had its origin in the second paragraph of Foreign Office letter of Septenber 1st at Ext*4736/2*2. It was only put forward tentatively, both by the Foreign Office to us and by us to the Political Resident. I nV we may readily acquiesce in its abandonment. 2* The Political Resident does not consider it necessary to make a King's Regulation applying the increased duty to British subjects; but he is instructing the Political Agent, if the latter considers/considers that it will strengthen our position, to issue a notice, on the lines of that flagged at PZ« 202^4*5, stating slurply that the increased rate of duty will apply to *11 goods imported by British subjects.

V ' *Gt°® ..Please see submission at Ext.3995/42 and the Foreign Office letter of September 1st. The last paragraph of this letter is not very clear, but Mr. Eyres lias explained to me that (.aj The 'general rule” to whi’ch he refers is one applicable to all territories where H.M. exercises foreign jurisdiction in the same way as at Koweit; (b) By 'Treaty' he means Article 10 of idle Bandar Shuwaikh agreement. (l can find no relevant provision in Aitchison.) Article 83 (b) of the Koweit Order in Council 1935 (flagged in the attached compilation) seems to provide the necessary authority for the making of a King's Regulation for the purpose in question. On the other hand, I am not sure whether the Foreign Office are right in their contention that the new concession is 'outside the Treaty”; since the latter part of Article 10 provides for the imposition upon British subjects of Oustoms Duty in excess of 2$ j-f the consent of H.M.G-. is obtained. And we do not 7 /ant to do anything which might imply that we do not still regard this article as in force. I I feel inclined simply to suggest to the Political Resident, v/ithout going into the pros and cons of the matter, that he may consider it appropriate to make a King's Regulation for the purpose. Do you concur in the revised drai*t below?I have some doubt nyself whether it is reality advisable to mention aching atout the iuestion of the _ operation of the xelerant clauses the 1 ?° 7 . er as to Which our present attitude,! sather,xsthatwe prefer to consider those clauses still i* fore®.

But the new concession being outside the Treaty, the issue in the present case of a King’s Regulation which could be repealed later might make the position clearer. This is a point on which perhaps the Political Resident’s view might be taken and followed.

It was again made clear in 1934 that this increase was not to be levied on gpods imported by British subjects (see PZ. 1701/34, flagged, and PZ. 3603/34 whicn is iust above it}. fUc 3 # These and subsequent increases in the Koweit import duty / and the extent to which the latter have been applied to British subjects, are described in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Political Resident ‘ s letter below. It will be seen that the latest increase - from 5i to per cent, is being applied equally to B&lt;u£teh and Koweit subjects; and that the Sheikh, after discussing the question with the Political Agent, has formally asked for the agreement of to the continuance of this position. Unfortunately the translation of the Sheikh's letter, which should have been enclosed in the Political Resident's letter, has not reached us. 4. The Political Resident reports that, according to the Political Agent, the Sheikh is in considerable doubt as to the extent to which he is still bound by any of the clauses of the 190? agreement. Tkt suggests that at some more appropriate time it would be very desirable to incorporate in a new agreement so much of their, provisions as it may be deemed necessary to retain. At the moment however we need only consider what reply should be made to the Sheikh's letter. On this the Political Resident outlines in paragraph 6 of his letter two possible courses, of which he recommends the second, viz. that the Sheikh's request should be granted, subject to his formal acceptance of the condition that in accordance with previous practice no further increase in duty should be applied to British subjects without the consent of 5* The following considerations in support of the Political Resident's recommendation may be gleaned from his letter. The total increase to which British subjects would be liable, viz. from 4 to per cent v is a small one; and part of it is intended to provide funds for the education and medical services of thfc# State. There are3. 17 very few British subjects doing business at Kov/eit and they are likely to be as willing as not to pay the extra duty in order to avoid getting into disfavour with the local authorities and with merchants of other nationalities, The Political Resident even suggests that our refusal to accede to the Sheikh's request might be used as propaganda by the enemy. Paragraph 7 of his letter shows that our compliance should have no awkward repercussions on the position of British subjects in Bahrein and Muscat. 6 # In these circumstances it is proposed that the Secretary of State should approve the Political Resident's recommendation; and a draft telegram (in accordance with his request) in this sense is submitted. The draft suggests that he may think it desirable to add that this agreement is without prejudice to the question whether any part of the agreement of 1907 is still in force. This addition is, of course, not strictly necessary, since clause 10 envisages the possibility of H.U.G.'s giving their approval to the levy on British subjects of duty in excess of 4 per cent. e &gt;- o 4 iif.- tiii'. ifv .

Hay, C.I.E., Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London. CUSTOMS DUTY AT KUWAI 1. Sir, I have the honour to state that it was reported in the Kuwait intelligence Summary for the second half of Novemher 1941 that from the 23rd November the Kuwait Customs import duty had been increased from 5*£$ to ad valorem in order to provide additional funds for the jEducation and Medical Departments, itjwas stated that the increase did not affect British subjects, in a subseguent Summary however viz. that for the first half of February * ■ - V „ _ ,, . it was stated that the increase applied egually to British and Kuwait subjects. 2. As soon as this came to my notice I pointed out to the Political Agent that the application of this increase of duty to British subjects was against the terms of clause 10 of the Bandar Shuwaikh Agreement of 1907, which clause was still regarded as being in force in spite of the termination of the lease, and asked him to ensure that the increase was not applied to British subjects. The upshot of conversations between the Political Agent and the Shaikh on the subject is that the latter has written a letter asking that in the circumstances of the case His Majesty’s Government should agree to the increase being applied to British subjects. I enclose a tra nslation of S the letter in question. 2’. I “ 1 ^ ~ . ^ • i — f J 3. The Kuwait import duty was first increased from 4/* to 4£$ in 1931, on which occasion as the result of the / intervention f Nb intervention of the Political Agent who was acting under the instructions of the Political Besident the Shaikh promised that the extra if, would in no case he levied from British subjects. In 1934 the Government of India made enquiries al ' u '' this Particular increase in t heir letter No.D.556-H/54 dated the 19th February 1934 and were informed that it did not apply to goods imported by British subjects. The import duty was further raised to 5^ in 1936 vide paragraph IV(a) O x the Kuwai for that year, hut this increase again was not applied to British subjects, in 1940 the import duty was raised to vide paragraph 17(c) of the Kuwait Administrati on R eport for that year, hut it is not stated whether the increase was applied to British suhiects or not. 4. 1 enquired from the Political Agent whether British subjects have in fact been paying import duty in excess of 4^ or not and he has informed me that some of them T, have been paying the full amount of duty, up to 4$ as a legal import and the extra percentage as a voluntary contribution, presumably to obviate any cause of friction between them selves and their brother merchants T \ British subjects doing business in Kuwait are very few in number and I rather suspect that they have been payirg the extra duty for some considerable time either because they were not aware of the exemption to which they were entitled, or because the extra amount of duty was comparatively small and they did not wish to get themselves into disfavour with the local authorities by making a fuss over it. 5. The Political Agent reports that the Shaikh is in considerable doubt regarding the extent to which he is still bound by any of the clauses of the 1907 agreement. He certainly in 1931 acted as if he were still bound by clause 10, and I think in the present case if we were to insist he would agree to continue to observe the provisions of that clause. Clauses 5 and 9 and by implication clause 10 of the Agreement are regarded by His Majesty*s G-overnmer.t as being3 22 iDeing still operative cf. paragraph 6 of letter from the Foreign Office to the India Office No.E.3382/119/91 dated *( the 3rd SeptemlDer 1927 'but their continued validity is at ©u least Questionable and it would seem very desirable to ^ incorporate in some new agreement so much of their pro visions as it may be deemed necessary to retain. The present time however is clearly not suitable for initiating negotiations for such an agreement and it is necessary only to consider what reply should be sent to the Shaikh•s letter. 6. There appear to be two courses open; we can reply either (a) that we regret that in view of the undertaking given in 1907 we cannot agree to British subjects being charged import duty in excess of 4$, or (b) that in the special circumstances of the case we agree to British subjects paying the 6%# duty on condition that the Shaikh agrees that in accordance with previous practice no further increase in duty should be applied to British subjects without the consent of His Majesty’s G-overnment. In the latter case we should ask for a formal acceptance by the Shaikh of the condition imposed. 7. The position at Bahrain is that in accordance with Article 4 of the Treaty of 1861 British subjects cannot be called upon to pay duty of more than 5$ ad valorem on goods imported by them. In 1932 however with the consent of His Majesty’s Government the Bahrain Government increased the duty on certain luxuries to 10/ ad valorem and on alcohol to 15/ and these increases were made applicable to British subjects. There is here in any case no differentiation between British subjects and others as all alike pay 5/ import duty on articles other than those mentioned above. In Muscat under the Treaty of 1939 British subjects are only entitled to most favoured nation treatment, and they do in fact pay the same import duties as Muscat subjects.. i - 4 - 23 iho increase of import duty which the Shaikh of Kuwait now asks to he applied to British subjects is a small one - viz. from to 60, and part of this is specifically for beneficent objects, i am inclined to think that it would be invidious to refuse agreement and that such refusal would tend to make British traders unpopular with the Kuwait authorities and merchants and .a useful would also provide/propaganda for the enemy, i accordingly recommend that the Shaikh's request to be permitted to recover 60 duty on goods imported by British subjects should be concurred in on the condition stated in para graph 6. 9. I should be grateful for telegraphic instructions. 10, 1 3111 sen(iil « a copy of this letter to the Government of India.

The Shaikh was of course quite aware of the wording ° f Treaty and paragraph 10, even though to refresh his memory I showed him the English and Arabic version. ' 6 Place, the Shaikh pointed out that the wording of the treaty, as far as he understood it forbade him to raise the duty on goods exported from or imported into Kuwait by British subjects including British Indians. But that he was free to make an increase in the case of his own subjects should the state finances render this necessary, with this view I concur. : • Second ly the Shaikh assured me that although there were about a dozen Indians all told making a living in Kuwait, only one soda-water manufacturer^ imported anything into Kuwait, and very occasionally an Indian who runs a flour mill here. The others were all people of the barber, oculist and durssi type who imported or exported nothing. In spite of this however he the Shaikh had passed orders to the Director of Customs, that the extra tax was in no I case t0 be levied from British subjects. Re had done this the day the new tax was inaugurated, though he had not thought it worth mentioning to me. Captain J.R.L. Bradshaw, Secretary to the Hon r ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 6. /n - 2 - r the Shaikh wished to make it quite clear that the levying of the new tax of originated from the Kuwait merchants themselves, and was a sort of subscription to be taken from the rich of the town, to ease the lot of the many poor who today were finding it very hard to keep themselves alive, much less pay house tax. m other words the -well to do- had come forward and offered to bear the burden of the city House Tax, provided such house tax was abolished, and they considered that the easiest way of bringing this about was to ask the Shaikh to impose on themselves the merchantile community the small additional burden of over and above the reasonable import duty they already paid. Fourthly, and this replies to the question raised in your last paragraph. The Shaikh said that ever since he came to the throne the import duty levied on his subjects, and everyone else has been A%. It used to be 10% in M ubarak*s and Jabir^s time, (except on British subjects), but that Salim hoping to win the Kuwait 'ulema' favour (who all along had said that the ruler had no right to take more than 2j$ by Sheria Law) reduced the import tax to 4 ^. 1 ^E urR was agreed to by the TT ulema' because the leading merchants gave out that they would not accept in the interests of their State a lesser reduction. All politics of course, they having, as the Shaikh said, put the ulema up all along to work a reduction from the hated 10%. ®• I hope what I have said above will show that no infringement of the 1907 T way intended.
