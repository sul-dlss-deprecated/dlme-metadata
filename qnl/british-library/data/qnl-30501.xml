This department of the Muscat Municipality is still in existence, under the direction of Saiyid Abbas bin Peisal. 2. Anti-malarial measures, chiefly the oiling of wells and reservoirs and the filling-in of all unnecessary shallow wells are still being aone. That, there is some benefit from these measures, is seen in the decline in Malaria cases and also the decrease of mosquitoes as noticed and reported by the Public. However, the chief sources of breeding are the private houses and ’barrasties* of the inhabitants. Until and unless the owners do something to prevent breeding in their houses (where it is difficult for the P.H. Inspectors to enter) a certain amount of Malaria will 'always con-tinue. According to the survey lade at Muscat some years ago, the commonest Malaria- nosquito is the AHQPliILLES ivi/vGULAPEHlb ..,n lCii is essenuiallj' a house-breeder. So house-cleanliness is t. : e lost Lnportant problem, if A—M measures are to oe success—ui. 3. Two s-1 i r r up-pump s and a'supply of Pyre thrum Extract, for making a spmaying* solution^ were purchased by the Municipality durinp* the year. A system of spraying houses and huts is being carried out. This should destroy the adult mosquito and thus further lessen breeding, and will also destroy a certain number of flies, which are a menace in Muscat. t rm A septic-tank type of latrine school.

Besides customs duties, collections under the following heads are also made by the Customs Department:- I. Boat Registration fees. II. Brokerage contracts. III. Xi aka . IV. Quarantine fees. V. Sale of forms. VI. Bait-ul-Mal. The following notes n some interest: These contracts are given with a view to facilitate the collection of octroi tax on all articles imported from the interior. The contractor is given the right to collect the octroi tax in addition to his broxerage from the sellers. ^11 articles imported are collected at a market place appointed for this purpose and are later auctioned by the auctionei o appointed by the contractor. The contractor is under an obligation to pay to the sellers immediately after the auction, the saxe^ proceeds less octroi tax and his brokerage. Octroi tax is paid by the contractor to the customs department and he is allowed to retain his brokerage of 5% m return for a specified annual payment. Zakat or land revenue also constitutes one of the sources State's income. The entire coast tiwe of about 200 miles v/est of Muscat is cultivated with dates trees which form the largest gardens of date trees known in the world. Most of the tr~es uepen upon rain for their water supply whereas in some districts they draw their water supply from the FALAJS and welds. ^ Zakat is collected at where the irrigation is carriea on through wells and at 10% where Fa lads or natural outlets of water. For the purposes of Zakat, the Batinah coa't divided into the following districts 1. Sib. 2. Birka. 3. Musanah. 4. 3we iq • 5. Khaboora. 6. Saham. 7. Sahar. 3. Shumailia. No z&amp;kat is collected on the gardens between Birka and Khaboora presumably because the Government is not in a position to compel the Shaikhs of Yal-Sa'ad and Howasna to pay the Zakat.-3 14. id 16. 17 .

The Public Health Department of the Muscat municipality functioned during the year under the direction of Saiyyid Abba, bln Faisal. It's main and most Important activities were anti-malarial which it continued with a fair measure of success. According to a survey made at Muscat some years ago the commonest malarial mosquito is however the Anopheles Maculapenje which is essentially a house-breeder and it is inside the houses and huts that, owingI 9 5 'V - 2 - owing to the privacy-complex of the inhabitants, anti- malarial measures cannot be carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. As long as this attitude persists there is no hope of abolishing malaria. The Minicipallty now has two stirrup pumps and a supply of Pyre thrum Extract and sprays huts and houses* this ought to be effective in destroying the auuXt mosquito and may explain the partial diminution in the number of flies. (b) fgencv Hospital* The hospital was open throughout the year and was well attended. The following patients were treated:- } Outdoor department Indoor department Minor operations 17,888 136 176 The chief diseases were malaria, eye infections and venereal diseases. (c) Quarantine. During the year there was a virulent epidemic ot email pox on the Batinah coast and on the borders of Oman. A few cases were discovered in the town of Matrah, but these either came themselves or caught the iniaction from others from the coast towns. Three public vaccinators were engaged. One was stationed in Matrah where he vaccinated persons and also inspected arrivals into the town to prevent smallpox being brought in. The other two worked on the Batinah coast. A land quarantine station was established outside the village of Ruwai and wae used while the epidemic lasted The Quarantine Station at Haramil is in good repair and was used for a few cases. 3 . SE^ATIOM. (al* Tribal . There has been no major development in the tribal situation in Oman during the year. Grievances between tribes- 3 - r ' ^ V tribes or of a tribe against the s&amp;iscat Government have be%n aired in interminable series of discussions, arguments, agreements, breaches of agreements and then further negotia tions culminating sometimes in a single murder but more usually in what would be regarded in a settled country as petty crime to be dealt with by the ordinary police force. Only in a state where even small tribes assume to them selves some of the attributes of sovereign powers can such incidents be regarded as of political significance. The three important Sheikhs in Oman, Abdulla bin .fo harmed al Khalil i (“the Imam**), lea bin Saleh al Hart hi, and Sulaiman bin Hamiyar of the Jabal Akhdar have not been openly active though such is their power, it is probably correct to assume, that they have supplied the inspiration for most of the incidents which have taken place. They have Kept aloof from the l&amp;iscat Government which is equivalent to saying that they have not troubled it. The most likely reason for this is that our extension of air-power in the Sultan’s territory has not only convinced them of our willingness but also of our instant ability to support him. Also, the Sheikhs, owing to the diminution of food supplies from India have been, like everyone else, pre-occopied in the problem of how to feed their people. The Bedou regards rice with almost the awesome avidity of the Hindu for product© of the cow and the enforced reduction by the Muscat Government of supplies to Oman has been one of the «** most noteworthy developments of the year. That AliU carried through without more than an occasional protest/ is further testimony to the increased prestige of the Sultan, exercised, as it has been for the whole year, from the distant province of Dhofar. This last circumstance also explains the distant attitude of the three premier Sheikhs who would consider it undignified and, even more importantimportant* to tnem would certainly find it profitless to deal witn otiier tnan the head of the Muscat State* (t&gt;) ),ocal * tne posts of Finance Officer and Director-General of Customs were 9 in February&gt; amalgaaiated by the Sultan in the person of Khan Sahib Macjbul Hussain Khan who was formerly Finance Officer only. Hilal bin Hamad al Hawaii was appointed tfali of Quriyat in December* 4* XKADi^ (i) the following table shows the value of the total imports and exports during the year 1941-42 as compared with the previous year Year* imaortg^ gxp,ogt^ 1940— 41 Hs* 46j2B|9V7 ss« 30j22 1 170 1941- 42 te. 53,12,403 is* 38,68,298. fhe increase in the import figures represents an increase in the price of imports not in their Quantity which, in fact, decreased* The increase in the value of exports was mainly due to the high price obtained, for dates during the year* (ii) India took practically 80% of the exports and supplied the same percentage of the imports• (iii) Cereals and textiles were the main impoi'ts, dates and salted fish by far the most important exports. (iv) The Maria Theresa thaler, the local currency, appreciated steadily during the year reaching the hipest figure of 234 rupees for 1GU thalers in December. At the close of the year it had never reached lower than 145 rupees for 100 thalers* Prices of local products have all to be paid for in this currency and the poor, especially those on low rupee salaries have accordingly suffered. The thaler has a greater silver content than the• 5 - • ' the rupee ana t»he hoarding of silver is given as the main reason for its appreciation. (v) The price-control comittee functioned during the year and the hope expressed in the previous report that it would prevent the worst forme of profiteering, has been fulfilled. It became evident, however, that to function fsirly, rationing would have to be combined with price-control. This is however, a consummation never likely to be achieved in fluacat. (vi) i'*eli-establiahed merchants with capital behind them made good profits during the year, but some smaller men carrying on business on borrowed money suffered badly when the time came for thorn to repay thaler loans raised when it was cheap in relation to the rupee, xnere weie, however, no really large failures. S. THE SCUTHSBN ARABIA AXP-RQfflS- (i) The development of the three Muscat aerodromes on this route was the most important of the year. At it's beginning they were practically unusable by high-performance aircraft $ at it*s end they were the halting places for as many as eighty American “Liberators' per week and were being used as well by operational aircraft of the R.A.F., while the buildings for their ground staffs and garrisons had been completed. Started as an alternative to the •Iraq route at a time when it seemed possible that the Axis forces might close it, the Southern Arabxa xoute is now an important subsidiary. The Civil Aviation Department, | India were responsible for its construction until in July they gave over to the authorities noted oelow. (ii) Salalah . After some initial difficulties concerning the agency by whom the work was to be carried out and with , the local labour, work here proceeded smoothly. The Sultan*s prescene© and his continuous willingness to ensure® ns ora titai liioour suppliea oy him gives a foil return for value received j ensured this 5 on the other hand bis all pervasive insistence that the activities of everyone in Salalah, even in the smallest matters, must receive his placet^ kept the Assistant Political Agent constantly engaged, in his successful ©ndoavours to secure it for the manifold Br5.tish and American operations. What cannot he otherwise described than the PsekA merican Airways invasion of Salalah in the B'mmr of the year temporarily shocked the Sultan not only by it*© method hut because of the somewhat wild behaviour of the representatives of the Company who were, without his consent, stationed at Sslalah. This impression has? at least been partially erauicated and, it Is hoped, wholly compersated for by the conclusion with His Highness of s regular agreement for the use of his aerodromes by the U.S. Army Air Corps, fan-American Airways no longer operate on the route* The K.A.F. at S&amp;lalah are commanded from Aden, the U.S. Ar**y Air Transport Corps from Lagos. The ifewar State infantry are stationed at the aerodrome for its defence and works are the responsibility of the Air Ministry P.w.D. operating from Aden. (ili) Vnslrah . The aerodrome at aSasirsh Island is tta best of the three and the worst situated* The island has no governmental organisation, no anchorages, and no water. The combination of the first two defects and the apparent inability of anyone concerned to provide proper unloading facilities allied with their conviction that the local Bedouin uncontrolled by anyor.c could be re lie... upon to unload their material and not to steal it, led to a state of affairs which culminated in a minor crisis when ever a ship arrived at Masirah, The Bedou refused to unload until promised payment of fantactic a urns $ then he made~ 7 - 8 hG the inefficient means of unloading — araali sailing ■boats —* more inefficient by delays ?.nd objections tc loads. When rsmonstrated with he etrack for mere money. When the cargoes were got ashore it was often found that they had been pilfered* while any attempt to guard them during unloading was also met by a etriko. Again and again this performance was repeated end reported upon till by the end of the yenr it was evident that it would have to be stopped. By that time there was practically a whole squadron of the Royal Air Force at Masirah* a detachment of U.S.A.A.T.C. and a flying-boat base at Umm Rases twelve miles from the land aerodrome. Reconnaissance and other operational flights were being carried out from the island. ( 144 .) Has al E&amp;dd . To make an aerodrome hero bitumen mats had to be laid in tho sand for lengths of 1000 yards in to the prevailing winds. They, with the aerodrome subsidiary buildings wera completed and being used in . October. The Fh A.F. at yasirah and Has al Hadd are under the Iraq Command. Guarding of stores at the aerodromes was first in the charge of the Auxiliary Pioneer Battalion who were removed when the defence of the aerodromes was given over to tha B.A.P. (Persian Gulf) Levies all of whom at Has al Hadd and Masirah had been raised at Gwad.ur, 6 . FRENCH INTljR^CTC. The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. 7 . MISSIONARY WORK * The work of the American South Arabian Mission continued in the charge of the Rev. and Mrs. Dykstra while Dr. W.W. Thoms carried on the medical side of the mission at Matrah with the help of his assistant.Thirty-nine slaves applied for manumission c^rtif-U&amp;WS during the year and thirty-seven ware ’manu mit ted, Of the thirty-nine applicants thirty were domestic elavsa and the remainder were captured slaves* m&amp;nm* The total rainfall during the year was *52 inches. The wcathsr in i?ay and June was up to Muscat’s worst stand ax'd but after that it relented and the nights were frequently relieved by traces of the South-West monsoon breezes*10 - (§) (f) 11 Mr. T.F.T. A1 Sa«ad rt * He remained in India during the year. (g) Sayyid Fahr bin Tatnair. He remained at the Mayo College Ajmere for the year. (h) Sawid Dhiyab bin Fahad bin Turki . Nothing has been heard of this gentleman. II. MUNICIPALITY . The work of the Municipality during the year has been confined practically entirely to petty repairs of building© and road© and to clearing and cleaning. This i© partially explained by the fact that its budget has remained constant while price© of all building materials have risen. Due to other more immediate pre-occupations it has not been possible to spare this department the time needed to give it the encouragement it was last noted as continually requiring. III. EDUCATION * The primary school still under the headmastershlp of Anwar Effendi at-Tamini has continued to do good work. IV. GKKEKAL CQIMNICATI0M &gt; (i) Cable . Cable and Wireless Limited brought a new cable into Mdse at on May 24th connecting with Aden and working with that station on the 30th May* The installa tion of apparatu# in connection with this and the general Increase in the carrying capacity of the Gulf system necessitated an addition of eleven men to the Company’s staff and the building of accommodation for the new equipment• The Muscat-Karachi cable was interrupted for a short period in January and the Muse at-Bahrain cable in January and November. Messages were sent by wireless telegraphy. (ii) Wireless . Communication with the Sultan’s station at- 11 - at Salalah thz*cu^Ii Cable &amp; Wireless Limited w&amp;s discontinued from the 29th August owing to it f s breakdown. It was however always possible to comunicate with Salalah through the R.A.F. or British Overseas Airways Corporation systems. V. TRANSPORT . External . The regular British India Steam Navigation Company steamers ceased to call at Muscat during the year owing to the demands made on them for war purposes and their place was taken by irregular calls of ships mostly chartered by the B.I. company fi^om companies formerly operating on the Chinese coast* In all 72 steamers taking passengers said freight called during the year but as it drew to it l s close their visits became more infrequent, and regular transport to and from Muscat and the outside world ceased. As a result dependence on dhow transport has increased with profitable results for their owners. internal . The number of motor taxis available in Muscat and Matrah became fewer during the year as one old car after another went unserviceable for want of spare parts, batter ies and tyres. Motor transport on the Batinah coast is no longer to be obtained. vi. Efiy«cg. The strength of the force remained as in the previous year. Despite the fact that it has remained under the control of the ineffective Inspector, Mohammad Jawad Darwesh its discipline has remained surprisingly good, mainly due to the Kavildar seconded from the Muscat Infantry. (ii) Like the Muscat Infantry the Police contains many Bilochis whose real home is in Mekran. Some of them deserted while on leave and, though measures were taken to prevent them doing so, got themselves enlisted in the R.A.F. Levies being raised at Gwadur. The pay with free rationsSt**'12 - ration© offered by the levies is better than that given by the Police* (iii) An increase of pay from hs* 20/- to rss*22/- per mensem (without rations) was allowed by the Sultan for police constables. There has been a demand for a further increase. (iv) Recruitment was carried out under the same system as previously, by taking volunteers from the Muscat Infantry. It would seem that in view of the better emolu ments (infra) now granted to that force volunteers are, in future unlikely to be forthcoming and men will have to be recruited direct and trained specially for police duties. (v) Clothing ana equipment are supplied to the police on payment from the Muscat Infantry. The delays in obtaining supplies from India have affected tea police even more adversely than the Infantry. VII. DEFENCE.., (1) Major L.B. Hirst, 10th Gurkhas took over from Major A.O.C. Pettyfer as Military Adviser to the Muscat Government on the 7th February. (ii) Muscat Defences * The condition of the Town wall is good. The question of ‘facing* the wall, as originally suggested, was discarded as being an unnecessary expense. Frequent inspection gives no indication of deterioration. A cement top Is being put on to prevent seepage. The surrounding towers of the town can in case of necessity all be defended but the “Sangars” which have been constructed are of far more value as they are practically invisible except at close range. Mirani Fort has been completed and is in an excellent state of repair. The aerodrome is now completely covered from four underground and camouflaged dug-outs, with roofs of a minimum thickness of eight feet which should be prool against anything other than a direct hit. They are specially— 13 ~ Bp ac I ally constructed, to take me alum machine guns* A line of sunken and camouflaged emplacevents has been constructed between the landing giound. and the Fort in the dual role of protecting either the Fort or landing ground in the event of dive-bombing* For the defence of Muscat and Mat rail from Oman, a line of hangars is being constructed from Ruwi to the sea and this will cover all approaches to Matrah, the approaches to Muscat being already covered. Forward gun positions have been made for the artillery as the guns have insufficient 'crest clearance 1 to bring fire to bear in the Wataiya area from Bait -al-Falaij • (iii) Batinah Coast * The ic^ortant forts from a defensive point of view are in a sufficiently good state of repair to be defended in case of attack by a tribal enemy. (lv) Launch * This has done excellent work and given no trouble. She has done two trips up the Batinah and several patrols as well as numerous trips to Has al Hadci on behalf of the Political Agent. Her armament has been increased ( by one additional medium machine gun* (v) Wireless . All the transmitters and seven generators ordered from England early in the year were received very badly damaged ana only one transmitter and two generators were able to be put into working order* Another has now been made ready and is to be sent to bhofar • It Is unlikely that the remaining can be repaired before the end of the War. Communication with Dhofar was maintained for a short period but was not satisfactory. Even with powerful sets, wireless telegraphy communication between Muscat and Dhofar is very difficult during the monsoon period. (vi) Muscat Infantry* (1) Strength * The Force remained up to strength throughoutn -14- throughout the year with the exception of a short period during which there was a 'strike” for increased pay as a result of which 119 men were discharged. At present ten more recruits are required to bring the force up to strength The type of man now being enlisted is very much better than the majority of those discharged. Jemadar Ahmed Sher has replaced Subedar Mir Bey Khan, and although not such an expert in gunnery, he is a signalling instructor and has already made a great improvement in the standard of signalling. A number of the signallers can now send and read up to the standard Indian Army rate. (2) Training . Individual and collective training has been carried out together with frequent exercises. It has been found that owing to the very low standard of education and mentality generally it is a waste of time to teach the men too many new methods as they cannot absorb them. They are being given a thorough traning in the more simple methods. Sand table schemes and lectures were attempted but were discarded in favour of outdoor practice a© they meant nothing to the ff.C.O.s and men. The main lectures now consist of general lectures on the war situation, mostly with a view to the men understand that although Muscat is not at war she is bound to be aiieeted by it. The Recruit Training Period ha© been reduced from 21 weeks to 12 . (3) Artillery . Rigid economy has been exercised in the expenditure of ammunition owing to the difficulties of obtaining fresh supplies. The practices that have been carried out with live ammunition have produced excellent results. The camels maintained for the transport of the guns, are being done away with and in future will be carried- 15 - i ■ ■ carried on M.?« This has been done mainly owing to the fact that saddlery is unobtainable. (4) Machine Guns . The training of the gunners is good and the results on Field Firing excellent. (5) Weapon Trainim . The course has been reduced as much as possible without losing efficiency in order to save ammunition. Results have been good. All men, other than recruits,have carried out anti-aircraft and grenade training* All officers and men armed with the pistol have fired the annual course laid down for the Indian Army. ( 6 ) Equipment and Clothing . Equipment is in good condition. Due to the delays in receiving supplies from India the clothing situation became so critical that it was difficult to find sufficient uniforms to drees the ordinary guards. (7) Motor Transport . The four 30-cwt. Chevrolet lorries have given excellent service but a complete overhaul has now to be taken in hand. ( 8 ) Medical . The health of the force has, on the whole been good. There have been very few cases of malaria. There was an outbreak of smallpox which fortun ately died out rapidly; it was, however, responsible for the only death which has occurred this year. ($) Rations . Due to the general difficulty of obtaining food supplies from India and to high prices it became impossible during the year for the Infantry to supply rations to its men. Instead their pay was increased to their great discontent. The Military Adviser then took up the question with the Sultan who sanctioned the supply of a very good ration since when there has been no further difficulty. (10) Sports . Hockey and Basket Ball tournaments have been held. The annual sports were cancelled, on medical advice, due to a sudden and unexpected period ofof excessively hot weather* Physical training is carried out three days a week by all ranks and daily by recruits* (11) aulldir^a . (i) Minor repairs have been carried out on the Fort which is in excellent condition apart from the wooden verandahs• (ii) Minor repairs to the hospital (iii) Five V»C*0.s quarters have now been completed; the work is of surprisingly high standard and was done by the Infantry*s own pioneers. vui* The total revenue for the year 1942 amounted to &amp;*8,79,356/11/- against Rs.7,00,000 estimated and expendi ture to &amp; • 6,42,769/14/- against Ite *6,56,800 estimated, leaving a nett balance of as *2,36,686/13/- on the year's working* To this must be added the sum of Re *126,326/8/- the profit made by the State due to the appreciation of the dollar and the balsa* ix. mm.MA.ims.

There were no other infectious diseases. III. POLITICAL SITUATION . (a) i ra ufl. Fight between the people of Ib ri and Bcni.ahafir. In an affray, in April 1943, between the people of Ibri and the Beni Ghafir, casualties ©mounted to 67 killed and 26 wounded, the Beni Ghafir having considerably the better of the exchanges. Amongst the killed were the eon and the nephew ol the Sheikh of Hamran and Ahmed bin Said, brother of the Qadhi of Sohar. The cause of the trouble was a series of petty thefts committed by each side against the other. The dispute was finally settled by th© mediation of Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim, Minister for Internal Affairs, and Sheikh Sulaiman of the Jebel Akhdar. In early January the tribal leaders assembled at Qabail to discuss the restrictions imposed by the Muscat Government on the export of rice from Muscat to Oman. The meeting decided that Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Karthi should represent the grievances of the tribesmen to the Muscat Government and, if these were not removed, the Treaty of Sib, 1920, should be denounced. Actually, Sheikh Mohammad bin Isa came to Muscat on his father’s behalf and the negotiations ended satisfactorily It was recognised that the lack of rice was not the fault of the Muscat Government and a tribal agent was appointed to Muscat to purchase the Omanis* share of wheat and barley. In June 1943, Saiyid Mohammed bin Hilal, «aii of and the last relative of the Muscat Ruling Family remaining irTan official position in tribal territory, was dismissed by the Imam* (b; I Ha of Wall of Bpshar.

The Wall of Birka, Saiyid Mahmud bin Muhammad bln Turk!, uncle of the Sultan, was dismissed from his post in May 1943. The complaints against him were mainly of peculation and a committee was appointed to look into them. By the end of the year, no decision had been reached and it seemed fairly obvious to the ordinary observer that Saiyid Mahmud was under no apprehension that he would ever be required to refund his ill-gotten spoils. . Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, the Chief Qadhi of Muscat died on the 19th May from cerebral malaria. He was succeeded by Shaikh Saif bin Hamad Alaghbari. IV. TRADK .

Over 60% of the exports was indigenous i.e. wet and dry dates, salted fish, sardines and fish manure. The remaining 40% was transit trade. (ii) The exchange rate of the Maria Theresa dollar, the local currency, appreciated steadily during the year, from 200 to 260 rupees to 100 dollars. In pre-war days the M.T• dollar and the rupee were approximately at par. The reasons for the present variation are (a) the increased value of the silver content of the dollar vis a vis that of the rupee (b) scarcity due partly to hoarding but mainly to U) increased demand from the interior consequent on the high export price of dates (ii) restrictions on dollar export from Aden and (iii) demand for dollars along the South Arabian Air Route. It is of interest to note that the somewhat debased dollar minted for the use of the Allied Forces in Bast Africa has no currency locally. His Highness the Sultan can spot one almost at a glance l V. THE SOUTH A RABIAN AIR RQlffM. The three aerodromes in the Muscat State viz* at Salalah. Has al Hedd and Masirah, were in operation through out the year.

His Highness the Sultan resided at Dhofar up to the 30th May, when he left for India by United States Army Air Transport Corps plane. He returned to Dhofar In July. His Highness earae to Muscat on the 19th October 1943 and remained there till the end of the year. This was His Highness* first visit to his capital for over a year. Although he complained to the Political Agent that he felt like a prisoner, towards the end of his stay he began to move about quite freely and attended a number of formal functions. He also dined and played tennis informally more than once at the Agency and accepted invitations to English-style dinner parties from the Agency doctor, his Military Adviser and the American Mission. His Highness is still a young man and welcomes relief from the cares of office. At the same time, he can be a quick and businesslike worker and this visit enabled the new Political Agent not only to establish immediate contact but also to settle a number of pressing problems. The ex-Viceroy, His Excellency Lord Linlithgow, presented a Sindhi stud bull to His Highness as a farewell gift. It has been sent to Salalah.

IV. GENERAL CQICTNICATIQNS . (i) Muscat now has direct cable communication with Aden, Bahrain, Bushire and Karachi. (ii) The R.A.F. wireless station works Has al Hadd, Masirah and Sharjah. V. TRANSPORT . Only nine steamers from India and nine from Persian Gulf ports called during the year. The sinking of the 'Dahpu 11 was upsetting and owing to the most extraordinary lack of co-operation between the British-India Steam Navigation Company’s agents, the Post Office and the Soa Transport Officer in Karachi, Muscat was without mails from that port for over five months. internal. The Agency launch was out of action for most of the ear. There is no car for the Political Agent nor can he fford to purchase one, as second-hand cars (without sparesv it fantastic prices are only available. VI. POLICE .

The increase in receipts was mainly from Customs duties and since imports were less in quantity, these figures give an excellent indication of the increased prices of imported goods. The Muscat Government is not alone in profiting out of the War and it now has a reserve of about 24 lakhs. XX. The above figures do not include those for the valu able province of Bhofar, which the Sultan keeps strictly to himself. The administration is also entirely in his hands. 22 X&amp;LJMX* The following His iiajesty's Ships visited Muscat during the year s- 1) H.M#A.S. “Launceston” of the Royal Australian Navy, corvette, and four motor launches, between 13th and 14th May. 2) “Capetown”, on the 29th July. 3) B.W.X.S. “Impala’*, on the 9th October. 4) H.M.S. “SeabelXe 1 ** on the 22th hevoniber, bringing the Hon*ble the Political Resident, accompanied by Mr. T.£.

COMMUNICATIONS . Headquarters, Sind District, established a wireless party at Gwadur on the 3rd August primarily for sending ^ coast watching reports. This station works with Karachi Oiily. VI. POSTS AND TmmMM - There is a Post and Telegraph Office at Gw&amp;dur under the Director, Posts and Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle. Owing to lack of sea communications no post was delivered in Gwadur for the first few months of the year. In June however it was arranged that mails should com® lorry from Quetta to Pasni and thence by eumC- to Gwadur. The telegraph line to Gwadur has also been continual-^ interrupted and up to April all telegrams from Gwadur ^ ° w sent to Prsni by camel for onward transmission by wireless. This^stationalso broke down in April and telegrams were then despatched through the British Overseas Airways corporation a station at Jiw&amp;ni.

Political Agent, Muscat.REPORT OH THE MUSCAT INFANTRY FOR THE YEAR 1943. \QO: (1) MUSCAT DEFENCES . The condition of the local defences of Muscat and Matrah are excellent. No major repairs have been made nor are any required to the permanent defensive works such as forts, town walls etc. This is fortunate as, had any been required they would have been impossible to carry out as cement is almost unobtainable and there have been no contractors in Muscat during the last year. Practically all the carpenters and masons are employed at Ras al Hadd and Masirah. Minor repairs are required to Mirani Fort and Bait-al-FalaiJ. The outer defences of Bait-al-FalaiJ have been completely rebuilt and the line considerably shortened. This was deemed necessary owing to the difficulties of communication. The defensive arrangements for the protection of Bait-al-Falaij and the approaches to Matrah and Muscat from the Batinah and Oman are now based more on the fire power of automatic weapons and artillery rather than on man-power as was previously the case. In addition to the 2.75 and two 3-pdr. guns at Bait-al- FalaiJ we now have a 12-pdr. gun which was salvaged from s.s. ^DabDU* 1 . This gun is in the process of being mounted but awaitb the services of a gunnery expert whom the naval authorities have kindly promised to send down. (2) BATINAH COAST . It has not been possible to carry out a tour of the coast since November 1942 owing to the lack of spare parts a tyres for lorries and to the fact that the launch was wrecke early in the year. (3) LAUNCH . This continued to give good service until March. During a heavy Shimal in this month she broke her moorings in Bav and was washed ashore at the Consulate steps. She remaine here a throughout three tides when ehe v,«twGen two lighters. I took all steps to lighten her during the storm but^avy seas carried away her upper work completely. In* addition she wi bsdly holed onbothsideeofthe hull.

The Force has b««n between ^ttle S abovf t pre-war during ^ **** * th m 3 19^2: Unfortunately this year practically ^^c^tsTave^ if 5 ms is due to the high cost of1 j page 3 - 2 _ (\oy of living and the enormous decrease in the value of the rupee and baiz&amp; which, combined, give a 700% increase on pre-war prices coupled with the fact that coolies at Masirah and Ras al Hadd and R*A«F* Levies at Sharjah and other places draw very much better pay and, in the case of the R.A.F* Levies, much better rations than is the case here. The complete absence of any clothing due to our 1942 clothing over-carrying to Andimeshk and to the 1943 clothing not arriving is also a contributory factor. It Is impossible for sepoys to support a family on their pay at the present high cost of food but should the suggested arrangements for the supply of rations to sepoy* s families at cost price be possible I consider that service in the Infantry will become a much more attractive proposition than it is at present. There has been one promotion to Jemadar during the current year. This is B.H.M. Lashkaran, a Muscat born Baluchi. He has turned out very satisfactorily and has taken over the Machine Gunners who were originally under Jemadar Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur who proceeded on a Police Course in India in 1942 and is now doing an attachment with the Zhob Militia. Jemadar Allah Dad has been promoted to Subedar (I.A.) and Local Subedar Major and Jemadar Hass an Gul to Local Subedar. ( 6 ) TRAINING , r The general standard of training is, in my opinion, good when taking into consideration the very low standard of educa tion of the men available. Practically none of the men could read or write and consequently any learning from Army Manuals is out of the question. I have trained instructors for use in a school but I have been defeated by the impossibility of obtaining writing materials, even slates. I havehowever managed to train all signallers, a number of machine gunners and gunners, all Havildar Majors and a number of N.C^O s to read and write. It is hoped to carry on with this arei eventu ally make a simple educational examination compulsory for promotion beyond Paid Lance Naik* The new recruit training period of 12 weeks instead of 21 has been found to be quite sufficient. After 12 ^oeks men appear to develop more rapidly if put on ordinary duty with their company. The Training Camp which it was hoped to h ^ id in the veer was impossible owing to the lack of tentage and transport. This has been replaced by schemes ^^Lr dave and during the cooler weather men go out for three or fo Sr« ttn*rmovinjy on 'Hard Scale' without tentage etc. Normal Individual and Collective training has been carried ou and Cadre Courses held. Signallers. All are up to I.A. Standard in Flag but a fc ]* ^ 5 ti11 , F 'PVi’i ft Visag been due to shortage of alrS^^r Sig^lli^'lnstructor and superintends the worfc of the Signal Havildar.- 3 - page 4 ( Artillery. Excellent. Owing to shortage of ammunition firing practices have had to be cut down but several practices have been carried out both gun© alone and working with Infantry. The guns are now carried by lorry. Good. Jemadar Lashkaran being new to this work took some time to find his feet but is now doing very well. He was fortunate in that he has four good and experienced M.G. N.C.O*s under him, all of whom are capable of controlling the M.G. Platoon. Training has been carried out with M.G. on pack and in M.T. The results of Range and Field Practices have been very good. Several schemes both in Mountain and Open Warfare have been carried out using live ammunition with troops. It has been found necessary to increase the safety limit when giving over head covering fire and the five-degree safety limit when giving flanking fire owing to the state of barrels and tripods. All guns are overdue for an Arsenal overhaul. Weapon Training. The annual course has produced good results but the L.M.G. results were not good enough. Steps are being taken to rectify this. All men, other than recruits under training have carried out Grenade Training and a short period of Anti- Aircraft Training. This was reduced as not beirig essential. All officers and men armed with the pistol have fired the course as laid down for the Indian Array. There were only three failures. (7) EQUIPMENT AM) CLOTHIM . It is not proposed to deal with this in detail here as Your Highness is fully aware of the situation as is H.B.M . 1 s Consul to whora I have addressed many letters on the subject. Equipment is good. A few items of our indents still have to he delivered but clothing (shirts and shorts) is non-existent.

Nil .455 Revolver ••• ... 380 Grenades ... •,• Nil Cartridges, Ballistite ... Nil The R*A.F., Muscat had some 30,000 rounds of .303 Ball which was time-barred for use in R.A.F. machine guns and it was proposed to 'dump* it. With a view to saving money I offered to take it over free or if necessary purchase it at a reduced price but the quotation given by the R.A.F. was 8 s. 136/- per 1000 as opposed to Rs.56/- per 1000 for new ammunition from India. The H.A.F. therefore still have 30,000 rounds lying useless in I fuse at as it has for years. (9) ANIMAL TKANSPQRT » The M.G. donkeys are in fair condition but are entirely grass fed and would not stand up to hard, prolonged work. Grain is unobtainable and dates which at one time formed part of their ration are prohibitive. Three horses on charge are in good condition. The camels which were originally kept for the transport of artillery before it was carried on M.T. have been handed^ over temporarily to various Walis and can be called in should it bti necessary to transport the guns to soiue place inaccess ible to M.T. The cost of feeding combined with the fact that suit able pack-saddlery was not obtainable rendered them useless. The Farm at Kuwi has effected a large saving in fodder, a considerably larger area has been put under cultivation producing Cherri, Bajri and Lucerne; unfortunately this can never support the animals entirely owing to the paucity of the water supply except from December to February. Motor Transport . roar Chevrolet 30 Cwt. and V /8 Station Waggonsare on charge.^Orw lorry has been immobilised for thel^st ten months for want of a new cylinder head. ™e remainder were overhauled (decarbonised, valves grounded) under .ny Phonal supervision at the beginning of the year.

The ouastion of spare parts has now become acute and 1 . 11 , -tar HiSSrSa “tKi«h ^nlacinff as the present ones are pluggea wit-ix cemerrt? Squire replacement and springs are most urgently required. All these items together with many other essential SSttS SThT. SSAiirttK. S . w u«. ^ *•page 6 This is particularly disappointing in view of the fact that, had export licences been obtainable, I could have purchased all that was required in Karachi either in 1942 or this year. These lorries are used continuously on the road between Matrah and Muscat. I estimate that after the rain in January this road will be quite unfit for the use of M.T. The method of repairing in the past has been to rake loose stones ofjj'the road and when M pot holes” appeared, to level the remaimer of the road down to the bottom of the hole instead of filling up. The road is now so worn that the surface is down to bedrock and little could be done without a stone crusher and a roller. Owing to the terrible shaking the lorries get on this road they have deteriorated greatly in the last few months. (10) MEDICAL . The health of the force has been good. There nave been two deaths, one cancer of the stomach and one Typhoid-fever. Malaria cases have been comparatively few but unfortunately we are out of quinine. Although the M.O., Dr. Hynes, put in the minimum indent a number of essentials such as Cinchona Febrifuge, Mag. Sulphas, N.A.B. and Quinine were ommitted completely. The Consul has been addressed on this subject. The reduction in Malaria and Dysentry cases is presumably due to Anti-Malarial and Fly-Preventive measures which have been taken. The weekly compulsory bathing parade for all ranks, although unpopular in the cold weather, appears to have reduced the number of cases of skin diseases, although ulcers persist in the hot weather probably due to an excessive fish diet and lack of green food. There have been very few new cases of V.D. although a number of men have had recurrent attacks • The M.O. attends Bait-al-Falaij on Wednesdays and Saturdays and at such other times as required; he also, at my request, attends families in their homes. All serious cases are taken into the Agency hospital, Muscat, the remainder are kept in our own hospital. ui) mujm- The present ration consists of *- . ++ci 1 ^ lbs. or ) depending lo’oa. and atta 12 oz. &gt; on what la Rice ... 10 oa. am a,™ aV ailabl..

Chevrolet lorries nave no*-.: been sent to Karachi for remir by Kara.lndas and Uonphny, whether these retire ri.'L.t he poeoxble or not is yel n:?t known.

Httent?on by the To-aits port ilfcalldar, All Hurad rh.o^ I uF.d trained for three months by I oralndas and eSonpany in Karachi. The springe, of the at lorries which hare been in use for the lest two years consist of bumpers will eh I have bought from, old taxis,no rue,re arc nor available. Ihe fan-belts are- still being made out of old web-equip ment, thi s, also, nr.D nor b eu li .uid^ted. The radiators of the two remaining lorries arc no so full of cement that they bell every two or three miles. This constant overhe?ting nato-.’ally causes excessive cylinder wear and it is unlikely that tneae lorries will last more tuan an- other six months* Repairs which would ravve beer possible two years ago, xi&amp;d s_rare? been supplied, have now become impossible even* if v-e should reesim the spares indented for. Nothing short of a major Workshop overhaul would have any chance of putting these? lorries into satisfactory working order, even this, in r«y opinion, may not be possible. X have asked f ;-r an estimate for the repairs of the Uo lorries already In Karachi as 1 am of the opinion that Wig cost of these repairs will e mal f if not exceed the(do) From a glance at the above tables these diseases, exee t Qysenterj .and Diarhoes, show a very high ratio, but this must not be attributed to any negligence, but rather to a want of weapons to combat these infections. Malaria. Shows the highest infection rate. When it is realised that recruitment into this Unit is from Muscat and Matrah where Malaria is ramyant, it can easily be Un - de»stood how infection is carried into the lines. The store-house of infection is the man who goes to see his people residing in one of tne above towns. The G.O. cannot order H Mosquito nets down at sunset' for there are no Mosquito nets. Nor can he order 'Long trousers on at sunset' when slacks are the possession of only the opul ent, Shirt-sleeves are hov/ever worn down from sunset to sunrise. The C.O. does however order all standing water to be drained, all Utility collections of water to be changed every seven days and wells 'fished'. Anti-mosquito cream i available and used but we hope some day to have mosquito nets, etc: as weapons in our campaign. V.D. The actual figures though high are a pleasant surpri to those who know the u£&lt;$rious nature of the people here and around. There are no socia , amenities or amusements for the men of the Infantry, except games which are en - couraged, otherewis* there is nothing. In my capacity as M.O. of the Agency Hospital I am daily in toueh with the Civil Population and know how nigh Venereal incidence amongst the women is. In addition there are no P.A. rooms, no P.T. outfits and a condon is unknown. It is hoped that these measures will be taken up when the war is over. Bowel ^iseages . Dysentery and Diarrhoea i^ave a low ratio. This is also surprising when it is realised that Matrah and Muscat are the Flies Paradise. It can therefore be surmised that the isolated site of the Fort and the atten tion to hygfeene in the Lines are factors reducing bowel infection. Minor Se tic Diseases. Under this head are included the ulcers which are 'and have been the most disgusting sight that one sees dally everywhere. Tnese ulcers respond rap idly to Anti-Syphilitic treatment and thereby prove hered itary syphilis in many persons. Here one might also in - elude men who are placed in the next heading,Deficiency Diseases. There is no doubt that Vitamin deficiency is a vital factor in the ulcer cases. I have noticed that chaplis when first issued cause a large number of abras - ions on the men*8 feet. Deficiency Diseases . Many are the men who might easily have' Seen shown sick under this clause. It is a common complaint one hears ' my legs ache', ' my back hurts and I feel weak'. The men are not malingering but are truth - fully exposing a neurotic condition brought on by lack of vitamin. The food of the soldier in the Infantry Is far better than he would get in his home, nevertheless during summer months there is a lack of vegetables -and there must therefore be a rise in deficiency diseases. The C.O. takes a great Interest in the vegetable garden at Ruwi. Good vegetables are available for the men during the winter and this along with the free good rat - ion has, to my mind, helped recruiting which is now cn the rise. Anti-scorbutic tablets as an issue would I feel sure grea'ly help* Conclusion . In conclusion I place on record the very eat - isfactory Sanitation measuies, water supply and measures to help our work in the little detention Hospital. Here a Naik is left in charge. He has been there five' years, is clean.€ ^ceen and obedient. It is realised tb&amp;t every man en - listed as first a soldier then anything else. By courtesy of the G.O. this Naik Is not suddenly ta^en ror fatigues, route marches, etc,etc; naturally the continuity in treatment of patients is maintained and appreciation felt that this system exists. X-Ray work and major surgical work has been ecL olit at the African Mission Hospital by Dr. w * lboms # M.D. He is always willing to help and his x-rox.t.ciency as a surgeon is very deeply appreciated* V 11• Rations. The ration remains the same as in 1943, i.e. Atta (no rice available) Lbs. Dhal 2 ozs. 1 oa. Salt oz. Onions oz. (approx) Fish 2 oz. ' Wood 2 -| Lbs. Each man pays .Annas 3 p.m. towards Extra Messing which includes M&amp;sala etc. Repeated attempts have been made to get the men to increase this subscription to enable meat to be issued once or twice a week but although men are will - ins to spend up to Rs.10/- per month in Coffee Shops, these attempts have Invariably been met with 1QC$ refusal. The amount subscribed is extremely low when one considers that the normal subscriptions of Indian Amy Sepoys, on lower rates of pay than here, frequently subscribe Rs. 2/8 per month. During the cold weather we still continue to supply the fo lowin ; from Ruwi t- Cauliflower Cabbage Tomatoes Onions Pumpkins Melons Cucumber Brinjal. Chillies Ladles Fingers. Spinach Garlic Tumli Radish Beetroot Beans (various types) Unfortunat ly most of the men refuse to eat such things as tomatoes,cauliflower, cabbage^ spinach and beetroot which would undoubtedly assist in preventing ulcers which are so prevalent and will only eat Radish,pumpkin, brinjals and madles fingers. •A number of Papaya trees planted last year have grown successfully but there is a shortage of fruit owing to the in - ability of any of the gardeners to determine the sex of these trees^ until they reach maturity. I am experimenting with bahanas brought from Sib which seem to be growing successfully. The Canteen is supplying milk, tea, sugar, soap, clotn, cigarettes and matches at about §■ the bazaar costs. Aerated waters have not been available for the ast 8 months as the Government of India have consistently refused export permits for our gas cylinders sent to Karachi for refill.0. V The necessary pemili has recently heen obtained* 12. Sports. 1 1 mummim Hockey and Basketball are placed regularly• The hockey team again won the Open Tournament for the Consulate Club Cup in' April. Sports have been organised and men of the Infantry won the majority of prizes at tne Open Sports meet ing held at the Maqbul Club in March. P.T. is carried out three times a week by all ranks. 13. Building^ . Minor repairs have been carried out to the Barracks. A number of new roof beams are re uir-ed but are unobtainable except at an exorbitant figure. The buildings are, at present, in no way dangerous. During the early part of the year a portion of the roof of the Fort collapsed and an ominous crack appeared in the 'est wall,both of these have now been repaired. During the early part of December serious damage was caused to the FalaiJ and if s 'feeders' which supply the Fort with water from Ruwl, by heary rE *i n * A '. xar f e a !: ® 1: between the Port and the Aerodrome collapsed and » consider - able amount of underground work was necessary to clear the obstruction.

In addition the . a^alj co-lapsed beneath the Soda factory and theMaeJidfortun- ately without damage to the buildings, mis has aiieaay oe n cleared and repaired.

Fight between the Duru and ManeOtrah tribes . - In March trouble broke out in Fhahirah between the Duru and Manazrah tribes which resulted in the latter sustaining 12 casualties. Shaikh Sulaiman bin Kamyar of the Jabal Akhdar and the Imam intervened, and imposed a fine of # 4,000 on tlie Duru Half of this sum entered lii tlie Bait al Mai account, and the balance paid to the Manazrah tribe as bloodmoney 1 or the casualties.

Political Agent, Muscat.y i* Mmm* Th® permanent defenely® works of Muscat are in excellent condition and no essential repairs are necessary. As stated in nsy report for 1943 sob® minor repairs are required to Miraxii and Bait-al»Faisj forts. Tbis eork consists mainly of *‘Facillg ,, and 'Pointing' and can only be carried out when cement becomes available. The outer defences, consisting of Watch Towers and Sengsra for pi quets, have been repaired where necessary and are in good condition. The 12 pounder Naval gun which me salvaged trcm the 'Dahpu* in 1943 and presented by the R.I.N. is still unmounted at Balt-al-Falaj,. As reported last year, th© services of a Naval Qunnexy expert were require, to (heck the deficiencies and give advice as to the mounting of the pn . Sever©.! Naval Officers, including N.O.I.C., Eormus, have been down tc look at the gun but ao to nothing further has been done. The two 2.75 and three 3 pounder guns are in serviceable condition. Various Gunnery instrument© have been recieved which increase the efficiency iS ^y^rate indirect fire possible. The present Gunner T.G.O. has now completed his two years with the Muscat Irffentry and has applied rcr reversion to his Unit, his reasons being thet he thinks he is being passed over for promotion. T is is a comsion c mplaint of young Y.O.OXSeewt hei*e and I think there is some fenaviation for their fears despite the uvs® Instruction to Regimental Centre commanders to the effect that they ©hcuLd ensure thit such V.C.O*s are not overlooked. 2. Batinah Coast - Once more it has been impossible to carry out a full tour of the Batinah CoaH owing to lack of Transport (the Wall of Hatrah was recently a^wd to par eighteen hundred dollars for a tour to Shines and back over a P^od o, a fortnight). This will be dealt with more fully under »aunch and *°tor Transport' paragraphs. The more important forts are, however, in reasonable repair and suitable for the role in which they inould be employed. 3* imm* Under this paragraph in the 1943 report I stated that it was oy inten tion to take the Launch to Karachi for a complete eng a© overhaul, all ar~ rangcR-ent® were made but at the last moment the Port Engineer Karachi unable to undertake the overhaul until many months later- hemann Mo^mtta were then approached but were unable to take the workowingto of Government work. In addition no Insurance Company In India would under take the I surance of the heunch for a passage b«tw en Muscat and Kamcni, thus the whole scheme fell through. The launch is still being used regularly but requires a new Plug leads and Plugs. The Cable and Wireless Company very kindly overImuled the Magneto to the best of their ability and it is working reasonably well., but I do not consider the Launch safe for long journeys unti^ the ab^e re placements ^ave been pad®. Some form of worm has found its way into the hull below th© waterline despite the f act that it has been carefully looked after. It is ay opinion that the wood used originally could not mm been seasoned teak. 4.

Wireless. There Iras been no change in the situation. Various firms have been approached with a view tfc having the sets put In order and providing a suitable Wireless mechanic to Install them,and to obtain operators,but no satisfactory ans weres have been received.The Cable nd wireless Company are of the opinion that it Is doubtful whether a sufficiently highly qualified man could be obtained for much under Es. 8 oo/- peHU The makers,The Premier Radio Company have been add ressed a number of times with a view to obtaining blue prints of the sets as none were sent with the sets, but no answer hvs been received. Mr. Howell of the Cable and Wireless Company very kindly looked at the sets and Is of the opinion that rep airs to the damaged sets might be done locally.He xu-s off ered to attempt to put some in working order when he has the time,but to work them efficiently he says tnat It is essential to have operators who can read and write English reasonably fluently.If the sets were Installed between here and Salalah he is of the opinion that, under the International Contention, It would be necessary to apply to Geneva for the necessary wave-lengths to prevent Interference with other Stations. 4. Strength. The Force his been 24 under strength on the average.

Training Camps have again been impossible owing to shortage of Tentage and Transport, mainly the Utter. Short schemes are held and. as reported last year, are considered more beneficial than long camps, as with the type of man enlisted it is not possible to hold tnelr interest for long periods. The results of Cadre Courses have been better thm usual as the standard has been set higher than previously and promotion stopped if men have failed to qualify at the new standard.

His Britannic Majesty f s Consul, Muscat* MEMORANDUM. Reference your Memorandum No •A# 11/11 dated the 6 th January 1946* Customs Statistics for 1944-45 were forwarded to you with this office letter No.F/1/1024 dated the 1st November 1945 and figures for 1945-46 will be forwarded in due course. My comments on Trade and Commerce are given belov#:- (1) pra-TAR RATE . The rate of dollar after the break out of War with Japan had a rapid rise and remained steady during the year 1945 with slight fluctuation according to demand. It opened with Bs.228 per 100 dollars and closed o* 83.243. The highest rate was Rs. 260 in July and lowest Bs.213 in June. (2) Dry dates are the main article of export from this country and its price has been rising rapidly and since 1942 reached its highest in July 1945 when a Bahar i.e. 1300 lbs were sold, best duality*' for £.1150 and inferior quality for Rs.853 in the begining of the season. However due to arrival of large quantity of dates at one time in Bombay and there being shortage of wag ©as for conveyance of this commodity to other pdrts of India, the price had a sadden fall as a result of which many exporters of dates suffered heavy losses. The prices in November had gone down to Rs.470 for best quality and fis.376 for the infirior quality, t the close of the year however the prices showed some improvement. (3) The condition of merchants remained quite sound and no cases of bankruptcy were reported during the year. Director General of Customs, Muscat.CONFIDENTIAL.

The Municipality were unable to find a successor to Saiyld Abbas bin Faisal, whose services as Director of Public Health were terminated last year. In so far as his time al lowed the Agency Surgeon assisted in the supervision of anti- Bjalarial measures and sanitation, but lack of equipment, the reluctance of the public to permit inspections of house pro perty, and the absence of any responsible official in the Mu nicipality to carry out any suggestions made, rendered progress difficult. Towards the end of the year, some improvement in public health measures was aanifest y due / principal 1 ^ to personal interest taken by the new President of the ^hmici-axity, Saiyid Tariq bln Taimur.

Cerebel aysptottft were observed in sase of these cases. On ly a vexy small proportion of patients treated fr&amp;s solaria bad been infected outside Muscat. the incidsiies of fflftlarie appears to be considerably higher in Mutrah than in the to a of Muscat. Other prevalent diseases were ulcers, digestive diseases, diseases of the eyes, malnutrition and vem*.i diseases. Unusual cases included two of snake-bit® from Rus sell vipers* and the treatment of three fishermen bitten by sharks outside Muscat harbour. Quarantine. Muscat was free from epidemics during the yesr. no quarantine measures were necessary in the case of stea- sters visiting Muscat. One case of small-pox was ^ - adhow in April, but no subsequent cases occurred. Extensive repairs to buildings at the quarantine station at Haramil, which suffered considerabletoa^fro the heavy rains of the previous year, were undertaken Vy the Muscat Government. A permanent guard ^ the quarantine stetlon w._s_ appointed In May and shortly afterwards the Mus eat^oy^ mSrt appointed officials to examine all Mutrah and Muscat either by overland routes or by dhow. in. amastt gaaga»- (a) Tribal In the first three months of the year it seemed likely that a dispute between tho Mua^ ^ trlb .

With the knowledge that the Imam could not be expected to live much longer, he has been aradcua for some time to establish closer relations with the Shaikhs of the Beni Bu Ali, the Beni Riytua and the Birth group, the three most powerful tribes in the interior. The first indication that an approach to the tri bal leaders might meet with satisfactory response, came in a friendly letter from Shaikh lea bin Saleh of the Sh&amp;r- qiyah (Birth), the Imam's most influential supporter, in which he stated that he intended to take no part in any questions concerning future of the Im&amp;mate. Shortly after wards, the Sultan was much gratified to receive letters from Shaikh All bin Abdullah of the Beni Bu Ali and Shaikh Suleiman bin Hasdyar of the Beni Riyass asking to see him at Sur as early as possible. On his way to Muscat in ^ay, the Sultan met these two Shaikhs at Sur and arranged for them to come to Muscat as his guests. The ensuing talks at Muscat gave him great satisfaction and convinced him that the Ghaflri confederation^of which Shaikh All and Shaikh Suleiman are the leaders;would support hi in his aims. Of the attitude of the rival Kinawl faction, the Sultan was less certain; but when Shaikh Isa kin Saleh, the leader of the Hinawls, visited him at Musc&amp;t later in the year there was every indication that more friendly relations than had hitherto existed, had been established between them, Thou$i His Highness was aware that political action would he the sain stay of any success he might achieve in the unifica tion of his state under his rule, the need for sufficient force to discourage opposition led him to approach the Po litical Agent for an indication of the support he mght expect from His Majesty's Government. In making the ap- preach, Bis HiRtaesu stated that whatever ad-rice were him in regard to his alas by the British Government he accept. He toe* the opportunity of discussing this question with the Hon'ble the Political Resident during the letter s visit to Muscat in December and the matter is now under consideration• The events already described inevitably caused tension between the two great political factions in the Interior, the Ghafiri and hinari, each beinj . suspicious of any BOV* by the other which night upset the balance of power between than. In Auguot, tiis pension showed signs of developing into open hostilities in the neighbourhood of the v,adi B-ni Khalid - an “pp t . domination of the Beni Bu Ali of the Ghafiri faction. At the request of Shaikh Ali, and with the, agreeme nt ,of the Sultan and Shaikh Sulairaan, a new Cjadhi was appointee to thisSaSl in September from the Beni Rlyam. On taking ori» charge, this Gadhi hoisted the Inam'e fiag and, tieation of Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, conducted ‘^air* under the Imam's name Enraged by what he considered .o be a HInawl intrigue to usurp his authority, w_aikh Ali^ bin Abdullah of the Beni Bu Ali despatched a f*** to t^r down the flag and to deal suitably the Qadh^ The_ dispute then took a more serious turn, for Shaikh Iss, con sidering that the Imam's authority bad been Infringed, oc USTLmZH by fores and M* — ~* **•*■_ to beat an ignominious retreat. The settled by the Sultan who, with hie customary skill, t the 1the dispute to his own advantage by securing the agreement of all concerned to the appointment of a Qadhi from Muscat. It was further agreed that the new Qadhi should fly His - Highness 1 flag and conduct his affairs in the name of the Sultan. For the first time in the recent history of Muscat, a representative of the Ruling Family, Saiyid Tariq bin Taliaur „ visited Dhahlrah area. The visit was made In July and Au gust and Saiyid Tariq ms well received throughout his tour. (b) Local. Ismail bin Khalil Ar Hassassi, Chief Wall and Wall of Mutrah together with Anwar al Kbatife, headmaster of the Saidleh School, proceeded on leave to Palestine in July. Their places were taken by Saiyid Sultan bin Haaood and Saiyid Thumini bin Shihab, respectively. It became evi dent during the ssonth of Hamadhan that the fomer was not equal to the teak of controlling affairs of Mutrah. Tension between the Khoja and Baluch communities, allowed to grow unchecked, led to stabbing affrays and a threat of serious rioting. The situation returned to normal after ten ar rests had been made by tie Muscat Government and the Poli tical Agent. Saiyid Saud bin All. ^ali of Sur and one of Muscat’s most capable officials was unfortunately forced to relinquish hie charge in September owing to ill-health. He subsequently died at Mutrah in November. His place at Sur was taken by Saiyid Earned bin Hamad pending the appointment oz a permanent successor.

His arrival was celebrated with considerable eclat. Flags flew from Government offices, residences of the members of the Puling Family and Muscat notables; Muscat buildings on the sea front were festooned with bunting, ami sailing craft in harbour were gaily decorated. The reti nues of the various Shaikhs who bad arrived at Muscat to meet him gave him the customary welcome by firing their rifles wildly in all directions - a proceeding fortunately not attended on this occasion by any casualties.

Political Agent, Muscat.KF-PORT on m BfliSCAT INFANTRY FOE THE YEAR 1945. Muscat Defences. There is nothing to add to last year's report, the de fences are in good condition and nothing other than minor re pairs are required. It is proposed to remove one 3 Pdr. gun from B&amp;it-al-Fal&amp;j to the vicinity of the Mutrah Fort, where it will be in a position to cover the town of liutrab and all entrances from the Batinah direction and also the coast road from Muscat to Mutrah. A revision in the defensive system will become necessary in the event of there being any alteration in the strength &amp;nd armament of the Force, as the siting of piquets will be changed. This will also be affected by the it.T* situation. The situation regarding the 12 Pdr, *Dahpu* Naval gun remain, ats.tic. After the first buret of enthusiasm by the Hayy nothing further haa happened, and it rather Iffks aa if it ia to become a permanent aonuaent in the seme way as tm Jahpu herself who continues to disfigure the harbour. The two 2.75 guns are in serviceable condition altVcru# the supply of spare parts asked for in 1944 has not been received It is presured that these are in very short supply as, so far as is known, this gun is not used anywhere elscerxeptbytbe Todd Scouts who have some, X believe as Post guns at Miranishah and Dntta Khel in the Tochi valley in Siaeiristan. 2.

This lorry can do the journey between Muscat and 14utr«h, but the radiator has to be filled up eight time® in the miles* The old R.A.F. lorry hss been purchased from the Consulate, and although this recuire© a lot of attention, it is helping us to carry on. The Govemmcmt of India has agreed to supply four lorries. It is now learned that they arc 15 cwt. and second hand Fords. They are apparently in Bombay and shipment is being delayed pending the receipt of an Export hermit. It appears that the is^ue order for these lorries was published in Delhi in January 1945 and received in Bombay in December 1945- We now hold a very large stock of Chevrolet spare parts as a result of the iwist three years* indents. All these ©ares arrived too late to be of any usa and will have to be returned or disposed of and Ford spares indented for. Vre same applies to tyres, of which we have a considerable stock. 9.

As exports restrictions are being gradually with drawn by the Government of India, imports have begun to show increase by the end of t^ie year as compsrec with the figures of last year, the market is very unstable and there is likely to have no signs of steadiness.
