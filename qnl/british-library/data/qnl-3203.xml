The following has been prepared to serve as an index to sheets rC.. ?o A., &gt;o B. and io.C. of the I inch to 4 miles degree sheets prepared by the Survey of India. , . numbered I, 2, 3 and 4 from top to bottom. fal To describe the position of a place marked on a degree sheet, the number and letter of the sheet (as given on the right hand top corner of the map) are first given, then the letter of the 15 minute rectangle (read on the top or bottom edge of the map and then the number of the 15 minute rectangle (read on the left or right edge of the map). ( k\ To describe the position of a point marked on the degree sheet, 1 it is assumed that each 15 minute rectangle is further divided into ten decimal divisions of latitude and ten of longitude and, after describing the 15 minute rectangle as above, the decimal rectang e containing the point is described in a similar manner, namely by first givinl the number counting from the lelt edge of the i S minute rectangle, and then number counting from the top edge of the 15 minute rectangle. naMssary^w'dep.n^from it,' .he degree sheel speUing is given in brackets after the name. The degree sheet spelling has been departed from in the following in- stances. la) When more than one spelling is given on degree sheets for the same Arabic word, in which case all such names are airanged alpha- betically under one spelling, and cross references given under the others, the word is severally represented on the degree sheets under no less than nine different spellings twa., Cal at “Kaalat” “ Kala , Kalaat , Kalat , Kaleh , K.alet “ Carat” and “ Qaleh ”, and the spelling “ Kata” (or ‘‘ Ralat before the article) has been adopted for the alphabetical list, not as being the most correct, but as that most commonly employed and as giving the pronunciation sufficiently clearly for practica purposes. lb) When the spelling given on the degree sheet ^ calculated to lead v to wrong pronunciation, e.g., Nahr-al-Rubat , for Nahr a Rubat”, of which the former would almost certainly be mis pronounced by anyone not knowing Arabic. -5 The methods of transliteration employed on the degree sheets are so varied thaHt” impossible to lay down any clear guide to the correct pronunoa- tion. but the following points may be of assistance . (fl) The “ L” of the Arabic article “^arO'e.” or “ ul”), when .prefixed ”°SH ’^“T ^&gt;'0™ Z ” assimilates the sound of the initial letter of the word to which it is prefixed. “DH” reoresents three different letters in Arabic^ but the sound (b) of the Engfch “ TH ”, as in “ mother » is suffic.ently near for practical purposes. (c) ' TH ” is pronounced like “ TH ” in the English word thin . Tho tatter (O or K) is commonly pronounced as “G ”, in “give”, {d) The ' e « er ^J{^ hsbut sometimes as 'J” and the letter i-S (K) \s often given the sound of “ CH ”, as in “ church ”, consequently variations in the spelling of names in reports may be expected, according to the idiosyncrasy of the particular informer. 1090 GSBGLOSSARY OF TERMS.
