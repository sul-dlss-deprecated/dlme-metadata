The British Government's position was that Tamb belonged to the Shaikh of Ras el Khaimah [Ra's al-Khaymah], and Abu Musa to the Shaikh of Sharjah, and after re-examining the evidence in 1949 the British Government saw no reason to alter its position. The file also contains papers concerning the island of Farsi, which was subject to claims by Persia and Saudi Arabia, but which the British Government considered to belong to the Shaikh of Kuwait.The file contains correspondence from the Foreign Office, the British Embassy in Tehran, and the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Tamb Island</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Musa Island</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000225#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
