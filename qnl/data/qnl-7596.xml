The purpose of the negotiations was to facilitate the financing and purchase of military aircraft – and related equipment, weapons and ammunition – from British sources for the Afghan Air Force, and to provide for the provision of training for Afghan pilots and mechanics in India. The file also outlines the establishment of the Afghan reserve fund by the Government of India for the purpose of funding expenditure related to Afghanistan.A tour (1936-37) by the Afghan Air Commandant, Ghund Mishar Muhammad Ihdan Khan, of India (Peshwar, Risalpur, and Karachi) and the United Kingdom is also documented in the file; the tour was undertaken at the invitation of the Government of India in order to demonstrate British aircraft and Royal Air Force ground operations. The file therefore includes a number of reports from British officers on the progress of the tour.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: HM Minister in Kabul (Richard Roy Maconachie and William Kerr Fraser Tyler), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, officials of the India Office, and representatives of the Foreign and Political Department (Department of External Affairs from 1937) of the Government of India. The file also contains a limited amount of correspondence with the Afghan Legation and representatives of Hawker Aircraft Limited, as the company chosen to supply the aircraft.A sketch map of Afghanistan can be found on folio 490 illustrating the effective action of the Westland Wapiti from Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, and Farah.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Hawker Aircraft Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Afghan Air Force</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Hawker Hind (Bomber)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Flight training</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military aircraft</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Training</topic></subject><subject><topic>Credit</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00021b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00021b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
