EX/T. h ' 665 '! Foreign Office. 5th Pehruary, 1942. I am directed hy Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit herewith, to he laid before the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a letter which he has addressed to the Treasury regarding the proposed appointment of Mr. R.W. Urquhart as His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz and the consequent elevation of the status of that post to the rank of a full consulate-general. 2. I am to express the hope that, subject to the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, the Government of India will be pleased to approve this proposal, and to accept a moiety of the additional cost as a charge on Indian revenues. 3. I am to request the favour of a very early reply. The Under-Secretary of State, India Office., K 1498/90/^60 EXT ] 1665 ! P0RET0X OPFtGE, 1942 ,, , 4 5th Fetoruar/ # 1942. nfMhDIATfc. Sir, T om directed hy Mr. Secretary Kd«n to state, for the Information of the ;,ord6 Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, that, in view of the extreme Importance of Persia in the existing international situation, and of the need for maintaining a strong cadre of British officials there, he has considered it desirable to arrange for the return to Persia of certain consular officers with previous experience of that country. 2. Among the officers selected in this connexion is ,jr. R.t. Urquhart, Q.S.E., one of His Majesty's Tnspectora-Oeneral of Consulates, who was Hie Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz from 1934 to 1938. For the past eighteen months Mr. urquhart has been on loan to the Ministry of Home oecurit,, and has been serving as Principal fficer in the Office of the Regional Commissioner et Bristol. Ke has now been released from this important post at Mr. Eden’s special request. 3. After discussion with Hie Majesty’s Vinister at Tehran, it has been decided that Mr. Urquhart would be best employed at his former post at Tabriz, which is now within the Soviet zone of occupation and where it is therefore particularly desirable that /Hie The secretary to the Treasury.r EXT ;665 1942 Hie Majesty’s Government should be strongly represented. r. : den therefore pro ^oeee to appoint Mr. Urquhart as His Majesty's (pnaul-Genersl at Mbrlz and T am accordingly to express the hope thffJ ^helr Lordships may be moved, subject to the concurrence of the Government of India, which is now being sought, to sanction the elevation of that post for the duration of the war to the rank of a consulate- general, with a local allowance of £160 a year, and customs allowance on the scale approved for Persia. Tt is suggested that the local allowance should be subject to review in the light of experience. 4. Mr. Urquhert’s special allowance of £200 a year as an T r ,spector-Oeneral would naturally cease to be paid while he was employed at Tabriz. b. T am to request the favour of a very early reply to this letter, a copy of which is being sent to the India Office. T am. Sir, Your obedient hervant, tSd.) A. B.
