The following flood was Sel-i-Kalan } but it is probable that the spring crop supply was only that to be expected in a year of the four years 1880, 1886, 1888, 1889. The spring crop supply in a year of Sel-i-Kalan may be assumed for want of better information at 30 per cent, higher than the above figures {vide Table 8).

TABLE 10. Note on the estimate of the average discharge for each 10-day period of the Helmand River in the year of the great flood, 1885. (1) The highest flood of 1903 occurred in the first week of May, and the highest flood of 1885, in the first week of April. (2) The period of high flood in 1903 was from the middle of March to the end of May, i.e., for about nine weeks. Assuming the same duration for the flood of 1885, the period of high flood in 1885 was from the middle of February to the end of April. (3) The maximum flood discharge of 1885 was measured from many flood marks on the river at Pasand Kushta and Golodan near Kala-i-Madar-i-Badshah and at Kala-i-Mir and Roden. The individual discharges agree very closely and the average value for the maximum flood is 668,050 cusecs. As this flood rose very suddenly ; during the rise the surface slope of the water must have been very great; and it is probable that during the rise of the flood the volume discharged was even greater than this. In Table 2 of Statement E an endeavour has been made to estimate the discharge of this flood at different stages during April. The ratio of the maximum flood discharge in 1885 to that in 1903 was as 167 to 18 or about 9 to 1. (4) A great deal is known about the river in the year of this flood. The Afghan Boundary Commission crossed the Helmand at Chaharburjak in October 1684, and a portion of the Mission again on their return in December 1885. They found the river in much the same state according to their description as it was in the same periods of 1902 and 1903. From enquiries made among the people it appears that the tamarisk hand at Kuhak was made at the usual time in 1885. The discharge of the river therefore, at that period could not have been higher than 2,500 cusecs. This figure, therefore, is assumed for the last 10-day period of September 1885, and the figures for the 10-day periods from October 188410 February 1885, also'from June 1885 to September 1885, are estimated to be much the same as for the corresponding periods of 1902 and 1903. The figures for the autumn of 1884 were probably overestimated, while those taken for the autumn of 1885 in Table 12 are probably underestimated. The great flood of 1885 is described in Appendix 25 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes;” the information is worked up in the calculations given in State ment E.STATEMENT B. CONTENTS.

Table 10. —Volumes for the flood in Gaud-i-Zireh. Note. The areas have been measured with a Planimeter in square miles. The scale of the Map No. LV from which the areas are taken is i inch to a mile ; therefore one square inch of area is equal to 16 square miles or 16 x 5,280 x 5,280 feet. To save time the figures showing areas and volumes are not multiplied by (16 X 5,280 x 5,280), but left as they a^e and termed 16 square miles or 16 square mile feet as the case may be. A 16 square mile area is an area of 16 square miles ; a volume of 16 square mile feet is so much water as will cover 16 square milts of aiea one toot deep, or one square mile of area 16 feet deep. 5,163 cubic feet a second flowing for 24 hours will cover 16 square miles one foot deep.

The southern half of the Gaud-i-Zireh shown as the saline tract on the survey map is nresumablv the deepest part, as the levels at the ends of cross section No. xxiv and of the Longitudinal Section alono- the Sar-i-Shela No. xvi show. The northern half of the basin is described on the map as alluvial this tract extends from Langar-i-Sultan at the eastern end to Pas Kunaki at the western. 1 he alluvial is the delta of several nalas, vie., the Robat River which enters the Gaud-i-Zireh at Langar-i-Sultan; Rud-i-Kuchk, an old distributary of the Helmand.and many other smaller drainages which during the light sprine rains bring a large amount of silt. This alluvial clay plain therefore slopes from the deep part of the Gaud-i-Zireh up to the scarp of the dasht or gravel plain which forms its northern boundary. 2 The drainage from the range of hills to the south of the Gaud-i-Zireh is caught m and evaporated from the depressions among the sands which intervene between the hills and the Gaud-t-Zireh ; and hence no alluvial is formed along the southern margins of the Gaud-i-Zireh. The flood marks of 1885 were read on Cross Section xxiv at Oruk ; also on the Longitudinal Section'xvi along the Sar-i-Shela. The depth of water that stood in the deep part of the Gaud-i-Zireh was [I S? 64-t S 3 T 9 ) or 31 74 feet, vide Cross Section xxiv.

It is probable that a part of the Gaud-i-Z.reh is deeper than this, vie., the part which held water in 1896, and which was surveyed in by Colonel McMahon when he came here in April of that year. This is shewn in blue on the maps that were then prepared and has been transferred on to our map. 4 The depth of water against the scarp which forms the northern boundary of the Gaud-i-Zireh was ( 1 .565‘64—1,27)° o r &gt;3 feetf vide Cross Section xxiv.

TABLE 3. The volume of the water brought in by the rivers in proportion to the sum of the maximum flood discharges of each in 1903. The volume might also be calculated in proportion to the maximum flood dicharge. The flood discharge of the Helmand for 1903 was 72,000* cusecs and the estimated discharge for the flood of 1903 of Khash, Farah and Harudare 7,561 ; 3 2 &gt;434 an d 14,234 cusecs, respectively, or a total of 54,229 cusecs. This total is three-quarters of the flood discharge of the Helmand. Therefore the volume poured in by these three rivers if taken in proportion to their flood discharges is (2,171,611 X j) or 1,628,708 cusecs during the period underestimate ; this is equal t0 3*5*48 16 square mile feet. To this we must add the figures for the Khuspas, Bandan, etc. (in lines 6 and 7 of Table 2), making a total of 381-07 16 square mile feet against 332-99 (in line 8 of Table 2) got by assuming that the volumes are in proportion to the catchment areas. A difference of 14 per cent. The actual difference is 48 08 sixteen square mile feet- equivalent to a discharge of 2,680 cusecs flowing for 92 days: or since the whole area of flood in 1903 w-as 112-56 sixteen square mile feet, the difference represents about five inches of water over the area.

TABLE No. 6 a. Note on Table 6 of Statement C. Note to explain the areas oj the Hamun taken for calculating the amount of evaporation. Up to the 10th May very little water had flowed south of Rah-i-Gardowak May , 903 and hence the flooded area was only that of the Hamun-i-Puzak and Sabari with their Naizar. By the 20th May only the Hamun-i-Sangal was filled to the south of Rah-i- Gardowak and so only its area is taken for this Hamun. By the 31st May an area of 16-93 16 square mile feet is taken for the Hamun-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja, which j une , go3 could not have risen above a level of 1,594 00 by that time. Up to the 20th June the area at flood level for the Hamun-i-Puzak and Sabari are taken, and the area of 16-93 rnile feet up to a level of 1,594*00 for the Hamun-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja. On the 15th of June the Hamun-i-Puzak was cut off from the Sabari ; hence in calculating evaporation from the 20th to 30th of June the Hamun-i-Puzak is omitted. The flood level area of the Hamun-i-Sdbari, i.e. y 46*00 sixteen square mile feet, is taken and for the Kuh-i-Khwaja Hamun an area up to the level of reduced level 1,597*00, because this Hamun did not reach its full flood level till the middle of July. Up to 10th July the same areas are taken as for the last 10 days of June. j uIy igo3 From the 1 ith to 20th of July the Hamun- i-Sabari fell from reduced level 1,603-2 to reduced level 1,601*9. Hence an area corresponding to reduced level 1,601*9, i.e., 42*75 16 Square mile feet, is taken. The area for the Kuh-i-Khwaja Hamun is taken to full flood level of 1,600*00. From the 21st to 31st of July the Hamun-i-Sabari did not fall much below reduced level 1,601-9, so an area up to that level is taken. The Kuh-i-Khwaja Hamun fell to reduced level 1,598*00, much water having flowed out into the Sar-i-Shela; the area was then 30*15 16 square mile feet. The area for the first 10 days is the same as for the last 10 days of July. August 1903. From the nth to 20th the area of water in the Sabari is taken to reduced level i,6oo*l to which it then fell ; and for the Kuh-i-Khwaja Hamun, the area is taken for the stage at reduced level 1,597*00 to which it fell by the 20th August. From the 21st to 31st August, the same areas are assumed. The area for September .903. the Ham u n ‘s taken for a stage at reduced level i,6oo-i, because the water remained in the deep part of the Hamun and Naizar only; and the area under exposure to evaporation remained much the same. The area taken for the Kuh-i-Khwaja Hamun is 30*15 16 square mile feet for reduced level 1,597*0 which it kept up to the 10th of September 1903. For the rest of the period the same areas as obtained at the end of Septem- October, November and December ,903. ber ' 9°3 are as the area exposed tO evaporation during these months remained much the same all through.43 STATEMENT C.

So that the volume is under-estimated in Tables 8 and 9 by 170 sixteen square mile The whole loss on evaporation in the Hamun-i-Sdbari and Kuh-i-Khwaja in Tables 8 and 9 is 608 sixteen square mile feet ; the diffe rence is therefore o 28 of the evaporation. It would, therefore, seem that a rate of evaporation of 0-7 of that in Appendix 3 would be more correct. r ° Ncnz.^The Sauthern Hamun (Kuh-i-KItivaja) is fed from the Northern Hamun (Sdbari) by the flood water overflowing the ridge called Uah-i-uardoivak, which acts as a weir, very much more elaborate measurements than could be made must be obtained to calculate this flow with correctness. The above Statement will give some idea of the problem. N.B. A small volume of water must have been brought into this Hamun by the Madai river in April j but it is not taken into acrount the evaporation must have reduced it to a negligible quantity. * I he level of water was R. L. 1,597 and calculated volume from the plans is no - 597. The difference is large, t The Sar-bShela began to flow on the 20th June. The average daily discharge is 778 cusecs [vide Appendix 14 of this Report). From 20th June to 15th July, total discharge is 377 16 'square mile feet. The level of the flood was Reduced Level 1,600; 'he volume of the Hamun calculated from plans was 210-617.STATEMENT D. CONTENTS.

Water surface of the Hamun on the nth September 1903 was Reduced Level 1,598-30. The evaporation from nth September 1903 to 31st December 1903 was 1*5. Therefore Reduced Level of water surface on 1st January 1904 was probably 1,596-80. The high flood level in 1904 of the Hamun south of Rdh-i-Gardowak down to Sar-i-Shela is 1,597-00; and the volume of water corresponding to this level is 110*60 16 square mile feet {vide Table 7, Statement B). Therefore the volume of water in the Hamun south of Rah-i-Gardowak on 1st January 1904 was presumably ioo’oo 16 square mile feet. IV.—The volume in the 'whole inundated area on 1st January 1904. 16 square mile feet.

But from a perusal of Tables 8 and 9 of Statement C, it will be seen that by the calculations made from the volume poured in and the loss by evaporation that the volume in the Hamun-i-Sabari at the end of December 1903 is only 177*20 and in the Hamun south of Rah-i-Gardowak 2*45. If 42*20 (as above) is added as the volume in the Puzak Hamun on 1st January 1904, the total volume in the three Hamuns comes to (42-20 -f 177*20 + 2-45) or 221-85 16 square miles against the calculated volume 392-20 (given above). The difference is 170-35 16 square mile feet, equivalent to a volume of 2,432 cusecs flowing for a year, or to a depth of 1:5 feet over the full area at flood level (112-56 16 square miles). This shows that either the loss by evaporation on this wide expanse of the Hamlin is not so much as is taken in the calculations for evaporation in the Tables 8 and 9 of Statement B, or else that the volume of inflow during the latter part of the year is greater. As the last item depends on the carefully observed volumes of the Helmand, it is probable that the loss by evaporation in the calm autumn weather over such a large expanse of water some of it hidden among reed beds is much less than in the open water whose rate of evaporation was measured in Appendix 3 of this Report.TABLE 5.

From the information collected from the people the volume of water in the Hdmun on the 1st of January 1885 was much the same as the volumes measured by us on the 1st of January 1905. This volume is 231-91 16 square mile feet {vide Statement B, Table 6) and this has been introduced in Table 1, line i, ac cordingly. 2. A separate discharge table has already been prepared for the great flood of 1885 in Table 9 of Statement A, and in Table 2 of this Statement the discharge for each day of April is given and the volume poured in by all the rivers is cal culated on the supposition that the other rivers discharged volumes proportionate to the maximum volume of discharge in 1903 as explained in Table 5, Statement C. The volume poured into the Hamdn for each month from the 1st of January to the end of September is given in Table 4 of this Statement. 3. It is assumed from information obtained from Mr. W. A. Johns, Consult ing Engineer of Railways {vide “Revenue Report and Notes/’ page 539) that the maximum flood came down the river on the 7th April. From information obtain ed from the Baluchis the water that went down the Taraku bed reached the Sar- i-Shela about the 10th April, while the flood water from the Hamdn to the north arrived about the 20th April. The Sar-i-Shela was then full to overflowing. But by the 10th of May the level of the water had subsided two feet, and early in June it had subsided six feet from the high flood mark. About the end of September the Sar-i-Shela became fordable to men and unloaded camels (say 4 0 feet depth of water on the ford). After that it was fordable except when the high wind blew. 4. Mr. Merk crossed the Cardan Reg Ford (about f mile upstream of the boundary) on the 29th of December 1885 and from the measurements he gave there was then about i,ojo cusecs flowing. Mr. Merk says that in April and May the Sar-i-Shela was unfordable and even • The weather was warm and there was no wind } n December a high wind* drove down a during Mr. Merk s visit to these parts. volume of water from the HAmiin sufficient to close the ford for a day or two. Mr. Merk also said the flood mark on the south-western shore would “ lead to the conclusion that since May 1885 the level of the Hdmiin had fallen 4 or 5 feet at most ; here, however, in the southern part of the Hamun it is probable that the violent north-west wind which blows steadily in Seistan from May to August has raised the high water mark above its true position along this section of the shore.” In the next march he says !&lt; the road lies along the shore of the Hamun which here stretches away a deep blue sea to the horizon on the east; the oppo site shore is not visible and the surface of the lake is unbroken by grass or reeds. The water as it evaporates leaves long mud flats on which Bunnun springs up in great abundance.” He says the ferry was then at Bahring 3 miles north of the Mil-i-Nadir. This means that the tutin crossed by Rah-i-Surkh Ghazi which is only used in high flood ; in proof of this further on Mr. Merk remarks: “ So much of the basin of the Hdmun as in dry years is not submerged, is said to have filled in 10 days in consequence of the heavy floods of April 1885. From the water marks J at Bahring, the line of the lake has fallen oHL t ««r L on , f s f'fan».r, .886 a little over 3 feet from Mayf to December was R L. 1,604 00 much the same as at the height t §85. The Water Will Continue to dimmish of the flood of 1903. till March 1886; then the spring floods will not only check desiccation, but will probably raise the level, although possibly not to the height attained in 1883. Consequently it is not unlikely that it will take many years for the Hamun to shrink to the area shown as being permanent ly under water on our maps.” (“ Records of Intelligence Party, Afghan-Russian Boundary Mission.”)STATEMENT E. NOTE ALPHA— contd. It therefore appears that the H&amp;mun was full to high flood level up to the end of May 1885 and the Sar-i-Shela also flowed at its highest level. In June the water began to subside in the Northern Hdmiins under the influence of the evaporation and the volume drawn off by the Sar-i-Shela. As the level of the water fell the effect of the wind would have a great influence on the outflow through the Sar-i-Shela by raising the level of the water at its mouth and also by driving the water out over dry lands and leaving a thin film behind to windward— a process which must largely increase the losses by evaporation and absorption. Yet the calculation made on the assumption that the evaporation alone was that given in Appendix 3 without taking into account the effects of absorption or the action of the wind shews that the Hdmun would be nearly dry at the end of De cember 1885, whereas we know from Mr. Merk that there was a very large volume in the Hdmun. It is possible that the evaporation on a long sheet of water like this lying almost in the exact direction of the wind is very much less than it is on isolated sheets of water over which hot dry air is always passing, whereas in the former case during light wind the moist air is moved forward over the sheet of water and the loss by evaporation is thus reduced. Table \a has been work ed out on the assumptions explained therein, the result of which is to throw the unknowns into the figure for evaporation. The volume evaporated comes to about half that arrived at in Table 1 of this Statement. But the data on which the calculations are made though very useful are not exact, and the flow from one Hamlin to the other over the ridges at Rah-i-Mesh Kushi and Rah-i-Gardowak and again into the Sar-i-Shela is very complicated. The Sar-i-Shela down to the boundary crossing at Gardan Reg is a long channel with a level bottom and is always spoken of by the Baluchis, who have seen it full, as a long deep chung — a description we did not understand until we have levelled along it.58 STATEMENT E.

The volume brought down in the great flood was so enormous that it is necessary to work out the volumes during April in detail in order to in any way compare calculated discharges and volumes with those obtained from the evidence of eye-witnesses. Full details are given in the footnotes of column io. The volume poured in by all the other rivers for each day of the month has been worked out and is given in column 8. The people say that the river was running full before the high flood came down. A discharge of 50.000 cusecs may be assumed for these dates. t From the account given by the Baluchis it is gathered that at midnight of 6th April the river suddenly rose 12 feet. 1 he maximum flood discharge calculated from flood sections is 668,050 cusecs. X Vide column 9, Table of 4 this Statement. This volume might with advantage be distributed over lo or 12 days. § By the 9th it is said that the river fell by 6 feet. The discharge corresponding to this level will be about 500.000 cusecs. R On this date the river rose to within i-£ feet of the former high level which gives roughly a discharge of 600,000 cusecs.

Since the area of this flood in the Gaud-i-Zireh is 66*34 16 square miles (1,06144 square miles) the discrepancy amounts to over 6 feet depth of water over the whole area. On the other hand, a large volume of water must have r w , ie ^ ^ 00&lt; ^ spread out over the sand-hills on the northern bank ot the Sar-i-bhela, for this channel over-flowed its bank all alon 0, its length. A large volume must also have been absorbed in the dry bed of the Gaud-i-Zireh and when the flood spread up to the sand-hills around Ziarat Shah-i-Mardan the absorption as well as the evaporation was very great. Under these circumstances it is quite conceivable that a depth of 6 feet of water was absorbed over the whole of th'S area drunk up by sand-hills and parched plains of salt and alluvial. At the end of Chapter VI on the rate at which water is dissipated by evaporation it is shewn that the rate of evaporation on the Gaud-i-Zireh was about half that obtained on the Jai Surkh Nawar, but this information was deduced from figures got when the water had alien to a lower level, and retired from the dry slndy tracts, and was held on the staunch bottom of the basin. Moreover, the water had hen become saline and it may be that the rate of evaporation from salt water is water ' S ° m PUre ’ ^ * Watet b ° ils 3t a h 'S her tem P«ature than pure of fl0We ? thr °”ghout the whole of the winter of 1885-86and throughout 1886 and in the flood season of 1887.

Calculations made on the assumption that all the water of the river Helmand passed direct to the Gaud-i-Zireh, the remaining rivers discharging to the same Hamuns to which they do at present. The depth evaporated will be taken one-half that given in Appendix 3. This will be on the safe side and is more likely to be the correct figure, seeing that the largest volume will be in the deep Gaud-i-Zireh where the water will become saline and where the velocity of the wind is probably less than in the Northern Hamun.

The Gaud-i-Zireh a permanent lake.STATEMENT F Note to Table io. This calculation shews that when the Helmand River discharged all its stream into the Gaud-i-Zireh it formed a deep permanent lake in that depression. The reason for this is that the large volume was stored in a very deep lake of comparatively small area, so that the annual loss by evaporation* was much less than it is now that the water is spread out in a shallow sheet partly over reed marshes, where the vegetation must evaporate large volumes, and partly in shallow pools, which expose the maximum of area to the action of the hot dry wind of high velocity. This water is kept always sweet by the flushing of the pools that takes place every flood, whereas the water in the Gaud-i-Zireh becomes highly saline as it is never changed. There is reason to think that the wind velocity over this depression is not so great as it is over the Northern Hamun as the sand brought from Seistan has been dropt all along its southern shore. The Helmand River has not gone direct to the Gaud-i-Zireh for numberless ages. This is evident from the configuration of the Delta of the Taraku trough and the disposition of the innumerable village sites scattered over it; they are very ancient as they yield the most primitive forms of pottery and also palaeolithic implements. Since the time of these evidences of man’s existence in the Delta of the Helmand, the river distributed itself in the Ramrud, Hauzdar tract in such a way that only a portion of its volume could have gone direct to the Gaud-i-Zireh. But even at that time there must have been a permanent lake of considerable depth in the Gaud-i-Zireh. The scarp at the end of the glacis of the Dasht-i-Zireh which forms the northern shore of the Gaud-i-Zireh must have been cut from the wash of this lake. This scarp caught Mr. Johns’ observant eye when he crossed the Gaud-i-Zireh to Kirtaka in March 1903 and he drew attention to it. When this glacis formed, the Rud-i-Kuchak or Johns’ Nala and other channels noted by him were in flow and the glacis must have extended to meet the glacis of the Baluchistan hills, just as the glacis of the present Helmand extends towards the Palan Kuh and Bandan Hills. We have not been able to search this glacis ; it w’ould be most interesting to know if there are remains of man on it. * Only in exceptionally great floods do the waters reach the Gaud*i'Zireh and on such occasions we know they last a long time,V STATEMENT Fa.

Explanation of the colouring on the map to a scale of 4 miles to an inch. Plan XV among those piled in the box. , Green. —Represents the area irrigable by existing canal systems, and from which portions varying year by year in extent and position only are cultivated. Light yellow. —^Represents areas formerly irrigated by old canal systems and which could again become irrigated either by opening new canals, or by the river itself changing its course. Pink. —Represents tracts in above formerly cultivated, but now covered by high sand-hills, among which cultivation would perhaps not be possible, at any rate, for a considerable time after water had been brought to the surrounding tract. Dark Represents areas which probably have never been cultivated in the past, but which could be commanded, irrigated and cultivated by high level canals. Represents isolated plateaux of higher level not accessible to canals from the Helmand. -Represents /fawwra or deeper basins in which water collects, and from which it seldom dries up. The Naizar or reed marshes are indicated by markings to indicate reeds, which are put on a blue ground for those marshes w hich are seldom dry, and on a white ground for the marshes which become dry each autumn. The higher ridges or lurga are indicated by light brown. The sloping shores of Bunnunistan, which are only inundated for a short time at the height of a flood are shown by bands of green. The area thus coloured was that over which the waters extended in the floods of I903* At this level they overflow through the Sar-i-Shela to the Gaud-i-Zireh. After the floods have subsided only the deeper portions, which are indicated by darker blue, are filled with water. Blue Represent the area of the Gaud-i-Zireh, a very deep depression which contains water of varying extent according to the amount of overflow from the Hamun in years of high flood. It is divided into a saline tract {blue and unite bands) and a sweet or alluvial clay tract {blue and yellow bands).STATEMENT I. CONTENTS. Nawar. Table /.—Chah-i-Nima Bala. Table r.—Jai Surkh Nawar.

CONTENTS. The annual area of cultivation in acres now done from the water which reaches the Band-i’Seistan, including the Sultani canal. It is necessary to include the cultivation of the Sultani canal, because this area was irrigated from below the band till 1904. The figures then give the area of cultivation from the Helmand under the Hakim of Chakhansur. A few small discrepancies have crept into the figures for Afghan Seistan due to changes in the Sultani canal, and in the Khwabgah canal, the latter was transferred from the Hakim of Kala-i-Fath to that of Chakhansur, and back again and again retransferred during our stay in the country.STATEMENT K.
