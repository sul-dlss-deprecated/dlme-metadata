Sultan has sent me a Muscat! passport given by his government to &amp;n*xxk Mohammad bin Hamad Sheikh of Fujairah for grant of visa Bahrain.

Tiie Honourable tiie political itesidenc, in tne Persian Gulf, BlfcKIKS. f v ^ p Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram Bo. 0/75 dated March 3rd 1939 and to enclose a copy of a letter from H.H. Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat which was received by Major R.P.itfatts on the 21st of March 1939. 2. There is no record, of the conversation which is mentioned in Major Y/atts* telegram Ko. 5* dated the 2nd oi March but the Sultan’s letter under reference clearly indicates th&amp;tythe Sheiich of Fujairah is his subject and preeumabiy the small Sheikhdom as part of hie domain. 3. Although at one time undoubtedly part of the Jawatcin Sheijdidoin of Sharjah I think it will now be difficult to determine whetner the Sheikh of Fujairah is independent or whether he may still be considered as under the Sheikh of Sharjah or thex2 or the Sheikh of Kalba. However that is a matter with which I am not concerned. An examination of the records shows that Fujairah is not ^art of Muscat and further establishes the fact that succeeding Sultans of Muscat have shown a tendency to interfere in Fujairah affairs inapite of various warnings. 4. I suggest that X be authorised to make it clear to the Sultan that Fujairah is not.a pgrt Ql’ his domain and that the Sheikh cannot be recognised as a Muscat subject. Before making this communication to the Sultan I should like to be informed to whom it is considered Fujairah does belong as I should expect the Sultan to ask that question. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

The Secretary to the Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 0082 dated the 9th of June. 2. I understand that on receipt of your telegram No. 0/75 dated the 4th March the Sheikh was offered a travel document and refused to accept it. The Sultan made a verbal protest to my predecessor,Major R.P. Watts, objecting to the issue of a separate document and requesting that the passport be visa-ed. This verbal request was followed by the written one that formed an enclosure to my letter No. C/77 dated the 1st May. 3. I shall be grateful if I may be informed what reply should be addressed to the Sultan to his request that the passport be visa-ed. The Sheikh of Fujaira is not at present here but I have no doubt the question will be raised as soon as he returns and would like to be in a position to make an immediate reply. 4. The Sultan has now made what amounts to both a verbal and written claim to Fujaira. I presume that failure to oppose this claim could not be construed as / acquiescence2 acquiescence.

' Please refer to my letter No. C/112 dated the 10th June. 2. I am afraid that when I wrote my letter No. C/77 dated May 1st I did not know that the Sheikh had actually been offered a travel document and had refused to accept one, and that the Sultan had objected. It was only after discussing this case with the Treasury Officer, who is in charge of the confidential records, that these facts came to my notice. This was due unfortunately to the lack of complete records of interviews between the Political Agent and the Sultan. I am now having a full note kept of all official conversations between myself and the Sultan. iV*. Captain H.D. Bushton, I.A., Secretary to the Hon r ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire./ 4 . cgmasyriAL IJo. Dated the bth July, 1939. To The Political Agent, Mus ca t. MEMORANDUM SUBJECT : Claim of Sultan of Muscat to Fujaira. Reference correspondence ending with your demi- official letter No. c/116, dated the 12th June, 1939, to Rushton, I have discussed this question with Political Agent, Bahrain, since Fujaira is an appanage of the Shaikh of Sharjah or of Ra8-al-i£haimah. 2. Briefly, the Sultan has requested you to put a visa for Bahrain on the passport of the Shaikh of Fujairah, the said passport being a Muscati one. If this visa is given it is tantamount to our acknowledging the Shaikh as under the suzerainty of Muscat. 3. I enclose herewith a copy of a letter No. 821 B of 30th April 1903, from the Government of India to the Political Resident, from which it will be seen that at that time both these authorities, as well as the Secretary of State for India, were strongly of the opinion that Fujaira should remain under the *Jowasmi Chief8 ,, , but that they had no desire ’•to interfere authoritatively' in the ? &lt;• DAI ACENCY ' 1 WiuENTIH RECORD R*i£, Vo; 3 6 ^ I t 3. f«i’3 COi'iJULA 11 MUSCAT, | internal disputes of 'these parts’ 1* &gt; . 4. We cannot therefore countenance the suzerainty of Muscat over Fujaira by giving the visa referred to above. 1 imagine that it was to obtain some such acknowledgment from us indirectly that tbe question of the visa was ar ranged between the sultan and the Shaikh of yujaira. It is not certain however, that the Shaikh of yujaira does actually realize that by taking out a Muscat! passport he puts himself under the Sultan* we are not bound by our treaties with the 'Jowasmi ChiefB ,, to guarantee their terri tory, but if the Sultan did take over yujaira we would doubt less have complaints from either the Shaikh of Sharjah or Ras-al-Khaimah, or both, and there would be a good deal of unpleasantness and various complications. 5. It seems to me that this is a case that we should try to keep at arms' length for as long as possible. Should the Sultan therefore raise it again you should explain that you cannot give a visa on the Shaikh of JPujaira's passport as that would be an acknowledgment on our part that yujaira belonged to Muscat. You should proceed to ask the Sultan what the grounds are for his claim to Fujaira, and inform him that you are sending these grounds to me. You should express no opinion on these grounds nor inform him at this stage that it is our opinion that Fujaira does not belong to Muscat. * 3d/- fvOvyewle Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Kemball, Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Dated Simla, the 30th April 1903, Sir, I am directed to refer to your letters noted in the Ho .16 S.Af, dated the 20th July 1902.) margin regarding the Ho,22, dated the 14th Fe bruary, 1903.) question of jurisdiction on the Batineh coast. 2. It appears that for long the Shaikh of Fujeira has been endeavouring to free himself from the authority of the Jowasmi Chiefs, and that, on various occasions, he has invoked the assistance of the Sultan of Maskat with a view to effecting this object. In your letter, dated the 20th July 1902, you suggested that, in the event of the Chief of Shargah being un reasonable in the treatment of his feudatory, and being unable to give him adequate protection, it might become necessary to consider whether Jowasmi authority should not cease tc^xist on this coast, and whether the strip should not be handed over to the Sultan of Maskat. In your later letter, written after fuller enquiry, you state as your opinion that no extension of Maskat influence over this tract should be countenanced, and you express the hope that hereafter, when the headman of Fujeira sees that he has no hope of obtaining assistance from this quar ter, it may be possible to effect a satisfactory settlement of /thev&gt; 2. the long standing disputes between this sheikh and the Chief of Shargah, whose differences you have hitherto been unable to reconcile• 3, The Government of India entirely accept your later view that no interference by the Sultan of Maskat should be allowed Despatch from the Government of India, to His ) in this tract, Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, 2To,192) dated the i;3rd October 1902* ) , . , . ^ , ' which has long Despatch from His Majesty’s secretary of state) f or India, flo,4, dated tne 27tn February 1903,) been regarded as i.ubordinate to the Jowasmi Chiefs. prom the accompanying copies of correspondence it will be seen that this view has been accepted by His Majesty’s Secretary of State.

The correspondence begins with the reported death of Shaikh Saif bin Hamad ash-Sharqi [Shaikh Saif bin Ḥamad Āl Sharqī], Ruler of Fujairah, on 24 December 1938. The rest of the file concerns the Sultan's claim that the Shaikh of Fujairah is a subject of Muscat.In the file the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat reports that he has received from the Sultan a passport – given by the Muscat Government to Shaikh Saif bin Hamad's brother and successor, Muhammad bin Hamad – so that the Political Agent may grant a visa for Muhammad bin Hamad's passage to Bahrain. The remaining correspondence is concerned with how the Political Agent should respond, since it is suspected that the granting of a visa would amount to the British recognising the Sultan's claim.The principal correspondents are the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.The Arabic language material consists of a letter received by the Political Agent from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (an English translation is included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shaikh of Fujairah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Fujairah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Visas</topic></subject><subject><topic>Kings and rulers--Succession</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00000f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
