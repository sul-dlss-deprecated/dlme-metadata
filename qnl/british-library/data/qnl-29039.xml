In your: express letter No.C/595 of 4th August, 1946 you mentioned that the Sheikh of Sharjah had raised the question of the rent of the rest-house and buildings at Sharjah and had also asked for increased rent for the Air Station, and that if necessary you would put forward specific recommendations on the Sheikh’s claims in due course. Air Hinistry are obtaining list of buildings which they will require permanently at Sharjah, together with list of those which will be available for disposal. Latter will of course become the property of the Sheikh, but Air ministry feel that this should not happen without an attempt to obtain some quid pro quo from Sheikh, possibly in the form of an undertaking or agreement that rents should not be increased.

They state that the airfield at Sharjah is a permanent requirement as a staging post on the Royal Air Force trunk route to the Far East, and that the Air Ministry would accordingly be prepared, under suitable conditions, to take over responsibility for this airfield from B.O.A.C. and to provide such emergency facilities as B.O.A.C. may require. There will be no regular R.A.F. requirement for the use of Dubai, and the Air Ministry think it would be all right to discontinue the lease of this base. They will, however, probably want the moorings left in place in case of emergency. 3.

The issue of the above has been duly authorised. F. A. K. HARRISONWith the conpliments of the Director-General of Civil Aviation. R.13848/46. 25th June, 1946. Dear Cheetham, B.O.A.C. have informed us that when the 'C' Class Flying boats are withdrawn at the end of this year they will no longer need the staging posts at Sharjah/Dubai which are at present used for land planes and flying boats respectively. They enquire whether the S.A.F. have a continuing interest in Sharjah and if so whether they would be prepared to maintain signals and other facilities there. So far as B.O.A.C. themselves are concerned they would only want to keep one mooring for emergency use. Prima facie if B.O r A.C. no longer need to call at Sharjah and Dubai there is no reason v/hy they should continue to provide facilities there unless in view of the present political situation in Persia it is considered desirable that v/e should retain any footholds wo already have on the Persian Gulf. The present arrangements at Sharjah and Dubai are covered by agreements with the Sheikhs. The original agreements terminated in 1943 when they were renewed for a further period of five years. They therefore have two more years to run before expiring. The agreements provide- for the provision and operation by Imperial Airways (now B.O.A.C.) of aerodrome facilities for their own purposes at specified financial terms and for landings by R.A.F. aircraft free of cost. We believe that the R.A.F. have in fact a continuing interest in Sharjah which they contemplate retaining as a staging post on the strategic route to the East but that this will not necessarily involve regular flights. Apart from the political considerations India is also interested because she will sooner or later be operating airlines to the Persian Gulx frcm Karachi to Basrah and may need the use of these stations. We are sending a copy of this letter to France at the India Office and perhaps he will bo good enough to let us havo the views of the Government of India on this aspect. If there are no strong objections on political grounds to B.O.A.C.’s evacuation of Sharjah the R.A.F. would have to make their own arrangements for the manning of the station and this change from civil to military status would presumably require the negotiation of a nev; agreement or at any rate a very clear understanding with the Sheikh of Sharjah, Before we discuss this possibility with the Air iiinistry we shall be grateful for an expression of the Foreign Office and India Office views from the political angle. It should, however, be borne in mind that in the event of it being thought desirable that the station should continue to be maintained by B.O.A.C. there would be very real practical difficulties in doing so in view of its isolated position if no service regularly operated there. I am sending copies of this letter to Warran at the Air Ministry as well as to France of the India Office. Yours sincerely. N.J.A.Cheetham, Esq., Foreign Office, Downing Street, lr # X.l.India Office, Whitehall, London, S#W*1* Ext.4539/46. U July » 1946 * Dear Jones, , Would you please refer to your letter to Cheetham No•R* 138 ^ 1 - 8/46 of 25th June about air facilities at Sharjah and Dubai* 2* Prom the political angle y/o should wish to consult the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India before giving a definite answer on the points raised, and for this purpose a firmer indication of the Air Ministry’s views would be desirable. Our provisional views, however, are as follows (a) Under our agreements with the Sheikhs the only State or Government which is entitled to conclude an Air Agreement with either Sharjah or Dubai is His Majesty’s Government* (b) As regards Dubai, if neither B*0*A*C* nor the R.A*P. nor the Government of India have any further requirements for facilities there, it would seem that the Air Agreement should be terminated* (c) As regards Sharjah it would perhaps be preferable in order to avoid the accusation that we were establishing an R.A.F* base there, for the facilities required by the R.A*P* to be covered by a Civil Air Agreement in the present form even if the continuing civil air requirements were only a small proportion of those of the R.A.F* and the aerodrome were manned by the R*A*F* In that case, however, the Agreement would probably require some modifications o*g* the references to B*0*A*C. might be replaced by references to 'H.M.G* or their agents'* 3* As regards the future requirements of Indian civil air lines at Sharjah and Dubai, wo are asking the Government of India whether they can give us any information about this. 4* I am sending copies of this letter to Warren and Cheetham* Yours sincerely, - ' ' F.

You will remember that the Sharjah Air Agreement has recently been renewed for 10 years. The following passage from the Agreement appears to be relevant to the present question:- 'I will construct a rest house for the passengers and staff of the Corporation on a site to be selected by the Corporation and in accordance with plans drawn up by them and under the supervision of an engineer of the British Government, The house and fixed fittings to be considered as ray property.'

Regional Director for the Iraq and Persian Gulf area. This was the first indication we had of the survey and we were, in fact, unaware that any difficulty was being experienced with the alighting area at Dibai due to silting. We therefore wrote to the Corporation on the receipt of your letter asking for some further details and have now received their reply, which I am afraid does not carry us any further. It appears that the Regional Director has been concerned for some time at the gradual silting up of the Creek and in the absence of the Corporation*s expert on other duties, engaged the services of Mr. 'Whitteron to make a survey of the alighting area.

You will notice that, except for the demand for an aerial photograph, the report is non-committal. f'his is not surprizing in view of the fact that it is based on date obtained only from about forty lead-soundings and one day*s inspection. At the same time, there can be no quarrel with his conclusions, that the slltlAg of ^he sea-bar constitutes a serious and direct menace to the prosperity of the town and that the Hattai Bank and the silting caused by the jeti-y nay between then ruin the alighting area in the not too distant future. 3. I have discussed the question at length with Captain hite, who is an ex-master mariner of experience and was associated with V hitteron whan 'Uie latter was inspecting the creek. As a result, it is my duty to bring the following points to your notice. 4. In general, water and tides are tricky things and their behavior in these parts is complicated by the strong winds that are so prevalent. This being so, it is quite possible that the proposed spurs aay produce most unfortunate results. No doubt they will divert the ebb tide over the Hattai Bank and in time wash away at least part of it. But this silt must go somewhere and a shown by the pencilled arrows, it may tend to fill up the nrcsent deep water channel. Furthermore, a diversion, as proposed, of the direction of the ebb tide ray cause a deposit of silt from, the Daira shallow© in the deep water opposite Jray Mackenzie's building* The Hattai bank is already 2 feet out of water at low tide and only about 18 inches under it at high tide. It is doubtful if the spurs would ever make it deeper than 3 or 4 feet at high water and therefore /• Major K.G.&amp;.

Dear Weightman, When 1 was at Sharjah the Shaikh asked me whether it would be possible to have his Khor dredged by a small dredger, and said that he would be prepared to meet the expenses up to a reasonable amount* it appears that within living memory the Khor has been as deep as 6 or 7 fathoms, and if it could be restored to its former depth he would, of course, be able to accommodate very much larger country craft in a completely sheltered anchorage* 2. i am asking the Port Director at Basra whether there is any likelihood of a small dredger being available, but in the meantime i would be glad if you would send this plan to howes and ask him to let me have an estimate of the greatest possible straight length that ban be included without great labour in the direction of l.*#2 and i would be glad if he would also discover whether there is or is not a deeper channel at 4, since the Captain of the 'IMearchus’ 1 suggested that the reason for the silting up of the rthor might possibly have been an obstruction about this place preventing the free flow of the tide through the lagoon* if the Port Director considers there is some possibility of a dredger being available, i v/ill then take up the question with the Air Officer Commanding, iravi, since it would obviously be of the greatest value to have the flying boat base here and not at Debai• 3. i enquired from the Residency Agent whether the Shaikh would be able to contribute substantially towards this enter prise, and he thought he would be prepared to spend up to a lakh if he thought that the Khor could be definitely improved, his idea being to invest his oil money in something that would befiefit him permanently 6 iours sincerely, sd.

Deal' Sir John, While at Sharjah, the Shaikh raised the question O' the dredging of his Khor, which has silted up within living memory from about 6 or 7 fathoms to under l fathjorn. i askea the Commander of the 'Nearchus' whether it would be possible to give any estimate of the cost, since the Khor appeared to have a sandy bottom throughout, and he stated that witnout knowing whether a dredger could or could not be made availaole for the purpose it would be useless to attempt to max^e an}’ calculations which would require some little time. 2. Could you very kindly let me know whether you see any possibility during the summer of being able to spare a small dredger suitable for this work, and if so v/hat the cost would be likely to be per diem ? if there is any likelihood of its being available at a price witnin the Shaikh's means, i would get into touch with tne Air Authorities to discover whether they would contribute to the dredging operations, since it appears to the lay eye that an alternative and very valuable anchorage for flying boats could be made here without much expenditure, and one, moreover, which would have the immense advantage of being both near the existing land aerodrome on this coast and o r giving a take-off in two directions more or less at right angles.

Proia what he says i am afraid that the project does not sound very hopeful, though i suppose it is just conceivable that if the mouth of the Khor were dredged the resultant scour might clean up the sand-banks on line 1 to 2» 3 , It is however to be remembered that our agreevaent with Dubai still has 3 years and 8 months to run. i do not think that we can get out of the payments called for in that agreement and consequently i imagine the Air Ministry would not be interested in Sharjah for some considerable time to come. lours sincerely sd. H.Weightman The Hobble Lieut.-Col.C.G.Prior, CIK., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire:P note on the suitability of Sharjah Greek as an alighting area. 1. Reference is to the Nearchus sketch of the whole creek, and to the two enlarged sketches of the stretches marked 1-2 and 1-3 on it. The two latter are freehand and can be taken as approximate only. They show the state of the creek at lov/ v/ater ordinary springs. Depths are in feet. 2. 1 think that a glance at the sketch will be sufficient to show the unsuitability of stretch 1-2. it is nowhere deepj and, to get a straight run, one would have to cut through the sandbank off the petrol store • it v/ould also be necessary to clear the L-shaped sandbank opposite Sharjah tov/n. But the effects of the dredging would not kxx be permanent, as the tidal stream v/ould always tend to follov/ the outside of the bend; and the eddy set up on the ebb by the rocks opposite Sharjah tov/n would tend to reform the L-shaped sandbank. 3. The stretch 1-3 shov/s better depth of v/ater, but does not give a long enough run for a flying boat. The channel is very narrow, and though wide enough to land in for most of its length, v/ould not allow a plane to turn round. The bottle neck opposite the southern end of the lov/ hill would require considerable widening, it lies almost plumb across the prevailing wind, which is here west .North west. 4. The place marked 4 on the Nearchus sketch has no channel at all. it is the watershed between the two creeks, and can be crossed on foot, if one goes carefully, for about two hours on either side of lov; v/ater. it is filled with a sort of black slime consisting of sand and rotted seaweed . sd.

In any case a survey would have to be made to ascertain whether one of the Port dredgers could get into the place and for estimates of cost to be made . If the Khor has silted up so rapidly it would appear that the place would have to be dredged every fev/ years, i do not therefore think it is a practical proposition.

In January 1939 the Station Superintendent,, Imperial Airways, at Sharjah enquired from the Residency Agent whether Imperial Airv/ays had the right to recover the customs duty levied by the Shaikh of Dubai on fuel and oil imported into Dubai for their aircraft. The suggestion was made that this was a new charge. The Residency Agent reported that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who supply the needs of Imperial Airways, had always in the past paid customs charges at the rate of 1.75 as. per tin of four gallons of petrol imported into Dubai, ana this charge was paid equally on petrol imported for Imperial Airways. The customs schedule in Dubai had been recently revised and the charge had now become Rs.2—6-C per cent ad valorem, the actual cost being i.l4 as. per tin of four gallons i.e. a reduction of 7t ps.

Secret Dear Gibson, Will you please refer to the Dabai Civil Air Agreement, copy of which was ‘forwarded to the Air Ministry under India Office printed letter PZ.4168/38 of the 17th June, 1938. We have received a claim from Imperial Airways (now the British Overseas Airv/ays Corporation) for the refund of charges paid by them in respect of duty and taxes - at the rate of Rs. 2.6.0$ - on fuel supplied at Dabai from March, 1939 to August, 1939. (So far no claims have been received for refund of duty on oil). Under the terms of Clause 18(i)(a) of the Empire Agree ment, we shall have to allow the Corporation’s claim. Hitherto, we had been under the impression that freedom from customs duty on fuel was granted at Dabai although the Agreement with the Shaikh contains no clause to this effect. You will no doubt recollect that the Sharjah Agreement, on the other hand, contains a clause permitting the Company the right to import free of duty, petrol etc. required for their services. We understand from the Corporation that their Accountant at Alexandria has endeavoured to obtain a J.P. Gibson, Esq., India House, Whitehall, London, S.W.l.4 &lt; * ^ * refund of the duties charged at Dabai but without success and, furthermore, a letter received frgm, their Iraq Area Manager indicates that the Political Agent, Bahrein, upholds the imposition of the duty. We should be glad, therefore, if you would ascertain the facts in this connection and, if the reported attitude of the Political Agent is confirmed, whether there are political reasons which render advisable the continued payment of this duty on fuel. If no such reasons exist, perhaps you would consider whether a clause - similar to the one in the Sharjah Agreement referred to above — could be added to the Dabai Agreement which, as you know, does not terminate until 21st July, 1943.

AIR MINISTRY, ARIEL HOUSE, STRAND, LONDON, 7 + W.C. 2. 24th May, 1939. Dear Gibson, Thank you for your letter of 18th May, P.Z.2891/39, enclosing copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about Dubai. I aril sorry we have been so long in writing to you regarding the outcome of the Meeting held on 19th January with reference to fuelling facilities at Ras-el-Khaimah. You will recall that one of the recommendations was that the wireless set should in time of emergency be moved from the launch at Dubai and installed in a motor van for transport to Ras-el-Khaimah. The technical difficulties have proved more serious than was anticipated and a considerable number of enquii'ios have had to be made. At present Imperial Airways are looking into the possibility of using a pack wireless set on a van instead of the set from the launch. The second conclusion reached at the Meeting was that the Company^ fuel launch should be stationed at Sharjah instead of Dubai so that it could easily be transferred to Ras-el-Khaimah. Galpin of Imperial Airways has, however. Just written in to say that during the last disturbance at Dubai the Company’s Station Superintendent at Sharjah received the following wireless message from the Station Superintendent at Bahrein:- '•Political Agent advises you may attend services Ras-el-Khaimah, but you must return Sharjah every night. No launches or refuelling launch may proceed from Dubai to Ras-el-Khaimah. u He adds that at the time when the disturbance broke out tide! conditions made the road to Ras-el-Khairaah impassable, nt Poli'kic&amp;l reasons it is impossible to transfer the launches to Ras-el-Khaimah in the event of trouble at Dubai J.P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, S.W.l.j ■‘ ivK. . Jt AjLASLJjL %o4X* £j? ; the circumstances are somewhat different from those on which the Meeting last January based its recommendations. If the presence of launches at Ras-el-Khaimah is objected to, possibly the use of a wireless set on a lorry would be equally objectionable. , . Apart from the question of wireless, which could either be taken to Ras-el-Khaimah on the control launch or if it were not possible to move the control launch from Dubai on a motor van,the Company maintain that refuelling , from the Royal Air Force dhow at Ras-el-Khaimah would be extremely difficult without the aid of the small launch. Galpin also mentioned that the moorings which had been laid at Ras-el-Khaimah have broken loose (the question of moorings was not discussed at the meeting in January and we were not aware that they had been laid), and he asks whether there would be any objection to replacing them. Would you be good enough to obtain the advice of the Political Resident on this point. We hope to be able to give you a definite reply shortly regarding the practicability of using ^ wireless on a motor van, but meantime will you please consider asking the Political Resident for his views on the necessity of obtaining permission from the Sheikh to put into effect the proposals made at the Meeting, the details of which we have been consider ing. If he is of the opinion that these proposals would involve an approach to the Sheikh, it may be that we should want to amplify our plans a little ; since they were originally framed with the distinct object of'making a new agreement with the Sheikh unnecessary, at the same time satisfying the bare minimum of operational requirements.

(Seci’etary) The Chairman recapitulated as follows the events leading up to Imperial Airways recent request for the provision of certain facilities at Ras—al-Khaimah. At a meeting held at the Air Ministry in April last, attended by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, it had been decided that Debai should continue to be used as a scheduled stopping place, but that in the event of trouble with the Sheikh preventing the use of Debaij the aircraft would land instead for refuelling at Ras-al-Khaimah about 50 miles distant. Since the agreement with the Sheikh allowed only one barge to be moored off his shore, the consent of the R.A.P. had been obtained fop the Company to draw fuel and oil from the R.A.P. dhow, which is permanently stationed there, subject to requirements of the Service. Disadvantages of this arrangement were that the bulk of the fuel stored in the dhow was D.T.D.224, only a*rmm small stock of D.T.D.230, v/hicli is essential for the Empire flying boats, being held, and that the permission of the Air Staff had to be obtained on every occasion that the Company wished to draw on their supplies. at Debai, and acting on the advice of the Political Agent, the Company, at short notice, were obliged to cancel their landings at Debai and arrange to refuel from the R.A.F. dhow at Ras-al- Khaimah; the control launch containing a wireless set was moved from Debai to Ras-al-Khaimah where it remained for about 10 days until the trouble blew over. The Chairman said that he understood that Imperial Airways were dissatisfied with the existing arrangements in the light of their experience during that period, and were now making fresh proposals to cover possible future emergencies. remarks and said that correspondence which had taken place between the Company's Area Manager and the Political Agent subsequent to the October disturbances at Debai led him to thin that in the event of future trouble suddenly breaking out at Debai it might be impossible for the control launch to pass out of the creek there and proceed to Ras-al-Khaimah. The Company’s Station Superintendent at Sharjah on the occasion on the very first hint of trouble and had been able to get the launch clear from Debai, but future disturbances might commence so suddenly that similar action would not be possible and a very serious situation would in consequence result. In the light of their previous experience Commander Galpin said he had come to the conclusion, after full consideration, that the situation could best be met by (l) obtaining permission from the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah to station a small refuellinp; launch (belonging to the company) there, and (2) to erect temporarily on shore a wireless set to be transported by road Last October disturbances broke out without warnin-'; Commander Galpin confirmed the Chairman’s opening of the last disturbance at Debai acted on his own initiative-3- from Sharjah, should it be found impossible to transfer the control launch from Debai. Commander Galpin explained with regard to (1) that owing to the shape and the mooring position of the R.A.F. dhow - near the bank - at Ras-al-Khaimah it was found to be very awkward to refuel the aircraft, which were unable to taxf up to the dhow; the Company during the last emergency had been able to get their small refuelling launch containing a 500 gallon tank up to Ras-al-Khaimah from Sharjah and used it instead of the dhowo The R.A.F. flying boats, which occasionally refuelled direct from the dhow were not operating to schedule in the same sense as the Company’s aircraft, with which time was an all-important factor. Discussion ensued on the possibility of trouble breaking out without prior warning, and Air I'inistry representa tives pointed out that in this event neither the fuel launch nor the control launch might be got av/ay from Debai. Commander Galrin agreed and emphasized that it was for that reason he had recommended holding a spare portable wireless set at Sharjah which could be transported by road. The alight ing area at Debai was in a lagoon, with a bar at the entrance and opposing factions took up their stance on opposite sides. The lagoon was, therefore, directly in the line of fire. The Chairman suggested that there would be opportuni ties during quiet spells for getting the launches away. In reply, Mr. Wheelan said that trouble might 'boil up” slowly at first but it would then keep on. He pointed out that the launches could not be got out at all states of the tide nor at night. There might therefore be only one suitable time each day; furthermore although the townsmen might respect the launches the tribesmen were unlikely to do so. Regarding the proposed transport of a W/T set by road, L/Silr Drummond asked f:r. Wheelan’s opinion as to the suitabilityr* of tlie road between Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah, and whether he had made use of it at different times of the year, kr. Wheela n ^ stated that he had used the road in October and December v/hen weather conditions were none too good, but he thought it was always passable to motor vehicles except perhaps when the tide was in. In answer to Mr. Riddoch , he said that the Company’s motor van would be used to.transport the 'V/T set from Sharjah and batteries would also be carried. He thought there was little fear of molestation on the road to Ras-al-Khaimah for, in his opinion, the tribes would be unlikely to combine. ' The Chairman pointed out how undesirable it would be to have to reopen negotiations with the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, and asked if the ’V/T proposal under discussion would involve the making of new arrangements with the Sheikh. hr. G-ibson said that he was not sure whether the proposed arrangements, would involve a fresh approach to 'the Sheikh; the 1930 agreement, which was still regarded as valid, provided mainly • for the protection of the fuel barge and aircraft landing at Ras-al-Khaimah; any new proposals involving for example the erection of structures would, he thought, necessitate negotiat ing a new agreement with the Sheikh. Mr. Wheelan, as a result of his experience last October, thought the Sheikh would raise no objection to any temporary arrangements which might be made, such as for example W/T working from the van. Commander Galpin , in answer to Mr. Riddoch , confirmed that, in the opinion of his Company, communication between Ras-al- Khaimah and Sharjah was essential, if the former place were being used instead of Debai as a stopping place. He explained the system of communication in the area and mentioned that all political information originated in Sharjah, where incidentally, the Residency Agent lived. Responsibility for diverting air craft would be taken by the Station Superintendent if it were too late for the issue of such instructions by the Company’s Manager at Baghad. Provision of a land line between Ras-al~(S&gt; -5- Khaimah and Sharjah would, of course, he the ideal solution for the Company, but the distance involved, over 50 miles, and the impossibility of protecting such a line put this out of the question. In amplification of Commander Galpin T 3 remarks, Mr, Wheelan explained that differences in weather conditions at Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah made communication between the flying boat and Ras-al-Khaimah essential; for example, there might be a fog at Sharjah and not at Ras-al-Khaimah, or vice versa. T he Chairman pointed out that in respect of other emergency stopping places on the Empire Air mail route, no provision was made for wireless; it appeared to be recognised in principle therefore that for short emergencies of less than say 24 hours duration wireless could be dispensed v/ith a V.'hat we were considering here was an emergency,subsisting over a longer period say for a week or so* Was there no way, at an early stage of the emergency, of borrowing a wireless set from some where in the neighbourhoolV W/Cdr. Deacon suggested that the best and most economical — —. - - ■ - - m arrangement would he to take out the W/T set from the launch, instal it in the van as a mobile station and send the van on by road to Ras-al-Khaimah if an emergency arose which prevented transfer of the control launch* The only items required in addition would be two 24 volt batteries (or four 12 volt car batteries), a portable mast, and aerial wire. Commander Cal.pin though this suggestion might prove to be a solution to the Y//T problem. The question then arose whether at the worst the Company could dispense with their small fuel launch for refuelling at Ras-al-Khe.imaho ht. Commander Drummond suggested that if that launch were based at Sharjah instead of Debai, it could always be got away to Ras-al-Khaimah if needed there*. Comm a nde r Galpin thought that this also was a practicable suggestion* The Chairman invited him to investigate the possibility of these- 6 - wae then considered. G-ibson , while of the opinion that no new agreement would be necessary, said that the Political Resident ought to be informed of the arrangements proposed, to give him an opportunity of stating whether the matter•should be broached to the Sheikh or not. hr. Wheelan mentioned that in the course of a conversa tion which he recently had at Sharjah with Capt. Howes, the Assistant Political Agent, the latter stated very definitely that it would be inadvisable to have any discussion with the Sheikh on these matters. Mr. Riddoch referred to the Company’s expressed intentjon to apply for Ras-al-Khaimah to be included in the Fourth Schedule of the Empire Agreement as an optional stopping place. The Chairman suggested that such an application would now be unnecess ary in view of the arrangements which wouold result from this meeting. Commander Galpin , hov/ever, thought that the Company would prefer to make the proposed application in view of the fact that the use of Ras-al-Khaimah was forced on them by-the political situation in that neighbourhood - a matter outside their control. He therefore proposed to apply for Ras-al-Khaimah to be scheduled as an alternative stopping place to Debai. I,r. Rahy said that the financial objection was that the Company had come to regard the scheduling of a stopping place as implying the provision of a recognised standard of facilities there. Ras-al-Khaimah v/as not intended to he an alternative to Debai in the sense that it was optional to the Company to land at one or the other. It was an emergency halt to be used only when landings at Debai were impossible. Commander Galpin said he v/ouid consider the points which had been made, but he thought the Company would prefer to see Ras-al-Khaimah officially recognised, as there was no alternative if Debai v/as out of action. The Company would be prepared to use Ras-al-Khaimah on the terms mentioned, which would be confirmed by official correspondence. The Chairman/ -7- pointed out that the agreement provided for the use of places not on the Schedule in the case of emergency, ^ In reply to the Chairman, Commander Galpin agreed to investigate the possibility of:- (l) moving the W/T set from the launch at Debai, in the event of emergency, and installing it in the Company’s van for use as a mobile station at Ras-al-Khaimah. (g) basing the Company’s fuel launch on Sharjah instead of Debai so that it could easily be transferred to Ras- al-Khaimah, (3) drawing fuel from the R.A.F. stocks at Ras-al-Khaimah and replacing it from the Company’s stocks at Sharjah, as was done before, and to arrange for an official letter to be sent to the Air Ministry outlining the Company’s proposals. S/bdr, Cade11 asked how much fuel would be required by the Company and how long they would take to replace it. In reply, Commander Qalpin said they would require about 400 galls for each aircraft landing; he thought that the maintenance of a reserve stock of about 1,500 gallons of D.T.D. 230 grade fuel would suffice for the Company's needs fop the period which they aimed to cover. The stock used could be replaced from Sharjah in about a day. ! r. Wheelan thought that it might be possible to send supplies of fuel from Sharjah to Ras-al-Khaimah by road.\ ! jcP &lt; S- Tel.

The Company’s Station Superintendent at Sharjah on the occasion of the last disturbance at Pebai acted on his own initiative on the very first hint of trouble and had been able to get the launch clear from ;&gt;ebai but future disturbances might commence so auddaiy permission of the Air taff had to be obtained on Oo.ufian-ier Calpln confirmed the Chairman’sthat sjUallar action would not be possible and a very serious situation would in consequence r suit* In the light of their preyi me experience o imanq-r Galpin said he had come to the conclusion, after full consideration, that the situation could best be met by (1) obtaining permission fro^i the oheikh of }aa-al-Khaimah to station a small refuelling launch (belonging to the coraj^any) there, and (2) to erect temporarily on shore a wireless set to be transported by road from Sharjah, should it be f und impos ible to transfer the control launch from Debel* (1) that owing to the shape and the mooring position of the K.A.F. dhow - near the bank - at fcas-al-Khai mh it was found to be yory awkward to refuel the aircraft, which were unable to taxi up to the dhow* the Company during the last emergency had been able to get their small refuelling launch containing a 600 gallon tank up to Kas-al-Khaimah fro.i Sharjah and used it instead of the dhow* Th R.A.F* flying boats, which occasionally refuelled direct from the dhow were not operating to schedule In the same sense as the Company's aircraft, with which time was an all- important factor* trouble bre iking out without prior warning, and Air Ministry representatives pointed out that in this event neither the fuel launch nor the control launch might be got away from Debai. Com gander GaIpin agreed and emphasized that it was for that reason he ha recommended holding a spare portable wireless set at Sharjah which could be transported by road. The Commander Galpln explained with regard to Discussion ensued on the possibility of / a#* alighting area was in a lagoon, with a bar at the entrance, and opposing factions took up their stanceon opposite sides* The lagoon was, therefore, directly in the line of fire* ^ ^he ;halrgian suggested that there would ::&gt;e opportunities during quiet spells for getting the launches away* In reply, U r* theolan said that trouble might “boil up' slowly at first but it would then keep on* pointed out that the launches could only be got out at high tide and in daylight* There might therefore be only one suitable time each day* furthermore although the townsmen might respect the launches the tribesmen were unlikely to do so* Regarding the proposed transport of a w/T set by road, .Ji'Ca- ivomonfl asked Ur. ..heelan’s opinion as to the suitability of the road between Sharjah and Eas-a2~Khalm&amp;h, and whether he had made use of it at different times of the year* ;:r* .heelan stated that he had used the road in October and December when weather conditions were none too good, but he thought it was always pesoable to motor vehicles except perhaps when the tide was in* In answer to r* id oc , he said that t...c Caipany 1 * .note van v/oule be used to transport the w/T set from Sharjah and batteries would also be carried. He thought there was little fear of molestation on the road to Rao~al~Khaimah fox*, in his opinion, the tribes would be unlihely to combine* The OhalpL-ian pointed out how undesirable it would be to have to reopen negotiations with the Sheikh of f as-al-Khaizaah* and asked if the w/T proposal under discussion would Involve the making of new arrangements with the Sheikh* Mr* Gibson said that he was not sure cuv&lt;x^^v~*^JU whether the proposed [method of transportJwould involve a fresh approach to the -iheikh; the 1950 agreement, whichwas still regarded as valla, provided mainly for the protection of the fuel barge and aircraft landing at Ras-al-Khalmahj any new proposals Involving for exauple the erection of structures would, he thought, necessitate negotiating a new agreement with the Sheikh. Lr . he el an as a result of his experience last October, thought the Sheikh would raise no objection to any temporary arrangements which might be made, such as for exaiaple W/T working from the van. OQi.tLiunder uulijlit , in answer to ;.ir. .laaoch. confirmed that communication between Ras-al-Khaimah and Sharjah was essential, if the foner place were being used instead of Debal as a stopping place. lie explained the system of cot&amp;iunioatlon in the area and mentioned that all politioal information originated in Sharjah, where incidentally, the Political /.gent lived. Responsibility for diverting aircraft would be taken by the Station Superintendent if it were too late for the issue of such instructions by the company’s Manager at Bagrfad. Provision of a land line between Has -a 1-Kha inah and Sharjah would, of course, be the ideal solution for the Company, but the distance involved over 60 miles, and the ic^possibility of protecting suoh a line put this out of the question. In amplification of commander Galpin’s remarks, : r. .heelan explained that differences in weather conditions at Sharjah and Has -a 'hainah made communication between the flying boat and Ras-al-Khairoah essential* for example, there might be a fog at Sharjah and not at Ras-al-Khaimah or vice versa. Xte Cte.lman pointed out that in respect of other emergency stopping places on the Kmpire Air mail route, no provision was made for wireless; it appearedIt to be principle therefore thet for short emergencies of leas than say 24 hours duration wireless could be dispensed with. 1 hat we were considering here was an eoergencyoubsisting over a longer period say for a week or so. Was there no way, at an early stage of the emergency, of borrowing a wireless set from somewhere in the neighbourhood. ,/Cdr. ^eacon suggested that the best and most economical arrange? *ent would be to take out the W/T set from the launch, inst 1^ it in t e van as a mobile station and send the van on by road to ims-al-'hainaK if an emergency arose which prevented transfer of the control launch. The only itei^s required in addition would be two sets of 24 volt car batteries (or four 12 volt sets), a portable mast, and aerial wire. Jpomander Palp in though this suggestion might prove to be a solution to the W/T problem. The question then arose whether at the worst the Company could dispense with their small fuel launch for refuelling at Ras-al-Khaimah. Lt.Commander ^rumuond suggested that if thet launch were based at Sharjah instead of Debai, it could always be got away to ias-al-.ihalmeii, if needed there. Corxiandcr Galoin thought that this also was a practicable suggestion. The Chairman invited him to investigate the possibility of these arrangements. The necessity for any further approach to the Sheikh was then considered. ur. (&gt;i son , while of the opinion that no new agreement would be necessary said that the Political Resident ought to be informed of the arrangejoents proposed, to give him an opportunity of stating whether the matter should be broached to the bheikh or not.(S Mr. T/h©elan mentioned that in the course of a - ' a4* Ca^6»jC*» onversation which he recently had/with ttr. Howes, the assistant Political Agent at tihuijntr, the latter stated very definitely that it would be inadvisable to have any discussion with the Sheikh on these matters. Mr. Riddoch referred to the Company’s expressed intention to apply for Has—al—Khaimah to be included in the Fourth Schedule of the Stapire Agreement as an optional stopping place. The Chaii&gt;i ,an suggested that such an application would now be unnecessary in view of the arrangements which would result from this meeting. upomander Galpln . however, thought that the Company would prefer to make the proposed application in view of the fact that the use of lias-al-Khahash was forced on them by the political situation in that neighbourhood - a matter outside their control. He therefore proposed to apply for Ras^al-^Khaimah to be scheduled as an alternative stopping place to Debpi. lir. ilaby said that bU. the financial objection was that^Coe^any had come to regard the scheduling of a stopping place as implying the provision of a recognised standard of facilities there. Rae-al-Kh&amp;imah was not intended to be an alternative to Debai in the sense that it was optional to the Company to land at one or the other. It was aa energency halt to be used only when landings at Debai were impossible. Jomaander Galpin said he would consider the points which had been made, but he thought the company would prefer to see Ras-al-Khaimah officially recoilsed, as there was no alternative if Debai was out of action. The Company would be prepared to use Ri^al-Khalmah on the terms mentioned^which would be confirmed by official correspondence. The -..■hair.,an pointed out thatthe aereement provided for the uee of places not on the Schedule in the case of eiiergenoy. In reply to the Chairunn, . omunaer Unloln agreed to investigate the possibility oft- (1) moving the W/T set from the launch at Debai, in the event of emergency, and ins tailing It in t e dompany's van for use as a mobile station at Haa-al-Iliuimah. (2) basing t e Company's fuel launch on Sharjah instead of Debal so that it could easily be transferred to Ras-ul-hhaimah. (3) Drawing fuel from the R.A*P. stocks at Has-al^KhaJuaah and replacing it from the company's stocks at &gt;harjah f as was done before# and to arrange for an official letter to be sent to the . t ir Ministry dl^Lining t e Corapi ny's proposals. : /^dr. j-adell aekod how much fuel would be required by the camx^any and how long they would take to replace it. In reply, Comander h l^Xn said they would require about 400 galls for each aircraft landing; he thought tliat the maintenance of a reserve stock of about 1500 gtillons of D.T.D. 230 grade fuel would suffice for the company's needs for the period which they aimed to cover.

It was decided at that meeting that Imperial Airways should continue to use Dubai as a regular stopping place and that Ras-el-Kaimah should be regarded as an emergency alighting area. Since that meeting the Royal Air Force have been asked to keep a reserve stock of fuel for Imperial Airways in their dhow at Ras-el-Kaimah. The arrangements have not yet been completed as several complications have arisen but the Royal Air Force are, at the moment, considering hiring a larger dhow. The objection of Imperial Airways to hiring a barge of their own in which to keep a reserve of fuel was that an agreement with the Sheikh of Ras-el-Kaimah would be necessary, and we understood that it was the opinion of Sir Trenchard Fowle that an agreement could be dispensed with if the Company obtained their fuel from the Royal Air Force. You will note, however, in the attached copy of a letter dated 5th July from Commander Galpin of Imperial Airways, the suggestion that a permit from the Sheikh of Ras-el-Kaimah woufc be necessary before their flying boats could safely alight there. We should like to avoid opening negotiations with the Sheikh if possible.

I agree that as far as the provision of watch towers is concerned we should do better for the present time to postpone that proposal. At yesterday’s meeting it was confirmed that the payment of the Rs.940 per month will not be a charge to us, and I think it was left with the Air Ministry to discover whether the site for the passenger shelter could be between high and low water, or whether it must be further out into the creek than low tide level. I am referring the agreement to those interested here, and will forward to you any comments they may wish to make, but prima facie I have no other comments. Consequent upon the possibility of trouble at Dubai, there arises the question of the necessary permission for us to alight in emergency at Ras-el-Kaimah. I had understood previously that the Political Resident and the India Office did not think it necessary for any application under this head to be made to the Sheikh of Ras-el-Kaimah, but I took the opportunity of the visit of cur Baghdad Manager to arrange a meeting between him and Mr. Symon, of the India Office. x The result of that meeting was that it was de cided that it was necessary for us to have the permission - of' - the ~ Sheikh of Ras-el-Kaimah for our flying boats to alight there in emergency and to refuel from the R.A.E.dhow.

For the present (and it is understood for some years to come) it will he necessary for the flying boats operating on the Empire air mail route to make a night stop in the Persian Gulf. Pending the result of an Admiralty survey at Umm al Qaiwain, Imperial Airways decided, in May 1937, to use Debai for this purpose, since advantage can be taken of the existing accommodation at Sharjah, 7 miles away. Negotiations were accordingly opened with the Sheikh of Debai, and on 22nd July 1937 an Agreement was executed, by which the Sheikh agreed to provide the required facilities at a rental of Rs.440 a month, excluding the rent for any buildings which might be required. The final clause of the Agreement runs as follows:- 'This Agreement will be for a temporary period of one year in the first instance and may be extended for any further period to be agreed upon later, on condition that these terms remain unaltered. ' In February last information was received to the effect that the Sheikh was not prepared to erect the buildings required himself, but that Imperial Airways could do so themselves, provided that the labour and materials were obtained from the Sheikh, and that he was paid a monthly rental for the sites required of Rs. 1,000 . A month later the Political Resident reported that, arising out of the recent disturbances at Debai, the Sheikh had indicated that he was not prepared to renew the Air Agreement. Simultaneously/Simultaneously a memorandum was received from the Resident, in which he expressed his personal view that there were serious objections to the continued use of Debai by Imperial Airways, and suggesting that the question of utilising either Ras-al-Khaimah or Umm-al- Qaiwain as an alternative site should be considered. Such was the situation when the Resident came home on deputation at the end of March, and at the suggestion of the Air Ministry a meeting was held (on 13th April) to consider the matter. After hearing technical arguments for and against the use of the 3 possible sites, it was agreed that Imperial Airways should continue at Debai and that Ras-al-Khaimah should be used in emergency should the question of the safety of their service at Debai arise on any occasion. Sir Trenchard Fowle entirely agreed with this decision, and at the request of the Air Ministry he has now been authorised to commence negotiations with the Sheikh of Debai for a new Agreement extending over a period of 5 years on the best terms available. The Air Ministry (and Imperial Airways, recognise that in order to obtain a new Agreement it may be necessary to considerably increase the existing terras, and the Resident has been given a free hand (up to a maximum of Rs. 1,000 a month, including the present payment of Rs.440 a month).

Repeated toi His Majesty* a Secretary of State for India, V India Office, London. Secretary to the Government of India in the Kxternal Affairs Department, Simla. In continuation of my telegram No. 105 dated the 7th JUne 1938« Civil Air Agreement at Dubai. 2. I enclose herewith a copy of the Agreement to which I ob tained the Shaikh of Dubai’s acceptance. It will be observed that, except for essential changes, it follows the wording of the present temporary Agreement as closely as possible, this having been found necessary in order to d isarm suspicion in Dubai and hence to prevent the delay that at one time seemed inevitable in obtaining the Agreement. It will be appreciated that such a delay would have the certain effect of an increase in the rental demands, since it would have given an opportunity for the 'hostile” elements council in the Shaikh* s Jamah to increase their pressure on him. For simi lar reasons I found it necessary to insert the new clause No. 6 at the urgent request of the Shaikh. This clause will not lead to any disadvantage from our point of view, and indeed it has some advantage in e stabllshlng in a written agreement the principle of Joint Jurisdiction in one of the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms. Finally, since it was essential to obtain the Shaikh's signature on the rough/-rough draft in order to prevent any aitempt to increase de mands in the interval before the signature of the final ap proved copy| I found it necessary to attach my own signature and thus to some extent to commit His Hajesty 1 s Government to the acceptance of this draft. I trust that this action *ill be approved. There was considerable opposition in Dubai to the renewal of the Agreement at all except on the most exorbitant terms, and it was only as a result of very strong pressure that the Shaikh was Induced to sign an Agreement which, after allowing for the cost of guards, obtains an alighting area with provision for the structures required at a monthly rent of Hs. 600/-. 3. It is, I think, unnecessary to describe in detail the progress of the negotiations. It will be sufficient to say that it was evident at the outset that the Shaikh had been subjected tovery considerable pressure by certain of his advisers, and in particular by his wife, to d emand not less but considerably more than the rental of Hs. 1000/- per men sem (exclusive of guards) which has been his original figure some months ago. In mobilising more favourable Influences I received the utmost assistance from Than Sahib Syed Abdur Rezzaq, the Residency Agent at Sharjah, to whose efforts the final outcome is largely due. 4. Although It is not definitely so stated in paragraph 1(b) of the draft Agreement, it is clearly understood between the Shaikh and myself that the passenger shelter and store, as well as the sheds for the motor launches, will be attached to the jetty itself and will not be constructed on the land. 5. In regard to the question of more permanent arrangements for the safe conduct of passengers between Dubai and Sharjah, my opinion is that the construction of watch towers with per manent guards stationed in them is unnecessary and must inevitably/-inevitably lead o vastly increased demands from both Shaikhs t which it might be difficult to resist* For practical pur poses the fact that guards travel in one of the passenger cars is fully adequate* These cars have been travelling between Sharjah and Dubai for many months with Imperial Air ways* personnel 9 andjfor some time now with passengers* In that time there have been no incidents* Since journeys are performed not infrequently in the dark it is arguable that the carriage of guards in the cars should be more ef ectlve than location of men in watch to ere* The passage of these cars moreover between Sharjah and Dubai is now accepted lo cally as part of the normal incident of dally life, and I suggest it will do mors harm than good to put into the local mind the idea that we ourselves entertain ao(prehensions and that as we appear to expect trouble it would be well that we should not bs disappointsdl It is of course impossible to guarantee that there will never be incidents! but my own strong feeling is that the posting of permanent guards in watch towers is not calculated in any way to add to security* Finally a serious attack on the cars is unlikely unless the Shaikh of Dubai (in whose territory most of the journey is performed) has lost all control in his State; and in that evsnt we should expect to have sufficient notice to enable us to arrange for the halt on the Trucial Coast to be diverted temporarily elsewhere* 6. It would be a great advantage If approval to the Agree- ment could be communicated to me by telegram*'T-yi JJHAFT. DUBAI C AGREEMENT.

With regard to the proposed move from Gwadur, every effort is being made to have Jiunri available for use before the expiry of the agreement with the Sultan of iviuscat but various technical difficulties have to be overcome. As a result of your telephone conversation with Galpin shortly after the meeting, Tymms was asked by tele gram to negotiate with the Khan of Kalat and to obtain the best terms possible. a signal from Tymms to Galpin dated 28th April concluded with the following words 'Transfer of operations from Muscat to Indian territory involves certain political and administrative questions which are being examined.' We shall keep you informed of further proceedings. Before sending you a formal request to negotiate a renewal of the agreement with the Sheikh of Debai we are awaiting from Imperial Airways a schedule of their require ments. as soon as these have been obtained we shall let you have particulars of the facilities which it is necessary to obtain from the Sheikh.

SIR TRENCHARD FOWLE explained that there were serious objections to the continued use of Dubai by Imperial Airways. These were (si) the exorbitant terms which were being demanded by the Sheikli, and (b) defence considerations. In this latter connection a recent agitation had arisen against the deportation of two gun runners. If drastic action had been necessary there was the question to be considered of native reprisals against the flying boats, the alighting area was situated behind the town, it was out of sight of the sea and there would be no means of any effective aid being rendered by a sloop in the event of the natives shooting at the flying boats, or rendering a landing impossible by anchoring dhows or other craft in the fairway. At Ras-el-Khaimah and Umm-al-Qawain, however, the lagoons could be orotected by the guns of a sloop. In the circum stances SIR TRENCHARD FOWLE considered that it would be preferable if Imperial Airways could vacate Dubai for one of the other two places. (a) Umm-al-^awain . MR. CROSS remarked that he had personally surveyed the three sites, both from the air and on the ground. With regard to Umm-al—Qawain he was of the opinion that the site was not suitable for operation all the year round. At high tide the banks were covered and a flying boat coming Into land would have great difficulty in selecting a suitabxe stretch of water. He had examined the R.A.F. archives ai, Baghdad and had ascertained that the R.A.F. were noi* in favour of this alighting area. He agreed with the suggestion by THE CHAIR'AAN that it might be possible to employ marker buoys.(m? ! - 2 - in order to define the area, hut he thought that a great deal of buoying would be required before such a method would be ^ practicable. He pointed out that dredging would assist, but explained that in that part of the world, costs were definitely prohibitive, and, in addition, once dredging operations were started it v/ould probably be necessary to keep on with them. THK CHAIRMAN observed that if Imperial Airways felt that it would be dangerous for their flying boats to operate at Umm-al-Qawain he did not feel it was practicable to consider that site any further. MR. BANKH stated that he was unable to comment on the Company s contention regarding Umm-al-Qawain as he had not had any personal experience of the alighting areas on the Persian Gulf. (b) Ras-el-Khaimah . In connection with Ras-el- T Chaimah f MR. CROSS observed that the strong prevailing winds were at right angles to the stretch of water. During his investigation of the R.A.F. records at Baghdad he had discovered a recommendation by W/Cdr. Welch (as he then was) to abandon Ras-el-Khaimah and concentrate on Dubai. MR. CROSS stated that in his view it would be Inadvisable to use Ras-el-Xhaimah in preference to Dubai. CDR. GALPIN supported this contention. G/CAPT. CORYTON remarked that it was the considered opinion of the Air Staff that Ras-el-Khaimah was preferable from a technical and operational point of view. He explained that when Dubai had been used by a R.A.P. Squadron during a flight to Singapore, it had been because the wrong type of fuel had been stored at Ras-el-Khaimah. MR. CROSS pointed out that a very strong factor which made Dubai desirable was its proximity to Sharjah, where there existed building accommodation for staff and passengers, and also full wireless facilities. Any further capital expenditure was therefore not necessary; but if it were decided to use Ras-el-Khaimah it would be necessarjr to incur very considerable expenditure on the provision of suitable accommodation and adequate wireless equipment. In reply to the CHAIRMAN, MR. CROSS admitted that it might not be necessary to provide full wireless facilities and that wireless in the launch and the establishment of telegraphic communication with the station at Sharjah might prove sufficient. He pointed out, however, that landline communication could not be regarded as satisfactory in this region. MR. BANKS considered that these arrangements would provide adequate facilities for communications. He suggested the erection of a small building on the shore to house the operator. SIR TRKNCHAJRD P0.7LK stated that it would be necessary to erect a fortified building for passengers in the same way as at Sharjah.&gt; I (c) Dixbai. THIS CHAIRMAN referred to the possibility of dhows being anchored in the fairway at Dubai, and inquired whether this could be avoided if a native policeman accompanied the launch. SIR TRKNCHARD FOWLE explained that this depended upon the power of the Sheikh. There was always an opposition part and it was they who generally were the cause of the trouble. S/LDR. ELY suggested that if on any occasion trouble arose at Dubai, it would be a simple matter for the Company's ground staff to notify the aircraft in advance, and an emergency landing could then be effected at Ras-el-Khaimah. Imperial Airways' representatives agreed that this was a practicable solution. SIR TRENCHARD FOWLE stated that he had no objection to this arrangement if it were considered that in the event oi\ any disturbances arising at Dubai, the Company would be able to use Ras-el-Khaimah in emergency during the period of the trouble. S/LDR. ELY pointed out that in the case of a continued emergency, the Company could slow down their services in order to avoid a night stop at Ras-el-Khaimah. MR. CROSS agreed that this would be oossible but observed that the time tables would have to be completely revolutionised to provide for such a change. CDR. GALPIN stated that at some future time it might be possible to omit the Trucial Coast section from the Company’s itinerary. Ras-el-Khaimah could then be used as an emergency stop. In this connection MR. CROSS observed that all stations should be potential night stops to ensure continued elasticity of the services in the event of any unforeseen delays. G/CAPT. CORYTON informed UR. CROSS that the R.A.F.* would probably be prepared to permit Imperial Airways to store a supply of fuel at Ras-el-Khaimah. He would, however, communicate with MR. CROSS on this point when he had ascertained the position. The Meeting agr eed that Imperial Ai r way s shou ld continue at Duba i and that they should be prepared to use Ras-el-Khaimah i n e mergency should the ques tion of the safety of their services a t Dub ai ar i se on any occasion With regard to the agreement with the Sheikh of Dubai, SIR TRENCHARD FOJLE thought that the Sheikh would probably agree to renew If sufficient inducement were offered, In reply to MR. GALPIN he observed that he did not think it practicable to threaten to move to another site unless there was in fact some definite alternative alighting area which the Company were prepared to use. MR. CROSS pointed out that the payment of £1,000 per annum which the Sheikh was demanding, in addition to approximately £000^ per annum paid at present for services would bring the landing fee to about £3 plus the Rs.5 for each landing as already required under the present Agreement. i' &gt; ; &lt;bf This would in fact not amount to much more than was paid to certain other countries on the route&lt;&gt; MR. HOW stated that from a financial point of view the advantage of Dubai was the common user of the existing facilities at Sharjah, and it was, in his opinion, important to maintain this arrangements If Ras-el'-Khairaah were to be used, it would be necessary practically to duplicate the Sharjah facilities, which would be very costly to the Air Ministry, or the Company, or both; In addition, there was the question of the terms whicn could be obtained from the Sheikh of Ras-el-hhaimaho He thought that it would be preferable from a financial point of view to make the best possible bargain for the use of Dubaio THE CHAIRMAN suggested that in the initial stages of negotiation the £400 should be assumed to be included in the £1,000 now demanded* It was agreed that tne negotiation of a new agreement should be left to the Political Resident, on the best terms obtainable a MR. SYMON inquired as to a suitable term for the Agreement* CDR. GALPIN indicated that the Company would prefer a long term agreement, and suggested a period of about 10 to 15 years* Mr* How thought that if a long tern agreement would result in a reduction of Uie costs it might be advisable; but it seemed that the matter depended primarily on Imperial .airways* view of the probable development of the services* MR. BANKS pointed out that the probability of landplanes replacing flying boats in about five years time should be considered, and ne suggested that five years should be tne maximum period of the Agreement* The meeting agreed that tne negotiations in respect of the Agreement snould be based on a term of five years* MR. RIDDOCH suggested that provision should be made for the Agreement to bind the heirs and successors of the present Sheikh* MR. SYMON stated that this would be borne in mind in drawing up the agreement* CDR. GALPIN inquired whether it would be possible for the question of safeguarding passengers between Dubai and Sharjah to be incorporated in the Agreement o At present there was a written agreement on tiie /natter, signed only by the Sheikh of Dubai, and the Company felt taut the position snould be made more secure* MR. SYMON pointed out that it would not be possible to refer to tne question in the Dubai Agreement, as it was a matter also concerning the Sheikh of Sharjah* SIR TRENCHARD POVVLE stated that the question would be safeguarded in the negotiations with tne Sheikh* 3^ MR. SYMON stated that the Sultan of Muscat, who was at present in England, nad expressed a desire to settle the arrangements regarding the renewal of the present Agreement for the use of Gvvadar, which was due to expire in October next* The Sultan had pointed out that if he continued to give exemption from duties on petrol he would require an increased rental* MR. SYMON remarked that he understood that the Air ministry were contemplating a move from Gwadar to Jiunri* If / this* &lt; - 6 - tills would not take place until after October it would be necessary to make immediate arrangements witn tne Sultan for an extension of tiie Agreemento THE CHAIRMAN stated that operational difficulties made it necessary to leave Gwadar. A ground and air survey of Jiunri had been carried out and a detailed report was expected shortly© Mr© Ranks remarked that if Imperial Airways werejrepared to live under canvas, it would be possible to move to Jiunri before October© THE CHAIRMAN suggested that the Agreement snould be extended for a period of one year© MR. SYMON pointed out that if this were decided, special terms would have to be proposed© He explained tnai. it would be of no use to quote to the Sultan examples of the arrangements existing in British territories, eog« Sudan or Palestine, as the Sultan had pointed out tout he was ruler of an independent and foreign State and was only interested in the arrangements with other foreign countries© MR. SYMON agreed with MR. BANKS that in the event of a move to Jiunri it would be necessary to come to an arrangement with the Khan of Khalat in whose State Jiunri was situated© THE CHAIRMAN undertook to examine the question of the Gwadar Agreement and to brief the India Office as soon as possible©/ T3 -U ✓ J.H fW l:'- , 5 li-DIA OI-'JICE, (gp A Z.2910/38. v.flilTEHALL, S.7.1.

MR. BAflKl considered that these arrange ients would provide udu-iaate facilities tor communications, ho suggestod the erection of a small building on the shore to houoe the operator. ' IK TREHCHARD FOWLS stated that it uouid be neccaa^ry to er*ect a fortified building for pasaangars in the same wsy as at Gharjah* c ) -Atbal . TriK CHAIRMAK referred to the po^ sibixity of-4 i5^&gt; dhowe being anchored in the fairway at Dubai, and inquired whether this could be avoided if a native policeman accompanied the launch. IE TRENCHARD &gt;X&gt;’’LK explained that this depended upon the po^er of the fkeikn. There was alwaya an opposition party and it was they who generally were the cause of the trouble. S/LDR. ELY suggested that if on any occasion trouble arose at ubai, it would be a Bimpxe Tetter for the &lt; ompany’s ground staff to notify the aircraft in advance, and an emergency landing could then be effected at RR 8 -&gt;el*Khaimah. Imperial airways * representatives agreed that this waa a practicable solution. SIR TkENCHA-D FCTLS stated that he had no objection to this arrangement if it were considered thPt in the event of any disturbances arising at Dubai, the Company would be able to use Uae-ei-Khairaah in emergency curing the period of the trouble. Ta/LDR. SLY pointed out that in the case of a continued emergency, the ompany could slow down their services in order to avoid a night stop at as-el-^hainah. MR. ORG r f agreed that this would be possible but observed that the time-tables would have to be completely revolutionised to provide for such a change. CLR. GALPIN stated that at some future time it might be possible to omit the Truciai roast section from the Company’s itinerary. Pas-el-}haimah could then be used as an emergency ctop. In this connection MR. CRCRO observed tha^ ail btatioiie should be potential night stops to ensure continued elasticity of the services in the event of any unfort ©oen delays. G/CAPT. OCHYTCN Informed PR. CROSS that the R.A.F. would probably be prepared to permit Imperial Airways to store a tupply of fuel at Has-ei- haimah.He would, however, conirmnicate with MR.

Pr. how thought that if a long tero atree ent «ould result in a reduction of the costs it might be auvisable; but it seemed that the matter depended primarily on Imperial Airwaya* view of the probable development of the services. UR. 3AMKL pointed out that the probability of landplanaa replacing flying boats in about five years time should be considered, and he suggested that five y arr should be the maximum period of the Agreement. b e vr:' ctln;- eu reed thot tl;e negot iations respect of the preorient rhould be vm -q jn a of five years .

At present there was a written agreement on the matter, el&lt; ned only by the Cheikh of bubal* end tht Company felt that the position should be made more secureKR. CYMOW pointed out that it ould not be poselble to refer to the question in the Dubai greament, as it was a matter aieo concerning the fheikh of .harjah. IH TKKNCHAkD :0 LE stated that the question would be safeguarded in the negotiations with the heikh. MH.

The fultan had pointed out that if he continued to give exemption from a .ties on petrol he would require an increased rental. CYDON remarked that he unuerstood that the Air iniatry were contetnplating a r ove from Gwadar to Jiunri. If this would not take place until after October it wou.d be necessary to rake irm. diate arrange rente with the Cultan for an extension of the Agreement.

In company with Sir Trenchard Powle I was present at a meeting held at Ariel House on the 13th April to discuss this question. The meeting-had before it the memorandum of 9th April prepared by the Air Ministry (P.Z.2SC1). The meeting was unanimous in thinking; that Hmm-al-Q,aiwain could not be regarded as an adequate substitute for Debai for Imperial Airways purposes. As between Debai and Ras-al-Khaimah, the representatives of Imperial Airways were strongly in favour of the former. They pointed out, moreover, that if Ras-al-Khaimah was used as a night stop in place of Debai it would be necessary to incur heavy capital cost on the provision of a resthouse, wireless station and other necessary buildings. There was general agreement that Debai had certain obvious drawbacks from the defence point of view, but after some discussion it was agreed that since Ras-al-Khaimah could be used as an emergency landing ground it would be preferable to continue to retain Debai as a permanent night stop. It/It was accepted that it would he necessary substantially to improve the present terms in order to persuade the Sheikh of Debai to renew the temporary agreement, and it was thought that the new agreement should be for a period of not less than five years. These aspects will be considered further by the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways, who will then let us have a further letter indicating the lines on which the new agreement should be negotiated with the Sheikh.1. Pending the result of en Admiralty survey at Urnm«a!-Qaiwain p Imperial Airways Limited decided in May 1937 to use Dahai as a night stop, since advantage could be taken of the existing accommodation at Sharjah, 7 miles distant. The political agent at Bahrein negotiated with the Sheikh of Labai and on 22nd July, 1957, an agreement was executed by which the Sheikh undertook to provide guards and either to construct the necessary buildings himself, or alternatively, to grant sites for their erection by the Company, the rent to be agreed later in each case. The final clause of the agreement read as follows:- 'This agreement will be for a temporary period of one year in the first instance and nay be extended for any further period to be agreed upon later on condition that these terms remain unaltered .' 1 2. On 17th September the Sheikhs of Sharjah and D&amp;bai accepted responsibility for the safe conduct of passengers between Dabai and Sharjah, either by providing escorts for motor cars or by erecting watch towers. 3. In February 1938 Imperial Airways Limited wrote:*» “Up to date the Sheikh has indicated to the political Resident that he would not be prepared to er-ct the buildings but that we can do eo provided that labour and materials were obtained from him and that v/o paid a monthly rental for the sites required of Rs. 1 C 00 . The political agent has, however, confidentially indicated that the Sheikh might be persuaded to reduce this exorbitant figure, provided that the agreement wav extended to a reasonable term. Our opinion o f the future use of Dabai is that we can find no bettei* place in the neighbourhood and that it seems that it will be Aa good many yeara before we shall be able to omit a refuelling call between Bahrein and Gwadur 11 » of two west-botmd flights in the new summer time table. deportation of two gun runners and the manumission of slaves, and on 27th March the Political Kesident (Buehire), stated that the Sheikh refused to renew the agreement. Ras-el'-Khaimah, and opinions on the comparative merits of the three places are summarised as follovzs:- Dabai. The depth of water is sufficient for aircraft now in operation but leav es little margin i n the case of exceptionally low tides. In day light little difficulty should be experienced unless in the exceptional case of strong south west or north east winds. If the small area of shallows to the north east of the buoy is to experienced commanders. Early morning fogs were frequent during the period of the survey and blind take-offs are impossible (imperial Airways' report dated 29/10/37 on survey by echo sounder). On 17th June, 1937, Squadron Leader Darvall reported that during his Irak tour in 1934 and 1935 he always foun d Dabai unsatisfactory and on two occasions touched bottom in a l ightly loaded service Rangoon aircraft. Ree-al~Khoiraah was preferred as a refuelling place. The Political Resident in the Persinn Gulf 4. Dabai has been scheduled as a night stop in the case 5. On 22nd March, 1938£ the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that ^trouble had arisen over the 6 . The alternatives to Debai are Umm-al-Qaiwain and dredged, Dabai should present little difficulty referred in his letter of 22nd March, 1936, to /thethe danger of local malcontents shooting at flying boats and obstructing them by anchoring dhows in the fairway. In the event of war, D&amp;bai is particularly vulnerable. The alighting area is in a lagoon out of sight of the sea and therefore cannot be defended by a sloop. U mm-al-Qaiwain. The lagoon is a series of tortuous channels north of the survey, over which there is a high water depth of 9 ft. The deep water channel southward of the town is always full of dhows. The eastern end of the spit on which the tom stands is used as a dump for decaying oyster shells (HoM.S. Bideford survey). Permission to carry out the survey was given grudginglyc The lagoon is a mass of tortuous sandbanks and the launch was continually running aground during the soundings. ' Umm-al~Qaiwain could in emergency be used but only boats are available. Transport by the *ea route is not very comfortable and entry to Dabai harbour by night is out of the question. Power among sandy flats and the banks are steep. The entrance to the lagoon is a deep water channel, shoaling gradually to a bar about half a mile if une channels were marked out with buoy 8 ; and night operations are out of the question. There is communication with Dabai either by road or sea. The road is difficult and for transferring loads from aircraft to the shore only two local boats rapidly become encrusted with barnacles (imperial Airways 7 report of survey by echo sounder). /Has-el~KheimahRaa~e1~KhaImah .

Air Facilities at Debai. • For the present (and it is understood for some years to come) it will be necessary for the flying boats operating on the Empire air mail route to make a night stop in the Persian Gulf. Pending the result of an Admiralty survey at Umm al Q,aiwain, Imperial Airways decided, in May 1937, to use Debai for this purpose, since advantage can be taken of the existing accommodation at Sharjah, 7 miles away. Negotiations were accordingly opened with the Sheikh of Debai, and on 22nd July 1937 an Agreement was executed, by which the Sheikh agreed to provide the required facilities at a rental of Rs.440 a month, excluding the rent for any buildings which might be required. The final clause of the Agreement runs as follows:- ’’This Agreement will be for a temporary period of one year in the first instance and may be extended for any further period to be agreed upon later, on condition that these terms remain unaltered.” In February last information was received to the effect that the Sheikh was not prepared to erect the buildings required himself, but that Imperial Airways could do so themselves, provided that the labour and materials were obtained from the Sheikh, and that he was paid a monthly rental for the sites required of Rs. 1 , 000 . A month later the Political Resident reported that, arising out of the recent disturbances at Debai, the Sheikh had indicated that he was not prepared to renew the Air Agreement. Simultaneously a memorandum was received from the Resident, in which he expressed his personal view that tits wt 8 s&gt;oo/iii 10,000 4.33 there/there were serious objections to the continued use of Debai by Imperial Airways, and suggesting that the question of utilising either Ras-al-Khaimsh or Umm-al- Qaiwain as an alternative site should be considered. Such was the situation when the Resident came home on deputation at the end of March, and at the suggestion of the Air Ministry a meeting was held (on 13th April) to consider the matter. After hearing technical arguments for and against the use of the three possible sites , it was agreed that Imperial Airways should continue at Debai and that Ras-al-Khaimah should be used in emergency should the question of the safety of their service.at Debai arise on any occasion. Sir Trenchard jowle entirely agreed with this decision, and at the request of the Air Ministry he has now been authorised to commence negotiations with the Sheikh of Debai for a new Agreement extending over a period of 5 years on the best terms available. The Air Ministry (and Imperial Airways) recognise that in order to obtain a new Agreement it may be necessary to considerably increase the existing terms, and the Resident has been given a free hand (up to a maximum of Rs.1,000 a month,including the present payment of Rs.440 a month.)

Late yesterday evening a message was received that the Shaikh of Dubai wished to see me again before I left. I accordingly saw him once more this morning. There were no further requests for pardoning the arms- smugglers and there w'as no mention of slaves, but the Shaikh of Dubai informed me that the Majlis had stated at a meeting last night that they did not wish him to renew the Dubai Civil Air Agreement. I am not yet sure how seriously this should be taken, but I am inclined to believe from the Shaikh’s manner that there is a certain amount of 'face-saving' about it and that after a couple of months or so negotiations for the renewal of the Agreement may well be successful. There can however be little doubt that better financial terms will be required. At the same time this gives point to the remarks in Sir Trenchard Fowle’s letter No.C/150 dated the 22 nd March 1938 in regard to the Imperial Airways’ halt on the Trucial Coast. It is urgently necessary to come to a decision whether it is desired to carry on with the (unsatisfactory) base at Dubai, or whether an attempt should be made to negotiate a Civil Air Agreement at Ras al Khaimah or even Drnm al Qaiwain. One may anticipate considerable difficulties in conducting such negotiations and the longer time there is for them the better. This question was recently discussed at a meeting at the Air Ministry. The decision reached was that Debai should be continued as a night stopping place and the Resident is being instructed to commence negotiations for a new 5 years Agreement on the best terms obtainable.

March, 1938. fi-cfb vvx fay KjiSi Ifa' ysx. . / Ur 'b I am directed hy the Secretary of State for Air to refer to correspondence terminating with India Office semi-official letter, P.Z.7143/37, of the 4th November, 1937, concerning the provision of facilities for Imperial Airways Ltd., at Dubai. 2. I am to inform you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that representations have been made recently by the Company emphasising the necessity for making arrangements as soon as possible for the provision of permanent safety precautions, by means of watch towers or some other device, for passengers and personnel travelling between Dubai and Sharjah, owing to the unsatisfactory nature of the existing temporary measure, by which a guard is carried in each vehicle crossing the boundary between Sharjah and Dubai. 3. The view expressed by the Political Agent, Bahrain, in October last, that it would be inadvisable to bring pressure to bear on the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai to come to an agreement in connection with the provision of permanent safety precautions between their two States, appears to have been primarily conditioned by the impression that Dubai was to be used only temporarily as a night stop. In this connection it is relevant to quote the following extract from a letter received from Imperial Airways on the Ibth February last:- 'Our opinion of the future use of Dubai is that we can find no better place in the neighbourhood and that it seems that it will be~a good many years before we shall be able to omit a refuelling call between Bahrain and Gwadur’*. Dubai has been scheduled as a night stop in the case of two west bound flights in the new summer timetable of the Einpire Air Mail Services. 4 . A further difficulty at Dubai has been reported by Imperial Airways. The Company are desirous of erecting certain /facilities -consisting ofsmall store, a shelter for passengers ! and a suitable jetty alongside which the motor launches could be moored. It is understood that the Shailch has indicated to the Political Agent that he would not be prepared to erect the buildings but that the Company could do so, provided that the necessary labour and materials were obtained from him, and that The Under Secretary of State, India Office, S. W. 1* I j I 23 MAR 1938 | ^ I INDIA OFF!he received a monthly rental of* Rs* 1000 f‘ur the sites required. Imperial Airways consider that this proposed charge is exoroitant and Lord Swinton shares this view. He understands, hov/ever, that the Political Agent has indicated confidentially to the Company’s local representative, that the Shaikh might he' persuaded to reduce the figure of Rs.1000, if the latter were given an assurance that the agreement would be extended for a reasonable term. 6 . In these circumstances, Lord Swinton agrees that it would be advisable to consider the extension of the existing Agreement for, say, a term of three years, when it becomes due for renewal in July next. 7. . Lord Swinton would suggest, therefore, if the Marquis of Zetiand sees no objection, that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be instructed to commence early negotiations for (a) the provision of permanent safety precautions, (b) the provision of sites for Imperial Airways’ buildings at an economic rental, (c) the renewal of the existing agreement (due on 22nd July next) for a term of three years. 6 . Lord Swinton wmild invite attention to clause 2(d) of the Agreement which provides that all buildings and constructions of an immovable nature would revert to the Shaikh in the event of the termination of the lease, and would point out that the Company have expressed their intention of providing buildings of a semi permanent nature which could be moved should the necessity arise.

Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Gamp Bahrein, 22nd March, 1938 Subject Defence of the Persian Gulf in times of war. My dear Metcalfe, Could you please refer to my Express letter No. C/145 of the 21st March 1938 in which I gave the details of a rather serious agitation at Debai which had arisen recently against the deportation of two gun-runners, and against our policy of manumitting slaves who apply to us for manumission. The agitation against the latter procedure, which has been in force for many years, came about owing to the large increase of such applications which have been made to us in the last few months. There is of course no question of our giving up our policy of manumission, but the last reports from Debai indicated that the situation was quieter. 2. This agitation, however, raises in a somewhat acute form the defence of the Trucial Coast section of the Air Route to India. (See paragraphs 23-24 of Note enclosed with my letter No. C/14 of 18th January). If in the present instance drastic action to quell the agitation had been necessary, or may still be necessary, such as preventing by a sloop the Debai pearling fleet going to sea, before we put such action into force we would have to consider the safety of the Imperial Airways flying boats, which, as you are aware, land some eight times or so a week at Debai for refuelling. As a reply to such action on our part the local malcontents might retaliate by shooting up a flying boat or two, (nothing is more helpless than a civil flying boat on the water), or render their landing difficult or impossible by anchoring dhows or small boats in the ‘fairway*.

'#hat applies to an agitation in time of peace applies still more to a situation which might rise in time of war. I have already referred (see paragraphs 8 ( 2 ) and 26 (l) of my Note quoted above) to the very effective use made by our enemies in the last 'tfar of capable agents at Bushire and Muscat. I see no reason to suppose that in the next war, (if it comes), our enemies will not try and employ the same means, only at Debai and Sharjah, say, instead of at Bushire. There is always an opposition party to every Shaikh on the Trucial Coast, and generally an opposition party in every Shaikhdom which is more or less hostile to ns, and it would not be difficult for agents well supplied with funds, and operating from the Trucial Coast hinterland, to stir up the local malcontents to interfere with the Air Route. U. In so far as Debai is concerned, it seems to me per sonally that from the defence point of view this Airways* station is particularly vulnerable. The alighting area is in a lagoon between which and the sea lies the town. The area is out of sight of the sea, and therefore even if a sloop were available for defence purposes, which apparently is not the case (see paragraph 2(2) of my Note), any effect ive action could be extremely difficult. The creeks at ei ther Umm al Qaiwain or Ras al Khaimah would seem to be pre ferable from the defence aspect, and if these have not been definitely ruled out for Imperial Airways* Plying Boats I suggest that they be reconsidered. Imperial Airways have not yet committed themselves to Debai, and the present temporary agreement with -the Shaikh expires in July. 5* I have discussed the above with Weightman who has visited Debai and who entirely concurs with ray views.-v rtf 3.

We see no general administrative objection to the permission which has been given, but our technical officers consider it oxt^emely doubtful — if the apparatus is of the type already examined by them — whether the Transreceivers operating on 4g- to 5 metres wavelength v/ould be found suitable for communication over the distance between Sharjah and Debai (which is understood to be about 20 kilometres ( 122 ' lailea)), particularly as the route appears to be overland or along the coast and interference from the motor engines on the launch may be experienced.

'reports of damage which has 'been caused on various occasions to the rubber mooring buoys which are used on the Empire air routes. In some cases the damage seems to have been wilfully caused by natives or water fauna such as crocodiles, but in several instances it appears to have been the result of contact with the propellers of launches and steamers. Local Authorities should be asked to issue a warning to shipping with a view to precautionary measures being taken during the navigation of areas used by Imperial Airways 1 flying boats, in order to avoid collision with the mooring buoys.

The Shaikh said that there was no danger to be apprehended during the day time. I entirely agreed with this statement. The dhaikh further stated that at night there would probably be no danger in aoraal times, but that he suggested that guards should be carried fro® Dubai in the cars that were taking the passengers. I pointed out to him that this would be practicable as a temporary arrangement but that guards naturally took up space required for the carriage of passengers and esked him if he could thinlp of no sore satisfactory arrangement as a permanent measure. He said that the best way to safeguard the passengers would be the erection of guerd towers. He suggested one or two and asked if I had consulted the Shaikh of Sharjah. 1 stated that I had not consulted the Shaikh of Sharjah but proposed to do so the following day and it was then deci ded that the matter should be allowed to remain over until I had seen the Shaikh of Sharjah. i/ s/c.S. On the aomlng of the 10th September I interviewed the Sheiich of Sherj&amp;h and found that he was averse to the towers because he was not sure where the Sheikh of Dubei proposed to build the towers and was afraid that the Buler of Dubai would encroach on what he claimed to be his terri tory. He himself suggested the use of guards travailing in the motor cars. He completely accepted his responsibi lity as far as his frontiers were concerned for the safety of the personnel and p&amp;siengers of the imperial Airways. He suggested that ills guards should travel from Sharjah to Dubai and that Dubai guards should return to Sharjah when passengers were travelling at night time. I arranged that the two Shaikhs should meet half way between Sharjah and Dubai on the morning of the lltb and talk matters over. 8. On the morning of the 11th she Shaikh of Sharjah and the Shaikh of Dubai mot in ay presence half way between their respective towns and discussed the situation. After a privet# discussion they stated that they had come to the conclusion that the best solution would be the building of towers but that they thought that the erection of towers was £ natter for consideration and that until such time as they have been able to consider the question, they were prepared to provide guards to travel backwards and forwards betwesn Saarjah and Dubai. I impressed on them the neces sity for a rapid decision on this matter as the guards would naturally be an inconvenience to Imperial Airways. They said that they quite realised the necessity for speed and that they would talk the matter over and let me know their decision as soon as possible. I told them that I * 012 x 1 require to know their decision before they took any steps towards putting their proposals into practice as naturally anything that was arranged would require the approval/-*pprav«ii of the Honourable the Resident in the Persian Guift 4, I have acquainted the Station Superintendent, Imperial Airways, Sharjah, of the present situation and told hia that until further notice when proceeding to Dubai at night end returning from Dubai he should carry Sharjah guards from Sharjah to Dub&amp;i and Dubai guards fro« Dubai to Sharjah* I further pointed out to hin that this would be a teapor&amp;ry arrangement and that I trusted that something more permanent and more practicable would be devised in the near future* 5* So far there had been no question of additional rent for guards etcetera, but I expect that the two Shaikhs after talking the matter over will make a demand for guards on their own* X do not anticipate that this will amount to very much as we can always point out to them that any permanent arrangement that we may come to ©guards their own Interests as well as ours* X have the honour to be.

To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.T/188 dated the 15th September 1937 and to encloee a document setting forth shortly the arrangements that have been come to in my presence between the Shaikh of Dubai and the Shaikh of Sharjah on Saturday the 11th of September. You will note that the statement has been signed by the Shaikh of Dubai as being correct. I endeavoured to get Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar, the Huler of Sharjah, to sign the document as well, but was unsuccessful. 2. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar is a very cautious individual who will not sign anything if he can possibly help it. Although he realises that when he has made a verbal statement it is just as binding on him as a signed document, the physical act of signing appears to cause him acute suffering. He refused point blank to accept apy responsibility for the safety of passengers travelling between the aerodrome and the boundaries of Dubai. I pointed out to him that he had already accepted responsibility in the presence of myself, Shaikh Said bin Maktum, and the Residency Agent. /e discussed the question for some time and it became evident that he thought that by signing he might prejudice a future claim for payment of guards. Eventually I -/ wentwent through the statement with him and he agreed that it was in the form that was agreed between him and the Ruler of Dubai* He further agreed to abide by the present arrangement for guards until such time as he and the Shaikh of .Dubai came to a more permanent agreement* He stated that he would endeavour to meet the Shaikh of Dubai on the 19th of September and I told him that I would be glad to hear as soon as they have come to an arrange- ment and if he contemplated employing ejctra men as guards he should state the number required and that we would give the matter our consideration* The Shaikh of Sharjah quite realises his responsibility. ^ discuused this question with the Residency Agent, Sharjah, on his return from Kalba this morning and he agreed with me that there was not the slightest doubt that the Shaikh of Shnrjah had given his undertaking and futther we both agreed that there was no reason to think that the Shaikh would not carry out his responsibility. The Residency Agent is again approaching the Shaikh with a view to clearing up this difficulty as soon as possible* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd* T.

V ss4 Translation of Agreement between the Shaikh of Dubai and the Political Agent, Bahrain regarding the safety of passengers and personnel passing between Dubai and Sharjah Rest House, At the meeting which took place between us and the Political .Agent, Bahrain, on the llth of September 1937, we decided that, in view of our responsibility for the safety of passengers and personnel passing between Dubai and Sharjah Rest House we would consider without loss of time the question of arranging permanent safety precaution for passengers between our towns by means of watch towers or some other device. In the meantime we consider it sufficient for motor cars to carry guards from either Bharjah or Dubai when travelling backwards and forwards by night. Sd. Said bin Maktum. The above is correct. Sd.

Dear Bertram, With reference to our telephone conversation of this afternoon, this is to confirm that we expect to use Dibai as a nightstop for a period of approximately two months from the beginning of October, 1937. During that period we are planning to use Dibai once weekly in each direction. There will, therefore, be four journeys for passengers between Dibai and Sharjah per week during that period. After that period we expect to replace altogether the Hannibal services by flying boat services, and at the same time to introduce a faster schedule, which will include flying bet ween Basra and Karachi in one day. Under these conditions Dibai will no longer be a nightstop but will be a refuelling stop only. Passengers will not need to go to Sharjah, but it will, of course, be necessary for our staff to travel from Sharjah to Dibai and return each time a flying boat passes through Dibai. I feel sure that you will understand that we cannot conanit ourselves definitely to this period of two months, as there are many circumstances which may make it necessary for us to alter our plans. We see no reason, however, at the present time why they should not be brought into effect. Yours sincerely, (sgd.) B. W. Galpin. G.L.

Please refer to Air Ministry letter of the 14th May (reference S.36004) with regard to the provision of facilities for Imperial Airways in the Persian Gulf. Your reference is, I think, P.Z.5239/1935. In that letter we state that Imperial Airways were considering the use of Bahai at the out-set until the result of the survey at Umm al Qaiwain was known. It will he necessary to lay moorings at Dahai and to mark out the alighting area with suitable marker huoys and to provide accommodation at Dahai for the staff in charge of the marine equipment. Passengers would he transported hy road to the rest-house at Sharjah, where they would stay the night. I have now heard from Imperial Airways that they have received a telegram from their Manager Iraq and Persian Gulf Area asking that the Political Resident at Bahrein may he requested to negotiate immediate concessions with the Sheik of Dahai for the use of the Creek and for permission to lay moorings which have heen shipped to Sharjah, so that a survey flight with a new Empire flying hoat can he carried out in July. Until permission has heen given hy the Sheik of Dahai Imperial Airways’ prepara tions there cannot proceed. The telegram to Imperial Airways was despatched from Sharjah yesterday and it is understood from it that V/. Johnston, Esq., M.C., India Office, S.W.l. /the\ the British Political Agent at Bahrein was also at Sharjah, will you please, therefore, send a telegram at once so that advantage can he taken of his presence in the neighbourhood.

The letter is self-explanatory and in the circumstances explained therein the Resident proposes, if necessary, to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh by threatening to prevent his pearling fleet from proceeding to the banks, or, if they have already proceeded there, to have them brought back to Umm al Qawain where they will be detained until obstruction ceases. This action, which is similar to that approved in connection with the obtaining of air facilities at Abu Dhabi in 1935 (see papers flagged , B* in Collection 5/36) requires the sanction of His Majesty’s Government. ^ ^aJ ^ ^ * In the circumstances explained the Government of India agree with the suggested action, and it is therefore proposed, if the Foreign Office and Admiralty , to accord sanction.

Sir, 3218 I 17 AIR ministry, LONDON, W.G. 2. \fi, I May, 1937. I am directed by the Secretary of State for Air to refer to correspondence under India Office reference of the 1st August, 1935, number PZ5239/1935, concerning the provision of facilities for Imperial Airways in the Persian Gulf. 2. I am to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that, in connection with the contemplated inauguration of air services with flying boats under the Empire Air Mail Scheme, arrangements have now been made with the Admiralty for a survey of a water area at Umm al Qaiv/ain to be carried out by H.M. S. Bideford. 3. Until the company can schedule night landings at Karachi on the flying boat services, it will be necessary to make a night stop in the Persian Gulf. 4. In the event of the result of the survey at Umm al Qaiv/ain being satisfactory, it is extremely doubtful v/hether time will admit of the conclusion of the necessary negotiations with the local Sheikh, and the provision of the accommodation required by the date of the commencement of the flying boat service. 5. The company are, therefore, now considering the use of Dabai at the outset, since by such an arrangement, they will be able to utilise the existing accommodation at Shargah. It will only be necessary to lay moorings, which have already been shipped to Shargah, and mark out the alighting area v/ith suitable marker buoys, and to provide a &gt; accommodation at Dabai for the staff in charge of the marine equipment. Passengers would be transported by road to the rest house at Shargah, where they would stay the night. 6. If, subsequently, operational experience proves that Dabai is not suited for all-weather operations, and The Under-Secretary of State, India Office, London, S.W. 1, /Umm al Qaiwain .... ^Unun al Qaiwain, as a result of* the Admiralty survey, is found to he superior, consideration would he given hy the Company to transferring from Dahai to Umm al Qaiwain as a re-fuelling stop. 7. As the Marquis of Zetland will he aware, difficulties have heen experienced in the past with the Sheikh of Dahai (see correspondence accompanying semi official letter of 16th March, 1933, number PZ1456/33, addressed to Captain S. S. C. Peirce, D. S. 0. , A. F. C., hy Mr. Laithwaite); hut so far as is known, these local diffi culties, with the lapse of time, have now heen overcome. 8. Lord Swinton will, therefore, he glad if, provided the Marquis of Zetland sees no objection, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may be-informed of the foregoing proposals, and instructed to make a suitable application to the local Sheikh with a view to securing his formal assent. Imperial Airways have already informed their local representative of their proposals, in order that there may he no avoidable delay in their preparations.

Lord Swinton, in conveying the Company^ remarks, desires to associate himself wdth them in thanking their Lordships for causing this assistance to be afforded. 3.

In this connection, Mr. Cross states that a survey vessel will be visiting the Trucial Coast in the near future.

I enclose herewith copy of a letter No«,S. 11041/Air.0. dated the 10th December 1935, from the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in ’Iraq, in reply to a query which I made with regard to the details of the .//T facilities concerned. 3. These facilities come under paragraph 3 (c) of my Express Letter No.914-3, dated the 30th November 1935, and the question now arises as to whether the sites required fall within (c) (l) or (2). In order to dear this point up I suggest that the Royal Air Force should select the sites. At this stage this should be done as unobstrusively as possible in order not to alarm the 10 (Signature) Shaikh / S. 44. (Designation). 'ipif| - \ Shaikh, and the reason for the inspection of the ground should not be divulged. 4 # With reference to paragraph 5 of my Express Letter dated the 30th November quoted above. Since, from paragraph 2 of the Air Officer Commanding's letter enclosed,it will be necessary for personnel to occupy these buildings, which will be situated at about half a mile from the Rest House, I think it would be advisable that they should be guarded. These guards can be provided either (?) by detaching a few guards from those stationed at the Rest House or ( b&gt; by enlisting additional gurrds through the Shaikh. It is for the Royal Air Force, who are the responsible .Defence Authorities, to say which procedure should be adopted. If (b), then the additional guards will have to be paid for, and in return for this it may be possible, as suggested in paragraph 5 of my Express Letter of 30th November to induce the Shaikh to assume responsibility for this new commitment. 5. With regard to paragraph 5 of the Air Officer Commanding's letter, I agree with the proposed amendments. In this connection please see my Printed Letter No.95-3, dated the 16th January 1935. sd.

In order to prevent any misconception arising from the statement in paragraph 5 of my Express Letter No.C-52, dated the 19th March 1935, that I agreed with the Air Ministry that in the territories in A (i.e. Kuwait, Bahrain, Muscat and Sharjah, where we have obtained facilities under respective Civil Air Agreements) the extra facilities required could be installed as a matter of course and without raising the subject with the Shaikhs, I offer the following amplification thereof. (Signature) 3. / (Designation) S. 44. MFP—1013S&amp;P—(M-1323)—30-10-33-—10,000.3 (a) In view of our rights under the respective Agree ments, no question arises of seeking permission from the Ruler for the right to instal the facility. (b) tfhere an additional facility is required to be installed within the limits of the aerodrome in use, again no question of permission arises. (c) Ihe case may arise where additional facilities involve the construction of buildings, W/T masts etc., on land outside the limits of the aerodrome. In this case also there is no question of obtaining permission for the right to instal the facilities. The question of the ownership of the land, however, does arise, as the site required may be (l) waste land, or (2) cultivated or occupied land. In the case of (l), in my opinion, no payment need be made. The Ruler would be informed that the site was required, and the burden of proving that its use would infringe a public right (such as right of way) or a private easement would lie on the Ruler. In the case of (2) a similar procedure would be followed with the addition that compensation would have to be paid for the use of the site. 4. The foregoing, relates to additional facilities to existing aerodromes. In the case of additional civil aero dromes being required a distinction exists between our rights under the Civil Air Agreements with the Rulers of Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat on the one hand, and of Sharjah on the other. In the case of the former we have the right to establish more than /more than one aerodrome and the considerations in paragraph 3 above would apply in the case of any fresh sites required* In the case of the latter the Agreement relates only to the site selected and now in use, and any additional aerodromes will require to be freshly negotiated for* 5* The opinion is expressed in the second paragraph of Air Ministry letter Fo•423224/35/D*0 # 1, dated the 22nd October 1935, that it should suffice for me to inform the Shaikh of Sharjah of the removal of the w/T Station to the new sites proposed and to get his assurance that they will be adequately covered by the Defence Scheme now in force in Sharjah. The guarding of these buildings, however, constitutes a fresh commitment, not covered by the terms of the Shaikh^s agreement with us, and I think it very likely that he will refuse to accept the additional responsibility uhless he is compensated by some payment, say in the form of wages for guards* It may, however, be possible to construct the buildings in such a manner that no normal guarding will be required, or to detach for this duty a few guards from those stationed at the Rest House* I am consult ing the Air Officer Commanding, ’Iraq Command, on this question, and will report separately thereon* I have merely mentioned it here to illustrate the limitations of our Agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah. 6* Finally, in all cases, in order to prevent delay and obstruction, it is essential that adequate notice should be given to the Political Authorities of any work proposed to be carried out in order that the Ruler and other persons concerned /4- 3^ concerned (i.e. possible private owners of land which may be required) may be notified, and any arrangements made that may be called for. sd.

On 3rd November Flight Lieutenant Macdonald with three of 84 Squadron (Vincents) arrived from Muscat, and at lunch time Flight Lieut. Nuttall also arrived from Shaibah with two aircraft and Mr. Cross, who is the Airways Manager of the Near East Area. The object of Mr. Cross' visit was to find a suitable landing place on the Trucial Coast for the 1937 programme Airways flying boats. After lunch Col. Loch, Mr. Cross, my navigator - Lieut. Tod - and myself, were flown over Ras-al-Khaimah, Umm-al-Qawain and Debai to have a look at the lagoons at these places. We then returned to Sharjah and the whole party came off to the 'Lupin' to discuss future plans. UMM-AL-QAWAIN . 5. Next day, at the request of Colonel Loch, I moved up to Umm-al-Qawain and the Shaikh came off to call as soon as we hqd anchored, the call being returned by Col. Loch and Mr. Cross before sunset; the usual salutes were fired. 6. The Shaikh was quite agreeable to a survey of his lagoon being made and this was done by Lieut. Tod, who was accompanied by Mr. Cross, next day. RAS - AL -KHAIMAH. 7. I moved up from Umm-al-Qawain to Res-al-Khaimah early on 6th November and anchored off the entrance to the lagoon. The interpreter was sent in to explain to the Shaikh that we were visiting Ras-al-Khaimah, as we had always anchored before off the town. He brought back the Shaikh's cousin to call, the Shaikh himself being still away at Bahrain. 8. When the Shaikh's cousin was asked about the surveying of the lagoon, he was at first very suspicious and pointed out that the R.A.F. flying boats had used the lagoon for the past ■■ f'■ i! 1 &gt; i. mi,'i ifew years. In time, however, he gained the impression that there was a possibility of money forthcoming in the future and so gave his consent.M A \ ( 3'8, i^_u '_if_^_ ^zl /{ ?^ ~( fit7 rr) W^'i 1 ^ y ‘ i -;,, 165.

Two aeroplanes of the Royal Air Force and Ji.M.S. Lupin were placed at his disposal to assist him in making his investigations. On the 3rd November accompanied by the Political Agent, the Officer Commanding and Navigating Officer of H.M.S. Lupin, Mr.Cross examined from the air the creeks at Dubai, Umm al Quwain and Ras al Khaimah at high tide. On the next day accompanied by the Political Agent he examined the creeks of Dubai and Umm al Quwain at low tide. Mr.Cross visited Umm al Quwain in H.M.S.Lupin and was introduced by the Political Agent to the Shaikh, who gave permission for an examination of the creek by boat. Mr.Cross then proceeded to Ras al Khaimah in H.M.S.Lupin and took soundings in the creek from a motor launch. On his return journey Mr.Cross examined Khor Qunai from the air. At Bahrain he visited Khor Qalaivah.Air Facilities on the Arab Coast of the Persian G-ulf. IW- , Please see the papers at P.Z. 7612/35- Colonel Fowle comments on the revised list of the Air Ministry’s desiderata hastnow 'been received. I think we may agree with Colonel Powle’s conclusions. Permission to instal night beacons at Abu Dhabi and Yas was v obtained in the course of negotiations with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi at the beginning of this year (see P.Z.1471/35 in the file s attached). The facilities required at Qatar may be said to be covered by the undertaking given by the Sheikh to give all facilities for the defence of Qatar. This undertaking was given in connection with the Qatar Oil Concession in the summer. Arrangements have, no doubt, been made locally for the facilities required at Ras al Khaimah. We do not appear to have any papers on the subject, but it is a very small matter. The facilities required at Koweit and Bahrein are covered * * 72 htyis t&gt;y the Civil Air Agreement. There appears therefore to be no objection to the Air Ministry starting \w&gt; rk in these places without further delay. Colonel Powle has promised further comments upon the facilities required at Shargah, and it is to be hoped that these afeo may be brought within the scope of the Shargah Air Agreement. This leaves Sur, Halul and Das, Kalba and Umm al Qaiwain. Colonel Fowle seems to be taking appropriate steps to obtain facilities at these places, but/** ^ Draft Paper. Department.

Reference your U/o D.3413-No.35, and your U/o D.3546.N.35, dated 5th and 15th August 1935, respectively. 1. The sheltered water available for use as seaplane anchorages on the Trucial Coast consists of creeKs which run some distance inland. There are a number of these creeks, most of which contain sufficient depth of water in one part or another to permit of their use by seaplanes. They vary mainly in the amount of safe water available, in the number of directions in which alighting and taking-off is possible, and, most important of all, in the extent to which the safe water is clearly defined. 2. I thoroughly reconnoitred all the creeks along this coast in 1331, and to the best of my recollection full reports with sketches were submitted at the time to the Air Ministry, and in any event should be available in the files at Air Headquarters, Baghdad. However, I think I can remember clearly the three creeks mentioned in these communications. 3. At UMALQUAIWAIN there is plenty of water, permitting alighting into practically all winds at all stages of the tide. The limits of the safe water is, however, very undefined, being bordered by large areas of shallow water and semi-submerged mud banks, very dargerous for flying boats. The alighting areas would, therefore, require to be thoroughly buoyed and lighted before they could be safely used. An equally strong objection to the creek is the lack of firm banks in the vicinity of the alighting areas. The deep water is for the most part separated from the shore by wide stretches of mud only passable at high tide. A site for a civilian air station of this kind should permit of : (a) the location of a Rest House reasonably accessible from the flying boat; (b) the flying boat itself being brought up to a pier or jetty; (c) the prevision of slipways on firm ground. No— No facilities for these requirements exist at UMAI4KJAIWAIN except in the imnediate neighbourhood of the village, where the smells are more intense and more aggressive than at any other village I know on that part of the coast, which is saying a good deal. The natives live on fish which is supposed to be dried in the sun but which to Western noses is in the last stages of putrefaction. As the only obvious sites for a Rest House are in the neighbourhood of the village itself, they are on this account unsuitable. These difficulties could, no doubt, be got over at considerable expense, but I do not recomnend the place. 4. The best of these creeks is that at DIBAI, near SHARJAH. This was the creek which I strongly recommended should be used by Imperial Airways when they first opened the route. There is plenty of water and the bends in the creek give adequate directional facilities. The banks are firm and clearly defined and the deep water extends right up to them. A certain amount of buoying and lighting is recommended. There are good sites for buildings, slipways, jetties, or anything else required. The sites are clean and some distance from the town which is vastly superior in every way to UMALQUAIWAIN. It is the place at which B.I. liners call and is relatively rich and civilised. 5. Next to DIBAI, I would recommend RAS-AL-KHAIMAR which has been largely used by R.A.F. flying boats. RAS-AL-KHAIMAR has an excellent creek, but it is practically one directional only. Fortunately it lies into the prevalent wind but at times aircraft can only use the creek by alighting or getting off across wind, which is not desirable There is plenty of water and the banks are firm and well defined. There are excellent sites for buildings, slipways, jetties, or anything else required. The chief difficulty at RAS-AL-KHAIMAR, which I regarded as suitable from a technical point of view, was the obstinate refusal of the Sneik of RAS-AL-KHAIMAR to allow the establish ment of a civil air station in his creek. 6. I would strongly recommend that Imperial Airv/ays should use the creek at DIBAI, and as I am sure it is suitable from the technical point of view, I do not know what their objections to it are. FailingFailing DIBAI, I recommend RAS-AL-KHAIMAR, and I do not recommend UMALQUAIWAIN for the reasons given above. i 3d/- E. R.

Deer I understand from Laithv/aite that you are now handling aviation matters in the Persian Gulf and am therefore writing to invoke your assistance in the following Difficulty has arisen regarding the most suitable site for a refuelling port for Imperial Airways between Bahrain and Gwadar. Imperial Airways had originally visualized using the creek at Debai, but in view of detailed information received regarding the water available there f the conclusion was arrived at that this place would not be very suitable. It had been previously suggested that Ras al Kaimah might be suitable. The Company, however, are most averse to using the latter, as it would involve waste of time and petrol in climbing in the vicinity of the alighting area in order to gain sufficient height to cross the mountains to the South-East. They there fore are very anxious to find some suitable spot nearer to Sharjah. It has been suggested that a lagoon near Umm al Khaiv/ain might prove suitable, and provided there is no objec tion it is desired to carry out a careful reconnaissance of the place. Ihe Admiralty are being asked to agree that a proper marine survey should be carried out in order to obtain accurate Information regarding the depth of water. For survey purposes the Admiralty require the assistance of suitable air photographs and we would propose asking Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, to arrange for these to be taken. It is appreciated that prior to carrying out either M. J. C^auson Esq., India Office S.W.l. 9 WP19?!} /of1 of these operations the concurrence of the India Office is necessary. Provided there is no objection would you please arrange for this to be given and notify the Resident accordingly. I may mention that the matter has been discussed informally with Colonel Loch, who awaits official instructions.3 / / 7 The question of air facilities on the Arab coast came up in the course of the meeting yesterday at the Air Ministry, attended by Mr. Dibdin and myself, to discuss the Empire Air Mail scheme, night flying on the Imperial Air routes, etc. Wing-Commander Allen said that at their meeting the Resident in Baghdad in May, Colonel Fowle had again pointed out his difficulties in attempting to obtain facilities on the Arab coast piecemeal, and had asked if the Air Ministry could provide a comprehensive list of their probable requirements on the Arab coast during the next two a demi-official letter on the subject, and the Air Ministry had since been in correspondence with Imperial Airways. When they have obtained the views of Imperial Airways, the Air Ministry hope to be able to produce a comprehensive revised list of their requirements, and they will then be in a position to reply to the India Office letter of 10th May, (P.Z. 2164/35). I said that if the Air Ministry could produce / revised list of their requirements in the fairly near future, it might be possible to discuss the matter with the Resident in London since he was coming home on leave at the end of this month, and would be available for discussions during September. A provisional list of facilities required by Imperial Airways, which was circulated at the meeting, is attached. As compared with the list enclosed in the Air Ministry letter of 18th January (P.Z. 395/35) it will be seen that provision is made for certain facilities at Ras-al-Khaimah or at some other point on the Arab coast, ext C&lt;A. h'n&amp;s ^ years. Wing-Commander Allen had then^written the Resident Ras-al-Khaimah. ^Imperial Airways wished to establish a refuelling base at the Resident dent had as yet been unableM z 2 . to obtain facilities at 0(alba, but Wing-Commander Allen -— tJinncbt Colonel Powle seemed more hopeful now about obtaining any additional facilities on the Arab coast, since the Sheikhs were becoming used to aeroplanes, and might be quite eager to profit, as certain of them had already done, by aiioroing facilities. 0 - &lt;/7I V Register No. P.

The rest of the facilities required are in the territories within the sphere of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Some of these are at places where we have already obtained general air facilities and where the beacons now required can be represented to the Sheikhs as part of the normal equipment of the landing grounds for which we have already obtained their permission. No difficulty is therefore anticipated in regard to these. The remainder of the ] new requirements are at places where we have hitherto obtained no air iacilities — namely Halul and Das Islands and at Kalba. we have not yet been successful in obtaining from the Sheikh of Kalba permission for a landing ground and the installation of a beacon at Kalba will clearly have to wait until this permission has been obtained. Das Island seems certainly to be in Abu Dhabi ^**4 Cen^ti'cLt\Aj^ ^ tg- territory and Halul Island mi-ght also be o4aimed -by- Abu Dhabi. Colonel Fowle points out in his express letter of 19th March that, if he had received information in time about the additional facilities required at Halul and Das, it might have been possible to obtain them during therecent negotiations with the Sheikh of* Abu Dhabi in respect of Yas Island and Abu Dhabi itself. He emphasises again the undesirability of a piecemeal method of trying to obtain facilities from the various Sheikhs and asks whether the Air Ministry could give an assurance that the facilities now mentioned represent their final requirements, at all events for a period of, say, two years. We might, I think, support the Resident’s views and ask the Air Ministry whether it would be possible for them to give the assurance indicated by Colonel Fowle. A draft letter to the Air Ministry is submitted accordingly. U-L u rs— T&gt;r . J'rV Draft Paper. P.Z. 2164/35. Department.

A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office.3o Nos. 5 and 7 have been obtained - vide my Express Letter No.C/13 of 22nd February 1935. 4. The facilities required with which I am concerned can be divided into two categories: A. Territories where we have obtained general facilities unaer respective Civil Air Agreements. This comprises Nos*l, 3 } 8 and 12. B. This comprises two areas in Abu Dhabi territory — (Nos.4 and 6) and Kalba (No.9). In the former territory we have merely obtained certain specific * facilities limited to areas Nos.5 ana 7 f ana an Kalba territory we have obtained no facilities at all. 5. I agree, however, witn the Air Ministry (paragraph 3 of their letter of 18th January) that in the territories in A (Nos.1, 3, 8 and 12) the extra facilities now required can be installed as a matter of course and without noising.the subject with the Shaikhs. Should the latter make objections we can quite fairly explain to them tnat the beacons wireless and meteorological stations are part o^ the normal organization connected with landii-g grounds . 6. Category B is however on a different footing• 7. BEfore I give an opinion on the best way or obtaining facilities in territories under category B i would be grateful if i coulu be assured that these represent the final require ments of the nir Ministry, at all events for a period Ox sa^ two years. A piecemeal method oj. obtaining air laciu-i-tiee from Shaikhs, as I pointed out before, renders a iar from easy task still more difficult, and may also prove more expansive to Bis Majesty's Government. If the information, fox’ » instance, /6*^ - r rani mm* wmmr -3- instance, as to the air facilities at Taxul and Das islands iiad been received by Lie in tine it wouiu have been convenient to have tried to obtain tuem at the same time as the others dealt with by Colonel Loch in his recent negotiations (vile my letter of 22na February already quoted). S. If therefore tnere is any douot as to whetuer axiy further facilities should be added to the *ar hinistry List it would be much preferable that further consideration should be given to this matter. This further consideration may lead to a slight delay in dealing with the facilities under category 3, but in the meantime the Royal Air Force can commence installing those under caoe^oi^, A. sd.

Sir, 00^ ity Eetiruary, 1935 $ % I am coirnnanded ty the Air Cotmcil to refer to their letter S.34954/s.6. of the 18th January, in which they forwarded for the information of Sir Samuel Hoare, their views as to the attitude the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf should he advised to adopt in regard to the improvements the Council desire to make to the existing air facilities in the Persian Gulf with a view to increasing the security of the route, especially for night flying. 2. The Council received just after the despatch of this letter, a copy of Confidential Express Air Mail 16tter No.173 of 1935 dated the 5th January, from the Honourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from which they are glad to learn that Colonel Eowle has advised that the Political Authorities in the Gulf should in the first instance adopt the attitude recommended by the Air Council. The Council, however, are a * little disturbed to observe that Colonel Powle does not appear to be very hopeful of the result of such a policy and that in his view some payment may be necessary for the establishment and security of the airway beacons to be located on the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs, even at existing landing grounds. 3. The Council would be reluctant to make any further payment for air facilities in the Gulf but in the last resort, and if political considerations appeared to dictate it, they would be prepared to reconsider their views in this connection. 4. The Council wish to invite the attention of Sir Samuel Hoare to the list (which was attached to their letter of the 18th T„, | |ECo.

In this connection the Council invite attention to their letter o. 32395/s.6. of the 16th August, 1933, and in particular to paragraph 4 in which they stated that 'for a period of say 18 months no addition should be made to the programme (of air facilities required in the Gulf) save in circumstances of an exceptional character such as cannot at the present time be visualised.' 6. While the Council feel that owing to the rapid advance of aviation, it is at any time extremely difficult to forecast requirements, the period of 18 months has, in any event, now almost elapsed and they would be glad if instructions could be given to the Honourable The Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf to approach the Sheikhs concerned as he thinks best, with a view to securing the additional air facilities and the improvements desired.

As Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, the next stage in the development of the Imperial Air Routes is to equip them for night flying, and with this in view the Council hope to inform the India Office shortly of the particulars of the equipment and organisation which it will be necessary to provide in the Persian Gulf. These will consist of airway beacons, Directional Finding W/T Stations and a Meteorological organisatioc and as far as can be foreseen at present, will in almost every instance be located at air stations already established. 3. The Air Council do not regard such equipment as in the nature of additional facilities which are to be obtained from the Shaikhs but as part of the normal organisation of a civil The Under-Secretary of State, Political Department, India Office, S.W.l. /— “ - air route and of* the oouipment of a civil aerodrome* It may he, however, that when His Majesty's representatives in the Persian Gulf learn of the new proposals they may he inclined to regard them as outside the terms of the agreements already concluded and to feel that they must therefore approach f the Shaikhs anew. The Council hope that Sir Samuel Hoare may see his way to acquaint His Majesty's Representatives in the Persian Gulf with their views and trust that he will agree that permission to improve the equipment of these air stations for night and day and all-weather flying is both unnecessary and inadvisable. They would suggest that the appropriate procedure is to install the beacons, etc., as a matter of course and without raising the subject with the Shaikhs, and in the event of question being raised, to explain that beacons and Wireless Stations are part of the normal organisation of a civil air route for the establishment of which the authority of the Shaikhs has already been obtained. 4.

Air Facilities on i’rueial Coast. !• Owing to the illness of the Residency Agent and of Shaikh oaVd bin ^rktum, they were unable to accompany me to Abu Dhabi and I, therefore, decided to postpone negotiations with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi till after R&amp;mabhan. I discussed the question of beacons with the Residency Agent, but not with anyone else. 8* At Abu Dhabi the frie?idliness of our reception (having come with a geologist and a doctor) was markedly different to the previous occasions on which I have been tnere. In the course of our geological researches, 1 spent a night on a stranaed dhow with Shaikh bhakhbut and his old and experienced uncle. Shaikh Khaiifah bin Znid, and established friendly and informal relations. I hope thet future negotiations will, tnerefore, at any rate start on a basis of /friendliness2 friendliness. 5. At ary farewell call Shaikh Khalifah asked me about the Yas Island Tank question, v/hile Shaikh Shakhbut was absent ivoy. tne room, so I said that x would speak to them privately on his return. We all three withdrew from the majits and I seid that owing to the illness of the Residency Agent and Shaikh Se^id, I had been unable to bring them, but hoped to finish the matter after Rpmadhan. Shaikh Shakhbut, who spoke in a very friendly fashion, said that hw would like in future to deal direct with us himself and not through a third party. I replied that I welcomed this and hoped tnax after Hamadnan the matter would be settled. It may be a little difficult to short circuit Shaikh Sa^d without hurting his feelings, but some arrangement should be possible (for example, if I summon the Residency Agent to Bahrain, we might go to Abu Dhabi direct from here). 4. I found that the Residency Agent, Shaikh Sa*Id (whom I saw separately) and Shaikh Shakhbut all seemed tc regard the agree ment to which they came (see x Tinted better No:C/740-7/2 dated the 11th August 1934) as a firm one on the (not really logical) ground that Shaikh Shnknbut, at their intercession and rather under personal pressure from Shaikh Be ! id, had now accepted the principle of the tank. The Residency Agent was sruch upset at the idea of further bargaining over the payment, because it would reflect on Shaikh Sa ! id and of course himself (though naturally they had no authority to cormit Government). The business is unsatisfactory, but I hope that now that I have made friends with Shaikh Shakhbut and Butikh 4kialifah f it will be possible to get round it once negotiations re-open, he thinks that once tne Yas Island tank business is settled, Shaikh Sh&amp;khbut is likely to give the Abu Dhabi landing ground (owing to tne illness of the Residency Agent /and•2 » and Shsiki'x this question has not yet bet^n broached to him) without further payment. I do not share this view, though it is possible, with &amp; queer character like Shaikh Shakhbut, that the Residency Agent &amp;ay be right. 5. I fear that if we come to an agreement over Yas Island and for a landing ground at i^bu Dhabi with Shaikh Shakhbut and then proceed to erect beacons, v.e shell only have the weary business of the tank over again. Moreover, Shaikh Shakhbut is certain, when we negotiate, to ask whether anything more is wanted - I shall then either have tc say -Yes, beacons', in which case I shs.il be deeply embarrassed end shall nave to forfeit the confidence which I hope that I have won, or I shall have to say 'tfo' and appear in an even worse light later on. Although it may be possible to persuade him that a beacon (like the revolving light at Sharjah) is a reasonable and natural concomitant of a landing ground (though he, like our selves, has always been assured that emergency landing grounds only are wanted), he will, I think, regard it as a special facility. I would, of course, press the navigation argument, but I doubt if it will carry much weight. 6. I apologise for this lengthy explanation of the positicn For future action, I would suggest that I summon the Residency Agent to .Bahrain as soon as possible after Ramadiian and go into the matter with him. My own view as to tactics is to explain to the Residency Agent exactly what is wanted, emphasising tha-c our needs have changed since he ana Shaikh Sa^d went to Abu Dhabi. I would then send him ahead of me to Abu Dhabi with a substantial sum (say Rs.2,000/-) to be used if the situation so develops, as Shaikh Shakhbut 1 s earnest money,(wit n a view to acknowledging acceptance of the principle of c tank and to caving the way for our fuller require ments. This will, I think, have a persuasive effect on Shaikh /Shakhbut4 gay £h6'Klibut and his uncle, ShsiJch Kiiaiifah (who wields much influence). I should then like to be in a position to follow the Residency Agent in a Sloop. 7. I would, however, urge that I be given discretion to spend up to the extrs luaip sum of Rs.?2,000/- and a monthly sum of Rs.200/- mentioned in paragraph 2 of my telegram dated the 5th December. X will try to avoid this additional expenditure, but I particularly do not wish to have any delay in referring to Govern ment once the negotiations have been resumed. 8. I should like to be assured that the beacons will be placed on the landing grounds (.see paragraph 5 of your telegram) and also that these beacons are indeed the last facility required for Abu Dhabi (I hear a rumour of a beacon being wanted at lislul Island as well). X appreciate that it is impossible to call finality to the requirements of so rapidly advancing a science as aerial navigation, but I hope that it will be possible, once these facilities are obtained, to avoid asking for something more, till the Shaikh has had a reasonable time to become familiar with these new ideas. 0.

The Air Officer Commanding has presumably assumed that as we have a landing ground there covered by the Civil Air Agreement, no further permission from the Shaikh is required to erect a beacon. This would appear to be correct. 7. With regard to Yas and Abu Dhabi. If Colonel Loch has been successful in obtaining landing grounds at these places also, then it might be possible to take the line that beacons there also as at Kuwait are part of the normal require ments for a landing ground, and can be erected without any further permission from the Shaikh. (The beacons are obvious ly on a different footing to a petrol store for example which may be regarded as a special facility.)

J.G.Laithwaite Ksquire, The India Office, Lon d or.Ify dear MeClaughry, 5th February 1934. Iv'any thanks for your letter of the 22th January, No. 3.31084/Fart 2, about air facilities in Koweit. We note the views expressed by the Air Officer Coramanding. 2. , Permission for the free use of the existing land ing ground will presumably be covered by the arrangements which tiie Political Resident has been instructed to endeavour to make with the Sheikh of Koweit in regard to civil .and military aerodromes in his territory. 3. As regards additional facilities to meet possible future requirements, the attitude of the Koweit Oil Company is, I think, an important factor. In their conversations with us they have emphasised their desire that we should, so far as possible, have selected any areas we may wish for defence etc. purposes in advance, and while the suggestion made by you the Qatar facilities, that the phrase Wing Commander W.A. kjcClaughry, DSC., MC., DFC., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, r h! o in connection with 'any sites which may/- 2 - may have been selected” In Clause 5 of the Government Agreement should he strengthened, e.g. on the lines 'any sites which may he required”, was discussed with them a few days ago, they took the line that the revised wording would place them in an impossible position. Unless, therefore, the Air Ministry see strong objection, we think it would be desirable to take immediate steps to select the actual sites which will, in the Air Officer Corananding’s opinion, be required near Jhaira and subaihiya. Once the sites have been selected the desirability of acquiring them ana also the site described in (a) of the Air Officer Commanding*s telegram ox 26th January, as an insurance against the future, could be considered. Pending a decision on this point it will probably be desirable not to let it become generally known locally that we may be requiring certain sites in the near future, since if the areas referred to by the Air Officer Commanding are not Government land tte effect may be to put up the price against us. 4- The position in regard to the points dealt with in paragraph 2 of your letter under reply is generally similar to that in regard to Qatar. An assurance has been/1 'been ot)tainea from the Company as regards wireless ana other methods of communication; aifficulty should not presumably arise as regards the point referred to in (b); point (c) is one for consideration, as is point (d); point (e) is a matter for local aiscussion ana agreement of financial terms once any new landing grounds have been acquired; (f) is equally for local aiscussion in the first place, as is (h); the position in regard to (g) is as stated in respect of Qatar in paragraph 5 of my letter No. p.2*727/34 of 1st February. 5. I am sending copies of this letter to 7/arner at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Aamiralty, and Starling at the Petroleum Department. Copies will also go by the next air mail to Fowle, to whom a copy of your letter under reply ana of my letter of 1st February, P.Z.727/34, to you about Qatar, were sent by the air mail of 2nd February.

Almost at once he began to talk of the emergency air facilities at Yas Island, stating that the Royal Air Force were using the Island without his permission. He stated that he did not object to the emergency landing ground but to the petrol stowage, and he would be prepared to negotiate when the tank had been taken away. He was apparently not attracted by compensation. respected the treaty with Great Britain which had been in force for 100 years, but that Great Britain herself had broken faith by infringing his sovereign rights.

As I explained to you, the Air Officer Commanding, in his letter 8. 10604, pursued ouj* point further than we wished to carry it ourselves.

This puts these two aerodromes in e different category from others auch as Yas Island, which are for service use only and which, we suggest, it ia undesirable for Imperial Airways to be given formal permission to use. J&gt;or this reason It seems to ua that it might be misleading to make no mention at all of Imperial Airways under the Kalba or Shines headings.

I read paragraph 3 of A.O.C^ letter to me*h that he v/ishes no reference to be made to Imperial Airways in the list of facilities in respect of any landing grounds in the Persian Gulf, and this, I think, goes much further than Johnstone suggested in his letter, E.589l/ll/91, of the 4th October last. As Imperial Airways Schedule stops at KUWAIT, BAHREIN, SHARJAH and GWADUR, the question of whether or not we include a reference to the use by them of those facilities in our table does not seem to be a matter of great importance, and is hardly likely to give rise to any special difficulties, if or when the question of allowing foreign companies to use the route is considered. Our view, therefore, is that it would probably be best to leave the table as it stands in so far as those places are concerned. KALBA or SHINAS, on the other hand, are in a different category as they are not, nor are they likely to be regular stopping places for Imperial Airways and one but not both of them is required by the Company for emergency purposes only. As far as those places are concerned, therefore, we are inclined to agree with the A.O.C. that it might be best to omit in the table the present refereces to J.G.Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.l. OOPY SENT ^ &amp; NOV * £ -rto use of them by Imperial Airways. ' ^ Will you please let us have your views on the subject and if you agree v/ith what has been said above, I suggest the only amendments necessary in the table ^ are :- -^A-hBA - in column 5 delete the words ' 1 .A. only in ' emergency', and in column 6 delete the words 'required primarily for I.A.' (b) SHIHAS .- In column 5 delete the words 'I.A. only in emergency' and in column 6 substitute the following for the present wording:- required urgently as an emergency landing ground until AAhBA can be made available, when necessity for retention will be reconsidered.' *// jvc k ^Perhaps you will make those amendments in your copy, informing the Political Kesident accordingly.

As stated in the foreign Office letter quoted above it is realised that should an emergency arise Imperial Airways would certainly not hesitate to use any emergency landing grounds, and the same applies to foreign aircraft which may be allowed to use the Arabian Coast route. 3. However, I think it far more logical to omit any reference to Imperial Airways in the table of air facilities and I consider this would comply with the views of the Foreign Office better than if formal permission is granted in the case of Ealba and Shinas only. I therefore recommend that the table be amended to omit any reference whatsoever to Imperial Airways. The Secretary,, Air Ministry, Adastial House, KIHGSV/AY, W.C. 2 .

Iraq to discuss these points further with the Resident, with a view to agreed recommendations being made to which approval coula he given when the time comes hy tne Government of Inaia and H.L.G. This is satisfactory. 2. As regards the list of facilities, a considerable proportion are graded in the highest category. But when this grading is taken with the Air Ministry acceptance of the proposal that the list should he regarded as for practical purposes closed for a period of, say, 18 months, that fact is less material. The Resident, while naturally concentrating on securing at the earliest date facilities covered hy the first category, will use his own discretion as to the times and seasons as which to press the rulers concerned to grant them.

A copy of Air Ministry letter S.32395 dated the 15th August is also forwarded, from which it will be seen that the Air Officer Commanding has been instructed to endeavour to reach agreement with the Political Resident on these points, and also upon the question of what action should be taken in the case of any rulers who may prove obstructive* 3 # The table of facilities required in a revised form has also been forwarded to the Air Officer Commanding, of which a copy is attached, and from which it will be seen that the landing grounds at Shinas, Sohar, Jiwani and facilities for flying boats at one pdnt between Masira and Murtat have been added, together with Murbat itself. i ' r The Air Council agree that the time has arrived when it should be possible to work to a settled programme of develop ment of the air facilities required in this area and also that The Under Secretary of State, India Office, S *W.1. rpcfor a period of say eighteen months, no addition should be made to the programme save in circumstances of an exceptional • - ,5 , v - v 4 ^ v o’ character such as cannot at the present time be visualised* The Council also agree that failure to secure facilities with regard to which negotiations may be conmenced would have most unfortunate results, and that every effort should in future be made to avoid such a contingency. with the ^sidenVs proposals, which should have the effect of avoiding difficulties such as those which have occurred in the the Council are of opinion that the landing ground which has oeen asked for at Kalba is necessary for Imperial Airways as an emergency landing ground on the route between Gwadar and Sharjah, it is too far south fully to meet Imperial Airways* requirements. In these circumstances a landing ground at Kalba will be required as soon as one can be obtained. In which case Shinas can then either be abandoned or placed in category 'C' as an emergency landing groun for Service use. 5 I am to add that the Air Council agree in principle past. ? 6.

I agree entirely with your suggestion, put forward in paragraph 7 of your letter, to divide air facilities into the three categories of 'A' (Vital), 'B'(Important) and 'C' (Convenient). 3. Your para.2 noted. I am convinced that the rulers of the Arab Littoral are gradually realising that our presence in their territory is very profitable for them, and I am inclined to think that we shall be able to obtain our requirements without having to resort to force. 4. My comments on the points raised in paragraph 3 are QATAR (RAIYAU) I consider that the facilities at this place come under Category ,T C'. I am also of opinion that some agreement such as a promise of protection to the Shaikh would be preferable to payment of rent and gifts of rifles and ammunition. See my letter S.11030/8 dated 27th June, 1933, to the Political Agent, Bahrein. ABU DHABI . I regard the facilities here as being in the ”B W Category, as I consider it will be useful to have an aerodrome here in the future for land aircraft flying the direct overland route to MUSCAT. For this purpose a petrol store for approximately 2,000 gallons may be required, which would be constructed at Royal Air Force expense. ABU DHABI ARP YAS ISLAM) . I note that in the future Colonel Loch recommends that a payment of Rs.200 (two hundred) per month, (total), should be paid to the Shaikh for rent of ABU DHABI and YAS combined, which should include necessary facilities and guard at YAS ISLAND. I agree with this. The Hon'ble Political Resident in the Persian Uulf, The Residency, BUSHIRE.YAS ISLAM). It is noted, however, that he suggests payment of arrears of rent for YAS ISLAND at the rate of Bs.200 per month from 8th December, 1930, or a total of Rs.6,200. The position is that we agreed to pay the sum of Rs*400 and rent at the rate of Rs.lOO per month from 12th January 1932, for YAS ISLAND landing ground. Actually the sum of Rs.40C was paid to the Political Agent, leaving Rs.1,900 unpaid to date, but since then nothing has been paid by the Royal Air Force, The condition of the payment of the above sum was that the Shaikh should supply a guard for the landing ground and petrol tank, but no guard has ever been seen and it is a question whether the Shaikh is entitled to any payment at all. DIBAI. This, I consider to be in Category '3'. I have decided that it is not really necessary to erect a petrol store here, but it may be desirable to keep a petrol dhow in the creek provided the Shaikh of Dibai does not make any unreasonable demand for payment for its protection. I would suggest that a monthly payment of Rs.100 per month should be good enough. No moorings will be needed here and no landing ground marked out at present. The Shaikh has already agreed to our having a dhow here. HAS AL KHAIICAH . In view of the Air Ministry’ s decision on this place, I put it in Category 'A'• The only additional facility we require here is the marking of the aerodrome. RAS AL KHAIl'AH has been used by landplanes recently and I have not heard that the Shaikh raised any objections. I consider that a payment of Rs.100 per month is sufficient compensation for rent of aerodromes and the guarding of the dhow, although this may have to be increased, but I do not think more than Rs. 2,500 per annum is justified. KALBA. This I place in Category 'C', since it is unlikely to be of great use to the Royal Air Force or to Imperial Airways. KHOR JARA11A AND RAS AL 5ADD . Both the alighting area at KHOR JARAKA and the aerodrome at RAS AL HADD I place in 'A' Category since these places form an excellent operational base should there be trouble in this district. However, since both the aerodrome and the alighting area are in the Sultan of MUSCAT’S territory and the local inhabitants appear to be friendly, I do not anticipate that our hold here will be subject to question. 5. As you are aware, I am hoping to establish one refuelling base and two emergency landing grounds between iwASIRAH ISLAND and MURBAT • The refuelling base T place in Category 'B' and the emergency landing grounds in Category 'C'. 6. I am sure you will agree that the requirements I have outlined above can be obtained without serious difficulty. Most of the facilities required are already obtained and as regards ABU DHABI I am inclined to think that a sloop will provide a sufficient show of force, although I am prepared-3- (4^ f ^ to consider the co-operation of aircraft at any time you consider it necessary, 7 . I am inclined to disagree in general with the principle of giving large numbers of rifles as presents, although i fully realise that such presents cost us little and may be greatly valued by the Shaikhs, However, T should have thought that the occasional present of a suitably inscribed rifle to the Shaikh himself would serve the purpose. 8 . I am returning to you a copy of the list of air facilities which you attached to your letter. I have amended this list in accordance with the requirements I have outlined above.

The papers are, for practical purposes, self-contained and it is perhaps unnecessary to attach the main file on this subject? 2. The despatch of ,23rd June largely consists |of a detailed plan of campaign worked out by Colonel Loch, the Political Agent, Bahrein, vdio is at present acting as Political..Resident,for the obtaining of the air facilities which may be required on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf, whether on the civil or the strategic air route. Prima facie there is much to be said for action on the lines which Colonel Loch proposes. But it is unnecessary to consider his suggestions in detail at the moment, since we still await the final observations on them of Colonel Fowle, who is anxious (and his view on this point is shared by the Government of India - see their express letter on P.Z.4239/33 flagged) that such action as rray be necessary on them should, if practicable, be postponed until the autumn in view of climatic and other conditions. 3. We may agree with the Government of India as to the desirability of reaching an understanding as to the air facilities to be required in the near future and as to the grading of such facilities in order of priority. We have had many complaints, both private and official, in the past from the political authorities in the Persian Gulf of the difficulties caused to them by sudden demands from the Air Ministry _ 4000 3/32 for/for facilities in particular sheikhdoms and the absence of any definite indication as to the relative known to desire along the Arab littoral of the Gulf. In view of the experience which has now been gained of that littoral from the air standpoint, there shoulCi be no serious difficulty in reaching an understanding in drawing up a list of facilities, accompanied by informally with Colonel Fowle since his return and he ! has expressed in strong terms his hope that the Secretary of State will be prepared to support his reconmendations on this point. He is anxious, if at all possible, that once the list has been drawn up there should be a close season of, say, a year or 18 months, during which the political authorities in yf! j|| the Gulf can endeavour to secure the Air Ministry I desiderata and in which they can be sure that unless r some quite unforeseen situation develops no further M demands will be made upon them. The arguments In favour of action on the so lines are. I think. ■ i*--J / Draft Paper. f’ 2 . u-S-te 33 poli T igal Department, DiiAPT ^TT2R The Secretary, Air Ministry, W.C. 2.

INDIA OFFICE ° °7 ^rdt ~ IZu. 1712a 5000 3.3S I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to refer to the correspondence noted in the margin of which copies have already been sent to the Air Ministry, Foreign Office and Admiralty, on the subject of air facilities on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. 2. The Secretary of State with great interest the valuable suggestions putj^rward by Lt.Col. Loch and iJa^epro visional observations thereon of the Political fasiaant. Ee notes that Col. Fowle would prefer to postpone a aetallod- comment on Colonel Loch's proposals for the moment, but that he is of opinion that such action as may ultimately be found desirable on them should, if practicable, be postpomrd until the autumn of this year. The Secretary of State agrees with the Government of India in accepting the Resident's view on this point. 3. Sir Samuel Hoare directs me at the same time to say that he wishes strongly to support the Resident's suggestion that immediate steps should be taken to reach a decision as to the/the air facilities, strategic and civil, required in the near future in the Arab Sheikhdoms within the sphere of the Persian Gulf Residency and as to the grading of those facilities in order of priority.

Action on these lines, mareo^er, woul^ obviate the difficulty, to which attention has repeatedly been drawn hy the local political authorities, of persuading the Arab rulers concerned to grant at short notice specific facilities. As the Air Council will appreciate, the effect of failure to secure such facilities (as in the recent cases of ^atar and Kalha) is unfortunate not merely from the air standpoint, hut on wider political grounds, am The Secretary/Department, Secretary of State trusts that in the circumstances the Air Council will agree as to the anvantage of action on the lines proposed hy the Political Aesident^ and he would he glad if the information requested in I the Resident’s despatches of 23rd and 26th June, to which reference is made in p&amp;ra.l above, could, if no objection is seen, be furnished at as early a date as conveniently possible for transmission to Bushire. $7 Since the datebf the Resident' despatch of 26th June, arrangements, as the Air Council are aware, have been made to secure an emergency | landing ground at Shinas. The Air Council will no doubt indicate whether, having regard to this, they still desire that an emergency landing ground should be obtained at Kalba as soon as circumstances permit^. 6*.

AIB FACIU^IKS OH THE ARAB COAST . Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have received a long and interesting despatch from Colonel Loch, ^blitical Agent, Bahrain, in connection with the subject of air facilities on the Trucial Coast, where he has recently been touring in one of His Majesty’s sloops. Owing to the ease with which in these days the Tracial Coast can be visited by the 'olitical Agent, Bahrain, in aircraft, whether by Imperial Airways’ machines, or by the kind assistance of the -oyal Air 7 orce, I have demi-offidaily placed that area under the ’olitical Agent. Up to recently as you are aware, it used to be under the 'olitical Resident direct• 2 . Certain features of Colonel Loch’s letter can be suMnarised as follows: (a) He touches on various considerations of a general nature, notably the fact that owing to the haste with which we have had to try and get these facilities, the ^aikhs from whom these requirements were desired have been inclined/-2- /5Y Inclined to assume a stubborn attitude* 'a **«nt bas already been dealt with by His Majesty’s OoTernment and it has now been decided - vide Government of India Express letter Ho.?~169-N/29 of 16th January 1933 - that whenever possible the Resident should be in a position to take his time in carrying out negotiations, (b) Colonel Loch is of opinion that by not being in a position to enforce each demand for air facilities as it was made 'we have imbued the Rulers of the Arab Littoral with a spirit of refusal'. (c) He goes on to say:' It is well to face the fact that the Rulers do not want, and will not at present willingly accept, the frightening innovation of aircraft. It disturbs life as they lead it, and they no doubt sense, though they may not fully realise, that it mnrks the end of their dispensation'. He fears that 'if the present state of affairs is to be remedied, we must face the necessity for imposing our will, even, if need be, by a resort to force'. 3. Colonel Loch, in pursuance of these views, suggests the following tactics should be employed with the Shaikh of each place from whom air facilities are required ' QATAR . In my Repress letter »o,C/208 dated the 18th Tune 1933 I have asked for certain information and for sanction to certain expenditure, in the hope that T may be able to arrange for an emergency landing ground at Raiyan through an intennediary. I would only say here that I trust that I shall be permitted to make an annual payment (not exceeding Re.1,200/. a year), if it proves necessary,/F 3— X i X “necessary, and also to prlvt a present of up to tnenty rifles and two thousand rounds; because if the f5hail&amp;i of ^atar accepts an emergency landing ground, it would provide ue ritb or use rl argument on the Crucial Coast, If my attempt to arrange matters should fall throat, I think that we should reconsider the question of Qatar very carefully before taking any action, Kot only is Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qaaim’s standing quite different to that of the Chiefs of the Trueial Coast, but the position is complicated by the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited and by the possibility of difficulties with the Sa’udi Arab Government 1 *, ( I have asked Colonel Loch to suspend action with regard to Qatar for the present,) “ ABIT DHABI , I would suggest that I should proeeed to Abu TJhabi in a Sloop, if ths Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf will be kind enough to assist, accompanied by an officer of the ^oyal Air ^rce qualified to select the landing ground, and by the 'Residency Agent, At the same time a Victoria (or perhaps two) might stand by at Bahrain, ready with the men, tools and materials (including water) needed to make the marks on the ground , the essential point being that we shouldjnot waste time and give rise to further difficulties by demanding active assistance in the sunply of materials from Abu T*habi. I would then approach the Shaikh and give him one further opportunity of co-operating# If that failed, I would oxplaln that the matter is one of such Importance that the Government must insist on the ground being marked and instruct him to supply transport for the officer of the Royal Air Dbrce to go out and examine the ground. At this point it would be useful if a second Sloop could arrive on the scene, as a proof tha+ we were in earnest. Once the sits had been selected, we should go out to the place with a guiding mark of white sheeting,/f-o sheeting* The Victorias nould (on being summoned by wireless from the Sloop) come and complete the work, wh ch sheeting* would then he placed In the charge of the Shaikh* I woul&lt; try to persuade the Shaikh to come out and see for himself how email a renuest we were making. I would beg that I might he authorised at the earnc time (i) to assure him of a payment of ^s.200/- a month for Yas Island and the emergency landing ground, (ii) to pay him then and there arrears from li the date of occupation of the Vas Island site (i*e*Hs*SOO/- a month from 8th Becemher 1930), and (iii) make him a personal L present of ten rifles and one thousand rounds of ammunition M * ' PIBAI . I would suggest that I he authorised to proceed to Dibai in a Sloop with an officer of the Hoyal Air ’Force and an officer of the Chief litogineer's Department with the masons, material and equipment needed for placing the buoys and constructing the petrol store. As in the case of Abu Dhabi, it is desirable to avoid the complication of asking for local help, and it would be wise not to risk embroiling the Shaikh of Sharjah in the matter by bringing material or men from there. If a second Sloop could be present at the beginning, it would be useful as showing that we were in earnest. I would then explain to the Shaikh that the facilities were regarded by (rover ment as essentii and that they proposed to construct the tank and lay the buoys, which would be placed in his chargs; that he would be paid ''s.£50/- a month in return for his giving the facilities U and for his responsibility for guarding them and that we would give him a present of twenty rifles and two thousand or from such date as the records in the Desidency of the early proceedings may show to be justified*.5./ 'thousand round b of am unition'. * RAT&gt; AL KHA T HAH » I nould eu^geat action on the lines of that recommended at T&gt;ihai** The payment of ’to.SSO/- a month might be continued and a present of five rifles and five hundred rounds be made.' ' KALB A , I do not know Aether facilities are still required there and it is outside my province to make recommendations, but I venture to suggest that similar action to that taken at al Khaimah might be considered there'. 4. With regard to the cost Colonel Loch eetiraates as follows: 'The recurring ooet of the subsidies in rupees amounts to:- Hgn&amp;Ay yearly, Qatar 1 ,200. Abu Whabi SCO 2,400. Bibai PRO 3,000. Has al Khalmah 220 ft. 3*P, In addition there would be the cost of any subsidy which might be given at Kalba. As initial expenditure there would be the coot of the presents of rifles and ammunition ( up to, e^, sixty rifles and six thousand rounds), and I would suggest that the Political Agent be authorised to spend up to Re.i # 000/« in cash or presents, should necessity arise. I venture to think that, if we achieve our object and extricate ourselves from our difficulties, this expendJ ture is a email price to pay'#&lt;jy Cg) 6 # Colonel Loch goes on to say thrt he does not think that it would he neceesary to resort to force hut that nerertheless we should consider what action can he taken in the event of obstruction. He is, naturally, of the opinion that we should avoid ’fire action’ and suggests various methods of bringing indirect pressure to hear, Including the withdrawal of shipping facilities, and if still no satisfactory result was obtained, the institution of a blockade, permitting no movement by sea to or from the port concerned, and in the case of Behai, from Sharjah as well. Colonel Loch then writes: 'I would suggest finally that discretion should be given to the Senior Naval Officer on the spot, in consultation with the Political Agent, to use fire action if imperatively necessary in the event of a party being interfered with while executing the works**. ^ith regard to the time at which action on the above lines might commence. Colonel Loch says^The late Shaikh Sir ’Isa bin ’All al Khalifah of Bahrain once said to me that we were foolish to try to do business with Arabs in + e hot weather, for it was neither their custom nor was it commonsense, as evexyone was cross at that season. I would suggest, both for Shaikh ’Isa’s reason and for the sake of our OT/n oersonnel, that we should refrain from taking action till the cold weather, and in the meantime complete our preparations in detail’’. 7. I shall have an opportunity shortly of discussing the whole matter with Colonel Loch, and refrain at present commenting on his proposes, beyond agreeing with him ihr action should • if practicable - be postponed until the Autumn./Autumn* In the meantime, however* I attach a complete list of air facilities, both etratepical and civil, at preeent required in the territories of the Arab Sheikhdoms under this Residency* Some of these facili f ics have already been obtained and others still await attainment* With regard to the items of the latter class, bos*3 (c) and (d), 4, 8 (a), 6, 8, and 9, I would be glad if His Majesty's Government could be asked to indicate on their relative importance* I venture to suggest that from the air point of view they might be divided into three classes: A vital, B important, and C convenient* I would also be glad to know ufoether the above list represents all the air facilities In my area, strategical and civil, which will be required, or Whether any others are contemplated for the future* Considerable experience both of ^oyal Air fforce and Civil requirements has now been gained and presumably it is possible to make a definite statement on this point* It will obviously be easier for me to deal with the problem if I know exactly What are the limits of the air facilities required* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, the Air Officer Commanding,'Trag Comnand, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf division* I have the honour to be.

The file therefore contains a number of lists (some of which are categorised by priority) prepared by the Air Ministry outlining British requirements for navigation beacons, wireless transmissions sets, direction finding sets, moorings for flying boats etc; the lists prepared by the Air Ministry are revised over time to reflect changing requirements, for example the introduction of night flying. Also covered in the file is the establishment of a petrol dhow at Dubai in 1934 (see folio 402 for a copy of the agreement), and consideration in 1938 of arrangements for the provision of fuel at Ras al Khaimah [Ra's al-Khaymah] for Imperial Airways in cases of emergency.Another topic featured in the file is the introduction of a flying boat service by Imperial Airways in 1937, and the selection of a suitable stopping point along the Arabian Coast. The selection process is covered, which includes consideration of Dubai (also spelt Debai and Dabai), Ras al Khaimah, and Umm al Qaiwain [Umm al-Qaywayn] as potential sites. This process culminates in the Dubai Commercial Air Agreement (1937): see folios 223-226 for a copy of the agreement with both Arabic and English translation. This includes an agreement respecting security arrangements for passengers transferred between the alighting area at Dubai and their accommodation at Sharjah: see folio 199 for an English translation of the agreement. Further correspondence relating to its renewal in 1943 can also be found in the file. The prospects for the future use of Dubai and Sharjah, as of 1946, are also briefly discussed at the end of the correspondence.Material related to a survey of Sharjah Creek in 1939 and Dubai Creek by Bernard Whitteron in 1941 can be found between folios 36-57. This includes sketch maps the two creeks: Dubai (folio 48) and Sharjah (folios 53, and 55-56). It has been included in consideration of possible engineering work to enhance their navigability and hence their utility for flying boats.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Bahrain (Tom Hickinbotham, Hugh Weightman, and Reginald George Alban), officials of the Air Ministry, and officials of the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Seaplane bases</topic></subject><subject><topic>Dubai Commercial Air Agreement (1938)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Facilities</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000204#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
