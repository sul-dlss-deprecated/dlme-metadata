Abdulla has been made over to the Commander, H.M.S. “ Lapwing ” with the request that he will hand him over to the Residency, Bushire. Statement. Abdulla, Abyssinian by race, a man of about 30 years of age, appeared in the Agency this morning and states that he is in the house of Abdulaziz bin Fahad who lives near Haji Muhammad Ali Marafi. He has been with him three years and has been married to a female slave of his, by whom he has a son He was, according to his own statement, stolen away from Abyssinia and brought to Jedda, Mecca, and overland here. Last year, the French Consul at Berbera set him free and his manumission paper is at Berbera. His master persuaded him to return on a false promise made to him that he should be a free man and allowed to work for his wife and child. As soon as he reached Koweit his master claimed him again as a slave and now proposes to sell him. He’asks my assistance to help him out of Koweit, proposes to leave Koweit altogether abandoning his wife and child and to go to Berbera where he has a sister and other relatives. 8th June 1907. S. G. KNO)Q, Major, Political Agent, Koweit. Note. Abdulaziz bin Fahad, an old man^of about 60 years of age, came at once in reply to my summons. Ijead over to'him the statement of Abdulla. He said that the statement regarding the French Consul was a lie, but that Abdulla s statement was otherwise true in the main, so far as it went. He added, however that the man had been a trusted servant who had proved dishonest and that he had told him this morning that he did not want him any longer. I said that it seemed that nothing more now seemed to be required, as both parties desired a parting. Abdulaziz replied that the only thing seemed to be that the man should divorce his wife. This Abdulla agreed to do and in my presence and in that of the following witnesses : Abdur Rahman bin Buti, Furaj, and Awayd,• 5 s 2 Chaprassis, appointed Abdulaziz bin Fahad, his master, his agent for the purpose. Through the case, Abdulaziz behaved with the utmost moderation and even liberality. Fie pointed out what was perfectly true that his slave was better dressed than himself. Order. The above compromise was arrived at without the slightest pressure on either side. Abdulla will be conveyed to-day to H.M.S. “ Lapwing ” and the Commander requested officially by letter to give him a passage to Bushire. A letter should also be sent to the Resident, Bushire, praying that he will grant the usual manumission certificate. Abdulla states that if he can be taken out of this place, he will find his own way to Berbera.

With reference to my letter No. 275, dated the 8th June 1907, in the case of slave Abdulla, I have the honour to state that this morning, the slave informed me that he did not want to leave Koweit until the Autumn, when he would sail in one of the trading buggalows. 2. I told him that he stopped here in peril of being interfered with, and that he must not come and complain to me as he had been given a fair chance of obtaining his liberty. 3. I have now the honour to request that, if you see fit, the usual manu mission paper may be sent to me. A descriptive roll of Abdulla is forwarded herewith.

KNOX, Major, Political Agent, Kmeil. . \ Copy of a letter No. tygo, dated 26th June igoy^from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the Political Agent, Koweit. I have the honour to refer to your letters Nos. 275 and 282, dated 8th and 10th instant, respectively, regarding the case of the negro Abdulla. 2. It is always the custom to refer to the territorial authorities at all events pro forma, in connection with the manumission of slaves, and I think Sheikh Mubarek will inevitably resent your summoning subjects of his to your presence^r~ and disposing of such cases without consulting him, as would appear to have been the course followed in this instance. The Abyssinian in question does not complain of ill-treatment and appears to have been dishonest, and to have no serious fear of coming to harm, or he would not for his own convenience elect to remain several months in Koweit. In such circumstances I think the case will be met by the slave receiving a manumission paper on arrival here and on his undertaking not to return to Koweit. I notice that one previous case is on record which was disposed of by Captain Trevor in my absence {vide this office letter No. 1816, dated 3rd Decem ber 1905), and in which a manumission certificate was sent for the wife of one of your Consular servants ; but that case was hardly on all fours with this and the general question is one in regard to which you should proceed with considerable caution and in consultation with the Sheikh, who, it must be remembered, has at present no Slave Trade Treaty with us. Copy of a letter No. 374, dated 14th July iQOf, from the Political Agent, Koweit, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. A I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1390, dated 26th June 1907, in the case of the negro Abdulla. 2. This case has now settled itself, for the negro has, of his own free will, returned to his master who seems to be a humane man and will, I have small doubt, treat him well. 3. I have been somewhat reluctant to refer slave cases to Sheikh Mubarek ever since my Chuprassi, who was waiting outside, informed me that in one case w r here I personally took a slave, who had been freed by the Basra Turkish authorities and then again kidnapped and brought to Koweit, before Sheikh Mubarek, the Sheikh’s servants spent the time occupied by the interview in speculating whether the slave would be put to death or merely flogged and imprisoned. In no case that I have referred to the Sheikh have I ever seen the slave a second time or been able to discover what has become of him. 4. In these circumstances, it would perhaps be as well to refer all refugee slaves direct to the Sheikh and leave them free to follow the advice given at their discretion. I would solicit the favour of instructions as to whether this course of action commends itself to you. Copy of a letter No. iq6o, dated the 8th September 1 goft from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the Political Agent, Koweit. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 374, dated 14th July 1907, and note that the negro Abdulla no longer desires a manumission certificate. 2. Seeing that the position was that stated in paragraph 3 of your letter the details should have been reported at the time and would have been referred to Government. As it is there is no material on which I could ask Government to base instructions. Meanwhile the course which commends itself to me is that until our relations with the Sheikh are on a more definite footing you should discourage negroes from taking bast with you as far as practicable ; but that when they do you should warn the Sheikh of the fact, ask him to enquire into the case and admit the presence of yourself or your representative at the joint hearing, and if the case is obviously one of real slavery and cruelty ask him to acquiesce in the issue of manumission certificate. If he does not prove amenable to your influence and explanations in the matter, then you should report the case in detail and I will refer it for the orders of the Government. G. C. B.

The Government of India will understand that the fact that a negro only has to run over to Bunder Abbas or Bahrein to get a manumission certificate on his own ex parte statement is almost as much calculated to cause resentment in the Sheikh's mind as the manumission of slaves by our Political Agent In oweit itself without reference to him. Our ultimate object in pursuing the philantrophic policy which we do in regard to the manumission of slaves is to secure the greatest good of the greatest number and this end can best be served by gradually bringing the Sheilchs of Koweit tinder our civilising influence in this as well as other directionsMb*. direotiono. 'rhl«j being go, I am of opinion that the procedure best adapted to the circumstances is that recommended by Major Knox namely that negroes taking refuge at our Agencies at other rorts in the Gulf should be consigned by the first opportunity to the Political Agent for inquiry and dfcnnosal in communica tion with Sheikh Kub&amp;reg, If the Government of Indio concur, I request perm!scion to inform the Agencies concerned in that sense, and aim to let Gheikh ubarek know what has been decided, the Political Agent informing him at the same time of the views of Government as expressed in their letter Ho, 4418~' : ♦B., above ouotod* I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, ( ®d } I 5 ** • GOX* 'ajor.

I am sorry to trouble you my friend but the matter is serious and cannot be passed over. Three inhabitants of Koweit Salem slave of Mohamed bin Abdulla el Hejazi,, Mohamed el Howeik and Ahmed Mohamed Bozeineh, imported a month ago 7 (5 male and 2 female) slaves from Koweit to Debai for sale. Fortunately the Residency Agent on the Arab Coast heard about it and succeeded in securing the slaves. It has since transpired that Mohamed el He^azi has rented a house in Debai for the purpose of carrying on his nefarious traffic (in slaves) in which he has been in the habit of indul ging. During my recent tour to the Arab Coast I took the oppor tunity of speaking strongly to the Chief of Debai about this matter and told him that I would also complain to you against your offending subjects referred to above. Now my friend I look to you to punish Mohamed el Hejazi who is the principle offender in an exemplary way and shall hope to hear from you that you have done so. He will not be allowed at Debai. I have no doubt that you will take prompt measures against the above mentioned Mohamed el Hejazi.I have duly received your favour dated 1st Ramazan 1328 (6th September 1910) in which yon order me to inflict severe punishment on those who have ventured to sell slaves at Debar, viz, Salem slave of Muhammad bin Abdullah -el-Hejazi, Muhammad -el -Howe i k and Ahmed bin Muhammad Buzeinah, stating that it has been understood by you that the persons who had tahen part in that serious business imported five male 'y^-o-uTravle and two female slaves from Koweit. he extent of my loyalty and fidelity towards the High British Government is obvious to you and yon are aware of my endeavour to prevent ail what is against their will and of my being watchful to obstruct all that is con trary to law and adverse to conscience; and especially in regard to slave traffic I inflict the most severe punishment. But the persons whose names are shown by you in your favour are not inhabitants of Koweit. Salem, the slave of Muhammad bin Abdullah-el-Hejazi is now remaining at bebai with his master and they have not the least in terest at Koweit. As regards Muhammad-el-Howeik and Ahmed bin Muhammad Buzeinah, they are inhabitants of hi-Hassa and have also no interest at Koweit. I have no doubt that your sense of justice does not require me to give punishment to anyone besides those remaining in my side or to those who live in remote re gions. In accordance with your order, however, I have given strigent orders which will be inforced against any. of them who may come ho my town. And my town will, God willing, be guarded against any proceedings contrary to your •..—To Ho &amp;&amp;Q/0 Ot 19X2. British Residency and Consulate-General, Koweit.

Attention is drawn to the fact that a slave does not properly speaking become a British subject or protege merely by reason of his iiaving been freed by or through a u.a British CITicsr. The British Manumission Certificate is nothing more than it purports to he, as now worded, and the hearer of one is only entitled to our assistanae in the case of interference with his liberty.

(vii). In cases of persons born in slavery (known as 'Muwallid” or domestic slaves) good offices can only be given in circumstances of gross ill-treatment with a view to the extraction of a guarantee from their Masters that the ill-treatment shall cease. They are in no case en - titled to a manumission certificate; on the other hand we .are under no obligation to assist their masters to re cover them. It should be remembered in this connection that domestic slavery is not prohibited in Tun-key under the Brussels Act. A domestic slave is one bom in slavery, one or both of the parents being at the time bonded slaves.' (viii). Emancipated slaves, who can work as field labourers porters, etc., but not those of the domestic class, may be sent to Zanzibar in direct communication with His Majesty’s Agent and Consul-General at that place;in such cases all charges, which should hK of course be kept as low as possible and should not exceed r s.50/- in each case,xw±± willwill 'be borne by Government.

Part I. Notes for guidance on Persian shore of Persian Gulf. Authority. The authorities for the manumission of slaves on which we work on the Persian Coast are ;— (i) The Slave Agreement with Persia of 1882 (Aitchison, volume XII, page 97 ). (ii) The Brussels Act, 1890 (Hertslet, volume XIX, page 278 ). In regard to the former, it has been held that the engagements of the Persian Government are not limited to the case of negroes, but also cover the case of enslaved Mekranis or other indigenous persons. Grounds for Manumission. (i) Enslavement after March 1882 , the date of execution of Slave Trade Agreement with Persia. (ii) Gross ill-treatment by master, in case of individual enslaved before 'Treaty. Procedure. Slave cases fall under four categories :— (i) Slaves of Persian masters domiciled in Persia. These should be referred officially to the Local Government or Karguzar with a Consulate representative, if necessary, and a statement of the case and a manumission certificate obtained from the Local Government, or the Karguzar, on the strength of which a British manumission certificate is issued and the Persian one filed. We cannot ordinarily manumit without the consent of the Persian author ities, but if the slave is not entitled to his freedom or if his title to be manu mitted is doubtful, His Majesty’s Consular Officer should move the Local Government, or the Karguzar to obtain, or himself obtain, a guarantee for good treatment from the slave’s master and induce the slave to return to his owner on the strength of it. In instances of doubt or if the Local Government or the Karguzar make unnecessary difficulty, the case should be referred to the Residency. (ii) Slaves from Maskat, Bahrain, Kuwait or Trucial Coast. Political Officer should refer to Residency, giving the fullest possible details and permitting the slave to remain in the Consulate meanwhile. (iii) Slaves of masters who are domiciled in Persian territory, hut who are under British protection. Case should be enquired into and dealt with on its merits {but without the intervention of the Persian authorities). (iv) Slaves of masters who are domiciled in Persian territory, but who are not under British protection. Case should in tire first instance be dealt with in communication with the Consul of the owner of the slave if one is present, otherwise the local authorities should be called upon to act as in the case of slaves of Persian masters; vide (i), supra. (v) Slaves taking refuge in British territories at Basidu, or at Jask, Kan jam, SfC. There being no responsible political officer present this practice should not be encouraged, but when slaves have so taken refuge, a manumission certificatet: 2 should be issued, if deserved, by the Consul concerned after enquiry, without the intervention of the Persian authorities, but subject to reierence to the Resi dency in case (ii) above. MANUMISSION OF SLAVES. Part II. Notes for guidance on Arabian shore of Persian Gulf. I.—Kuwait. Authority. We have no Slave Trade Treaty with the Chief of Kuwait, and no general orders have been issued by Government. Procedure. Negroes should be given no encouragement to take refuge at the Agency Correspondence ending with Foreign Department lu the CclS6 of a slave belonging to a letter No. 44,18 E.-B., dated the nth November master domiciled in Kuwait, the Political 190 J, and snbsaqnen. demi-offidal correspond*,*. Ag0nt a( . Ms discretionj dec l ill9 to intervene. When circumstances make this course difficult the case should be reported to and discussed with the Shaikh of Kuwait, with a view to reconciling slave and his master. If the case is one of real cruelty tho Shaikh should if feasible be invited to acquiesce in his manumission. Reference to higher authority need only be made in flagrant cases in which the Shaikh has failed to give reasonable relief. In the case of a slave belonging to a master not domiciled in Kuwait the slave should ordinarily be passed on to Bushire, or, if this is not practicable, a report of the case should be forwarded to the Residency for orders, the slave being given protection in the meanwhile. II.— Bahrain. Authority. Engagement of 1856 with the Chief of Bahrain (Aitchison, page 158 , volume XII). Procedure. 1 . All negroes claiming to be slaves and seeking manumission are received under the protection of the Agency. Males are lodged in the Agency premises under the charge of the guard. Women are as a rule put up outside in the quarter of the Free Slaves, for which they make their own arrange ments. 2. There is only one exception to the grant of refuge to slaves, and that is in the case of those hailing from Kuwait. There are objections in such cases to charging to Government the cost of the passage of a negro sent back to Kuwait; the best plan is to endeavour to avoid the necessity of doing so by informing the slave that he cannot be given a manumission certificate and that if he remains in the Agency and his master claims him, he will have to be sent to Kuwait in order that his case may be enquired into, and that his best course under the circumstances is to make himself scarce. Kuwait slaves are, therefore, not considered in what follows. 3 . Slaves fall under two classes according to whether their masters reside in Bahrain, or abroad. . .3 In the first case, that of “Bahrain Slaves ”, each application is dealt with in accordance with the principle laid down in Foreign Department letter No. 3551 E.-B., dated 4 th September 1905 , in which the attitude of Govern ment in regard to the treatment of slavery in Bahrain was defined. In this letter the Government of India laid down the following principles for the guidance of the Political Agent:— ( 1 ) That no effort should he spared to detect and suppress fresh importa tions of slaves into the island. ( 2 ) That in the case of newly-imported slaves or of slaves who have been subjected to ill-treatment by their masters, every facility should be afforded them for obtaining manumission papers. ( 3 ) That, save in case of ill-treatment, no encouragement to apply for their freedom should be offered to the numerous slaves who are reported to have been long domiciled in the island. ( 4 ) That in the event of slaves of long domicile applying of their own accord for manumission, each case should be considered on its merits, due regard being had to the period which may have elapsed since importation, the reasons assigned for not claiming manumission at an earlier date, the treatment accorded in the past by the slave’s master, the owner’s willingness to furnish guarantees for proper treatment in the future, and, finally, the importance on general grounds of avoiding any widespread unrest among those who have acquiesced in their lot and whose sudden manumission in considerable numbers might constitute a serious source of embarrassment. The Shaikh is only consulted, and only wishes to be'consulted, in special cases: in cases of deadlock or particular difficulty, reference should be made to the Eesidency. By general consent the year 1895 (“ The year of Zubarah ”) is taken as the criterion for determining whether importation is “ new ” or “old ”. 4 . In the second case, that of “ Foreign Slaves ”, chiefly from Trucial Oman, Katar and Turkish Arabia, the applicants’ statements are taken and reference is made to the Political Resident. In a few cases in the past, however, the masters have turned up and have consented to the grant of Manumission Certificates which have accordingly been issued, to save time, by the Bahrain Agency. In such cases the master is usually seeking to record a claim and to enable him to establish his rights, asserts that the man has never been his slave or has lono- since been manumitted. This may sometimes be true, but it is usually expedient to strengthen the “slave’s” position by giving him a Manumission Certificate. Occasionally a foreign slave comes to terms with his master and voluntarily returns with him. As a general rule, however, all Foreign Slave cases should be referred to the Political Resident and disposed of in accordance with instructions received from him. III.— Maskat. Authority. • ; Treaty with the Sultan of Maskat, 1873 (Aitchison, volume XII, para graph 230 ). Manumission Certificates are only granted with the acquiescence of the Sultan after joint investigation by His Highness and the Political Agent. His Highness is not a party to the Brussels Act of 1890 . Trocedure. When a slave applies for freedom at the Agency his statement is taken down in writing. He is then sent to the Sultan with the Agency Munshi for the purpose of verifying his statement made at the Agency and of obtaining the consent of His Highness to his freedom. The Sultan after questioning the 'j :slave either informs the Munshi that the slave may be freed, when he finds him to be of recent importation or of date subsequent to the Treaty ot Ibid, 01 in doubtful cases, i.e .,when the date of the slave’s importation ^ cannot be clear y ascertained, His Highness requests that the slave may be detained for from 10 to 15 days pending further investigation or the arrival of his master. In the now rare cases of slaves imported before 1873 claiming freedom, the Sultan is not asked to agree to their manumission unless cruelty or inhuman treatment is proved, in which case freedom is given with the consent of the Sultan ; otherwise when slaves not entitled to freedom under the treaty, appear to be well fed and clothed and in good condition, they are returned to their masters bv the Sultan, who causes the masters to sign a bond by which they undertake to treat the slaves thus returned with kindness. In the event of British Indian subjects or subjects of Native States taking refuge in the Maskat Agency from a state of pseudo slavery, their free dom has been demanded, as of right, from His Highness and admitted by him as a matter of course, on the principle that the reduction of such persons to a state of slavery can under no circumstances be legal. Of this category the most likely case to occur is that of indigent Baluchis from Kalat-Mekran. IV.— Trtjcial Coast. Juthority. Agreement of 1847 , re-affirmed in the case of the Chiefs of Shargah and Abu Dhabi in 1873 (Aitchison, volume XII, pages 178 and 184 ). Procedure. Certificates are granted by or on the specific authority of the Resident after investigation, on report by the Native Residency Agent, and after consideration of the views of the Shaikh concerned when such are put forward. Geveral Notes. (i) Experience shows that there is a disposition to use the word “ slave” as a synonym for “ negro” in correspondence. This should be avoided. There is a large free negro population in the Gulf and it does not at all follow that because a man is a negro he is necessarily a slave, nor is the converse the case, riz.i that a slave is necessarily a negro. He may be a Mekrani or an individual of other denomination. (ii) If a slave has served his master for a long time, the probability is that the cause of his desire for freedom is of recent origin, and as it is very seldom ttmt a negro slave can really be repatriated in practice, it is often more in his interest that a reconciliation be effected between master and slave by the execution of an undertaking from the former to meet the slave’s wishes in some particular respect and treat him better. (iii) As regards negroes who claim to he slaves, care should be taken to ascertain that they are really bonded slaves and not free men and pearl divers who have run away to evade the liabilities which they so readily incur. If of the former category they should be dealt with as above indicated, hut if the latter, arrangements should be made whenever possible to have the claims against them decided by a Salifa Court, according to the usages of the pearl diving industry. In this connection reference is invited to the Trucial Coast Pearl Divers * Not with this. Agreement, 1879 (copy attached*). (iv) Sub-offices should not correspond in this connection direct with the Residency Agent at Shargah except informally and on purely routine matters. Gases involving discussion should be referred to this Residency. (v) Attention is drawn to the fact that a slave does not properly speaking become a British subject or protege merely by reason of his having been freed by or through a British officer. The British Manumission Certificate is nothing more than it purports to be, as now worded, and the bearer of one is'3 only entitled to our assistance in the case of interference with his liberty. The impression which appears to exist in some ports that a British manumitted slave becomes a British subject ipso facto^ may be in the slave’s interests and need not be actively dispelled, hut it will not hold water if challenged. There is no objection, however, to giving a deserving individual holding a British manumission certificate, friendly offices as a special case and to the extent to which the local authorities will accept them. (vi) Subsistence allowance at the rate of not more than four annas a day may be granted to slaves whose cases are under consideration, at the discretion of the Political Officers. The cost of food and of repatriation when necessary should he drawn on a separate hill and attached to the monthly cash account sent to the Comptroller, India Treasuries, Calcutta. (vii) In cases of persons born in slavery (known as “ Muwallid ” or domestic slaves) good offices can only be given in circumstances of gross ill-treatment with a view to the extraction of a guarantee from their masters that the ill-treatment shall cease. They are in no case entitled to a Manumission Certificate; on the other hand we are under no obligation to assist their masters to recover them. It should be remembered in this connec tion that domestic slavery is not prohibited in Turkey under the Brussels Act. A domestic slave is one horn in slavery, one or both of the parents being at the time bonded slaves. (viii) Emancipated slaves, who can work as field labourers, porters, &amp;e., hut not those of the domestic class, may be sent to Zanzibar in direct com munication with His Majesty’s Agent and Consul-General at that place ; in such cases all charges, which should of course be kept as low as possible and should not exceed Es. 50 , in each case, will be borne by Government. The funds required may be drawn on separate bills and submitted with the monthly account to the audit officer concerned. Emancipated slaves may, if necessary, be sent by native craft, sailino' under the British flag to Zanzibar, His Majesty’s Agent at that place being advised by post of their despatch; if, however, native sailing craft are not available, emancipated slaves may be sent to Zanzibar via Bombay by steamer, the cost, which should not exceed about Rs. 50 , being debited as described above [note (vi)]. The above procedure can be applied to all ports under the Persian Gulf Residency. (ix) Whilst a slave from Persia or from the Arabian shore of the Gulf, not otherwise entitled to his freedom, becomes ipso facto free on setting foot in British India, it has been held that if he returns of his own free will to the Poreign Department letter No. 1647 E.-A., dated place where he was formerly domiciled, the 6th September 1892. revei q s to his original status of slavery. (x) It was held in 1896 by the Advocate-General to the Government of Bombay in the case of the seizure of a slave dhow on the high seas by Captain E, G. Beville, Political Agent, Maskat, that the capture was probably illegal because section 3 of the Slave Trade Act of 1873 only authorises seizure by the Commander or Officer of any of His Majesty’s ships. (xi) Refund of expenditure .—When a slave is restored to his owner, either because he is not entitled to manumission or as the result of a reconci liation effected between him and his master, the expenses of returning him (including cost of his feed and keep) should be notified direct to the Consular Officer concerned with a view to its recovery from the owner. In the case of refugees from the Trucial Coast the cost is treated as a first charge on the man’s earnings and will be recovered and refunded direct by the Residency Agent in due course.

Foreign Department letter No. 918 E.-A., dated the 8th May 1903 . § i asa^—-(ii) If In both 6 (xii) Should civil claims or criminal complaints be preferred against a refugee, as sometimes occurs, the following procedure should be observed— (a) Civil claims— (i) If the claim is connected with pearling transactions, it should be referred to the Salifa Court at the place where the transaction took place. it is an ordinary claim for a loan, &amp;c., it should be referred to a Civil Court of a Kazi, preferably a Kazi acceptable to both parties. cases a representative of the Agency or Consulate concerned should be present. (b) Criminal complaints— The refugee should first be freed if he or she is entitled to freedom and then the complaint should be enquired into and settled un officially, if possible. If this cannot be done, the case should be referred to a Shera or Consular Court or the local Adliyeh according to the nationality of the complainant. the local court a representative of the Agency or Consulate should be present at the enquiry. should be borne in mind, however, that no claim for debt can lie against a person undoubtedly in state of bonded slavery. In the case of minors released from slavery, both in their own interests and in order to save expense, the Political Agent may at his discretion consign individuals during the years of their minority to the guardianship of approved applicants, almost invariably Christians, to be brought up as domestic servants, the said applicants executing a bond in which they guarantee to produce their charges whenever required and give such other undertakings in respect of them as the particular circumstances of the case may render expedient.

This Jarwah whose full name he does not know apparently put her up for sale on the night of the 24th inst.

Usual ending.( 24 ) Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No* 66-5/191-IIL, dated the 12th January 1928. In continuation of my letter No. T.-17, dated tlie 17th December 1927 [Serial No. (15)], on the subject of the statement of the Assistant Public Prosecutor, Karachi, regarding the prevalence of slave traffic in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to State that the statement in question was made on two grounds.— (1) The few cases of which reports have been male to me and in which I have taken action. [The case on trial in the Karachi Courts was in connection with a boy whose freedom I had obtained from the Arab Coast (Serial Nos. 4 and 7). I have in the past year obtained the freedom of three such boys who had been kidnapped from Karachi and I have news of one other only whom up to date I have been un able to trace,] ( 2 ) The statement of the freed slave made in Karachi to the effect that he had seen 15 or 16 such boys when employed on the pearl banks. As regarns No, 1 . A few individual cases occur and as will be seen we have through the Residency Agent at Shargah recovered three out of four boys whose disappearance has been reported to us. With regard to ground No. 2 : I think the statement is an exaggeration. There may be individual cases of which we do not hear, but they orn only be rare. I am nevertheless instructing all Consuls and the Political Agents of Bahrain and Kuwait to have careful enquiries made into the matter. I have only received reports of five Baluchis being sold during the previous year ; while my reports cannot possibly keep trace of all the sales from Persian Baluchistan to the Batineh Coast they are sufficient to show that, though individual cases occur, there is no such traffic as to produce a lucrative trade as suggested. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran.^r (Received with Bushire endorsement No. 65-5j 191-1II, dated the 12th January 1928.) Letter erom the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulp, to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, No. 5—64-5/191-111, dated the 12th January 1928. * • 1 I have the honour to state that in an accompanying despatch to the Govern ment of India No. 66-5/191-III, dated the 12th January 1928 [Serial No. (24)], I report with reference to the general slave question that there is little traffic in slaves in the Persian Gulf. I am, however, bringing the following incidents to your notice in order that should you desire you may be in a position to approach the Persian Government with the facts that exist in Persian Baluchistan. 2. On the 1st August a slave woman came into the Concession at Jask and claimed protection from the Officer in charge of the Indo-European Telegraph Department on the ground of having been ill-treated by her owner. The owner arrived with ten armed men whom he left outside the village and demanded the return of the woman, who was handed over to the Persian autho rities in accordance with regulations. The Mudir bf the Customs, who is the chief Persian official, refused to hand over the woman. The owner of the slave left with a threat that he would capture any Jaskis he found outside the town and failing this would attack the town. On the evening of the 2hd the son of a Persian in British employ was, with his wife and some other Persians connected with British employees, carried off to the hills along with 80 goats. The persons concerned were not entitled to British protection. On news of this being received the Officer Commanding, Persian Troops, sent out twelve soldiers to obtain the release of the captives and himself followed later with another six men with no result, possibly owing to the fact that the Baluchis are too well armed. The latter stated that as soon as their slave woman was L released they also would re 1 ease their captives and the goats. Finally the Mudir sent back the woman, and the Baluchis equally released their captives and the goats they had captured. As nothing short of a campaign—and the Persian have for some years boggled against a campaign against the Baluchis-would have done much good and as Jask is°not in a position to start a campaign by itself, I am inclined to think that the Mudir at Jask did wisely, since where so many slaves exist one hardly affects the principle involved and his refusal might have resulted in loss of lives of people un connected with the incident. 3. In the middle of the same month the Superintendent, Telegraph Station, Jask, reported *to the Director, Persian Gulf Section, that three females with two children came into Jask from Gabreg and with the permission of the Persian Commandant there took shelter near the fort. The owners of the slaves on hearing the news sent in four armed men to the Commandant demanding the return of the slaves and threatening to use force if their demands were not complied with. Dur ing this time 25 armed men were said to be waiting at Ekdar and another ten at Looran to advance in the event of armed resistance being offered by the Military. The Commandant without opposition delivered up the slaves and the party left Jask without trouble. 4. This report was referred bj me to His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas, with instructions to discuss the affair with the Officer Commanding, Bandar Abba*, in whose command the Jask garrison is situated and to find out what he had to say in the matter. His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas, was at Karachi at the time and his Head Clerk could not get any definite information in the matter from the Officer Commanding who questioned his right to enquire into the subject and also his accuracy in stating that we had this right under Treaty. _ The Officer Command ing left Bandar Abbas in October Jast, but I am requesting Mr. Chick to discuss the matter with the General Officer Commanding at Shiraz so that officers should be aware of our rights on the subject. 5. According to a later report, the present Commandant at Jask refused to deliver pp a number of slaves who had similarly taken c bast ’ at the place about two +&lt;* • &lt; v2*4 ' months ago. But the two incidents above quoted show that the Persian Govern ment cannot, with its present strength, resist the Baluchis if the latter show determi nation. 6 . From other information received on my recent tour I have realised that slavery is very common, if nbt universal, in Persian Baluchistan, where the Persian writ does not run, but its action is local and it rarely affects the outside world, and its prevention must await a stronger Persia. Copies of this despatch are being forwarded to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz.29--,. 4 It will be remembered tbat in 1925 two of tbe Cousins of tbe Sultan of Muscat were kidnapped in the Sultan’s own territories and sold. They were in addition well beaten for having, with their negroid appearance, the impertinence to say that they were near relatives of the Sultan, who, however, for his comfort, recalled the fact that even Joseph was sold into slavery. That there is a small but regular stream of Baluchis from Persian Balu chistan for sale is obvious and that there are regular Baluch dealers who in addition to other business run a small but lucrative business in Baluch slaves is also certain. The name Abdullah Muhammad Dawwar occurs with regularity, and I have only been awaiting the freedom of the Navy from Kuwait affairs to ask the Senior Naval Officer to consult with the Political Agent at Muscat regarding making an arrest of this man, who it is stated has the protection of Saiyyid Hamad, the brother of the Sultan and Wall of Sohar. That slavery is common on the Trucial Coast is undeniable and I propose tightening up the reading of our treaties with the Sheikhs to the most favourable understanding possible in order to reduce it, but as is also the case in Ibn Saud’s country it will not be easy to put an end to the custom of house-born slaves. Under Muhammedan law moslems cannot be made slaves, and a “ Fatwa ” from Mecca on this subject would materially help. It will be noted that we have no treaty with Kuwait on the subject of the slave trade. In the accompanying memorandum Case No. 13 is interesting both on account of the magnitude of the dealing and the methods by which it was carried out. I accordingly quote it in detail. In this instance one Salahuddin was sent to India as a prisoner in connection, with a gun-running case and then went to Charbar with his son-in-law, Muhammad to earn a living. On their return to their home they found that twenty-one of their relatives had been sold into slavery by Mir Hoti Khan, one of the Persian Baluch chiefs who receives a subsidy from the Indo-European Telegraph Department for guarding the line between Jask and Charbar. In 1924 Salahuddin, his borther Ali Baksh and the former’s son-in-law, Muhammad, began to come to the various British Consulates and Agencies in the Persian Gulf attempting to trace their relatives. They found that twelve of these had been sold into Persian Baluchistan and for these there was no help from us. I am informing the Legation at Tehran of the whereabouts of these people. At the time the Persian writ did not run anywhere in Persian Baluchistan and I doubt if they can do anything now but on the coast they are beginning to move a little. Nine persons, however, were taken to the Batineh Coast of Oman by a Persian Baluch and thence were carried to Baraimi in the interior where they were beyond the power of Muscat and from that place distributed over the Trucial Coast. In cluded in these nine were the wife and three sons 'of Muhammad, who has spent the last five years attempting to trace them. I am glad to say that after five years we have in the last month been able to obtain the manumission of the party and to give the woman back to her husband, though in the interval one child has died and the woman was given to a slave of her owner by whom she had a child. In the course of the five years three others have been recovered and of the remainder two, who were once traced but were made to disappear, are still being searched for. The details of this case have been particularly useful since it has put us in direct touch with the methods used for the disposal of slaves and has enabled us to get the names of certain regular dealers in this traffic. I have kept the man Muhammad and his wife in Muscat as witnesses in the matter and I hope, with the aid of the Muscat Government and the Senior Naval Officer whose arrival at Bushire I am now awaiting, to make some .immediate arrests. As, however, I reported in my letter No. 5, dated the 12th January 1928, to the address of His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, this traffic in Persian Baluchistan will continue until the Persian Government are able to control that district. MC182FDI I str' Thus the general result of the enquiries I have made is satisfactory. Cases which occur of Indians being sold into slavery are very rare and with- very few exceptions they are recovered. Such cases of sale of Baluchis as occur outside of Persian Baluchistan are not numerous, actual traders are also very few in number and the work is only an addition to their normal work and not a definite trade, of these cases also of those reported most are recovered. With the money now at my disposal I will be able to 1 keep a sharper watch and I trust we shall be able to put an end to such limited trade of Baluchis as may still exist. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majety’s Minister, Tehran, and to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. Enclosure 1. Memorandum of cases of slavery in the Persian Gulf brought to notice from November 1926 to May 1928. (1) The Hindus at Debai in November 1926 found two Hinduboys in Debai, names Moti son of Garao of Lucknow, aged 17, and Shankar son of Shamrao of Poona, aged 13, kidnapped from Karachi. Moti was kidnapped by Muhammed Mekrani, an Indian garry-driver and sold through Abdullah Muhammed Dawwar in Debai, and Shankar was kidnapped by Darok son of Muhammed Mekrani and sold through Abdullah Muhammed Dawwar at Debai. Boys were handed over to the Besidency Agent, Shargah, and eventually sent by “ Lawrence ” to Bombay in January 1927 for despatch to Karachi. (2) A boy Nuru, original name Gangaram son of Hanuman Bania of Tatta, Sind, aged 13, whom the above two boys had seen as slave,, originally kidnapped by Rustam in Karachi and sold in Debai to Zaid and resold to Muhammed bin Rashid of Abu Dhabi. Nuru was sent to the Commissioner in Sind on 7th March 1927. (3) Musa bin Haider, aged 16, originally kidnapped from Karachi in April 1926 by Omar Coachman and resold through Muhammed bin Abdullah Dawwar (? Abdullah bin Muhammed) of Wadam at Debai. Information given by Superin tendent of Police, Karachi. Musa was recovered by the Residency Agent, Shar gah, and taken by the Hon’ble the Political Resident to Karachi in “ Chakdara P 7 and delivered to Superintendent of Police there. (4) The Hindus of Debai while searching for Hindu boys traced a Baluch boy,, whom also they first took to be a Hindu named Muhammed bin Davud of Kasar Khand, aged 14. Kidnapped by four armed Baluchis between Charbar and Kasar Khand and sold to a Baluchi called Muhammed resident of Baraimi, and resold at Abu Dhabi, about 1926. The boy was summoned to Bushire and repatriated to Charbar in November 1927. (5) The Residency Agent, Shargah, in October 1927 while searching for Musa bin Haider [vide (3) above,] traced a small boy of four years who had been imported from Baraimi and sold to a woman by Muhammed al Qufaidi, subject of Amir of Hasa, resident of Debai. The boy has been recovered and through the Hindus at Debai the Commissioner in Sind also came to know of this bov. A certain Haji Hassan Shirazi residing in Karachi thought that the boy might be his lost son and there is nothing definite to show that he has given up his claim. At the same time one Dhalumal Jashanmal of Tharushah (Sind) also considers the boy to be his lost son and has asked the Commissioner in Sind to arrange for the boy’s despatch to Karachi. A photograph of the boy is awaited from Shargah when it will be sent to the Commissioner for definite opinion. (6) In December 1927 the Residency Agent, Shargah, received a report about certain Baluchi slaves having been brought in a “ boom ” anchoring between Hamriyyeh and Umm-ul-Qaiwain and went there by motor boat but found nothing. In his absence his Fidawis found a youth, called Reza bin Rahmat Baluchi, aged 21, in the house of one of the Arabs of Shargah. The youth had been originally kidnapped by Khan Muhammed, Baluch of Mand and handed over to Rajab bin Mohamed Baluch of Yalan. Reza was repatriated to Muscat and the- kidnapped Rajab also sent to Political Agent, Muscat, with instructions to the latter to ask the Sultan to punish the man.(7) One Indian boy Mirza son of Gbulam Hussein recovered by tbe Kesidency Agent, Shargab, and repatriated to Bombay in October 1927. (8) In tbe beginning of December 1927 two Baluchis Sbambeh bin Sbahim of Karawan, aged 35, and another Khamis bin Ibrahim of Sadaich, aged 30, divers vvere going to Kalba to meet relations, at Khaburah and Sowaiq respectively. At village Bathnah they were captured by Bedouins and taken to camp in the interior of Ras-ul-Khaimeh. Headman Ali bin Saif al Khateri took Khamis and Shambeh was given to Bedouins. Village Bathnah is a dependency of the Shaikh of Fujai- lah. All bin Saif is the head of the Khawatar tribe living in the interior territory of Has ul-Khaimah. Shambeh fled and informed the Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimeh who informed the Residency Agent but was afraid to render any help himself for fear of annoying the Bedouins. The Residency Agent with the help of the Chiefs of Umm-ul-Quwain and Hemriyyeh was able to threaten Ali bin Saif and recover the Baluchi. Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah was warned, but he has written to say that he has no authority in the interior. (9) On the 14th January 1928 a Baluch reported to the Residency Agent, Shargah, that he had seen at Debai Baluch women and children brought to Abu Dhabi for sale. The Residency Agent recovered two women and two children, (Zahra daughter of Ahmed of Minab, aged 19, with a child, and Bibak daughter of Muhammed Rudbari, aged 27 and a child) from the house of Hilal of Nejd. The women had been kidnapped by Muhin bin Mubarak Baluchi, said to be well known in Mekran, and brought to Debai for sale. The women have been repatriated to Minab via Bandar Abbas, and Director, Persian Gulf Section, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Karachi, his been asked for details of Muhin bin Mubarak. (10) On 7th March 1928 a Baluchi woman Amnah daughter of Muhammed, aged 27, took bast with the Residency Agent at Debai. Sold by her former husband Muhammed to Abdullah bin Muhammed bin Muhammed Dawwar living at Thar- mad and finally sold to Muhammed bin Abdul Rahman al Qufaidi. As woman preferred to remain in Shargah and did not want to return to Mekran, she was given a Manumission Certificate. The Residency Agent has been asked to report result of his enquiries with regard to both the Abdullahs. (11) On 23rd April 1928 Residency Agent reported that two Baluchis from Muscat had been arrested while endeavouring to barter two begger Indians to Bedouins. Enquiries showed that the two persons belonged to Muscat and were not Persians. They originally were Jedghas of Kuchatl. Indians have been repatriated and the Residency Agent asked to send the two delinquents to Poli tical Agent, Muscat, who has been asked to request Muscat Government to have these two men punished suitably for their offence. (12) In April 1928 a certain Ghulam son of Qasim Ali Hijlasaz of Minab, aged 17, took refuge with the assistant of the Residency Agent at Dubai. The youth had been kidnapped by 12 Bashakirdis, under Abd Ali, and sold to Hassan Shah Baluchi of Kharawan. Finally brought to Debai for sale but he escaped. The Residency Agent has been asked to repatriate the youth and His Majesty’s Consul and Assistant to the Resident, Bandar Abbas has plso been asked to bring the fact to the notice of the local authorities with a view of their taking suitable action. (13) Twenty-one relations of Salahucldin bin Kamal Baluch of Task were kidnapped in 1924 and nine of them traced to Batinah. Five have so far been recovered, one died, Muhammed son of Jan Mohammed son-in-law of Salahuddin, whose wife and child have lately been recovered, is at present in Muscat. This case shows so fully the conditions of the trade and the methods used that I have made a separate report of it. Enclosure 2. • SUMMARY. Kidnapping of twenty-one relations of Salahuddin bin Kamal, a Baluchi of Jash. In January 1924 Salahuddin bin Kamal a Baluchi of Jask reported to the Political Agent, Muscat, that while he was at Charbar Sardar Mir Hoti’s men had taken away twenty-one relatives of his, women and children, destination not known.* ~&amp;r~ Mir Hoti is the Chief who resides at Jask and who is one of our subsidised chiefs on the Jask-Charbar line of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Political Agent, Muscat, thought they might have been taken to Batinah Coast and he took necessary action for investigation but Salahuddin later informed him that they were at Karwar in Persian Mekran. In June 1924 Salahuddin’s brother, Ali Baksh, informed the Political Agent that the twenty-one persons were at Sarmad with one Mohamed Dhawwar Baluch slave broker, the matter was taken up but Salahuddin and Ali Baksh disappeared. In September 1924 Salahuddin approached the Superintendent, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Jask, and he was advised to proceed to Muscat, he complied again accompanied by his brother Ali Baksh. They were not able to find their re latives in the Suwaiq district, but traced nine of them to Baraimi in the desert behind the Batinah Coast of Muscat. The Residency Agent, Shargah, was asked to endeavour and recover these people, but he replied that nothing could be done by him at Baraimi and that the Chief of Abu Dhabi had no influence with the Shaikhs of that place. In January 1925 Salahuddin reported to the Political Agent, Muscat, that he had traced his sister and three children to the house of one Dhiyab bin Sagar a near relative of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and he was therefore sent by the Political Agent to the Residency Agent, Shargah. The search was not successful and Salahuddin thought that his object had become known beforehand. 4n October 1925 Salahuddin came to Bushire and stated that he had traced seven of his relations (two in Debai, three in Abu Dhabi and two in Umm-ul- Qaiwain) and asked for a letter to the Residency Agent to help him. This was done and in July 1926 Muhammed son of Jan Mohammed, son-in-law of Salahuddin came to Bushire saying that he with Salahuddin had traced two of his own sons Ashraf and Hamal at Umm-ul-Qaiwain in the house of two men Muhamed bin Ahmed and Shaikh Salim respectively, and that when they took them to the Shaikh he released them and handed them back to their master instead of granting them their freedom and later another relation , Waluk (boy) was found and recovered at Debai, from the house of Thabit bin Turki. Again they found a girl in the house of Khamis bin Hamaidan in Debai but she was later hidden and could not be found. Being disappointed at no result following the Residency Agent’s action Mohamed came to Bushire. The Residency Agent was addressed and in reply he referred to one boy only the blame about whom he put on the Chief of Umm-ul-Qaiwain. In October 1926 Muhammed son of Jam Muhammed, gave full details of his relations kidnapped and gave the names of men engaged in slave traffic, bartering captives for arms as follows :— Mohamed Khan, son of Jelal Khan of Karawan ; Muhammed Dawwar of Karawan ; Ismail of Karawan ; Karimdad of Karawan ; Nawaz Khan son of Said Khan of Karawan ; Mirza Dur son of Mir Jan ; Yar Muhamed of Karawan. Muhamed Dawwar and Nawaz Khan said to be permanent residents of Swaiq on the Batinah Coast (under Muscat) and the rest residents of Persian Baluchistan occasionally visiting Muscat to buy clothes,@ f n- Tiie Pohti^l Agent Muscat, was addressed and also letters written to the W,h Th a1 ’ AW and and the Residenc; Agent bnargah. They were all given names of the slave dealers. ° ’ of Debafof Vember 1926 tbe Residenc y A g ent ^po^ed recovery through the Chief Lai Khatoun daughter of Kamal (sister of Salahuddin), and handed her over to the relatives. A 1927 ^ uiiame(i son of Jan Mohammed appeared before the Political A 0 ent, Bahrain, and gave name of a slave dealer in Abu Dhabi Dhiab bin Sagar and stated that he had recovered Ashraf one of his sons whom he had traced in 1926 but who had been forcibly taken awav from hm by orders of the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain. He said he had also traced ks Wife m Abu Dhabi with one child, the other one aged five havin' dTed ca me Bushire and gave details of his other two children (a daughter and a son) m Debai and Umm-ul-Qaiwain. The Residency Agent was addressed orn 'YT '' tha f, he could not trace ttiem so Muhammed son' of Jan Mohamed proceeded personally once more to Debai in September 1927.
