Stannus informs William Newnham that further enquiries have led him to conclude that reports of the incident were groundless. He states that he considers it necessary to reprimand Ruzza Ali [Riza Ali Khan], Native Agent at Sharga [Sharjah], for having reported an incident of such a serious nature without first ascertaining that it had some foundation of truth.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x00004b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
