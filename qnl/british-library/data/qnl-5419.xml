I have the honour to refer to the External Affairs Department Telegram No .476-A, dated the 12th September 1938, sanctioning the purchase of a second hand Chevrolet Lorry on condition that it should last for another two years* The lorry was duly purchased and is still in running order* Owing, however, to the abnormal conditions last spring it nad a very rough passage to and from Eabul, cost a consider able sum and will cost increasingly more in repairs as time goes on* It should with care last for another year but is not likely to be fit for service in the winter of 1940, before which time it should be replaced. The present price of a new Chevrolet Lorry in Meshed is approximately Rials.37,000A (or Rupees.5,200A at the official rate of exchange) for a Chassis only.

Financial, No. 1. To His Excellency the Most Honourable the Governor-General of India. My Lord Marquess, T have considered the Despatch of Your Excellency’s Government, No. ‘2 (Finance), dated 3rd November Proposed limitation of the financial 1938, regarding the nature and extent powers of the Governor-General in of the limitations to be imposed on Council during the transitional period the financial powers of the Governor- before Federation. General in Council while Part XIII F. 10191/38. the Government of India Act, 1935, is in operation. The proposals in that Despatch proceeded by reference to the terms of my Despatch No. 6, dated the 25th March 1937, to the Governor of Burma ; but I think that it may be convenient that the present reply thereto should be self-contained. 2. The limitations with which we are now concerned are such as might be imposed solely in the exercise of the Secretary of State’s powers under Section 314 of the Act, and nothing in the present Despatch must be taken as having any reference to any limitation imposed, or that may hereafter be imposed, by or under other provisions of the Act, such as Sections 235 and 247. It will, moreover, be understood that nothing in this Despatch affects the arrangements for submission to the Secretary of State of the Budget proposals, in regard to which the existing requirements will remain in force. Your Excellency will also appreciate that the directions now given must remain open to reconsideration in the light of experience. 3. I have decided, in accordance with the recommendations of Your Excellency’s Government, and in supersession of the directions communicated in my Financial Despatch No. 13, dated the 8th April 1937, that my previous consent shall be sought upon the following matters to the extent indicated against each :— (i) Expenditure in respect of the Governor-General’s staff and household, the residences, furniture and motor-cars provided for his use, his equip ment and travelling allowances, his sumptuary allowance and his contract allowance, shall be regulated by such requirements as have been or may be made in this regard by the Secretary of State. (ii) Expenditure in respect of Diplomatic and Consular Services in Iran and the Persian Gulf shall be subject to the previous sanction of the Secretary of State except in the following cases :— (a) fresh expenditure on salaries up to an amount not exceeding £100 per annum in the aggregate at any one Consulate; (b) increased expenditure on contingencies, except as regards an unusual item exceeding £100; (c) increased expenditure on travelling. The previous sanction of the Secretary of State shall also be sought to any addition to the total annual limit of expenditure fixed by him for office allowances and other contract grants for all Agencies and Consulates in Iran and the Persian Gulf where such expenditure is divisible between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom [18525]2 and the Government of India, except temporary excesses in the permissible aggregate limit not exceeding Rs. 250. (iii) Expenditure on the purchase of imported military stores shall be subject to such rules as have been or may be made in this regard by the Secretary of State, and no purchases not covered by such rules shall be made without his prior consent. (iv) The consent of the Secretary of State shall be obtained before any dispute arising out of the terms of a contract executed in England with a Railway Company of English domicile is referred to arbitration. 4. Apart from these specific limitations, the question whether a prior reference should be made to the Secretary of State will in future depend upon the judgment of Your Excellency’s Government. As Your Excellency is well aware, a similar discretion is already exercisable over the whole range of Government activity, except in so far as reference to me has been specifically required by the rules hitherto in force on the subject of prior sanction to expenditure, and the conventions governing its exercise are familiar. Tn broad terms, prior reference to the Secretary of State will be required either if the nature of the proposed action, or the circumstances in which it is to be taken, are such as to occasion doubt whether the Secretary of State may not find reason to question its suitability; or (even in cases where no such doubt is felt) if warranted by the intrinsic importance or general interest of the matter or by the degree of criticism which is likely to be aroused in Parliament, in the Indian Legislatures, or elsewhere. These criteria should in future be applied over the whole financial field. I do not propose to attempt to suggest in any detail how they should be applied, though I would particularly instance, as an example of the occasions upon which doubt might arise, the case of an important unresolved difference of opinion between the Finance Department and another Department. I prefer in general to rely on the discretion of Your Excellency’s Government, confident that it will always be exercised with a full sense of the ultimate responsibility to Parliament which the Secretary of State must continue to bear for all the operations of Your Excellency’s Government, I have the honour to be, My Lord Marquess, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) ZETLAND.A (16 ) / IS 2043 Copy of a letter No*206/I/14 &gt; dated the 14th February 1939^^^| from Hi a Britannic Majesty’s Consul General for Khora^r, ^ Meshed, Iran, to the Secretary to the Grovemment of I n dia in the External Affairs Department,New Delhi. I have the honour to refer to ray despatch No*78(1341/1/14), a copy of which was sent to you under Printed Letter N8.1342/ Xii L/14 of the 21st September 1937, on the subject of the land C'Cx't Uttfy fykS'M cJt?-z ^ Consulate General required by Ihe Meshed Shw Municipality for the realignment of an adjacent street and p, /V to enclose herewith a tracing of the area in question. 2. It will be seen from the plan that the new alignment of the street running from west to east will first cut off a small comer of the Consulate and then leave an unoccupied space between its northern limit and the present Consulate wall (marked A and B respectively). As it would greatly diminish the value of our property to allow shops or other buildings to be erected between it and the new street(on plot B) I refused to consider the cession of the area required (approximately 95 square metres) except in exchange for the area of the present lane which willbe unoccupied (approximately 215 square metres). This proposition has now been accepted. As indicated in my previous despatch the price offered for the land was 30 Rials (Rs. 5) per square metre only, but the true value is nearer 140 Rials (Rs. 23) a metre, so that the gain in value to the Consulate is not incondiderable. 3. The Consulate area to be surrendered contains besides the outer wall a small portion of the quarters of one of the clerks, comprising the kitchen, bathroom^, latrine and part of the woodshed. After protracted negotiations I have received an offer from the Municipality of 8000 Rials equivalent to Rs. 1340 as compensation for these buildings. This sum represents a fair price and will be sufficient to enable me to carry out suitable alterations to the quarter concerned. I shall in addition have to reconstruct the existing/existing wall in the area marked B in the plan but the ®ost of this work can be met from my current grant for repairs under 'office Allowance'* The old wall is in a very bad state and had it iiot been for the pending negotiations would in fact have been due for partial reconstruction two years ago. 4* Except for the inconvenience which the increased traffic is likely to cause us the exchange is not disadvantageous to Grovemment, and I have accordingly ttait the honour to recommend that it should be approved on the above terms. The Municipal authorities are most anxious to begin work on the new street as early as possible, and I should therefore be grateful if sanction could be communicated to me by telegeara, if possible, not later than the middle of April, so that the necessary alterations may be carried out during the summer months which are the most suitable for building operations. 5. On the occasion of a similar transaction in 1929(vide Foreign and Political Department Memorandum Ng.F.376-A/29 of 14th December 1929) sanction was accorded separately to the sale of a small area of land on our main frontage and to the erection of new buildings at an approximately equivalent cost. It may perhaps be considered desirable for accounts purposes to follow the same procedure in the present instance. 6.

Lord Halifax does not consider that there is any valid ground for declining to meet this charge* The principle of reciprocity could not be applied, since the cost of repairing the street outside a foreign consulate in this country would fall upon the municipal rates for which foreign consular officers are equally liable with other members of the community. Subject to the concurrence of Lord Zetland, Lord Halifax is therefore disposed to authorise the expenditure of the sum of 3,940 rials in this connexion* India Office*g 28 lio. X 07 7th April t 1936. AH My Lord, X havs the honour to transmit to you herewith a oopy of a despatch from His Majesty^ Joneol-General for Khoxasaan, regarding a demand v/hich he h i is received for the payment of the sum of dale 3,940 for the asphalting of the footpath in fron^of His MajeBty f 8 Jonsulate-Gene ral. #• ^hen this auestion was first raised in seal* official oorrespondenoe, His iiajesty^ Legation sug-ested for consideration that it mi f :ht be advisable, in the interest of good relations with the local authorities at Meshed, not to contest the charge on legal ground? , but to offer an ex~gratla payment of 50.,. of the total cost. Unfortunately the attitude of tho local authorities to Mis Majesty*? Jons u late-General is at present such that X agree with Mr. bquire that there is no likelihood that such an offer on our part would be accepted as a friendly gesture. This bein so it may be considered the best course that the question of payment should be decided solely on the legal issue. A® stated by Mr. Squire, the demand docs not appear pt* be based on any law making householders liable for the capital cost of asphalting of the pavements along the frontage of thair houses, fhe charge is based si iply on an administrative decision, nevertheless it seems certain that no Iranian subject could maintain in the courts that such a charge is illegal. Similar charges /were- a - (3 wexe nude in Tehran* jad hoo^ehcid^rb* had no option but to P ^ ox go to pxitfon. It appe ixo doubtful thexefoxo whethex Hits i^ajest^'s Joni*ul ite-Gem*x *1 would be juntified in xe- fusini-: payment of the ohixge on the gxound that it had no basis in Iranian law, *• fhe t uestion of payment may uoooxdin^ ly be xe- gaided as turning on whether under international law a foreign Uo?g rnraont must be uonsidexed liable to such a pay* ment lor the onpital oost of aaph^.lting the p-vement (which it does not own) in front of a Jonsulnr property. But certain other considerations are, I think, relevant, jttrst, I am aware that in .condon foreign missions are expected to contribute to the maintenance and ir.iprovemcnt of streets by way of payment to the relevant parish rates, Secondly, whereas I anticipate no i aprovement from an offer on our part to pay a part or even all of the cost, I think that a refusal on the part of the lonanlate-Geneial to contri bute, whether b .sed on international law or not, would be readily susceptible of misrepresentation in Tehran by the Meshed authorities. In normal ciioumatances, such a possibility must of course be faced, But other comma dca tions from Mr, i &lt;jttire show that the state of uffairs as regards British Jonsul.tea «.ni British-Iudian subjects in *ast Iran i» unfortun ttely such that tho posd bility of some remedicsf. action m y have to be considered. If the Jona elites are to become an issue I would prefer now to deprive the local authorities of any pos ible ground for misrepresenting them as unwilling to cooperate in im provements which the dhah has specially enjoined upon munioipallties, 5 * 1 8houl d l&gt;a e*a1i8f&lt;a If I might he famished /Inin dad oou*s« with &lt;in expression of year views on this matter, Should you oonaider that the oharge '.should be met or that an ex-gratia offer of 50, should be made, I trust that sanction for the necessary payment may be granted, I am sending copies of this despatch to the deoretary to the Government of India in the ^xterhal /.ffairs department, and to His jua^esty's jonsul-General for isLhora£c&gt;an at Meshed, X have the honour to be, With the highest respect.

In reply j pointed out that there seemed to have been a slight miscalculation of the area of our frontage which in fact is only 197 square meters. This figure has been accepted by the Municipality and the demand reduced to Hials 3,940. 2. I then enquired uncter what Law or Municipal emulations this demand was being nade and in .December last received a reply to the effect that fche charge of TUals 20 per square meter had been approved by the Municipal Committee as well as by the Ministry of the Interior. 3. I discussed the matter at £abul with :«tr. Butler and as there seemed no likelihood that payment by us would be accepted as a friendly gesture, decided to await further developments. I have now received a reminder asking for early payment for the asphalting which has already been completed and should be glad of instructions as to what reply I saoula give. It does not seem that the demand can legally be made and in the circumstances prevailing in Meshed at present I would suggest that payment should be declined.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Governor General of Khorasan has recently intimated to me in writing that a street-widening scheme is projected which would entail cutting off several yards of one side of the grounds of this Consulate-General. It would also probably involve the demolition and re building of some of the quarters occupied by the Staff. 2. The Governor General makes no mention of any sort of compensation, and merely suggests that a representative of the Consulate should meet an official of the Municipality so that /with the knowledge and concurrence of the Consulate General steps may be taken to the extension of the above noted street ’ 1 * The letter goes on to point out the improvement which would accrue to the Consulate property by the scheme. Needless to say the proposal is greatly against our interests, because firstly, we should lose a portion of our land; secondly, a good deal of expense will be involved in demolition and rebuilding; thirdly, the quarters when rebuilt will be very cramped; and fourthly, what is now a quiet side street may become a noisy thoroughfare and that brought within fifteen yards of dwelling houses in the Consulate enclosure. 3. The scheme also involves encroachment on the property of the Imperial Bank of Iran, which is situated opposite the Consulate. The Manager of the Bank has met the Municipal authority and discussed the proposal as far as he is concerned. Hw was not prepared to make any sort of verbal agreement and requested that the exact proposals of the Municipality be putin writing 0 This occurred some time ago and the Manager has so far received nothing in writing. He also explained that when a written statement was /N received he would need many months in order to communicate with his London Head Office before any agreement as to compensation etc., could be arrived at. 4. In view of the above I propose to await further developments from the Iranian side and similarly to ask for detailed proposals in writing and to warn the Governor General that delay is inevitable since the matter would require reference both to India and London before an equitable settlement could be effected. 5. The scheme is of no real importance to the town and I should not be surprised if, when they discover that compensation would be necessary it be dropped or indefinitely postponed. 6 . A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department under endorsement No. 146 of to-day^ date.

To - His Majesty's Consul General for Khorasan. Memorandum No.F.165-A/35. Dated Simla, the 8th August 1935. Proposed increase in the Khorasan and zahidan office allowance grants owing to fluctuation of exchange. Reference correspondence ending with your express letter No. 728 /a/IO dated the 18th June 1935. 2. In order to meet the position due to the fluctuation in the Rial exchange, the Government of India have had under consideration the following alternative proposals:- (a) Fixation of a portion of the office allowance grants in the local currency without reference to any fixed or fluctuating exchange rate, (b) Drawal of the office allowance grants at a fixed rate of Rials 600 to Rs. 100 - the office allowance in rupee terms remaining as at present, the difference on account of exchange being adjusted by the Accountant General, Central Revenues, under 'Loss by exchange' and (c) The continuance of the existing system of sanctioning increases in the office allowance grants in terms of rupees on account of fall in exchange, if and when there is an abnormal fall in the value of the rupee currency. 3. After careful consideration the Government of India have decided that the existing practice, i.e. the proposal at 2(c) above, should continue, particularly as it appears that the exchange position is improving. It is therefore requested that the exchange position for the current financial/financial year as a whole may be reviewed in December next and proposals for an increase in the office allowance grants, if considered necessary, may be forwarded to the Government of India in due course, 4. Prom your telegram No, 29 dated the 18th June 1935 to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, it seems that you have already overdrawn the office allowance grant for the first quarter of the current year. The Government of India are pleased to regularise this overdrawal, but this should not be construed as an authority for further overdrawals or for an increase in the grants fixed for the current year without sanction.

Beference your Express Letter NO.E.275-.A/34 of 25th October 1934. 2. Having just resumed charge at Meshed I have gone into the matter of the Special repairs referred to, in detail, and think it necessary I should apprise the Government of India of the true state of affairs. 3. Bor a period of some years during the acute financial depression, at the time when very large sums were relinquished under the Meshed budget by my predecessor, practically no xs^xxa repairs were carried out to the roofs of the buildings at Meshed. In fact only superficial repairs were done to stop actual leakage of water into the interior of the buildings. Having now had some years experience of the conditions in East Persia, I am convinced that savings under this heading were false economy and have le$,d to greatly increased expenditure in the long run. While obvious leaks in the roofs were stopped to avoid personal discomfort to the inhabitants* the whole superstructure became sodden, year after year, owing to neglect of replastering the outside(an annual necessity) with the result that the beams and wooden ceilings above are now completely rotten. 4. So bad was the state of the buildings that I was compelled on assuming charge at Meshed to undertake immediate repairs to the most dangerous portions. Owing to the financial stringency I was loth to apply for additional funus and during the past two years have carried out extensive repairs, which were really beyond the normal repairs for v/hich provision is made in the Office Allowance, and I had hoped, by studying the greatest economy and by spreading the remaining repairs over two or three years to complete them in the same manner without applying for extra funds, and I duly explained my plans to Major Gastrell and asked him to continue slowly repairing. UnfortunatelyUnfortunately my scheme of spreading the expenditure over a nuiuher of years was frustrated owing to the very abnormal weather in Khorasan this year - heavy rains continued for some months later than normal. It is possible also that the remain ing roofs were in a worse state than I had anticipated and that i it would, in any case, have been impossible to defer repairs any longer. In addition the Kran exchange this year has considerably decreased the money at our disposal so that it was t impossible for Major Gastrell to undertake more than the normal D repairs with the money at his disposal and it is certain that 4 the special repairs cannot now be long deferred. Nevertheless I am of the opinion that the sum of Rs.8,825/- asked for can be decreased to Bs.7&gt;250 if the Government of India be pleased to allot me Bs. 3000 /- immediately, in order that certain very urgent repairs can be carried out atpnce while the weather still permits. The balance of Rs.4250/- would then be required next year. If this be not done I regret that it will be really impossible to estimate the additional damage which may take place this winter and it may well be found that the sum of Rs.8825/- estimated by Major Gastrell may then prove insufficient, for he based his calculations on the present condition of the buildingsiwhereas considerable further deterioration will result unless certain works be taken in hand nee. Under the circumstances I beg to request that the Govern ment of India will be pleased to sanction by telegram a sum of Us.3000/- immediately, and to provide for Rs.4250/- for next year making a total of Rs.7250/- instead of Rs.8825/-,which I am satisfied will be sufficient if early steps be taken to stop further deterioration. The cost proposed should fall under 'C -6 Contingencies Central Contract Grant - Repairs** or if preferred might take the form of an increase in the Office Allowance Grant, since unlike the Gulf Residency, provision for repairs is, in the case of the Khorasan Agency, ir,eluded in the Office Allowance. The cost of these repairs will undoubtedly be far less than the original cost of the structures.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Foreign &amp; Political Department. A '70 4 o o EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL).

Estimates for Special Works to he done at Meshed. ^ ^ Sir, I have the honour to forward, herewith, an estimate for Rupees 8,825/- for Special Works to he done to the Meshed Consulate-General buildings. 2. The Consulate General proper and all other houses and quarters require re-roofing. Almost all of the buildings were erected over 25 years ago ana the wooden beams supporting the mud roofs have been either seriously damaged by white ants or have rotted. The roofs themselves are in dangerous condition and it is absolutely essential that they be remade without delay. 3. The Office Allowance Grant for the Meshed Consulate General has recently been reduced to such a low figure that it is not possible to undertake any special work of this nature and it is requested that / „ ■ &gt; the Government of India will be pleased to sanction the sum of Bs.8,825/-. 4. This sum is being included in the statement under Part II Section B (fresh items) in theBudget Estimates for the year 1935-36. (para 6 of my despatch Noil380A/62 of the 4th Octoher 1934J.

Please see P.Z.2903/32- H.M.Consul, Seistan, has received no reply from Mohamed All Bros- to his enquiry as to the sum which they would he prepared to offer for the land although a number of reminders have been sent. The prospect of receiving an offer of purchase from the firm, who have declared themselves bankrupt in Zabul, or from the Persiar authorities, or from any other purchasers is extremely remote. In these circumstances Major Daly puts forward the following suggestions in his memorandum of 9th March to the G-of I. (P.Z.2196/33) for disposing of the property:- (a) that the Tehran Legation should itself try to interest the Persian authorities, in the matter by suggesting that a reasonable offer to purchase the land and buildings would be accepted, (b) that a similar proposal should be made to the 171211 5000 3/33 Afghan Govt. (c) that some scheme should be suggested to the Persian Government for combining the disposal of the Seistan property with the sale or exchange of the present premises of the Meshed Consulate General and transfer of the Consulate General to a more convenient site outside the town. The G.of I. request that the necessary enquiries may be made by H.M. Minister at Tehran from the Persian Government and the Afghan Embassy in regard to alternatives (a) and (b). They are not enthusiastic about (c) but are prepared to agree to a scheme on these lines, if Mr.Hoare sees any advantage in it, and on the terms laid.down in their telegram of 11th October 1928, (P.5516/28),/2 J\ (P.5516/28), viz. on the understanding that no expenditure to Government will he involved ana that no money will change hands. It will he rememhered that th^ question of transferring the Consulate General at Meshed to a new site outside the town was considered in 1929, tnjit that very conflicting opinions were expressed on the subject hy successive holders of the post of Consulate General and that the scheme was finally abandoned at tha^ time (see Minute on P.5402/29). It may he the case, as Major Daly says, that the Consulate General is too laifge and expensive for present-day requirements, hut it seems undesirable that a proposal for getting rid of the present premises should he accepted without a thorough most examination of the arguments at the present time for ad against such a course. A hasty decision to dispose of the present buildings might well he regretted at a later date when larger accommodation might again he required at Meshed. In any case there is no particular virtue in combining the present-proposals with proposals in regard to the Meshed Consulate General and as the G.of I. say this would probably only complicate matters and further delay the disposal of the Consulate land at Zahul. Meanwhile the G.of I. desire to send Mohamed Ali Bros, three months’ notice to vacate their property (the firm has paid no rent since March 1931). A draft letter to the P.0, asking for their concurrence in this and deprecating proposals to dispose of the Meshed Consulate General without further consideration is submitted. G.E. CROMBIE. 2/6/33.

If the Minister sees advantage in either of them we can consider the matter further: but for the moment it seems better as suggested in the draft to concentrate on proposals (a) &amp; (b). J.G.

STf ( W. Sir, With reference to Memorandum from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan and Kain, No.118-20/6-A, dated 9th March 1933, (copy forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s letter No.48M, dated 30th March 1933), I am directed to request that, provided there is no objection. His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, may be asked kindly to make the necessary enquiries from the Persian Government and the Afghan Embassy, respectively, in regard to alternatives (a) and (b) in paragraph 3 of Major Daly’s Memorandum. 2. As regards alternative (c) the Government of India are of opinion that the introduction into the present case of the proposals for the sale or exchange of the Meshed Consulate General will probably only complicate matters and further delay the disposal of the Consulate land at Zabul. Should, however, His Majesty’s Minister see any advantage in combining the two cases in the manner suggested in Major Daly’s proposal (c)(2), the Government of India would have no objection to his doing so on the terms laid down in their telegram to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India No.2055 S, dated 11th October 1928. 3.

Beference your memorandum NoJ)373-N/33 of the 10th February, 1935. 1 . I regret that It Is has not been found possible to ascertain locally, what would legally be regarded as •reasonable* notice in a case of this kind, but inasmuch as the firm have entirely abandoned the premises for over a year, have no caretaker of any *ind on the premises, have failed to pay any rent since 1931, and have failed to reply to communications asking what price they are prepared to offer lor purchase of the land, I think that 3 months notice could not be considered other than •reasonablei If the Government of India are of opinion that, under the circumstances, formal notice is necessary, I would submit that such notice be given on their behalf by the authorities in Karachi, since no reply is obtainable from the firm and they might deny receipt of the notice if sent by post from here. 2. It is difficult to foresee the action which may be taken by the firm on receiving notice to vacate (although as pointed out above, they have in fact vacated the premises). The situation is complicated by the fact that the firm claim that the main building (a large house) is built only partly on land rented from the Consulate, and partly on land separately owned enclosure in py them. According to a plan on record in this office INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S ? No *4 8 an ^ was prepared at the time the land was first ’aieo 6 WAR. 1933 rented, their contention is without the slightest Rev; 18 \ D R 1933 ' foundation, moreover, the sale of land (none of whichis freehold in Sistan, except the Consulate plot) is, and never has been, recognised l&gt;y the Persians, so that they could not legally have acquired any land adjoining the Consulate plot. The firm has declared itself bankrupt in Zabul, and in order to clear a debt owing to the Persian Mili tary Department handed over their remaining assets in Sistan to the Military Department in lieu of payment. It may be noted that in so doing, no claim whatever was made to any portion of the land, in which their building stands. This claim was only invented when they considered the possibility of purchasing the Consulate land, which they no longer appear desirous of doing, as they will make no offer and reply to no communication on the subject. In view of the circumstances, I think it extremely unlikely that the firm would institute a suit in Persia, but they are thoroughly unscrupulous and the possibility cannot be lost sight of. 3. There does not at present, seem the slightest likelihood of a purchaser coming forward, and as previously explained to the Government of India, owing to the fact that there is no other freehold land in Sistan, it is virtually impossible to estimate Its value. Three alternatives occur to mei- (a) The local authorities wished to obtain sanction to make an offer for its purchase as an official residence for the Governor* but did not (*) succeed. Is it possible thaW if a proposal were put forth by the Legation, that a reasonable offer would be accepted, that the Central authorities would be interested/interested in the matter? (h) Is there any likelihood of a similar proposal to the Afghan Government being productive of results ? The Afghan Consulate is * rented building t and the site to be sold is the only freehold property in Sistan, and eminently suited for a Consulate. (c) Our Consulate General at l/eshad is in the heart of the town. It is too large (and expensive in •upkeep*) for present day requirements and I am convinced that the scheme, originally suggested by the late Colonel Biscoe, but abandoned by his successor, to transfer the Consulate outside the town and to have modern and convenient buildings merits serious consideration. The difficulty is that the present site is too valuable for any Individual to purchase, as a whole, except at a ’bargain• price, and in acquiring a new site, a fantastic price is always demanded for anything sold to ths ’British Government’. Would it be possible to suggest to the Persian Government some scheme whereby;- (1) The Sistan building and land be exchanged for an acceptable site on the outskirts of X?eshad, plus, if necessary, a cash payment, or (2) The Sistan building and land, and the Meshad Consulate General, be given in exchange for an acceptable site at Keshad plus a cash payment which would cover the cost of erection of the . necessary buildings. The Keshad site might be purchased by the Kunioipdlity and resold in plots at a profit. If, on the other hand, we ultimately decided to sell the Veshad Consulate General and acquire another site to erect buliainga, we should be/be compelled, unless we were to dispose of it at a price well below market value, to sell it in plots, over an indefinite period, because no individual buyer is likely to be forthcoming and a •Syndicate* would not purchase at anything like its true value, and a •bargain* such as that suggested above, would relieve us of the difficulties ( 1 ) of obtaining a site at reason able cost ( 2 ) of disposing of the present site ana buildings without a series of transactions possibly extending over two or three years. 4 . I am fully aware that proposals (l) ana ( 2 ) are not devoid of difficulty ana might not be acceptable to the Persians, (although 1 believe they would be attraotedSpy such proposals) but I regret 1 can see no other solution, in the event of A and B being unsuccessful, and we must face the prospect of the Sistan land and buildings being on our hands for an indefinite period. unfortunately missed our opportunity of disposing of this land during the war, when business in Sistan was flourishing and attractive offers were, I am informed, forthcoming. 5.

'\r Trie foreign Secretary to the Government of India ( foreign and Political Department, * Simla ' Appointment of Attache - Ifeshad. up ? ' ^ V I have the honour to state that the appointment of ITirza Saiyid I uhammad Khan Saj.jadi - a Persian subject -to the post of Attache to H.M. Consul-G-eneral Meshed appears to have been limited to a term of five years. This term expired on May 15th 19 52. On referring to the files in an endeavour to discover the terms on which he was appointed,! find that all papers in this connection are missing. From information which I have been able to gather I understand that the lat£ Colonel Biscoe,when Consul-G-eneral at Meshad experienced difficulty in obtaining the services of an Indian for this post &amp; as a special case, the appointment of a Persian was sanctioned. In view of the fact that ( Sajjadi was over-age at the time of appointment,was sanction ed the full pay of an Indian Attache, but the appointment was limited to five years, I am led to the conclusion that the advantageous terms of pay were granted in view of the intention of the Government of India to limit the period of employment and to thus .compensate the individual, T who would be ineligible for pension. 3. On account of the ruling rate of exchange the present pay of this Persian Attache amounts to a sum in Rials which eVi t closely approximates to the salary drawn by the Persian £ UJ o co 00 2. C C 2 o it ar ^ Ui p ho Govemor-G-eneral in Khorasan, and is very considerably in o v; excess of that drawn by the General Officer Commanding. Such 5 js P -p a salary is entirely disproportionate to the services 9 3 g 2 required under present conditions in Meshed, Sc in view of the standard of living of the Persians is mostunnecessarily high. 4. In addition to this high salary, &amp; the provision of free quarters in the Consulate, I see from the records, that the appointment carries leave under Indian regulations, which are far more generous than those enjoyed in any Persian Service ,&amp; the Accountant G-eneral Central Revenues, in direct correspondance with the Attache,has informed him that when proceeding on leave he would he entitled,as in the case of British &amp; Indian personnel,(who are on foreign service,which is not the case with a Persian) to travelling allowance either to Quetta, Basra, or Khanagiin according to the route selected hy him, should he choose to take leave out of Persia. In other words he is entitled to travel at Government expense,when proceeding on leave out of Persia, to the terminal points allowed to Government of India servants, who are on Foreign service. This amounts to the equivalent of an official in service in India being allowed travelling allowance to the port of embarkation on leave - a privilege which is not enjoyed in India &amp; seems unreason able to allow to a Foreigner. 5. As long as the present arrangement continues,whereby I am in charge of the Khorassan Agency in audition to Sistan &amp; Kain Consulate, the services of this Attache are not required. The Sistan Attache is fully capable of performing the duties. Moreover there is employed here a Persian Munshi-paid from the Office Contract Grant, .vho is equally capable,&amp; in many respects better qualified to carry out the duties. 6. Should this combination of duties (i.e. Meshed and Sistan 'be under one Supervising Officer) eventually liecoffie permanent the services of two Attaches will not he necessary. Should the Khorassan Agency he again separated from Sistan, I ar of the opinion that the employment of so expensive an official for Meshed, where the work is now extremely light, is entirely unwarranted. FromFrom the Political point of view Sajja&amp;i's continued employ ment seems highly undesirable. There is abundant ev^iaence that he is of more use to the Persians than to us. He was severely taken to task for serving in a British Consulate &amp; was allowed to continue in his employment only after he had paid a visit to Tehran and arrived at a ’Modus vivendi’ v/ith the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Colonel Barrett informed me that he was under no illusion in this respect - he had undoubtedly been permitted to retain the appointment on condition that he supplied information to the Persians. This condition renders him practically useless for our purposes. In cases where he is required to interview Persian Officials on behalf of British subjects, he is unable to achieve any satisfactory results &amp; appears to be positive ly obstructive. I have received a number of complaints from Indians resident in lieshad, &amp; from Pilgrims, to the effect that when he is sent by the Consul-G-eneral to assist them in difficulties which arise, he misrepresents their case &amp; makes no attempt to assist them. His position is virtually such,vis-a-vis the Persian Officials,that it is impossible for him to assist British subjects. In addition, the Secretary(Military Attache) informs me that he has very strong grounds for suspecting that he works with the Russians,&amp; this appears to be borne out by the fact that he has recently been detected receiving in his house a notorious Soviet ^v&amp;ent. Under the circumstances, both on the grounds ol economy &amp; of Political expedient, I strongly recommend that his appointment be terminated. If the Government of India be pleased to approve of this suggestion, I would request that the correspondance which took place at the time of his appointment he referrea to as explained above it is no longer availaole nere - ac I ue informed of the conditions under which his services could be uispensed with. Two alternatives seem possible - (1) That the term for which he was appointed, has expired, or (2) His services4- His services have to he dispensed with under the Betrench- nent scheme. Ihe Government of India will appreciate that either of these alternatives would, for Political reasons, he preferable to terminating his services on account of unsuitability for further employment. In either case I request that I may he informed as to the exact conditions of pay &amp; leave which should he applied. In the event of it being ultimately decided to continue the post of Attache, Meshed, a more suitable candidate - preferably an Indian, could be selected in due course, but as long as Khorasaan and Sistan be supervised by one Officer, there is no need to employ isle two Attaches. The Attache for Sist^SE-and Kain could take the vacated post &amp; the pay of Attache Sistan be saved. H.M. Minister Tehran has been consulted and sees no objection to the termination of Sajjadi's services 'on financial grounds”. I I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd. O.K.

I* have the honour to report for tne information of G-overnment that it was brought to my notice that a neighbour named Us tad 1 uhammad had male an encroachment on Consulate property. I visited the place at once and found that a door leading from a covered passage way into the compound of the house occupied by the Secretary’s clerk into a small winding alley way had been moved. By this action Us tad i.uhamrnad had encroached about 3 square yards into Consulate property. It is almost impossiole to determine the exact amount of encroachment as the title deeds of the land in this area, which was purchased along with other property many years ago, give no measurements but merely mention that such and such person’s house has been sold and has been bought by the British Consulate G-eneral. 2. At first Us tad Muhammad was disposed to dispute my contention that he had seized upon British G-overnment land, but later after I had called in Haji Muavin-us-Sanaya, through whom the purchase had been made, he admitted that he might have encroached on It square yxxx yards of Consulate land but contended that he had benefitted the Consulate by raising and repairing tne roof of tne passage and by giving the Consulate a better door. 3. The land upon which Us tad iuhammad has encroached is ^ ‘---c which the ceiling and the room built above it belong AJ ^ / ^ to a third party, its loss is therefore of no real Encroachment made on Consulate Property. value as it is merely a passage way of concernconcern to ttiis Jonsulate G-eneral. The passage leads into a little winding alley which finally debouches into a street leading to the Khiyaban-i-Pehlevi. J~ enquired :'rom two independent masons as to the value of tne land in this neighbourhood and was informed that it was 4 Tomans per zajr (slightly more than a yard) out that in this case as the building above the passage belonged to another party it would not be more than 2 lbmans a »ar* 4® I thought the best way to end the matter without further unpleasantness would be to sell the 3 yards of land to Ustad Muhammad for 4 Tomans a zar, i.e. double its estimated value, as he had seized upon it without permission. 5. I was led to this conclusion firstly because the actual title deed is so vague and secondly because l considered this a very unfortunate time to raise douotful boundary Questions. 6. is you know the Persian u-overnment is adopting modem methods of registration and along with all other land&amp;wners this Consulate General has been called upon to register its property. 7. In compliance with this demand l entered this Consulate General grounds for registration on 29th oeptembei 1930, but beyond acknowledging receipt of the application and accepting the preliminary deposit the Department of Land Registration has hitherto taken no steps. The Question of final registration and the settlement of any outsider’s claims to rights in the land will probably be taken up some time during the present Persian year. I have not produced my Title Deeds which are largely made out in the names of third parties and are all very vaguely worded, and I hope I have avoided the necessity of doing aoso by the general ci.eclara'oion that the boundaries are well known. 8. It would therefore have oeen untimely to s tart a dispute about a small portion of land of no value to G-overnment, and I hope that Government will approve of my closing the incident as quickly as I could and in the way I have done. I may mention that I have prevailed upon Us tad Muhammad to give me a written document admittii-g his encroachment and guaranteeing-* this Consulate (General the right of ingress and egress into the alley way through the land now sold to him. 9.

The floor of tnis room had been repaired and as it was damp and got little sun, it was necessary to keep a fire lighted during the day-time for two or tnree days in order to dry it. The room had been cleared of all furniture. On tne see that all was well and found it filled with smoke, it was evident that the beams in the ceiling had caught fire. As it was in the middle of the afternoon help was readily available and besides the Consulate staff twenty men came with most along the old and dry beams and rafters and for a time it was doubtful whet] er it could be checked. As it was, it took nearly two hours of hard work finally to put it out, and not before tne room in which it had broken out was gutted and the vemndan outside the bedroom as well as tne room beneath it, tne reception room, had been seriously damaged by water and debris. There can be no doubt whatever that if tne fire had broken out at night, vary the whole building would have been desbroyed;it is even doubtfu^ whether it would have been possible to save it if the fire had been discovered an hour later.

Lucxtily water was close at hand and it was possible to organise an effective chain of water bucnets. After some time it became apparent that the fire was spreading2 . xne fire was not due to carelessness on anyone»s part, | but to tiie fact tnat some ten years ago a fire-^L*ce had been Ituilt in tnis room where it never should have ceen built. The chimney had been run up through beams which in the course of years had got exceedingly dry. It is even possible that the process of smouldering had gone on for some time before tne fire eventually broke out. Whether tne fire was caused by a spark from the chimney or by the seif-ignition oi txxese smouldering beams, it is impossible to say. I nave been satisfied by the mason who built this Consulate that tnat is the only fire-place in tne house which exposes the building to a similar danger. The fire-place was put in without his knowled e and apparently without consultation with anyone who knew the original structure of the building. 3 . The cost of repairing the damage is estimated at about Ks. 1 , 2.00 made up as follows •- ll) Bedroom damaged by fire and verandah outside it; for provision of new cross beams, new floor, new wall and replacement of windows and door - - is. 750 (2) Reception room beneatn it anu verandah outsiue it. provision of new ceiling and fresxx painting of roof and walls. - - mi. 250 is) Head-builders commission. • xu&gt;. 100 U) Miscellaneous and unforeseen expenses. mi. i JQ Total. is. 1,200 This can be met from savings under my contract grant as reported in my letter Ko.887/i5/3, dated the 22 nd of October iy 29. 4 .

Wooden beams wmicix become very dry and very inf iamabie play a lar^e pai t in txxe construction of houses in Persia and frequently water isonly available in very sma^l quantities, sometimes at a great distance. It is unnecessary to add that there are no pumping arrangements or fire engines in lie shed. I am, however ^unaware of what the best type of fire-extinguishers is or how/tuey could be kept witnout tne ingredients deteriorating or indeed whether tney can ever be expected to take the place of water or should merely be regarded as ah additional saieguard.

Several of these were tried in Govt, buildings at Simla, and Minimax and F*re King were possibly the best. Ihe former is the most expensive, but probably the most satisfactory. On the otner nand, two years ago tne Indian Stores Depart ment, of the Government of India, recommended the use of Fire King largely because it was the cheapest and they were of opinion that there was little to choose between the various makes except in finish.

Ho.3465, dated the 3rd December 1928, in which sanction was accorded to the proposal to transfer the Consulate-General at Meshed from its present position inside the town to some suitable place outside it. 2. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorasan, has now reported that the transfer of the Consulate is not necessary as sufficient pre cautions have been taken to safeguard the health of the inhabi tants, and that moreover such transfer is not practicable, in view of the attendant legal difficulties, which were not fore seen when the original proposal was made. A copy of his report on the subject is enclosed for the information of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. 3 . In the circumstances set forth in the report, the Government of India have informed His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General that the questidp of the transfer of the Consulate may be dropped subject to the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government. I am to request that this may be confirmed.Copy of letter No.43-C., dated Meshed, the 21st June 1929, from His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Govern ment of India in Khorasan, to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern- merit of India* Simla* 5402 Subject:- Transfer of Meshed Oo^isulate outside the town. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram No.2961-S» dated the 22nd of December 1928, regarding the proposed new Consulate-General a 1-eshed. When that telegram was received it only remained ^or my Pre decessor to conclude the agreement with Mr. Mullick sanctioned by the Government of India in their memorandum No.F-102(7)-A/27, dated the 25th of July 1928, and to proceed with the undertaking. It so happened that Mr. Mullick was in India at the time the telegram was received and shortly after he returned to Tdeshed, Col. Biscoe received orders of transfer to Bushire. Col. Biscoe, no longer interested in the proposal, dropped it; and wnen I arrived here last April matters were exactly at the same stage as when the Government of India telegraphed their sanction in December 1928. 2. My first impressions of this place so definitely inclined me against the whole scheme that I decided to give myself some time to form a mature opinion of my own before committing Government irrevocably. After two months in lie shed my first impressions were confirmed. I found myself in disagreement with almost every one of Col. Biscoe f s arguments and conclusions; quite unconvinced as to the necessity for the change, and -- I say this with great respect for the Government of India must have given careful consideration to Col. Biscoe*s proposals extremely doubtful of the wisdom, from the point of view of^^ Government, of the agreement it was proposed to enter into^Afr. Mullick. I have now, for reasons which I will give m detail, come to the further conclusion that however desirable the unde taking mightmight be it cannot in any case be put into effect. 3 . A few days ago Mr. Mullick came to see me to discuss this question. Without giving him any idea of my own feelings I asked him whether he v&amp;s still prepared to enter into the proposed agreement. Under this agreement, as tae Govern..ient of India will recollect, Messrs. H. A. Mullick were to under- 't SilvS y '’(i) to buy a garden selected by the Consul-o-ene ral with an area not smaller than the present Consulate compound, »•( ii) to construct on it buildings similar to the existing Consulate buildings, the designs of which were to be approved by the Consul-General'* l£r. Kullick at once replied that he was not prepared to Sign such an agreement; that from the very beginning he had meant to make it clear that his liability must be limited to Ts.68,000, that is to say, Ts.8,000 for the garden and Ts. 60,000 for the buildings. I viets not really surprised at Hr, MuHich* s reluctance to sign an agreement in which his financial liability was not clearly defined. It was obvious that he would be committing himself to unknown obligations dependent on somebody else^ idea of what constituted * similar* buildings. On the other hand, I told him that I was certainly not prepared for my part to sign an agreement such as he wished without knowing exactly what I ms going to get for for the money. Mr. Mullick stated that/Ts.60,000 he hoj&gt;ed and believed he would be able to construct new Consulate buildings similar in every way to the present ones. At all events he would do the best he could. He may be right. Tomans 60,000 is a very large sum of money. But it is claar that with the best will in the world Mr.Mullick might mis calculate; and it is not impossible that after one or two buildings had been erected Mr.Mullick might find it necessary to economise at the expense of some others. The estimates giver by Col. Biscoe in paragraph 10 of his despatch No.24o of the 18th of April 1927 are admittedly rough and approximate only. O SxceptExcept for the item Contingencies Ts^SjOGO* no provision is made for walls round the compound and round each ol the houseSf the cutting down of trees, the clearing oi patns, levelling, construction of godowns, tennis courts, euC.,for an electric light installation or the purchase cf water,which would be a very heavy item* There is only one available garden which would serve the purpose, the garden referred to in Col. Biscoe’s memorandum No.823, dated the 10th November 1927. It was his intention to use part of this gar den for the Consulate while the Imperial Banx of Perilca. utilised the remaining portion for a new residence for their Bank Manager. The Imperial Bank of Persia have now ^.iven up all intention of leaving their present site and the conse quence is that if the Consulate-General moved into this garden considerably heavier initial expense would be necessary in clearing it, making paths and building walls than was originally contemplated by Col. Biscoe. Government would also be committed to additional recurring expenditure for both the annual rental and the cost of irrigation estimated by Col. Biscoe would be doubled. As a matter of fact it was ascertained subsequent to Col* Biscoe^ original despatch that the water available for this garden was altogether insufficient and that more water would have to be purchased out of the sum available for the buildings. With these considerations in my mind, I told Mr* Mullick that without furtter reference to Government I was not prepared to sign an agreement which would commit us both to a pure gamble unless I was in possession beforehand of further and more accurate information than I have at present. To have proper estimates and plans made by a qualified engineer would cost a considerable sum of money which would make another hole in the amount available for expenditure on buildings and wmch would be money entirely wasted if it should subsequently be found that suitable buildings could not be erected for the available money* And finally, in the course of my conversa- tion withwith Mr.Mullick it transpired that in view of certain alter ations to the roads outside this Consulate which are now oeing detract from the market value of these grounds, Mr.Ifulliek able -- objection to the proposal put forward by my predecessor lies in the fact that the transaction would appear to be of more than doubtful legality according to Persian law. In paragraph 5 of his despatch No.823 of the 18th November 192/ , Col. Biscoe states, correctly - ) that the present site of tnis Cons 1 ulate-General is owned outright by Government. He goes on to say 'we are free to dispose of it in any manner we please; and the method of disposal sanctioned by the Government of India was that after the new Consulate had been constructed, the existing site and the buildings) as they stand, should oe handed over to Mr. Mullick who would sell them as and when he found purchasers. It seems to have escaped Col. Biscoe’s notice that under Persian Law no foreigner is allowed to possess! any land except for his private residence or for the transac tion of his business. Some fiction might possibly be invented been known to everybody that Mr. Mullick had taken over this large compound and all these buildings not as private or business premises but as a speculative investment to sell at a proiit. In these circumstances it is almost certain that any sale the Persian authorities. .Ve are not free in fact to dispose of these buildings in the manner proposed. We could only get rid of them by transfer to a Persian subject which is a totally different proposition from the one put forward by Col. Biscoe and contemplated by Mr. Mullick. is more to be said. The chief reason advanced by Col. Biscoe carried out by the Meshed Municipality and wnich are lixely to might be compelled to reduce the amount he would be prepared to from lay out/Ts.68,000 to 67,000 or even 66,000. 4 . But the chief -- and, as it seems to me, an unanswer to get round the law as it stands but the plain fact would have -&gt; 1 fc.fr. Tfriil 1 i Mr Viorj Vp ri nvpr this effected by Mr. Mullick would have been declared invalid by This would seem to dispose of the matter. But there forfor the transfer of the Consulate, naaely, the unhealthiness of the present surroundings, is of so serious a nature that Government would he bound to demand from me some alternative suggestion, unless I were able to convince them that the change is not really necessary. I am most reluctant to put forward views of my own so diametrically opposed to those heH by Colonel Biscoe in a matter which he had much at heart; but the question is such a big one and affects so many people besides myself — and not in the present only but for all time -- that I consider it my plain duty to report my views to Government as faithfully as possible. Nor is it a question of one man’s opinion against another’s, but of Colonel Biscoe*s opinion against my own and that of every single person in Meshed — Persian as well as European -- with whom I have discussed the matter. According to my predecessor existence in this Consulate was* to use his own words, merely 'tolerable' because of the 'fairly spacious' gardens. My own view - - and I have travelled fairly extensively in India and Persia-is that the gardens of this Consulate challenge comparison v/ith any I have seen in Bengal, Rajputana, the Deccan, Baluchistan and even Kashmir view of in point oJ^ spaci ousne ss, beauty and cnarm. There is noticing to equal them in Persia so far as I know. The lawns are almost unique in this arid country; and the magnificient chinars, poplars, walnut and mulberry trees with their deep shade make this garden a green paradise after the glare and dust of the streets outside* a bit of England in a corner of Persia. Hot under 50 years could a garden like this be made in any other -place in Meshed. 6 . As regards its unhealthiness I am able to give Government the assurance of the doctor in charge of the American hospital that there is no danger to the health of the inhabitants of this compound provided they take the reasonable precautions that we must all take in the east. In the letter which accompanied Colonel Biscoe*s original despatchdespatch ho. 243 of the 18th of April 1927, Major Stocker,the then Agency Surgeon, writes that every new arrival in Meshed suffers from diarrhoea. I have been in Meshed for over two months and I am glad to be able to say that I have never enjoyed better health. The same I think can be said of Mr. and Mrs. Hart who arrived here three months ago and Mi’. 0 *Dv»yer, the Vice-Consul, who came here eight months ago. I cannot help thinking that Colonel Biscoe gave Government a rather unduly alarming impression of the state of affairs. in his first despatch he refers to his European nurse being ill with typhoid. I believe it is not altogether certain that this typhoid was contracted in Meshed. Again in his telegram Ho.77-C of the 5th of October 1928, in which he urges a speedy settlement of the case, he referred to another serious case of typhoid occur ring among the Indian staff of the Consulate. It subsequently transpired that this clerk had not got typhoid at all. In any case, whatever risks to health there may have been in the past seem to have been satisfactorily removed by the adoption recent-, ly of distilled water for drinking purposes. Since then the general health of the inmates of the Consulate has been excellent Major Stocker also referred to the abundance of flies, sand flies and mosquitoes, to dust from the main roads and to the stagnation of air inside the Consulate. Such little annoyances are inpe,parable from life in the east. But in point of fact every building in this Consulate is fly-proof. Sand-flies and mosquitoes are to be found in gardens outside the Consulate just as much as inside. And as regards dust and the discomfort (if it is discomfort) of living within the town, the Consulate compound is so spacious that it is at times difficult to realise that we are not miles away from Meshed. Hot one of the other officers who live in the Consulate has any wish to leave it. On the contrary every one else who has heard of the proposal considers that it would be a tragic and a deplorable mistake. We should be leaving a beautiful garden most conveniently situatedsituated for the despatch of business in the best position in the town for a bare and shadeless plot of ground separated from the town by two miles of dusty road in summer and in winter completely cut off by snow and mud. 1 'rom the point of view of Government we should be leaving a valuable property of our own to become the tenants at will on far less valuable ground of the Meshed Shrine. The only objection which can be urged to the existing Consulate is that the main building though a delightful one is an old one and will possibly require considera ble repairs at no very distant date. This is a necessity which will have to be faced when the time comes. but I do not think it can be seriously argued that that possibility justifies the sacrifice of all the other buildings as well as of the garden. 8 . There is one other fact which I have to bring to the notice of Government. Some days ago the Mutawalli Bashi, who manages the Shrine properties on behalf of His Imperial kajesty the Shah, informed me, to my surprise, that so long ago as last October he had actually purchased for the agreed price of Ts.8,000 the trees and buildings in the garden belonging to the Shrine which Colonel Biscoe had in mind for the new Consulate; and the purchase of which naturally depended on the agreement with Mr. Mullick being signed. He added that the Shrine had already paid part of this sum to the late lessee of the garden and that he was only waiting for Mr. Mullick to reimburse him the Ts. 8,000 when he would hand over the garden to us . I gathered from the Mutawalli Bashi that he did this to help Colonel Biscoe who was anxious that the whole affair shoula be concluded as quickly as possible at a time when neither he nor Colonel Biscoe had any doubt but that final sanction to the scheme would be received any day, and that Coloner Biscoe himself would be here to put the matter through himself. It was extremely embarrassing for me to hear all this when I had just told the Muuawalii Bashi that for various reasons I thought it likely that the agreement with mi*. Mullij^ck would never be signed andand that the whole arrangement might fall through. And i did not make my position any easier to he told that the Mutav/alli Bashi had done this out of friendship for us without the permission of the Shah. The Mutawalli Bashi had of course no authority from Colonel Biscoe to make this purchase. The transaction, as he very well knew, was to oe carried out oy Mr. Mullick as part of his agreement with the Consul General if and when that agreement were signed. The responsibility is entirely his and it will he his business to get out of the entanglement if the proposal to buy the garden finally fa^ls through. So far as 1 can judge he fully realises this and ne does not appear to be much put out. I have told him frankly what the present position is, namely that Mr. Mullick is not willing to sign the agreement and that I have'been compelled to reopen the whole matter and refer it to the Government of India for orders. It is an awkward complication; but I do not think it should be allowed to affect the decision in any way, the issues involved being far too important. 9 . The conclusions of this despatch, for the length ol which I must apologise, may be summed up very briefly as follows:— I consider the scheme in its present form to be - (a) Impracticable : because (i) Mr. Mullick will not sign the agreement sanctioned by the Government of India; and (ii) the proposed method of disposing of the existing Consulate seems to be contrary to Persian Law. (b) Inadvisa ble s because (i) We should be giving up a valuable and unique property of our own conveniently situated in exchange for less valuable property we can^not ever acquire at an inconvenient distance from the town; and (ii) Government would be involved in consideiable additional recurring expenditure. (c)ass (c) Unnecessa ry: because there is no risk to the health of the inmates of the present Consulate provided ordinary precautions are taken especially as regards drinking water• For the above reasons I have ventured to reopen the whole question, fully realising my responsibility in doing so after Government has already given its approval; and with great respect beg that Government will permit me, in the circumstances, to take no further steps in the matter. 10 .

They show that if a lease for 99 years is obtained from the Shrine, at the end of that period either the lease will be extended or the Shrine appeared before. !ome figures are also given which however do not make the financial position absolutely clear. The present buildings are estimated at a value of 25,000 tomans, and the site at about 63,000 tomans, total T.88,000. The cost of the buildings to be erected will be 68,000 tomans approximately - but whether this includes the site also is not clear, owing to the confusing use of the word 'garden'*. It is therefore difficult to say definitely whether the contractor’s estimated profit is 20,000 tomans, i.e., about 30%, or considerably less.

Sir, When handing over charge to me at Duzdap my predecessor Lieut-Colonel Haworth discussed with me a project which he had had in his mind for some time, namely the transfer of the Consulate General from i os present position inside the town of .Xshed to some other place outside the town. I have now “been here for about 4 months, and have come to the conclusion that for the reasons which I shall proceed to state a move of this nature is essential if the Consul General and his staff are to maintain their health, and therefore have the honour to address the Government ox India on the subject. 2. Colonel Haworth informed me that during the whole time that he had been in Meshed both he and his wife had been extremely seedy, and expressed a hope that I and i^y family would be aole to stand the climate of this place. I have hitherto enjoyed excellent health, but during the 4 months that I have been in ileshed I have been constantly unwell, while my European nurse is at the present moment in hospital with typhoid; I do not however attribute this to t ;e unhealthiness of the Mesired climate: Persians complain very much of the climate which is more variable than that of other places in Persia but this should not affect European *I do hov/ever Europeans who come from a variable climate. I do hov/ever attribute it to the present position of the Consulate and the extraordinarily unhealthy surroundings among which the Consul General and his staff are compelled to reside. 3. The present site of the Consul ,te General was acquired in the year 1892 and the buildin ;s completed in June 1893, vide letter Ho. 146-A., dated 3rd June 1893 from the Consul General and Agent to the Governor General, as he was then s'-yled, to the Government of India in the xxxxxzx Foreign hep irtment. As will be seen from the plan forwarded with that letter at that time the Consulate though within the city walls was surrounded by gardens. The city of Meshed has however grown rapidly in recent years and is still expanding. It now has a popul ation of ab o t 30,000 inhabitants increased during the summer by a large influx of pilgrims from Jentral Asia, Afghanistan, India etc. Tne Consulate General is no longer on tne outskirts of the town or surrounded by gardens, but on the contrary is a considerable distance inside the town and is surrounded on all sides by buildings. On the west is a main road on the opposite side of which was formerly the Wazir of the Shrine’s garden: there are now a number of snops there and a large two xx storied hotel is in course of construction for the wealthier type of pilgrim, from which they will look straight into the Consulate. On the north and east where also there were formerly the Liu j tahid * s garden, Ha j i * s garden, etc., there are now Persian houses, while the Arsenal compound on the south lias been turned into Persian Artillery Barracks. Tne back wall of these barraens is only 38 yards from tne front of the Consulate and some 150 horses and some 200 men are lodged in them! there are no proper arrangements for the disposal of litter or for the sanitation of the men, and th manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persis whose house is quite close to the Consulate informs me On at the stench towards the end of the summer both in his house and inin the Consulate is frequently intolerable. I may add that the Consulate possesses not a single wire door :aui or window* It will therefore I tnink be admitted that the Consul General is compelled to live under conditions that would not be tolerated for a moment in any cantonment or civil station in India. 4 e Another great difficulty is the v/ater-supply. General ifeclean the tnen Consul General writing in Jay 1389 to Sir M. Durand observed* H the sanitary conditions of Jeshed are shoc.ing. The place is full of grave yards, the ground is saturated with filtn, everything nasty is thrown out into the roads, and the water is everywhere polluted, and it is only by sending for it to a long distance that we can secure a pure supply. All this would be obviated by our having a house outside the walls’*. Although the streets are possibly somewhat cleaner now than they were tnen, the otner conditions remain the sane, and the sanitary arrangements merely consist of cess pits about 30 feet deep. General Ifo.clean made attempts for two years to obtain a site for the new Consulate General outside the town, but owing to continued obstruction gave it up, and he had practically decided to improve the then existing buildings when by chance the present site fell vacant and ne managed to buy it. How however owing to the growth of the town the conditions must approximate to those which compelled him to leave the original Consulate. Jy predecessor used to have a cart in which water was brought supposedly from a Karez outside the towns it is however impossible to guarantee that a cart driver will fetch water from the place from which he is supposed to bring it and as a matter of fact the man was found to be bringing it from one of the drains which run round the city. Colonel Hawarth then had a well dug within the Consulate Compounds the water of this well has however been analysed by the Agency Surgeon and has been found to be contaminated and unfit for human consumption, and it is obvious that this must be the case &lt; sincen '-V since as stated above the sanitation of the town consists 01 deep pits tnrougn whici tne well water must percolate. It can of course be rendered sterile by chlorinating and boiling and the Agency Surgeon io 6 t chlorinate hie well but tne water is muddly and very unpleasant to drink, ke h .ve most of us drunk much chlorinated water daring the war, but one hardly expects to have to do so in times of peace. Personally I have installed a still, and dr ini: nothing but distilled water. 5. *.7ith the exception of the Jonsul General and his staff and the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia all the other Europeans in neshed reside either outside or on the outskirts of the town. The Russian Consulate General was formerly within the walls but is now about half a mile outside the town: the Accountant of the Bank, the llanager of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturing Company and the American Financial Adviser have houses outside the city walls, while the Director of Customs resides on the outskirts of the town. The American Mission is also on the edge of the town against the city wall. The Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia informs me that if the Consulate were moved he would like to move his house too, as he finds the present situation most unhealthy. in short the British Consulate General is now situated in tne interior of a large oriental city, entirely devoid of any sanitation and with no arrange ments even for a suitable water supply. Major Stocker reported most adversely on the situation of the Consulate shortly after his arrival here* Colonel Baworth was however much occupied during the summer with disturbances first in Kuchan and then on the Sarhad, the 8 nah f s visit etc., and tnen knowing that he would be leaving shortly he j decided to leave tne matter for his successor to deal with. As I have said he discussed the matter with me at Duzdap, and Major Stocker also mentioned it to me soon after my arri'val; and I append a copy of a letter dated 12 th March 1927 which heis he has addressed to mes I did not hov/ever wish to approach the Government of India in the matter until I had had some personal experience of the place and had considered what otrier arrangements it was possible to make- It does not however take long to realise the drawbacks to the present position and in view of the fact that a member of my household is at the present moment ill with typhoid, that I myself have not been well, and that summer, when the sanitary conditions become most trying, is approaching I feel that I can delay no longer. 6 » I append herewith a statement showing the cost of the original land and buildings acquired in 1893, together with the cost of the additions that have been made from time to time. It will be seen that the land and the buildings have cost Government up to the present hs. 1,34,480/15/10 or if put into Persian currency at Krans 375 = Rs. 100, Tomans 50,430. The total area of the land is now 3148D square zars (l zar - 41 inches). Owing to the expansion of the city the land has increased considerably in value? I have made careful enquiries from merchants and others who have property in the town, and am informed that the present site of the Consulate is worth about Tomans 2 a square zar. A narrow frontage on the main street would probably fetch as much as Tomans 5, but the back portion would probably not fetch more than Toman 1 while it would be necessary to allow for lanes to permit of access to the houses, when it was built over. Tomans 2 therefore is I tnink a reasonable average. On the other hand the buildings would nol^Letch much. Firstly they are unsuitable for occupation by Persians or for xaxxxxxxxxxx conversion into offices or shops, and secondly they are in a bad state of repair. All the better class buildings in lie shed are built of sun-dried bricks faced with burnt bricks, and this system has been followed in the case of the Agency Surgeon’s househouse, the Military Attache’s house, the office, and in some of the lower portion of the Consulate. The upper story of the Consulate however is built entirely of sun-dried bricks, and even these h ve not been laid flat out have been set up on edge and supported by wooden uprights* One o.l ohe uprights which was adjacent to a chimney recently was found to be smouldering, and I had to have a portion o- the v; all pulled down, and found that it was built of two rows of 'Kacha * bricks set on edge with a space in between which xiad not been filled up at all. The roof is of mud and leaks in many places, the wooden beams on which the j_1qoi o^. one upper storey is supported have sagged and string stretched from one end of the chief bed room to the ot ler is 2 ' above the floor in the centre of the room. I fancy it will be found that the beams have been eaten by white ants, as was found to be the case in the Bank House close by. The hospital which was also built of sun-dried bricks was on the verge of falling downt a special grant has recently been sanctioned by the Government of India to repair it, and the the present Consulate building is to be retained, it will I xxx think be necessary in the near future to carry out extensive repairs. prepared by a competent individual of the present sale value of the buildings, but I do not think they would fetch more than about Tomans 25,000, and this only owing to the rise property therefore may be taken at about Tomans 87,000. than land inside the town, and, if I have succeeded in convincing the Government of India of the necessity for a transfer and they are prepared to accord their sanction to it, I do not think that the move ought to involve any expenditure, for with the sale proceeds of the present site and buildings it will be possible to acquire a less valuable work is being taken in hand as it was urgently necessary. If I have not yet had any detailed estimates of prices since they were built. The total value of the 7 Land outside the town is naturally much cheapervaluable site and to construct on it tbe necessary buildings with xx the balance. The present buildin -s cannot however be vacated until the new buildings are ready for occupation, and therefore in the ordinary course it would be necessary for Government to acquire a fresh site and construct a new consu late and then subsequently to recoup themselves by the sale of the old buildings and site. 3 . It is very doubtful however if any one could be found to buy the whole place as it stands lock, stock and barrel, as the sum involved is large, 'breover the site is only worth the figure I have put on it if sold in small plots for building purposes, and if sold to a single individual would probably not realise so much. It is not feasible however for the Consul General to sell the land piece-meals it would probably be a year or more before the sale was completed, every Persian pays by instalments, and difficulty might be experienced in collecting sums due etc., and it would involve an infinity of trouble and probably references to the Karguzari. 9, I am however in a position to put forward an alternative proposal for the consideration of Government, v/hich I trust will meet with their approval. I have discussed the matter with a partner in the firm of IT.A.Malik of Lahore who has been here fxrx for some time past in connection with his business. The firm has the contract for the supply of rations and materials on the ITushki extension railway* they also have contracts at dukkur, property at Karachi, and at Lahore, and landed property in the Punjab. Mr • Malik was himself for some time a student at the Mayo Art Scnool, Lahore, and did some decorations and otner work for Lord Kitchener at Snowdown, has travelled extensively in Lurope and is much interested in the designing of houses of which he has constructed a number in Lahore* There are several gardens in the vicinity of the town, any one of which would be suitable as a site for the newtfc*. j, &gt; new Consulvte, and he has expressed his willingness to buy one of them and to build in it a Consulate, houses for the *igency Surgeon, the Military Attache 1 , and the Vice Consul and offices, hospital, clerks* quarters etc., in fact exactly the same buildings as exist at present here (except sowars* lines, which will probably not be required, vide my letter iTo# 5.C. , dated 26th January 1927) if Government will in return hand him over the present site and buildings, as soon as the new ones are ready for occupation. 10 . I give the follow/ing approximate estimate of the cost of the new buildings. The figures are based on the cost of some admirable bungalows recently built here by the American Mission, which as a matter of fact are very much better built than any of the present Consulate buildings. Consulate Tomans, 20,000 Agency Surgeon, u 6,500 Military Attache* « 6,500 Hospital, tt 5,000 Office and Vice Consul®, n 10,000 Attache* and two clerics, it 5,000 Servants* quarters and ) chuprassies lines ) it 2,000 Contingencies, it 5,000 Co st of garden. it 3,000 it 68,000 As Mr. Malik states it is a a somewhat speculative venture: he will have to lay out money in the first instance, and will not begin to recover it till tne end of the first year, and it will probably be at least another year before he has succeeded in disposing of the existing site, and getting his money for it. The Persian is not a good payer. In these circumstances the anticipated profit cannot be regarded as excessive• 11. One or two of these gardens belong to private individuals, but most of them belong to the Shrine. The property of the Shrine cannot be permanently alienated and isis ordinarily given on lease for 30 years but in special cases, with the permission of His Imperial majesty the Shah, wno is the titular Manager of the Shrine, for 99 years and if a garden belonging to the Shrine ms selected it would be necessary to pay ohe lessee for tne price of the garden, value of orees, walls, buildings if any etc* and tnen to pay ground rent to the S^irine* i'he ground rent is usually 1 Shahi per zar per annum, or on a garden of say 30,000 zars would amount to fomans 150 per annum, approximately hs. 425. Government however at present pay Hs. 1200 per annum for water charges for the present garlen, so the ground rent could be met out of this, leaving Hs. 575 for water for the new garden which v/ould prooably be sufficient as water is mucin cheaper outside one town tnan in. I do not think there v/ould be ai y difficulty in obtaining a 99 years lease in the present case and it is long enough for all practical purposes. Aforeover t jo rule is that at the expiry of a lease the Shrine must either renew it or pay for all buildings or other improve ments that have been erected on the land by the lessee at a value to be fixed by arbitration. 1 may mention that though the material of which me present consulate is bulls is extremely bad, the design of the building is, in my opinion, very good for a place wimi a climate like that of lie shed t and subject to a few minor modifications and improved sanitary arrangements, the same general design would be adopted, and it would not be necessary to get out fresh plans etc. The new building however would be faced, externally and internally with burnt cricks, with a layer of ’'Kacha” bricks in between. This system is universally adopted here, the loecal masons understand it, and is satisfactory; at any rate xx it is a great improve ment on the existing building. 13. The Agency burgeon 1 s and Military Attache's houses are both aliices though built of better materials tnan ohe consulate, the design might with advantage be changed in some respects, since these houses are exceedingly coldcold in winter. The accomodation would however be similar to th t in the existing houses. 14. If therefore this proposal is accepted the Jonsul General and his staff will be accommodated in buildings that are practically the same as those that they occupy at present but the Consulate instead of being in the middle- of squalid, dirty, and unhealthy surroundings will be right outside the town, in a large garden and with no other buildings near it. 1 /breover in selecting a site I would be careful to choose one on a side where the town is not likely to expand so that as far as can be foreseen there would be no likelihood of a similar situation recurring 30 or 40 years hence; wnile outside the town a good supply of drinking water would be easily obt inable. I know hr. llalik personally; I believe the firm to be a reliable one, and they have contracts and property in India. He is anxious to extend and develop his interests in He shed, and would I am sure do his best to satisfy the local British Authorities; and finally the present site and buildii gs would not be handed over to him until he had built the new ones, and they had been approved. There is therefore no risk to Government involved. 15. To sum up, my proposals are tint an agreement should be entered into with Messrs. IT.A.Halik under which they would undertake (i) to buy a garden selected by the Consul General with an area not smaller than the present Consulate compound (ii) to construct on it buildings similar to the existing Consulate buildings, the designs to be approved by 'che Consul General. When these buildings had been constructed and approved by the Consul General, Government would undertake to hand over to Messrs. Malik the existing Consulate site and buildings as they stand. ITo expenditure would be involved, and no moneywould change hand I have, etc., Sd. H.V.Biscoe Lt-Coionel Hia Britannic Ujecty's Consul General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan. Copy of a letter from Major C.J.Stocker, 11.C*, I.M.S. , Af^ency Surgeon, Meshed, to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General and Agent of the Government of India in Mhorasan, Meshed, dated the 12th March 1927. I have the honour to refer to my letter of 12th July 1926 addressed to Colonel Haworth and to call your attention to the conditions of housing of the British community in Meshed. The situation of the Consulate General was originally such that its sanitation could be treated as a unit separate from the town, and could be efficiently dealt with but in recent years the growth of the town has been such that this is no longer possible and we are obliged to snare the general The effects of this lack of sanitation have been felt by every member of the co.miunity. A form of diarrhoea resembl ing hill diarrhoea is experienced by every new arrival in Meshed both European and Oriental. Dysentery and typhoid have occurred during the last year, malaria, epidemic sore tnroat and furunculosis have been common. Elies, sand flies and mosquitoes abound, whilst the dust from the main roads and the stagnation of air in the Consulate grounds, surrounded as they are by trees and buildings, aid to the general discomfort and unhealthiness in the hot weather. I have myself carried out several water analyses and bacteriological examinations of the Consulate supplies, lack of sanitation with the rest of tne inhabitants. andand submitted a copy of one to the deputy Director of (^ hedical Services and I am satisfied that the present supply, which is the only one available, as long as the Consulate remains on its present site, is dangerous and needs constant supervision. Refuse disposal is very difficult, as incinerators could not be used in the town, and although we have a system our neighbours have none. Rubbish is s rot into the street at our gates, whilst the artillery lines dry stable XitXie litter on a roof not 50 yards from the Consulate front door. / I am is of opinion that much of the illness and discomfort from Y/hich the British community suffer could be avoided were the Consulate moved outside the town. This is the step which I recommended to Colonel Haworth last July and would again recommend to yourself.7 2 *&gt; - tu t I o , . 1 * 3 tJ Statement showing original cost of land and buildings comprising Consulate General at Meshed. 1893. 1399. 7 1905. 1906.

Reference your telegram No. 102(7)-iv. , dated the 29th June 1927. I have delayed replying sooner to your telegram for several reasons. Firstly one of the greatest drawbacks to the present site of the Consulate was the nearness of the Persian artillery lines: in this respect matters have improved as the Persian military authorities have moved the artillery outside the town, and have converted the quarters occupied by them into transport lines, occupied partly by mechanical transport and partly by horse transport. The number of horses is however small and the offensive smell that used formerly to come from these buildings has now in large measure ceased. 2. Secondly it seemed improbable that it would be possible to begin building etc. before the spring of 1928, and a I thought it would be preferable to spend a summer here and see whether a site outside tne town really v/as appreciably cooler and healthier than tne present site and then to discuss the matter personally with Sir Robert Clive. 3. I have now been here throughout the summer and despite the fact that some slight amelioration has been effected by the transfer of the artillery lines I have no hesitation in saying that my longer experience has but confirmed the opinion I formed soon after my arrival: and for the reasons given in ny letter No. 243 dated the 18th April 1927 I think that it would be most desirable to move the Consulate outside zk. the town. The general health of the community here has not been good: the dust in summer, to w.iich I largely attribute it,it, inside the town is appalling* Directly one goes outside tne town one in great measure escapes from tnis, and tne air is incomparably fresner and healthier. Satisfactory arrangements for a water supply could be made outside tne town, but no such arrangements are possible at present. The Imperial Bank of Persia are now considering the question of selling the house at present occupied by their hanager, and building another house for him outside the town, close to the garden which I shoul like to get for the new Consulate, for exactly the same reasons as I have advanced for the transfer of the Consulate, viz., the unhealthiness of the present surround ings • 4. I discussed the matter with Sir Robert Clive during my recent visit to Tehran: he said th t of course he had never seen Meshed but the proposal seemed to him an eminently reason able one: it was always unpleasant for Europeans to have to reside in an Oriental city devoid of sanitation, and pre ferable that they should live outside. 5. as regards the question of our right to dispose of the land, the present site was acquired by private purchase, the title deeds are in my office, it is owned outright by Govern ment and we are free to dispose of it in any manner we please. - In these circumstances I trust that the G-overnment of India will be pleased to take into favourable consideration the proposal advanced in my letter referred to above. 3 d.

My dear Lancelot, I enclose a copy of a letter from Biscoe of Meshed making certain^proposals for the move of the Consulate-General outside the town. You will see that he says India has agreed, and indeed the proposals seem excellent. I am not however clear whether London have been approached by India direct. I imagine that both the Foreign Office and the Treasury are interested. The Shall being away I can, for the moment, take no action, but as Biscoe seems in a hurry I should be grateful if you could let me have a short telegram if the proposals are approved. It seems odd that India should not have informed us officially. From Biscoe’s letter it would seem that Clive has already agreed to the desirability of moving from the present site, but there is apparently nothing on paper about it. Yours ever, (Signed) R.C. Parr. Lancelot Oliphant, Esquire, C.M.G., The Foreign Office.(3 9°M. • 0 • nO • «3k-&lt; • British Uonsiilate-Croneral, lleohe&amp; t The 26th July, 1928. hear Parr, When this Consulate -General vra.3 originally built some thirty years ago, it wag situated on the outskirts of the town and 3uri*ounded by gardens • : eshed has sinoe ^rown oonsiderably and tho Consulate-General is now sur rounded by houses on all sides and situated ri^ht insido the town and the only thing that nahes it at all tolerable is the faot tliat wo have spaoioua gardens. A suggestion was made in my predecessor’s time that it should be transferred outside the town, but nothing definite was decided. Soon after ny arrival in January 1927, however, the Agenoy surgeon submitted a report to me that in his opinion the present site of the Consulate- General was an unhealthy one, the -uestion of water-supply presented great difficulties and it would be preferable to move outside the town. There were several difficulties in the way of the proposal, chief of which was the financial one. The present site has, of course, become exceedingly valuable and was worth a great deal more than land outside the town; on the other hand, there were not many people who were in a position to put down 100,000 Tomans, which is the approximate value of the present site and buildings and also X could not vacate the present Consulate-General until a new one had been constructed, and would therefore have had to have asked Government to advance ms about £20,000, for the purchase of a new site andand construction of the requisite 'buildings on it t which sun I should only have been able to refund at the end of two or three years, and even then I could not have civen a definite guarantee that T should he able to get for the existing site and buildings their full estinated value. \ny such arrangement would have involved me in consider able financial difficulties with the Treasury at Home and the Accounts people in India. I therefore discussed the matter with an enterprising and reliable Indian contractor in Meshed; he said that he was willing to buy me a suit able garden selected by me outside the town and erect on it buildings similar to the present bullsings; and the arrangement was that when these had been constructed to ny| satisfaction, I was to hand him over the existing site and buildings and he woula dispose of them and oa]ce what profit he oould on the transaction. ITo cash v/as to change hands. The Government of India directed me to discuss the matter with Sir]b Kobert Clive and I did so during ny visit to fohran lust October. The i'inister was good enou$i to approve of my proposals and I reported in this sense to the Government of India. A good deal of delay lias occurred over the matter, presumably oecause i- hua tc *• —* “* 1 '“ ,c ^ a ‘i**-#* the Oovernment of India a&amp;yin^ that my proposal, h-ave bee] accepted and tha.t orders follow by post. I a^'Anxlous ti f:et on with the natter as quickly as possible, and should like to Imy a garden this autTinn t collect materials sud layout la\ms, flower beds, etc, during the winter and &amp;ta: houses would be ready for occupation, though possibly &lt; not entirely completed, by the following winter.There is # however, one difficulty in the way of acquiring land in the vioinliy of Tie shod, namely, that a great deal of it belongs to the shrine and Shrine land oannot be permanently alienated* Further, under the present arrangements, it oannot ordinarily be leased for a longer period than years; I have, however, discussed the nutter with the WUtawali-Bashi and he tello no that with the speoial sanction of His Kajesty The Shah, Yiio ia ex-officio head of the Shrine, leases can be granted for longer periods such as 90 or 90 years, and further, that if at the end of the lease, the shrine wishes to resume the land, they must pay the cost of all buildings erected on the land and of improvements effected. I have looked at various possible sites and, as a matter of fact, the choice is very limited, 1 because I must bo within, say, one mile of the town, and require a garden of preferably njt less than 30000 square ^ura with a good water supply. The garden that most nearly^ fulfils my requirements is one belonging to the Shrine but leased to one Mirza. Hazir Yaiiya; the latter is very hard up anc is anxious to sell it, cr rather the trees, buildings, etcetera, in it and the balance of the lease for what he oan get cwid the contractor is willing to buy it. The only matter therefore that really remains to be fixed up is to IL! get a long lease from the Shrine and the Ilutawali Bashi tells mo that if His I.2ajesty the ;hah coiisults him, he will help me ■ as much as he can* f j X am therefore writing to as3c you if you could very kindly approach -is rajesty The &gt;hah in the matter through whatever channel you may consider suitable, and say that the British Government wish to transfer the Consulate-General here outside the town and to dispose of the present site and-4- /■v and oonatract a Consulate In sorae garden on the outsiirt of the city;, I do not think it is necessary or desirable at present to specify tho particular garden on which I have la^id my oye ; and the best thing: to do would be to say that as many of these gardens belong to the Shrine, you v/ould be glad to know whether in the event of the Consul- General desiring to obtain a lease of one of them, His rajesty would authorise, in the special circumstances of the case, the Shrine aut orltles to grant a lease for, say, 90 years, since it is obviously out of the question to erect a Consulate-General which we might be turned out of in, say, 25 years. If His majesty would accord his approval to this in principle, then perhaps he could instruct the llut&amp;w&amp;ll Bashi of the Shrine to discuss the matter with mo here and I could let the latter know which garden I want and he could submit his proposals to Kis Fajesty for formal sanction.

Before the War, the Budget Allotment for Secret Service was included in the Office Allowance grant and was estimated at Rs»4,000 jurmsssHB per annum*. 3. In those days the Consul General paid little attention to affairs in Russia, which were watched by the Military attache* Afghan news was reported by the salaried Agent at Herat and in a lesser degree by his brother at K*rez* The whole grant cf Rs* 4,000 was expended on purveyors of local news and in presents to officials* 4. During the Tar, the Military Intelligence system was greatly expanded, and news agents were stationed at many places, supervised by British Officers at Bujnurd, Bejgirsn, Euchan and / elsewhere* 5. When the Kalmiss Mission was withdrawn, the Military Attache kept on many of the news agents especially on the frontiers. These men interviewed arrivals from Russia and Afghanistan and often gave us news which could not have been obtained in Meshed* 6 # Since the reduction of the Military Attache's establish* ment, /Eient, I have found it necessary to retain five of the agents - at Bujnurd, Bejgiran, Kuchan,Lutfrbad end Sarakhs for the fallow ing reasons (a) at Bujnurd. iigent is in the Sardar’s service^ He reports news of the frontier Turkomans, and events on the Railway between Krasnovodsk and ^skhsbed, besides acting as my intermediary with the Chief of Bujnurd* (bj at Bejgiran# This is the Persian Customs Station on the Askhabad road. Russian and Persian officials mingle here. (c) at Kuchan* The Headquarters of ? district containing turbulent Kurd Khans, some of whom are in close touch with the Bolsheviks- Ksny Russians halt here on their way from askhabed to Meshed* (d) at Lutfabsd. Opposite ^rtiq railway Station.Travellers from north east Turkestan often come by this route. {a) at Sarakhs* Por ne?/s of Kushk and Takht-i-Bazar. There is often friction here between Russian and Persian Officials on account of the raids of Jsmshedis and Baluchis. 7. In addition, in consequence of the death of the late Agent at Karez and the abolition of the Herat appointment, it is proposed to keep a Persian agent at Karez for the present tentatively to report Afghan news, which will be collected from arrivals from Herat. 3. The Salaries of these six agents are Tomans 40 each.Total 240 Tomans per mensem. In Meshed, news reporters, who interview as many arrivals as possible from abroad besides recording all loc?4 news,number six including a translator, and ccs f Tomans 16?. This includes the remuneration of 'casuals'* The contingencies, including postage, telegrams and travell~%* ing charges, amount to Tomans 45. Tho total monthly expenditure is therefore Tomans 450 out of which the Military Attache is paying Tomans 95 from his small grant. All the news relating to Russia and Afghanistan is dealt with by him, and as he has no clerk he natureHv =&gt;, •&gt; ‘ r - ? res in the' - v / i. the trsnslPtor^ p®y # 9, I'y nonthly net expenditure is therefore eetimeted et 370 Tomans 355« the current ouarte^s rate of ezchf’nre this is • ^(rans it ^uol equivalent to Rs # 946. i \ Ivj* 10* Mj actual expenditure in the first quarter of the financial ■ year ^as Erans 11595 shahis 6, equivalent to Rs*3246-15-3 at the rate of 345 Erans per Rs.100* 11* I therefore suggest a consolidated grant of Rs*12000 per annurr: for Secret Service, necessitating an addition of Rs*8000 to the present figure* It will he remembered that the other expenditure under my Office Allowance has been reduced by Rs*60OO, I have, etc*, Sd*F*B*Prideeux, Lt * Ool*, K*B*II f s Consul General and Agent of the Government of India in Ehoresen* ■ r ij Secret* Government of India* Forei^yi and Political Department.
