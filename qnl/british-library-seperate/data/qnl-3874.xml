Reference is made to the presence of Major Richard Bird from the oil company and that the information differed from that collected in 1908 by John Gordon Lorimer. An additional 'more accurate' note (ff 25-27) by Major Bird on the Al Bu Shamis is included.The notes provide information on each tribe under the following sections: allegiance to the two major tribal confederations of Oman (Ghafiri and Hinawi); names of chief shaikh and second in importance; tribal sub-divisions; area and villages inhabited; estimated population and strength in rifles; followed by a note on the prevalent behaviour and history of inter-tribal relationships and conflict.Tribes assessed in this manner are found in three parts of the report:the tribes of Buraimi and Trucial Oman: Na'im, Beni Ka'ab, the Manasir, the 'Awamir, Beni Qitab, Beni Qatar;Abu Dhabi tribes in Buraimi: al Dhawahir, Al Nawsir, al Najadat, al Kuwaitat, the Beni Yas;Muscat and Oman tribes: Al Duru, Al Jinibah, Al Wahibah, Bidah, Beni Yezid, Beni Ali, Ya'aqib, Hawasinah, Beni Umar, Beni Jabir, Baluch, Beni Gheith, Maqabil, Kund.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Buraimi</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000394#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
