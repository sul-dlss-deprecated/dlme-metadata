Such maps as we have got of the Geography of Oman (so far as I know) are very meagre and very inaccu rate in the information which they afford, and whether owing to the frequent changes in the British representa tion at Muscat during the last decade or so nl conse quent want of interest in or opportunities fo r investiga ting the Geography of the interior or other cause this office is particularly badly supplied with maps. The best I have got ( and I have only the one tattred copy no sent) forming enclosure No. 1 to this letter, was compiled by Col.Ross in the seventies on the basis of Wellsted's original map with additions from native sources and (I oelieve) lithographed in Bombay. Besides which I have sheet enc]osure No.8. of a map compiled by t your deparment m 1883 of which sheet No.1.forms enclo sure No.l.^heet No. 2. not forth coming ^probably inclu des Oman, and all information known up to that year. Since then so far as I know nothing has been issued. During the year that I have been representing Govt.in Muscat I have been with Arabic and. poJ itical work that A I have not been able to make any extended Journeys into the interior, but from my own limited experience I am able to say that even within a radius of 40 miles around Muscat the information given in such maps as I have gotis not my only scanty but in many details altogether inac curate . I look forward in the future to getting more leisure for moving about in the country and have the permission of Govt, to make the most of my opportunities. Apart therefore from the presumption that Government would welcome on general grounds any extension of our information regarding the in terior of Oman; as a member of the R.G.5 / I feel some ooligation to make what humble use I can of the opportuni ties that futh* in my way of adding to the accurate know ledge of the Geography of Oman in the hope of being ulti mately able to produce fX more useful map that we can ooast of • To this end I venture to ask the help of your department. Yours sincerelyForeign Office, Calcutta, the £ ^ February W02 . 'OC Please refer to your official letter No.9,dated the 4th January 1902,requesting sanction to a grant of Rs.2629/2 to cover the cost of mathematical instruments supplied by the Survey Department to the Maskat Agency. /•ill you please let me know why the instruments were purchased,and,if for any special purpose,whether they could not be returned when no longer required? I seem to remember that the instruments were purchas ed in connection with the exploration in Sur,but the office have been unable to find the papers .Can you give the necess ary reference? v 0/iu Captain P.Z.Cox, Political Agent at Maskat. ijvn'Muscat February 15th 1902. I think the accompaniment will give you the clue you require regarding the supply of mathemati cal instruments to this Agency. I gathered from Major Hodgson that the adjustment of the cost was purely a paper transaction not affecting budget allotments. I asked for the instruments originally, because I thought they would be given on loan and that by experi menting in the vicinity of Muscat I could select and learn the method best adapted for surveying in this country. Experience since gained teaches me that as long as I travel as an official, any satisfactory survey work will be very difficult, as one is 'nursed*' so care fully; Nevertheless I would ask to be allowed to keep the instruments as long as I am here, and to return them before leaving Muscat.My dear Cox, I have shewn to the Viceroy your letter to Wood about Mr.D.D.Dickson*s wish to explore the interior of Oman* The Government of India have no desire to facilitate the travels of Mr.Dickson,and if the Sultan is reluctant to assume any responsibility for his protection while in the in- -terior of Oman,you can reply to him to that effect. 'We have papers showing that in November 1898 he ap- -plied for permission to visit Chinese Turkistan for the pur- -poseJof trade,and he seems to have represented himself to the local ofxicers as a man of business,who had dealt in various commodities in different parts of the world.Probably .therefore motive for desiring to visit Oman is commercial rather than scientific,and he may possibly have heard of the coal find at Sur.

My clear Kemball, In a letter to you darted 26*th Dec. 1900 Cox mentioned that he might ask f.or privilege *) % in order to visit the interior. We were about to suggest that Cox might repeat the expe riment of Lieut. Colonel Miles and travel about during the hot weather in the interior of Oman. See Col.Miles' note of tour through Oman and El Dhahien of which copies were sent to you with th£ letter from the Govern- ment of India in Eoreign Department No. 8556 E. 16th October 1886. Such a course while enabling the Political Agent to escape the extreme heat of Muscat Would afford him opportunities '* for gausing the popular fe|lin^4 and for judging what steps might be taken to consolidate the Sultan's authority and to % » 1 * popularize his rule. Tha tou» * or tours could of course only be carried out with the consent of the Sultan but should you see no objection Cox may be authorised to sound His Highness on the subject and to put forward definite pro posals for the consideration of the Government of India. Should the Sultan rase no objection to the idea Cox would travel on duty there is no necessacity for him to take leave. Have you seen Southern Arabia f a book recently published by Theodore Bent's widow 7 It contains a good deal of interesting matter and in particular some personage event Dhofar and the Fair at Dubat which Cox might like to know 7 .

Please refer to your demi-official letter dated the 28th February 1903, regarding the adjustment of expendi ture incurred by you during your travels in the interior of Oman. The expenditure cannot be sanctioned on a demi-of- iicial reference and must form the subject of ah official application, which should show what the total expenditure incurred was, how much can be met from grants at your dis posal by reappropriation or otherwise, and what the balan ce is. If any portion of the expenditure is of an extra- ordinary nature and such as is'not usually debitable to Government, the circumstances in which it i s considered proper that Government should bear the charge should be explained.^ /6S SIR, I have the honor to revert to Foreign Depart ment letter Wo.1863 E.A. dated 31st October 1901 directing me to ascertain the actual limits of* the authority ot the Sultan of Muscat in the direction of Cape Mussundum. ..This duty was undertaken f during the financial year 1902-1903 just concluded, and Jshe result forwarded under this office letter No.290 dated 2nd July 1903 to the address of the Resident, but no bill was subvvitted at the time for expenses incurred during that tour, and on my subsequent %urn to Muscat by land, partly owing to the fact that I was fcr*~Lrz. , t . anxious to submit an account of the jourttey^ at the same time^ and partly in the hope that it might prove possible during the course of the financial year to debit some of the expenses^to grants at my disposal or by re-appropriation. Owing to subsequent absence from Muscat however and press of work since mjf return I have not been able so lar to do more than give an outline of the journey in the Annual Administra tion Report and as to the expenses incurred it has not been possible to debit any considerable amount to avaii&amp;ble tunds. I have now therefore the honor to submit a summary of expenses and trust that the Government of India will see its way to issue special sanction for the amount asked tor. 3. Compared to travelling conditions holding in IndiaIndia the cost of a two months' tour in Oman will perhaps ap pear heavy, but, in my opinion, the occasional expenditure is worth the while and the scale is only on a par with that of Colonel Miles, the only one of my predecessors oflate years who had any opportunities for travel. In the first place the tours largely increase the personal in fluence of the British Agent in Oman, which is an indirect ad vantage to Government, and'in the second place the acquaintance of the Political Agent with the Shaikhs anci^eography of Oman and his consequent ability obn occasion to make unofficial sug gestions not infrequently leads to reconciliation between the Sultan and individual Bedouin Shaikhs^and it al&amp;o happens some times that neighbouring tribes who have &amp;ad differences honor the occasion of the (f&gt;f presence of the Political Agent and his party in their midst to settle their differences, or let bygones be bygones. The great drawback is that under present conditions and^ne readiness of French^to attribute sinister motives to the conduct of the British representative, any systematic survey work is rendered impossible.Memorandum of expenditure incurred during tour of Politi cal Agent Muscat in Oman during April and May 1902.

ROUTE TAKEN BY MAJOR P.Z.COX, ON A JOURNEY FROM ABU THABI TO MUSCAT OVERLAND MAY &amp; JUNE 1902. ABU THABI TO BEREYMI :- Distance about 100 miles. Zwemer has already given an account of this part of the route in a recent number of the Royal Geographical Society's Journal a (January 1902) and as I traversed most of it during the night and there were tew landmarks I was unable to use my compass systematically• Camel seemed plentiful at Abu Thabi, but owners were unwilling to take their beasts beyond Ber^mi and for that /i distance as^ed from three to four dollars per camel, in addition to which they expect hirer to purchase Loosan grass for their c amine Is bet ore starting, and at the termination of the journey^ little or no grazing being found on the way. The general direction of the tract followed was a little south of East, about 115*. The landmark mentioned by Zwemer and called 'Hisn Iblis' was known to my escort by a different name -'Narsaila'. It no doubt bears different names among different tribes. The journey appears to have taken Zwemer only 35 hours but ac- //&gt; ^ cording to my experience he overestimates the pace of the Oman A camel when he puts it at 5 miles per hour. The journey took my Caravan whose movements I timed very carefully, 41 hours from the sea to the winter quarters of my 'Khafeer' Shaikh, on the western outskirts of Bereymi. (vide map). These 41 hours were made up as follows. Abu Thabi to El—Iviaktaa Creek. ,4 hours * El-Maktaa to Narsaila or Hisn Iblis S-f ' Narsaila to Waterholes (1) 11 ** Waterholes(l) to Howeil Wells(2) 6 ' Howeil Wells(2) to Waterholes(3) 10 ' 'Waterholes(5) to edge of Bereymi, Oasis 4-1- ' Total 41 hours % I think the distance cannot be much less than 100 miles puttingput,t/ing the rate of the Caravan at 2jr miles per hour. For many miles before nearing Bereymi the tract where any exists, passes over undulating downs amd dunes of sand which from time to time obscure the view in front, but for a long distance before one reaches one's destination the peak of Jebel Hafeet furnishes a us-eful guide for direction. On getting near the outskirts of the Oasis and looking southwards along the valley of the Wadi Batha on sees a series of sand dunes and hummocks stretching away southwards apparently in continuation of Hafeet, but in reality they are not, and as one finds out later they are situated a good deal to the south and west and are not in prolongation of it. Possibly it was the sight of these dunes as Zwemer approached Bereymi from the Abu Thabi side that caused a. him to fall into Wellsted's error regarding the supposed 'Okabat' or M Okdat M Range, which as Miles has long pointed out is purely mythical.-- Hafeet is one solitary hill rising straight out of the plain. It is probably 1500 ft. high. By the word M Bereymi' as used in Oman is understood the whole of the Bereymi Oasis, comprising not only the village from which the settlement takes its name but /LckXevtr&amp;A,, also the neighbouring villages of Jimi, Hili, Suareh, Ain, Motariz Yahali. The three last named get their water-supply by means of the usual underground aqueducts from Jebel Hafeet; the remaining villages look to the Range to the north for it, BBRBYMI TO HAFEET 18 miles. I had to wait^for three days before I could get fresh camels. Leaving the encampment of my host and guide on the western edge of the Oasis, we passed through Motariz, Yahali and Ain, the second of which villages is a recent settlement inaugurated and fostered by Shaikh Zaeed bin Khalifeh of Abu Thabi on a tract of ground reclaimed by him at the base of one of the re entrants ofJebel Hafeet. It seems to be in a thriving condition but the date groves have not yet arrived at maturity. Ain was 4 miles from the start. From Ain the tract turns southwards and runs para- lel to the base of Hafeet but keeping a little distance away from it in order to avoid the boulders and talus lying close under the hil]. The form of the country here is level stony plain stretching away\3P/ » vy TO HAPEET (continued) away to the ilajar Eange on the West, and studded with mimosa bushes and acacias. During the cold- weather months shepherds and their families from the Naeem and Awamir tribes wander about the plain with their fi'ocks and tents returning to their permanent habitations at Ain and Hafeet at the commencement of the date harvest. Hafeet is about 18 miles from Ain of Bereymi. It consists of three separate but almost contiguous settlements (1) Boobgharrah (or Abu Gharrah) (2) Hafeet (3) i fbasUa' . They are quite close together and unseparatable when vieUhd from a distance and are hfctsCtCicC &amp; wrongly shown an Yfolutoojd's Map. Generally speaking they are all included in the parent village 'Hafeet”. A- short 2 miles to the south is the village of Kabil, not to be confounded with the more important town of Kabil in the Sharkiyeh country. The water at Hafeet is good and abundant. HAFEET TO DTHANK 45 MILES. At first the route leads over the same shingly plain as before hare devoid of vegetation or almost so, but later as one app roaches the wells of Moofiyeh, 7 hour by caravan, the mimosa and acacia vegetation appears again and becomes gradually more plentiful. The village of Moofiyeh is only a nomad one composed of Abu Shamis shepherds and their families housed in blanket or mat Wigwams with their flocks of goats. It is diff icult to arrive at any reliable estimate of such flocks but the total of those scattered over the broad plain lying between Bereymi and Dthank must amount to many thousands. The population of Moofiyeh is about 150 . 14 miles more through the same class of country bring the tra veller to the Bedouin wells and village of Buzeili also belong ing to the Abu Shamis, and containing about 200 souls. Seneynah, another of their villages, lies about 4 miles to the Southwards across the plain which as far as the eye can reach has plentiful mimosa vegetation but merges at no great distance into the Ruba-el- Khali. Dthank is 12 miles further on, the country being of the same character and reminding me very much of the 'Baud' of Somali land. An hour before Dthank is reached the Wadi Abu Kurba crosses the tract and its sandy bed and banks thickly clad withHAFEET TO DTHANK (continued) with tamarisks afford a pleasant change to i. ■ ' 4 i... the eye after the monotony of the country ip. traversed since leaving Bereymi. Dthank is an important and prosperous town containing some 4000 inhabitants and mostly permanent buildings of sundried brick and • bub jJr. • ; . i i ; . : i j: ■ • ,. n is pleasantly situated at the mouth of the precipitous opening in the Hajar Range formed by the exit of the Wadi Dthank, in which ■ ’ n.'-' ■ : • - : water was trickling above ground at the time I passed. It possess- es fine orchards and date groves and there is a little cultivation on the outskirts of the town, chiefly Karbi and Loosan grass for the consumption of their draft bullocks,of which there are about 200 in the town,employed for irrigation purposes. Hafeet can just be nade out when the atmosphere is at its clearest i’ j . .i. r, but this is the last point from which it can be seen. The tract of country between Bereymi and Dthank had not previously ? » % • i l i ' ; been traversed by any European, but Dthank itself was visited by - 'O’, oj . •. ; j.t, ,, . . oi fi - ; u . v Colonel S.B.Miles from the southwards. He arrived there from Obri * . i J J J . 'I ^11 »tj ‘ and made it the turning point of his journey, travelling up the ’ Wadi Dthank and so on via Yenlial and Rostak to Muscat. His route which is shown by a green dotted line in the accompaning sketch- map is only conjectural, as he has left no map of his journey. DTHAHK TO MAZUM 14 miles. From Dthamk the tract turns back to the South-Eastfor some miles in order to clear a spur thrown out into the plain from the main range. The point of this spur is passed at 6 miles and the tract ) . then turns to the left up a broad re-entrant where the soil which ,o Letissnej ©ajs UBjpSffti i ius r ^ . .&gt; 4 .... , &lt; . 5 _ , has hitherto been of the shingly nature so far prevalent becomes more sandy and ascends gradually towards the Apex of the valley, where it rises suddenly over the col on the low hill known as It'. * *- : . j . . . Jebel Felaij and drops down into the village of Mazum on the south' i i &gt;• - O f J l. . . ern side of it. A cluster of hamlets of the Beni Kaab Imown as ‘ ~ / 1 ; .. . Mamur or the Felaij of the Beni Kaab is seen and left a couple of ^ J ■«. &gt; . miles away to the right. The passage over the col just mentioned ' ' - • t ; t j * ’ y 4 J ’ , is difficult for camels on account of the boulders with which it oaC .j■‘ jy ■ , is strewn, and the descent on the southern side is steep, but all .if* t . f *4 V ? difficulties and obstructions could be moved with very little troubleA?HANK TO MAZUM trouble. ^ v (continued) Hlazuin is a strongly walled village with a somewhat imposing guarded entrance and is tenanted by a colony of Baloochis who have resided there for many generations and are allied for offensive and defensive purposes to the Beni Kattab. They have so far maintained their distinct Balooch type of feature but now intermarry with Arabs. They have practi cally no communication with the Oman Coast their import and export trade being entirely with Abu Thabi and Debai. MAZUM TO OBRI 18 to 19 miles. After leaving Mazum the tract passes over an undulating waste # * now stony now sandy and with sparse vegetation. About half way a cluster af low hills lie away to the southwards and relive the monotony a little. At 17|- miles the path rises over the neck separating the small hill overlooking Obri from a promin ent spur from the main range and from the crest of it a good viewis obtained of the extensive basin below containing the villages of .Ghubbi, Araki, Beit-e-Ainein and Dereez and stretching for a good many milesto the North Eastward towards the base of Jebel Misht and Khewr. The town of Obri itself is buried in an enormous expanse of date groves. Setting asid the Semail Valley the banks of which are lined almost without a break from its nejd near Mutiy to to Finjeh, with a wide belt of date gardens, Obri possesses the widest extent of date cultivation that I have met with in r ' ,,v any single town of Oman hitherto visited. The cluster of mud houses centred round the fort and Bazaar are tenanted by the poorer portion of the population; every land-owner large and small has his own house and those of his relations dotted about in the shade of the date groves so that the habitations are very scattered. Fruit and grass is plentiful and there is extensive cultivation both in the date-groves and outside in the open. The population cannot be less than 7000. Indigo dying is the chief industry and the hands and faces of the working population are chronically besmeared with it. Obri has been str&lt;l fully described by Welsitsaid and Miles. It is to be noted the positionsMA.ZUM TO OBRI positions of Ainein, Ghubbi,Araki, Dereez and (continued) Ariz in the existing map (Col Ross's) are al together wrong. Apparently the points of the compass have been reversed in plotting out. OBRI TO KUBBARA 22 miles. Starting from the fort of Obri and winding through a laby rinth of orchards one emerges into the bed of the broad Wadi on the bank of which Obri lies and after crossing it a small tract of higher ground intervenes before.one drops again into another dry watercourse, the Wadi Seleyf, which also flows southwards and effects a junction with the Wadi Obri a little lower down at Debayshi then flowing onwards past Tennam the headquarters of the Deroo tribe. At the point where one meets it, coming from Obri, the Wadi Seleyf has just emerged from a natural gateway formed by it in forcing its way through an isolated chain of low narrow hills about 300 feet high. The village of Seleyf, which is about 2 miles from the fort of Obri is in two divisions, one on each side of the Wadi. It has a small fort perched upon the summit of the Eastern bank overlooking the aqueduct bn the edge of the Wadi below.Seleyf is practically a suburb of Obri. After leaving Seleyf the road follows the Wadi in the direction of Jebel Khewr but at 10 miles after circumventing the. spur shown in the sketch turns to the southwards and crosses and recrosses the Wadi Seleyf. Finally it leaves the Wadi bed altogether and the rest of the way to Kubbara is over fairly level and easy ground. Viewed from Seleyf village the Wadi Seleyf looks as if it ought to rise in the Jebel Khewer* but from,the]manner in which it breaks away to the S.E. before reaching Kubbara it is evident that such is not the case and I think it must rise in the low hills just south of Seleyf. The road from Obri to Kubbara offers no difficulties what ever, as the Wadi bed is shingly and free from boulders, and once you quit its banks you are on sandy soil. Kubbsra is a very small hamlet of the Beni .Gessas, about 50 souls, subject to the Yakoobi element at Obri. At the time I was there the inhabitants were in very straitened circumstances^pwing to the continued drought. Their felejes were failing and their date trees languishing for want of rain.^OBRTI TO KUBBARA s (continued) The village is overshadowed by the lofty Jebel Khewr the crest of which appears to be about 10 miles away, KUBBARA TO SAIFAM About 27 miles. My cara van took 11 hours. The tract at first turns Eastward towards Jebel Khewr in order to avoid some broken ground, then it debouches into a broad triangular valley formed by the con vergence of the Jebel Khewr with Jebel Hadda. The col joining the two systems at the apex of the triangle forms the water shed dividing the Dhahireh district from the'Jauf' of Oman and is known as the 'Nejd-ul-Mmkharim. 'Nejd' always meaning in Oman 'high ground where the waters divide'.' The route from Obri N Sait am by this pass has not before been traversed by a European. It offers little difficulty and must be much easier than the pass crossed by Miles at the northern extremity of Jebel Khewr known as the Akabat-el-Barak. Coming from the Kubbara side one comes abreast of the summit of Jebel Hadda at 7 miles, facing which on the opposite side of the valley can be seen a deep cleft in the side of Jebel Khewr from which the Wadi Ain takes its rise. A little beyond the cleft and on the same side lie the villages of Dan and Nadan with their green date groves standing out in relief against the barren slopes of the mountain. The country passed through between Kubbara and the nejd is a sandy plain sprinkled with mimosa scrub and thickly strewn with talus from the mountain The ascent to the crest of the col is very gradual and offers no difficuty out the descent which winds down the rocky bed of a torrent took us hall an hour to negociate and is not easy for laden camels. Mine were lightly loaded however and I had no mishap. Prom the crest af the Nejd a good view is obtained of what is known as the 'Jauf' of Oman proper, as opposed to the Dhahireh district which we have just left. The word 'Jauf' signifies literally the hollow^oi anything' and used geographically conveys the meaning oi heart', 'basin' or 'crater'. In the present case 'basin' seems most appropriate, for as one takes in the view from the pass the tract of country below presents that appear ance. The basin is bounded on the west by the Jebel Khewr; on the norththe north by. the Jebel Akhdar range and on the south by the Jebel Hamra or ' Red Mountains”. This Jebel Hamra range is very much in evidence from Nejd-el-Makharim and although as before mentioned no traveller has used this route before the range can be easily seen from Gabrin and also from the top of the Jebel Akhdar, and I am therefore surprised at its not having been mentioned by Wellsted or Miles. Jebel Hz dda, which is connected with Jebel Khewr by the Nejd-el-Makharim, forms the north-west extremity of the range and viewed from the pass the range stretch es away as far as the eye can reach in an Easterly direction inclining to South East. It seems to be of a different geo logical formation altogether to that represented by the Jebel Khewr and JebSl Akhdar and is probably red sand stone. During the day-time it looks terra cotta in colour and it is from this circumstance it gets its native name of Jebel Hamra or Red Range. On reaching the plain below the pass the tract turns sharply to the left and bears alonj.the base of Khewr to the village of Saifam lying at an altitude of 1900 feet. This is a flourishing village of the Beni Shekeyl and lies on the bank of a Wadi of the same name rising in the northern slopes of Khewr. Saif sun is overshadowed by one of the principal peaks of Khewr, which must be about 7000 feet in altitude. The village is only a short distance from the northern pass, the 'Akabat-el-Barak', but the latter is generally approached from the Tanoof direction via the Wadi .Ghol. -1 SAIF AM TO .GIBRIN AND BAHIA 7± and 11|- miles respectively. The going is good. The whole of this 'basin' before referred to is thickly studded with small conical hills of igneous rock and must have been at one time subject to volcanic action. Gibrin which is reached easily in three hours is said to have been a place of some importance in days gone by and its very spacious and pretensions fort supports this statement, but its glory has long since departed and at present it is simply the private estate and summer resort of the Uttoobi Shaikh of Bahia. It consists of the Fort before mentioned, (now in a very ruined condition) 5 s SAIFAM ( GABRIN ‘ NEZWAH 1 surroundedSAIFAM TO GIBRIN AND BAHI-A surrounded by somewhat, scanty date * (continued) plantation; a 1‘ew fields under cultiva tion, and the dwellings of the small community which works on the estate. From Gibrin Bahia is 4 miles in a north-easterly direction. Bahia is a fine town which has been described by Wellsted and Miles. From Bahia is the road to Tanoof winding in and around the series of sugar-loaf hillocks before referred to . After visiting Bahia I rejoined my party at Gabrin. •GABRIN TO NEZWAH 25 Miles. The going is good. At lirst over undulating ground and winding round the low hills: then, at 7 miles, Jebel Kameeleh is passed with the village of Temseh close by on the right. Colonel Miles* route between Mennah and Bahia is here crossed. At 20 miles the traveller reaches Rhbdda and almost contiguous Park, both on the Wadi Nezwah. From Rhodda the tract 1 ollows the course of the Wadi Nezwah and date-groves succeed one another on either bank without intermission until Nezwah is reached, about 5 *miles from Rhodda. Nezwah again has been fully described by previous travellers. NEZWAH TO ,TANOQF About 7 miles. Up the bed of the Wadi. The going is somewhat tedious and diff icult owing to the boulders. The village of Semmed is contigu ous with the limits of Nezwah but its politics are different. It is the village of one the chief Shaikhs of the Beni Riyam, Hamdan bin Saif. He is the brother of Shaikh Himyar of Tanoof but owing to a long standing blood feud they are inveterate enemies. As however Hamdan has property and some influence among the Beni Riyam of the mountains it is necessary to placate him as well as his brother and it requires care to maintain triendly relations with both. Tanoof has already been describ ed. It is a somewhat uninteresting village situated in a cramp ed position lacing the cleft in the range formed by the exit ot the Wadi .Tanoof. The village is close up against the cliffs. Transport is very scarce and difficult to procure, the natives seeming to have barely enough for their own requirments and no marginNEZWAH TO TAITOOF margin for hire. Donkeys of course are the (continued) only beasts of burden in use between Jebel Akhdar and Nezwah, consequently I had sent on my camel caravan from Nezwah, to meet me at Mutiy or Siemail on descending fi*om the mount ains, and with difficulty obtained 4 donkeys wherewith to negociate the Range. TANOOF TO 3HEREYJEH 21 Miles. It is advisable to say something here about the spelling of 'Shereyjeh”. It is spelt thus in the existing map and in my opinion this is the correct form. Wellsted spells it 'Sherazi' which does not represent the pronunciation in the least but was doubtless ad opted by that traveller from the idea that the name was connected with 'Shiraz'. Colonel Miles adopting the same theory spells it 'Sheraizi' which he considers to be a diminutive form of Sheraz. I believe they have both gone off the tract. At all events the name is spelt by the natives of the place and of Oman generally ' Shereyjeh, and is so pronounced by them, some pronouncing the Jeem as a 'G', as is the common habit of Arabs,and calling it *Shereygeh''.. My belief is supported by the fact that the village under reference is not the only one of that name in Oman. There is another Shereyjeh near Seeb, a small coast town north of Muscat, which is spelt and pronounced in the same way,and the more natural derivation of the name, and one supported by native opinion is that tire word is a dimin utive of Sherjeh ( ) an Arabic word commonly used to mean 'a place from which water flows out t of rocky ground down on to soft ground'. From this word Shereyjeh ( r j\ )is the regular form of diminutive and its meaning is true to nature in the present case. The inhabitants of Jebel Akhdar nowadays intermafry habitually with the Beni Riyam of the plains and vice-versa and do not admit any origin or interest distinct from theirs. A description of the route from Tanoof to the crest is given by Wellsted but I did not find it nearly so difficult as it appeared to him, though I must have followed practically the same tract. There would be no great difficulty in making the ascent passable for camels and for a laden donkey or mule it presents no difficulties. The WaterholetiA, (iy l.Jj'OOF TO SHKREYJEH (continued) The Waterhole occuring about 4 hours from Tanoof is a large natural reservoir in the Rocks, in which the rain water accumulates. At 16 miles the Wadi Beni Habeeb is reached, containing two contiguous villages of the same name, locally distinguished, as are many settlements similarly situated by the names of M AIN ,, and M AKR'. Saik is hours walk from Wadi Beni Habeeb and the western section of the Shereyjeh settlement 1-|- miles further on. As in the case of Bereymi and Hafeet, the name Shereyjeh in cludes the parent village and also the adjoining parishes of ,, AIN ,, and ,, AKR', as at Saik. Shere^eh which lies in terraces on the face of the cliff looking down the Wadi Miyactein towards Burket-el-Moz has been described by Wellsted and Miles. I made the altitude of the village 6300 feet. SHEREYJEH TO MUTIY 21 to 22 Miles. Prom Shereyjeh the path takes a general direction of 150 # and after crossing the Wadi Miakal, in which lies the village of Hail, rises gradually to the Eastern crest of the Jebel Akhdar, the general elevation of which is 7000 feet. Then keeping for some distance at about the same level the tract skirts the con- spicuous peak named Khazr the summit of Which must approach 8000 feet. On reaching the southern face of Khazr the path ZigSagB for some distance down a salient until it reaches a col where there is a small Musjid and resting place for travellers with a well attached. From this point there is a very steep stone staircase, dating from the Persian occupation, descending abruptly into the Wadi Halfein some three thousafid feet below / ' a two hours tiring descent impassable for anything but men and donkeys, and, I should say, only donkeys bred to it. Mutiy lies on the margin of the Wadi Halfein, and is an insig nificant village of the Beni Riyam. For any one undertaking a survey of the Jebel Akhdar this would undoubtedly be the easiest point to s^art in from. From the crest near Jebel Khazr, or better still from the summit of that peak.SHERBYJEH TO MUTIY peak, which is(apparently)an easy on to ne- (continued) gociate a grand panorama view is obtained to the East and South, Zikki Mennah, Adam, the villages of the , A1 Wahibeh, and the great Wadis Halfein and Andam following their tprtuous courses far away to the Southwards. After a rest at Shereyjeh and putting the Southern crest the Surveyor could then start on the Northern crest, overlooking Rostak. From these two points, with two or three points in the plains already fixed a very large extent of country could be filled in. MUTIY TO SEMAIL 28 Miles. The route from here to Muscat is well known and receiving letters here which called for my early presence in Muscat to meet H.M.S. f 'Amphitrite' I rode into Semail during the night. It was a 7 houi*s ride, walk and trot, and I calculate the distance to be at 28 to SO miles. i£ hours north of Mutiy is the Nejd from which the Wadi Halfein and Wadi Beni Ruwahah take their rise. The former flows southwards and afterwards, having joined the Wadi Andam, making O 9 its way to the sea near Mahot Latitude 20 Longitude 58 E. While the Wadi Beni Ruwahah, known later on in its course as the Wadi Semail, flows via Bidbid and Finjeh intoafctte sea at Seeb. I travelled from Semail to Muscat via Finjeh, Bosher and Uhubra and this part of the road is too well known to need remark. I made the distance from Semail to Mutra to be 54 miles. &amp; niQ5J SIMLA. 12th August 1903. Dear Cox, Thanks very Much for yours of BS^h rJuly. I am glad the maps, reached you all right. I am now sending you two copies of the reproduction we have made of your'sketch map. By the way, our draughtsman specialist says all f sorts of nice things as to the care and accuracy of your work, as far as he can judge from a technical point of view. He says he only wishes that a good deal of other work handed to hi* for reproduction was half as satisfactory and understandable. This he has dis covered in fitting in your sketch* at a reduced scale, on the existing map, with a view to the issue of a revised edition, as you suggested. There is only one pjace which he is in doubt about, as to its true position, and that is one which I do not think you visited yourself. But more of this when I send you a proo: ol tm that revised map. I quite agree with what you say as to the advisability of leaving any revised edition on the stone, so as to be able to add any further details.you may be able to give us, after the tours your are contemplating. I am sorry that we are not to see Mrs Cox, here at Simla, this season. I think it is awfully plucky of her to stay at Muscat all the hot weather. * We have just had Gray, from Bander Abbas, here for a week or *e.T\ fie seems &amp; cheery sort, I did not know, till you told me, that the French flag question was to be referred to the Hague Convension.

I fancy you will be hearing from me again pretty soon, about the revised map, so no more at present. fitn kindest regards to Mrs Cox, I am Yours sincerely. :Dear Cox, Thank you ever so much for your last letter, with your notes, and map, of your journey from Abu Thabi to Muscat, as well ^ as the very interesting note on the transport resources of Oman. I am glad to say that your suggestion as to bringing out a revised edition of floss's map, has been approved, and is to be taken in hand at once. Meanwhile your own production is to be reproduced, and I will send you a copy as soon as it is ready. It will then be incor porated , on the smaller scale, in the new edition of the map. Oldham's survey does not appear to have been finished, even yet, by the Survey Dept. Soon after I took over the running of this section, or rather as soon as I had worked it that Arabia should be given over to me, I asked for Oldham’s report, and map. I found that the report was safely reposing somewhere in the bowels of the F.D. though no copy had been sent to us. However, I fancy you must +44(0* ' copycf this report ? The map accompanying it is still in the 'proof” stage, and as such passed through this office, comparative ly lately. As soon as we receive copies of the finished wor : of art from the Surveyor General, r will see that you get one. My own notes, and route sketches, of my tour with you, are still only in manuscript, as press of other work has, till now, made itit impossible to worx them op for printing, or reproduction. Now, however, as the new edition of the map of Oman is to be talren in hand, I hope that we shall be able to'make time” to finish the Meanwhile, I am sending the mounted copies of the existing map&gt;^ N in two separate covers, and hope they have been done as you wished ? You mention the possibility of your being able to send us further information about the country , from native sources. Needless to say, we shall be only too glad to receive anything you may send. Among the blind the one-eyed man is king', and on the same if principle any information is of interest, and valuable, which adds, however little, to our meagre knowledge of that 'terra incognita”^ Arabia. Is there any chance of our seeing you here, before the end of this season ? The rains reached here, at last, on Sunday, and now it is pleasant enough. Your friend Goguyer seems to have been giving the 'Novoe Yreiy^O a rest lately. With kindest regards to Mrs Cox, I am^ Yours sincerely I hope this epistle is not too incoherent ? We are in the throesof aovirig our office* this type-writer is the only kind of writing &lt; material available, and I have been constantly interrupted, to say where various things are to go, in my new room.

Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and Political Agent, Maskst, To-C. L. S. Rnsssu, Esq., Under Seerstary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I am grateful for the sanction kindly accorded, by last mail, to the expenses of my last tour in Oman. In the same connection I enclose for your information copies of a demi-official letter and enclosures which 1 have sent to the Intelligence Branch, Simla. The Road Report is not the report which I had intended to submit to the Foreign Depart ment and I do not think it is of much political interest in its present form. I am at work upon a longer one, as 1 can find time, but in any case it cannot be ready for printing (if of sufficient interest) with the Annual Administration Report for this year. Meanwhile, if the present document is in time, and could be included when the Administration Reports are bound up, I should be glad if that could be done—for this reason, that if recorded in that form, the information is always conveniently available to successive Political Agents at Maskat. [DEMI-OFriOIAI.] Dated Maskat, the 29th June 1903. From—M ajob P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and Political Agent, Maskat, To—C aptain H. H. Dowdino, Intelligence Branch, Simla. I promised Colonel Nixon at Delhi that as soon as I could find the time I would send the Intelligence Branch some notes on the subject of my last Oman trip. The road from Abu Thabito Bereymi and again from Semail to Maskat is well known, but I am sending you by today’s post a compass sketch of the route from Bereymi to the Semail Valley, together with some itinerary notes in explanation thereof. I fear the latter will be of little value from an “ Intelligence ” point of view, but as some of the o-round covered was new and the existing map has proved wrong in several particulars, the results are perhaps worth sending you demi-officially, and though not important will, I know, be of some interest to you personally. As regards my compass sketch, seeing that the latitude and longitude of none of the inland places visited have ever been accurately laid down, the general “ lie ” of it may of course prove a good deal out; but as to the relative positions of adjacent places in regard to one * another and the limits and shape of the features shown, I have every reason to hope that they v. will prove reasonably accurate. I used my compass whenever I could, and made rough dia grams in my field-book of all noticeable features as 1 went along. The main points of interest in the sketch are— (1) The shape and position of Mount Hafeet, not hitherto shown. (2) The country from Bereymi to Dthank has not been traversed before, and the positions of places occuring en route are wrongly shown on the existing map. (3) There is no such mountain as the ‘ f Jebel Okdat or ** Jebel Akabat,” as stated by Wellsted and Zwemer. It is a myth. (4) The person who is responsible for the geography of the country round Obri in the existing map must have inadvertently plotted it out with the points of the compass iC'Crsed ! If you turn the map round and make north south and east west, then the positions occupied by Seleyf, Einein, Deriz, etc., would be more nearly correct.2 (5) From Obri to Gibrin, the route over the Nojdel-Malcharim has not been traversed before, and the not unimportant Jebel Hamra Ran^e now drawn attention to has hitherto not even been mentioned, as far as my knowledge goes^ So much for my sketch. I should like to say a word now about the existing map, the one compiled by Colonel Ross and reprinted by the Intelligence Branch in May 190L Unless and until we eventually have a Protectorate here there is little likelihood, under present conditions, of any regular trigonometrical or other survey being undertaken M eanwhile this map is all we have to go upon. Do you not think that we have enough material to warrant a revised edition ? There is the survey of Oldham’s Surveyor, of the Soor and Jalaan country. r I hen there is your compass sketch of our trip together in the Wadi Tyin and Semail \ alley, which should dovetail in with Miles’sketch of that part of the country published in the Geographical Journal ; and lastly there is my sketch now forwarded. I could also o-ive some more information from native sources which would be valuable for guidance and sub sequent correction. The above references remind me that I have never seen your sketch and Report of our adi Tj in trip of 1901, nor did I get a copy of Oldham’s map of the country we examined for coal. They would both be interesting and useful to this office. I send w ith my sketch map my dilapidated copy of the existing map. Do you think you could get me two more copies—one baoked with linen and entire, for hanging, and the other also backed and made into book form for travelling. Lastly, if there is no likelihood of the Intelligence Branch being able to bring out a new edition of the map wit hin a measurable time, will you kindly let me have my production back or a tracing of it. Notes to accompany Sketch Map of Route taken ly Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., on a journey from Abu Thali to Maskat overland, May and June 1902. Abu Thabi to Bereymi .—Distance about 100 miles. Zwemer has already given an account, of this part of the route in a recent number of the Roval Geographical Society’s Journal (January 1902), and as I traversed most of it during the mglit and there were few landmarks, I was unable to use my compass systematically. Camels seemed plentiful at Abu Thabi, but owners were unwilling to take their beasts beyond Bereymi, and for that distance ask from 3 to 4 dollars per carnal, in addition to which they expect the hirer to purchase loosan grass for their camels before starting and at the termination of the journey, no grazing being found on the way. The general direction of the track followed was a little south of east, about 115. The landmark mentioned by Zwemer and called “Hisnlblis” was known to mv escort by a iffeient name, “ Aarsaila. It no doubt bears different names among different tribes. d he journey appears to have taken Zwemer only 33 hours, but according to my experience be oyer-estimaies the pace ef the laden Oman camel when he puts it at 3 miles per hour, i he journey took my caravan, whose movements I timed very carefully, 41 hours from the sea to the winter quarters of my “ Khafeer ” Shaik, on the western outskirts of Bereymi [vide map). These 41 hours were made up as fellowa :— Abu Thabi to El-Maktaa Creek El-Maktaa to Narsaila or Hisn Iblis ... Narsaila to Waterholes (1) Waterholcs (1) to Howeil wells (2) ... Howeil Wells (2) to Waterholes (3) ... T\aterholes (3) to edge of Bereymi Oasis Total Hours. 4 5* 11 6 10 4* 41 I think the distance cannot be much less than 100 miles, putting the rate of the caravan at 2| miles per hour. For many miles before nearing Bereymi the track, where any exist* passes over undulating downs and dunes of sand which from time to time obscure the view in front but for a long distance before one reaches one’* destination the peak of Jebel Hafeet furnishes a useful guide for direction. P&amp; getting near the outskirts of the oasis and looking «outhwards alone the valley ofth e Uadi Batha one sees a series of sand dunes and hummocks stretching away southwards, apparently in continuation of Hafeet, but in reality they are not, and, as one finds out later, tUy are situated a good deal to the south and west and are not in prolongation of it. Possibly it3 was the sight of tWe dunes as Zweiner appprnached Bereymi from the A.1 u Thabi side that caused him to fall into Wellsted’s error regarding the supposed &lt;f Okdat ^ or u Okabat ^ Range, which, as Miles has lou^ ago pointed out, is purely mythical. Hafeet is one solitary hill rising straight out of tue plain. It is probably 1,500 feet high. By the ward “ Bereymi,” as used in Oman, is understood the whole of the Bereymi oasis, comprising not only the village from which the settlement takes its name, but also the neigh bouring villages of Jimi, Katareh, Hili, Suareh, Ain, Motariz and Yahali. The three last named get their water-supply by means of the usual underground aqueducts from Jebel Hafeet; the remaining villages look to the range to the north for it. Bereymi to Eafeet .—18 miles. I had to wait for three days at Bereymi before I could get fresh camels. Leaving the encampment of my host and guide on the western edge of the oasis, we passed through Motariz \ahali and Ain, tue second of which villages is a recent settlement inaugurated and fostered by Shaikh Zaeed-bin-Khalifeh of Abu Thabi on a tract of ground reclaimed by him at the base of tne of the re-entrants of Jebel Hafeet. It seems to be in a thriving condition, but the date groves have not yet arrived at maturity. Ain was 4 miles from the start. From Ain the track turns southwards and rims parallel to the base of Hafeet, but keeping a little distance away from it in order to avoid the boulders and talus lying close under the bill. The foim of the country here is level stony plain stretching away to the Hajar Range on the west and studded with mimosa bushes and acacias. During the cold weather months shepherds and their families from the Maeem and Awamir tribes wander about the plain with their flocks and tents, returning to their permanent habitations at Ain and Hafeet at the commencement of the date harvest. Hafeet is about 18 miles from Ain o? Bereymi. It consists of three separate but almos 1 . contiguous settlements—(l)-gharrah for Abu Gharrah), (2), Hafeet, (3) Gharbi. They are quite close together and unsep; rable when viewed from a distance and are wrongly shown in Wellsted’s map. Generally speaking they are all included in the parent village “ Hafeet.” A short 2 miles away to the souih is the village of Kabil not to be confounded with the more important town of Kabil, in the Sharkiyeh country. The water at Hafeet is good and abun dant. Eafeet to Dthanh, —45 miles. At first the route leads over the same shingly plain as heretofore, devoid of vegetation or almost so ; but later, as one approaches the wells of Moofiyeh, 7 hours by caravan, the mimosa and acacia vegetation appears again and becomes gradually more plentiful. The village at Moofiyeh is only a nomad one composed of Abu Shamis shepherds and their families housed in blanket or mat wigwams with their flocks of goats. It is difficult to arrive at any reliable estimate of such flocks, but the total cf those scattered over the broad plain lying between Bereymi and Dthank must amount to many thousands. The population of Moofiyeh is about 150. 14 miles more through the same class of country bring the traveller to the Bedouin wells and village of Buzzeili, also belonging t) the Abu Shamis, and coutaining about 2U0 souls. Seneyah, another of their villages, lies about 4 miles to the southwards, across the plain, whiih as far as the eye can reach has plentiful mimosa vegetation, but merges at no great distance into the Ruba-el-Khali. Dthank is 12 miles further on, the country being of the same character and reminding me very much of the “ Haud ” of Somaliland. An hour before Dthank is reached the Wadi Abu Kurba crosses the track, and its s aody bed and banks thickly clad with tamarisks afford a pleasant change to the eye after the monotony of the country traversed since leaving Bereymi. Dthank is an important and prosperous town containing some 4,000 inhabitants and mostly permanent dwellings of sun-dried bricks, and is pleasantly situated at the mouth of the precipitous opening in the Hajar Range formed by the exit of the Wadi Dthank, in which water was trickling above ground at the time I passed. It possesses fine orchards and date groves, and there is a little cultivation on the outskirts of the town, chiefly karbi and loosan grass, for the consumption of their draft bullocks, of which there are about 200 in the towu, employed for irrigation purposes. Hafeet can just be made out when the atmosphere is at its clearest, but this is the last point from which it can be seen. The tract of country between Bereymi and Dthank had not previously been traversed by any European, but Dthank itself was visited in 1885 by Colonel S. B. Miles from the south wards. He arrived there from Obri and made it the turning point of his journey, travelling up the Wadi Dthank and so on via Yenkaland Rostak to Maskat. His route, which is shown, by a green dotted line in the accompanying sketch map, is only conjectural, as he has left no map of his journey. Dthank to Mazum. —14 miles. Erom Dthank the track turns back to the south-east for some miles in order to clear a spur thrown out into the plain from the main range. The pomt of this spur is passed at t&gt;miles, and the trade then turns to the Mt, up a broad re-ent’-ant, where the soil which has hitherto been of the shingly nature so far prevalent becomes more sandy and ascends gradually towards the apex of the valley, where it rises suddenly over the col on the low hill known as Jebel Felaij and drops down into the village of Mazum on the southern side of it. A cluster of hamlets of the Beni Kaab, known as Mamur or the Felaij of the Beni Kaab, is sem and left a couple of miles away to the right. The passage over the col just mentioned is difficult for camels on account of the boulders with which it S strewn, and the descent on the southern side is steep, but all difficulties and obstructions could be moved with very little trouble. Mazum is a strongly walled village, with a somewhat imposing guarded entrance, and is tenanted bv a colony of Baluchis who have resided there for many generations and are allied for offensive and defensive purposes to the Beni Kattab. They have so far mamtamed their distinct Baluoh type of feature but now inter-marry with Arabs. They have practically no communi cation with the Oman Coast, their import and export trade being entirely with Abu Thabi and Debai. Mazum to Obri .—18 to 19 miles. After leaving Mazum the track passes over an undulating wa&lt;te, now stony now sandy, and with sparse vegetation About half-way a cluster of low hills lie away to the south wards and relieve the monotony a little. At 17£ miles the path rises over the neck separating the small hill overlooking Obri from a prominent spur from the mam range and from the crest of it a good view is obtained of the extensive basm below, containing the villages of Ghubbi, Araki, Beit-el-Ainein and Dereez, and stretching for a good many miles to the north eastwards towards the bases of Jebel, Misht and Khewr. The town of Obri itself is buried in an enormous expanse of date groves. Setting aside the Semail vallev the banks of which are lined almost without a break, irom its “ nejd near Mutiv to Finieh, with a wide belt of date gardens. Obri possesses the widest extent of date cultivation that I have met with in any single town of Oman hitherto visited. Tim cluster of mud houses centred round the fort and bazaar are tenanted by the poorer portion of the population : every land-owner, large and small, has his own house and those of his relations dotted about in the shade of the date groves, so that the habitations are very scattered, bruit and grass are plentiful, and there is extensive cultivation both in the date groves and outside in the open. The population cannot be much le=s than 7,000. Indigo-dyeing is the chief industry and the hands and faces of the working population are chronically besmeared with it. Obri has been fully described by Wellsted and Miles. It is to be noted that the positions of Ainein, Glmbbi, Araki, Dereez and Ariz m the existing map (Colonel Ross’s) are altogether wrong. Apparently the points of the compass have been reversed in plotting out. Obri to Khubbara .—22 miles. Starting from the fort of Obri and winding through a labyrinth of orchards, one emerges into the bed of the broad .Wadi, on the bank of which Obri lies, and after crossing it a small tract of higher ground intervenes before one drops again into another dry watercourse, the Wadi Seleyf, which also flows southwards, and effects a junction xvith the Wadi Obri, a little lower down at Debayshi, then flowing onwards past Tennam, the bead-quarters of the Deroo tribe. At the point where one meets it, coming from Obri, the Wadi Seleyf has just emerged from a natural gateway formed by it in forcing its way through an isolated chain of narrow hills about 300 feet high. The village of Seleyf, which is about 2 miles from the fort of Obri, is in two divisions, one on each side of the W adi. It has a small fort perched upon the summit of the eastern bank overlooking the aqueduct on the edge of the Wadi below. Seleyf is practically a suburb of Obri. After leaving Seleyf the road follows the Wadi in the direction of Jebel Khewr, but at 10 miles after circumventing the spur shown in the sketch, turns to the southwards and crosses and recrosses the Wadi Selevf. Finally, it leaves the Wadi bed altogether, and the rest of the way to Kubbara is over fairly level and easy ground. Viewed from Seleyf village. Wadi Seleyf locks as if it ought to rise in the Jebel Khewr, but from the manner in which it breaks away to the south-east before reaching Kubbara, it is evident that such is not the case, and I think it must rise in the low hills just south of Seleyf. The road from Obri to Kubbara offers no difficulties whatever, as the Wadi bed is shingly and free from boulders, and once you quit its bank you are on sandy soil. Kubbara is a very small hamlet of the Beni Gessas, about 50 souls, subject to the Yakoobi element at Obri. At the time I was there the inhabitants were in very straitened circumstances owing to the continued drought. Their felejes were failing and their date trees languishing for want of rain. The village is overshadowed by the lofty Jebel Khewr, the crest of which appears to be about 10 miles away.5 Kublara to Saifam.—khout 27 miles. My caravan took 11 hours. The track at first turns eastward towards Jebel Khewr in order to avoid some broken ground, then it debouches into a broad triangular valley formed by the convergence of the Jebel Khewr with Jebel Hadda. The col joining the two systems at tho apex of the triangle forms the watershed dividing the Dhahireh district from the “ Jauf” of Oman and is known as “ Nejd-ul-Mukharim, “ nejd’' always meaning in Oman “ Lied) ground where the waters divide/’ The route from Obri to Saifam by this pass baa not before been traversed by a European. It offers little difficulty and must be much easier than the pass crossed by Miles at the northern extremity of Jebel Khewr known as the Akabat-el-Berak. Coming fr-^m the Khubbara side one comes abreast of the summit of Jebel Hadda at 7 miles, faomg which on the opposite side of the valley can be seen a deep cleft in the side of Jebel Khewr inm which the Wadi Ain takes its rise. A little beyond the cleit and on the same side lie the villages of Dan and Nadan with their green date groves standing Out in relief against the barren elopes of the mountain. The country passed through between Kubbara and the nejd is sandy plain sprinkled with mimosa scrub and thickly strewn with talus from the mountain. The ascent to the crest of the col is very gradual and offers no difficulty, but the descent, which winds down the rocky bed of a torrent, took us half an hour to negociate and is not easy for laden camels. Mine'were lightly loaded, however, and I had no mishap. From the crest &lt;jf the nejd a g(&gt;od view is obtained of what is known as the ‘‘Jauf' of Oman proper, as opposed to the Dhahireh district which we have just left. The word “ Jauf ' signifies literally “ the hollow interior of anything” and used geographically conveys the meaning of heart,” “basin,” or “crater.” In the present case “badn” seems m&lt; st appropriate, fer as one takes in the view min the pass the tract of country below presents that appearance. The basin is bounded cn the west by the Jebel Khewr, on the north by the Jebel Akhdar range, and on the south by the Jebel Hamra orRed Mountains.” This Jebel Hamra r.mge is very much in evidence from iNejd-eL'IMakbavim, and although, as before mentioned no traveller has used this route before, the range can be easily seen from Gibrin and also from the top of the Jebel Akhdar, and I am therefore surpiised at its not having been mentioned by Wellsted or Miles. Jebtd Hadda, which is connected with Jebel Kbewr by the Nejd-el- Makharim, forms the north-west extremity of the range, and viewed from the pass the range stretches away as far as the eye can reach in an easterly direction inclining to south-east. It seems to be of a diffeient geological formation altogether to that represented, by the Jebel Kbewr and Jebel Akhdar, and is probably red sandstone. During the day-time it looks terra cotta in colour and it is from this circumstance it gets its native name of Jebel Hamra or Red Range ' -^DnT^fcHing the plain below the pass to the track turns sharply to the left and benrs ab ng the base of Khewr to the village of Saifam, lying at an altitude of 1,900 feet. This is a flourishing village of the Beni Shekeyl aod lies on the bank of a Wadi of the same mime in the southern slopes of Khewr. Saifam is overshadowed by one of the principal peaks of Khewr, which must be about 7 000 leetin altitude. The village is only a short distance from the northern pass the “ Akabat-el-Barak,” but the latter is generally approached from the Tanoof direction via the Wadi Ghol. Saifaya to Gibrin and Balia .—and Hi miles respectively. The going is good. The whole of this basin before referred to is thickly studded with small conical hills of igneous rock and must have been at one tune subject to volcanic action. Gibrin, which is reached easily in three hours, is said to have been a place of some import ance in days gone by, and its very spacious and pretentious fort supports this statement; but its glory has long since departed and at present it is simply the private estate and summer resort of the Utoobi Shaikh of Bahia. It consists of the fort before mentioned (now in a very ruined condition), surrounded by somewhat scanty date plantations, a few fields under cultivation, and the dwellings of the small community which works on the estate. From Gibrin Bahia is 4 miles in a north-easterly direction. Bahia is a fine town which has been described by Wellsted and Miles. From Bahia is the road to Tanoof winding in and around the series of sugar-loaf hillocks before referred to. After visiting Bahia I rejoined my party at Gibrin. , Gibrin to Nezwa.—Zo miles. The going is good. At first over undulating ground and winding round the low hills, then at 7 miles Jebel Kameeleh is passed with the village of Teinseh close by on the right; Colonel Miles’ route between Mennah and Bahia is here crossed. At 20 miles the traveller reaches Rhodda and almost contiguous with it, Park, both on tlm Wadi Nezwab. From Rhodda the track follows the course of the Wadi Nezwa and date groves succeed one another on either bank without intermission till Nezwah is reached, about i&gt; miles fnm Rhodda. Nezwah again has been fully described by previous travellers. (Urn6 L Nezioah to faMOc?/*.—About 7 milts. , l J P th* bed d! the Wadi. The going is somewhat tedious and difficult owino- to the bouklers. I he village of Semmed is contiguous with the lim.ts of Nezwah, but its politics are different. It is the village of one of the chief Shaikhs of the Beni Riyam, Hamdan-bin-Saif. He is the brother of Shaikh Him} r ar of Tan oof, but owing to a long-standino* blood feud they are inveterate enemies. As, however, Hamdan has property and some influence among the -Bern Kiyam of the mountains, it is necessary to placate him as well as his brother, and it lequires ore to maintain friendly relations with both. Tail oof has already been described. It is a somewhat uninteresting village situated in a cramped posit wu facing the cleft in the range formed by the exit of the Wadi Tanoof. The village is close up against the cliffs. Transport is very scarce and difficult to procure, the natives seeming to have barely enough for their own requirements and no margin for hire. 1 onkevs of course are the only beasts of burden in oae.between the lebel Akhdar and ttezwah, consequently I had sent on my camel caravan from Nezwah to meet me at Mutiy or Stimail aecodaStbe^u-e ^ 6 m0lUl,aiu * ) aod with difficulty obtained four donkeys wherewith to lanoof to Shereyjeh —21 miles. • • It is advisable to say something here about the spelling of “ Shereyjeh.” It is spelt thus in the existing map, and in my opinn n this is the correct form. Wellsted spells it “ Sherazi ” which does not represent the pronunciation in the least, but was doubtless adopted bv that traveller trom the idea that the name was connected with Shiraz. Colonel Miles, adopting ‘the same theory spells it Sheraizi, which he considers to be a diminutive form of Shiraz I believe they have both gone off the track. At all events the name is spelt by the natives of the place and of Oman generally (vernacular characters Shereyjeh) and is so pronounced by iV‘ r s’hereyoeh 0 ^ 0UDClng ^ JeCm ** * ' G ’ 38 iS the 6otanioa habifc of the Arabs, and calling My belief is supported by the fait that the village under reference is rot the- only one o that name in Oman. 1 here is another Shereyjeh near Seeb, a small coast town north of Maskat, whicti is spelt and pronounced in the s .me way, and the more natural derivation of the name, and one supported by native opinion, is that the word is a diminutive of (vernacular characters Sherjeh), an Arabic word commonly used to mean ‘'a place from which water flows out of rocky ground on to soft ground.” * ' its .r'lamnf 1 ,', 8 ( ver t racul . ar “ ll “ raote r s Shereyjeh) is the regular form of diminutive aud its meaning is true to nature m the present case. The inhabitants of the Jebel Akhdar now-a-days inter-marry habitually with the Beni ■yarn °f the plains and vice versa, and do not admit any origin or interests distinct from t heirs. A descr.pt ion of the route from Tanoof to the crest is given by Wellsted, but I did not nnd it nearly so difficult as it appeared to him, though I must have followed practically the same track. There would be no great difficulty in making the ascent passable for camels, and tor a laden donkey or mule it presents no difficulties. The Watprhole occurring about 4 miles from Tanoof is a large natural reservoir in the rocks, m which the water accumulates. At 16 miles the Wadi Beni Habeeb is reached con taining two contiguous villages of the same name, locally distinguished, as are many settle ments similarly situated, by the names of “ Ain” and “ Akr ” • Saik is U hours walk from Wadi Beni Habeeb and the western section of the Shereyieh settlpment H miles miles further on. As in the case of Beremi and Hafeet the name Sherey- i ., mC udeS ^ !16 l? aren ^ vd l a e&gt; e and a ^ so tbe P a n sbes “Ain” and “Akr” as at Sh- reyjeh, which lies in terraces on the face of the cliff looking down the Wadi Mivadein towards Burnet'el-Moz, has been described by W ellsted and Miles. I made the altitude of the village 6,300 feet. fshereyie i to Mutiy .— Sheveyjeh the path tikes a general direction of 150 and after crossing the Wadi Miakal, in which lies the village of Hail, rises gradually to the eastern crest of the Jebel Akhdar, the sene.al elevation of which is 7,000 feet. Then, keeping for some distance at^about the same level, the tract skirts the conspicuous peak named Khazr, the summit of which must approach 8,0()0 feet. On reaching the southern face of Khazr the path zigzags for some distance down a salient until it reaches a col where there is a small Musjid and resting-place tor travel leis with a well attached. From this point there is a very steep stone staircase dating from the Persian occupation, descending abruptly ‘ipto the Wadi Halfein, some 3 000 Teet below a two hours' tiring descent impassable for anything but men and donkeys, and I should say only donkeys bred to it. J RiyaMutiy lies on the margin of the Wadi Halfein, and is an insignificant village of the Beni Kiyam. B ° For any one undertaking a survey of the Jebel Akhdar this would undoubtedly - be the easiest point to start in from. From the crest near Jebel Khazr, or better still from the sum-7 A mit of that peak, which is apparently an easy one to ne^ociate, a grrand panorama view is obtained to the east and south, showing Zikki, Mannah, Adam, the villages of the A1 Wahibeh and the great adis H ilfem and Andam following their tortuous courses far away to the southwards. After a rest at Shereyjeh and putting in the southern crest the surveyor could then start on the northern crest overlooking Rostak. From these two points, with two or three points m the plains already fixed, a very large extent of country could be filled in. Mutiy to Semail.~—28 miles. Tne route from here into Maskat is well known and receiving letters here which called for my early presence in Maskat to meet H. M. S. Ain.phitfite I rode into Semail durin 0- the night. It was a 7-hours ride, walk and trot, and I calculate the distance to be at 28 to :30 miles. H hours north of Mutiy is the nejd from which the Wadi Halfein and W a d Beni Ruwahah take their rise. The former flowing southwards and afterwards, having joined the Wadi Andam, making its way to the sea near Mahot, latitude 20, longitude 58K., while the Wadi Beni Ruwahah, known later on in its course as the Wadi Semail, flows r*fl Bidbid and Finjeh into the sea at Seeh. I travelled from Semail to Maskat via Finjeh, Bosher and Ghubra, and this part c* the road is too well known to need remark. I made the distance from Semail to Mutra to be 54 miles. Maskat; | P. Z.

At -f of an hour a defile through low foot hills from the main range on the right, is en tered. Low stoney knoll-s lie close to the track, on ei ther hand; there is therefore no view obtainable, at la bours, after pass ing some strangely contorted strata, ex -posed on the sides of the defile, water was reached. This was obtainable by shallow scrapings made by hand, inthe sand; the presence o.f water here, however, was said to be due to recent rain, within the last month oh two, and could not be relied upon. At 2 hours, the hills, on either side have receded and the route lies across a stoney plain, level but intersected by dry watercourses (wadis). The hills to the south are small and un important, the main range being that on the right hand side, i.e. to the N.W. High hills above Sur (part of the Jebel Khadther range) are visible, towering up in the distance towards the westward. There is abundance of good camel grazing here, but no water. At 2J- hours, a small circular depression, or hollow, is reached after crossing a low ,, col M . It is surrounded by low hills, and forms a .kind of natural fort, about 200-'00 yards in diameter, which could be held by a small force, wishing to obstruct this road, with considerable success. At 12 miles a valley is crossed along which the direct road to Sur branches off towards the right. At 14 miles, Ain el Musharifeh is reached. The wells are in a dry wadi bed and are shallow.

Per sonally, I made a detour to the right, i.e. to the westward, to the entrance, to a valley running up into the range of hills in front of us, which bore 248 from our camp at Ain el Musharifeh. At lb hour this point was reached; it is a narrow rugged and rocky little valley at the entrance of fxtx 1 z-xx 3 .±±gy wnich there is a little water, from here our way to rejoin the caravan lay along the foot of the chain of hills, forward bearings taken frequent ly varied between 202 and 225. At I 4 - hours, a deep and wide dry watercourse was crossed, which runs down from the hills on our right to the plain on our left. The volume of water must at times, be very considerable. At 21 hours, a wide view over the desert plain stretching away toI to the south-east, to Ras el Hadd and to the southern coast of Arabia, was obtained from a rocky ridge. At 4 hours, the caravan was overtaken, about 1 -J- miles east of the rocky gorge, through which we were to continue our march. The name of this gorge is given as 'Mithnatain' which, however, merely means 'two peaks' and appears to be a generic name for any defile of this nature. This point is at 13 miles. About 4^- miles east of the entrance to this defile on the caravan road, there is a well, with a few trees. After entering the valley which runs up with an approximate general bearing of 350. It is from 400 to 800 yards wide between the feet of the hills on either side. The actual watercourse is from 40 to 200 yards wide, and in many places runs between perpendicular banks 20 or 30 feet high. Many tributary watercourses run down fr from the hills on both sides. About a couple of miles from the entrance to this valley, a water hole is reached, the water though strongly impregnated with salt, is good for camels, and was drunk by the Arabs. At 16 miles the camping placeplace reached. It is about a quarter of a mile N. U. of the main watercourse, up one of the small tributary wadis already mentioned. The site of the camp is 1740 feet above sea level, close under the rugged and almost precipitous crapgs of limestone and shale. Running water is ob tained from a shallow hole among the rochs, a few hundred yards further up this small tributary wadi, and though there is consi derable salt efflorescence, it is potable and was sufficient for our considerable caravan, during the week we were encamped there. There is an old cemented tank and water channels still existent, but disused since the tribe migra ted to Rufsheh, some years ago; this migration was not because of any la.ck of water. There are three or four surface exposures of coal in the close vicinity of the camp. Route Imo: i Krom Muswa To Sur, via Wadi Ralej. Authority and date. Captain H. H. Dowding. 1^01.

At 1 hour and 10 minutes, a Wadi is passed running up to the W. N. W. up which is a coal exposure but of small size onl 3 r . At 1 hour and 20 minutes, the top of the Muswa valley is reached, 600 feet above the level of our late camp. i : rom this point there is a fine view both wa 3 r s; looking back towards the south over the valley up which we have just marched and the desert bey ond stretching to the coast, and looking forward towards the N. N. W. down the valley into which we are about to descend, and over the wide Wadi I'alej to the towering mass of the Jebel Akthdar on its far side. Hhre the path is rugged and winding and the pace slow* At 1J- hours, bisao is reached, and camp is pitched close to the main water course, and immediately opposite the entrance to the torrent bed in which the princi pal coal' exposure that examined by Mr. von Krafft six months ago. This tributary wadi is specially rugged with precipitous and over hangingoverhanging cliffs, with here and there great elbows hollowed out of the bed roclc and smoothed by water action. There is water close to the cajnp but brackish and unpalatable. In a tributary watercourse among the hills on the right (N.

In this same watercourse is a bedouin encampment: 70 or 80 sheep and goats, 2 cows, and some poultry were seen. Water is ob tainable close below the sufface of the stream-bed.

Leaving iisao, the track follows the main water course down the Wadi, only occasionally quitting the dry bed of the stream to cross some low silient, ra ther than follow the course of the stream round it. At 40 minutes auid also at 1 hour, water holes are passed. At 1 hour 40 minutes, the road debouches from the Wadi fisao into the main valley, Falej. Two or three tributary stream beds, running down from the Jebel Khamis range, about 2 miles away to our right, are crossed, and at 2 hours 50 minutes the small village Ohasa (of the Musharifeh tribe) is eeen on the right, nestling among the foot hills of Jebel Khamis which towers above it. At 3 hrs. 10 min. the road descends into the bed of the main watercourse- € watercourse of the Wadi Falej, large pools of water with date plantations are passed and at 3 hrs. 40 min. the site of our camp is reached. There is no vil lage here, but it is an oasis in the bed of the stream, a more or less permanent encampment of Bedouin. T ''ate palms, oleanders and other trees extend for about a mile;water is ample and good; there is also good camel grazing. There are evidences of former cultivation, irrigation etc, having been carried on; now aban doned probably owing to the scar city and cost of slave labor. This Wadi Falej is an import ant valley, running up from Sur in a generally southwesterly direction, and forms the main channel of communication between that port and the interior. It varies greatly in width; from a few hundreds of yards at Rufsheh to between 2 and 3 miles further up. The general level of the valley is broken by tributary wadis from the hills on either side; the main watercourse averages some 2Q0to 300 yards, between banks 20 to 30 feet in height. Leaving the Falej oasis, the route follows the main watercourse in which, h&amp;ff an hour after the start.start, running water is seen* i^'rom this point onward, the run ning stream has constantly to be forded, sometimes between high and cliff-like banks. At 2 hours Rufsheh tower is reached after a sjseep zig-zag climb up from the bed of the stream, in order to pass through the narrow gate. This is the frontier post of the .Musharifeh tribe, who are allowed to levy toll from caravans as a condition for not looting them. The posi tion of this post for the latter purpose is excellent the water course being at this point very narrow it would be impossible for any caravan to attempt to pass without the consent of any force posted here. The post consists of a circular stone tower pierced with loopholes, about 50 feet high and 50 feet in diametre, which stands some 100 yards away from a sqaure gate iiouse, through which all caravans must wind their way. In the face of the cliffs of kh the river bed, immediately op posite this post, are seen some very primitive cave dwellings, containing apparently some eight or ten families. At 2J hours, the mouth of a tri butary valley conspicuous by its brilliantbrilliant sandstone cliffs, is passed on the left. Up this val ley lies the village Misluk, about one nour’s march. At 3J- hours, the road bebouches from the Wadi balej into the open level ground which lies between the coast range and the sea, on the further side of toich is Suk Sur. At hours Suk Sur is reached. It is flourishing place with e::- tensive cultivation, chiefly of date palms and lieerne grass. All supplies as well as water, for the port Sur are obtained from this place. The population is estimated at about ?00 men. There are 95 wells, 150 ca,ttle, 150 donkeys, here. There are no camels locally available, these are obtained from neighbouring tribes. There is another small village about a mile off towards the N. W. called Ohena (or Ghina) with an old fort. The seaport Sur lies nearly 3 miles further on to the N. E. the road passing over shingley flats which extend between the Khor (or backwater) and Suk Sur and to the west of the Khor. At low water, however, it is possible to shorten this road slightly by going more direct, over the xix&amp;a: dried mud flats. Sur lies on a low sandy shore entirelyentirely destitute of trees or vegetation of any kind. There are two villages to the westward Shegi and Seneisla, each of which contain about 80 or 100 houses.

Hail. v Kuryat al Sagheir of the map, known to the natives as Bagh- mar, is the most southerly of a group of villages which ex tend along the coast line, ab out six miles long, of a wide delta-shaped valley. The whole of this gruup of five villa ges seems to be known by tne general name of 'Oaghmar', while each hamlet has, in addition, a distinct name of its own. These commencing from the southern end, are:- ^ Kuryat Sagheir (or 'little Kuryat'), Chenneh, Bi11ad, Sullan, Ruiz and Kuryat (sometimes called Kuryat al Kab ir, or 'Big Kuryat'). ThisThis latter place lies ^ miles south of Ras Abu Daud, close under the hills, and is almost hidden in a date grove. One of the watercourses running doivn the main valley rounds the north end of the grove, and forms a small creek. Kuryat al Sagheir, at the op posite (southern) end of this line of hamlets, lies near a low sandy point, miles S. It by S. of Ra,s Abu 'Haud. A small white fort stands on a mound close to the village, which contains about 59-60 houses, and some 250 inha bitants r whose occupation is xx fishing, twenty or thirty fishing- boats are owned. This may be taken as a type of the other hamlets with exception, perhaps, of Kuryat itself which, as its subriquet shows, is larger. The population of the whole group of villages has been estimated at about 5000 souls, of the Beni Sinan and other tribes mixed. Supplies are cattle, fowls, fruit, vegetables and water are obtain able: this district supplies the Muscat market. The water supply is good and sufficient, from wells 15-20 feet deep. The valley, or as it might almost be termed the plain, is bounded on either side of it by rugged and steep lime stoneT K a limestone hills with a line of low-lying stonyy knolls down the centre of it. On one of these, is . a small ruined tower, intended and supposed to protect the Dagmacr group of villages, with their date groves, from attack coming from the land side. Leaving our camp, which was about one mile inland, from Kuryat al Sagheir, the route at J- an hour turns sharply to the left, quit ting the main valley and entering the hills which bound it on its southern side. The road now fol lows the Wadi Hail, in ts tor tuous course between perpendicu lar cliffs, ?00 or 400 feet high whihh shut out all view of the surrounding country. The bed of the watercourse is shingle and sand, level and firm. At 2-J- hours Hail is reached. A flourishing little place of 80 or 100 houses, situated at a bend of the Wadi, where it widens out very considerably. There is ex tensive cultivation and date orchards. The full name of this little place 'Hail el Ghaf' allud es to the fact that prior to its growth into a village the site ?ras merely a patch of ground covered with a thicket of acacia trees (Uhaf.) The date orchards are very regularly laid out, witha wide avenue running up the centre, in rectangular plots. The water supply never fails, being brought by a 'falej' from the hills to the northward. The main road to Kuryat the larger branches off up the main avenue, over the Y/atershed into the prin cipal valley, and thence in a north-easterly direction. There is also a short cut, fit for foot traffic and donkeys only, over the hills to the north-east to Dagmar (whence we have just come) Yrhich is said to be only one hours march by this path. The population is said to be 200 'men' of mixed Axxkx.tribes. i’r^om Hail, the route up the Wadi continues to be of the same character as during the last stage; with the same perpendicular cliffs on both sides* though scarcely so tortuous or vrinding. The 'going' too is somewhat rough er, here and there over boulders. The 'falej' which supplies Hail- with its perennial water runs along this wadi. A new one is be ing strueted to take the place of the existing one, damaged by floods. An old masonry 'falej' is seen, built on the rugged face of the cliff. At 2 hours the stream is first met with above ground, flowing briskly; fromf¥om 'this Joint; it has frequently to be crossed and re-crossed, till the end of the march. At 3J- hours, Mudthara is reached. This is a charming and most picturesque village, at the foot of a lofty range, and com passed about on all sides by steep hills. An old ruined tower and part of the village stands on a crag looking down the stream and commanding the defile up which we marched from Hail. It is a large and prosperous looking plane, with extensive cultivation and date orchards on both sides of the main stream, and of two tributaries which join it close by. It is the chief settlement of the powerful Beni Batash tribe, and the place of residence of the 'Temina', or paramount chief. Population: 200 'men' or 600 inhabitants. There are said to be ^00 donkeys, 100 head of cattle, but no camels here. Besides dates, a kind of millet is largely grown from which bread is made. Leaving Mudthareh, it is some time before the outlying cultivation, and water channels which supply the village with its very ample irrigation, are left behind. The road, as usual, follows© follows the streajn up the narrow ing valley. At If- hours, a narrow gorge cutting through the mountain mass of Jebel al- Beidheh, or Biath i from here on the stream, or road, for they are synonomous terms, is shut in on loth sides by lofty precipitjtfous and in places, overhanging cliffs. The width of the river bed from cliff to cliff averages perhaps 100 yards though in places It is much less. The huge walls of rock give one the impression that the mountain range must have been split in twain, from base to summit by some wonderful convul sion of nature. These cliffs tower up to an altitude of 1000 to 1500 feet, sheer from the level of the stream. At hours, it is necessary to dismount for 10 or 15 minutes as the track is too bad for camels to be ridden over it. At 5J hours, it is necessary to dismount again and the camels are unloaded and passed by hand round by a difficult track in the face of the cliff, while their loads are hauled up by hand and rope, over a steep boulder and carried for a distance of 200 yards. The obstance is formed by a mass of huge blocks of rock havinghaving fallen from the face of the cliff. This slip occurred according to an ancient inhabitant when the rulers of Oman ceased to bear the title of Imam. It could easily be cleared with a small expenditure of gun-cotton; but it is likely to be cherished in the future as in the past, as a source of income to the local inhabitants. The passage of this 200 yards occupied exactly one hour. Ten minuted later some of the palm gardens of Tul a suburb of Ghobreh are seen beyond the exit from the gorge, and at 7J- hours h the camping-place at Ghobreh is reached. Ghobreh lies at the S.U. end of the Wadi Tyin about half a mile from the mouth of the defile just mentioned the Wadi Theika. A tributary stream joins thw main stream of the Wadi Tyin, \ from the S. S. LI. This tributary is dry on the surface, but water is obtainable in shallow wells any by 'falej'. Up this valley lies Semai about 7 hours march; and Khubbeh about half tnat dis tance. On the road to Semai is a village called Walseh, said to be about 3 miles from Ohobreh, containing 100 'men'. Semai is on the water-parting between the Wadi Tyin basin and the country ofof the Beni Jabr, to which tribe it belongs. From Semai, there is said to be a good road to the Hejriyin country, and to. the Jailan district via 'Oabik, Mudtheyyrib, and Bediyeh. Crhobreh is inhabited by mixed tribes, and is said to contain 200 'men' and 60 donkeys. during the march up the wide and important Wadi fyin one of the largest and most populous valleys in Oman, perimps the firstand most lasting impression is the remarkable and conspicuous contrast that the Arab names meaning 'White' and 'Black' mountains hardly seem to exaggerate it. The northern range is known by the name of Jebel Beidheh, or Biath (meaning'white mountain'). It appears to be mainly composed of limestone in horizontal- stratification, with rounded rolling slopes and somewnat like a table land at the top. Its average altitude is estimated at approximately 6000 feet. Arid and sterile as these hillshills look, they are raid to be inhabited by a considerable popu lation of shppherds who rear large flocks. The Southern range is known by the names of Jebel Hallowi or Jebel Saudeh and has the appear ance of a succession of range after range of igneous rock, tier upon tier, with rugged ragged peaks, with none of very great altitude; the average being, perhaps some 2000 feet. It is said to extend tod to be of the same character without any impor tant valleys as far as Bediyeh, (some 40 miles to the southward). On its southern flank it throws out several large shallow water courses, which flow to the sea south of Ras al Hadd. This range marks the north-eastern boundary of the Sha^yeh country. Leaving Ohobreh, marching up the Wadi Tyin at 1 hour the village Lashkar is passed on the right; it contains 50 men of the Beni Batash tribe. At 1J- hours Towi is passed, also on the right a village of the same tribe, and size. At 2 hours, Biath a quaint picturesque village built on the side of a knoll with a tower on the top is seen a short distance to the right. This belongs to the Sowalik(g) Sowalik 'tribe, a branch of the Rahabiyin. At 2|- hours is Rikakyieh, a village of the Beni Umr, a section of the Beni Batash. At 3 hours Sidafi a vil lage of the same tribe is reached. Here the Wadi 'Oimmeh runs into the Wadi Tyin from the left (i. e. from the S.W. ) About I 1 of a mile up this tributary wadi, Bimmeh lies to the village Ahla* At 3 hours 40 minutes is Ghaiyan. The three villages last mentioned all belong to the Beni Umr, and draw th eir water supply from falejes from the Wadi T)iimiieh. At 4 hours a village called Ajma is passed on the right. At 6 hours Akda is reached. It had been intended to halt here, but the inhabitants turned out en masse and de clined to permit us to do so. It was only after a prolonged and very noisy negotiations, backed, on the natives' part with angry gesticulations of ancient matchlocks, and in some cases lighted matches, that we were at last allowed to pass to the next village, Akda, which was reached atat §-§- hours# Ak:da and Ahda are both vil lages of the sajne tribe i. e. the Beni Umr branch of the Beni Batash t -of which Ahda is the chief village and head quarters, lying less than a mile away# This is not the first time that the villagers of AMa have shewn themselves inhospitable, and the occur rence has been mentioned here as it appears a fair sample of the liberty of action as sumed by peteIans and village even in direct opposition to their own chiefs. Adha is a large village con taining 500 ,, men ,r # 'Donkey breeding is carried on here and there are said to be looo donkeys available# Leaving Ahda, still continu ing to march up the valley, AtJ- an hour, Khar is passed on the right. This is the first village of the Beni Araba tribe. i of an hour, later the ruins of a village which had been carried away by a flood,are passed on the left. At 1 hour* Hammam, a village havinghaving a natural wann. r&gt;pi*ing is left about a mile to the right (i.e. to the N.it) and ten minutes latter, Sibil with its extensive .date plantation is reached. In the Omani dia -lect the name of this place (Sibil or Sibal) means an ape and it was the name of a famous ima,ge worshipped by the Arabs in pagans times, before Islam. It is possible that in ancient days a tem ple dedicated to that image, stood here. Sibal is 1500 feet above sea level, and 5oo feet above Ghobreh* It is about 13 miles from A1 Wasit, and about the same distance from Ghobreh. —/^V&lt; THE POLITICAL H.M.S.‘’Perseus' at Muscat, 26th.
