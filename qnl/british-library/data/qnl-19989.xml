He deals with cases of all tynes in which the Subjects of His Highness the Sultan of ..uscat are alone ooncerened.o. concerned, According- to the provisions of the *1.013cat Order in Council 1915* which is nlso applicable to G^radur as vrell, the Wali has the sole right of dealing with the cases of all Persians, Arabs and other nationals of non-Christian Powers not represented 'by their Consul at Gwadur.

Under the Wali there is also a Panchnyat consistint ; of his ■ Confidential Assistant Suleiman ♦tTbaid and a party of respectable ♦ Kohdas* ^iich exercise functions of an advisory and consultative nature in respect of complex cases. Very xt. seldom a case decided by ^ali f oes up to the . uscat Council of ministers as an appeal. The name of the present Wali is * Ali bin H?unud an Arab :of Batinah Coast but born of BaLochi mother. He is about 4? years of age anl took charge of his present office on about lsi): September l^^'^fter having been relieved of his duties of Waliship at Saham on ^itinah Coast, Unlike his predecessor Saif bin -Badar he is a nopular and learned man.

In matters of disputes arising between Kakhudaa xki ?- and their * Janshus* ahout fish catching etc where technic knowledge of Customary Laws on the 'basis of well tried lines of the past is required, the British ent is advised 'by -another annroved Court called •Sal if oh Daryai* ^hich exercise their functions on the analogy of •Salif-'iitul Ghaus' Court of Bal-jrain to ^hich pearl or divini cases are referred for settlement. Half of the memhers of such a Court ire British Indians, ^11 e the other half Sultan Subjects. Quarrels on marriage aM divorce and other religious matters are often referred to the local Qadhi and then confirmed to the consent of the parties concerned. In Eiany instances the parties concerned arrage A ' a compromise out of the Court. The nearest regular Court within whose jurisdic tion Gwadur lies, is that of Political Afent and f Consul, Muscat, 'but vey few cases of Cwidur to up there. A Lajority of Gwadur people prefer to abide 'ty compromise arranged at British Agency^to their lodg ing star ped suits or complaints to the aforesaid Court. c\sa8 dihing .iwi uin,:?. The number of cases compromised and settled at the British Agency to the satisfaction of the parties concerned, during the year under report is 171, out of '-hich 72 cases ar@ in which 'both the parties are either British or British Protected Persons, whereas the remaining 9R represent the Joint Court Cises hotween British and Sultan Subjects, Out of these 54 are such in ^hich Plaintiffs are British Subjects and Defendants the Sultan Subjects, whereas 44 are such in rhich Plaintiffs arenre Sultan Subjects ^nl defendants the British Subjects. The nurter of Criminal Cases was tTvv&lt;c , tut all these ^ere no more than -oetty quarrels amenable to lospxas compromise. They ^ere therefore dismissed w ith warning, after due reference to the local. P ^nchayat or Qadhi whichsoever was suited to the occasion.

Similarly the systei of night matching or sentries does not exist. Occasional instances of theft or buffclary take place, but owing to the . lack of any organisation, nothing effectual is naturally done in such inntancea. The only support on ''hicb ^ali can count J in time of emergency is a limited number of his armed Fidawis or Kohdas ''ho rally to his call.

From their point of view it is necessary that landing arrangements between 3hi:&gt;s and Customs should be in the hands of a contractor working under their orders, for if all Gwadur merchants -'ere allowed to make their own re elective arrangements, there would surely have been a greater possibility of evasion of Customs to the financial loss of the State. , On the basis of the above, the director- C-neral of .Muscat Customs, therefore, granted the contract of •Tending Charges* to Messrs Cursetji, Jamshedji and Hoodbhoy, ) 1 the B.I.S.N.

Shortly after the officiallb* amiourcei ^nt of thfs Contract, the C r adur merchants were ratur^lly th^ enffprers continued raising hue and 'by ir vain representing the matter to the )»P.C. and the Political Agent, •uscat^ t ill on the 6th January 19P8 they received a direct reply from the political ^ ont, Muscat to the effect that Muscat State 'before giving the Contract to the ^resent B .I .S.M. Coy's %ant had asked some of the loading merchants of Gwadur if any of ther tere billing to have it, hut none carae fom'ar!, evidently th# ahove seems to have he n cased on the information convoyed to the Political A* ent, Muscat, 'by the muscat State or 'better still 'by the Director- general of Sultania Customs, ^hile the fact as secretly imnarted to the British Agont 'by the Gradur merchants of standing is that 'Director-General of Sultanis Customs did not endeavour to notify the contract or to invite the applications of Contract in any systematic uray ~?hich ?n«qr of course was to invite the applications through seme British Representative say Political Af-ent, : use at or -iho is in Political Charge of the ''hoie of -^ekran Coast or lastly the British Atfsrt, Gwadur who is the directly responsible official at C-adur or at least to get the contract notified 'by the Public Crier as usually done on the like occasions or 'by bitten poster or notices to stuck on to 5 m ^alls. Since neither of the above t'^o plans seei to have heen executed in actual practice, the official view must naturally support the allegation of the loading merchants that the contract in cuestion was a secret 'bargain 'bet^^en the )irector-General of Sultania Customs, uscat and the aforesaid 1,1.3.K.Coy's Agents 'rho evidently avail themselves of the double rates 'of ' Landing Charges* to the financial rnin of the ( wadur merchants. official and the la{ al viens of the ouestion fe that ;.uscat State cannot at present alter the orasent double rates of 'Landing Charges* without causing a breach of contract with Under the circumstances net forth above, the the B .I .S.l .Coy*s Agents.

(?) The second ^n' hy far the most important grievance of G^adur merchants is about the recent stoppage of transhipment to an^ fro® the neighbouring minor norts of Qnm, Jiwni anl G-mttur. kccorMmto the authentic records and Commercial Treaty of 1^91, 'botnreea the ^ritish Government and His Highness the Sultan of liuscat the transhipment in question is to 'be allowed free of any duty. The Owadur taerchnnts, accordingly, enjoyed this concession ever since the time of their advent into this country till middle of 1927 ^iien luscat Customs Depirtraent. ordered the stoppage of this transhi rient. From the perusal of letter No. 1^3/19-A,, d^ted the ^Oth July 19? 7^ troia t:iO l i/nncial minister of ..uscat State an' 5 addressed to the Political Agent, Muscat '(coir of Miich wan received through I.P.C. hy the British ■V* ent, epwadur), it would ar^ear that the ahove order was 'based on fne fo:.-Tailas stated below within brackets: a ( 1. Tiiat most of the fish transhiened was either from canss and Jl' r ni -'hich ere ports of liritish iiekran or from Gwattur e nelghhourinr Persian Port and furthermore as t-^o leading merchants of ^-/xadur had taken the Customs Contract of the aforesaid two Jekran Ports in their own hands in 19P7, they usually transhipped their own fish from the ahove two r-orts and the practice naturally resulted in the evasion and consequent loss of Uultania Customs# Hence the free transhipment was stopped. ?. That if there had lean proper Customs Officials at Jiwni anl tan^ etc., with a view to acknowledge landings and ??hip ings of transhi '-ed cargo, the transhipment w ou3 have 'bean allowed free of luty but as the present Custoi Officials »t and Jiwni were Gwadur contractors who also acted as trarshij o«rs of fish of their o-«n an.I also of their kinsmen, the free transhipment was therefore stopped.) _ ct Quotation ro, 1 ahove was further substanfiatec in the above letter ty the Quotations of actual Customsw @ i Customs f uren rhowlni: thp &gt; inore-so of tr ^nghlpment (*rf ; o of fi-h frnn the y onr 19P^ 1 to 19T?, ritiowlng theroby ihnt the (;md^r rn&amp;torm Contractors of Gnm an-l Jiwii t^rmpht their o^ti is '-on na of tl air relatives* c^r^o to t^drr for th^ rnirpos® of tr ^r, 'i^nent, The f net f however, is ■tlmt ttiadur rorchmtr, unfit? rtook the customs Contract of (i»am nnd Jinni J'orts not oRly in 19f 7 ^titel in tho above letter 'but nlso for n ^orlod if il)out rs yanrs previous to that. In other -ords it is their sols o- 1: for the reason that owini to their cieot ra-pihical situation, these two ports of tinz and Jiraii have little or no i ekran interest ml have no ' easy connections ^ith the ^inland of -^-ekran, hence no r ekran rerchant has 'ver co'ae forward to uridertaks the Customs Contract in question. Home years 'co the Customs even C^adur itself ^as in the hinds of C w adur merchants -tio entered into contracts rrith the meat State. Iho itove difficulty would have 'been soon ohviated, If ■ rltlsh Mfekran Authorities hal a^ reed to or hid 'been moved to appoint their paid 3tate Official' at Canr: and Jiwnl instead of l iving the Customs Contracts of these two ports to ( ^adur merchants ♦iio are now in trouble on account of their entering, in' o contracts ^rith the British .nlmn \uthoritlee.

It has 'been mentioned in details shove that the importance of Gwadur as a port of transhipment and distributing centre to the mainland of J'.ekran and the nei{:h'bourin£! Persian Balochistan has consMerahly decreased o^inr to tlie stoppage of Transhipment and double contractual Landing Charges* To th.e ahove t-^o ohstacles may now he added the third one which owes its growth to ti e developement of the mainland, of I elcran Btate and the oponirc up of the minor Coast ports to direct rtoamship service ^ith India. The Geofraphical position of Cwadur is19. is another thing that stands in its 'ray of retaining any lonft the control of the inland trade which was mostly -dth the neighbouring Persian Balochistan in former days. It may 'be recalled that for the people of Persia Balochistan, there are only three gateways and only three, through which they have normally to pass through 'before their entry into Gwadur territiry. These gateways deraark the 'boundarj crtc/vv line of Cwadur hinterland and^towards Kekran, itoich the people of Persian Balochistan have to traverse at any rate, 'before reaching Gwadur# The names of these three gateways in order of their importance are (1) Suntsar, (2) Qalatu , and (S) GaM. The new Customs Regulations of the i^ekran ntate providC-that if these Persian Balochistanis, ^io often visited Gwadur in the past, for exchanging their wool and ghee for the requisite commodities for instance cloth and rice etc* intend to go to Gwadur, after their entering into ..ekran State, the Customs duty may 'be levied on them and that no duty should 1 Tae leviable on them in case they via Persian Balochistanis should chose to go to the interior of Lakran for the exchange of their commodities. Again, according to the wekran Customs Regulations, no duty is charged on sutth Persian Balochistanis if they directly return to their country after their exchanging their goods, whereas duty is chargeable on them in case they should prefer to go to Persian Balochistan via Gwadur. This is why people of Persian Balochistan prefer Mekran for 'business purposes to Gwadur to the traders of ^hich most of them are indebted since long as a result of their previous transactions. In other ^ords the i^ekran Authorities have afforded them a golden chance of avoiding their long standing debts as well. Gwadur is the centre of the important fish industry in the Persian Gulf and since their produce and sale are the chief controlling factors in the general trade ofof Gwadur, the fish trade has, therefore, teen dealt with under a separate heading. Chief articles of export are wool, &amp;hee, cotton, palm tree leaves, mats, hiden and dates ^hich c^nerally come from the interior, while th® main articles of import are cloth rice, flour, foodstuffs, pulses, piece goods, net threads, crockery and other luxuries articles. Most of the ghee, dates, firewood and foodstuffs 'brought from Hekran and Persian Balochistan is consumed tocnlly Tool, Ghee and cotton are generally 'brought to Gwadur only if they are surplus to the needs of the interior people, otherwise these things are also imported from India# miring the year und^r report the articles 'brought from the interior for local consumption 'rere proportionately less in quantity when compared with those 'brought during the last year, this may 'be due to the several reasons vi^;• (1) Owing to the locusts, the crops of the interior were devasted. (S) idany of the articles were not surplus to the local needs of the peopl* of interior* There was also a petty famine in the interior. (3) Vexed with the never ceasing inter-feuds of their Chiefs, most of the Persian Balochistan people left their homes and crons and proceeded to Karachi to settle themselves there permanently. The reasons ~hy the people of interior go to Pasni an! not to Gwadur for 'business purposes, may 'be sur med up as follows (1) They can purchase the articles at i 'asni at a comparatively cheaper rates, as Pasni Customs duty is @ 3^, while Sultania Customs duty at Gwadur is ad valorem. (?) In the case of their coming to Gwadur for purchasing things, thn people of Persian Balochistan.have to pay customs duty at the gateways of laekran mentioned -i'bove, before their entry into Gwadur territory. TXiring the year under report there has lie en21. hns 1)0911 no remnrk-^le change in the rates of articles of trade. Ghee of course has 'been a 'bit dearer. The trade or importation of arms and ai munition is subject to the consent of the British Government, '\cc0rdin4 to the recent rumours some Balochis smuggle arms from Muscat and then take them to Persian Balochist^; 'but the accuracy of this information is doubtful at this stage. FISH m\'H. Fish catching and fish preserving are by far the most important industries at Gwadur which yield the bulk of China and Colombo's supply. About fifty thousands of fish packets were exported during the year under report* In Gwadur there are over 600 boats of various 3i7.es kno^m as Kachans, Batel and aklars (hooris) engaged for fish catching. The men *!ho catch the fish are cabled • Janshus* ^ile their headman is often termed as • Kakhuda*. The Nni-hudas or Janshus make special arrangements ^ith the o-Tiers of the boats. There is a special 'alifa T )aryai Court to advise the Authorities on matters of various disputes arising among the owners of the boats, Jiakhudas and their Janshus, % Prowns are also found in profuse abundance near Gwadur and Sur ports. Fish as also prowns form the principal food of a large class of local people throughout the year both In the fresh and preserved state and in the latter condition are exported in great quantities. In addition to this a large number of fish maws, £d fins and fish manure are exported to Europe particularly to London, Japan, China and. Colombo etc. For the last three years continously, the number of fish has greatly decreased, rmring the year under report, it in renorted to be oven less than the last year. The scarcity of fish has naturally resulted in the poverty of both the fishermen and fish merchants. Normally there are four foilowing fishing seasons in a year as show.; below:* 1, GA.' j OAN SEASON, which prevails from )ecer:ber to ainoat mrany. During this8£. ' (g) lurin£ thie season the 'best kind of fisn knowi as 'Kurfish* is foiml. ?• IRA.T (SUMMIilB), prevalent from i.arch to i ay. 3, iiKHIRI i^iich prevails from Jime to A.u{ ust, 4.

The following: is the list of some important kinds of fish found in Crradur;- Bulando, Kanetar, Pishi, Kahil, Warok, Sidh, Gadi, Garo, l esh, Lohan, Narmani, Kal|ari, Gnlhat and Qanati etc. CU3T0.L3, FIKA.1^ M 1 BXIA )lAIi,.

Import duty is @ ad vo] arem, 'but in the case of fish caught at Gwadur or at sow© subsidiary minor ports of Our and Pishkan, the Janshus or their Kakhudas are required to ^ive one out of ten fishes in kind as a tax on import duty. Bowetises the fish ia valued 'by the experts # and the duty recovered in cash according to the then market value of the fish, there is no export duty. According ' to the Commercial treaty between the British GoverDirent and His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, the imports for i- ro-export py the importers -ithii! six months are not snftgec 1 to any customs duty, 'but quite recently in about November 19r?, transhipment to and from (''iftur G n^ and Ji^ni etc., was stopped by the i useat Customs department. This unexpected step was followed by nurero s representations t*hich are still und^r contemplation of the State. Details about imports anl exports have been cited isx sore^iere else in this report# Tool, fchee, cotton that come the interior for local consumption are not charted any duty 'but fe.rains, firewood, charcoal, dates, talw tree leaves and mattings etc., are charted the proper import duties. The -system in Owadirr is that all articles brought from the interior are first placed in the local Customs Yard called 'Arsah* locally. 4fter the necessary import duty is recovered, the articles are put to public auction and the highest bidder has to pay -/1/- over and above of the purchase roney, irrespective of the weight anr! v-^lue of the auctioned article.

C for the perusal of the - -4- Hon'hle the Political Resident.in the Persian Gulf. It is hoped that the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, in Political Charge, Mekran Coast, Karachi to whom the above mentioned letters have Been addressed will express his view to him in due coutse of time. Letters Bos: 201 and 201, dated the 24th April/llth May 1929 and 25 X.T and D.T. telegrams issued to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, in Political Charge, Mekran Coast, Karachi communications issued from his office, to the Secretary to the Hon'bl the Political Resident !his sons arrcashed \7riting sinilar petitions against ;adhi' DK.fi uhanr iad# It was again '^'bdur llasul the cld.-st son of Kohda Mirom who orrjanised, infuriated and led the riotor to the VVJLi ♦s house in the afternoon of the riot day to protest against the plastering of the mosque with hmaaa dung, .J.though Vali did not 'betake himself to inspect the mosque at all or send a timely word to me or to take effective measures to ensure the dispersal of the riotors yet everybody is satisfied here that Police-less as he then was or is, lie tried his 'best to quiten the people and advised them to go hack to their homes and promised them to do justice after consulting with me. He'sent me a word but alass the mescen^er l I oiig with all Ilolidas reached me after the outrage had 'been committee and I load not the least knowledge of it - it 'being Sunday on the first riot day I was at my 'be owing to my sore eyes. Tbere are reasons to 'believe that ■Ahdur Hasul who was then at the head of all the riotors could easily control the moh when they dispersed at the command of ali, hut alass ho is allejed to stir up the passions of the infuriated and impatient men instead of quieten ing the In fact Kohda Uahraia or his 'brother Kohdas ha' no 'business to come over to me on the evening of the riot day, alonj with the messenger of \7ali. Tkioy said that they oamo to advise is to inspect the mosque which •.ali did not choose to, inspect. Evidently this was not my concern.Sie fact, however, is that they were puzisled over the outrage that had 'boon committed before their arrival but they tried to conceal the same from me. 'vgain had they 'been sincere at heart, they would have preferred to remain at the heads of the ir men who were got ey.cited and infuriated 'by the ahettors, so as to check the possibility of an outrage.

IJl ] IIQ3C r ^CETAUT AirLI^ICATiaU 13 ' QL f' --'llpl- TTTfrl^-'V iiiUiin. 32x122; 2.2 222^' To begin with it may frankly 'be stated that neither this Agency has any personal grudge against the ol&lt;: 'iative assistant, nor has he any such complaint against this Agency or my llunshi against v-hom he has started the .propaganda work. i ifow the natural question is why he intrigues and creates all those troubles. Just as he did create in my pre-' ecessor*3 time,, as 'Juliammad Sian the son of the late r:aja Li-.l Ilian and some well wishers of thi j .agency informed me on xoy arrival here. Sie answer is a simple one and it is that the old Hative Assistant wanted to kill two birds with a stone by creating those troubles vii: a) To take revenge from the enemies of his 'dr llasr t Gul by entangling them in trouble and thus clearing the ground in his estimation, llie enemies of his r, i • are and are Ilohda •Abdullah Allah Balaish and ac?hi. Against the latter he got annanynoas lottei's . .ritton : nd against the former he scat forged a false letter in his name Laid sent the same to the big est authority in the Gulf, so as to entrap him in trouble. (u) To get his own son ^tew^iuliah employed as a llmshi of this Agency, It was to secure this endend tiiat he contrived a propaganda aeainst him 'by instructing his son ia^jaullaii the candidate, to i/rite false petitions against t o : unshi to t ' ITaib azir A * Zt'ifi§ I ekran Jtate, Turbat 9 Director, Persian Gulf, and I eaidency, Bushire under the forced signature of ISunslii iMiaoBTiad Ya'qub himself, Gvadur merchant a i.nd Kohda •Abdullah, ^lla)' : B&lt;.. oh respectively. Tiie subse quent lines v;ill bear testimony to the fact that all the allegations in the three petitions are stupid and based on unreal things, Imhammad Ilian the son of the late Raja Lai laian and your Baloch Instructor Lai Bakhsh of G-wadur ill, perhaps, be in e. better position to toll you the details of the past doings of the old man# As regards his activities Tj-iic-i are within my own know- -ledge, I consider myself duty bound to mention thorn below in detailGt- ua m&gt; way to G-i/aOur my friends and a relative of tiie old hative Aasiatant informed me at I 'us cat that they rather took my being appointed at Gwadur ..s a surprise as •.lialyusa • •Abdur iiaiiim, by \diioh the old Native Assistant often calls himself, had already written them to say aud it is a fact ) that Govern ^ent had decided that the post of British Agent should be held by tue 1 alyuz •;»bdur Kaiiim ( his age mi ftfc now be over 70 I believe) as long aa he was alive and that his son Amanullah should auceed him when he himself dies away. To quote the local Post master who incidentally travelled with me to Karachi where 1 had to be overcarried before my joining my present post, the old man only co aidered it a joke that an Indian will ever be a 'pointed as a British Agent hero. It \ as your subsequent telegram about my appoint ment that all of his hopes were frustrated. There is also sufficient evidence to show that while acting as British .M.'ent the old man had given wide publicity to the fact that he had the full support of D.P .Cr. •s Ilunshi to be appoxated as a pem -inent British A ^ent* I at first took £.11 these thin?js as a Balochi jokes at Ijiscat but found the same literally true on my arrival here. Again at ICttraohi my friends advised me to be careful of this old man, but I took it a very easy task and only laughed at them as I could never be pursuaded to believe tiiat a Oru'vernment 'Pensioner like this old man could possibly be of intriguing nature# Again' \4^en ituha imad Khan the son of the late ?.i.ja Lai Hicja frankly told me at Aarachi that his father -vwio v.r.s on the point of retiring fell victim to the intrigues devised by this old man, I hardly believed him. •.-uhammad htaa told me t. .at it was at old man^s movement that a religious decree was passed by the . iallas of G-adur that the 'Janazah- 1 vizi the funeral prayer of his deceased father was harara i.e. illegal as the deceased had eomaitted suicide. Again . le told me that in the event of his going to (Vaadur for the purpose of bringing the effects of 'lis deceased fatl: r, the old man placed di ' iculties in his way and afterwards promptc( t' ..e a/adur meroliants to file their suits in double a20 .ts by telegrams which they accord - gly did. iMtlo! v :ad J-n ilso infurmod me that in doing oo the old aan'a onl; object was to discourage A'uia.. ad I hen so thai he may n&lt;g: suceod his father.

From To. Sir, The British Agent, Gwadtir, The political Agent and l.B.l 's Cons\il, M tJ 3 C A T (at Gmdur)• eoli I have the honour to submit the follow ing few lines oith the reauest that the same may kinOljr lr transBiitted to the Authorities ffoom you are sending your 'Kecord of evidencestaken in connection with Cwadur riots, so that my comments could 'be perused in conjuncticr with the depositions recorded 'by you. Having 'been allowed the privilsfee of ioing | through the deposition of ^li, Cwadur and his forst two telegrams to I uscat ahout riots, I find that the main difference 'between his deposition and mine pertains to two points of supreme importance vis;- (1) whether Wali is right in his statement that he asked me to remand three or four of Khojas to custody on the outrage night and that I hesitated# It may 'be observed that the only witnesses ^ho can confirm this statement of Wali are Saiyid Ahmad and Seth «ietha are | no other than State employees. (?) Whether Wali and his above named State employees are right in their statement that I h*d no 'bundle of office papers and fountain oen ^ith me ^hen I 'interrOi ated about the wounds' - to n ote the words of -'aii - in the presence of wali and that I recorded neither statement of the deceased Fhemji through Muhammad ! j airoo, nor of the other three wouna.ed &lt;hoJas. Ly deposition on oath is a clear reply to the above two querries. The following two items indicate only the force of iny arguemeats by way of rofutin^ the deposition of the Wali and the party-wise evidence of his two State employees No demand whatsoever of the arrest or cuntoe of any Khojja was made by Wali on the outran o night when he was puzzled beyond measures and waving his sword to and fro. nor was ther^ at all any accusation against molmon that night though I must confess there rere plenty of Balochi accusations against Khojas on the following noon, nor did the Balochis or their headmen called Fohda# produced or named aiiy ^omided parson of theirs to sho^ that such and such .wounds were inflicted on such and n ch lalochis by such and such hojas, so as to enable wali to record their wounis --nd then submit me the nv es oi uieK.oja accused persons, just in the same ^ray as 'id ii thS ease of Khojas Via: recorded the w&gt;unds and statements of the llioja 'ounded personr and tlien gave the names of two main Balochi accused person i- writing ae confessed by Wali hir-iself. In f^ct there was no mention of -rounds nor of any accusation on the part of lalochis on the outran s night, although it was made clear to both the parties by Wali and I that it -^as incur) b^nt on the both to bring their wounded men and name the person accused. This was done in the case of Khoj as and there was KsmrBritish Residency, Bushire, 6tb. July 19 29. Dear de Smidt, Are you satisfied with the way ^aris Ali is carrying out his duties at G-wadur ? The file shows that in connection with the recent Khoja incident there he sent a series of absurd telegrams, and Murphy's report, of which you have received a copy, shows that he rather lost his head. Murphy further complains of that gentleman's attitude towards Thomas and himself, and he resents letters from Taris Ali ending up rt Love to Patrick'. '/aris All's lengthy 201 and 202, copies oi which have 'been sent me at his ovm request, are rather much. The gentleman also appears to have had a calling row, or rather less, with Halkett. Tours sincerely, Sd/- Barrett.Tfl Kai'achi, July 11th. My dear Barrett, ^ Your letter of the 6th July about Warris Ali, and Murphy's demi-official to you of the 21st June. Warris Ali is a dreadful fellow. His letters are an affliction and i have choked him off several times for verbal diarrhoea. On the other hand he is a great improve ment on the former British Agent in that he is a good linguist and knows Arabic and Persian well, whereas Lai Khan knew no English or Arabijs. Warris Ali's work is distinctly good. it is always necessary when dealing with this type of Indian to alldM a proper discount for the man's estimate of his own importance which, in Warris Ali's case / in excessive. ifou must know k hton well yourself, so you can probably understand what he is like on his own as British Agent in Gwadur. Warris Ali undoubtedly has exaggerated the Gsaadur affair, bw-t not more than the Khoja community did in their telegram to the Viceroy, Agha Khar^ etc. , etc. On the other hand Murphy is my opinion had been apt from the first to minimise the importance of the incident. We cannot get over the fact that in a rio^ started by Muscat subjects, a British Indian subject belonging to an influential community was shot. Murphy's demi-official amused me especially after ray own experience with Warris Ali at Gwadur. Murphy is behind the times 1 fear. Warris Ali on his own at Gwadur is not a uat clerk an 'Indian gentleman' ! and there is nothing for it but to thank him for his kind message to i/atrick! What a life. 1 hope you and Mrs Barrett are very fit. i suppose Shitasi is not possible. Do let me know if you are coming down here. Yours sincerely, ST)/ G. de Smidt. 4Copy of a latter No,327 dated.2^nd July f929 from the British A-;ent, rj-adur, to the Director, Persian ftulf Tele, raph in Political charge, } r ekran CoaVt, Karachi. I have the honour to refer to my D*T. of ^ords 96, dated the 10th April 19. r 9 and to the Political Agent and H.B.F's Consul, Huscat'p B.T. of ^ords 52, dated the 11th'April 1929, addressed to you and repeated to me.- and to report that the Muscat igency Suh Ass-is tant Surgeon, examined the rounds of the t w o Baloochi -omen namely Shadriah the ''ife of the accused i ^ \ * ■ : SffJ m- Isa and '^atima, as -'ell as the finger ' r ound of the so far alleged murderer of Khoja* Kemji viz. Isa, in my presence, but I never requested the Sub Assistant Surgeon to express to me his medical opinion about the above three rounds, Ap far as I remember he himself told me that he vr ould like to take the above named three '**ounded persons to Muscat ''here he ''ould again examine the Tounds more closely in the presence of the Agency Surgeon and then report his medical opinion to the Political Afent and H.B.M'f- Consul, Muscat. Accordingly he took the three bounded persons to Muscat along with him on * the 13th April 1929, as reported to you vide my B.T. of words 28, dated the 16th April 19? 9. The three —ounded persons have not so far returned to G-'-adur and as I hear the alleged ♦ murderer lea is still in the fort custody at Muscat. The Chief C^adhi of Muscat vho ''as deputed by the Muscat Government to enquire into the B-^adur riots said, on his arrival here, that he ''as the official exprt of the Muscat State for examining the various —ounds, reporting as to the nature of wounds and then fixing the.suitable SHAHI fines on the man ''ho caused the '-rounds on the '-ounded, according to the prevalent custom of the Arabs in the Muscat State. It is true that the native ''ay of settling .the w o.und disputes amongst Bedouins of Arabia and the'Baloochis of Hekran is, even in these days, to refer such ''ounds to the local ^adhi ''ho after judging the nature of the ''ound fix some suitablefine on the aspaulters w ho are then required to pay the blood or ■''ound money to the person murdered or mounded. ITigor the neighbouring Sultani village I b always and often the rcene of Baloochi Assault, as reported to you vide ray B,T« of Word® ill dated the 10th April*19ro. 1 have 'often noticed -that the wound, casea of the SultrJnia subject® in (Jwadur Territory are settled only on the above liner -, irref pective of the grievous nature of the woiindi. There is a somewhat deviation from the above procedure in the case of wrund cases taking place in the British Mekran,' where, a® my experience warrants, assaulters are not only got fined by the ^adhis, but also imprisoned and punished according to the British Indian La-v. All this was by the way only, so a-s to explain the native Tr7 ays of dealing with such wound cases. Such a wound case between a British Kekrani and a Sultania subject is arousing public interest at Gwadui? and I hope I T-ill be able to let you kno™ of its intere; ting -details by the next boat. Now adverting to the three wounds of the alleged murderer Isa and the Baloochi ^oraen, I submit that the Chief Q,adhi of Fuseat examined the three rounds in' question in ray presence and in fact this was the only enquiry ''hich he made of this serious case during his for tnig htly stay here , as already reported to you vide ray D.T., of words 169, dated the loth ■ April 1929, and ray office letter No.237-S, dated the 7th June 1929, forwarded to you Under my letter No.238-S of the same date. Copy of the Chief p-dhi's official opinion which is on,my files sho w s th.t the finger wound of Isa and the arm wound of his wife are pistol wounds. As far as I understand the medical opinion about these w .unds is that both these wounds were and are not pistol wounds - a fact 'iiich is a keynote of the whole trouble and —liich -'ill tend to substantiate my official opinion th.t the ''oimds of the Baloochi. '-omen w ere cultured ones ard their statement tutored ones. If this is true, as it is believed to be, it is just the same opinion as I personally had during the riots. This is why I, for the secondsecond time, ^as emphatic in expressing to you (vide ray D.T. of words 96, dated the 10th April 1929) the necessity and importance of sending a Doctor to Oadur, although the same necessity TrT as duly expressed to the Political A^ent once* before, vide ray D.T. of ^ords Nil, dated the 28th 11 rch i:&gt;29, addressed to .'ou and the Political Agent, Muscat,. My riot file does contain the written opinion about the -'ounds in q.^c«tlon. This opinion is of the Chlwi ;.,adhi in hife iii-iidTTitiiift. file UK. copy of thv -edic-l opinion of tiieefe '.rounds and I know that apart from the fact that this opinion wjuld strenghten the case of the rijh tful party o £ the t' T o contending parties of Khojas and Baloochis, the record of &lt; —— — —^ such a medical opinion on my file seems absolutely necessary to me for determining the veracity or otherrise of rome important official statements of the British Agent, G-^adur, r 'ho is the only official to know properly of the quaint intrigues of ^-adur. As re-jards the tutoring of the Baloochi w oraen and of culturing of the wounds, attention is invited to ragraph 26 page 8th, of my letter No,237^8, dated the 7th April 191 j ,ad'drer^ed to the Political Agent, Kuscat, copy forwarded to you under ray letter TTo.238-£, dared the 7th April 1 9.' 9. '/ith a view to making my records about riots as Complete poss ible, as also to enable rae to make my future comments (which may perha.ps be invited from me by the trying Magistrate of some other competent authority) as clear as poss ible, I consider it important that I should hrive a copy of the afore said medical opinion on my file. I am also anxious to contrast this opinion with the Chief ijadhi's opinion whjch is already on my record.

Lieut.Ool.C.O.J•Barrett,0.1.B.,0.^.1.&gt; political Resident m the rersian Gulf, Buahirej,Copy of a D.O.dated 16th September 1929 from Mr,B,S,Thomas,0.,B,E., finance Minister f Muscat State,to Major G.P.Murphy,!,A.political Agent and H.B .M 's Consul,Muscat, In compliance with your letter of to-day's date I send a note on the Khoja and fishermen dispute ( 1926)in Gwadur, II, See two enclosures of letters extracted from my file, (i) A petition from the fishermen of Gwadur to the Sultan (rough translation), (ii) A note to me from tne Customs Appraiser at Gwadur (Author a Hindu), III, Stated 'briefly the position was this.The fi5h merchants Agha Khani Luwatis and Banias combined to buy the catches from the fiShBtmEn at unfair prices. The fishermen were unable to retaliate (a) on account of their uncontrollable numbers and lack of Icnpwledge how to combine (b) because they were nearly all in debt to the merchants(their deniaJ of this in the letter to the Sultan is mendacious). Their posi- ! -tion as debtors was in fact at the root of the trouble. In slack fishing season a merchant made advances to a fiSherman,con- -ditionally on he (the merchant)being alone entitled to buy the f ±2 fisherman's haul. This was fair,so long as the merchant was pre- -pared to pay a competitiTe price for the fish,But in practice the creditor put a price on the fish which was unfairly low. The object of tne combine indeed was that vi /hen a master acted tnus and the fisherman demurred,no oth^r merchant should buy tne fish, IV» I visited Gwadur after a fortnight of the operating of this employed Agreement as it threatened to cause trouble,held con- -ferences of both sides and settled the matter amicably on July 16th 1926, V, One appreciated the difficulties of the iQiojas which were inherent in their own poverty; for with tne exception of (i) RJUMTULLAH BASHIR (QAMR XV BIH and Coy/who last year ran the small steamer to Gauz and Jivni to shot circuit Gwadur at the expense of Rs, 10000/-.to Gwadur Customs, (ii) BANDAR ALI &amp; CO, Scarcely an Agha Khani Luti of Gwadur has any money at all.The fish merohanta were in a position in fact of being obliged themselves to raise loans in Karachi and to a smaller extent from Gwadur Banians to finance their business.Thus were they faced witli having to meet interest on capital* Their combination designed to maice the fishermen bear most of the btu den^was ho.-ever clearly inequitable,The problem was solved by Uduaas a Banian fish merchant and GoTernment contractor quitting the combine, and thus restoring the fixation of prices by the natural process of supply and denand. The troubles of the Agha Khanis of late appear to be that their name is not good any more for raising loans at small premiums,for their transactions with their own creditors hare been .such that jata * practically no one will advance them money,The resulting tightness at Gwadur reacts in the nature of things upon the fishermen with whom the problem is one of capital and labour and the two elements being of different and antegonistic sects tends moreover to maJce the breach wider.^ Dated, Slat Dhil Haj 1344 corresponding to 8nd July 1926. ^^f-The8ultan i3 »Taimur 'bin jfaisal, We the undersigned Gwadur Fishermen,respectfully beg to state that the fish merchants who are 'buying fish from us have held a meeting 15 days ago and have all agreed and combined to reduce the prices of fish. The Icind of fish that is actually worth Rs.200/-.will be bought at Rs.lOO/~and mm . that was sold at R3,100/«its price is fixed at Rs.50/- only* This shows that they have reduced the prices ^to half and even also less than half. The liice of this has not happened before.

In this connection, we have again been approached by the same merchants who are particularly anxious, for us to arrange for our steamers to call at Jeewani at regular intervals. T7e have been informed that the contract for the collection of Customs Duty at Jeewani terminated at the end of T'arch and that since the 1st April a 3/' duty on import and export has been collected by a Customs Official of the Khelat Government at Jeewani. The merchants i;ive us to understand that as our steamers do not call at Jeewani, they are obliged to send their goods via Gwadur, thereby being- forced to pay a duty at C'wadur in addition to the 3;' at Jeewani. As a result of this t|iey state th.- t shippers from and to Jeewani are at a serious disadvantage compared to those at Gwadmr. Ueshall be obliged if you will kindly let us knov/ as soon as possible whether in your opinion the Company's steamers' calling at Jeewani would adversely affect the Customs collections at wwadur. As the Ahelat Government appear to have established a proper Customs post at Jeewani, we shall be glad to know whether this Customs post is recognised by you and if you allow free transhipment a* Gwadur on goods *to and frora Jeewani. -&gt;r ifr 7r ic -yryir Ic-XHfc- 0 Py of letter dated Gth August 1929 from i'essrs v^j Eaclrtnnon Mackenzie and Co., Bomb^ to the Politicel A&gt;;ent and n.B.H's Consul, ruscat#. ra3lii gy/iidur We liave tne honour to inform you that for some little time past we have received anonymous letters making various allegations against Messrs..

Last March a riot occurred in Gwadur between some Indian merchants, who are followers of the Agha Khan, and some Baluchis, and in the course of it an Indian was shot. Subsequently Murphy and ihoraas went there to investigate the matter, but the evidence was inconclusive, and the murderer was never found. The Government of India are rather perturbed about it. The whole thing happened before I arrived here, and I do not think it is possible to re-open the matter now. I am however removing the British Agent at Gwadur as soon as I can find a man to take his place, and the foreign Secretary has suggested that if pos sible a ship should visit tue place with some one in authority on board. I am therefore writing to enquire vdiether it would be possible for you to call in at Gwadur on your way up to the Gulf in May next. If so, and if you could let me know the approximate date \m* Captain H. Boyes, C .M.G., H.M., Senior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, H.M.S.

The Khassab business is, I'm afraid, proving somewhat troublesome to Alleyne. If however I get the requisite support fvom Government and Thomas goes down and imposes a heavy fine with a sloop to enforce it, it will I think have a most salutary effect right along the Trucial Coast. I understand from Isa that the Bhaikha think that now the League of Nations is in existence they can flout us «ith impunity. And I must say our attitude to Persia gives much colour to this view. 1 hope you are ifit again, and benefitting by the change. %No. fop 1930, British Residency &amp; Ocnsulate-Oeneral, Bus hi re, the //^AJril igso.

Senior Naval Officer^flonf Idential « ^ BIND CLUB, Karachi, dated 17th May 1930. I visited Gwadur the day 'before yesterday and had a long discussion with the Khojas and saw the place where the murder was committed. I confess that I do not feel very happy ahout the matter and I know that Mr. Howell shares the feeling. It is of course difficult to reopen it now, hut I will discuss the matter with Mr. Howell at Simla. Tou have doubtless heard that Isa was accorded 4rzfcf a great reception on his return and now appears^a popular hero. This is extremely unfortunate and has naturally annoyed the Khojas yet more. As my telegram will have told you I do not consider it necessary to change the ¥ali. The Khojas themselves admit that he did what was in his power to defend them when the row occurred and I had a discussion with him and the Baluchi leaders and told him that he must take adequate steps to reassure the Khoja community. 'While I am not prepared to take all that the latter told feta aa I think there Is no douht that the Baluchis do jeer at them and the fact that Isa was only given a short sentence and then was accorded a triumphal reception on his return is not calculaued to make them feel inclined to overlook the past. 'fcaris Ali will he transferred a^ soon as he is relieved by the man you are getting. the latter that he should report to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs in Karachi who will give him certain instructions from me and information regarding past affairs. I propose to X^ll himthat in cases where Baluchis make any insulting remarksremarks to Khojas It ahftpldjje promptly Tarought to the notice of the Wall and^W: he severely punished. I hope th tha^t it will h© possible for the Muscat State to send more /«*« or askaris to Gwadnr. I understand that oi the present 21 men there, nearly half are employed in menial capacities as servants to the Wali etc. and that only ahout 10 or 12 are actually available for duty. This number is insufficient and steps should be taken either to send extra men there or to ensure that all the men at present there are available for the maintenance of order and are not employed on extraneous duty. One word regarding Khassab, It has all ended satisfactorily and I think it will have a good effect both on Oman and on the Trucial G&amp;ast. At the same time as you are doubtless aware the Arabs in the vicinity of Khassab have in the past made difficulties about Survey parties landigg there and I cannot help feeling that before the 6fflsn party was allowed to land there the matter should have been referred to me and the fact that difficulties might arise brought to my notice, I asked Thomas to ensure that the Shaikh of Khassab received humane treatment and he said he had taken the necessary steps. In view of the fact that it was entirely through our instrumentality that the surrender was brought abouti wehave every right to insist that he should be treated by the Muscat authorities as we would ourselves have treated himhad he been our prisoner. Would you please interest yourself in the matter and see that he receives suitable treatment and not as prisoners have occasionally been treated in the Muscat State in the past.1^ 26th May, 1950. {♦v^ .yh ' Reference your letter of the 17th May from Karachi. I fully share your feeling about the unsatisfactory nature of the Gwadur affair. At the time I submitted the joint report I never expected it to be the conclusion of enquiries. I had expected ¥aris All to be transferred immediately. His efforts at obtaining evidence had been futile and with new blood I had hoped further facts would come to light, I still think more would be discovered if discreet enquiries were made by some experienced officer of the C.I.D. I think the security which has been taken from the* Baluchi leaders will have a good effect. I am asking the Council to send some more Askaris there. As regards Khassab; I would certainly have referred the question to you if my instructions that H.M.S.'Ormonde H wished to land on Musandum had not come from your office. There had been some trouble in 1927 when two scallywags were sent to take thermometer readings, but otherwise I do not know of any survey party having been obstructed before. When Col. Haworth visited Khassab at the end of 1927, the Sheikh express ed regret that the thermometer readers had been stopped. He permitted Squadron Leader Keith to climb the heights and was most friendly, holding my hand as we talked down to the beach whilst his tribesmen did a dance and sang a song in praise of Col. Haworth. Moreover, when I first mentioned the obstruction to Saiyid Said and Sheikh Zubair, the latter who had spent his youth in Khassab evinced surprise, stating these sheikhs had nevernever sho^rn the slightest opposition in the presence of one of H.M. ships 'before. H.M.S.'Ormonde M was accompanied by an emis sary from the Muscat State, a man well acquainted with those parts. Unfortunately H.M.S.'Ormonde' seem to have used him more as an interpreter than as an emis- sary, and when difficulties cropped up, perhaps due in the first instance to trouble in obtaining guards during Ramazan, they shipped him back to Muscat and proceeded to do without him. He was returned to Muscat on the 8th February, whilst the trouble over the sfali did not take place till March. I feel that though such troubles may to a certain extent be due to the weakness of the Muscat Govt, they are largely due to the spirit of these times. Events in India and our forbearance in dealing with situations promptly have no doubt encouraged these tribesmen to imagine they can obstruct us with impunity, I fear that we shall meet with similar opposition to wards the opening of an air route from Aden and any other activity we may engage in in these parts until such time as the tribesmen realize that ours is still a power to be reckoned with. Saiyid Said has promised to see that Sheikh Hasan has proper treatment. iF r The Hon^ble Lt-Col.

But his criticism is in no way malevolent. He makes no accusations on his own account but simply acts as 'vakil' for his co-religionists, for whom he is naturally anxious that they should get justice, which, you will admit, it is at least doubtful whether they have succeeded in getting. As for his locus standi the appearance of the politician in matters of this sort is a sign of the times which one just has to accept. It therefore strikes me, if you will permit me to say so, as rather silly on Powle's partbbs* To part to take the high and mighty line as he does, and to aescribe Hahimtoolah as directly accusing Murphy and Thomas 01 deliberately stifling evidence is simply absurd, I should consequently be obliged, should you feel that there is any force in these remarks, if you would convey to Fowle that he would do well to preserve a more balanced attitude of mind and use more temperate language in his oificial and demi-official correspondence.

Slease see your last parag a,he for instance. If you loolc up the file you will see that the extent of the 'murdering' or w iioleating' with impunity which you refer consists of one Khoja (iChimji) killed in a scuffle in the spring of 1929, one Agha iflmni grave-yard defiled on the 4th August 1930, one (ihulam Ali murdered last February. Any incidents of this nature are of course to he deplored, 'but viien one compares these particular ones with the really serious intercommuii|al affrays which occur in India they assume their proper proportion. with regard i)e, to the action of the Muscat State please see paragraphs J I ^ s- n n 5 ~ 9 of ray D.O.Mo.K.49 of 15th tieptemtoer 1930 to Colonel i/t 1 &gt; to Biscoe. As you will see ray opinion is^the Muscat state has taken drastic action in defending the interests wf the Agha Ihanis. 3. with regard to the mentality of fee Agha iOianis - ^Utical Agent, Muscat./ 8 ee paragrajis 10 and 11 on the sane letter. / 4, ihe Jfliimji murder was inreBtigated thorouglaly. I vtomd up with the depositions of 4 witnesses produced More than a year after the murder had taken place { ray letter Mo. f 47-C of 3rd March 1931). 'rhe case was finally closed toy J\r Ln&gt; the decision of Mr. Ho%ell i irlde his letter of 23rd April forwarded to Muscat hy the (lovemment of India under endorse- / ment Mo.f.42S-^/20) # and I trust that you said no tiling to r y the Khojas to encourage them to think that it would be re- f opened. With regard to the defilement of the. grare-yard * the outrage might have been committed toy any mischieTous ^ individual' ( see paragraph 8 of my if.o.Ko.K,49 of 15th '!September). » f 5, With regard to the murder of Ghulam Ali please study the enquiry which ShaiJsh Zubair and I made ( Tide my iy letter Ho.72-C of 17th larch 1931 to the Political Hesident). though over 30 witnesses werejexamined there was nothing to show that the Baluchis had a hand in this, and the murderer say ^ust as well haw been a Khoja. You will note that my impression was that the Agha Khanis seemed to have something to conceal, at any rate, they did not give much assistance in our enquiries. i.ii 6. I do not agree in your estimate of the British Agent. l|y opinion of him is contained in paragraph 8 of my (t letter ^©•97-C of 18th floveraber 1930. I think that it would have been better if you had reserved your opinion until you had had more experience of his work anc of Gwadur in general. 7 * I think you were &lt;pite correct in getting the Baluchi night watchman changed for Arabs, if the latter are .are likely to ¥e more satisfactory, 8» X do not altogether approve or your suggeation to the Muscat aovernment to furnish another wall for G^adur, and I thinic it would ImTe been better if you had referred the jaatter to me first. The real weaiaieBs of the wall t that is to say any Wali, in (jwadur was tliat formerly he had not enough force to back him: only about 30 askaris to the best of my recollection. Mow that he has night watch men his position is stronger* In the present financial condition of the State they may find it difficult to provide more askaris to garrison Qwadur, but it is in that direction and not in substituting one wali for another that something might be done t if the situation warrants it. 9. with regard to the past. The iOiimji murder (1929) is finally closed. ihere was never any hope of discoTering the mischief makers who defiled the Agha ahaffii grave-yard, the Ghulsm Ali murder was promptly arid exhaustively enquired into by ShaiJch Subair - the Muscat Minister for Justice - and myself» but without result, There was no evidence that it had been committed by Baluchis. Is fact the Kho4as gave us no assistance in our enquiry* and personally I got the impression that they were trying to conceal something. If # however# any further evidence comes to light it will of course enquired into. 10. with regard to the present. The fact that the ^hojas - as you point out - stay in their •sort* at night because of fear of the Baluchis does not indicate quite the state of affairs which you imagine. The iOiojas in many places ....places have their 'lorts'. In Muscat for example - or rather Muttra, which are merely special carters of the town, surrounded toy a Wall, in which the larger portions of the coEsiaunity live together. What it means then in awaclur is that those Khojas who live outside the fort at ni^it go in and double up with their nei^ibours. This As of course inconvenient for them, but. I very much doubt if they do it as a regular thing. It is a common practice of the iSho^as at Gwadur on the arrival of a Political officer, or M.M. ship# to go into the fort in order to impress the visitors with the urgency of their ease* isven after the murater of ahulum Ali for instance, they had been living outside the fort. On my arrival a few days later they imuediately scuttled into it» The Agha Khanis are always read/ to let fly a stream of vague accusations • especially to a new officer*. i^toen it cemes down to details however, and they are asked to give their grievances categorically, they cannot produce very much ( vide paragraph 7 of my letter Mo.97-0 of 18th MoveRiber). Md you empire from them idiether, since the date of my last visit to awadur, the Baluchis had molested them in any way ? On this subject • i.e. general molestation - all they could complain of to me was that sometimes some of the more ignorant of the Baluchis were rude to them, Had they anthing more serious to complain of to you this time ? presumably not as you did not mention it* 11. With regard to the flitui e* The crux of the situation is that while we are of course prepared to look after the interests of the Agha Khanis, and to press the Muscat Government to take adequate action when incidents happen@ bappenji which we have do ne )j the real solution is that the Agha Khanis themselves must come to some sort of modus •givendi with the people aaongst #10m they have to live, i.e. the Baluohis. Hew that they have night guards in addition to a British Agent resident there, do not see what more they can expect. X regard the jQioja-BaLuch Committee as of considerable importance. It is on the lines of Conciliation Committees which are formed in India to help the authorities to keep the peace between rival communities. X can quite understand that, as you say, nobody appears to want it: there are always a number of people, on both side^of a quarrel, who prefer to cherish their animosities and their grievances. But by no means all the Agha i &amp;anis y are violently anti-Baluchi ( see paragraph 8 of my letter Mo #97-0 of 18th Movember), and X met one or two Baluch leaders in awadur last February who appeared reasonable 1 11 persons, ( paragraph 4 of my letter Mo.48-C of 3rd March f vf 1931). With a little tact and pressure think it should be possible to form the sort of committee I have in mind # from the moderates of both parties.

The Sultan has taJcen offence, a rather deep one too as you will see by the attached draft, at Shaukat Al^s activities at Gwadur, not at his visit but at his interference, without permission from His Highness, in the affairs of Muscat subjects - the laluflhls. The telegram he refers to is the one from ShauJcat Ali of 14th April 'brotherly relations established'. Shauicat Al^s interference also involved, without reference from us, interference in the affairs of our subjects - the Khojas, but - more especially as his activities were innocuous - personally I have no feelings on the matter. It is of course fortunate that His Highness and 1 were able to arrange the Khoja-laluch Committee, so that when Shaukat Ali arrived he found no troubled waters to fish in. 3.

The draft was giren to me personally for my consideration by His Highness after an interview at which he orought up the matter, so there will be no difficulty about its cancellation, ihat I suggest is that I should assure His Highness that Government had nothing to do with Shaukat All's visit - I got the impression from our interview that His Highness had at the back of his mind the vague idea that the visit may have been 'inspired' officially, i would then propose to His Highness that as the matter was thus really one between His Highness and Shaukat Ali, His Highness through his Secretary should write direct to him. I will endeavour to see that the letter is a much milder edition of the draft and merely says that much as His Highness appreciates the visit of such a prominent Muslim to his territory as Shaukat Ali, it would have been more regular if - before entering into the affairs of Muscat subjects- he (Shaukat Ali) had asked for permission first from him - His Highness^ or some^Jshing to that effect. v/Ould you please telegraph if the above de^marche has your approval?Draft letter from His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, to Lieut.Colonel T.C.Powle, C.

We like peace but how Showkat Ali ventured to interfere with the affairs of a town which had nothing to do with him. Did he ask our permission or did he think that wei were unable to establish peace between our subjects and foreigners? Such interference on his part in our affairs and those of our subjects is not desirable and we request the Government to ask Showkat Ali, who is one of their subjects, as to the cause of this interference and indulgence in affairs which are not his concern, and who has deputed him to act as a medium for making peace between the two communities at Gwadur.
