India Office 13. 422. P. 1632/30. Exercise of Jurisdiction in Cases affecting Foreign Subjects in Bahrein by the British Political Authorities. Jurisdiction over British Subjects. 1. Article 4 of the Convention of 1861 between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the British Government provides that “ all offences which they (British subjects) may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decisions of the British Resident, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily.” Jurisdiction in Cases affecting Foreigners. 2. By the Agreement of 22nd December 1880 and the Exclusive Agreement of 13th March 1892, the Sheikh bound himself not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Governments other than His Majesty’s Government; not to allow the Agents of such Governments to reside within his territory without the assent of His Majesty’s Government; and not to alienate, mortgage, or give for occupation any part of his territories save to His Majesty’s Government. Responsibility for the protection o f foreigners in Bahrein may be regarded as having passed to His Majesty’s Government as a corollary to these two Agreements. But the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have arisen in an active form until 1900. In December of that year the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a German subject, Mr. Wonckhaus, intended to open a branch of his business in Bahrein. The Political Resident suggested that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between Bahreini subjects and Mr. Wonckhaus or his agent, the Assistant Political Agent should be instructed to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Sheikh. 3. The Government of India informed the Political Resident in reply that “ Mr. Wonckhaus being a foreigner and not a protected person, the Assistant Political Agent cannot claim any jurisdiction in such cases. Mr. Wonckhaus and his agent, if a foreigner and not a native Indian subject of His Majesty, must be regarded as liable in such cases to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. “ As, however, the Sheikh is bound, under treaty, not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without the consent of the British Government, it is expedient that the British representative should, as a matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to European foreigners in any disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects, and, in the event of necessity, he should claim to protect all such foreigners as he would a British subject. I am to request that Mr. Gaskin may be instructed to this effect.” The action taken by the Government of India was subsequently approved by His Majesty’s Government. 4. In June 1903, the question having arisen of the purchase by Mr. Wonckhaus of certain premises in Bahrein which he had hitherto held on a temporary lease, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident as follows :—“In view ... of the belief which Mr. Wonckhaus is reported to hold that, in the event of his acquiring property, he will not be amenable to local law, but will be subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of Courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consul or other representative of a foreign nation the right to enter into direct relations with the Chief, and that, should any such official address the Chief, he should be referred to the British authorities. The position should also be clearly explained to Mr. Wonckhaus.” 4371 75 3.30 Lr. d. 4 May 1901, No. 708 E.A., end. in G. of I. Desp. 72, of 9 May 1901 P. 614/01.

In 1904-5 two incidents affecting foreign subjects took place in the Islands. In the first of these, a German subject—an employee of Messrs. Wonckhaus—became involved in a brawl, in the course of which he suffered personal injuries. Failing, as he thought, to secure adequate redress through the Political Agent, to whom his first complaint, was addressed, Mr. Wonckhaus made representations to the German Consul at Basra, who addressed the Sheikh direct on the subject. His Excellency, in reply, acknowledged the letter and added, “ I have now to inform you that this matter is before the British Government, and I cannot say anything on the subject.” The Foreign Office at a later stage instructed the Charge d 1 Affaires at Berlin that, should representations be made to him in the matter by the German Government, he should state that it had been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government, and that a British ship would be sent to Bahrein in order that an inquiry might be instituted. The German Government do not appear to have taken any action. The German Consul at Basra subsequently thanked the Political Resident “for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles the case.” 6. In the second case (November 1901), an accidental quarrel having arisen between a retainer of the Sheikh’s nephew and a Persian, attacks were made upon Persian subjects in Bahrein. Apprehensive that the Sheikh would endeavour to deal with the case in the local Courts, they telegraphed for support to the Shah, and conversations took place between His Majesty’s Minister and the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, as the result of which the latter telegraphed to the Persian community urging them to keep calm, as “I have had a long talk with the British Minister . . . and I am sure he will take early steps to get the affairs settled and the culprit punished.” The Sheikh, however, adopted an uncompromising attitude on the question of jurisdiction, maintaining that he would not admit any interference “ in cases between Arabs and Persians, who were all Mohammedans;” and that they must go before the local Shara Courts, which, composed as they were of Sunnis, were unlikely to do justice to the Shiah Persians. Argument proving unavailing, an ultimatum was presented to His Excellency. He accepted the demands of His Majesty’s Government, and though no specific reference to the point was made in the ultimatum, the jurisdiction of the Political Agent appears thenceforth to have been definitely established, as a a matter of practice, in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. 7. Correspondence took place between 1908 and 1911 in regard to the preparation of an Order in Council to confer jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in the Islands on the Political Agent at Bahrein. It was decided that it was desirable to obtain a formal request from the Sheikh that he should be relieved of jurisdiction over foreigners. After discussion with the Political Agent, His Excellency addressed the latter on Kith July 1909, in the following terms:—“ After compliments. It is not hidden from you that I have had considerable trouble in many cases (that arose) in my territory in which foreigners were involved. For this reason I wish that I may not be held responsible in these cases, and I would be grateful to British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me. I mean that it (the British Government) should exeicise authority in all cases in which the foreigners onlv are concerned but not in other cases ; and in cases that occur between foreigners and my subjects, it is necessary that you and 1 should settle them joinHy.” 8. The Political Resident remarked, with reference to the reservation contained in the concluding sentence of the Sheikh’s letter, “As its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the joint Court, and gives foreigners the same treatment that British subjects now receive, there seems no need for exception to be taken to it.” 9. The Sheikh subsequently represented that his letter of 10th July 1909, giving jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government, was intended only “ to cover subjects of recognised Powers and not the dependents of petty Arab potentates in Gulf, with some of whom he claims9 O to have special arrangements providing for reciprocal acceptance of each others diiect jurisdiction. I informed him that if he could produce agreements, and if the other parties, on being referred to, acknowledged then 'validity, 1 thought we should be prepared to recognise them . . In the light of the protest in question, the wording of the Draft Order in Council was amended to its present form, under which (Article 8 of the Oidei in Council of 191.3) the power conferred by the Order extends to the persons and matters following in so far as by Treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means, His Majesty has jurisdiction in relation to such persons, matters, and things, that is to say :— (1) 1 British subjects as herein defined within the limits of this Order. (2) foreigners with respect to whom the. ISheikh of Bahrein has agreed inth His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. (o) Hah rein subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of llritish subjects or foreigners; with the proviso that all cases wherein such Bahrein subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of this Order. (4) 1 he expression ‘person to whom this Order applies’ shall be construed in accordance with the above three sub-Articles. (5) 1 he property and all personal or proprietary rights and liabilities within the said limits of British subjects and of foreigners within sub-Article (2) and of Bahrein subjects within sub-Article (3), whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits m of this Order. (G) British ships and ships belonging to foreigners within sub- Article (2) with their boats, and the persons and property on board thereof, or belonging thereto, being within the limits of this Order; provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not be exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High Court in England in the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships. (7) If any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country, State, or tribe have or have not been placed under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the Political Resident, and a certificate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.” 10. Part Sf of the Order, to which reference is made in Article 8 quoted above, deals with the important class of case, whether civil or criminal, in which the parties are respectively a Bahrein subject and a person to whom the Order applies. The procedure laid down in it is as follows: — “ (a) Criminal. Article 41.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to institute a complaint against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to institute a complaint against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall entertain the same, and may— (a) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, himself hear and determine it in his District Court, or (b) send it to the Joint Court, or (c) if the defendant is a Mahommedan, refer it to a Kazi for decision, sending a representative of the Agency to record briefly the proceedings. Such decision, when endorsed by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be considered as if it were that of the District Court. (21 Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Political Resident from exercising the revisory powers possessed by him under Article 4 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated the 31st May 18Gl.' :i: ' * See para. 1 above. Viceroy’s tel. to S. of S. for India of 6 July 1912, re peating tel. from Pol. Res.: P. 2632/12.4 (b) Civil. Article 45.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to bring a suit against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to bring a suit against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall admit the complaint, and (a) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, may hear and determine the suit in his District Court, or (b) may hear and determine it in a Joint Court, or (c) may refer it to the Majlis-el-Urf for decision, or (d) in cases between pearling-masters and divers, may refer it to the Salifah Court, or (e) with the consent of the several parties, may refer the case to one or more Arbitrators for settlement. (2) The judgment of the Joint Court or of the Majlis-el-Urf shall for all purposes be considered the same as if it were that of the District Court. (3) An appeal from the decision of the Salifah Court shall lie to the Political Agent acting in concert with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and in all Salifah cases their joint decision shall be final. (4) The award of the Arbitrator under Sub-Article 1 (e) shall be final, and shall not be open to appeal unless the same shall within a reasonable time have been ordered Ity the Political Agent to be set aside on the ground that it is not final or is defective, or that the Arbitrator has exceeded his authority, or has been guilty ol; misconduct in the matter. (5) Nothing herein mentioned shall prevent the District Court, the • Joint Court, the Majlis-el-Urf, the Salifah Court, or the Arbitrator from referring any matter in the progress of a suit which involves a point of Mahommedan law to a Nazi for decision, or from sending any party or witness, being a Mahommedan, to a Kazi for the administration of an oath.” P. 5040/20. P. 5668/27. Pol. Res. Desp. to G. of I., No. 295 S, of 1 Sept. 1927, para. 28. 11. At no subsequent stage does the Sheikh appear to have shown any signs of going back on his delegation of responsibility in respect of foreigners other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty’s Government. Difhculties, however, arose in the post-war period in connection with his claim to exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and inhabitants of El Katr. In 1920 protests were received from Ibn Sand as to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Sheikh over Nejdi subjects. A similar protest appears to have been made at about the same time by the Sheikh of Qatr, both parties requesting the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction on their behalf. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November 1920 a notice that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab Pulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. The decision was not well received by the Sheikh ; but it has not been contested by him, and since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British Political authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922, as subsequently amended.
