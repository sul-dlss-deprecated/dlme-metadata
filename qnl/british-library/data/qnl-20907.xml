It will be seen that he now names the individuals holding the nominal appointments at Odaid and Zubarah. As regards Wakrah I imagine that the r J urkish authorities satisfy the requirements of their record by styling the son of Shaikh Jasim bin Thani who acts as headman there, as ' Mudir ' in the same way that they address Shaikh Jasim as Kaimmakam of Katar and Shaikh Mubarak as Kaimmakam of Kuwait. s / a n No. 780, dated Bahrain, thp November 1910 (Confideimw^, Wth ;f rom —Captain C.

This Ali is the nephew of Ibrahim, who was until recently the Mudir of Ojair, and he is thus acquainted with the internal workings of the Hasa Office. s 2 When Suad Beg, Mutasarrif of Hasa, returned to Ojair in the S S John O'Scott on the 5th August 1910 {vide diary No. 280) after temporarily acting as Vali of Basrah, he brought with him two men, one named Sulaiman Eflendi and the other is named Abdullah Effendi (mixed negro blood). He first wished to appoint Abdullah as Mudir of Ayun, and Sulaiman -is Mudir of Odaid, but at the request of the latter the two appointments were interchanged. The pay of these posts is said to be 60 Rials each. 3 The name of the Mudir of Zubarah is also Abdullah Effendi, not however to be confused with the Abdullah Effendi of negro blood. 4. I can still find no corroboration of the appointment of a Mudir for Wakrah; on the contrary, this rumour is denied to have foundation. 5 Ao&gt;ha Abdul Karim bin Agha Hasan, referred to in my previous letter Nn 75Q was Mudir of Odaid till recently, and the mistake thus crept in fs he was known to many people under hi* old title as Mudir of Odaid.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002fa_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/27</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002fa</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/27</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File: E/4.
