Palestine. There were disturbances in Bahrain as a result of the United Nations Organsation’s decision to partition Palestine. These will be described in more detail below. At Kuwait the Shaikh succeeded in keeping perfect control and no disturbances took place though funds are being collected to assist the Palestine Arabs. E|s|^ewhere there have been no reactions beyond a sermon in a mosque on the Trucial Coast. 2 Resid ency Staff . Mr. J.A. Croning, I.S.O., M.B.E., has pro ceeded on leave to India pending retirement. For many years he has been the Political Resident’s right-hand man in all confidential office work and lor the last four years he has been officiating as Under Secretary. He was described to me by my predecessor as ’’the key-stone of the Persian Gulf admin istration.” He will be greatly missed. 3 . On the 22nd December Major A.L.A. Dredge, M.B.E., arrived to take over as Secretary. The Political Resident has been without a Secretary since Major Pettigrew left on the 15th August and has had to devote an inordinate amount of his time to routine work. On the 26th December Mr. R. Andrew and Mr. T.D. Stobart of the Foreign Service arrived in Bahrain for training. Mr. Andrew is being attached to the Residency as Under Secretary and Mr. Stobart to the Bahrain Political Agency. Major J.E.H. Hudson is expected to return to Bahrain as Assist ant Political Agent early in January. 4- Education . Mr. Highwood of the British Council visited Bahrein and Kuwait during the month and inspected all the schools at both places. I have not yet received his reports but I gather from him that considerably more money is spent on education at Kuwait than at Bahrain and that the standard of education at Kuwait is higher than at Bahrain. Mr. Highwood did not visit Muscat partly because there was hardly time for him to do so and partly because it was considered undesirable that he should carry out a detailed inspection in the Sultan’s absence. I paid a brief visit to the only school at Muscat during my recent tour there and was favourably impressed by what I saw. The school which contains primary classes only is under a , Palestinian teacher and the accommodation and organisation appear to be good. Economic . Some control of imports is being exercised through exchange. Only very limited quotas of hard currencies have been allotted to the Persian Gulf States but imports from hard currency countries are fairly extensive as black market dollars are readily available both at Bahrain and Kuwait. In Bahrain the rate for these dollars recently fell as low as Rs.3/10 but it has now risen again to K over Rs.4/-. /Exchange for E.P, Donaldson, C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office Downing Street, LONDON. S.W.lExchange for imports from soft currency countries can only be obtained on certificates of recommendation from the Political Agents issued with the prior approval of the Political Resident. At Bahrain and Dubai where there are banks there are no rest rictions on the conversion of rupees into sterling and conse quently there is no control over imports from the sterling area. In Kuwait owing to a misunderstanding of instructions a cert ificate of recommendation from the Political Agent is still required^before rupees can be converted into sterling, and this restriction has been allowed to stand pending further instruct ions from His Majesty's Government. In Muscat wh^re there is no bank trade, as previously reported, is at a standstill owing to restrictions imposed by ,the Reserve Bank of India under which the Muscat merchants who are nearly all Indians cannot operate on their accounts in India without the specific sanction in \ each case of the Reserve Bank. During my recent visit to Muscat I interviewed deputations of leading merchants who pressed that either the restrictions should be removed or that a bank should be opened in Muscat. A representative of the Eastern Bank is to visit Muscat in January to examine the possibility of opening a branch there. Amongst other rumours of a financial nature which the Muscat merchants produced was one that the Government of India propose to remit all their balances in India to the Muscat Treasury. The currency situat ion at Muscat is peculiar. The local currency in the interior is.the Maria Theresa dollar and all local products have to be paid for in this coin. There are only about 5 lakhs of rupees current locally but 22 lakhs are locked up in ihe Government of India Treasury and an even greater sum is believed to lying moribund In the Muscat State Treasury. (r Arrangements are being made for the Gulf States' requirements of sugar to be obtained in future from the United There is a surplus of this commodity in most parts of the Gulf at present and it has been possible to remove price control in Bahrain. There is however a serious shortage at Muscat where the annual quota for the last few years has proved insufficient. .It may be possible for Muscat to make up its immediate deficiency from a surplus which exists at Dubai if the price demanded for it by the Dubaj^ood Company is not too high. ^ There is a serious shortage of meat at present at ahram due to a stoppage o f ’ imports of livestock from Persia, it is not clear whether this stoppage is seasonal or due to action by the Persian authorities. Mr * Pennycuick a representative of Messrs. John Birch ana Company has visited Bahrain during the month. The firm has already established a branch in Bahrain and it is proposed in due course to maintain a fairly large staff there for the purpose of providing engineering services throughout the Gul^ States. BAHRA IN. ■p , , ^ As already mentiored disturbances took place in Bahrain during the three days December 2nd to 4th as a result of tne u.N.O s decision to partition Palestine. It appears that certain agitators decided to follow the example of Arab States lu Eas t in calling for a three days strike and that one Bahrain Government were taken by surprise. On the first day the schools opened in the morning but some bovs in the kiuharraq schools managed to :all out all the students there and a party oi them came to Manama and persuaded the schools there o close also. The boys find others paraded about the streets tti ^ process ion and amongst o'sher things broke the windows of the pastern Bank where there are a number of Jewish employees. The nn Z ?v? r S losed throughout this and the subsequent two days, un the 3rd December the Shnikh ordered the closing of the schools /and there- j were...and there were orderly processions escorted by the police and watched by the Shaikhs and others. Slogans were shouted again- st the Zionists. Americans and Russians and in favour of the British. On the third day the Shaikh ordered the schools to be opened but the order was not obeyed. There were again processions in the bazaar and riff-raff, consisting mostly of Persians, Omanis and other foreigners from the dhows, in the rt-ar of one of these began to loot a house which was used as a synagogue by Jews. Looting of other Jewish houses and a few shops immediately began but ceased on a few shots being fired into the air by the police. Three Jewish women and one blind boy were severely injured and one of the women subsequently died. The police arrested a number of the looters. Since then there have been no further disturbances but leaflets were issued calling for the boycott of the races and Christmas cele- brations* Up to date although some of the foreign ers who took part in the looting have been proceeded against no action has been taken against the agitators primarily respon- cu b }fu f 0 :r , t 5 e ^ rou ^l e * &amp; letter is being addressed to the Shaikh pointing this out and asking him what action he proposes to take to prevent further disturbances. None of the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s employees went on strike during the trouble .■ ! : et;t:ers threatening sabotage were subsequently received by the Manager who is nervous owing to the almost complete lack of any protective force should a mob from Bahrain endeavour to attack the refinery or Awali Camp. Mr. Henderson, American consul at Dhahran, who called on me during the month spoke f to me about this subject and said he was preparing an evacuation scheme for the Americans in Bahrain. I have discussed the c subject of the protection of the Refinery and awali with ^ n J- or v Nav 5 1 4 _O ffice r, Persian Gulf and Mr. Russell Brown ana it is hoped that a satisfactory scheme will be evolved for dealing with a possible^attack though I personally consider an e r n J Uallty 1 unlikel y- Dr » Harrison of the American ^ £ aS wcrked for the good of Bahrain and other parts f 2 r some T 40 years was insulted during these disturb- aS mJ ara aware no other Americans have been wf^f rf ^ red W 1 l :h I v The threats received by Mr. Russell Brown arp demands for the removal of certain Jews who tbe Com P an y- T ke local Jews who have been lu ? ahraln f or many years have issued a manifesto ex- contrihnfp sympathy with the Palestine Arabs and have also ^ i ^ t ^„ fUndS T f0r ^ heir su PP° rt - IHe Shaikh has issued an order forbidding Jews to land in Bahrain. - nr t been reached regarding the division of the sea bed between Bahrain and Qatar largely with a view to two e ShaikhdnmQ ere ^ 0il ^?^P anies Holding concessions in these line S fo^nw ma y permitted to operate.

He is already occupying the house built for him at Bait al Falaj although it is not quite finished The Muscat Infantry are well turned out and the Guard of Honour which they provided on my arrival could hardly have been better ed. . So far as I am aware however they have had little field training and it remains to be seen how they would behave in an emergency. The men are mostly Baluchis and number of them come from Kalat State. U&gt; Towards the end of November the Political Agent visited Sur where he hoped to obtain further information regarding the looting of the u Star of Mex” which ran aground near Has al Hadd early in 1947. He was so carefully watched however that he was unable to make any confidential enquiries. Maritime i ( In my monthly letter for October I reported that a survey of Has al Hadd was to be carried out preparatory to the erection of a lighthouse there. The Government of India have now decided that no survey should be carried out pending the transfer of responsibility for the Persian Gulf Lighting Service to His Majesty 1 s Government.

About 250 persons called on me including British, Americans, Arabs, Persians and Indians. His Highness Shaikh Salman did not call as he was indisposed but his senior uncle Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa came and asked that his congrat ulations should be conveyed to their Royal Highnesses. At Kuwait a fair in the English style was held at the Kuwait Oil Company's camp at Magwa and attended by British and American residents and Arab notables. At Muscat the Political Agent received a number of . calls in the morning and in the afternoon was at home to the British and American residents and the local notables. The Sultan of Muscat and the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait sent congratulatory messages and the Shaikh of Banrain also seno a’present of pearLs. The Indian communities ac Muscat sent congratulatory telegrams and the Khoja community are proposing to send a gift. 2 Oho Oh,olerg..

Actually the Shaikh was suffering from a severe cold. H.M.P.S. 'Godavari' was orilluminated while lying off Jufair on the night of 20 th November to mark the occasion of the royal wedding. c. The economic situation is generally satisfactory at Bahram and Kuwait where the markets are well stocked. Merchants find black market dollars easy to obtain chiefly from audi ^rabia and considerable quantities of American goods are e ’ . Pr J^ es continue to rise especially in Bahrain where there has recently been an all-round increase of wages.

On the 3rd November mg was held m the Taj Mahal, Manama, to collect funds in aid of...I - page 3 - in aid of the Palestine Arabs. The Ruler's junior uncle. Shaikh Abdullah, presided and a total sum of Rs.66,000 was collected or promised. The speeches made were moderate in tone. There have been numerous visitors to Bahrain, including Sir Henry and Lady Holland from the C.M.S. Hospital, Quetta, the Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem and Mr. Highwood of the British Council. Sir Henry Holland spend 8 days in Bahrain and performed a number of eye operations. Mr. Hi ghwood is spending several weeks in Bahrain and is devoting much time to local educational problems. Sir Feroz Khan Noon, - I und,ir- /stand he still likes the title used though he has renounced it - who is apparently Mr. Jinnah's Envoy to Islamic countries \arrived without notice by air from Saudi Arabia on the evening of the 21st November and was delayed for 3 days before he could obtain an onward passage by air to Karachi. I am told he spend a vast sum of money in telegrams of protest about this delay. He lunched twice at the Residency and was taken by members of the Kanoo family to call on the Shaikh also without notice. He donned Arab head-dress for the occasion. According to the Shaikh his conversation with him was Entirely innocuous. Various distinguished visitors have passed through Bahrain by air and amongst them Lord Ammon and other members of the Parliamentary delegation to China had breakfast at the Residency. The Bahrain Government have completed the construct ion of their new customs shed and goods in transit can now be held at Bahrain for 90 days on payment of 2 % duty. g KU WAIT I visited Kuwait from the* 12 th to the 18th November and had several^talks with Shaikh Ahmed whom I found, in good h health and spirit. Possibly the absence of the leading members of the Salim family contributed to his cheerfulness as ( Shaikh Abdullah has recently left on a visit to India while Shaikh Fc;had is in Syria. Shaikh Ahmed showed more inclination than previously to accept British advisers and has asked that lists of names of persons suitable to advise him on finance, customs and police should be furnished. His Majesty's Govern ment have made a gift to His Highness of 50,000 rounds of .303 ammunition and one hundred 3 -pounder shells. * Kuwait has also had many visitors. Mrs. Bolton and Mr. Merrow of.the United States Congress who as mentioned in my disa PP oin ‘ ted us at Bahrain visited Kuwait from the 20 th to the 22nd November. They called on the Shaikh and Political Agent and attended a number of parties but do not • pr ~ w appear to have said anything of interest politically. Senator Malone on the other hand appeared at Kuwait without notice and without sotisa in ■thetiniddle of the month and expressed very strong views.about.the European economic situation. From Kuwait he paid a visit to Riyadh. Oil magnates have been buzzing round Kuwait like bees and the auction for the Neutral Zone oi! concession still geos on. Nobody seems to know when ^.r en( 3* The latest bidders are the American Independent U u ^ om P an y whom thei^ rivals describe as 'mean operators' and who have made a bid including a rate of royalty whicn has rather staggered their competitors. n Th? Shaikh informed me that he had not yet touched the 20 lakhs instalment of royalty which he received at the end ol July. Meanwhile a certain amount of progress has been made in new works at Kuwait. The building for the new male hospital has been more or less completed with an imposing but ugly facade but so far contains no equipment and no sanitary installations. Close to it the new Sharqiyah school has been completed and is m use. Work has been started on the new road which is being driven through...- page 4 - driven through a closely inhabited area from the custdms house to the main square; it is said that about 30 lakhs are being paid as compensation to the owhers of buildings which are being demolished. . As stated earlier in this letter the quarantine s restrictions imposed by the Iraqi Government had the effect of depriving Kuwait of her supply of drinking water. The Anglo- Iranian Oil Company assisted in remedying the situation by sending a water-tanker daily with a Persian Naval rating on board who was responsible for seeing that nobody went ashore, and the Kuwait Oil Company brought in a piped supply of water from a well about 8 miles away in the desert. / Abdullah, son of the late Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah whose escapade at Khorrhmshahr and subsequent flight to Kuwait led to so much correspondence has now settled down permanently at Kuwait as an employee of the Oil Company. He has received some money from his father's estate and hopes to obtain a share of the land. ^ QA TAR The Medical Officer of Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. was called in to attend Shaikh Abdullah, who suffers from diabetes, on the 13th November and found him in a precarious condition. He remained under treatment for a few days and is now reported to have recovered his normal state of health. 10 TRUCIAL COAST j The Shaikh of Sharjah has sent the Political Agent, Bahrain a strong protest regarding the remarks made about him and his brother Shaikhs in a book called 'The Sand Kings of Oman' by one O’Shea who was the B.O.A.C. Superintendent*at Sharjah in 1945. The descriptions in the bock of the manners and customs of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs and their subjects are conspicuous amongst an amazing farrago of inaccuracies as containing an element of reason and truth. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in spite of pressure brought to bear on him by the stop ping of his.quotas of cloth and sugar still refuses to accept any responsibility for making his allies at Buraimi return the large number of camels which they have looted from Dubai. (( MUSCAT His.Highness the Sultan is still at Dhofar and has announced his intention of' not returning to Muscat until after the visit of the P.C.L. survey party there in February. He has asked that in future the Zanzibar Subsidy should be paid to him at Muscat instead* of in India. Mr. Hartley, the Director / of Agriculture at Aden was to visit Dhofar in the latter half of November to advise the Sultan regarding agricultural development there. Oman tribes are still continuing to cause trouble by raiding on the Batinah Coast though no details of any particular incidents are available. To stop the raiding by some of these tribes the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has put a wooden barricade across the Wadi el Qaur through which the road from Shinas to the Trucial Coast passes and has blocked with concrete and barb ed wire some of the ravines leading into it. The Muscat authorities have also sent a deputation to Buraimi and the niegh- bcuring country to buy back some of the looted animals and ;sou dissuade the tribes from further raiding. The Imam is reported to be ill again and his supporters are said to be pressing him to nominate a son of the previous Imam Salim bin Rashid as his successor. MARAT I ME . . .\ i A /^-MARITIME.

D. 0, No»1910--S Lrn !/• - ' &gt; PERSIAN GU LF RESIDENCY the 6th November, 1947 bahiiain The following is a a summary of events in the Persian Gulf Residency for October. J ' r i ’ GENERAL . I returned to Bahrain and took over again as Political Resident on the 6th October. Lieut-Colonel A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., left for the United Kingdom on tb following day. Outwardly little seems to have changed during my 3-g- months’ absence from the Gulf. The Arab States ' are watching with interest and some anxiety events both in India and Palestine but there is no sign of anything in the nature of agitation though a few thousand pounds have been raised for the Arab cause in Bahrain. The Shaikh of Bahrain reparked to me that he was a great admirer of the British Government but that they had made two big mistakes in leaving India too quickly and Palestine too slowly - a dictum which probably accurately represents local Arab opinion. In Bahrain there is some kind of underground youth movement that has been agitating in the Press and elsewhere against Mr. Belgrave’c administration. Dissatisfaction at the slow progress which is being made in improving Bahrain’s amenities and ensuring her continuance as the chief trading centre in the Gulf is not confined to an underground movement bu t i s wide s pread.. During my absence the Bahrain Petroleum 'Company have granted an all-round ■wage increase to their employees and tne Bahrain Government and other institutions have found it necessary to follow suit. Owing to the developments that are taking place on the mainland, in Qatar at Kuwait and elsewhere the demand for labour all along the Arab shor'e of the Gulf greatly exceeds the supply and Oil Companies may find it necessar 3 &gt;- to grant still further increases. The cholera epidemic in Egypt has seriously affected our communications. The Saudi Arabian Government have forbidden all intercourse between the mainland and Bahrain because B.O.A.C. ’planes which land in Egypt and India pass through Bahrain. For the same reason B.O.A.C. flying-boats are not for the present allowed to land at Basrah. Owing to the this prohibition Kuwait is unable to send any air mail to India. To add to our difficulties the 3.I.S.N. fast mail boats the ’’Dumra” and the ’’Dwarka” have for reasons unknown and without any notice to this Residency ceased to call at Muscat. We are still very short of officers. There are at present only four British officers serving in the Gulf administration and I have no Secretary and the Political Agent Bahrain is without an Assistant Political Agent and a Political Officer Trucial Coast. At Bahrain a large number of judicial case are accumulating which would ordinarily be tried by tne Assistant Political Agent and there are several important questions pending on the Trucial Coast which urgently require the presence of a political officer there.

Pakistan stamps have actually b^ibrought into use at Dubai and have arrived at Gwadur. ■ B AHRAIN c I exchanged calls with the Shaikh and his'two uncles on arrival and cilled on them again on the occasion of the Id. The Shaikh is in good health but is much perturbed by the prohibition imposed by the Government of India on the import of pearls Tho uncles are chiefly concerned with the prohibition oijrintercourse with the mainland which interferes with their hawking. In fact it is iamoured that they even suggested /that quarantine should be more strictly.enforced at Bahrain and B.O.A.C. planes not allowed to land here so that the ban may be removed and they may enjoy their sport. The younger uncle Shaikh Abdullah has now decided to visit an alternative hunting ground in Kuwait territory and has booked up all available accommodation on the 'Dwarka' which is leaving Bahrain on the 10th November thereby seriously interfering with my_ plans to visit Kuwait. With the advent of Directors f Weather' Bahrain has had numerous visitors including Mr. Hanna, Vice-President of BAPCO who is here for about a month, M va . Dunkley a Director of the 5 Iraq Petroleum Company and Mr. Weightman an ex-Political Agent, Bahrain and Foreign,Secretary to the Government of India. A number of distinguished persons including Lord and Lady Addison and the Parliamentary Delegations to China and Japan have passed through by flying-boat and been met by the Political Agent or myself We were expecting a visit from certain members of the United States Congress but they have hot appear ed and it is presumed that quarantine restrictions have been too much for them , Cap bain Dendy R .N. the Senior Koval Officer, Persian Gulf paid a farewell visit to Bahrain from the 24th to the 28th October and stayed at the Residency. Advantage was taken of his presence and that of Mr. Walters from the Ministry of V/oiks Cairo to discuss the question of certain accommodation required by the Royal Navy at the Jufai; Naval Base and of the futui e site of the .Residency. ;c .or . iave ipe. vis. id 3.hr His Highness the Ghaikh of Kuwait spend a few hours on shore on his way back by sea to Kuwait.

The ban on the import to India is a serious matter for Bahrain and the Trucial Coast as at present Bombay is the cencre where Gulfpearls are graded, processed and si distributed. . » ^ i' Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company now have 17 '* European employees based on Bahrain, some of whom are working at Has Tanura and Mishaab. The firm are dealing with shipping at the latter place which is the port that is being used for the accumulation of material for the Trans-Arabian Pipeline. They are experiencing considerable trouble with the Saudi Arabian Customs authorities there *and information on the subject has been sent to His Majesty's Legation, Jedda. As a result of the increase of wages granted by the Bahrain Petroleum Company the seamen and motor trans- port ^drivers of the B.O.A.C. went on strike on the 1st October. The Station Superintendent recommended to his immediate superior an increase in the wages paid to local labour and the strike ended after three days. It is not knownwhether the increase has yet actually been granted. KUWAIT . Shaikh Ahmed returned from his visit to India oh the 15th October. The Political Agent has informed me that he looked thinner and older. He'has told people that he greatly enjoyed his visit to India especially the greenness of Bombay and Poona during the monsoon. The exact object of his visit to India is not known but it is rumoured that he was endeavouring to realise some of his investments there. So far as is known he only visited Karachi, Bombay and Poona. The auction for the Neutral Zone concession is proceeding apace. New companies have entered the field and higher and higher bids are being made. The Shaikh shows no signs of calling a stop to the proceedings. TRUCIAL. C O AS T. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi continues to refuse to accept responsibility for the Manasir tribesmen of the Buraimi area wno are in alliance with him and have been carry ing off Dubai camels in increasing numbers. All his quotas of food supplied have been stopped and it may be necessary to bring proper pressure to bear on him. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast),Ltd., have set up^their camp in Abu Dhabi territory about 10 miles north- west of the Abu Dhabi ford. Survey work was due to begin on the 15th October. There is a danger of their operations being interfered with by the bad relations between Abu Dhabi and Dubai^ and the absence of any fixed territoital boundary between the two Sheikhdoms unless unless an early settlement of both these matters can be reached. MUSCAT. His Highness the Sultan is still in Dhofar and shows no signs of returning to Muscat. It is rumoured that he proposes to remain there until the arrival of the Oil Company survey party which is not expected until January. Major Greenwood, late of the Baluch Regiment arrived in Muscat on October 20th and took over charge as Commandant of the Muscat infantry. The Political Agent reported in August that he had received representations that the Government of India had imposed a total prohibition on the import of dates from Muscat. ^ This was a most serious matter as the dates on the Batinah Coast are prepared in a dry form and used almost exclusively for weddings and other ceremonies in India. No alternative^market could be found for them especially at such short notice and the prohibition meant ruin for the cultivators and heavy losses for the Indian merchants who handle the fruit. Enquiries from the Government of India have after nearly two month's delay elicited a reply that there is no total prohibition of the import of these datesu - page 3 - but that the import quota has been reduced by 50 per cent, and that there is no prohibition on their import by country j craft c A small consignment of old arms and ammunition on its way to Kuwait from the Mahra country has been detained by the Muscat authorities. The Political Agent reports a certain restless- ness amongst the tribes who occupy the area Buraimi, Dhank and Yankul in Oman, where Petroleum Concessions Ltd., propose to send a party during the cold weather. The Wall of Shinas came to Muscat on the 12th October with a story that certain tribesmen from the area hapl entered into his district with intent to kill him. MMIIIME. It is understood that the 'Nearchus' will shortly be taking a party to Has al Hadd to carry out a survey preparatory to the erection of a lighthouse there, but it is unlikely that anything further will be undertaken until the future of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service has been finally settled.

The Shaikh has informed Tandy that he proposes visiting Constantinople for about ten days alter the ’Id al Fitr for a change of air. it is doubtful il he starts, is always contemplating journeys but gets cold teet or some thing at the last moment and stays at home. Abdullah iOiaza’al was informed by the Persian Consul at basra early m the month that tViere was no objection to his returning to Persia. He applied tor a passport out probably will not leave Kuwait in the absence of any guarantee as to his personal safety. Doubtless he has learnt his lesson and does not wish to 'follow in father’s footsteps'. Tandy says that the shaikh Vias appointed him his representative with the Kuwait Oil Company at bhuwaikh. xhe report received in June that all Jews m Kuwait had been ordered to leave appears to have been exaggerated as only four Jews were expelled - three Bahrainis and one Iraqi. The reason given for their expulsion was 'dishonest trade practices'. The Bhaikh has since told landy that he has no intention of expelling any Kuwaiti Jews. Cable and Wireless Limited have inaugurated a direct wireless service between Kuwait and Hiyadh. the earlier service was via Bahrain. During the month the Bnaikh received an enquiry from irantour asking for permission to open an air service to Kuwait.

Meanwhile, All om Obaid bin Miftah alKhatiri, chief of the Khawatir tribe of Ras al Khaimah has also claimed Dhaid as his property, and in order to establish his claim he adopted a novel method oi purloining a donkey from the one time owner of Dhaid (and now demanding it back) and having jogged all the way there proceeded m true Arab fashion to blaze off his rifle into the air. He thus made a big fuss, but his sons wisely followed him and when all the firing was over calmly tied him up. 7-W Oj 'V ' i. iJ-C-u l 1 1 A j_i L.O.

Shaikh Khalid has so far rejected all proposals made to him and has stated that he is not prepared to cede any part of Dhaid or to admit the Shaikh of Sharjah 1 s claim to sovereignty. He is reported to have added that the Dhaid question was settled by His Majesty’s Government 22 years ago and that he is averse to accepting any other settlement. He has also rejected the offer of half the income from any oil found in the Dhaid area if he recognised Sharjah's claim to sovereignty. a /y ?!• ' D.O. No. 1082 - S.

The outstanding event of the month y&lt;S) has been the visit ef shij^s of the Uni.ted States Navy to the Gulf. A new heavy cruiser the 'Toledo” visited Bahrain from the 10th tf* tho 13th Hay and two destroyers the 'Hyman' artf the 'Hanlan H. Dickson' visited Muscat and Kuwait respectively about th* same time. During the presence of th© 'Toleda' at Bahrain Admirals Conolly and Gle«ver arrived from London and the former hoisted his flag in the cruiser. Formal calls were exchanged at, the various places Visited and all courtesies meti culously observed. Parties were given ashore and opportunities were given to officials and leading members of the public to visit the ships. No incidents occurred but some difficulty was experienced in persuading the officers commanding the ’xoledo' and the 'Hanlan i\. Dickson' to limit the salutes given to the Shaikhs «f Bahrain and Kuwait to the number of guns authorised by His Majesty the King. l t I paid a visit to Delhi in the latter half #f May in ertfer to discuss with the 'External Affairs Department of the Government of India a number of problems relating to the transfer o± the control of the Gulf administration from the Government of India to Kis Majesty's Government. During the m®nth .*.. P. Donaldson, Esquire, C.k.G., India Office, LONDON. /#' I IPH* 8 . 7 During the month the British Overseas j irways corporation instituted a new Plymouth service one ; weekly between Che United Kingdom and Bahrein with a shuttle ser/ice between Bahrain and Karachi. This has proved a great convenience to ooth Officials and the general public. Iraqi Airways have also instituted a thrice-weekly service between Basra and Kuwait. Bhis service has not been formally authorised by His Majesty's o-.-ernment and is to some extent the result of a private arrange- ment between Iraqi Airways and the Kuwait Oil Company. There is some prospect of the establishment of an Indian air service setween Karachi, Sharjah and Bahrain and of an Irqi Airways service between 'Basra and Bahrain. If Arrangements have been made by private companies to import substantial quantities of sugar from sources other --han India to Gulf ports particularly to Kuwait. This has led co a threat by the Government of Idia to stop all export .f -.ugar to the Gulf ports. I discussed the matter while in Delhi .and it was agreed that any Shaikhdom which import d sugar from tourcqs other than India should have its quota of Indian sugar Ut b ? the amount so imported but that States which had not received such Imports should c.ntinue to draw the- quota of Indian sugar. i- IMbAIH. A few weeks ago the Shaikh vrote me an ntentperately worded letter about the action of the Assistant - olitlical Agent in suggesting the release on bail of one of the Shaikh's renegade subjects who had visited Bahrain from -.atar to see the folitical Agent and been arrester while on his Way tf ° the A sency. I passed the letter to the Political Agent ‘' )0 S ,roteated to the Shaikh about the terms in wh&lt; ch it was ou hid and discussed its subject matter v/ith him ot length. Jae incl,3ent m *y now be regarded as closed. As 1 havfe remarked Previously the Shaikh suffers from an obsession regarding his allegjed rights in Qatar- and is always liable to be unreasonable over any matter which touches his relations with that State. Visitors to Bahrain t • • •Visitors to Bahrain have included hr. &gt;iax Thornburg and his wife and Mr. Davies of the African and Eastern Corporation (Near Bast), Limited. Mr. Thornburg apparently only came to Bahrain in order to inspect his island which he visited daily while he was here. kr. Davies is examining the possibility of establishing a branch of his company here, a development to be welcomed as introducing some competition with Messrs. Gray Mackenzie who have long enjoyed more or less of a monopoly here and of late have been the target for a good deal of criticism from the public. As I mentioned in my last report the local merchants with- the support of the Bahrain Government have been thinking of setting up their own landing company hut it is now reported that they have made their peace with Messrs. Gray ^.ackenzie who have agreed to reduce some of their rates. During the manth I paid a visit to Hawar Island where the Bahrain Petroleum Company are now beginning to prospect. This island is in the ^effective occupation of the n. a in Government who maintain a guard #n it. A second pipe line ^froii the naudi Arabian mainland is being laid to the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s refinery at Sitra which will almost double the supply of oil from Saudi Arabia for refinement there. This has nob plpased the dhaika but the Company are acting within their rights under their agreement and the Bahrain Government is not entitled to charge any duty on oil brought from the mainland to the Refinery. ^Cable and tireless concession which &amp;ives the Company the right to maintain a wireless station at Kuwait for e period of twenty years has at last been signed. The Shaikh waived his demand for an annual payment of £ 500 at the request of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Southwell/ Managing Director of the Kuwait Oil Company, has been on a visit to Kuwait during the month. Mr. T; K.

The situation however is now reported to have eased somewhat and the inhabitants of bharjah are enjoying quieter nights. The lhaikh Has al khaimah has allowed his brother and nephews, with whom he has been on bad terms for some ninths-, te^return t. ^as al khaimah unconditionally.

There d. net, however, appear to be grounds fer protest as the incident tqek place in Persian territorial waters' and the ,boat’s manifest vas not in order.*4 t — 1 P' Se 5. y • About eighteen months ago a decision was reached to erect a light beacon at r'arsi Island which is situated almost in the middle of the Gulf between baud! Arab and Persian territory. ' e island for long has been regarded as the property of the -naikh of Jvuwait. Ihe Saudi Arabian Government have learnt of the project and stated that they claim the island. It was p orosed that the '?earchus' should erect the beacon between the 2/th ;.ay and the 4th June but it is not yet known whether the work has actually been taken in hand. A Notice to Mariners regarding t e erection of the light beacon has been issued by the Gasra Port Directorate. ^ « It ie now learnt that there is no truth whatever in the rep.rt that an attempt had been made by a Syrian doctor to assassinate Ibn Saud by means of a poisonous injection. It x appears to have arisen from the face that Dr. --orm of the American Mission, tahrain, arrived in Ibn Saud's c rap immediately after the dismissal of a Syrian doctor. I have been informed by the manager of Messrs. ' Jj ay aokeni ’'i0 at Bahrain that the Arabian American Oil Company h?Ve selected ;as al '' ishaab, which lies just south of the huwait- oeudi. Arabian Neutral hone, as the site of the port at which the P-pe^ for the trans-Arabian pipe-line are to be lanced.

Iraqi Airways have also applic 5 for permission for a thrice-weekly service between Basra ari Kuwait. Unfortunately the loyal Air F.rce are withdrawing most of their personnel from Bahrain and Sharjah and it is doubtful whether adequate facilities ca be . provided at these daces for scheduled land plane services. At '-.•wait, also the ground organisation is probably inadequate to (opa with such a service at present. Indian pilgrims I'ujia Office, LONDON. #3. Indian pilgrims attempting to enter Saijdi Arabia on foot have been turned back both at the port of Al Khobar opposite Bahrain and on the Xuwait-Saudi Arabia frontier, and I have been asked by His Lajesty'., Minister, Jedda, to try and -prevent further parties cf pilgrims fro-., attempting to perform the pilgrimage on foot. n considerable number of Sindhi pilgrims have been arriving in Kuwait via Basra and some of these have entered Saudi Arab:a by lorry with the intention apparently of making a living 1 / begging until the time of the Haj at the end of October. The Government of India have been asked to do what is possible to prevent pilgrims of this type making their way to Saudi Arabia through th- Gvlf ports so long before the time of the pilgrimage. Y. i-ikkiA 1 » During the month the Siring Kaces and the police and school sports have been held. All these functions were attended by the bhaikh and large numbers of the public. -he Shaikh unremittingly continues to pres? his claim to zubarah. He has imposed restrictions on exports to »atar and has complained that Shaikh Abdu ah of .atar has settled in the'Zubarah „rea jsome tribesmen whs have absconded from Bahrain. Shaikh Abdullah when approached c ? the subject refused to re,„ove these tribesmen elsewhere but has stated that he is willing to come to some agreement with Sh’-'kh Salman regarding their treatment of each other 1 r subjects. The agreement made between Bahrain and Qatar in 1944 was very rague in its terms and is now more or less a dead letter but it is doubtful whether the parties can be induced to enter into a more satisfactory agreement to take its place, he Bahrain Petroleum Company have increased production and the .royalty received &gt;y the &gt;haj.kh for the second half of 1946 amoun ted to nineteen l iha as coraparedjto fifteen lakhs in the pest. Tnere has been mi * pilfering of goods discharged by Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Cor. ,any, limited, from steamers at Panama and Sitra and on these and o her grounds the local merchants have been conducting a cam-- ign against the Company. The „ahrain Government &lt;-•40J Government are now supporting a proposal to form: a local landing company on the lines of that which eicists at Kuwait. Messrs. Gray Moekenzie's &lt;Sontr*ct with the Bahrain Government is due to terminate on the 13th hay next but the Bahrain Government have not given them the six months notice of their intention not to renew it as they are bound to do under its terms. j • MMU. Negotiations with the Shaikh for the Cable and V-ireless Concession have continued throughout the menth, the only obstacle to their conclusion being the Shaikh's insistence on being paid an annual sum of £ 500 as a considera tion for the facilities he is undertaking to accord to the Company. The latter are objecting to this payment on the grounds that they are a public utility and not a prefit-making concern and that no payment of this kind is made in other places where they have obtained similar concessions. nt the end of March the American Ambassador in Iraq, Mr. G. Wadsworth, paid a two days' visit to Kimait during which he dined with the Shaikh. The shaikh has transferred practically the whole of the oil royalty he received last December amoufiting to over ten lakhs of rupees to his Revenue Department. On the ISth April an Iraqi Camel Petrol of eight men attempted to disarm a bedouin encampment soutn-west of Vmr Nigga. Shots were exchanged and the Iraqi patrol withdrew leaving one dead. Two Iraqi armed patrol ca.s ca a to the spot the same night and removed the corpse. The iolitical Agent subsequently visited the spot which he reports to be eight miles within the Kuwait frontier. A representation has been ma de to Kis Majesty's Ambassador, Baghdad. x&amp;kAi' Sfv-ikh $hdul ah’v*. health has deteriorated and according to medical opinion he is . ot likely to live for .-.ore that, a year or two aod may die euddenly at any time. 7.

The Shaikh of lubai's brother ? shaikh Juma, who was ordered to reside in Bahrain as a result of the incident in which the Political Offic r. Trucial ; ast ? and the ..esidency ent were fired on has no yet been allowed to return and it is reported that ohaikh v&gt;aid s eldest son ? ^’.aikh id r-fhid, is anxious that he should remain in Bahrain for as long as possible. Shaikh Ju,.a appears quite happy in Bahrain where he appears to spend most of his time in the Panama baz-aar. ..haikh nil recently paid a prolonged visit to v .ishm Inland wnere he is reported to have slaughtered hundreds of gazelle. J the courtesy of the .Senior I-aval Officer, Persian culf, 1 paid a visit to ^'Ualah i n ’hVild Goose n during the first naif of t.^e month. I found the Sultan in very good health and soirits. He has made many additions to his palace since my last visit in 1942 and it is now a very find building. The Sultan loves Salalah, which is certainly a very much pleasanter snot than Muscat, and it has almost become his capital. He pi eposes to return to Muscat in November and has stated that he wo;-ld like to visit Bahrain in January or February. Ke has given up his proposal to go to India this Spring, and now has some idee of visiting the United Kingdom next year. I. liajor C.tewart had been at Salalah since the middle of March negotiating with the Sultan a new Civil Air Agreement and facilities for the ^oyal Air Force. The new Agreement was signed by tne Sultan and myself on the Sth April. Under it he .-ece'ved a subsidy of £ 6,000 per annum in return for facilities gran'ed both for civil aircraft and for the Aoyal Air Force at Salalah, fe-asirah and Gwadur. The Sultan has also agreed to gran the l *oyal ’avy ce. tain facilities asked for at Khor Auwai free of all cost. • I spent four days .... Apage 5. U T c a • ( ■- ' ^ I Is c nt Tcur days Bt and through the courtesy of the Sultan was sble to see a good-olTIhe crontry • : I was much impressed by its fertility and there is no doubt that much oouid b© e r^Tn th^wry agricultural develfrnmnj^r* the I Sultan has already planted new gardens which produce bananas and papayas in abundance, and is experimenting with sugar-cane and the cultivation of the frankincense tree which so far only grows wild locally. I visited Kisut which is the anchorage at the west end of tin Dhofar bay where the Sultan and the Royal Air i^orce land mos of their stores and on April 6 th the Sultan himself took arty consisting of the Senior Jtaval Officer, Persian Gulf 4 d seve :’al n: val officers, the Political Agent, and myself to 1 ibat and Murbat. Darbat is a beautiful valley in the hills v . •-h a lake in it, and IPurbat is a small port at the eastern ex of the Dhofar bay with an anchorage where there is shelter frr the north-east monsoon. Incidentally the Sultan report hat seme time early in March five French men-of- W ar including a cruiser spent two days iu this anchorage. Ihey were sailing eastwards and had put in because of engine trouble in one of the ships. The oultan has constructed a reasonably good road to Furbat and has half-finished a branch road leading ovey the fo4)t-hills to Darbat. Sir Cyril Fox’s geological / report on Dhofar had not been received by the Sultan when I left Salalah but I understand th it it is optimistic with regard to oil. The Suli-n proposes po have it published in India. 1».

I went ashore for a few hours at Muscat where I excha ed calls with the Regent, Saiyid ohahab. Having receiv. a call fo. assistance from the Quoin lighthouse we paid it a sit and found that a few days previously a member of the Jighth .se staff had got drunk on'a bottle of rum and threatened to .urder his companionsf The Senior Naval Officer took him on board. he cruised up the. Elphinstone Inlet and paid a visit j Khor ~uwei, returning to Bahrain on the 13th April. *3. Mr, Byers of the Imperial -^ank of Iran has recently visited Aiusca and decided that the economic conditions do not justify the opening of a branch of his Bank there. 1 ^* Th&lt; Sultan * s plans for the peaceful penetration of Oman have received a set-back by the death of one of his chief supporters, Shaikh Mu ammad bin Isa al Barthi, who only succee ded his father a year ago. It is reported that the Imam is in [ much better health and that there is no longer any pr ospect of his early demi -e . Vhen recently asked to nominate a successor he is said to have refused to do so. /jT. to Several cases of interference by Persian naval vessels with Arab dhows have been reported.

A rumour is prevalent in Bahrain that an attempt has been made by a cyrian doctor to assassinate Ibn Saud by means of a ’'isoncus injecticti. Ibn Baud’s suspicions were somehow . 0 ,. A♦ page 7 . somehow aroused while the injection was being prepared and he arranged fer Dr. Storm of the American Jtission at Bahrain, who was then in rfasa, to be fl^wn at once to Riyadh in order to test it.

They believe that we are only pretending to withdraw with a view to proving that the people of India cannot govern themselves and that in due course we shall re-establish our rule. They criticise adversely the callous way in which we are permitting the sacrifice of thousands of lives in the pursuance of our object* l■ There is a hope that in May the B.O.A.C. will establish air services between Bahrain and the United Kingdom and Bahrain and Karachi though no call is to be made at Dubai. Meanwhile tentative enquiries have been made from Messrs. Skyways Ltd. whether they are willing to enter into an agree ment with the Bahrain Government for the establishment of a local service. ' Communications by sea have been somewhat improved by the appearance in the Gulf of the first of the B.I.3.N. Company’s new motor boats the ’♦DumraB. Her first journey to Basra and back has been made the occaaion of a number of parties on board but in spite of or possibly because of these celebrations she reached Bahrain on her return journey several days behind schedule. 3. The Gulf States have been fortunate up to date in that they rarely appear in the news. It is feared that this blessed state of affairs may not continue. Mr. Boxall of Reuters has paid a visit to Bahrain and arranged for a local correspondent there. A Reuters’ correspondent is also likely to be appointed in Kuwait. Mr. Windham of the '•News of the World” has refiently paid a visit of a few days duration to Kuwait and there are other journalists prowling round. 4« Mr. Spinney the head of a big firm of provision merchants at Haifa and said to be the owner of 2400 pigs has recently visited Kuwait and is shortly to visit Bahrain and ^atar. He is to undertake the provision of •’stores* for the Kuwait Oil Company at Kuwait and for the P.C.L. at Q,atar. He has been asked by Aramco to run a hotel for them in Bahrain but it is not know whether he has agreed to do so. BAHRAIN. $• I called on Shaikh Salman on the 27th March and found him in very good health and spirits having recently spent a few days hunting in the south of the island. Lt.-Col. A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., handed over charge as Political Agent to Mr. C.J.Pelly, O.B.E. on the 11th March and left with Mrs. Galloway for Bushire on the 17 th March. Visitors E.P .Donaldson Esquire, C.M.G The India office, LONDON. FXT. • 9have included the Rt. Rev. H.W. Stewart, Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem, l£r. Turner of the Ministry of tforka and Mr. Sinclair Telecommunications Attache, Middle Bast. Mr. Turner is examining the various sites proposed for the new Residency in Bahrain and it is hoped that a final selection will soon be made. KUWaIT. , ' I visited Kuwait with my wife and daughter from the 9th to the 20th March. We travelled in both directions in H.M.S. 'Wild Goose'. I met Shaikh Ahmed on several occasions and found him in very good form. He is at present living out in the country at Bayan and there appears to be no immediate \ prospect of his visiting Ibn Saud. I gather that the recent change in the local management of the Kuwait Oil Company has come as a great relief to him. His only grouse at present relates to his date gardens in ira^ about which he spoke to me twice. I met the other leading members of the As Subah and we dined with the heir presumptive Shaikh Abdullah Salim who took great pride in showing us all over hie house at Sha»ao on the sea shore. We spent two days in the desert close to t^e western border of Kuwait with Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak the only surviving son of the famous Mubarak and took part in the hawking of bustard. Mr. Patrick, manager of the Kuwait Oil Company, very kindly showed us round the oil fields at Burgan, the new camp at Ahmedi and Fahahil where the oil is piped on to tankers. Ahmedi is to be the oil company’s headquarters and is being planned on a grand scale. A few buildings have already been erected but it will take another 3 or 4 years at least to complete the programme. The houses are to be widely spaced and there is to be an adequate supply ot wat-i for gardens though as it is brackish it remains to be seen what trees and plants can be grown with it. A brief visit was paid to Failacha island where there is a population of about 1500 and some cultivation and on the return journey we spent two days at Basra where I had an opportunity of meeting the Consul-General and discussing some outstanding matters with an official of the Port Directorate. rt Ia ^ ' 7* The chief cause for anxiety at Kuwait is the super abundance of cash. The merchants made enormous profits mainly out of smuggling during the war and owing to the Oil Company’s present programme of very rapid expansion the demand foi labour greatly exceeds the supply. -^n ordiiiary labourer car; now demand Rs. 6/- to Rs. 7/- a day and with this state of affairs prices naturally remain at a high level and those with fixed incomes especially lower grades of Government servants find it very difficult to make both ends meet. The Shaikh is already receiving Rs. 5 lakhs a month in royalty and I am told that by the middle of next year this figure is likely to be trebled. Up to date however he has actually received very little in cash as production only started at the end of June 1946 and payment of royalty is made annually for the year ending 23rd September. The Shaikh apparently intends to keep the money derived from the royalty in his own hand and to distrioute it to departments as occasion arises. He says he does not intend to devote any of it to his privy purse. He still refuses to commit himself to a British financial adviser, and no doubt fears the criticism to which guch an appointment would give rise. Meanwhile there are signs of considerable progress in Kuwait. A new hospital is under construction which is to take 150 male patients and a site has bean set aside for a similar building to take 150 female patients. The customs pier is to be greatly extended, new warehouses are to be built and an approach 60 yards wide i s to be cleared through the town. While at Kuwait I inspected I f! / therla* 't? sho scliool ait next t roe mbs r a the hoys* achoola and roy wife went round the gi: Sduoation ia free for all the the Shaikh'a aonij the beggare. I waa very much impressed by the roembera dT the Egyptian Educational Mission and the good work they are doing in Kuwait. They are of course used aa a vehicle for Egyptian propaganda and possibly as a reault of their efforts the Arab intelligentsia of Kuwait ia beginning to look to Sgypt fo* it® inspiration more than waa the case in the past. It ia significant that Shaikh Ahmed has recently sent a present of 3 camels to Kin^ parouk* Aa at Bahrain I found that the elementary and primary Claeses were well attended but that there were very few boys in the eecondary claaaes. There are however 56 Kuwaiti boy a studying in Egypt. The Shaikh hopea in due courae to replace the Egyptian teachers v/i tb Ktroaitia but it remaina to be seen whether the boys who are now being educated will be willing to take up teaching aa a profession. I was told that practically all the boys studying in the seccn&amp;ary classes at Kuwait wish to be doctors. ^ jf . The Shaikh is auctioning his rights in oil in the Neutral Zone and the highest bidder at present is the ira^ Petroleum Company. Mr. Rhc^des of the Gulf Oil Company of America left Kuwait on the 18 th March and will probably return in due course to out-bid the Ira^i petroleum Company, It seems unlikely that any final decision will be reached for a few months. tfhile I waa at Kuwait the Shaikh received a telegram from Ibn Saud stating that the latter was permitting a survey by the Arabian American Oil Company of the coast of the Neutral zone. The Shaikh replied that he had no objection provided the survey was strictly limited to the coast. 9- Mr. Gott the Divisional Manager Cable and Wireless Persian Gulf has arrived in Kuwait to negotiate a concession with the Shaikh. His task is not likely to be an easy one as the Company does not enjoy a very good reputation in Kuwait• TRUCTAL COAST . (O' The Political Ofiicer Trucial Coast has been successful in bringing about a settlement between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. On the 6th of March both Shaikhs signed an agree- ment to abstain in future from all hostile acts against each other and to make no claims in respect of those commiti.ed in the past. This settlement has been joyfully received by the mercantile communities but it remains to be seen how long it will last. The death is reported of the Shaikha nausea wife of Shaikh Said of Dubai. She was a well-known character and is believed to have exercised considerable influence over her httifband. Shaikh Said has gone to Bakfcahto condole with his late wife’s relations. ' MUSCAT . //&lt; The Political Agent, Major Stewart, is in Dhofar with the Sultan and Negotiations for a civil air agreement and for facilities for the R.A.F. at Salalwh and Masirah are proceeding apace. Only a few comparatively minor points , axe now outstanding and it is hoped that negotiations will soon be successfully concluded. The Air officer Commanding Aden has been vis iting Salalah and Masirah to discuss with the Political Agent the future requirements of the R.A.F. at those places. it' Sir Cfrril Fox has returned to India after com pleting a geological survey of Dhofar. It ia underetdod that he has reported favourably regarding the presence of minerals including oil.- 4 - A Irans- i 1 XraBxasaiatxxsRljiixatiQii World ^iriwaye repretentativee visited Muscat at the beginning of the month.

During the month the Persian Gulf has been visited by the, C-in-C East Indies for the first time since 1938. Admiral and lady Paldiser arrived at Bahrain in H.M.S. 'GLASGOV.' on the 10th February and left immediately for Basra by air. They visited Kuwait in H.M.S. Glasgow from the 21st to the 24th February and Bahrain from the 25th to the 28th February. No visit was paid to Muscat owing to the absence of the Sultan. We are still without any local air service and representations on the subject have been received from ✓ * / the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Ltd. amongst others. BAHRAIN. The visit of the C-in-C East (4 0 * Indies was celebrated by a rfumber of parties, and amongfet other places Admiral and Lady Palliser visited the Bahrain Petroleum Company's refinery. Numerous oil ^agnates have been visiting Bahrain including : 'r.Pigott, President of the Standard Oil Company of California, and Mr. Nicholls, Vice President of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. They 4 have been taking advantage of what is known by the local oil people as 'Directors' weather'. His Highness Shaikh Salman continues to flog the Zubarah horse.

The occasion has not previously been celebrated with yr*eat eclat but this year an elaborate programme was arranged and special commemorative postage labels were distributed free of charge. The C-in-C hast Indies altered his programme so as to be presert for the occasion. The Shaikh has declined an invitation from His Majesty’s Government to visit the United Kingdom this year ost ensi bly because of the prese nt economic condition and indicated that he would like to be invited again next year. Me has announced his intention of paying a visit to Ibn Saud during March, possibly with the intention of discussing Neutral Zone Oil amongst other things. There are now several competitors for a concession for the Shaikh’s share in this oil but he has as yet given no indication whom he intends to favour. At one time during the month there were no less than seven cargo steamers in Kuwait harbour. Great difficulty was experienced in handling the cargo as landing arrangements are the monopoly of a local syndicate^ one of the products oT the fertile brain of the late Major Frank Holmes) which was inadequately equipped to deal with situation. Abdullah Khaza’al has written to the Persian Consul at Basra about his return to Persia and has received a reply that the Consul if} - itlng instructions from Tehran. X)n the 11th February the Egyptian teachers in Kuwait who style themselves the Egyptian Educational Mission gave an elaborate tea-party in honour of King Farouk's birthday.

MUSCAT . Major Stewart returned to Muscat from Bahrain on February 10th. It is expected that he will shortly leave for Dhofar for the conclusion of negotiations with the Sultan for the Civil Air Agreement, which it has been decided to proceed with, and for facilities for the Royal Navy at Khor Kuwai and for the Royal Air Force at Salalah and Masirah. The British Overseas Airways corporation have withdrawn from these two places and the Sultan has demanded that their buildings should be handed over to him. It is believed that the Royal Air Force have temporarily taken charge of them. Sir Cyril Fox one time Director Geological Survey India has arrived in Dhofar and has presumably by this time completed his survey. According to a message received from the Sultan, Trans'World Airways were proposing to send representatives to Muscat on the 1st March. * MARITIME . The Star of Mexi^ an Egyptian vessel and Egyptian manned cargo boat not equipped with v^ireless ran aground just south of Ras al T4 add, the south-eastern corner of Arabia, on or about the 1st February.

A few days later excited messages were received first that the crew of the Star of i.iexiB^ wanted to abandon ship owing to fear of local /rabs and later that about 800 armed Arabs were on board looting the vessel. The crew did abandon the vessel and were taken on board a westward bound tanker the 'British Destiny'. Major Stewart went to the spot in the H.M.I.S. 'Dhanush' and found that the|had been looted of everything that could be moved. The Y/ali of Sur T s account of the affair is that a small amount of cargo was safely unloaded and despatched to Muscat and the Master wishrng to expedite proceedings, against the • advice of the Wall, sent his crew ashore and called in local Arabs to assist in the unloading. It was not long before they got out of hand and looting became general. There is still a cargo of coal and iron sheeting aboard but there is no longer any hope of saving the vessel. vNotes for Registry % Under Secretary... Secretary of State Committee Under Secretary...

The following is a summary of events in the P&lt; GENERAL. The British Overseas Airways Corporation 1 'C' Class flying-boat service has been withdrawn without any ~Uv &gt;. % similar local service being established to take its place. The general public who expected an improvement in air services after the war rather than the reverse are complaining bitterly, and the Bahrain Government has sent in a strongly-worded letter on txie subject. The mercantile communities at Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast are particularly affected as they had become used to travelling to and from India by air and this mode of travel was especially convenient for the pearl trade. Steamer services are still very irregular and the voyage between Bahrain and Bombay takes anything up to a fortnight. A temporary arrange ment was made for a Lockheed aircraft employed on the Hadramaut route to visit Sharjah Le a week from Karachi but this has now 'ft ceased with the closing/down of the Hadramaut service. ,c£/ The Iraq Levies hitherto employed by the Royal Air Force at Bahrain and Sharjah for the protection of their property have been withdrawn and local guards are being used instead. No local reactions have yet been reported to the annoujicement that the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the Soco^y Vacuum Oil Company are to make large purchases of crude oil f rom the Anglo Iranian Oil Company. Events . E. P 0 Do^ialdson, Esquire, C.M.G. , India Office, London.page 2. t % i / Events In Palestine and India are watched with interest by the general public who naturally sympathise with their fellow Iiuhammadans in both countries. Their sympathies however are not 'iolently expressed and they appear to be thankful to be far from vhe scenes of turmoil and not to be involved in similar troubles themselves. Arrangements have been made to send the British Broadcasting Corporation a monthly newsletter from the Persian Calf for use in their Arabic transmission only. Major A. L. Greenway, M.B.E., Residency Surgeon, has proceeded on leave pending retirement. His place has been taken temporarily by Lieutenant M. L. A. Steele. BAHRAIN . A formal reception was held at the Residency on New Year's Day and was attended by His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad with other members of the A1 Khalifah and the leading representatives of the European and American communities. The opportunity was.taken to invest certain local officers with tne honours bestowed on them on the occasion of His Majesty the King's birthday. We have had a number of visitors at Bahrain during | the month. Sir Clarmont Skrine, Additional Counsellor, His 1 1 Majesty's Embassy, Tehran, stayed at the Residency for a few days at the beginning of the month and later Mr. Mundy, a Director of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company, and Mr. Anderson, a partner in Messrs, ^ackinnon, Mackenzie and Company, spent several days on the island. I had ^ long conversations with Mr. Mundy and Mr. Anderson on the subject of the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamer services in the Gulf, an early improvement in which has been promised. In fact it is reported that the first of the two new fast motor-boats which are to be employed on the Gulf service has already left the United Kingdom. Mr. Childs, the American Minister to Jeddah, paid a. very brief visit topage 3. Bahrain without giving us any previous'notice. He was » accompanied by Mr. Sullivan who describes himself as the American Oil Attache for the Middle East with his headquarters at Cairo and Mr. Bailey, the* new American Consul at Dhahran. Towards the end of the month an air-survey party led by Mr. Warcup visited the island and amongst other things inspected the proposed aerodrome site at Hamala. The British Council have kept the Bahrain Government waiting for so long for a Director of Education that the school year is now half over and the Bahrain Government have decided to do without the British Director who was supposed to be coming. Mr. Agar has backed out of his proposal to erect cotton mills at Bahrain ostensibly on account of the length of the negotiations. It has been learnt unofficially that Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited have at length decided to proceed with the scheme for the installation of an automatic telephone system. I KUWAIT . The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, paid an official visit on the 14th January and the usual calls we re exchanged. The Shaikh has been away for part of the month hawking. He is still unwilling to ask for a British Financial Adviser apparently from fear of being called a traitor to his country. The Revenue Department has produced its first budget or written statement of account. It shows that during last year expenditure exceeded revenue by Rs 83,000, but that there was a surplus of assets over liabilities of Ks 38,00,000. The total income was Rs 19,48,000. The Shaikh is experiencing further difficulties over his date-gardens in Iraq from the fact that his lawyers have now resigned. He has failed to obtain any of the produce of his gardens for the last four years and'a very large number of suits are pending. Mr. Rhoades of the Gulf Oil Company has arrived to compete for the Neutral Zone Oil Concession and has announced his intention of remaining in Kuwait till the matter is decided.. News has been received of the death in the ' United Kingdom ....United Kingdom of Majcr I rank Holmes a v/ell-known figure in the Gulf who has for some :ime now been assisting the Shaikh of Kuwait in oil matters. Abdullah son of the late Shaikh Khazaal of Muhammerah who has for some time been a refugee in Kuwait has been told that if he wishe to return to Persia he must get into touch with the Persian Consul at Basrah. QATAR . HP ^ in the month,accompanied by the Political Agent, Bahrain, I paid a i$it to Zubarah 'the place which has for so long been a bone of co. .tention between the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar. The whole place is deserted except for the fort built by the Shaikh of Qata^ a few years ago. This was occupied by two watchmen who refused uj admittance. Shaikh Salman is continuing to press for his 'rights' in Zubarah in season and out of season and has even gone so far as to prohibit the export of some lorries required by Petroleum Concessions Limited for their operations in Qatar. Petroleum Concessions Limited are beginning a programme of rapid expansion in Qatar, including the construction of new harbours and roads details of which are being communicated to Shaikh Abdullah. E.M.S. 'Challenger' is carrying out a marine survey along the east coast of Qatar. s TRUCIAL C QdST During the. month I toured the Trucial Coast accompanied by lol^i.e! and Mrs. Galloway and my daughter. All the Shaikhdons we~e v sited except Kalba and calls oxchanged with the Shaikhs. In adcition visits were paid to the island of Bu Musa, to Rams, Sha : am and Khatt in the Shaikhdom of Ras al Khaimah and to Bakhah. Cenerally speaking the supply situation is satisfactory in all places and there is no political trouble apart from the Abu Dhaai -&gt; Dubai feud and the Ras al Khaimah family squabble. At Bu Musa we visited the red oxide workings which are in charge, of Mr Pocock of the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company Limited, wl: is living on the island with his wife and two children. Last Spring 4,000 tons of the mineral were exported ^ne several mines are now being worked. The occurrence cf the mineral .• .. ' c V?&gt; page 5. of the mineral is spasmodic and so far as is known there are no large reserves. Bakhah is the headquarters of Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad of the Shihuh who claims jurisdiction over five or six villages on this part of the coast. He a; pears to be completely independent of the Sultan of Muscat and is supplied with rations from the Trucial Coast. The population is mixed Arab and Persian and makes its living by trade and sea-fari: g. Although so far as is known no political .officer has previously visited Bakhah and no steamer has touched at the port for seven years, our appearance aroused little interest. The enmity between Abu Dhabi and Dubai occasioned what might have been a very serious incident on the evening we left Abu-Dhabi. Mr. Jackson, the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and the Residency Agent were driving back from Abu Dhabi to Sharjah after dark and about five miles from Dubai were fired at by a servant of Shaikh Juma of Dubai who with others was keeping watch for a possible incursion from the Abu Dhabi direction The bullet went through the wind-screen of the truck and both Mr. Jackson and the Residency Agent were slightly injured by glass splinters. When we visited Dubai a few dtys later Shaikh Said undertook to provide a new truck and to expel his brother Shaikh Juma, who is behind much of the trouble between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, until further notice. Juma has arrived in Bahrain where he is to reside for the time being. At Ras al Khaimah Shaikh Sultan bin Salim asked for Government intervention to bring about a settlement with his brother. The trouble is largely due to the failure of Shaikh Sultan to give his brother a share of the oil payments. The brother with his six sons is at present living in tne date gardens some miles distant from Ras al Khaimah and wishes to return to the town. This Shaikh Sultan will not permit as / he has good reason to fear that his brother will kill him. . The Shaikh now offers to make a settlement witu his brother and allow him to return if Government will undertake responsibility for his keeping the peace, which is of course out of the question. At Char j ah we visited the Royal Air Force car. a part of which is now emptyKjiflg owing to ....emptyJttg. owing to the withdrawal of the Iraq Levies. . Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr is demanding rent for the area occupied by the ^ Royal Air Force to whom he only granted facilities free of charge for the duration of the war. did not meet the Petroleum Concessions Limited survey party which is busy out in the desert about twenty five miles from Abu Dhabi. At Dubai we paid a visit to the recently established branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran. The Manager reports that the local people are slow in taking advantage of the facilities offered by the bank, though I gather that the head office are quite satisfied with the progress made by the ^ranch up to date, and also told us that he has been informed by some authority in the United Kingdom that Dubai is not in the sterling area — a matter which I am taking up separately. MUSCAT . With the Sultan in Dhofar there is little to report at Muscat itself. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, paid the port an official visit on the 7th January and the usual cal.ls were exchanged. In Dhofar the Sultan according to his own telegraphic report has had a satisfactory meeting with Mr. Altouniya.i 'of Pettroleum Concessions Limited. Sir Cyril Fox is shortly expected \there to carry out a geological survey of the Province. It is now proposed not to proceed further with negotiations for a civil air agr-eer ent and the British Overseas Airways Corporation are with- x • drawing from Salalah and Masirah and closing down the Karachi-Aden i service. The Sultan’s reactions to this development are not yet known but he can hardly fail to be greatly disappointed. The Air Officer Commanding, Aden, paid him a visit during the month and discussed with him some local Royal Ai^* Force problems. The American air-line Trans World Airways asked the Sultan if they could send a representative by air to Muscat on the 7th January to inter- view him. The Sultan replied that they could send a representative but that he would be away, and instructed his officials to ascertain what the object of the visit was. No representative however appeared presumably due to the absence of the Sultan. Major Stewart, Political Agent, Muscat, joined me at Sharjah during my Trucial Coast tour and • • t •U page 7. Coast tour and is now staying with me in Bahrain.' He travelled by truck from Muscat to Sharjah and performed the journey in three days. MISCELLANEOU S . Ibn Saud camped for a few days at Dhahran during the latter half' of January. The Shaikh of Bahrain visited him accompanied by Mr. Belgrave and a large retinue and spent two nights in his camp. Yours sincerely, Sd. W. R. HAY. / %o CpNFIPENTIAL D.O. Ivo, 58 - S # PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, f BAHRAIN. the 8 th January, 1947. i The following is a summary of events in the Persian Gulf Residency of December, 1946. 2 . GENERAL . The British Overseas Airways Corporation propose to withdraw the ‘C* Class flying boat service which links Karachi, Dubai, Bahrain, Basra and Cairo, with effect from the 10th January. This set-back in air communications in the Gulf will seriously affect both official and commercial classes and in particular will make it much more difficult for the Political Agent, Bahrain, effectively to control the Trucial Coast. 3 The Middle East Office, Cairo, has complained of delays on the part of the Sheikhdoms and Muscat in taking delivery of their wheat and suggested reductions in their quotas. These delays appear to be partly due to lack of shipping space and partly, so it is alleged, to the failure of the Ministry of Food to indicate in good time to their local agents the sources from which deliveries are to be made. So long as these conditions exist there will inevitably be a time-lag of three or four months in the taking of delivery by the Gulf States. Mr. Jerath E. P. Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., India Office, London.page 2 . / Ly Mr. Jerath, Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Baluchistan Sind, has been inspecting the Indian Post Offices in the Gulf which are also under his charge. Generally speaking the accommodation provided for these Post Offices is extremely poor and the staff are underpaid. It is hoped that his visit v/ill result in some amelioration of existing conditions. V BAHRAIN . His Highness, apart from some local hunting excursions, has spent the month at Pdfaa. His main interest continues to be Zubarah and during the month he wrote to the Political Agent complaining that the Shaikh of Qatar had permitted certain of his subjects who have absconded from Bahrain to settle in n our State Zubarah'. The letter was returned to him to be presented in a more suitable form. £ A successful race-meeting was held at the end of November and December has produced a round of parties. British, American, Indian and Australian consumer goods are becoming more readily available in the bazaar though there / are still many shortages. The supply of foodstuffs is generally speaking adequate. The State is carrying out some repairs at a very slow pace &lt;jn a small stretch of the Awali road and Mr. Reid of Messrs. Holloway Brothers has been on a visit to Bahrain as a preliminary to the installation of a new water-supply in Manamah, for which wells are already being sunk. The automatic telephone exchange project is still under correspondence with Messrs. Cable and Wireless. Mr. Agar of Persian origin but a naturalised British subject and previously the owner of cotton mills at Bushire has 9 reached an agreement with the State authorities regarding the erection of cotton mills at Manamah. A company is to be farmed • • o 0page 3. formed with a capital of Rs 30,00,000 half of which will be contributed by Mr. Agar himself. Towards the end of November Sir Henry Holland of the Church Missionary Society, Quetta, visited Bahrain for a week. He came primarily to operate on a son of Shaikh Khalifah for cataract, but per formed numerous other eye operations and amongst others, treated a son of His Highness Shaikh Salman. 7 KUWAIT . There have been no further developments regarding the Neutral Zone oil concession except that infor mation has been received that Mr. Rhodes of the Gulf Oil Company is shortly expected in Kuwait to make a bid for it. The Shaikh has now intervened on behalf of Abdullah Khazaal and asked that he may either be given an allowance or allowed to go where he likes. No reply has yet been received from the Persian Government regarding the conditions on which he may be allowed to return to Persia. Good rain has fallen \ over most of Kuwait territory. S' TRUCIAL COAST . There is little fresh news from the Trucial Coast. The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah is still at loggerheads with his relations in spite of the efforts of the Shaikh of Sharjah to make peace between them. The situation as between Dubai and Abu Dhabi remains as it was, though there have been no fresh incidents of importance. The leading Shaikh of the Naim at Baraimi has recently put out the eyes of three of his relatives who he believed were conspiring to usurp his position. MUSCAT . During the period under report I visited Muscat, Gwadur, the Batinah Coast and Khor Kuwai. As the ’Nearchus 1 was undergoing repairs I travelled in the 'King Faisal” which used to be the Duke of Sutherland’s yacht but was purchased • • • •page 4 was purchased before the war by the Iraq Government and is now generally employed on the pilot station at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab. \o At Muscat I had two interviews with the Sultan and also received him on board the 'King Faisal” which he inspected. I found him in very good health and full of ideas about the proposed new Civil Air Agreement which the Political Agent and myself spent much time in discussing with him. His attitude was on the whole very reasonable especially as regards the main proposals but he raised a multitude of small points* He is naturally anxious to maintain the dignity of Muscat as a sovereign State and also to obtain as many perquisites as possible for himself, &gt; Shortly after my visit he left for Dhofar which he proposed to make his headquarters at any rate till next October. He has announced his intention of paying a private visit to India if possible in March in order, amongst other things, to see a dentist. During his absence from Muscat he has arranged that his uncle Saiyid Shahab should, be in charge for ceremonial purposes but that the actual administration should be in charge of his Minister of the Interior Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim. He may in due course be willing to entrust the conduct of affairs to Captain Hudson who has recently relieved Major Hirst as his Military Adviser, \ »» Muscat is the most backward of the more important Gulf States and as yet shows few signs of progress. The Sultan has placed his brother Saiyid Tariq, who recently underwent two or three years’ training in India, in charge of the Municipalities of Muscat and Matrah and though he takes an interest in his work and is reasonably energetic, lack of funds and age-long prejudice stand in the way of the drastic clean-updrastic clean-up that is required. The Matrah bazaars in particular are narrow and dirty. The Khojahs who form the most important part/of the population live in an insanitary keep which is a maze of dark, unhealthy lanes. Haji Baqir’s fish-meal factory does not improve the amenities of the place/ It is lying idle at present but should soon be vorking again with new machinery ordered from India. The only bright spot at Matrah is the well known American Mission Hospital in charge of Dr. and Mrs. Thoms who do sterling work amongst the local people and the Arabs,.of Oman. A water survey of Muscat and Matrah as well as the Batinah Coast has recently been carried out by Mr. Williamson of Petroleum Concessions Limited. His report is not very encouraging but if his recommendations are given effect to they should result in a substantial increase in the supply of drinking water for Muscat and Matrah which is now in a parlous state as the result of two years without rain. \ j98H Major A. C. Stewart took over as Political Agent, Muscat, on the 30th November and Mr. and Mrs. Hallows left for England the following day. •3 At Gwadur I spent the best part of two days and visited amongst other things the old aerodrome which is situated some eight miles from the town and the Portuguese dam on top of the promontory. I met the local trading community and was given a tea-party by the Agakhanis, who number nearly 400 souls here and one and all went to Bombay recently for His Highness the Aga Khan r s Diamond Jubilee. Tl^e main complaint of the trading classes related to the poor telegraphic and postal communications. I have taken up this matter with the Director of Posts and Telegraphs at Karachi and I understand there has already been an improvement. The wheat supply • • • •page 6. i * The wheat supply appears to be sufficient though not liberal but there is a demand for broken rice which is the staple food of the fisher-folk on the Mekran Coast. The Sultan is fnxious to improve the administration of Gwadur and some months ago one Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy was appointed for this • i purpose. He proved however too old and had to be invalided out in October last^ by which time he had done nothing beyond carrying out a few improvements to his own residence. Mr, Abdur Rahman whose services have kindly been lent by the Baluchistan Administration has now arrived to take his place. i • I travelled along the Batinah Coast by car visiting most of the Sultan’s Walis en route. The date harvest has been good, supplies are generally speaking adequate and lav/ and oider prevail. At Saham I visited the American Missionary doctor Miss Hosman who, with her assistant Miss Barter, lives and works in a collection of palm-frond huts on the beach. ■r While I was at Muscat the Sultan raised the question cf the future of the additional buildings erected by the Royal Navy during the War at Khor Kuwai, and during my return journey in the ’’King Faisal” I called in at the' place. There are many more buildings than when I was last there in January 1942 and I am obtaining derails regarding them before pursuing the matter further. MARXTIME. H.M.S. ”Challenger” is busy carrying out a survey along the Qatar Coast. A light-float has now been placed on Cable Bank and a light-buoy on Shah Allam Shoal where two American, tankers went aground during 1946. The • \ light-ship on Stiffe lank is to remain in sit u. The Shaikh of Kuwait • • • •* page 7. of Kuwait has given his formal consent to the erection of a light beacon on Farsi Island. Bed Oxide operations have begun again on Bu Musa under the superintendence of Lieutenant- Commander Pockock (representing the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company, Limited) who is living on the island with his wife and two children. \ 17 MIS C ELLANEOUS . Ibn Baud is now expected to pay a brief visit to Dammam in the first half of January. Shaikh Salman had proposed sending him an invitation to visit Bahrain but now intends to write and suggest that he should himself visit Ibn Saud on the mainland. G. A. M. /CONFIDENTIAL D. 0.

No separate Summary was forwarded for October owing to my absence in London. f • 1/ $S- J GBIERAL . I was absent from Bahrain on deputation to the United Kingdom from the 3rd October to the 14th November/. During rny absence Lieutenant Colonel A. C. Galloway, C.I.E.j 0..b.E., acted as Political Resident. ] Thanks in great part to the excellent arrangements made by the British Supply Mission at Cairo the supply of food grains to the Gulf States has for the past year or two given no cause for anxiety. It is understood that the Supply Mission is shortly to close down and if after this the Gulf States are -left to make their own arrangements for the supply of grain a serious situation is likely to arise. In spite of warnings all the Gulf States, except Kuwait, have refused to accept some surplus flour belonging to the British Military authori- ties in Iraq which was offered them by the British Supply Mission. Samples of this flour received by them have been reported to be already unfit for local consumption and there is no doubt that there would be further rapid deterioration under local storage conditions. The Kuwait authorities have perhaps accepted this flour with the idea of disposing of it to local Bedouin who are not particular about what they eat. Major Sinclair, Telecommunications Attache, Middle East, visited Bahrain during October and discussed various local problems, amongst them the refusal of Cable and tireless to instal an automatic telephone system. This refusal has come as a great disappointment to the Shaikh and to all telephone users in the Island whom the defects of the present system and, in particular, the stupidity of the Arab operators . r -iry e desperation. The Shaikh* s feelings on the Subject are particularly strong because his Government are continually being urged by us to improve the amenities of the isiand and because Kuwait has long had an automatic system. that Cable and Wireless may be induced to re-consider their decision. * T &amp; e ^ ahr ain Government have given to Messrs. Holloway Brothers a contract for installing a new water supply system in Manamah. This will fill a long-felt need and it is hoped tnat no undue delay will occur in the execution of the work. N f Mr. Hanna. Vice-President of the Bahrain Petroleum Company is on a visit to Bahrain of some duration. Mr. Davies, resiaent of the Arabian American Oil Company has recently paid a visit to the Island from Dhahran. The Bahrain Petroleum short ly starting drilling operations in the vicinity of the Portuguese Fort on the north coast of the Island. ^ The pearling season .... E. P. Donaldson, India Office London. Esquire, C.M.G., 9 t /{ t page 2. f 7 5 • . • The pearling season closed on the 23rd October, a strong north wind having forced the fleet to return to Bahrain a day earlier than usual* The highest pfcice$ ; cktoh ' for a single boat was sold for the equivalent of!about ^ £ 8 , 000 . ' \ } $ KUWAIT . Major Tandy, the Political Agent, attended ^ the P.I.C*A.O. Conference at Cairo during the first half of the month and returned to Kuwait on the 19th October, ? The Shaikh, after consulting His Majesty*s Govern ment, has let it be knov/n that he is willing to receive offfers for his share of the oil rights in the Kuwait Neutral Zone and has intimated that he will probably accept the highest bidder. He has promised to make no agreement without first consulting His Majesty*s Government. General Pyron of the Gulf Oil Company visited Kuwait early in October but the Shaikh states that he refused to discuss the Neutral Zone with him as he had not at that time received any reply to his approach to His Majesty*s Government. Since then Messrs. Skliros, Wheatley and Lermitte have notified him during a personal visit that the Iraq Petroleum Company wish to compete for the concession and been favourably received by him. ^ Abdullah Khazal has continued to pester the Political Agent with requests for a subsistence allowance or permission, to leave. A reply is awaited from His Majesty*s Ambassador, Tehran, regarding the reception he is likely to be accorded if he retin*ns openly to Persia. Meanwhile the Political Agent is being instructed to tell Abdullah if necessary that he must take his requests to the Shaikh whose protection he sought when he fled to Kuwait. U Litigation over the Shaikh* s date gardens in Iraq continues. Over 2,000 appeals from tenants are pending against the Land Settlement Officers decision that the gardens belong to the Shaikh. Meanwhile the Iraqi Courts have cancel led certain attachment orders designed to prevent the removal v by the tenants of the Shaikh* s share of the produce which means that the Shaikh will lose his entire income from the gardens for the harvests concerned. Fifty two destitute Indian Shiah pilgrims returning from Iraq have recently been repatriated by sea from Kuwait after having been maintained there at Government expense for several weeks. QATAR . Lieutenant Colonel Galloway, while acting as Political Resident, visited Qatar during October in H.M.S. n Loch Quoich 11 and discussed the Zubarah question amongst others with Shaikh Abdullah. ^ Petroleum Concessions, Limited, are about to carry out an aerial survey of Qatar peninsula. They have been warned to avoid as far as possible too close an approach to the disputed Saudi Arabian boundary in the south. The Company will shortly have their own aircraft at Bahrain and the Shaikh of Qatar has agreed to their landing in the Qatar peninsula as occasion demands without obtaining his prior permission „ in each case. TRUCIAL COAST . The quarrel between Abu Dhabi and Dubai still continues with the latter inciting the powerful tribe of the Beni Qitab to overt acts against Abu Dhabi. The chief of the Beni Qitab has told the Residency Agent that he has promised the Shaikh of Dubai not to make a separate peace with Abu. Dhabi. There have been • • • •page 3. // There have been no further hostilities at Has al Khaimah and the Shaikh of Sharjah is intervening to settle the dispute. '7 Petroleum Concessions, Limited’s geo-physicist party is now at work in the Abu Dhabi coastal area. ^ MUSCAT . The Sultan is expected to leave for 'Dhofar about the 15th December and the Anglo Iranian Oil Company have kindly arranged to transport him by tanker. The health of the Political Agent, Mr. Hallows, has been giving cause for anxiety and he and his wife will probably be leaving for the United Kingdom about the 1 st December in a tanker which the Anglo Iranian Oil Company are very kindlji making available. The new Political Agent, Major Stewart, is expected to reach Muscat early in December. Captain Hudson, the Assistant Political Agent, will act as Political Agent in the meanwhile. U Memories of France’s diplomatic activity at Mus cat in the early years of this century were recalled by the demarche of M. Berthelot, the French Consul at Bombay who, while describing himself as 'Consul for France at Muscat' proposed to the Sultan and the Political Agent that he snould visit Muscat officially in the French Navy vessel 'Var'. The Political Agent conveyed the Sultan’s reply to M. Gerthelot that His Highness was ready to receive him informally only, as he had received no official intimation of M. .Berthelot 1 s consular position in Muscat. M. Berthe lot expressed polite surprise but called the trip off. ^ The 'Dahpu' (mentioned in my September letter) was tov/ed from Muscat harbour early in October and sunk in deep water. The Sultan expressed his appreciation of the bearing and conduct of the salvage party in extremely trying conditions. The Sultan has stated privately that he has no objection to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, making their own arrangements with the tribes concerned for oil exploration south of Baraimi in the Dhank and Ibri area provideo. his name is not brought into the matter in any way. It is understood that the Company do not intend to undertake any exploration in this area this cold weather. Tne Sultan in spite of his anxiety for the Company to undertake oil exploration in Dhofar is rather vague about the limits within which he can accept responsitality for tneir safety. It is hoped that the matter will be discus- sed by him with a representative of the Company at Dhofar in the near future. The Sultan has asked for the services of a geologist not connected with the Company to undertake a general survey of Dhofar. ^ Negotiations have been initiated with the sultan for a new Civil Air Agreement and for the grant of certain facilities in his territory for the Royal Air Force. Ihe present enjoyment of such facilities is dependent on the payment of a war subsidy which is due to cease on the 31st December next. lLy MlSCbl LANEOUS . Mr. Parked T. Hart has handed over as American Consul at Dhahran to Mr. Bailey. Hr. Hart represented his country, so far as is known informally, in Muscat and also took an interest in Bahrain. I found' him co-operative and no^t unduly inquisitive or interfering. I have not yet met his successor who is a man of fifty. It is stated that • • • •\ i xz Y -4 ~lC 9 ^ / page 4. 2X It is stated that Ibn Saud intends to visit ■&amp;h£ah]r&amp;n during the next few months. It is not yet known whether the Shaikh will invite him to Bahrain. 4F_ ^ The American Arabian Oil Company intend to buTld a causeway seven miles long running into the sea north-east of Dammam with berths for two ocean-going vessels. There will be standard gauge railway from the wharf to Dhahran. The work is expected to be completed in twenty months* time. It seems .(inevitable that Bahrain's transit trade will be adversely ^/affected by this project. There is some idea of eventually extending the railway to Riyadh. ?7 Mr. Croning, till recently Under Secretary to this Residency, has recently had a stroke while on leave in India and it is not known whether he will be able to return to the Gulf. He had an unrivalled knowledge of the Residency records and has rendered invaluable assistance to successive Political Resident*s over a long number of years. 7&lt;f Some anxiety was felt for the families of the Consul, Bushire, and the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, .who as a result of the tribal disturbances, were marooned in Shiraz where they had gone for part of the hot weather. This was relieved when they were evacuated, under tribal auspices, on the 14th October by road to Bushire.

GBIERAL . Nothing of outstanding importance^ has occurred on the Arab side of the Gulf. ^The tribal rising in Pars is being watched with great interest in Bahrain where it is hoped that if the tribes succeed in establishing themselves fewer restrictions will be placed on trade between Bahrain and Pars. BAHRAIN . I have had two interviews with the Shaikh, in the first of which I endeavoured to persuade him to spend more money on improvements in Bahrain but he insisted on talking most of the time about Zubarah. In the second interview I.gave him an opportunity of stating fully his grievances about Zubarah. His immediate cause of complaint is the annoyance to which he alleges Bahrainis are subjected when they visit Zubarah. The pearling season is reported to be/particularly good one but unfortunately events in India have led to a drop in prices. The Bahrain Government have issued a law regulating rents end leases. The provisions of this measure do not apply to shop rents which have risen by as much as 150 to 200 $ in some cases in consequence. KUNA IT . The Political Agent returned from recess towards the end of the month. He approached the Shaikh on the subject of oil exploration in the Neutral Zone and the Shaikh assured him that he still bore in mind the promise he had given to Petroleum Concessions Limited and that he had given no encouragement to any other company. According to a report received from India I 6 Indian employees of the Kuwait Oil Company have been /(I dismissed for engaging in agitation similar to that^ / which has been taking place at Abadan. The matter is being enquired into. TBUCIAL COAST . The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah has been more or less besieged by his relatives who are endeavouring to depose him. There has been some firing but no serious breach of the peace. Bndeavours are being made to effect a settlement between the parties. There is no improvement in the relations between the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. MUSCAT . I paid a visit to Muscat by sea in the u Nearchus n arriving on the 14th September and leaving on the 16th. I found the Sultan in good health. He does not now propose to leave for Dhofar until the middle of December. I communicated to the Sultan HisI r* i' • i C' 'J o u - p - Majesty* s Government * ^ -do o io ion request for the assistance of the R.A.F, in his scheme to subjugate Oman and also discussed future oil exploration with him. He took H.L.G’s decision very calmly but remarked it would necessitate his abandoning' his scheme for the subjugation of Oman by force. He promised to consider the suggestions about oil exploration but meanwhile information has been received from the Petroleum Concessions Limited that they do not propose to.carry out any oil exploration in Muscat territory during the coming cold wea.ther. At a separate interview tne wultan complained about the failure of the Petroleum Concessions Limited to take any action under their concession in Dhofar, and suggested that if they were.not interested in the area they should allow him to negotiate with some other company. During my stay I visited the Levy lines_ at Bait al Falaj. The Military Adviser hac. not returned from recess and I was struck by tne general state oi somnolence that pervaded the place. This however was not surprising on a hot summer afternoon. Salvage operations to dispose of the '’Dahpu” which was sunk in Muscat harbour in 1943 have been in progress since May. One salvage vessel and two lifting craft have been employed and the British crews have had very severe climatic conditions to contend with. There was much sickness to begin.with but they are in better health now. They succeeded in lilting the n Dahpu n on the 12th September ano. propose to tow her out of the harbour and sink her in deep water. It is hoped that operations will be completed very shortly. The Imperial Bank of Iran have now.reconsidered tneir decision not to send a representative to Muscat and nope to be able to send one next spring. ^The Sultan has agreed to extend the option he gave them till tnat time, rnan Bahadur Abdul Haiy the Administrator of Gwadur who is over 60 years of age has been unable to stay^tne course and has returned to India owing to ill-health. It is hoped to obtain a successor from Baluchistan. tjarttTHE . In the course of my voyages to^Muscat and back I visited the lighthouses at Quoin and Tamb^ Islands. I found that at Iamb Island the ‘Shaikh of Rc.s al Khaimah* s flag was not hoisted on the n Nearchus ^ arrival as should have been done and sent a man to hoist it. IISC^LLAHLGUB . The Secretary to the Political^ Resident and the bulk of the Residency staff which had been left in Bushire arrived in Bahrain on.the 20th September. One or two clerks and some families still ^ remain in Persia.■ Accommodation for the Residency staff in the Naval Base at Jufair is still far from sacisxactory and the necessary financial sanction has.not been receivea to enable alterations and additions required to oe cameo, out. Major Tandy, Political Agent, Kuwait, nas seen deputed to the P.I.C.A.O. Conference at Cairo to aovise the British representatives regarding Gulf interests. The Sultan of Muscat received his invitation to be ^ represented at the Conference very late^ and has as^eo. tnat the British delegation should speak on his behalf. / / Considerationrs The new series of monthly letters -wdiich the Political Resident proposes seems a useful innovation. The Political Agency Intelligence Summaries tend to be a little disjointed and scrappy, and they are often veiy late in receipt. A draft letter to the Political. Resident comnenting on the suggested distribution is attached, together with drafts to the Foreign Office and Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power. It might also be worth while our sending copies of the summary to the Colonial Office, though we have not hitherto been accustomed to send them copies of papers about the Persian Gulf. &lt;TU.

I have sent you my first Monthly Letter and should be glad to know whether you have any suggestions or criticisms to make. I am afraid it is less conversational than I had originally intended it to be and is more in the nature of a disjointed Intelligence Summary. I should be glad to know whether you would prefer a private and confidential letter for your own and weightman's consumption only or a summary on the present lines which can oe dis tributed to Embassies, Legations, Intelligence Centres etc. Personally I am in favour of something which can be dis tributed fairly widely. At present only the Agency summaries are distributed and these are not sufficiently comprehensive and owing to the absence of officers on recess or tour and bad communications often arrive very late.

RHX.FILE COPY. &amp; Persian Cxulf Residency, Bahrain, the 4th September 194 6, h The following is a summary of events in the Persian Gulf Residency for August. GRlGRAh. The month has coincided more or less with that of Ramadhan and the Gulf States have for the most part remained in a state of torpor, (z) Up to date there has been no sign of the trouble experienced by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Iraq Petroleum Company spreading to any of the oil companies operating in the Gulf Shaikhdoms. BAHRAIN . His Highness the Shaikh was in good form though he looked rather tired when I visited him on the Id (August 23th) . 'Ho less than 56 tankers put in at Sitra during the month and a record amount of oil amounting to nearly million barrels was exported. H.M.3. '’Norfolk' was anchordd off^-Sitra during most of the month but has now left the Gulf, (On the 31st August the United States Ambassador at Tehran paid a few hours* visit to Bahrain, in the course of conversation he told me that in an interview with the Persian Prime Minister the question of the Persian claim to Bahrain had cropped up and that ^awam had shown him /the original of the letter addressed to the Persian Government in 1369 vide page 896 of Lorimer vol. 1 and stated that it was mainly on this letter that Persia based her claim. The Prime Minister added that at present he did not propose to pursue the claim with the united nations Organisation or the international Court of Justice as he thought it was unlikely to succeed owing to the strength 3f British influence in these bodies P- On the 23th July the first murder occurred (£n'rahrain ior 9 years. KUWA IT. Some months ago Abdullah, son of the late Shaikh Khasal of Mohammerah, took refuge in Kuwait after an abortive raid into Persian territory. During the month the B.B.C. announced that he was in Baghdad on his way to Cairo to represent the cause of the Arabs of Khuzistan to the Arab League. it was found that this report was entirely false, as Abdullah had never left Kuwait. Considerable trouble is being caused over a consignment of 2800 bags of sugar which the Government of India permitted to be despatched to Dubai via Kuwait, an over-carry of nearly 1200 miles. This sugar is still in Kuwait where the consignee is trying to sell it for re-export at an exorbitant price. TRUGIaL C0A3T . Although the affair between the Ghaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dubai arising out of the raid on Khor Ghanadah and the subsequent seizure by Dubai of a number of Abu Dhabi camels has been settled there is still consider able ill-feeling. between the two Rulers. There have been a number of affrays between the Beni ^itab and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi*s. s upporters in the vicinity of Buraimi and the Shaikh of Dubai has been openly encouraging the Beni o^itab. In fact a number of Dubai Arabs actually participated in one of these affrays and lost 9 killed and 5 injured, as well as 125 camels. The Shaikh of Dubai has protested to the Residency Agent and has been advised that his best course is to cease interfering between the Beni Q,itab and Abu Dhabi.Muscat , (n In June tiue Sultgtn purchased a considerable ajnount of i^nerican property at oalalah ano I^asirah i roin tiie Merican Disposals Board at Cairo. This ^property was never delivered to the Sultan out when the itinerican personnel lef ^ Salalaii they handed it over to the R.A*^. who have since been using it. The Sultan has accordingly refused to pay for the property and is insisting that it should oe delivered to him or his representative personally and its value re assessed after inspect ion. (^ ! iSarly in the month the Sultan sent 25 aimed men in a Charbar dhow to relieve his garrison at Gwadur. The dhow stopped at Charbar on the way and the Sultan 1 s men were arrested and the cargo of the dhow seized. It is understood that the men and cargo have now been released, h^n arrangement had been made for a representative of the 7 Imperial Bank of Iran to visit Muscat in the autumn to consider the possibility of opening a branch therj and the Sultan undertook to give the Bank an option until October. Bank have now decided that the commercial prospects of Muscat are not sufficiently attractive, and no longer intend to • send a representative there. MARITIME* Ror the second time in four months an American tanker has run aground on the Shah All urn Shoal which is situated in the middle of the Gulf due east of Bahrain and is reported to be an isolated pinnacle of rock. On this occasion the tanker was refloated after jettisoning a certain amount of her cargo and proceeded under her own steam. MISC.SLLAfc.BOUS . During the month final orders were received for the transfer of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrain. On the 19th August I moved into what used to be the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf’s residence at Jufair and my camp office moved into the Naval office. Staff and records are being brought across gradually from Bushire. Plans and estimates for necessary alterations in Hie buildings at the Naval Base are under preparation but it will tafce a few months to carry out the work and complete the move of the staff. Considerable delay has been caused by the fact that the Executive Engineer supplied by the Government of India went into hospital with typhoid the day after his arrival. In the first half of the month I paid a visit to the Bushire anchorage in order to discuss details of the move with members of the Residency staff there and to bring away records and equipment. During the month I paid a private visit of 3 days r duration to Aramco f s camp on the mainland at Dha'nran where I was most hospitably entertained. I was shown the new refinery at Has Tanura and the oilfield at Abqaiq. 1 cal-ed on the Amir Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi at 11.30 p.m. on the day of my arrival, it being Ramadhan, and was invited to dinner on the following night. Major General Robinson of the Air Ministry paid me a visit during the month and discussed the relief of the Iraq levies at present employed by the R.A.P. at Bahrain and Sharjah and of the Aden levies at Masirah.
