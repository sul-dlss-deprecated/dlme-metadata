Zahidan was considerably exercised oy the German reports published in the Iranian press that no fewer than 115 nritisn ships have been sunk since tne outbreak of war.

If you agree generally, you may think it worth while to take the matter up with the Minister at Tehran and suggest to him that the Consul’s reports contemplated in paragraph 2 of the Minister’s circular of 14th September (vide enclosures to India Office letter P.Z. 6056/37 of the 4th October, copy sent to the Director of Military Intelligence on 13th October) should cover the points suggested by Tod in his letter, lay, Esq., 1/2 .

Wilkin son, who has worked for many years j.n this country with the .American Archaeological Expedition and has latterly been working at Hishapur, in describing the attitude of Iranians towards the war said, and I think correctly, that in general they laboured under a sense of grievance agaipst the great powers for being so unmindful of the interests of Iran as to upset her economic life by their stupid indulgence in the luxury of war. Germany, in spite of her shameless pact with the arch-enemy Bussia, was less to blame than Britain, who is directly responsible for the damage caused to Iranian interests by the closing of her sea Dome trade with Europe (i.e. Germany), and so evincing tfce same domineering arrogance which she has always displayed, and especially to Iran, in the past. o* The same evening I received a visit from a Polish journalist, Laskowsmi (para 162 of political diary lor June 1939) and &amp; Prench companion named Bardel(?). j.hey had travelled from Tehran to Meshed via Gurgan and ^ujnurd in order to ascertain if possible what truth, ^ £ny, there was in the persistent rumours of Bussian troops concentrating on the northern borders of Iran. ac regiments are said to have recently been moved to ^ £ r ?f e h-- + y T rail p 70 ® asnovodgk.)

But a further rise as a result of the melting snows is anticipated in early June and the situation will be aggravated by the tt sad o hist ruz' wind which greatly increases the danger of breaches in earthworks. One such breach has already occurred 4 miles north of zabul resulting in the destruction of yet another village. The Bhela river itself is now overflowing and there are no less than three separate flooded areas to be negotiated on the main road to Zahidan. The ferry and lorry arrangements are very haphazard, and on one stretch of about 12 miles only pack transport is available. The telegraph line to Xx Zahidan is interrupted though that to Meshed is still open. Ool. Mukri, the Governor General, succeeded in getting into Zabul on the 16th May by boat, camel and motor and returned on the 21st. Supply arrangements in Zabul are not very good but shortages of various necessities appear to be only temporary. 112.

Mails between Meshed and Zahid&amp;n have been most irregular, but this is due not so much to bad weather and damaged roads as to the fact that the mail contractor is on the verge of bankruptcy and his lorries are not fit to be on the roads at all. One mail recently took 14 days to get from fjeshed to Sihidan instead of the usual 3. 120. Motor buses are now beginning to run through from Quetta to Zahidan or on to ^eshed and vice versa.

It is ironical that Iran which hts been continually complaining of the inadequacy of its share of the Helmand water should this year oe faced wiih such t problem. The local situation is aggravated by the existence of a large bridge on the 3ibul-^&amp;hidan road 5 miles south of 2ebul which in recent years has bean const, uc ted over the main overflow channel of Uist&amp;n *s share of the Helmand waters Known locally &amp;s the Mourab. This bridge will not pass the present flood water which on the upper side is already some 2 feet higher than the level of the surrounding country. In their efforts to save the oriage and with it 38bul # s communications with the outside world, the authorit.es have let more water into the subsidiary canals than they can contain, and as a result every day brings fresh reports of burst banks ana widespread inundations. The whole countryside hes oeen mobilised to strengthen the banks of the main c-' rials ana there is still a h.pe that the present flood water may subside before the full spring floods arising from the melting snows arrives. If they do not, Sis Can, and with it the town of abul,is likely to be faced with disaster* Floods have already reached to within a mile of the town and the troops are tidying to save their new barracks. Whether steps will be taken in time to save the rest of the town remain5 to be seen.

Juma Khan is reported to have appealed to friendly Sardars in Afghanistan for assistance in his struggle against the Iranian authorities who now fear a general rising of the isaluch tribes aided by their sympathisers in Afghanistan and India* »/ith the exception of the Rekis and N&amp;ruis, most of the baluch tribes are in sympathy with Juma Khan Ismailzai and have offered support. The Maruis fear that the Ismailzais, having left the Pir Suran hills and having taken up residence at iMarmashir, will be likely to raid them from the latter locality. The Narui tribesmen have tried there fore to compel their leader to compromise with Juma Khan and the bamari and Shayaki Sardars are also acting as intermediaries to effect reconciliation, but the pros pects are poor inasmuch as a clash has recently occurred in which the haruis lost seven killed and have retaliated by raiding Ismailzai flocks. A party of larmahommedzais on the way to join Juma Khan fell in with two companies of troops. A fight ensued near GARINCHAN (60 miles South-West of KWASH) in which b4 of the tribe were killed, among them 11 women.

The rifles are said to be juong Lee Enfield *303. 2. KHORAEdAk (a) Orders have recently been issued tnat all Jews residing near the frontiers of Knorassan should be called to Meshed. It is understood that this is in comormity with instructions issued by the Central Government lor eluding Jews to live in iron tier districts Passports issued to Jews wisning to travel to India are marked ’Not valid for Iraq,, Syria, or Palestine*. (U; me ^ainat, which until recently formed part of the province of Mekran, has now been included in the province of Khorassan. ic) The Minister for finance has sanctioned a loan oj lornans live million to the meshed municipality. The money which is to be spent on asphalting the main roadsin the town, establishing a municipal electric power house, and laying water pipes in the city, is to be refunded within ten years, 2/3ras by the shrine and l/3rd by the municipality. 3. S13TAN KAIK (a) The 2jabul-Zahidan road was breached by flood water near Mohamadabad, a village about ten miles from Zabul on 20th April. The breach whicn was approximate ly 400 yards wide was said to have been made ailiber- ately by a former canal guard lately dismissed from service. The road was closed for three weeks and damage estimated at 50,000/- Tomans was caused. (b) Two officials of the Soviet Consulate General 12 th keshed arrived at kjfcbul on the Itii Aay and left again 17th on the iXXti May after arranging for repairs to be carried out to the Bussian Consulate. (c) The original sum of Bials 85,000/- sanctioned for the construction of a hospital in 2 ftbul is said to have been increased to Bials 160,000/-. (d) k.Nahaqir, Inpsector of Education for kekran, on his return to Birjand from tour, is reported to have stated that he had discovered the existence of a private school for British subjects at Zahidan. This is probably the religious class run by the Sikh Gurd- wara to which he raised objection at the time of his visit to Zahidan. He remarked that in his opinion the school was run for political purposes and should be closed. 4. lll iillABi AfEAlBS (a) Three hundred trained soldiers and three lorry loads of arms and ammunition were despatched to kwash from Zahidan on 5th kay.

Kishawaz was released from police custody almost immediately. It is believed, however, that the matter will be reported to Tehran. (b) It is rumoured that two of the leading land lords of zjahiuan, Ruhullah and Buheli, have been directed to dispose of all their property other tnan the house in which they reside. It is also believed that Haji Hussain Agha, an important landlord of meshed who is at present detained under surveillance in Tehran has been similarly directed to dispose of his property ctLd iurtner tnat he shopld in future bank only with the National Bank of Iran with whom he nas been forbid den oo keep a current account of more than .Rials lOQO/-. The object is believed to be to force him to dispose of valuable property near keshed from which it isis proposed to bring the water supply to the neigh bourhood of the town, which will enable a •development* scheme to proceed. This scheme is one in which the Oovernor G-eneral ana certain other officials are personally interested. (c) The kjahidan municipal garaens have been let on a three years lease to an Iranian merchant. It is proposed to open a cafe in the gardens, where, on special occasions the military hand will entertain the public. (d) A British Indian subject named Budh Singh committed suicide by poisoning. His boay was found in the hills near Zahiaan. He left letters showing that he intended to take his life, as he was depressed by his business failure.

This, inspite of the fact that it had been made clear that they wished to visit keshed. As the Officers had only a few days leave no action could he taken to ootain permission for them to visit meshed, a visit which the local police prohibited without special sanction from Tehran. 8.

His father Shah Beg is said to have moved his family near the frontier to facilitate their removal to I*an. (b) Relations between the lamailaais and Naruis are disturbed. A fight occurred early in March in which two Naruis were Idlled. The Governor of Zahidan and Idu Khan are to endeavour to effect a reconciliation between these tribes. (c) A cousin of Juma Khan Ismailzai named Kohl Khan was recently near Chahbar where he was arrested by the followers of the late Mehrab Khan, being suspected by them of being a spy sent by the Government. 1^ will be remembered that Mehrab Khan and many of his relatives were murdered in cold blood by the former G. 0.0.(Blbura) who, by his ill-handling of the Baluchis produced the insurr ection of 1935-34. Kohi Khan was eventually relea sed. He has stated that Iranian Baluchistan is 11 full of rifles' 1 and many of the tribesmen have spare rifles in addition. (d) There are constant rumours that the tribes around Iransheher intend to rebel. There are also counter- rumours to the effect that the Government intends to take strong military action in 1936-37. (e) There have been many complaints against Sardar Kabibullah Khan Reki, who is commanding the Iranian P^st near Kuhak. (f) Sarhang Binadi, Governor of the Sara van district, has been very awtive in forcing the Baluchis to adopt a 3adopt European hats - some *ere flogged for non- compliance with the orders and many have left the district* T^eae incidents caused the Governor General of Mekran to leave for Baluchistan earlier than he intended* Meantoile there aw indications that the situation in SARAVAN district is deteriorating* Yarmuhamma&amp;zais are looting and attacked a military post killing twelve soldiers* Tuey are loggerheads with the Taraaaia and clashes with casualties are of daily occurrence* (g) x ,t is said that when Sarhang Husainpur and Behnam (Governor of Zahidan town) recently visited Juma Khan Ismailzai, they told him that if he were dissatisfied with the Iranian Government he was free to leave Iran* At any rate he should not create trouble in Iran, hut was free to loot in Afghan or British territory* Meanwhile the followers and relatives of Juma Khan are being given free issues of grain by the Iranians in an endeavour to detach them from allegiance to the sardar. This grain comes from Sis tan and is obtained there by the military at about l/6th of the price ruling in Zahidan, the population being forbidden to export grain from Sistan or to sell except to the military department* (h) An interesting bit of news comes from Kuhak district where our Levies were reticently accused of having entered Iranian territory* Habibullah Khan, relative of the Nawab of Khar an who holds the land near Kuhak which was claimed by the Iranians, is said to have proved to the satisfaction of the latter that this area belongs to him* He bases his title on a document dating from the time of his great-great-grand father (Jurdil Khan)* It may well be that we shall hear more of this and that the authorities in Tehran will endeavour to «save face* (they having had to admit that their original claim was without good foundation)foundation) 'by reviving this question. 2. MILITARY MATTERS Posts on the Sahidan - mrjawa • Kwash road were recently relieved. The soldiers were isainly trans ported in li-dian-owned lorries, at the rate of one Toman per man, as previously agreed. It is certain that these lorries would have 'been commandeered, hut for the protests made recently against such action. 3. EDUCATIONAL The local authorities at Zahidan are objecting to the continuance of the school maintained there by the British Indian subjects. Tuis school, in charge of an Indian school-master, has been in existence for many years and is attended by the Indian children. The Iranians wish to apply the Regulations of the Ministry of Education, which require the school-master to teach Iranian and to restrict the syllabus of instruction to that approved by the Ministry, which, needless to say, is quite unsuitable for Indian children. The situation is being watched by our V*ce Consul, frontier posts in K^orassan have been strengthened by cavalry detachments. This is to assist the local officials to control smuggling. Iw is reported that smugglers, assisted by Russian frontier officials, are smuggling a large number of sheep and cattle into Russia. 4. IggflBL Thirty families of Yarmut Turkomans crossed into Khorassan late in February. There were pursued into Iranian territory by Russian troops and two men killed The Governor General Kuorassan protested to the Soviet Consul General at Meshed. 5. H.I.M. THE SHAH*S BIRTHDAY AND NAU*ROZ Receptions were everywhere held by the Governors. AtV' * - 4 (KV At Meshed an entertainment was followed fty a display of fireworks, and a similar celebration was held at Birjand on a smaller scale* At Zabul official calls to offer congratulations were paid. H.B.M # s Consul General being temporarily indis posed was unfortunately unable to attend, but H«B*M f s Vice Coniul called and offered the usual congratula tions on the Consul General 1 a behalf. At Zahidan H.B.M # s Vice Consul was somewhat taken aback by his reception. Captain Campbell who is temporarily officiating in the post of Vice Consul, has no civil uniform, and had not provided himself when coining to Iran, with a •morning coat f . He consequently clad himself in his most sedate lounge-suit, expecting as hitherto to be received alone by the Governor General* His astonishment was great when a iJrass-Band struck up an unrecognisable tune, and he found officials grouped about the Governor, some in uniform and others in correct •morning dress* complete with top-hats l most Such a display at Zahidan proved/shattering and Captain Campbell*s usual sang-froid was momentarily disturbed* i 6* AMALGAMATION OB BBVBNUB AND CUSTOMS 33SBARTMBNTS In towns where both Revenue and Customs Departments have hitherto existed, the two have been amalgamated presumably as a measure of economy. 7. DHBSS RSPOHM Considerable energy has been displayed at Meshed to bring about the discarding of# the *Chaddur*. For March 5th certain zealous persons had arranged a • Fancy Dress* dance. T~e Governor General apparently reported this glad news to Tehran, but the advance of Meshed in such matters was evidently considered too rapid, for on the morning of the 5th telegraphic instructions were received that men and women must not be allowefc toto danc« together. Some 150 persons were thus condemned to sit around the walls of the hall and to indulge in samll talk for several hours. As a climax ^ two women more emancipated than their sisters^ventured to dance together. In Sistan, where the inhabitants are always on the verge of starvation, the authorities have been unable to bring abo$t greater change than the wearing of the • Chaddur* on the shoulders and a square handker chief on the head. 8. TBASXS The new Foreign Exchange Laws have for the moment stopped all trade. Even Consular officers who had funds in local banks are unable to remit to India or England. Among contraband articles now appearing in the baaaars of East Iran are (1) Cigarettes of very poor quality called •CAVANLARS* I and alleged « •made in London* and others purport ing to be # PAayers # cigarettes. (2) Gramophone needles in imitation of # His Master f s Voice* needles - the boxes bearing a picture of a dog and puppy instead of the well known dog and gramophone. Mien the lox is covered with the paper band it is only distinguishable from the genuine article under careful scrutiny. Tne paper bands bear the name 'Saji (name illegible| YahudiJ Ramadan, 9. ZABUL HOSPITAL At the time that our Legation in Tehran had been informed that Iranian hospital arrangements at Sabul were complete, nothing had in fact been done* At the end of March however some rooms in a house were white washed and beds and bedside tables locally made. Beds complete with bedding were set up - anybody who has experience of the average Sistani patient can imagine how long such material would remain sanitary. Finally some cases of drugs arrived and the Municipal doctor* 1 doctor 'became active* Hxs first patient died on the operating table, since then there appears to have been a dearth of applicants for surgical treatment® A good deal of propaganda is going on to draw atten~ tion to the •hospital* and it is known that attendance at the consulate hospital has been forbidden to Government employes and is, to say the least, discour* aged for others* There has been a great drop in numbers attending our hospital and it seems certain that there will be no object in keeping it open for the general public. On the other hand once our hospi tal is closed, it is almost certain that the Iranian hospital will have no funds with which to carry on (an initial grant only has been made from Tehran) and only those who can pay will be able to attend* It is inconceilwible that surgical work will be possible with the present equipment even if a competent surgeon were provided. 10* LAWLBSSNBSS On March 28th two lorries were fired upon at a spot on the Zahidan-Meshed road 12 miles from Zahidan* The brigands were not caught* 11. 0LI MATS An unusually late spell of cold, wet weather was experienced late in March in East Iran. Floods rendered the Zabul-Zahidan road impassible for some days and Meshed was cut off owing to snowfall, both from Sahidan and Tehran.

IRANIAN BALUCHISTAN AND THB SAHEAD Al&gt;out the 14th January the followers of Ab&amp;ul Hussein of SHMISHK attacked a military post near SAREAS and killed twelve soldiers. Juma Knan Ismailzai still declines to meet the Iran* ian officials and attempts hy the latter and hy Idu Khan to make peace 'between Jam Khan ard M&amp;lak Snah Khan have also proved unsuccessful* Khalil Khan Reki (referred to in previous Diaries) now an officer in the Frontier Customs Guards, recent ly seized Rials 1000/- in coin from a Baluchi. He retained Rials 200/- and handed over the remainder to the Customs, out of this Rials 300/- was given to him as reward. Khalil has let it he known that once he has established a reputation as a zealous officer, he will begin to assist smugglers who are fellow tribesmen l This versatile official appeared to be still regarded as belonging to the Cnagai Levy Corps during the first half of February, for he was sent for by the Assistant Political Agent Cnagai and spent about ten days at Kacha, returning to Iranian territory on 16th February. He appears therefore at the same time to have held a PPpintments Doth in the Chagai Levy Corps and the Iranian Customs Guards, and to be holding up smugglers of coin while promising them assistance in the future. Followers of Lashkaran Yarmuhammadzai endeavoured to loot sheep from British territory on 6th February. The shepherd was wounded. Levies from GULISHTAB are said to have pursued the raiders as far as the Iranian frontier. Mullick Sardar Anmed of the firm of N.A*Mullick &amp; Sons, zahidan states that he has contracted to theRevenue of 21 Baluchi* villages in the Iransheher district. Ho is to he allowed to collect revenue in currency, whereas the Iranians have collected such revenue as they could in kind, it is remarkable that whereas every step is being taken to oust British Indians from legitimate trade, national pride does not apparently preclude the faming of tax-collection to Indians. Eighteen Iranian officials described as a •Board of Investigation* 1 arrived at T^hidan on 31st January ard have been delving into the affairs of the various departments. For some reason unknown they visited the Sikh Grurdwara on 3rd Ifcbruary and enquired into the title to the land, expenditure on the building, its history and asked questions regarding the Sikh religion gCICMAHDBBBINGr OF LORRISS AT ZAHXDAN On February 12th a soldier was sent from the Military Lines at Sahidan to our Vice Consulate bearing several copies of the alleged •Proceedings'* of the Committee held on December 21 st 1935. From these records it was made to appear that all parties had agreed to Rials 400/- as the hire for a lorry to Kwash, on the recent occasion of commandeering of lorries, our Trade Assis tant who had bean present at the * Commit tea* was asked to sign these * Be cords of the Proceedings*. As however the hire tetx* of Rials 400/- had been proposed by the President of the Committee - a.g. the officer responsi ble for the Commandeering- and vigorously dwclinwd by the lorry drivers, it had to be regretted that the Consulate representative could not accept the document as a proper record of the Committee proceedings. KHQRASSAN The entire energies of the officials of Meshed have been devoted to encouraging the women to appear unveil ed in public. A good deal of pressure has been broughtDrought on officials to make their wives so appear and all sorts of public functions have been staged at which women appeared including a mass attendance of officials and their families at the Snrincu Tne most elaborate precautions were taken on this occasion, the streets being lined with troops and the Shrine sur rounded, Some inconvenience has been caused to British Moslem women who have been refused admission to Bath#, Cinemas, etc., oecause they were veiled. The movement is undoubtedly very unpopular; officials dare not oppose it and the general pulilic have too vivid a memory of the massacre which occurred in the Shrine last summer as the result of public protests. un February 4th, the birthday of the imam Reza some 4500 troops visited the Shrine. They marched fully armed and preceded by the band and colours. This was presumably staged as a preliminary to the mass visit of officers and wives referred to above, which took place on the 10th and was to overawe possible malcon tents. \ Information has Just been rtfceivsd, from Meshed to the effect that the polio, have been instructed to cease interfering with Foreign Moslem women who remain yelled, provided the latter produce Nationality docu ments. No doubt enthusiasm will wear them in time, hut for some few months foreign Moslem women will no doubt be considerably worried by the petty officials. AFGHAN AFFAIBS Aii Afghan Consul General named Saz Mahomed has now been appointed to Meshed. Tne post has bean vacant for a long time, a cl.rlc having officiated.

Khalil K.an (Halilak) son of Shan Beg returned to KP-cha Levy Post on 22nd December he turned up again in Zahi&amp;an on 30th December with gifts for tne Governor General, it was said he had resigned his appointment in the Cnagai Levy Corps and nas now been appointed a warrant officer in the Iran ian Customs Guards. It is rumoured that Shah Beg intends also to join this Corps. It has oeen reported at Zahidan that Mehrab Khan a relative of the Nawab of Kharan took possession of a spring on the British side of the frontier near Kuhak early in December last. Tne Iranians attempted to dis lodge him but were fired upon and some soldiers were killed, i* was after this alleged occurrence that the K^hak post was reinforced, it has not been confirmed whether this incident actually occurred, it may be ti at Utl ' ^cuse is being advanced by the Iranians fox their sudden increase of the force at Kuhak. luu K..an is Relieved to have succeeded in his mission toto Juma KHan and the latter to have agreed to submit to authority. Relatives of Juma Khan are to visit the Governor General, although Juma has excused himself as he does not trust the assurances that he would not be detained. In regard to the looting of shops at BUG, referred to in last months Diary, Juma K^an is reported to have accused Idu Khan and stated that the raiders were:- Mahmud Khan (Idu # s son-in-law) Shan Beg (Idu’s brother) Khalil Kuan (Idu*s nephew) and that two Ismailzais foolishly assisted and have been imprisoned by him (Juma) as he has no desire to r bt on bad terms with the Biitish. Idu Khan has howevei let the following story become known Kir Azad Khan, Rasaidar Major of the Cnagai Levies instructed Baz Mohammed, N.0.0* at Pxran, and Isa Khan Ismailzai (Lance Naik at Lur) uo loot the shops in revenge for tribal enmity with Khan Bahadur Snakar Khan who had some personal interest in the shops. Baz Mohammed and isa Khan organised the raid and sent Sahib Dad Qamarzai, Haji Karim Ismailzai, and some others to carry it out. Tne loot was taken to Juma Khan in Iranian territory but Juma refused to accept it. li was then distributed in six shares. Sahib Dad and his companions among the qamarzais took their snares to Afghanistan to Mulla Rahim at Bandar Kamal Khan (Map reference 62'R 30‘N). Haji Karim Ismailzai while going to British territory died at Snamidar and his loot was distributed among Isa Khan, Haji Karim, three Qw.marzais and Nek Muhammad £arazai (orother of Baz Mwnammed). As the source of the above information is Idu K^an^wno is strongly suspected of having inst igated the raid with the connivance of the Iranian authorities, it is not possible to place much reli ance on tne report.

To make sure of this they have been required to attend with their husbands when the latter drew ihxx their salary, and to meet the Head of the husband^s Department.

Dear Rumbold, I enclose a copy of a letter from the Moscow Chancery about the Meshed diaries. The Chancery are of course wrong in thinking that they are sent copies of the diaries direct from Meshed. Actually they receive their copies from us and we from you. In these circumstances, and as the diaries are prepared originally for the Government of India, the proper course seems to be for us to suggest to you that you should ask the Government of India if they can modify their instructions to Meshed as proposed. In principle we sympathise with the Chancery's remarks as we have noticed how very small a proportion of 'Russian” news there is in these diaries. Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) LAURENCE COLLIER. H.A.F. Rumbold Esq., India Office,(125/3/36). A BRITISH EMBASSY, MO SC07/. 19th February 1936. Dear Consulate-General, Subject to the concurrence of the Northern Department, through whom this goes to you under flying seal, we suggest that it is no longer necessary for you to send us copies of your monthly commercial diaries. As regards the political diaries, we have found that there are generally not more than two small items of interest to us in each of them, and we wonder whether you could in future put such items in a special Soviet section and let us have a copy of that alone? This would save us wading through a great mass of stuff which has no bearing on our work here. *ve understand that you already make one separate annex which deals with the locust nuisance; another on ’Russian' affairs (i.e. both Soviet and refugee) would make a very suitable pendant to it. If, however, the proposal would for any reason cause you inconvenience, please let us know. Yours, &amp;c», (Sgd.) MOS COY CHANCERY• British Consulate-General, Meshed.

The robbers were believed to have be en A-ghans. 2. IRANIAN BALUCHISTAN AND THE SARHAD (a) Late in November armed Baluchis believed to be the followers of Malik Mohamed Khan who recently emigrated from Sahidan to Afghanistan, raj^ed the grazing grounds near Zdhidan and carried off four riding camels proper ty of Zahidan police. They were traced to the frontier s near Robat whence they crossed into Afghani tan. (b) On November 25th a party of Yarmahommedzais stole five camels near Mirjawa. Tney were followed but escap ed into the hills near Ladgasht. (c) Sardar J-ma Khan Ismailzai has been gathering his tribesmen. lie suspects that troops recently moved from Kerman to Iransheher and from Zahidan to Kwash are to be employed against him. He has formed an alliance with Abdul Hussain of Remishk. (d) Idu Khan Reki accompanied by his family reached Zahidan from Tehran on 7th December. It was learnt that Idu K-an was likely to induce his brother Shah Beg (an N.C.O. in the Cnagai Levies) to return to Iran. He was to be promised two aueducts (Karezes) and his rV son, Halil Khan an appointment as Naib ARSHAD (Lieut;)2 . 17 ) in the Customs jfrontier Guard. Later Halil Khan (known as Halilak) turned up at Zahiuan aiJd the above rnfonaa- tion was confirmed. The Karezes offered to Bnah Beg Beki are in the neighbourhood of K-.^sh. He is said to be dis^* satisfied owing to the promotion of another N.C.O. to the rank of Kwte Kavildar which he had coveted, and as a result to be flirting with the idea of leaving British territory and settling in Kwash. Idu Khan is apparently opposed to Shah Beg accepting the Iranian offers, as the Behis feel that it would be unwise to sever connection with British territory, which might offer convenient refuge in time of need. Halil Khan (who it was ascertain ed was on leave from the Chag&amp;i Levy Corps) has supplied twenty five. Kejcis for enlistment in the Frontier Customs Guard and undertaken to produce a further twenty five* It is thus apparent that Shah Beg and his son are en deavouring to serve both the Iranians and the British Baluchistan authorities and to keep a footing on either side of the frontier* (e) Hews was received at Sahidan about 20th IJecember That Iranian tribesmen had raided BUG in British terri tory and had looted the contents of two shop# there. Motor drivers reported that the incident had caused great excitement among the Cnagai Levy Corps posts on the road, particularly as one shop is alleged to belong to an ex- Levy Corps man named Mullah Karim Balesh anu it is believed that goods are stocked there prior to being smuggled into Iran. If this be the case such smuggling must take place with the connivance, if not, active assistance of men of the Corps. No request for Consular action to recover the stolen property has been received from Baluchistan, and it may be that the incident has not been reported. If this be the case it would seem to indicate ^ anxiety to avoid um/elcome attention to the smuggling activities.(£) Juma K^an Ismailzai has heen ofrered Hials 2G0C/- per mensem hy the Iranian military authorities on con dition that he should assist in case of operations aga inst Abdul Hussain of Bemishk. He has so far declined hut Idu Khan is being sent to persuade him to this enn* Vg) Abdul Hussain, Juma Khan Ismailsai, Nowshetoan (brother of the late Dost Mohamed) and Lashlcaran (son in law of jahind Khan who has long been in jaily are reported to have agreed upon mutual assistance to oppose any military operations undertaken against any one of them* (h) On 14th December an unconfirmed report was received that a large number of rifles had been stolen from troops in SARAVAN district and a number of soldiers killed. A later report confirmed that thirty soldiers had been killed by the followers of Nowshe^van and that serious trouble was impending* (i) The Gr. G.C. is preparing to leave Kwash early in January with a force which is to join troops frcm Kerv man am advance towards Chahbar, presumably to attack the tribal combination referred to in para*(g) aoove* (j) An appeal by the tribesmen for the release from prison in Tehran of Jahind Khan, has beer lorwarucd and recommended by the Governor General. Jaliind f s son has volunteered to replace his father as hostage* Ik) About the middle of December it was stated in Ziahidan that British levies of Garavek post east of KUEAK had occupied a position inside Iranian territory. It now appears that Sardar Habibullah Be^ (2nd Lieut^ in Iranian Army) was sent from Kwash to ascertain the facts. He reported that some levies were in fact at the place (GOBICH KALAG) but he was uncertain whether the spot was in Iranian territory or not. In spite of this report the Iranians at once commandeered lorries (mostly those of Indians working in transit on the Z&amp;hidan-Kundi international road) and rushed troops4. to KUHAK where the strength of the post was to 380 ana sone guns. It has since transpired, that after the events outlined, in para.(n) the authorities were exceedingly nerous and that the appearance of a few Ohagai levies on a hill near Frontier Boundary Post 3 (about 5* miles from KDHAK) gave rise to the Inaccurate report that our levies had crossed the frontier. Doufct less the Iranians suspected some sinister motive and imagined, they were in some way supporting Nowsheyvan. Troops were rushed to KUHAK partly on the strength of the false report and partly owing to the prevailing nervousness resulting from the loss of thirty soluiers in the neighbourhood* (1) A report just received throws further light on the raiu on BUG mentioned in para.(e). The lootea goods were carried on camels first towards the Afghan border and later turned towards Zahiuan, the tracks being traced to wft within one mile of the town. There are grounds for suspecting that this raid took place with the connivance of the Iranian authorities at zahidan, the raiders having been instigated by one kahomed Khan (son in lav/ of Iclu Khan). Idu Khan received information of the raid direct from S/£iah Beg from Kacha Post. Among the raiders were:- 1 # Daa Mahomed 2. Has san-i-Ghulam Reza Qamarzai 3. Khuaa Baksh, son of Hussain Qamarzai 4. sahib Bad, son of Malik Bad 5. Ismail 6. Mehrab , 7. Bur Mahomed, and six others, all of whom are well known among the Baluchis. Nos, 1,5,6 and 7 are Ismail- zais and are in the confidence of Mahmiu Khan and of Halilai (son of Shah Beg, Chagai Levy Corps). The li*t has been traced to Shore, the home of Juma Khan Ismailzai. Idu Khan to turn suspicion from his son-in- law announced that the raiders were all Ismailzais. This greatly incensed the son of luma Khan Ismailaai, since the tritoe as a whole have no desire to get a5. 'bad reputation in British Baluchistan. After an alter cation with Idu Khan he left to urge his father to recover the loot if possible and return it to British territory. As a result of a request 'by H.B.M*s Vice Consul at Zahid&amp;n to the Governor General to use his good offices to secure return of the stolen property, Idu Khan has 'become alanaed and is said to 'be endeavouring to recover the property. The Governor General did not deny that he had heard of the raid hut has asked for minute details of the goods stolen, etc. This case has been quoted at length as an example of the tangled skein existing dn this frontier, where the tribes have a footing on both sides and endeavour to play off one authority against another. It is also Quoted because there seem grounds for supposing that this raid received some measure of official encouragement from the Iranian side and may be followed by further similar occurrences. It is be lieved that a policy has been conceived whereby the Baiuch tribes may be discouraged from opposing Iranian control if allowed a free hand to loot in British terri tory. This particular case was mishandled because sus picion early fell on Idu Khants relative Mahmud and his gang, and details were given away because blame was wrongly placed on the Ismailzais, who to clear themselves disclosed the plot. It being knwon that information had leaked out, Idu Khan has been instructed by the Governor General to make every effort to recover the goods. The Governor General presumably no:''wishing that the sus- pectea connivance of the officials should be j^skked into by us, appears reaay to assist. Kxcept with the connivance of officials the stolen goods would never have been carried to Shore via Zahidan. (m) A number of cases of inter-tribal raiding, seizure of arms from Frontier Customs Guards, etc., indicate that the situation in Iranian Baluchistan is once , - more■ becoming out of hand. 3. MILITARY AFFAIRS The military authorities are giving increased, attention to training conscripts in range-firing. The period of conscription is said to have heen increased from two ijs years to three. The third year will he spent in the roaa gendarmerie or police. This is presumably a measure of State economy. 4. COMMUNICATIONS The road from KWASH to lEANSEEHER has been completed to XhGHAB (57 miles south of Kwash). A road is under con** struction from MAGAS to IRANSHEHER via SURAN. A tele graph line is under construction from KWASH to SARAVAN (formerly DIZAK). 5. AFGHAN AFffAIBS Abdul Ghafoor Khan has been appointed Afghan Consul at Zabul. He was formerly Passport Officer at Peshawar* 6. CUSTOMS A batch of officials arrived at Zahidan to enquire into irregularities in the Customs. 7. THE QAINAT Bandits believed to be Bahloris attacked and looted a village 20 miles west of Birjand on 6th December. A sum of Rials 110,000/- has been allocated as •Income Tax* for Birjand and the ^ainat. A few officials drew up lists and determined the amount each person is to pay* The export of saffron has become a government monopoly This was largely exported by Indians who thus lose a further opportunity for trade. «. KHQRASSAN (a) Asadi, the Mutawallibashi of the Shrine of Imam Reza was suddenly arrested early in the month and is appar ently being charged with cor^icity in the riots which occurred in the autumn. Common sense would dictate that a man as astute as Asadi is known to be,would not have attempted to encourage any out-break in the Shrine forfor the conduct of the affairs of whick he is directly responsible. It may however well he that he will suffer as a scapegoat to cover the deficiences of the police and military who handled the situation in such a deplorr able manner. It is evidently desired to represent that the outbreak was deliberately instigated and was not, as was certainly the case, a popular movement to voice disapproval of H.I.M. the Shah’s efforts to •modernise'. News has just been received at the end of the month that AS.ADI h&amp;s since been executed* (h) With effect from 1st December military officers of the Meshed garrison were ordered to remain in darracuo at night time* (c) Four O.I.D. Inspectors arrived in Meshed on 3rd December. It is stated that they had been sent to report on the feelings of military officers towards Government. Somev/hat similar reports from elsewhere in East Iran seem to indicate that there is uneasiness in this resrse pact. (a) Lutfi, the Chief Justice of Khorassan was imprisoned on 3rd December. ^e) Very frequent reports have been received of clashes between gendarmerie and bandits at various points on the frontier of Khorassan. These combined with similar reports from the Qainat and of the generally disturbed conditions in Iranian Baluchistan clearly indicate that lawlessness is increasing. Failure to deal adequately with these disorders for the past two years in encour aging others to join in. Ttfhereas the robber bands oper ating in Khorassan and qain are invariably represented as Afghans, it is well known that a proportion of Iran ians who know the terrain are Included, ine latter are being slowly driven to robbery by the economic condi tions and the prestige of the Government having un doubtedly decreased, as a result of inadequate measur es to cope with banditry, such a means of livelihooda. is 'becoming increasingly attractive, if) Another British Indian subject named Syed Mazhar Hussain has been ordered by the police to leaisre Meshed, though not necessarily to &lt;iuit the country. He is a civil pensioner, having formerly served about 30 years in the British Consulate General at Baghdad. He has for some years held the coveted position of a •Khadim' in the Shrine. That is to say he had been allotted a small i room in which to live, in return for which he acquired merit by assisting to sv/eep the courtyard. He is very aged, so decrepit that he can scarcely walk. His expul sion is said to have been decided upon on the grounds that he was •friendly * with AS ADI % a description which must equally apply to every employee of the Shrine, they being entirely dependent on the Mutawallibashi for the retention of their appointments. The expulsion of such a person as dangerous to tne state would be quite ludicrous were it not for the hardship involved. To die in the service, of the Shrine is highly meritorious and Syed Mazhar had almost attained his object. As he has elected to make a further attempt by removing himself to the Shrine at Kerbela and since he will be safer there than in Iran, H.B.M # s Vi.ce Consul has been instr ucted to make no representations on his behalf. It appears now to be a determined policy to remove all Indians from service in the Shrine. Inasmuch as the Shrine revenues consist very largely of gifts and bequ ests from I~dia (including the very large •Cudh Bequest) such a policy must, in time, cause dissatisfaction among Indian Shiahs.

His failure in this instance was largely due to the attitude of suspicion with which Juma Khan regarded all efforts to draw him from his native hills and to an ill-timed raid in which the Narois carried off five camels belonging to Juma Khan. fa (2) At the beginning of the month raiders, be- longAK^ to the followers of Malik Mohd Khan Baluch of Sahidan, carried off thirteen camels, the property of Gazi Khan Ismailzai. Gazi Khan and his adherents later recovered the camels but the raiders escaped. SISTAN AND KAIN (2-) H*I,k, the Shah gave a 27 year lease for the lands oeionging to the village of Sharifabad to Amir Samsam- ud Daulah, ex-Govemor of Sistan and a nephew of Amir Jhaukat-ul Mulk. For the first ten years the lands will be g free of Revenue tax. The ex-Gove rnor # s house in Zabul was recently raided by the police and one rifle, one shot gun and some patent medicines were confiscated. {^) The Afghan Consul at Sabul is being pressed to vacate the ouiiding rented by him. The military authorities object to his residence being close to the barracks which houses a few hundred conscripts. (3) The enmity which has persisted for about two years between rival parties of officials at Zabul, headed respectively by the Governor and the Peace CourtJadge auite fimstrates any efforts towards orderly Government. Both parties continually appeal to i^-hran on the most trivial matters. (4) On November 22nd an Indian named Gopal Singh who is erecting a garage at Ziabul was summoned to the police station together with three motor drivers. They were detained from sunset to midnight. The cause of this was that Gopal Singh had permitted the drivers to use his partly constructed garage. The head of the police order-i ed that the irx lorries he removed to the Iranian garage The drivers refused to comply with this high-handed order and Gopal Singh filed a suit against the police for illegal detention. The matter ms taken up by our Vice consul wh6 succeeded in obtaining cancellation of the police order and the Sikh withdrew his case in the local Court. (5) The Revenue Department of Sis tan have ordered that all exports and imports toom Sistan shall follow certain fixed routes, the owners of goods following any other route are liable to prosecution. (6) Five notables of the Mi%nkangi District were arrested during the month, under suspicion of having rendered assistance to Khan Nabi Z&amp;dad who last month paid a flying visit to Sabul from Afghanistan in order to collect his family. 5. KHOBASSAN The civil authorities in Meshed appear to be apprehen sive of further disturbances in the town. A detachment of the famous •Marg* regiment has been brought to Meshed from Tehran. Several influential persons have been arrested, the chief of whom are Asadi, the Mutta-walii- bashi of the Meshed Shrine and Aga Zadeh, the principle Mujtahid of Meshed. Complaints of oppression have been lodged against the dir ii - -—3. Hoad.^ Guards Department, as a result of which a Committee ox two military officers and two civil officers has been appointed, to hold an enquiry into the causes. Ihe annual Meshed race meeting was held on the parade ground on the 15th November. Bepresentatives of all Consulates in Meshed attended the meeting which was on ±h&lt; the whols we&amp;l organised* Bakravan, Governor General for Khorassan has been. appointed temporarily to the office of Matwalli'^l^h ot the Shrine. 4 a MILITARY AFFAT-RS A Lay-baling plant / complete with oil engine / has been erected in Sahidan by the military authorities to facili tate transport of fodder for the cavalry in Nekran. The military barracks under construction in sabul collapsed uuring the month. On investigation it was found that they had been sited badly and a rise of sub soil water caused the foundations to subside. i. K07BMKNTS OF I BANIAN OFFT m Azsi Aga Kazimi the Iranian Minister for foreign Affairs passed through Meshed and zahidan on his way to India at the he ginning ol* the month* Sarhang Atta uilah, Chief Secretary to the Mekran Gover norate, left Zahidan for Tehran at the beginning of the month. 6 . MOVEMENTS Of FOREIGN NATTniJai.a One victor Vastakoff, accused of being a Soviet G.P.u. spy, was arrested and brought to Meshed on the 20th November. He will be sent to Tehran for trial.in ^ahidan on the.29th October and applied for Visa for India. Having no means oi subsistence in India, the Visa were refused. SSCUBITY OV ROADS Further information has been received from a reliable source regarding the activities of the Bandit who has been operating ©n the lie shed-Turbat road. The Iranians allege that it was this man who fired on Mr. Hart and party last year. He subsequently fled to Afghanistan, was arrested but escaped from prison at Herat. He recommenced operations and it was due to his presence in the hills that an escort was provided for Mr. Mallet and party when shooting near Meshed in October last. It appears that the military officer in charge of the area in which he moved about, was actually sharing the proceeds of the robberies with the bandit, it may safely - be assumed that sane sajrtportion of the money so gained found its way to his superiors at Meshed. Not satisfied with robbing lorries, the bandit later looted animals and grain from the smaller villages, as a result of which the villagers despatched a telegram to H.I.M. the Shah protesting against the inefficiency of the military authorities. His Majesty is believed to have reprimanded % Iraj Kban, G.0.0. Meshed and to have issued stringent orders that the robber should be caught within ten days’ I* is significant that these happenings coincided with the action taken by the military authorities against the unfortunate Headman of the village near which Mr. Mallet and party camped. Trie only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the military authorities excused their apparent inability to arrest the robber on the grounds that he was being aided by the headman of the village supported by/lthe British. Finally it has been learnt on good authority that the5 the village telegraph master who despatched the villagers* complaint to the Shah, has been severely taken to task hy the &lt;3.0.C. tor so doing.

Malik Shah Khan Naroi Sardar of kasratabad was to have been summoned at the same time and it was hoped that as a result of discussions between the two parties held under the supervis ion of the Governor and the G.O.C. some suitable terms of peace between the Ismailzai followers oi Juma Khan and Karoi Baluchis could be arrived at. Unfortunately the deputation was unable to persuade either Juma Khan or his brother to call on the Governor General and returned on August the 3ist, accompanied only by Jalal Khan son of Juma Khan. it is said that Yarwar Ibrahim Khan remanded that Juma Khan should enlist 60 Road Guards and pay blood money for the karoi Baluch Killed last month by Sharif Khan (reported in Khorassan Diary for the month cf August 1935J.

Jamal Lin who has considerable influence amongst the Ismailzais has now returned to his home* It would appear that the Governor General is trying to weaken the position of Juma Khan by turning the more influential Ismailzais against him. 13 ) Mahmud Khan, son-in-law of Idu Khan who was arrested in 1933 and taken to keshed was releas ed on the 22nd March 1935. he has since been appointed as a junior officer in the Zahidan Hoad Guards Department and placed on duty on the road between Lar and kirjawa.

June* Abdul Hussain of Bemishk has turned out the amnieh appointed by the Government. The Governor-General has sent luu knan to Hemishk to say that as the amnjah are local men and were appointed at the 3ardar*s suggestion, he should let them remain and not openly oppose the Government although he is himself unwilling to submit. The officials have now started a lenient policy in dealing with the Baluchis. If arrested smuggling, the goods are not confiscated and only normal customs duty is demanded. Customs officials have been forbidden to search their houses without special sanction of the military authorities. A rumour is current in Baluchistan that rifles of Belgian origin are being smuggled into Mekran and Iranian Baluchistan from Dubai . ^ ^ , i , and that Abdul Hussain and others have purchased a number. General Amanullah Mirza reached 2iahidan by air from meshed on 17th. June. On the 21st.he proceeded to 2abul with the Governor-General. When leaving &amp;abul elaborate pre cautions were taken. The streets were lined with troops and cars were sent out of the town after dark,lights being switched off. The General and the Governor-General then went to the cars by a circuitous route outside the town. A sum of two million Bials has been sanctioned for construction of barracks at Sahidan and tenders have ^een called for at &amp;abul for the supply of materials.* V 2 - materials• &gt; Idu. Khan was sent to iiolat on 5tli« June to endeavour to persuade Malik Mahomed Khan and his followers to return to Iran* The S&amp;rdar avoided him and it is now stated that together with nine members of his family, he has crossed into Afghan territory, wither the majority of his tribesmen had preceded him. On receipt of orders from Tehran all members of the Bahai sect at Zahidan were arrested but were released after one week. Their mosque has been confiscated and religious meetings prohibited. 3. Military . In addition to the new barracks at 2-a hi dan, additional accommodation is being prepared at Zabul where the garrison is to be raised to one thousand infantry and the same number of cavalry. Hangars for six military aeroplanes are being built at Meshed. 4. Sistan . The attention of the Iranian Government seems once more to have been drawn to Sistan. At a meeting held by the Governor-General and General Amanullah Mirza, proposals were discussed to open the Bund-i-Balbaka on the Helmand and divert water into the Bud-i-Biyaban in order to decrease the water annually flowing into the Hamun, which would enable a direct road to be made from Sistan to Neh in Qain. It is strongly rumoured that the Iranians intend to remove troops from Kwash and to make Zahidan and Zabul the Headquarters. In short it seems that they are beginning to despair of ruling the Baluchis by military force alone, and are paving the way for evacuating Iranian Baluchistan. The Iranian Criminal Investigation Department Inspector Sasani who has been some time at Zabul and who is s aid to have reported to Tehran that the tribes were about to revolt and had been instigated by the British, has fallen foul of everybody. His two assistants have left for meshed, declaring that they cannot work with him. Before leaving they thrasnedthrashed Sasani 'because he had not fairly divided bribes taken. further Criminal Investigation Apartment officials are now expected from Tehran to enquire into this matter and further to examine the cause of friction between the Governor and other officials. Inhabitants of Sistan have been forbidden to sell grain to Indian merchants&gt;as the trade is to beieserved to one of the new 'Monoply' Companies. The price of all food stuffs in zabul has greatly increased, owing to extensive purchases by the military. 5 * The new order regarding ^urooe&gt;n hats . Governors are variously interpreting the order for Iranian subjects to wear European hats. in some places pressure is already being brought to bear on the inhabitants --iu others time is oeing allowed as hats are not available, wo customs are to be charged on imports, and Indian traders at Zahidan have ordered some ten thousand hats from India. 6• Lawlessness . A lorry travelling on the Turbat road was recently fired upon near the place where Jtr. Hart was held up last year. several detachments of troops have recently been despatched to the Afghan border, to endeavour to intercept raiders who are at present very active. ..-iscellaneoUK . Heavy rain near Kuchan caused the itrak river to overflow on the 16th., and a large part of the Shirwan plain was inundated. Several lives were lost a nd damage is estimate at Bials 1,600000. 4 Jive hundred Turkoman refugee families residing near Bujnurd have been ordered to settle at Zurabad, the part of the frontier evacuated by Iranian subjects who emigrated to : : aisfss last year. Thirty families of Xamut Turkomans endeavoured to enter Iran near Jargalam on the 29th. of May. They were fired on by Soviet guards and suiiered seven casualties. The survivors entered Iran but had to abandon their belongings.-4' belongings• On the other hand it is reported that soiue families of Turkomans are endeavouring to re-enter Russia&gt; as they have found conditions in Iran worse than those experienced in Russia. open on Fridays and that Sunday will be the official holiday. The officials in charge of Departments are, however, await local Inspector of Education has also received official school unveiled. A second German doctor has been engaged for the Shah Xleza Hospital at Meshed. On the 19th. June (birthday of the Prophet Mahomeu) tho Mutawalli Rashi of the Shrine at Meshed invited the heads of Departments to the Shrine. They attended in European hats, a facts which seems to have been severely criticised by the junior Shrine officials and mujtahlda . The Bund-i-purian on the Helmand River, on the Iranian side of the frontier in Sistan, is said to have been breached by Afghans and a dispute has arisen. The Afghans are also reported to have placed a military post at Chahkas, which they claim is in Afghan territory. This has given rise to a further dispute. 9. Police action at Dahidan . Two Indian motor drivers were recently ordered by the police to leave Iran. The Governor-General intervened and requested the central authorities to cancel the deportation order, which has been done. A number of Iranian traders suspected of smuggling and who had been ordered by the police to leave Zahidan for the Interior, have also been permitted to remain. 10.

During the recent disturbances in Baluchistan the late General-Officer-Commanding (Alburz) arrested the Sardar cand some of his family on suspicion that they were prepared to assist the Ismailzais. After his release further pressure was Drought to bear upon him, in connection with various schemes for town improvements, public gardens, etc.. in short it seems that the authorities had designs on his property which includes the only suitable sites for government buildings etc. which are known to be projected. (6) Two Indian motor drivers Malik Chand and aundar Das who were arrested in 1933 for smuggling aials to Nok-Kundi, | ^ toeeu ordered ty the Police at Zahidan to leave Iran within 15 daj'S. Lhey have appealed to the isinistry of Interior, and i/Oh Governor has Deen i^quested to postpone expulsion until receipt of the result of the appeal.

At Meshed where the Governor-General shows every sign of being pro-Soviet and anti-British, only two senior officials were allowed to accept invitations and all civilians were prohibited* On the other hand at aahidan, where the Governor is not so anti-British in his outlook, the Governor accepted invitations and permitted five officials to accompany him although, according to the regulations * the rank of none of these was such that they could accept invitations to a Consulate. The still more junior officials were allowed to attend a garden party the following day# (3) At Birjand where the Governor is away, the acting Governor has no influence and such matters are&lt;tleoided by the Head of the Police, who is aggressively anti-British* Recently a meeting was held to devise means of starting a local tennis club -such clubs having been ordered by Tehran# Without having consulted the pgtsons concerned, several members of the meeting, including the officiating Governor, proposed that our Indian Vice-Consul and a Russian doctor who has been 16 years at Birjand and is now an Iranian subject, should be invited to join. The proposal was talked down by the Chief of the Police on the grounds that, as foreigners, they should not be invited to join the club.

It had been rumoured in tne Sarhad that Jiand Khan had died in the prison at Meshed# Up till the end of February Bajar Khan had not arrived at aahedan and the Yarmuhaimnadzais had declared that they would not make peace with the authorities until they saw him in person. Greneral Jehanbani in conversation with His Britannic Majesty*s Consul-General referred to Jiand Khan c;s still alive; the delay in releasing Bajar Khan may, however, be accounted for if Jiand is dead, for he would be bound to confirm the death of his father, and the Yar- muhammadzais would be liable to assume that he had not met a natural death and to continue their recalcitrant attitude, Sardar Shah Sawar Yarmuhammadzai later went to Kwash and surrendered rifles which had been taken from the military post at Sangoon. General JehanDuni is reported to have asked Sardar Juma Khan to prepare a. claim of all losses suffered by him personally in the disturbances, which he would recommend the Persian Government to refund. on the other hand he inti mated that the Sardar*s tribe would be heI pI responsible for the expenses incurred by the General in repressing the out break. in short, if juma Khan will stop the lawlessness of his tribe ana make them pay damages to the Government, he (Juma Khan) will be paid his personal claims.

As the latter lay on the road covered with a coat, after being wounded, he is naturally unable to identify any body. From information received by His Britannic Hajesty*s Consul-General it seems certain that the robbers werewere Baluchis, who retired slowly to Baluchistan — iroha Dly to the Bam area# The Persians seem desirous of capturing some unfortunate individuals to serve as scapegoats in order to prove that they have taiten ener*- getic action* It will indeed he surprising if any ro Dbers are apprehended at this late date, whom Mr*Hart could identify* The water of two large 'karez 1 * (under-ground water channels) is to he brought to lieshed hy pipes* The village of Alamdasht (about 87,500 square yards of gardens) formerly the property of Mahdavi, one-time representative for Khorasan in the Mejlis, has been declared by t he Courts to belong to the Shrine of Imam Reza* This property is to be sold and the money utaixsea for the purchase of the pipes for the water supply* The tax for water supplied will be devoted to the maintenance of the Shah Reza Hospital* The difficult problem of financing the water supply and the hospital has thus been happily solved at the cost of the unfortunate liahdavi* Twenty-six teggars who declined to enjoy the accommo dation of the 'Poor House- at lieshed, died from exposure in the r ecent intense oold.

To maintain that the protection of the contractor’s servants was no concern of the milj.tci.ry, when the situation had deteriorated to the xtent that open warfare existed and the supply of the forces should have keen entirely taken over hy the Military Department, is to adayance an argument which no reasonable mind could accept.

When loaded they attempted to force the cleaner to leave for Kv-ash without the Owner-driver. On his refusal, he was puhlically beaten and struck with rifle butts. Meanwhile H.B. M # s Vice Consul had made representations to the Governor, and an order was given for the troops to release the lorry, whereupon they again heat the cleaner, hut released the lorry. On the l&amp;th, three lorries driven by HAZRA SIKG-H, DAUB ABA SINGH, and MOHAN SINGH were commandeered and taken tc Kwash. On the 13th they returned escorted only by two soldiers in each lorry* Shortly after leaving Kwash they found the camp of some road repairers deserted and looted, ana a little further on a Gendarme post deserted and burnt. The Indians pointed out that the post was alright the previous day, and that it would be safer to return to Kwash. The soldiers, however, compelled them to proceed. They were attacked by Baluchis. Pour soldiers were killed sitting in the lorries. Only one man me.de any attempt to fight and he was killed. Three fled. The Drivers were all wounded, three being unable to dfive, owing to wounds in the hand. One, wounded in the shoulder succeeded in returning on foot to Kwash. No attempt was made to bring in the others for four days, after which they were taken to the Military Hospital at Kwash.

The situation on the Khor ass an*-Afghan fronti er has been disturbei throughout the month* Some two or three months a detachment of G-endarmes in the Zurabad district incensed the local Baluchis and Taimuris by molesting their women folk. They attacked the Gendarmes killing 5 and making three prisoners. The tribes then fled to Afghanistan leaving their household goods and grain. Amir Jan an influential Baluchi ( son of a British subject formerly of Nushki) was nominal Sarhaddar of this district. Although he had no connection with the incident described above, he was summoned to Sarakhs about a month ago and died there under circumstances which led his tribe to believe that he had been poisoned by the iiiiitary authorities who were beginning to fear his influence on the border. Rearing that the Baluchis who had emigrated would raid Persian territory, the G-.O.C. Meshed appointed one Baud Khan to succeed Amir Jan, and ^armed the tribesmen* On receipt of the news of the death of Amir J&amp;n* Daud Khan raised the tribes under him ( all of which are Sunnis and have recently suffered under the Persian Shiah officials) looted the Shiah villages in the district and fled to Afghanistan# About the same time the other emigrants raided into Pepsin t»o recover the grain and effects .'.hich they had left behind* *ihey took the opportunity to loot any Shiah villages in their way# Their entry into Afghan istan was not opposed, but there is not any evidence uo show that their action was encouraged, and it wras the direct result of oppression by the Persian Officials* This incident gave rise to a violent campaign in the Persian press against the Afghans# Apart from this incident Perso-Afghan relations have been strained as a result of the operations of the Frontier Gommiss- ion* The Persian members of the Commission are said to have been stoned by Afghan occupants of territory which the Commission ordered them to evacuate in favour of Persia* Reports have come to hand of unrest in the neighbourhood of Lake Namaksar and again between iezd and Tabas&gt; but details are lacking# There have been continual movements of troops from Meshed towards the Afghan frontier, ana some reports indicate that there has existed a state of preparation ..or some time at Herat, lorries for transport having been collected there* The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs made a visit to Khorassan and pi-oceeded to the frontier to see Fakr-ud-Din Pasha, Head oj- the Boundary Commission,, The latter had paid a visit to Kabul just before the meeting* 5* FHRSIAN OFFICIALS» Sarhang Atapur arrived at Meshed on the1st to inspect the Khorassan Brigade* Bar hang G-hulam All, Chief of the Grendarnieri e $ also inspected the G-endarmerie in Khorassan, Dr Ahya-ud-Bonileh Shaikh, formerly itfart&gt;iion)],i Kunicipal Superintendent and Chief Health Officer of Tehran has 'been appointed Mayor of Meshed, Imperial Bank of Persia, has been appointed as Head'of the Agricultural Sank at Meshed hy the Persians, years ago was Persian representative in Moscow, is apparently intimate with the present Soviet Consul married in Italy, Aminzadeh, Persian Consul at Askahad has recently 'been in Meshed.

The Sardar of QASAR ( iAITD ^cith six other Sardars and their followers amounting to some 700 in all , &lt;i , , • *, 1 i . occupied the hi is near CHAIT ( 40 miles south of EAMFtra). At the ‘beginning of the month Persian troops (300 from TRAITSHAER and 400 from KH7ASH} attacked them unsuccessfully and fifty casualities ( indue -ing 3 Sardars) are reported on either side. The troops thereupon captured about 400 sheep and goats and 200 camels and donkeys from the grazing grounds and sent them in to IRANSHAJEU Later two more unsuccessful attacks were made on the rebels and now reinforcements are said to have been sent from KTTRMAE* (2) (Reference Para 1 (1) May 1934). Sardar JIATTD KHAN, Yarmohamadaai, and his two sons and a nephew have now been arrested and incarcer ated in Khwash. It is gathered that the Sardar and his tribesmen were caught colls cting foodstuffs with a view to trying to return to British liashkel. In march 1934 he surrendered himself to the Persians after two years in British territory. (Refs Para 1 March Diary). (3) (Reference January 1934 Diary).

The Baluchis took all the money they could lay hands on and then fled to the hills where they await the Persian troops who are at present occupied elsewhere. The Sardars concerned refused to accept the General Officer Oo roman dings order to proceed to KHEASH.

U) In conversation the Governor-G-eneral (BAERALIl) informed me he had represented to Tehran in the strongest terms the undesirability of attempting to stage the Firdausi celebrations in I3ESKED* TEHRAN would be a suitable place for the entertainment of the large number of European Orientalists who have been invited by the Persian Government* At last someone has realised the shortcomings of the Tehran-Meshed road stages and of meshed itself Incidentally the Governor-General feels that the design of the Firdausi Memorial itself at TOUS pS FO j&gt;o is wrong as it is of Grecian and not of Persian architectural style* He is equally scornful of the design for the Memorial to Omar Khayam at Mishapur* Thousands of workmen are working overtime on the various works (Hospitals, Roads, etc,) which are hoped to be ready for the Shat^s visit*4* PEBSIAIm lilLITXRT In Meshed of two Jewish conscripts who were accused in the Military Court of having given information on Military matters to the Soviet Consul G-eneral here, one has 'been sentenced to death* 5* COMMUNICATIONS.

In the afternoon a garden party was held in the Consulate grounds and some 100 persons attended. No Persian Officials (other than those who attended the mDBning reception or non-Officials were allowed to appear* At Sahidan and Birjand there were similar receptions in the morning together with similar restrictions, as regards Persian subjects.

There were repercussions in Zahidan where the Head Office is located, but there the local Officials, Banks, and merchants got together and agreed to a years moratorium.5 0 KHORASSAH.

MIR ALI NAWAZ KHAN of KHAIRPUR with 100 followers arrived at Zahidan where he was given a solemn reception by the Persian authorities. At MIEJATTA his party had beer granted Complete freedom from customs examination. He reached BIRJAND on the 17th where he was met semi-officially by the Officiating Governor and Persian Officials. Military guards turned out and presented arms as he passed the barracks on his way to the house of the Shaukat al Hulk (then at Khedri on his way to Birjand). On the 20th evening H.H. and party reached SKARIFABAD where they camped priol? to a semi-royal entrance to the Holy City of MESHED on the next day (Thursday 22nd June).

(Sartip ABBAS KHAN ALBUBZ) sent Sardar HYBER AL T KURD of Sistan who is in favour and hopeful of getting possession of the local property and karezes of IDU KHAN (now in Isfahan) with 100 of his troops to Persian Mashkel to recover arms from the Yarmuhammadzais* There was considerable resistance and 40 Baluchis are reported to have been killed before the remainder escaped into British Mashkel. The Sardar together with Sardar HABIBULLAH KHAN RBKI were then fcent to Mashkel and Mekran with the idea of persuading Persian Baluchis to return to Persia. They were unsuccessful in their mission. About 200 rifles from near K0HAK were recovered by Persian troops. These weapons were sent to BAKHSHAN (3) (4) 2. SISTAN AND KAIN . (1) The SHAUKAT UL MULK is still in Tehran though his early return was intimated confidentially by ASADI (Mutuwali Bashi of the Meshed Shrine). (2) Except that Persian Officials in Zabul are involved in acrimonious quarrelling amongst themselves there is nothing to report. Soon after the return of ASADI (Mutawalli Bashi of the Meshed Shrine) from Tehran it was reported that his estates near Birjand had been exchanged by the Persian Government for those of the QASHQAI tribes round Shiraz esome (1) The market remains stagnant. (2) Bain persisted to the end of the month and fears were expressed as to its effect on the Opium harvest, on which many hopes depend. (3} ISADI, Mutuwalli Bashi of the Meshed Shrine returned from Tehran on the 1st May. In anticipation of H.I.M. the Shah*s visit in the autumn frantic efforts are Being made to complete the many and various works under construction. (4) Encounters Between Persian troops and Afghan raiders and Turkoman smugglers persisted with some success to the Persians. (5) M.Jacmain, the popular Belgian Provincial Director of Customs received the circular notice of dismissal of all Belgian Custom Officials on the 13th, and having handed over to the Persian (local) Director left for Tehran on the 24th. His successor is too scared to sign documents, But is he must^he affixes a minute signature hoping that it will pass un-noticed : (6) 38 Khirgiz and 24 Turkoman families of refugees from Russia were Brought into Meshed on the 21*t May. (^ ) Because only 75% of the 40,000 sheep Belonging to the Kuchan, Bajgiran, and Darejaz Kurds returned from Russian grazing grounds and as these had Been shorn By the Russians, future grazing must he found in Persian Turkoman plains. (8) On the 17th May the Governor-General (BljRAMI) visited NI3HAPUR for a couple of days to speed up work on Omar Khayam^s tomB and on a new avenue in the town.

(2) ZUBIN (erroneously reported as ZAKOEB) the sinister Interpreter was given 24 hours to leave Meshed after certain anonymous letters containing allegations against the local Chief of Police had 'been traced to him* (3) The Soviet representatives in Meshed are far from popular with the Governor-General who finds Russian methods of trading, propaganda and espionage, much too intricate and widespread for his peace of mind. 7 0 AEGEAN AFFAIRS* M.AKRAM KHAN, my Afghan colleague, congratulated me on the deaprture from Meshed for Tehran or elsewhere of the 600 odd families of Jewish refugees from Russia* He seemed to 'be relieved 'by their departure.

Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad, The area continued quiet. Sardar Jiand Khan, Yarmohammadzai, who had migrated to British territory in 1932, returned to Khwash and surrendered himself to the Persians. He has been kept iir Khwash pending orders from Tehran. The Rais-i-Tip is said to have told him that he would not be given any trouble. Sardar Habibullah Khan Reki has been put under surveillance and is not allowed to leave Khwash. He is suspected of instigating the Baluchis against the Persians. Sardar Ibrahim Khan, Ismailzai and a few Baluchis of Saravan have been arrest ed for being in possession of rifles . The Shah is said! to 1 have told Idu Khan and his sons who are still in Tehran that they will not be allowed to go to Khwash, but if they wish they can take their fami lies to Tehran. Idu Khan has asked his family to go to Tehran and they are think ing it over. 2. Sistan and Kain. In Birjand the rumour is current that the Shaukat-ul-Mulk who is now in Tehran is to accompany H. I. M. the Shah on his coming visit to Iraq and Turkey, and that on his return the Shaukat will be appointed Governor-General of a new province to include Sistan and Persian Baluchistan. 3. Khorassan. Trade remains depressed and ill feeling against the Russians and their business methods continues. Many of the Turko man refugees who came into Persia last : autumn have succumbed to the rigors of j the winter. After an encounter with Soviet frontier guards some 250 families of Yamut Turko mans entered Persia on the 19th March ^ and were later taken to Bujnurd and thence to near Gumbad-i-Kabus on the Khorassan - Astarabad provincial border. Except for an incident on the Perso- Afghan frontier at Kariz in which a band of robbers attacked the Persian Amnieh (Road Guards) killing and wounding eivht including an Officer (wounded), nothing untoward occurred. 4. Army Department. L As is customary a number of much welcomed (Persian) New Year promotions amongst Army Officers were announced on the 21st March. 2 . Th 6 Headquarters of the Persian Baluchistan Brigade is to be moved from Khwash to Zahidan and new buildings are to be built therefor. 5. Communications. }n Sistan the work on the Naurab bridge was completed by the 10th March and it should be open for use a month later, whilst other bridges are to be planned and built by the summer. ■ * 6- H. M. Consular Officers. Lieutenant-Colonel C. K. Daly, C.I.E., and Headquarters staff arrived Meshad irom Zabul via Birjand on the 13th March, and on the INth handed over officiating charge to Major E. H. Gastrell (who had f / om Bus . hire via Tehran on the 16th) before leaving for Tehran en route tor leave in the United Kingdom. Captain H.

(Sartip Iraj Khan), Chiefs of Police and Municipality, an d the Soviet and Afghan Consul Generals. 7. Soviet Affairs. Zakoff Interpreter to the Consulate General has been refused admission to the various Persian Departmental offices. His visits aroused suspicion and the Consul- General has been informed by the Governor-General that they should be con fined to official business with the Governor- General only. Branches of the Soviet trading concerns have been opened at Kuchan, Shirwan, Baigu-an Bui nurd, Nishapur, Sabzawar, and Turbat-i-Haidan. As it is suspected tliat these branches are merely blinds to shelter G. P. U. activities the local police have arranged for their special supervi sion. 1 On the 29th the Consul-General left at short notice for Askabad. (He returned on the 3rd April). 8 . Afghan Affairs. Mr. Akram Khan, Afghan Consul elect ?r a0 V passed through Zahidan on the Uh March. ENGLOSUHE IN INDIA FOREIGN S ,: ^« CTftWV, B ‘ L tf -r V l Cat. y M-5V ]Q7*9. Miscellaneous. Birthday of H. I.

The Police took an active part in persuading people to participate and to decorate their houses, shops, cars, lorries, and bicycles at their own expense. The local authorities made no grants in aid. Export of silver to India. —The Zahidan firm of Shoraka exported some 26,000 lbs. of silver in bars during March. As before the bullion was in transit from Qasr-i- Shirin. Smuygling. —Reports show that the traffic continues in as large degree as ever. A commission under a Persian ColoJ^ arrived in Meshad from Tehran at the 4* * of March and it is suspected that it will investigate the smuggling in addition to census matters. . E. H.

Pekstan Baluchistan and the Sarhad. This area has been unusually quiet. 2. Ststan and the Qainat. Shaukat-Ul-Mulk has proceeded to Tehran on a visit. Local rumour has it mat he will be appointed Governor- General of Sistan, Kain and Persian Baluchistan. It is known that H. I. M. the Shah has previously offered him appointments which he has hitherto declined. He is now however yeiy short of money and might be prevailed upon to accept an appointment. His nephew Hisam-Ud-Dowleh, Governor of Kain, has been granted leave of absence and left for India via Zahidan. He proposes to proceed to Syria and tiom there possibly to France and England. A Survey party under Sartip Abdul Reza Khan-Muhandis-ul-Mulk arrived at Zabul on 25th February. They are to survey the Perso-Afghan frontier, particularly that portion which is the subject of dispute. There is no nows of the Afghans having sent a party. The Sartip is assisted by six otheis and they have a number of mules, servants and a lorry. The use of the lorry is not apparent as they cannot take it near the frontier. There is much talk among the leading Sardais of Sistan regarding the possibility of their emigrating to Afghan territory. 3. Khorasan. The trade of this Province is reported as being worse than a year ago. There have been several important bankruptcies mainly due to gambling on exchange. 4. Military Affairs. For the first time for some years the pay of the police at Zabul has fallen in arrears. They have received no pay for three months and individual policemen have been seen begging in the bazaar. Their uniforms are also in a deplorable state. Two hundred gendarmes who were sent to the Russian frontier in Khorasan some months ago have been relieved. One hundred and sixty men have now been distributed as under— Bajcdran 30 - Lutfabad 20—Kalat 20—Khaf 60—Bakharz 30. It is learnt that the Meshad Brigade is once more to be increased by a Regiment. This increase will take place after 20th March. It will be known as the 31 st Regiment and will consist entirely ot Infantry. The Artillery is also to be increased. After April Iso new barracks are to be built for these additional troops in the Sheher-i-Nau quarter of the town. Attention has been previously drawn in these diaries to the steady increase in the armed forces in East Persia. The Police Head Quarters which have hitherto been ar Birjand are to be transferred to Zahidan and both Zabul and Birjand will be directed from that place. 5. Persian Officials, At long last a Peace Court has been opened at Zahidan and Shaik-Ul-Rais has arrived there to act as the Peace Court judge. This combined with the transfer to Zahidan of Police Head Quarters may improve the lot of the many British Indian subjects whose cases have suffered great delay by reason of their being transferred to Zabul or Birjand. There have been somo disgraceful cases of Britisn Indian subjects being kept for months in custody at Zahidan without trial. These cases have been the subject of separate correspondence with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Mirza Hasan Khan Badi has been appointed Persian Consul General at Herat. This change may be connected with the complaints we have made regarding unjust treatment ot British Lorry drivers by the late Consul General. ENCLOSURE IN 1 INDIA FORET&gt; ScCRpTaRY'S , v , rg j 1? A PR1934 H 0 PR.Dawoodi, Public Prosecutor at Meshad, has been appointed a member of the Hiprh Court at Isfahan. Afshar, Public Works Officer for East Persia, has been touring at Zahidan and Zabul. 6. Russian Affairs. Two Russian retugees who absconded from Birjand last montb have not yet been traced. Muhammad Karim and Iskandar—two Caucasian refugees—have been arrested at Meshad as G. P. U. agents and de ported to Russia. It is said that all the Caucasians at Meshad are suspect and likely to be deported. Two Persian Armenians named Hartpon and YarkofF, who frequently visited the Soviet Consulate General, have been arrested at Meshad and sent to Tehran under escort. 7. Afghan Affairs. There has been further trouble at Meshad regarding passports issued by the Afghan Consul General. The Persians t retused to recognise 16 pas sports which they alleged had been issued to Persian subjects. The matter has been referred to Tehran. Afghan tribesmen who normally graze their flocks in the Qainat during the spring are reported to have come there in greater numbers than usual. As they engage actively in smuggling and last year, had several clashes with the gendarhierie, steps have been taken to limi^ their movements and arms have been issued to Persian tribes in the locality to enable them to keep them in order. The Afghan Consul at Zabul appar ently finds it difficult to maintain easy relations with the Persian officials. He is a most inoffensive old man and it would seem that Officiale in the provinces are following a determined policy in making matters difficult for the Afghans. This attitude is particularly noticeable in East Persia of late. A few years ago officials were most obliging to the Afghan Consuls—more so in fact than to Biitish Consuls—but the reverse has been the ease for the last 18 months or two years, and the situation appears to be slowly deteriorating for the Afghans. 8. Communications. The bridge over the Naurab near Zabul i^ nearing completion and will be opened for traffic cfficially at the New Year. The Engineer in charge haa^, obligingly offered to permit H. M. ConsuL General to use it before the official opening. A contract has been placed tor bricks for the construction of the large bridge which remains to be built over the Sheila on the Zabul-Zahidan road. M. Ekker, Hungarian engineer in charge of this work, has recently re aligned the road from Lutak to the Sheila. His alignment has been followed by H. M. Consul-General on a recent tour to Zahidan. It cannot be said to be a happy one since it traverses for several miles low sandy hills. They are covered with &amp;mall stones which make it passable for light cars for a few journeys but the soil underneath is ver^ light and will rapidly become impassable. It is un likely that the light metalling it is proposed to use in this area will stand traffic as it will sink into the sand. The route has one advantage inasmuch as it avoids the area liable to annual inunda tion. The Meshad-Birjand and Meshad- ‘ Tehran roads were rendered impassable tor several days during the month bv heavy snow. * A lorry conveying 40 pilgrims from Meshad to Tehran skidded on the Firuz Kuh and fell over the precipice. AH the travellers are reported to have been killed. 9. Smuggling. Reports continue to be received from all districts to the effect that smuggling into Persia is rife all along the frontier. | 10. Foreign Travellers. Zahid Agaisnoff, U. S. A. citizen, arrived at Zahidan from India and proceeded to Tehran. II. H. M. Consular officers. Captain Galloway on transfer to Bush ire left Zahidan on 7 th February. Major Rivett Carnac transferred from Aden assumed charge of H. M. Vice Consulate Zahidan on 20 th.. 3 12. Miscellaneous News. Silver continues to be sent into India viz Zahidan having been declared in transit through Persia. To this trade , l^fcS now been added that of Japanese silk large consignments of which are landed at the Gulf ports and transported to Zahidan. The following table shows I recent exports :— Silver Japanese Week ending. weight in silk wt. in lbs. lbs. January, 30th . 5,860 6.500 February, 6th . . . 7,800 Nil. February, 13th . 4,650 Nil. February, 20th . 7,800 7.800 The above are the gross weight of packages declared in the Customs, liegular consignments of Japanese silk are said to be en route. The Head of Police at Zahidan re cently stopped issuing long-term visas to Indian drivers on the Zahidan-Kundi road. He at first said tl at he had receive I orders from Tehran to refuse visas and Residency permits to drivers recently arrived from India. By this it is presumed that the arrangement shonlJ not apply to drivers who do not normally reside in Persia or it may be intended to restrict such visas to Indian drivers who were in Persia when the reciprocal arrangement for such visas was made. It is probable that some effort is to be made to restrict Indian drivers working on this route in favour of Persians. Later the Chief of the Police stopped issuing any visas at all to drivers, saying that he was awaiting further instructions from Tehran. At a later date he declared that he could issue no visas as he had run out of stamps. r lhe situation is being watched. If it transpires that restrictions are to be placed on Indian drivers our own arrangements for issuing long-term visas to persians entering India under the same conditions will require to be revised. 13. Municipal. The new Mayor of Meshad is proving to be the proverbial ‘ new broom ’. New clo thing has been ordered for the inmates of the Lunatic Asylum who are also to be medically inspected weekly. Special regulations have been issued regarding the sanitation of Slaughter Houses and the unrestricted washing of clothes in the canals of the town is being curtailed. C. K. DALY, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General, Khorasan. •i - His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate General, Khorasan. (Including Sistan and Kain, Zahidan AND THE SARHAD.) Locust report for the month of February 1934. A report was received at Meshad to the effect that locusts had deposited eggs in the Tabas district and an official was sent to investigate. No further report has yet been received. The Ministry of the interior of the Persian Government has issued a circular telegram to Provincial Governors stating that the most effective method of pre venting eggs from hatching out is to till the soil. Accordingly instructions have GIPD—660(0, FAPD—5-4-34-30. been sent to all villages to till the soil in areas where eggs are known to have been deposited. As however eggs are usually deposited in uncultivated areas little result can be expected and in any case it is unlikely that the petty officials in villages will adequately carry out these orders. Probably owing to the severity of the winter-cold weather having commenced later and lasted longer than is usual there have been no reports of locusts seen in the Sarhad or Persian Baluchis tan from which area they are usually first reported the swarms subsequently flying north.

The Registration Department (Sijjil-i-Ahval) has opened offices at Kwash and Iransheher. The Rekis are said to be registering, but in the neighbourhood of Iransheher the Baluchis have all fled to the hills. Estimators have arrived at Kwasb and Iransbeher and are measuring crops and counting date palms. It would appear that taxes are to be collected and that the promise given to the Baluchis a few years ago that they would not be taxed is likely to be broken. The shop of one Madan -a British Indian subject-—at Iransheher was re cently broken open and a sum of Tomans three thousand stolen. Tne shop owner has strong suspicions against men of the local garrison. He reported the matter to the General Officer Commanding who has apparently declined to take up the case. Madan is said to intend to visit Zahidan to appeal to H. M.’s Vice- Council. Lashker Khan—Reki, has rebelled and is in hiding near the frontier between Jalk and Sotagan. He has a following of about three hundred men. He has refused to submit and it is believed that military action against him has been threatened. acted as ‘ Keeper of the Frontier Pro perty listed by the Frontier Commissary amounted, in addition to the rifles, to — | '■ 3,30^ camels. 150 cows. 3.000 sheep. 7.000 Tomans in cash. 3 / f Perso-Afghan Frontier in Sistan. It is sfcated in Sistan that the Persians claim that the Afghans have, during late years, encroached on Persian territory and that the frontier should be some ten miles further East. The Boundary Pillars used to be mait.tained by the British Consulate at Sistan, but this ceased early in the present regime in Persia. If encroachment has, in fact taken place it can only have occurred within the past tew years. It is said that a fuither Commission is to vis-it Sistan soon to negotiate with the Afghans in this matter. r J his may indicate that the question of the Helmand river is to be reopened—in which case the claim for rectification of the frontier may be a political move preceding negotiation. The continual increase of Military garrisons, Amnieh, Frontier Guards and ‘ Customs ’ guards which has taken place near the Persian frontier since the break down of the last negotiations is not without significance. Sistan and Qainat. Sardar Khudadad Khan the Chief of the Narohi Baluchis died on January 1 st. He had great influence, being regarded as the spiritual head of the Narohis, which sect is widely scattered in the South West of Afghanistan, Sistan, British Baluchistan and Sind. He was a power in the land before the Pahlevi regime and rendered valuable services to us during the Great War. A dispute has arisen among his heirs. Thirty *303 rifles were found in his house. His son stated that twenty of these were given to him by the British at the end of the War and the remaining ten were provided in pre-war days by t Shaukat U1 Mulk, on whose behalf he 2. Military Affairs. Medals have been granted to the troops who took part in the recent minor operations in Baluchistan. The G. O. C., Meshad Brigade recently visited Birjand to inspect the new buildings which are under construction to accommodate a full cavalry regiment. Sartip Azizullah Khan—Inspector of Gendarmerie recently carried out a tour in East Persia. Orders have been received at Meshad that policemen who have not performed their Military service are to be dismissed and in future only ex-soldiers to be employed. &gt;r~ Persian Officials. 3. Dabir Azam Bahraini has been appointed Governor-General of Khcra- san. Some time ago he held the ap pointment ol Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. He has also been previously Governor General of Isfahan and of Shiraz. Khoje Nuri—Mayor of Mesh ad is to be transferred. The new Governor General is said to have secured the pos^ for a relative—a tactful arrangement since the Municipal Funds of Mfesbad have long been regarded as the only satisfactory source of unofficial income for the Governor General. K uri was the protege of the late Governor-General. Sarhang (Colonel)'Pasha Khan—Chief of Police has been touring in Khorasan. Changes among the junior officials in East Persia are so frequent that it would require some pages of this Diary to enumerate them. No official appears to stay more than a few months in his post and it seems almost a matter of policy that they should be continually moved. It cannot fail to seriously affect efficiency. Russian Affairs. 4. The Police Department is said to be negotiating for the purchase of the Russian Consulate at Zabul, which they want for Head Quarters and a prison. The Soviet post at Artiq on the Khorasan Frontier is said to effect the arrest of several smugglers daily. They are handed over to the Persian Fiontier Commissar at Lutfabad where they are imprisoned. Three cinema films imported by the Soviet Consulate General in Knorasan were examined by the Police and found to be for propaganda purposes. They were confiscated and sent to Tehran. The new Soviet Consul-General arrived at Meshad on January 4th from Moscow. He is an Armenian from Baku and was Consul at Tabriz 1923-26, after which he woiked in the Political Bureau, Baku. He speaks Persian, Turkish, some Urdu and a little English. His name is M. Sarkisbekov. He called at His Majesty’s Consulate General on arrival. Two Russian refugees who had opened a carpenters shop opposite the Police Station at Birjaud, recently disappeared. They were supposed to report to the Police daily, but the shop hid been closed five days before their deperture was discovered. They were clev^*. workmen and had taken a considerable sum of money in advance for work. They had also borrowed plant and tools of considerable value from Hisam-Ud- Dowleh. They have not been traced. Afghan Affairs. 5 . On a report that a party of 50 Afghans were about to raid Daroksh—a village in the vicinity of Birjand—the police issued the inhabitants with ten rifles and 1,000 rounds of ammunition. r lhe raid did not take place. Relations between the Afghan Consul- j General at Mesned and the Governor- General have been very strained lately. It appears that the former has been issu ing passports to Persian subjects. Refugees. 6 . Sultan Ashrafi, Chief of Police at Kuchan has been sent to Tehran under arrest. He is said to have released a number of Kurd and Russian prisoners on receiving bribes. The prisoners es caped to Russia. Up till January 4th the Soviet Jewish refugees at Meshad were being sent to Hamadan and Kazvin at the rate of 30 a day. On the 4th instructions were received that the remainder might stay at Meshad for three months after which they would be sent to the above mention ed places. Communications. 7. The road from Daghdai to Qileh Mina is being repaired. Four miles have been completed and the work is expected to take another four months. A new bridge is being constructed on the Bajgiran Road near Durbadam. 8. Export of Silver to India via Zahidan. Week ending January 2nd — Bar silver weighing 28 Kharvars Tabrizi.

His Britannic Majesty^s Consulate General for Khorasan Diary for the month of December 1933. 1. Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad. Towards the end of November troops attacked the Sardar of Bakshan. The local tribesmen had undertaken to sup port the Sardar, but fled on the approach of the troops, leaving a garri son of 80 only in the fort. Having refused to surrender, the fort was attacked by Artillery and reduced. Twelve were killed in the bombardment and 62 Baluch tribesmen were put to death by the bayonet. 100 rifles were captured. Abdul Hussain, the recalcitrant Ramishk sardar is reported to have sur rendered unconditionally. By the middle of December all troops engaged in these operations had returned to Kwash. Only the Sardars of Qanuj and Qasrarqand are now in a state of rebellion. The latter came in to Kwash but rejected the terms offered by the General Officer Commanding. No further operations are contemplated this winter. The General Officer has been ordered to destroy the Kwash fort, which was erected by the British troops. It is in a serviceable condition and in fact the only strong point in possession of the troops there. A side-light is thrown on the present day mentalitv of the Persians in that he has also been told to cut down every tree planted there by the British troops. These trees were the onlv pleasing feature in some thousands of square miles of desolate country. 2. SlSTAN AND KAIN. A commission of officials of the Registration Department has been sent to Fariman to determine the boundaries of the property recently acquired there by H. I. M. The Shah. Local land- owners are apprehensive of the results. 4. The Army Department. Twenty-two machine guns were recently sent to Kwash. One hundred and fifty men have been selected for training with these weapons. 100 Conscripts who had completed their training, recently returned to Zabul. They had to pay their own expenses for the journey from Kwash. In Khorasan 350 cavalry and 4 mountain guns have been concentrated at Gumbad-i-Kabus, near the Atrak river, on the frontier and a further 250 cavalrv and two guns from Astrabad have been sent to the same locality. This is a reply to the Soviet Govern ment which has recentlv sent a number of troops there, ostensibly to deal with the Turkoman refugees, whose habit of removing their cattle to Persia is begin ning to alarm the Russians. 280 Conscripts from the Nishapur district were sent to Tehran on 23rd December. On December 3rd a Soviet aeroplane flying from Askabad to Merv passed over Persian territory near Bajgiran. This has been made the subject of a protest to the Soviet by the Persian Government. 190 Conscripts from Turshiz arrived at Meshad on 19th. The orders prohi biting Persian Officers from anv association with foreign women, parti cularly Russian refugees, have been reiterated. Vo The province has been quiet and nothing of importance has been reported. 3. Khorasan. Large numbers of pilgrims are pro ceeding to the Hedjaz and Iraq. Both at Meshad and Birjand some assistance is being afforded to the desti tute by the Red Lion and Sun Society. 5. Afghan Affairs. The Afghan Brigadier—now said to be Anwar Khan—who fled to Persia and was sent to Kwash, was immediate ly sent on to Tehran, presumably to be interrogated for intelligence purposes. Two Afghan smugglers carrying 11 rifles from ^Persia^to Afghanistan were apprehended by the Gendarmerie at Kariz. ENGLGSUrtb IN [ INDIA FOREIGN SECRFTaRY'S - Latter No 356. Persian Officials. The Telegraph Master at Zahidan has received instructions to discover a shorter alignment for the line from Kwash to Iransheher via Karvindah. Saba, Governor of Nishapur has been appointed to the Directorate of the Registration Department (Sijjil-i- Ahval) at Tehran. Yawar Godarzi, former Chief of Gendarmerie (Amniehb Birjand has been recalled to Meshad. Complaints against him are under investigation. He undoubtedly op pressed both Persians and foreigners alike, while at Birjand. A German doctor is shortly to be appointed to take charge of the new Shrine Hospital at Meshad, which institution it is expected will be opened by H. I. M. The Shah this spring. 7. Refugees. Two Russian refugees broke into the Consulate Kelateh at Birjand recently and stole certain articles of furniture. Thev were apprehended and the stolen goods recovered. These refugees in Kain are starving and can obtain no , employment at all'. During the past quarter 4,500 Yamut Turkomans with 50,000 sheep, 4,000 cows and 3.000 j camels, have entered Khorasan, from Russia. The 600 Soviet Jew refugees who have been concentrated at Meshad have hpen ordered to disperse to Ispahan, Kazvin, and Hamadan immediately. The gendarmerie post at Sarakhs has been increased by 25 men to deal with the continual flow of refugees in that locality. Forty Russian Jews who arrived via the Kalat frontier early in December were returned to Russia. r Four Russians entered Persia via Ralat on December 19th. They were without anv nationahtv documents. About 24 miles from Meshad they were met by a servant sent from the Soviet Consulate General at Meshad who endeavoured to conduct them to the Consulate. They were arrested and sent to Tehran and the servant is in jail at Meshad. This incident confirms the belief that the recent activity of the police in rounding up soviet agents has some what crippled the internal organisation and made it necessary to introduce fresh agents from Russia who are passed off as refugees. Orders have been received in Khorasan to the effect that in future all refugees are to be sent back to Russ^^ Such orders have been previou^^ 1 issued, from time to time, but are not acted upon, except in the cases of un fortunate persons who have insufficient means to bribe the petty frontier offi cials. Genuine refugees are thus likely to be turned back, whiel agents supplied with funds can easily enter Persia. 8. Soviet Affairs. A limited amount of trade has been \ resumed with merchants at Meshad. i Wool is the chief commodity purchased by the Russians. For some time no agreement could be arrived at as the merchants declined to sell on credit. It is not known upon what terms trade iwas resumed, by private individuals. 9. Municipalities. The cost of Health Officers and sani tation is in future to be met entirely from Municipal funds. On the other hand many sources of Municipal revenue have, in recent years, been ap propriated by the Treasury, so that none of the municipalities in East Persia is in a position to maintain health service. The Municipality of Meshad has collected 840 beggars for whom shelter, food, fuel and one blanket per person, is being provided for the winter. 10. Climatic. Throughout East Persia the winter has, so far. been exceptionally mild. Snow has fallen in Khorasan and Kain, 11 1 ^ oon melted. In Sistan no cold weather has been experienced, but abnormally early rains fell. 11. Foreign Travellers. («) Armais from India via Zahidan. E. A. Ewald Kruper—German— November 29th.

Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad. A report was received to the effect that Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai who has several times disobeyed the General- Officer’s command to present himself at Kwash, intends to emigrate to British territory. Two influential Mullahs—Bahrain of Bakshan and Hashim of Iransheher together with some servants of the late Dost Mahomed were recently arrested on accusation of spreading rumours to the detriment of the prestige of the Govern ment. They have been sent to Tehran under escort. Dilmurad Baranzai —a Sardar of Iran sheher who was responsible for the murder of two Persians last yjear was recently apprehended and shot. Sardar Habibullah Reki, who hopes to succeed Idu Khan in the favours of the G. 0. C. recently assembled 500 men and attacked the rebel Sardar Tajmuhammad. A considerable amount of booty was secur ed and handed, over to the troops at Kwash. Operations have commenced against Abdul Hussain of Remishk, but no details are yet known. Pressure has been brought on members of the Mohamadzai tribe to compel them to induce Jiand Khan to return from British Mashkel, but is unlikely to have any result. A report has been current in Baluchistan that Nowsherawan—brother of the late Dost Mahomed Khan recently died at Teheran. A few months ago four British Indian subjects arrived at Kwash from Panjgur. They intended to proceed on pilgrimage rm Persia. They were arrested for being without passports and were sent to Zahidan about two months ago. They are still not tried in any Court and a protest has been lodged with the local Governor by H. B. M.’s Vice-Consul. 2 . Khorasan. The supervision of the health of the Province has been transferred to the Meshed ^ Municipality from November 17th. Little or nothing has hitherto been done to improve the sanitation of the town of Meshed, so that the remainder of the province is likely to fare ill in this respect. I Owing to the removal of the ban on the pilgrimage to Kerbela and Meshed large numbers of pilgrims are applying for visas at the Consulate. A temporary respite has resulted from the fact that the stock of passports with the Persian authorities has been exhausted. The labour involved in checking all these passports is very con siderable and requires care since the Persians issue passports to practically any one who can pay the fees and it has been found that a large number of Russian jews have obtained Persian passports. 3. Sistan and Kain. The peasants of the Sheb-i-Ab district are refusing to cultivate the lands given them under the new distribution scheme. They complain that the land actually alloted to each person is less in area than is shewn in the Government records and demand that it be correctly measured. A good deal of the discontent is however deliberately fostered by the local Sardars who, having themselves been dispossessed of the land, have in many cases been ap pointed ‘ Mubashirs ’ or Overseers and Revenue Collectors. As they are directly inteiested in the failure of the present system of land tenure, which has deprived them of their livelihood, no more suicidal policy—than to appoint them as Over seers—can be imagined. 4. Persian Officials. Mehdi Quli Khan—Mukhtar As-Saltaneh ^ho_ was Reis-i-V uzareh in the last Cabinet, has been appointed Governor- General in Khorasan. Abdul Hussain Mirza—Chief of Police at Birjand has been transferred to Zahidan in the same capacity. He has proved very troublesome to British subjects at Birjand, but it is believed that he has been instruct ed to mend his ways in this respect. Sultan Taqi Khan—formerly Command ant ot Meshed prison, has been appointed Chief of Police at Zabul. Throughout the province there have, as usual, been a number of changes among the lesser officials, who seldom hold a post for more than a few months. So frequent are the changes that one may almost assume that it is part of a settled policy. 5. Afghan Affairs. II. M.’s Consul-General called at the Afghan Consulate-General before leaving Meshed to offer condolences in connection vitli the assasination ot the late Kin^ of Afghanistan. enclosure IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter ^ Date T U M 1334 ju. k*' i i&lt;iu42 Mahomed Rahim Khan—who held a high position in the Afghan Army at Herat and who was apparently suspected of pro- Amanullah tendencies recently arrived at Zabul. He had been summoned to Kabul, but fled the country. Under orders from Tehran he has been sent to Kwash to inter view the General Officer Commanding. He was accompanied by two sons and some servants, all of whom were heavily armed. 6 . Irrigation. Since the redistribution of land in Sistan the situation as regards irrigation has greatly deteriorated as insufficient control is exercised over the large number of independent cultivators. Large areas of land have been Hooded throughout the summer. The new road which is under construction has been much damaged and Malaria has spread to an alarming degree. Up to two years agx&gt; this disease was practically unknown in Sistan, but many hundreds of deaths from this cause occur red this year. Our Medical Officer is of opinion that, as the peasants have no immunity the district will be almost de populated in a few years unless measures are urgently undertaken to control the irrigation and combat the disease. Such Persian officials who have discussed the matter are apathetic. They refer to Mazanderan, but fail to realise that Malaria has always been endemic there and tiie people have acquired some degree of immunity which is not the case in Sistan. 7. Soviet Affairs. The anniversary of the Revolution was celebrated by the usual Reception at the Soviet Consulate-General. Some unofficial Persians who visited the Consulate after the morning reception were interrogated by the police and reported to Police Head quarters at Tehran. A cinematograph display was given in flie Consulate the following evening. H. M.’s Consul-General had been informed by the Soviet Vice-Consul that the film' had been imported with great difficulty and only on the understanding that it would not be displayed outside the Soviet Consulate and that it was a wonderful pro duction featuring the Revolution. H. M.’s (Consul-General did not personally attend the performance, but a member of the Consulate staff who was present described the film as fifth-rate and consisting of a few scenes of work in progress in Russian factories. The exhibition was very poorly attended—none of the leading Persian Officials being present. 8 . Ilis Majesty*s Consular Officers. Captain Galloway, H. M.’s Vice-Consul, Zahidan, paid a short visit to Meshed to present himself for an examination in Persian. H. M.’s Officiating Consul- General with the Headquarters staff arriv ed in Zabul for the winter on 24th Novem ber. 9. British Travellers. Lieutenant-Colonel Noel, D.S.O 4 with a party of seven and two cars recently pro ceeded to India via Meshed and Herat. They had interminable difficulties at Meshed in connection with exit visas, transit visas, funds for the journey, etc* Mr. R. Byron—a member of the Goldman expedition who had become weary of await ing the- expedition at Tehran, preceded it to Meshed and accompanied Colonel Noel as far as Herat. Mr. E. Hawkins—a publisher—arrived at Zahidan on November 8 th and proceeded to England via Tehran and Russia. 10 . Foreign Travellers. S. J. Sheri—Iraqian Jew of the firm of Menashi Heskel Mashal of Kermanshah, arrived at Zahidan on 21st and proceeded to Bombay. His firm is actively engaged in exporting silver to India via Nok-Kundi. 11 . Customs Evasion. Silver in bars, weighing 4,550 lbs. was sent to Nok-Kundi by the firm of Shuraka, Zahidan, on 19th November. The consign ment was booked to Bombay and had been received by post at Zahidan, having been declared in transit at Qasr-i-Shirin. Most of the silver received at Zahidan for on ward despatch by this route appears to be handled by the National Bank of Persia whose agents undertake the forwarding. During the week ending 7th November another consignment of 348,000 lbs. pf sdver was similarly exported. C. K. DALY, Ilis Britannic Majesty , s Officiating Consul-General for Khorasan. J.c&amp;HFD— 32 — 9 - 1-3 i -r,I?S Jmamm CONFIDENTIAL. 1. Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad. Operations are pending against the two rebel Sardars Taj Muhammad and Abdul Hussain (of Remishk). Six minor Sardars of the Kuh-i- Bampusht area arrived at Kwash early in October to assist the Persian troops in the intended attack on Taj Muhammad. The latter is reported to have collected a force of about 500. For the operations against Remishk the cavalry available at Zabul have been moved to Kwash and a quantity of machine guns and ammunition recently arrived from Tehran. Negotiations are being carried on with Abdul Hussain and there seems some prospect of his surrendering as he is re ported to have accepted conditions offerer! him, but no definite information is yet available. Sardar Habibullah Khan Reki, who has always been a rival of Idu Khan, is op pressing members of the latter’s family and the Baluchis of his section of the tribe. It is stated that his action is connived at by the G. 0. C. and that once all influential members of his following have been remov ed Habibullah will take possession of Idu’s landed property. The general im pression being that idu Khan will never be permitted to return from Tehran. Mahmud Khan and Shahnoor, Tdu’s nephews, and Rodin, an influential follower, were arrested early in October and were to be sent to Tehran under escort. Six others were ordered to Kwash but fled. All Idu’s property, household effects, etc., have been listed and a N. 0. 0. put in charge. His wives are sent for every week and detained some hours and pres sure is brought upon them to disclose the place in which Idu is alleged to have con cealed his money. A stone wall built round his house was demolished and the ground dug to three feet in an endeavour to discover the treasure. . Idu having asked for 3,000 Tomans to be sent to him his relations are disposing of his camels which were in British Mashkel. The fate of Tdu is still a further example of the common end of all Persians who diligently serve their country. Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai was sum moned to Kwash but pleaded illness. Lo594FD His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate General for Khorasan, Political Diary for the \ month of October 1933. 2 . Sistan and Kain. There have been no political occurrences of note. 3. Khorassan. The climate owing to sudden and violent changes of temperature has been very try ing, and there is an abnormal amount of sickness. In Meshed some 70—80 per cent, of the inhabitants are reported to be suffering from mild influenza and pul monary diseases. Great hopes of a revival of trade and the abolition of the ^Monopoly Law are based on the formation of the new Cabinet, the constitution of which is favourably regard ed. 4. Persian Officials. Abdul Hussain and Abbas Khan, formerly employed in the Revenue Depart ment of Baluchistan and Zabul respective ly have been sent to Tehran to be tried for embezzlement. Mohamed Miftah, Chief Revenue Officer of Khorassan was summoned to Tehran on the 15th and Tahish, Revenue Officer, from Isfahan has taken his place. Abdul Hussain Mirza, Head of Police, Birjand, has been transferred to Zahidan and relieved by Ali Khan Jehan Bin. The former has proved very troublesome to British subjects recently. It is strange that he has retained his post as he was an avowed supporter of Teymourtache and is a relation by marriage. Yawar Qumani, Assistant to the Reis-i- Amnieh (Gendarmerie) in Khorassan, who had recently arrived at Meshed has been transferred to Birjand. This transfer is the result of an occur rence concerning this Consulate-General. This young Officer, who apparently suffers from an exaggerated view of his own importance, recently grossly insulted the Persian Munshi of this Consulate-General who had been sent to see the Chief of the Amnieh. The insult was so un-called for, that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General took the matter up with the Chief of the Amnieh and the General Officer Commanding and demanded an unqualified apology. The apology was duly made in the presence of those who had witnessed the insult and the matter closed, but a few days later the G. O. C. sent a message to the effect that the Officer had been trans ferred and warned to be more careful in future./ i Mir Masmn Khan, a former Governor of bistan, was appointed Acting Governor- General in Kliorassan on the 13th October, ie is a pleasant gentleman, if somewhat weak tea ”, and appears to wish to be as obliging as circumstances will admit. Sarhang Nawai, Chief of the Police in Gast I ersia proceeded to Tehran on 21 st October, nominally on leave, but it is under stood he will retire. He is not on good terms with his Chief in Tehran. He has been tor many years in Meshed, and was very much the ‘ red-tape ’ Official—latterly proved very unreasonable in his dealings with British subjects. \ a war Muhommad Ali Khan Intizami has been appointed his successor. The latter recently returned from Tehran v hei e he had been called to receive verbal insti actions. ffiiere are grounds for believing that he was instructed to take particular care in regard to British sub jects and to minimise cause for justifiable complaints. Sultan Abul Hassan Khan was recently sent to Meshed to investigate a number of complamts which had been made against the Gendarmerie Officer there, Yawar Godarzi. fie is accused of accepting bribes, but as none of the persons called m his presence, gave any evidence, no action against him is likely. 5. Military. ^Yawar Khaberzadeh, Chief Accountant ol the Baluchistan Brigade has taken to 1 eh ran all accounts outstanding against lawar Sikandar Khan and Naib Mahmud Khan, both of whom were suspended two years ago for alleged embezzlement. Nevertheless it is stated that the former has already been reinstated and given an appointment in Tehran, as also his brother- n Sartip Mahomed Khan (former G. 0. C. m the Sarhad). 450 conscripts from Meshed were called up on the 26th October. The cavalry detachment at Zabut has been sent to Kwash presumably to garrison the place during the operations against the rebel Baluchis. 6 . Refugees. On the 22nd October, 115 Russian and Caucasian refugees were sent to Isfahan. 350 families of Turkoman refugees arriv- October 10laSSan Jrom ^ uss| a during 7. Soviet Affairs. The Soviet Consul-General who proceed ed some months ago on “ short leave ” to Russia has not returned and there seems every likelihood that the post will remain vacant during the winter. At a recent Raee-meeting held by the Khorassan Brigade to which Consular Officers and Staffs were invited it was seen that no notice at all was taken of the Russian Vice-Consul and his staff by the Persian Officials. The members of H. B. M.’s Consulate- General were, however, cordially greeted. 8 . Communications. The Zabul-Zahidan is temporarily im passable owing to floods, and the new road under construction has been damaged. It is part of the scheme to construct a canal to carry the surplus water to the depression known as Gaud-i-Zirieh, but this work should have preceded the con struction of the new road. As a result of putting the cart before the horse the new road was severely damaged last winter and has again been washed away in several places. The telegraph and telephone line from Meshed to Fariman (the village recently bought by H. I. M. The Shall) was coni- on 2oth October and a telegraph office opened. The road has also been metalled. It is anticipated that the Shah will soon visit Khorassan to inspect his newly acquired property. 9. Lawlessness. QuU, Mamu. and Nasrullah Khan, three ot the ring-leaders of a gang of robbers who have been operating in the Bujnurd- feabzavar districts were recently captured and executed by order of a Court-martial. 10 . Foreign Travellers. Herr Scholz, German subject, accom panied by his wife, recently visited East ersia and left Zahidan for India on 18th dried fruits . 6 18 mterested in the ex P&lt;&gt;rt of Herr Max Reisch and Herr Tichy lerbert, Austrian subjects fonriTK* Oclober ^ Zahidan for India on the 13th n P 5 S K 1 ^ r ’ Anstr ian subject, a October ^ Zahldan for India 011 the 16th bv E the e LL H n ffari f n hhigineer employed on the im d O?l par ! ment ar . rived at Zabnl n the J3th October to superintend the con struchon of the new bridge at the Nanrab.

Miscellaneous. . O) Residency Hermits.—British sub jects continue to experience considerableL ? 594 F D — 32—9 -1 - 34 —G TPS difficulty with the Police in regard to their registration for ‘ Permits de Sejour There are many British Indians settled among the villages of Khorassan. In such ^^piaces the local police are ignorant of the •equirements of the law and have not informed such persons of the necessity of registering. When they ultimately learn of the conditions and come to Meshed they are lined, and sometimes imprisoned for failing to register earlier. The fines levied appear to bear no rela tion to the offence and no extenuating cir cumstances are admitted. The police require the attendance. of each person at Meshed, and as the permits must, be renewed annually this is a considerable hardship for poor persons, who reside at considerable distances, sometimes 100 miles or more by road, from Meshed. An applicant who applied some months ago was told to come to Meshed. He was ill and unable to travel and was told to come when he was well. He recently arrived and in spite of the fact that he had originally reported to the Police in due time, was fined for late registration. (b) Case of a British subject warned to a Persian woman. —One, Pastalab Khan, British Indian subject, and a resident of Bujd near Birjand recently applied for a permit to leave Persia. He was married 11 years ago to a Persian woman. The exit visa was refused on the grounds that the wife was a Persian. On my instruc tions H. B. M.’s Vice-Consul, Birjand, pro tested to the Governor and explained that the woman was now a British subject by marriage. The husband was then called upon to produce his wife at the Gov- ernorate and she there admitted that she desired to accompany him to India. He was then obliged to produce the parents of the wife and a letter from the local repre sentative of the Governor. Eventually after a further protest by the Vice- Consulate au exit visa was granted. The names of the wife and children appear in the man’s British passport. (c) Export of silver in transit through Persia to India. —Reports are continually being received of the export of bar silver to India, which has passed through Persia in transit. There is some ground for Suspecting that some of these consignments may actually be gold and not silver. It is not clear whether this is legitimate trade in the precious metals, or is a means of transferring sums for other purposes. It is difficult to understand what profit can be derived after incurring the heavy expenses of freight through Persia by this route. {d) Zahidan Customs. —A Persian trader of Zahidan recently purchase^! 32 bags of sugar from a Baluchi who had smuggled them from India. His house was searched but he had taken the precaution of putting the sugar into bags stamped “ Cleared from the Customs ” and no ac tion could be taken against him. A Persian motor driver was detected at Mirjawa in possession of a small quantity of tea, soap and a pair of shoes—total value 6 Tomans. He was arrested but released by the Director of Customs on payment of a fine of 104 Tomans. The power which has apparently been granted to Directors of Customs to arbitrarilv fine in such cases appears to be grossly abused. (c) Bribery case against a British Indian Subject. —The appeal of Harbans Singh, a trader of Zahidan who was sen tenced to 6 months’ imprisonment in a bribery case, has been rejected. It is said he will serve the sentence at Zahidan. H. B. M.’s Vice-Consul is being instructed to^ report on the state of the prison pre mises there, as they are believed to be totally inadequate. C.

This district has been unusually quiet and there is nothing of interest to report during September. There are grounds for believing that operations against Abdul Hussain of Remishk, who continues recal citrant, will be resumed in October from Khwash. Sistan and Kain. 2. At Zahidan a party of the new Cus toms Guards entered our _ Vice-Consulate without informing the Vice-Consul, and searched the premises of a Persian peon. Some sugar was found, the origin of which could not be explained and was presumably received from a smuggler. The peon was forthwith dismissed. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul has protested against the action taken without even the courtesy of informing him. No reply has yet been received from the Governor. The Customs Guards employed in Sistan have proved unsatisfactory. They are locally enlisted and are mostly in league with smugglers. It is believed they will be replaced by regular troops. Persian Officials. 3 . H. E. Djamm, Governor-General in Khorasan, left Meshed on the 14th Septem ber to assume charge as Minister of In terior, at Tehran. Asadi, Mutawalli-Bashi of the Shrine, is acting Governor-General. Musaddaq-i-Diwan, Governor of Bujnurd, has been appointed Assistant to the Gov ernor-General vice Kwajeh Nouri who has been confirmed as Mayor of Meshad. The Chief of the Police in Khorasan who has been here for about seven years is shortly proceeding on leave and is unlikely to return. His Assistant is to act until further orders. Kambool, the Revenue Commissioner at Bakshan in Baluchistan, has been suspended and is charged with embezzlement. Azimi, for some years Customs Ofhcer- in-Charge at Mirjawa, is to be relieved by Muhammad Ibrahim, an Official from Zahidan. The latter specks Persian only, which may be a source of trouble for foreign travellers arriving at the frontier. Daulat Shahi has relieved M. Delissee as Director of Customs at Zahidan. Aghai Isfandyar, appointed Secretary to the Persian Legation, Kabul, left Zahidan on the 13th September. Military. 4 . The mixed Regiment at Bujnurd has been converted into a Cavalry Regiment of 650 sowars. The infantry of this regiment numbering 350 recently arrived in Meshad and formed the nucleus of the new 28th Regiment which has been raised by inclusion of conscripts to a strength of 800. Sarhang Bahman Miza, Chief of Staff, Meshad Brigade, has been transferred to Urumia and relieved by Sarhang Faizareh. Sarhang Itimad A1 Muqqadam has ar rived at Meshad from Tehran to inspect the arms of the Meshad Brigade. Contracts made for military supplies at Birjand have caused a considerable rise in the value of animal rations. A contract has been made for :— Bhoosa 4,000 Kharwars at Rials 50 per kharwar. Barley 2,000 Kharwars at Rials 120 per kharwar. Dry lucerne 2.300 Kharwars at Rials 120 per kharwar. Soviet Affairs. 5. Twenty-seven Turkoman refugees from Russia, twelve of whom arrived in Khorasan 2 years ago, and the remainder during the past year, have been condemned to death by a Military Court for alleged activities on behalf of the G.

The Managar of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Zahidan visited Zabul and took over charge of the Imperial Bank of Persia’s buildings there vacated by the National Bank whose lease had expired. !n view of the probable increase in importance of Zabul in the next few years, it is to be- hoped the Bank will retain these buddings rather than sell at a loss, with a view to possible re-opening of the bank. Upkeep in Sistan is inexpensive. Customs Matters. 12 . It has been learnt from a reliable source • that a firm in Kerman intends to use the Zahidan route for large imports of silver into India. Silver in bars continues to be regularly sent to India, by this route, after having passed through Persia in transit, thus entering India free of all charges except freight. Climatic. 13. A very sharp fall in temperature occurred about the third week in September. Minimum temperature at Meshad falling to 32° F. It has since risen to 60° F. C. K. DALY, Major, C. /.

Persian Baluchistan and Sarhad. 1 . Two sons of Idu Khan and a brother have been permitted to return to Kwash from Tehran. Idu is still under surveil lance there. The Rekis are said to be intriguing against each other and frequently lodge false accusations with the G. 0. C. It appears likely that Sardar Habibullah Khan will shortly be arrested. Sistan and Kain. 2 . Hussain Khan Ghurghuri and Haji Reza, two important Sardars of Sistan left for Tehran to appeal to His Imperial Majesty the Shah against the confiscation of their lands under the new settlement scheme. x\gha Khan, brother of Hussain Ghurghuri sent his family and belongings to Afghanistan and intended to emigrate. He was, however, arrested, but subse quently released, whereupon he fled to Afghanistan. Khorassan. 3. There are vague rumours that His Imperial Majesty the Shah will visit Meshed to perform the opening ceremony of the new Hospital, which is being constructed by the Shrine Authorities. The building is a formidable structure, but would appear to be quite unsuitable for the purpose for which it is intended. Persian Officials. 4. Sartip Abbas Khan, General Officer Commanding in the Sarhad, returned from leave in Tehran early in the month. The Persian Consul-General designate at Delhi left Zahidan for India on the 1 st August. Abbas AH Khan Mishkad, who recently arrived in Zabul as Head of the Registra tion Department, has already been trans ferred. Mahmud Reza Khan, Irrigation Officer in Sistan, has proceeded on leave and the post is vacant. Ali Khan Ruki, an Inspector of the Revenue Department, visited Zabul to enquire into charges of embezzlement. Dr. Hussain Khan Majzada, who was in charge of the Hospital at Zabul for treatment.of opium f-nolosu; J I INDIA FOREiGN D.Uor N&lt; [15JJ 12' 't 1933 addicts, has left, as the Hospital was closed, funds for its continuance not being forthcoming. Sultan Shams-ud-Din Haqi, Chief of Police at Zahidan, left there on the 23rd August owing to ill-health. Agha Sadvi, Chief Judge of Meshed, has been transferred to Tehran and has been replaced by Agha Hairi from Kermanshah. Dr. Saijid Wali-ullah Khan of the Mili tary Service has left Meshed to reorga nise the sanitary arrangements at Kwash. Agha Majlisi has been appointed Governor of Kuchan. Foreign Travellers. 5. Dr. Gabriel, Austrian explorer, has left Meshed on a further expedition into the Lut. E. E. Pardee, American representative of the Firestone Tyre Company, has recently toured in East Perisa. Mdlle. Niyanska, Polish subject, a tourist, arrived at Zahidan early in the month, from India. Frederick Kevedin, French subject, and a Swiss lady, both tourists, motored to India leaving Zahidan on the 3rd August. Mrs. Roosevelt Denis, Belgian subject, and Miss Enid Olnstead, American subject, travelled to India alone by car, via Zahidan, after having been dissuaded from their desire to travel via Afghanistan. Military. 6 . The Persian Officer in charge of the Frontier Guard at Mirjawa recently deserted his post and fled to India. Yawar Saifullah Khan arrived at Zahidan from Tehran early in August. He purchased 1,400 Rupees locally and proceeded to India. It is said that he has instructions to purchase spare parts for the repair of arms. Three lorry loads of arms and ammuni tion recently received from Tehran, were sent to Kwash. Materials are being collected at Birjand for the extension of the barracks. At Meshed the output of all brick kilns has been commandeered by the Military, for construction of barracks.2 Miscellaneous. 7. A British Indian motor driver named l T j jar Singh was proceeding from Mirjawa to Zahidan on the 3rd August. At Khan Muhammad Chah the Road Guards demand ed a supply of drinking water. As he had only a limited supply to complete his journey, he declined to supply any and was promptly beaten. An investigation is tak ing place. Many export certificates issued at Bunder Abbas and sold to traders in Zahidan have been found to have been falsified, by addition of figures. Silver continues to be taken to India in transit through Persia. . August 2nd. —38 bars of silver were despatched from Zahidan by the firm of Shoraka, neither the original consignors nor consignees being known locally. August 6th. —216 Tabriz! maunds of bar silver were despatched by one Khudadad, a Parsi. August 7th. —202 Tabriz! maunds of Turkish silver coins were forwarded by the firm of Ittihadieh. August 13th. —16 cases bar silver (23 Indian maunds) sent by Khudadad. August 8th. —17 cases bar silver (28 Indian maunds) sent by Khudadad. August 20th. —Bar silver weighing 539 Tabriz! maunds sent by Khudadad. The last two items were received at Zahidan through the postal authorities from Bandar Abbas and were declared in transit for India, being consigned to Bombay. It therefore seems evident that this silver must have been landed at Bandar Abbas by steamer, and the route via Persia used to avoid the customs at Indian ports. At Zahidan an influential Indian pilgrim was recently robbed of a box containing 8.000 Rupees. A lorry driver, also an Indian, has confessed to the theft. Health. 8 . No less than 44 deaths from Malaria occurred at Zahidan in one month. Mala ria still continues in a severe form at Sistan. The appeal of local authorities for Doctors to be sent to deal with this epidemic, has remained unanswered, and the only atten tion sufferers can receive is at the Consulate Dispensary. Communications. 9 . The work on the Zahidan-Zabul ro^^ continues and material is being collected to bridge the Sheila and Naurab. It is rumoured that His Imperial Majesty the Shah will again visit Sistan next winter, and if this be true, the work will probably be pushed on. The telegraph line from Meshed via Fariman to the Afghan frontier is being constructed. Afghan Affairs. 10 . The Afghan Consul-General, Meshed, and the Consul at Zabul, were At Home on 11 th August on the occasion of Afghan Independence Day. There are some grounds for suspicion that persons other than Afghans have recently been able to obtain Afghan passports at the ' Afghan Consulates in East Persia. SOVIET. 11 . The Police continue very active in Khorassan in arresting alleged G. P. U. Agents. No less than 48 persons were arrested in August of whom 9 have been sentenced to death by a Military Tribunal. Orbelian, the Armenian Persian Official, mentioned in a previous Diary, appealed against the death sentence, but his appeal has been dismissed. REFUGEES. 12 . Turkoman refugees continue to pour into Khorassan—petty crime is greatly in creasing at Meshed and many deaths are occurring daily among these unfortunate people. The state of those sent to Birjand is reported to be deplorable—they are nearly nude and are paid wageS which are barely sufficient upon which to feed themselves. Some few refugees who had been sent as far south as Zahidan and were practically starving there, tried recently to escape across the border into India, but were ar rested by the Police and are now kept under Indian close surveillance.

PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND THE SARHAD. 1 . Idu Khan is still detained in Tehran. His relatives with difficulty collected 300 Tomans to remit to him. Sartip Abbas Khan, Brigade Commander, left Kwash for Tehran presumably in connection with the case of Idu Khan. Before leaving he re covered 300 rifles from the Gendarmerie who had been enlisted by Idu on instruc tions of his predecessor. Idu’s relations removed to British territory his flocks and camel. In July his house was occupied by troops and his three wives were turned out to live in tents. One died and the others tele graphed a petition tg the Shah, without result. SISTAN AND KAIN. 2 . In the matter of the development of Sistan the Persians appear to have put ‘ the cart before the horse ’ in that no real development is possible until reliable com munications are established. The Zalbul-Zahidan road construction proceeds slowly, but insufficient money is provided and this state of affairs is likely to continue as long as H. I. M. the Shah con tinues to acquire private property in the North, for the Road Funds are mostly re quired for new roads opening up such pro perties. Smuggling continues on a large scale from Afghanistan along the whole length of the Afghan-Sistan and Kain border. KHORASAN. 3 . There have been no developments in the trade situation with Russia, but the trade of the province improved slightly owing mainly to the favourable prices ruling a , abroad for cotton. This enabled mer- ( chants to export stocks via oZahidan and even via the South Persian Railway to gulf ports. The continued immigration of Refugees, details of which are given elsewhere, in this report, is a constant source of anxiety to the authorities, who can obtain no definite orders from Tehran as to how to deal with them. The police continue very active in hunting out all persons suspected of acting as informers to the Russians or as propa gandists. PERSIAN OFFICIALS. 4 . The Governor of Zahidan has been relieved of his post and the Telegraph Mas ter is acting pro tern. Agha Farid, Public Prosecutor, who has been examining the books of the firm of N. A. Mullick, Zahidan, in connection witii a report that he had bribed Persian Officials, has reported that he found nothing incri minating in the accounts. He has pro ceeded to Zabul to examine the accounts of certain Indian traders there. An amus ing sequel to this is that several merchants of Zahidan have received telegraphic advice from Tehran to the effect that Agha Farid has himself now been accused of accepting bribes and that now the Chief Public Pro secutor in Persia is to proceed to Zahidan, to once more check account books. Thus merchants at Zahidan will have had their books checked no less than three times within the last year. M. Delissee, Customs Director at Zahi dan is to be transferred to Muhamerah. He will be relieved by a Persian from Bushire. We may therefore confidently anticipate for 1934 a revival of the customs scandals of 1931-32. Nevertheless M. Delissee's transfer is welcomed by all, as although his integrity was in no way suspect, the fact that he was flung into prison shortly after his arrival at Zahidan, apparently so shook his nerve, that he has ever since interpreted all Customs Regulations in so narrow minded a spirit, that he has given rise to much unnecessary and unwarrantable diffi culty to traders and harmless travellers. Dr. Jawan, Mayor of Meshed, has pro ceeded on leave and it is to be hoped will not return. His place has been tempo rarily filled by Nuri Khan, Assistant to the Governor-General. As the latter was on bad terms with Jawan, it may be anticipat ed that sufficient irregularities will be brought to light, to ensure that Jawan (an irresponsible and crooked youth) will not return.

The price has also fallen. Military. —The Indian firm of N. A. Mullick has contracted to supply Persian troops in the Sarhad, Zahidan and Zabul with rations. The value of the contract is said, to be about 18,000 Tomans per mensem. The firm has received an advance of 12,000 Tomans to erect a flour mill at Kwash. An order has issued to the effect that in future half of the conscripts will be trained at the nearest centre to their homes, while the remainder from the same district will be sent elsewhere for training. The object appears to be to effect economy in trans ferring conscripts, while at the same time ensuring that very large batches from one area shall not remain together. Of the two Regiments by which the Khorasan Brigade is to be increased, one is to be raised at Bujnurd and the other at Meshed. Inconvenience to the public has been caused at Birjand owing to the Military Department having more or less comman deered all supplies of building materials for the construction of new barracks there. Tenders have been called for, for the supply of rations for a strength of 600 horses. It is as yet not clear what motive exists for the increase of Military forces in East Persia. Roads. —The Kwash-Iransheher road has been completed as far as Karvindah and is open to motor traffic. The road from Meshed to Turbat-i-Jam (and incidentally to H. I. M. the Shah's newly acquired pro perty at Fariman) is being metalled. Gendarmerie. —The road-guards at Bir jand have been moved out of the Military barracks into a rented building in the town. The municipal pipe supply of water is limi ted to certain hours and the Amnieh then post guards on all taps, including those in private houses, to ensure that practically all the water flows to their temporary barracks. Customs. —All exports from Birjand, even to other parts of Persia have now to be produced to the Excise Officer and sealed before despatch. The inevitable charges have to be met and ‘Checking Posts ’ have been established on the Zahid an and Meshed roads, where unless a suitable douceur is provided, every sort of difficulty is raised by the petty officials in charge. Justice. Law and Order. —All serious criminal offences in Khorasan are in future to be tried by Military Courts. These in clude Murder, Highway Robbery, Frontier affrays and “ Spying.” Orbelian, a Persian Armenian previously employed in the Revenue Department, and who was arrested on a charge of supplying information to the Russians, has been been sentenced to death. Sallih Kayyat, a Persian Turk has been sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on a similar charge-. The Gendarmerie have had several affrays with smugglers near the Afghan border in which both sides have suffered casualties. House breaking offences have recently greatly increased in Meshed. Turkoman refugees are said to be the offenders. A cold blooded murder recently took place near His Majesty’s Consulate-General as the result of a dispute about a prostitute. The corpse of a soldier was recently found just outside the town. Murder is suspected but the body bears no signs of violence. REFUGEES. 6 . A continuous stream of Russian refu gees arrives at Meshed and the villages near the frontier are said to be full of them. Some 600 families of Turkomans are to be sent to the Nishapur District. Veramin, about 8 farsakhs from Tehran has been suggested as the destination of other Tur koman refugees, but as some 8,500 families are said to be in Khorasan, it is difficult to see where they can be provided with work. Russians in Meshed are reduced to begg ing in the streets. A few have been sent to other towns. Three Russians and one woman with a child, were sent to Zahidan and it is reported that more will follow. No less suitable place can be imagined. The three already there, enquired if they could be sent to Karachi to seek work. On learning that this was out of the question they took up casual work as blacksmiths, but taking advantage of their plight they are not given the normal wages, and eke out an existence bordering on starvation. 15 Turkomans arrived at Birjand. They stated that many more were to follow. They had no instructions and no work, and did not know whether their destination was Birjand or ultimately Sistan. HEALTH. 7. Malaria has greatly increased at Zahi dan and nearly every house is said to con tain a victim to the disease. Dysentry is rife at Meshed.MC 427 FD— 30 — 31 - 8 - 33 —GIPS 3 Malaria which until a few years ago was non-existent in Sistan is now so bad that hundreds of deaths have occurred in the villages. The Frontier Commissary has wired requesting that 4 Doctors, 20 com pounders, and equipment be sent immediate- J y- CLIMATE. 8 . East Persia has suffered during July from a spell of abnormally hot weather. Even as far north as Meshed a high tempera ture accompanied by abnormal humidity has been continual for several weeks. MISCELLANEOUS. 9. Mahtab Singh of Zahidan who was charged with attempted smuggling of silver has been released. Ihe charge was out- * rageous, in that the silver had been sent away from the frontier to a place on the Kerman road tor the purchase of ghee. I he Amnieh witness for the prosecution arranged to produce several witnesses whom he had instructed to state that the man had been arrested outside the town selling Krans to Pathans. T his was a complete fabrication. The court has dismissed the case and ordered the confiscated silver to be refunded. The local Governor has direced that the Amnieh witness be tried perjury, but it is doubtful if this will occur. The open-door into India (there being no land customs, via Zahidan) is becoming increasingly known and exploited. On July 1 st 8 boxes of Turkish silver coin, weighing 10 maunds were sent to Mok-Kundi through the Zahidan firm of Ittihadieh. The silver had been declared at Qasr-i-Shiran by one Muhammad Ismail Nazim as “ In Transit ” for India and is consigned to Muhammad Ali Shirazi of Bombay, original consignor not known. On July 24th a Persian of Zahidan named Soheli exported to India 4 cases of Persian wines, as a trial. On 14th July a Persian woman was detected in the act of stealing goods from the shop of Hafiz Ellahi Baksh of Zahidan. A report was made to a police man on duty nearby. The latter promptly released the woman and beat and abused the complainatft&amp;r A fracas-ensued. The traders were arrested and released on bail. Budh Singh, Indian garage owner of Zahidan had a quarrel with a policeman at Birjand three years ago. He was sum moned to Birjand one year ago, but did not appear. A summons was then publish ed in a newspaper which he likewise ignored. He has been sentenced to three months imprisonment. A party of his compatriots has proceeded to Meshed to appeal on his behalf. Although technically he has poor grounds for defence, a system which allows of an alleged petty offender, being summoned two years after the offence, to attend a court 300 miles distant, can only be described as a travesty of justice. The case has not been brought officially to the notice of any of His Majesty’s Consular Officers. TRAVELLERS. 10 . {a) Foreigners. —Gustav Stratil Sauer, 1 German, who has been exploring in the Lut, and after that paid a visit to Zabul, left Zahidan for Meshed early in July. He tried to obtain a police exit visa for India, but was refused. He called on His Majesty’s Vice- Consul and enquired about visas for India, but did not actually apply for one. At Meshed, he announced everywhere that he had located gold in the Lut. He said he intended to return to Germany. His his tory is such, that one may assume that he intends to £ ' raise the wind ” on the strength of the alleged discovery of gold. Dirk Donald de Yough, Dutch tourist arrived at Zahidan from India on the 12 th July and proceeded to Meshed. (b) British. —Miss Wiggins, Missionary of Zahidan, having been transferred to Africa left for India on the 12 th July. Having neglected to obtain a Persian police exit visa, she was compelled to return to Zahi dan fi:om Mirjawa to obtain it. C. K. DALY, Major C. I.

Soviet Affairs. —The police campaign against suspected G. P. U. Agents con tinues. A Russian woman who arrived with refugees in April was arrested and sent back over the frontier. Two Military Clerks of the Brigade Staff Office were arrested as G. P. U. Agents and it is expected that they will be executed. During the month the police are said to have detected the Headquarters of a G. P. U. organisation at Mesh ad, which lead to the arrest of a number of persons on the frontier, and many Kurds, Jadids, Azerbaijanis and Armenians in Meshad. The total arrests are said to be 103. 3 . Customs. —A new Customs Preventa tive Service is being organised. Eighty-five men are to be conscripted and will wear special uniforms. The command has been given to Sultan Abbas Quli Khan. They will be employed on the Russo-Persian frontier. During June the total receipts of the Bajgiran and Lutfabad customs amounted to Rials 155 only. 4 . Roads. —Twenty-four thousands Tomans have been granted for constructing a road to Fariman, the property recently acquired by H. I. M. The Shah. A tele graph line is also being erected. 5 .

They are from eggs deposited last year. In spite of the fact that areas where eggs had been deposited were mapped last year and the Persian Specialists recommended very early action this year, no such early action has been taken. Tardy efforts to deal with the situation are now being made, but from reports received these locusts have already reached maturity in some places and are depositing eggs. It has not been possible to obtain specimens and the information available at the Governorate General of the province is extremely scanty. C. K.

Other Russians mostly left for Russia about the 17th May. On May 15th, 9 Persians were arrested at Meshad and sent to Tehran on charges of being G, P. U. Agents. The Soviet Consul- General, Solomon Borisoft', proceeded on leave to Russia on the 29th May. The Vice-Consul is temporarily in charge of the Consulate-General. Refugees. —From January 1 st to 18th May 1933 the following refugees are stated to have entered Persia via the frontiers of Khorassan. Turkomans — 1,710 families with 10,200 Sheep. 225 Cows. 205 Camels. I Tactically all the animals have been taken from them by various officials. Russians. 232 persons (Women 53, Men 179). Caucasians. — 126 persons. Persians .— 475 persons. Baluchis.— 49 families with 400 sheep, 25 Camels. Armenians .— 14 persons. Up to 24th May some 80 Russians had been unobtrusively sent back across the frontiers in small parties. Reports from Safar Kaleh indicate that about 50 refugees have been arriving there daily for some time past, and were mostly sent back to Russia, but re turned by other routes and some hundreds are begging in the villages near the frontier. It is learnt from a traveller from Krasna- vodsk that large numbers are proceeding to the Caucasus in search of food and that troops have been mobilized in the Merv- Kushki area. On May 28th a Persian named Mirza Ibrahim of Meshad murdered his Russian wife. On May 31st Naib Rasool Khan, Chief of Police of Sherwan, was arrested on charges of espionage for the Soviet. He has a Russian wife, whose daughter by a previous husband (Russian) is married to a member of the Russian Bank. She is said to be a G. P. U. Agent and is also under arrest. J he local Soviet Consulate-General have been making unsuccessful attempts to secure their release. Communications.—k new road is being constructed from Kuchan to Muhammada^ bad Darajaz over the Koh-i-Allah-Akhbar range to the nearest post on the frontier, to the Soviet Railway. Orders have been received to construct telephonic communi cation between H.

His Britannic Majesty's Consulate General, Meshed, Diary for the month of April 1933. 1. Soviet Affairs. An Armenian named Orbelian, employed in the Revenue Department was recently arrested. He was suspected of being a Soviet Agent. From information obtained from him the Police believe they have discovered an organisation of the Comintern in which Persians, Armenians and some Sikhs are involved. In this connection an Armenian named Sucha has been ordered to leave Persia. Another Armenian, Karakin, has been ordered to live in Tehran. Two Jadids have been sent away but their destination is unknown. Enquiries are proceeding and special detectives have been sent from Tehran for the purpose. A Persian sock-weaver who was seen to enter the Russian Club has been arrested. 2. Refugees. The severe famine in Russia has given rise to an unprecedented influx of refugees. The Soviet have apparently relaxed efforts to stop these destitute people from crossing the border. The problem is becoming increasingly serious for the Persians and it is understood that instructions have recently been received to close the frontier as far as possible against all Russian refugees, and the military posts in the frontier are being still further strengthened. Reports indicate that a considerable number of refugees are being turned back at the frontier. Accurate figures are not available but it is certain that very large numbers of Turkomans are entering Persia. 250/300 families are known to have arrived during April and individual refugees in large numbers. Sixteen Russians and 6 women entered Persia on the 23rd. There have certainly been very many more, but figures cannot be obtained. A large number of Persian subjects resident in Russia have also returned to Persia. A Persian Turk refugee, who recently arrived in Meshed from Askabad, relates a gruesome story. He declares that an Armenian Restaurant Keeper at Askabad murdered 9 persons (presumably persons intending to cross the frontier) in 40 days, and served the flesh of the bodies in the restaurant. He has at last been detected and arrested. Refugees are now being subjected to a very strict examination and only those who are considered to be free of any suspicion of being G. P. U. Agents are brought into Meshed. The fate of suspect ed persons is not known—they are probably kept in local prisons pending instructions. Although actual figures are not forthcom ing, enquiries from many sources lead me to the conclusion that since Christmas, 1932 not less than 3,000 Turkomans and 500/600 Russians must have entered Persia via the Khorassan frontiers. 3. The Famine in Russia. Reports of cannibalism in Russia have been received from widely differing sources. Railway stations are packed with helpless and starving people. It is stated that periodically these are searched and identification documents demanded. The majority are unable to produce such documents and are placed in locked goods waggons and sent out into desert land, being provided with neither food nor water. The corpses are subsequently thrown out into the desert, and others are disposed of by drowning in the Oxus. These reports are so general that, even allowing for exaggeration, they must have a good deal of real foundation. A pood of flour is said to cost 400 Roubles. A certain amount of wheat is being smuggled from Khorassan and sold at high prices. The quantity is insignificant and the Persians are at present not taking steps to stop it, as money is so scarce in the province that it is welcomed from any source. Soviet troops near the frontier, at any rate, and according to some reports elsewhere, are becoming dissatisfied and in many cases are not now issued with ammunition, rioting presumably being feared. At Merv large numbers are said £o be existing only by eating grass. 4. Foreign Consulate. The Soviet Vice-Consulate at Darajaz 1 was closed on the 7th April and the \ Vice-Consul has returned to Russia. The Persian Consulate-General in Tashkent was closed by the Persians recently. ENCLCSURt IN INDIA FOREIGN SEORFUUr'b2 The Soviet Consul-General of Herat visited the Russian Consul-General in Meshed from 23rd to 26th April. Azimi, Persian Consul-General in India, arrived at Meshed on the 20 th en route Tehran. It is said that he will be appointed as Assist ant to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Two Soviet Trade Representatives arrived in Meshed from Russia on the 28th and are staying at the Soviet Consulate General. 5 . H. I. M. The Shah’s Private Estates. The lands and villages of Fariman, situated about 48 miles from Meshed on the Turbat-i-Jam road, have been purchased by H. I. M. The Shah from the heirs of Aim-Ud-Dowleh. The sum paid is said to be 100,000 Tomans, dhe income from these lands has been 32,000 Tomans per annum, when the retail rate of wheat was Tomans 10 per kharwar. The G. O. C. Meshed and the Mutawalli- Bashi (Chief Custodian) of the Shrine proceeded to Fariman recently to take charge of the property on His Majesty’s behalf and erect boundary marks. It is anticipated'that the roads in the vicinity will now be repaired and that His Majesty may be expected shortly to inspect his newly acquired property. 6. Commerce. No trade took place between Ivhorassan and Russia during April. Soviet trading organisations in Meshed have closed their offices. The Soviet Bank transacted no business. Persians who hold 100 Gold Rouble shares in the Russian Bank are offering them for 30 Gold-Roubles, but there are no buyers. The withdrawal of railhead to Kundi from Zahidan has also rendered the export of most of the products of Khorassan unremunerative by that route. The most flourishing export is that of locally made silk loin cloths and handker chiefs. The bulk is not great, and value kifdi in relation to bulk, so that export of this commodity is not very adverseh^ affected by high freight. Silk to m value of 65,000 Tomans was exported to India via Zahidan in April. Most of this is despatched by parcel post to India and nrust throw a considerable strain on the postal system in Baluchistan, being carried over a long and most unremunerative route. 7. Communications. The Tehran-Meshed road was flooded for a distance of 12 miles early in April, between Sabzewar and Abbasabad. The well-known bridge Pul-i-Abrisham was destroyed. All traffic was delayed a.nd subsequently resumed by^ transferring passengers and mails by animal transport across the flooded area. 8. Agriculture. Crops are up to the average, but grain prices are entirely unremunerative. Orders have been received in Khorassan to the effect that Government lands are not to be farmed in future, but to be given in small plots to the peasantry to cultivate. This is the system now being employed in Sistan and is evidently a settled policy. 9. Law and Order. Three highway robbers, who have been operating near Kuchan for some months, have been apprehended.

[ [933 _j ^His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate General, Meshad, Diary for the month of March 1933. 1 . Police. —Sarhang Nawai Chief of the Police in Khorasan, was summoned urgently to Tehran on 9th of March to receive verbal instructions. It is not known in what connection instructions are to be issued, but his visit is likely to be in connec tion with the tense feeling of resentment against the Russians and also latterly against Afghans, which have recently manifested themselves. The police have been active in dealing with persons suspected as being Russian agents and also in causing apparently unnecessary trouble to Afghan subjects. This action has no doubt been taken, at least with the connivance of Headquarters at Tehran, but it is probable that diplomatic protests have caused uneasiness. 2 . Refugees. —Eight Russian refugees who entered Persia via the Lutfabad frontier, have been brought to Meshad under escort. 3 . Birthday of H. I. M. the Shah. —The town was decorated and illuminated on the occasion of the Shah’s birthday. A reception was held to which Foreign Consuls were invited. 4. Military Department. —One hundred and twenty conscripts from the Tabas district arrived at Meshad on 10 th. On March 12 th twenty non-commissioned officers who have been attending the Military school left for Tehran where they will join the Officers’ Training College. 5. Persian Nationality Law. —A number of British subjects in Khorasan who failed to declare their British nationality within the period prescribed by the Nationality Law, aftd members of the considerable Kashmiri community, whose British Na tionality had been forfeited prior to the reciprocal enactment by the Kashmir Darbar, are now endeavouring to resume British Nationality under the temporary concession as regards the time limit, which has recently been made. British subjects may possess one dwelling house and one building for business pur poses. Under the Law they can not normally possess any other immovable property in Persia. A Persian subject who is permitted to renounce Persian Nation ality, must first undertake to dispose of immovable property. The Police are there fore endeavouring to enforce this rule, on the grounds that these persons have become Persian subjects in the meantime. This has caused considerable excitement and resent ment, since the majority of the individuals have long been domiciled in Persia and own their dwelling houses. The Police are strictly within the Law, in the attitude adopted, but it is nevertheless a narrow minded interpretation, for as soon as they resume British Nationality, all these persons will be in a position to once more acquire a dwelling house. 6. Afghan Affairs.—The Police are mak ing difficulties over the issue of Residency permits to Afghan subjects and, in parti cular, are now refusing to recognise Berberis as Afghan subjects. The Berberis are in a continual state of insecurity. Originally under British protection, they have been for some years recognised both by the Afghans and Persians as Afghan subjects— their status is now once more a matter of dispute. C. K.

C. held a reception on the 22nd February to celebrate the ‘ Coup d’Etat’. About one hundred guests were present. Chamber of Commerce. —Much propaganda has been taking place among local merchants to the effect that they should combine with traders of Tehran, Bandar Pahlevi and elsewhere and decline to trade with the Russians until their grievances are redressed. 2. Press. —Very violent owti-British articles have been appearing in the Azadi and Dakar, newspapers of Meshed. Both these papers are subsidized by the Russians 3. Communications. —The roads of Khorasan have been rendered impassable for short periods but for less this winter than is usual. The Meshed-Herat road has been repaired and is in fairly good condition. 4. Russian Trade. —The branch offices of the Soviet Wool and Cotton Trading organisation at Sabzevar and Nishapur have both been closed owing to paucity of busi ness. 5. Removal of the Minister of Court .— In connection with the dismissal of Tey- mourtache, orders have apparently been received in Meshed that reports are to be submitted to Tehran on the activities of all officials known to be adherents of his party, that is to say, who owe their appointments to his influence. Sardar-i-Said, Governor of Nishapur, was summoned to Meshed on the 12th February, and under orders from ( Tehran was to render a detailed report forth with on the state of affairs in Nishapur District. As he was a nominee of Tey- mourtache, this is probably a prelude to his dismissal. The position of Asadi, Administrator of the Shrine of Imam Reza, is also precarious. 1 6. Smuggling is reported to be on the increase at Bolan, Khakistan, Zurabad, and Gifou, all on the Russo-Persian frontier. This frontier area is directly under Military control and it appears that the Military Officers in Command of the posts connive at the illicit trade. Courts of Inquiry, followed by punishment or transfer of the Officers concerned are continually taking place. There is undisguised hostility between the junior civil officials in these places and the all-powerful Military Commanders. The former report to their superiors at Meshed of the irregularities of the Military and the Civil Department forwards the complaints to the G. 0. C., while repeating them to Tehran. The G. 0. C. is thus compelled to ‘ make en quiries ’ and if no actual guilt can be found, it is at least usually expedient to trans fer the Officer. The jealousy between the Departments came to a head some months ago, and an open quarrel between the Gov ernor General and the General Officer Com manding was narrowly averted. There are signs that the truce is likely to be broken soon, and the Governor General is making strenuous efforts to obtain sanction to employ Nazmieh (Police) under his own control to stop smuggling in the frontier villages. 7. Refugees .—Meshed Police have been instructed not to allow white Russian refugees to remain in Meshed in future but to compel them to go elsewhere in Khorasan. Those who have been long in Meshed and have found employment are not being molested. This will no doubt be the cause of much hardship to refugees, who find it difficult enough to obtain employment in Meshed and will in all probability find it impossible in the smaller towns of the province. On the other hand, it is not difficult to understand the nervousness of the Persians, who feel that among the steadily increasing numbers, may be many Com munists who would be a source of unrest in any time of difficulty.

An escort is about to be sent to Tehran to bring a further supply of 1,250 rifles, 5 machine guns and ammunition. The old arms are to be sent to the Baluchistan Brigade. Target practice with the new rifles is regularly taking place. Municipal .—550 poor have been col lected in Meshed and supplied with food, fuel and lighting during the severe weather. The Municipality have funds sufficient to feed 800 until the 20 th March. Chamber of Commerce .—A number of merchants have been elected who are to report regularly the losses they suffer in trading with the Russians. The Tehran Chamber of Commerce has requested the Meshed Chamber to report the prices of Russian goods regu larly. The Soviet firms have supplied the Chamber of Commerce with a price list of articles imported and exported by them, but meanwhile the Chamber of Commerce has received a notification from the Persian Government to the effect that such lists will shortly be supplied by them and should be the basis on which transactions are to take place. Subsequent information is to the effect that the members of the Chamber of Commerce referred to at the beginning, of this paragraph, have been paying secret independent visits to the Russian trading firms and making arrangements to their mutual advantage and detri ment of other merchants whom they were elected to represent. ENCLOSURE IN [ INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S | Let ie r No 32 f\. o • ed &gt; MAR. 1933 - : r MAR. 1933- Roads Department. —Afshar, Head of the Department in East Persia, has been called to Tehran. He is then ex pected to proceed to Sistan and supervise the new road construction there. A Polish Engineer, who is to .proceed to Sistan in connection with the con struction of a dam on the Helmand, has arrived in Meshed. 2 . Miscellaneous. The Russians are subsidizing news papers published in Meshed, and besides cash payments, free gifts of paper, they supply the Moscow Wireless News, which is received at the Consulate General. A wireless operator has recently been employed at the Soviet Consulate General. It is believed their machine is capable of despatching as well as receiving messages. The Russians have expressed regret at the dismissal of Teymourtache, and have been endeavouring to glean from the Governor-General, any news as to the reasons for his dismissal. Owing to the intense propaganda which has been taking place among the Lurs settled in the Zurabad District (near Sarakhs) the G. O. C. decided to remove them from the frontier and they have all (250 families) been brought to Meshed and will later be settled in Bujuurd District. Eight families of Turcomans entered the Bujnurd District recently from Russia. They were pursued for 4 miles into Persia and a woman was killed. A fracas then took place between the Russian frontier guards and Persian Cavalry. The frontier guards have again been increased as a result of this incident. The Persian Government has renamed the Turcoman Country “ Gurgan ”. C. K..

General.--There is little to report, the ctistomary winter period of inactivity having started. 2. Government Departments — Educa tion. —A school for girls has been opened at Nishapur to accommodate 150 pupils. At present the number does not exceed bO. 3. Military. — A further 30 men under a junior officer left for Sarakhs on the 17th instant. The detachment at Bakharz, on the Afghan frontier has also been increased by 30 cavalry. Officers of the Meshed Garrison have been ordered to carry out target practice daily. On 24th twenty * Wakils ’ were sent to Tehran to undergo training at the Officers’ school. 4. Roads. —The road to Herat (as far as the frontier) has recently been repaired. The road from Meshed to Sarakhs has been closed till the 21 st March next, as the Kashaf Rud is impassable. 5. Elections. —The following have been returned as Deputies; Tor Bujnurd—Saabeti. For Kuchan—Fahim-ul-Mulk. 6 . Trade. —On the 19th some 80 merchants assembled to protest against Soviet trading methods. Some violent speeches were delivered and a telegram was despatched to Tehran, complaining that Russian goods due in exchange for Persian goods delivered, were not forthcoming and that owing to the decline in the value of the Chervonetz, in which cash payments are made, merchants suffer increasing loss. The assembled merchants undertook to have no further dealings with the Russians. Having received no reply to their telegram, the merchants approached the Governor-General on the 25th December, and the latter again wired to Tehran on their behalf. 7. Anglo-Persian Oil Company .—On the 23rd Shaik Muhammad Nahawandej who was recently appointed head of the Shariat Court delivered a lecture to the religious students. He protested against the present state of affairs in Persia, and stated that taxation had reduced the population to penury. He further stated that the action of the Government in regard to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company -was injurious to the interests of the country, and had already resulted in the Russians increasing the price of Russian oil and the people bore the loss. He further stated that the Persians were endeavouring to check the spread of Bolshevik principles in Persia, because they were contrary to Islam, but meanwhile the Moscow wireless broadcast co mments on the oil dispute tending to disturb the peaceful relations between Great Britain and Persia, and representing Russia as the only friend of Persia. m On learning of this lecture the police at once arrested Nahawande and sent him to Shahrud, and later arrested five other persons who were alleged to agree with his views. Thereafter the Russians spread a rumour in the town to the effect that Nahawande had been bribed by the British, and had consequently been arrested. On the 25th the police arrested a sock-weaver and a carpet- weaver suspected of being Communists and several other workmen are under suspicion. The authorities in Meshed have received information to the effect that a committee of Afghan Jews and Indians has recently been formed in Herat, working under the auspices of the G. P. U. It has branches elsewhere in Afghanistan and has a press for printing Indian currency notes, which are despatched to India. The Persians believe that the Afghans have not yet discovered the activities of this committee. C. K.

The Tobacco Monopoly Office has notified the public that from March 22 nd, 1933, the tobacco crop will be directly controlled and collected by the Department. National Ran#. —Bahooshi, Assistant Manager of the Meshad Branch, has been dismissed. Military .—Field exercises took place on the 21st to 23rd outside the town. Eighty conscripts of the Nishapur District arrived in Meshad on the 23rd. The G. O. C. has notified the public that action will be taken against all persons in possession of unlicensed arms unless they be surrendered within four months. Unsatisfactory reports have been received by the G. O. C. regarding the activities of the Commandants of garrisons in the Bujnurd District, where the Turkomans are said to have been oppressed and the local Commanders have connived at smuggling to their personal benefit. An enquiry is to be made. Communications .—The Central Govern ment has allocated Tomans 500,000 for the construction of the Kwash-Iransher- Chahbar road and road engineers are said to be on their way from Tehran to supervise construction. 2. Refugees .—Six families of Soviet subjects of Malakan entered Sarakhs area on the 5th November. Two Russian men and two women fled to Persia crossing the frontier near Kuchan. A fight took place on the frontier with Russian guards in which one of the women and two soldiers were killed. The men are alleged to have been political prisoners who had escaped from custody. They are now in custody in Meshad and it is believed a demand for their return to Russia has been made by the Soviet Consul-General. Orders have been received from Tehran that steps be taken to prevent, as far as possible, the entry of further refugees. 3. Soviet Affairs .—At a meeting of the Russian Club on 6 th November, Borisoff, the Soviet Consul-General, delivered a bellicose speech. After declaring the peaceful intentions of Russia, he stated that the Military preparations of the Country were such that should war at any time be foolishly declared against them, the enemy would be utterly crushed. An Official Reception was held at the Soviet Consulate-General on the 7th to celebrate the anniversary of the Revolu tion. On December 1 st the news of the Persian Government having repudiated the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s con cession, reached Meshad. The Soviet Consulate-General induced their adherents to decorate their build ings. They also caused an anti-British article to appear in the newspaper “ Azadi ” which is pro-Soviet organ. At a meeting ostensibly organised by the Meshad Chamber of Commerce (at which the Governor-General and other Officials were present) to celebrate the occasion, )the refreshments which were on an unusually lavish scale for such an occasion, were paid for by the Soviet Consulate-General. 4. Afghan Affairs .—The Military Department has increased the frontier guards on the Bakharz border by 20 mounted men and also at Turbat-i-Jam by the same number, to deal with bands consisting of 5 to 10 mounted men from Afghanistan who have been committing robberies inside Persian territory. Considerable excitement was caused by the approaching arrival in Meshad of Shah Mahmud Khan from Afghanistan. Preparations were made for the reception and a good deal of expense incurred. After waiting for about ten days for further news, it was at length discovered that he had not yet started ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S \ 0 rl] M.2 on his journey. As the roads in Afghanistan are extremely bad at this time of the year, it is supposed that the party will now travel via India and Zahidan or postpone the visit. Numbers of Afghans from Northern Afghanistan elect to travel to Kabul via Herat-Meshad, and India rather than face the difficalties of travel in Afghanistan. They apply for visas at Meshad. There are no means of check ing the bona fides of such travellers, and by arrangement with the Afghan Consul-General, only limited transit visas, specifying route and duration of stay in India are being granted. Appli cants to visit India for trade, etc., are advised by both Consulates to travef via Afghanistan and obtain the re quisite visa from a British Consulate in that country. This does not apply to Afghans domiciled in East Persia, in regard to whom enquiries can be made. 5. Climate .—Winter set in unusually early at Meshad and snow fell and lay from 18th November. C. K.

He is an irresponsible youth considered slightly insane. A special court of Small Causes was opened at Meshad on the 17th to deal exclusively with Municipal Affairs. Gendarmerie .—Mounted Gendarmes succeeded in rounding up four bandits who had been operating in the Kalat District. In the ensuing fight two were killed, and two made good their escape. One Gendarme was killed. A fnrther increase of 50 mounted Gendarmes has been sanctioned for Khorassan. Police .—A Customs Official of Bajgiran who had murdered a soldier was hanged at Meshad on the 30th September. Naib Ahmed Khan Pasbon, Chief of Police of Turshiz has been transferred in the same capacity to Bujnurd. Sultan Shams-ud-Din Haqqi has been sent to Zahidan as Chief of the Police. Census Department .— The Chief Census Officer in Khora^san is to proceed shortly to Zabul to open an Office there and in Persian Baluchistan. Revenue Department .—Information has been received that the rax on lorries and cars is likely to be shortly abolished and a tax levied in lieu on petrol. 2. AJhgan Affairs .—Coronation Day of Nadir Shah was celebrated at the Afghan Consulate General on the 15th October. AH leading officials and Consulate Staffs were invited. The Afghan Minister, Tehran, returned to Meshad from Kabul on the 13th and proceeded to Tehran. It is believed that he has contrived to arrive at a compromise with the local Government in regard to the Herat Bokharz frontier dispute. 3. Trade .—Conditions are extremely bad. Protests have been made to Tehran against the trading methods of the Bussians. A telegraphic reply was received from the Ministry of Commerce to the effect that a Commission was to be appointed to review the matter. Usual Distribution. C. K.

Soviet Affairs .—The 0. C. Lutfabad recently came to Meshad to report that that Russian Frontier Guards had been considerably increased and that these Guards assisted smugglers to enter Persia. Although the Customs Preven tion Service has recently been greatly strengthened on this frontier a further increase of 20 mounted men was sanctioned. The Russians recently obtained a permit to export 20 wagons of wheat from the Dorajaz District. Very strong protests were recently made by the local merchants to Tehran in regard to the Russian trading methods. Fathers of children in the schools at Bajgiran, Muhammadabad, and Dorajaz petitioned for Russian to be taught in the schools. The petition was rejected. The Soviet Consul-General at Meshad recently proposed to the Governor- General that a library be opened for Soviet subjects in Meshad. The proposal met with a cold reception. ( The G. O. C. recently received reports that G. P. U. Agents were very active among the Kurds who have recently been settled by the Persians in the Sarakhs District and as a result four Baluchis accused of spreading Soviet propaganda have been arrested and brought to Meshad. There is much evidence that the Bussians have recently greatly increased their efforts Ho spread Bolshevik principles in Khorassan. On the other hand the authorities appear to be very active and have the situation well in hand. An unsatisfactory result is that reports emanating from private indivi duals and in some cases from G. P. ID Agents passing as “ Informers ” leads to the arrest of innocent persons. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General in Khorassan.

In general locusts hatch out in Khorasan in April-May. In April in warm localities and May in the non-elevated and colder tracts. Locusts hatched out in the Gunabad area about the middle of May and some local officials were despatched there in June. These locusts are described as of the mo- roccan ” variety and some 500 acres of land were affected and it is estimated that 60 per cent, of the insects were destroyed. 8,461 mans of barley flour mixed with poison were used and expenditure incurred amount ed to Rials 4,300 (appropximately £ 43 ) Plans of the affected area have been taken in order that it may be dealt with next year at the hatching season. A considerably larger breeding area, esti mated at 1,400 acres, was located at Turbat- d-Shaikh Jam and Bakharz. These locusts are described by local officials as being of 44 Italian ” variety. 10,800 mans of barley flour, 1,350 mans of manure and 280 mans of poison were used. Again in this area officials were not on the spot sufficiently early to take really effective steps. A map has been prepared and the locust expert has recommended that officials be sent to the area next year not later than April. Saralchs District.—Holers hatched out in mid-May, and officials reached the spot nearly a month later. The locusts were ” Italian.” While the officials were at Sarakhs further swarms arrived from South Russia. 360 acres of land were affected. The Inspecting Officer has recorded that unless co-operation can be effected on the Russian side, satisfactory steps cannot be taken next year. Bajgiran District. —Locusts have appeared here since 1929. Swarms arrived from MC5: 3FD—25—26-9-32—G1PS FOR KHORASAX. 1932. Russia on June 16th. Officials arrived too late to attempt active measures and plans of the area on which eggs had been deposit ed were taken for next year. Russian co-operation is also necessary. Niskapur District. —Locusts appeared here in early June. Eggs were being deposited when officials arrived. The Lo custs were “ Italian.” Plans of the area have been taken and it has been recommend ed that officials be present early in May next. Sabzcvcvr District.—Locusts appeared here, but are described as being of the local variety, which does not damage crops. The Inspecting Officer finally recommend ed to the Persian Government that officials be despatched next year, from Tehran, not later than April and should proceed to the localities which have been mapped. Unfortunately no specimens have been kept and no statistics are available of the extent of damage done. The Khorasan Govemora te have no report of the presence of locusts in August, nor do they appear to have obtained in the past any information as to the direction of flight of matured swarms. From the reports re ceived this year from both Sistan and Kho rasan it appears that a few swarms, which hatch out very early in the deserts of Persian Baluchistan, penetrated as far as the south ern parts of Kain province, but did not as in some former years reach as far north as Khorasan. Such locusts as appeared in Khorasan seem to have orginated in South em Russia and to have migrated south or south-west. 0. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., H. B. M’s Acting Consul General in Khorassan, Meshed (Persia).'CONFIDENTIAL &lt;1 His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate-General, Khorassan, Diary for the month of July 1932. iKi'l 1. Persian Affairs.

It is stated that plans are under consi deration for a Pipe water-supply for Meshed. Various tenders by British firms have been forwarded at the request of the Gov ernor-General. D r&gt;r Justice.—'The accumulation of work in the Courts is So great that the Legal machi nery may almost be regarded as useless. Over 4,000 Criminal cases are pending. Of some 600 prisoners in Jail 300 are reported to be confined without any sentence. Many who are charged with crimes for which the maximum sentence is perhaps six months, have been in Jail for nearly two years, their cases Still unheard. A prisoner who had been in Jail for 20 months while his case was ‘ under investigation recently died. Two days after his death the Court issued the finding ‘ Not Guilty ’. Suits in the ‘ Sulhieh ’ Court are not heard for six or more months. In a number of Small cases British Subjects have pre ferred to forego claims rather than suffer the delay and expense involved in taking the matter to Court. Although stringent orders were recently issued by the Minister of Justice for work to be accelerated it is doubtful if any serious improvement can take place with the existing Judicial staff. 2 .

Sarhang Nawai, Rais-i-Nazmiyeh arrested 3 Kurds in Bajgiran during his recent tour in that area. These indivi duals are suspected G. P. U. agents. The Sarhang assisted the Governor General in his investigations into the conduct of frontier military and Revenue Officials, and they are said to have 7 aid bare a very rotten state of affairs. 154.

Two farashes of the Department Saifullah and Kal Maha- mad were arrested on the 10 th. On the 10 th April, Farshid, Head of the Khorasan Telegraph administration was summoned to the Police Headquarters, where he was subjected to 3 hours cross examination by an expert from Tehran.

P. U. at Askabad. Noban, Assistant to the Provincial Director of Telegraphs was cross examined on 11 th April. -C The Persians are evidently attacking considerable importance to this disco very, which is said to have attracted the attention of the Shah himself.

(d) Edueaticn. —Daudi, acting Director of Education has been dismissed from his post and has been replaced by Tamaddun. 156. (e) Baladiyeh. —It appears that the authorities in Tehran have advised the Meshed Municipality to purchase 2 Ford street watering cars instead of one more expensive car. These Fords will combine the duties of fire engine with their usual functions. Med 2 5 MAY. 1332X, Jdcl 14FD—25—19:5-32—G IPS 2 \ 157.

The Municipal authorities are press- ' ing forward the completing of buildings on the main roads and the repainting of shops, in anticipation of the arrival of Amir Faisal of Iraq. 160. {q) Maliyeh.—ThQ people of Jiris- tan having repeatedly complained against the oppression of the* Maliyeh Department the Governor General went to Bajgiran to make personal enquiries. He seems to have satisfied himself that there was a con siderable proportion of truth in their com plaints and has in consequence suspended several Bevenue officials including Gilani, the Rais-i-Maliyeh of Jiristan, both in Jiristan and Knob an. Further enquiries regarding the conduct both of the Maliyeh and Military officials are to be undertaken by a special commission of investigation under Sarhang Isfandiari who is coming from Tehran. Nasr the Provincial Director of Finances, though not personally being charged with corruption is likely to get into difficulties owing to his lack of administra tive ability. 161. (h) Customs.— h&gt;l. Jacmain, the Bel gian Director of Customs, who had to visit Bajgiran in connection with 'the opening of warehouses on the frontier in connection with the Russian trade had a narrow escape from death. His car ran into a wall and fell over a precipice being finally dashed to pieces. M. Jacmain and his driver luckily fell out when the car first turned over and escaped with a shock and a few bruises. 162. In the course of his visit to Bajgiran the Governor General sent for Naib AH Quli Mirza commanding at Gif an and, after warning him to mend his ways, gave him instructions to deal strictly with smuggled goods and refugees entering Persia and with the smugglers of sheep from Persia into Russia. 163. {i) Opium. —The haul of smuggled opium made by the officials during this fortnight is 4 mans and 18 seers of chouneh ' and 224 miscals of shir opium. 164.

Registration and Customs. — , •Nil. 165. {i) General. —The new Persian 5 and 10 rial notes are now circulating in the Bazaar. 166. The report (mentioned in para- r graph 133) is now denied. Ghazi of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam came to Meshed to deny the report and a representative of the Governor General has been sent to Shaikh Jam to see the old Quran of Shaikh Ahmad Jam. 167. Russian Interests. —Matters affect- in^ the Russians are mentioned in para- •o graphs 153, 154. 168. An agreement has been reached by representatives of the Russian and Persian Governments whereby loaf sugar imported from Russia is to be sold to the Persian Government at 7 Krans per man and moist sugar at 6 Krans per man in Bajgiran. 169. The recent visit of Jam and Sarhang Nawai to Bajgiran appears to have aroused considerable interest among the G. P. U. at Askabad. During the. Turkoman rising of last year the Russians increased their frontier garri sons in order to intercept refugees. In January of this year these garrisons were reduced to their original strength, but they •have again been re-inforced this month. The numbers in the garrisons are said to beJargulan 30 infantry, Gifan 10 cavalry and 20 infantry, Lutfabad 30 caval ry and 40 infantry, Shams Khan 20 cavalry and 20 infantry, Kalta Chinar 15 infantry, Kalat 15 cavalry and 30 infantry, Sarakhs 20 cavalry and 30 infantry. Each post can communicate with its neighbour by wireless. . There are indications that another Turko- t man rising is anticipated. G. g. J.

Our General Officer Commanding is a gentleman of weak character, who is terrified of His Majesty and consequently never visits either Consulate, but yet wishes to stand well with both. For this reason he causes his friendly sentiments to be conveyed from time to time. 109. Enquiries have been instituted as to the proceedings of Naib Ali Quli Mirza, commanding at Gifan, who is suspecting of assisting smugglers, buying Russian merchandise, into Persia. 110. Nine conscripts from the Kuchan district have deserted from the Shahpur Regiment. 111. (b) Amniyeh .— SarhangAkbar Mirza, commanding the Amniyeh, has left for Tehran on transfer. His departure will be no loss to the province. He has been succeeded by Sarhang Saiyid Abu Turab Khan, who arrived in Meshed on 3rd March. 112. Hussain who had been found guilty of robberies on the road leading to Turbat-i-Haidari, has been condemned to death. 113. Incursions into Persian territory by mounted Afghan robbers are still taking place in the Kariz command. Sultan Arsalan Mirza, commanding at Kariz, consequently asked for a reinforce ment of 30 sowars, which has been grant ed. Four Afghans were rounded up by the ' Amniyeh near Bakharz, two were killed and the other two made good their escape into Afghanistan. 114. (c) Kazmiyeh. — Three members of the Meshed Telegraph Office, Masoudi, Davoud Mirza and Shad have been arrested. They are accused of betraying telegrams passing through their hands * to the Russians. Two investigating officers have arrived from Tehran in connection with this affair. 115. The Governor General and the Rais-i-]\ azmiyeh have been ordered to make careful enquiries as to the existence , in Khorasan of branches of an organiza- j tion for the overthrow of the present dynasty, which has been discovered in Tehran. About 160 persons, of whom 32 are military officers, are said to have been arrested throughout Persia on suspicion of complicity in the plot. 116. Sarhang Nawai’s application for a transfer to Tehran has been refused and he has been informed that he is much too good a man to be transferred from the important Khorasan charge. The Sar hang informed His Majesty Consul General that Tabriz and Meshed are second onlJfc to the post of Rais-i-Kul in Tehran, ancT that they have a status superior to all other Police posts in the country. 117. Sarhang Nawai has left for Kuchan 1 and the Russian frontier, ostensibly to enquire into the condition of Turkomans and other refugees who have entered Persia. The real reason is said to be connected with secret activities of thp ‘ Bolsheviks. 118. In paragraph 34 I reported on the strength of a statement of the Rais-i- ; Police that Abdul Hussain Jawadoff had been sentenced to death. This gentle- t man returned to Meshed on 24th Feb ruary. He states that he was tried at Tehran on a charge of being a Bolshevik news agent. He pleaded that he was merely a teacher of the Persian language who numbered Europeans and Americans among his pupils. As no papers were 1 found on him, he was acquitted. 119. (d) Education. —A telegram has been received by the Governor General stating that parents and guardian of Persian students studying, at their own expense, are entitled to obtain foreign currency without the formality of obtaining a certificate from the Education Depart ment. 120.

Typhoid has increased in the Id Gah quarter of Meshed. 125. {g) Malayeh and (h) Customs. — The Governor General left for Kuchan on 30th March personally to conduct investi gations into the complaints of the people against the Revenue Department. «3 126. Merchants and traders have been I somewhat disturbed by reports of several increases in Customs duty during the .month. These appear to have been due to jriations in the rate of the Persian ex change. From the 21st March the old familiar Kran has been called Rial. A rumour that the silver Kran is to be re placed by a paper Rial has caused a certain amount of disquietude. 127. Five Kurds arrested by the garrison of Shamsi Khan (Darajaz) while attempt ing to smuggle 2,500 sheep into Russia have been arrested and sent to Muham- madabad (Darajaz). 128. (?) O'pmm .—Two soldiers and an Amniyeh adopted a novel method of smuggling opium, which they placed on the shoulders of a villager whom they pre tended to be escorting to Meshed as a prisoner. Unfortunately for them the Opium Department saw through the strata gem and the opium was confiscated. The monthly haul of opium is said to be 117 miscals. 129. (j) Communications .—The main roads which were in excellent condition at the beginning of the month have been badly cut up by the March rains and are now in a bad state. Repairs are in progress on the Shirwan- Bujnurd roads. 130. (k) Adliyeh, Registration and Census .—Yet another Court for the Regis tration of marriages and divorces has been opened in Meshed under the presidency of Shaikh Mahomad Ali Ameli. 131. Shahidi Procureur General of the Meshed Adliyeh left for Zahedan, where he seems to have been stirring up the mud in connection with the Customs Department. 132. (1) General .—The interior of the tomb room at the Shrine was swept by three leading Mullahs on 1st March, on which occasion a reception was held. The dust swept out has been retained by persons present as an heirloom in their families. 133. A precious old Quran formerly in Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam on which the all highest is supposed to have cast covetous eyes, is said to have been smuggled to Afghanistan for eventual despatch to England. 134. Asadi left for Tehran on 13th March. He took with him Tomans 30,000 which is a gift from Imam Reza to Shah Reza his namesake. 135. With effect from 1st Farvardin 1311 an increase of 2 Tomans monthly has been ordered in the salaries of all employees drawing less than 42 Tomans. 136. There has been a considerable in- i crease in the price of loaf, sugar and matches. Bad trade, the rise in Customs duty and the practical monopoly by the Russians of most branches of the import and export trade is said to be having a disturbing effect. The Russians have monopolized the export f of wool, cotton and dried fruits and besides having a legal monopoly of the imports of sugar and matches have a practical mono poly of the import of cloth.

The Russians pay Oganoff, Manager i of the “ Palace ” Cinema, 150 Tomans \ monthly for showing Russian propaganda films. As these films have already been passed by the Censor in Tehran, the Meshed Police have no authority to interfere. 139. Three Kurds who were employed by the G. P. U. at Artiq to supply them with reports about Persian establishments in Daragaz have been arrested. These men who are named Jaju, Safdar and Khan Jam are also said to have spread Communist propaganda in Shirwan and Bujnurd. 140. The Bolsheviks are making every J| effort to win over the Persian military I commanders at Sarakhs, Kalat, Lutfabad, W Bajgiran and Gifan. 141. Reference paragraph 74. M.

The peace of winter has continued to prevail in Khorasan, but the weather has been fine so that 6 Tehran bi-weekly mail lorries which had been held # up by snow on the Firoz Kuh pass were able to reach Meshed all on the same day, 14th February. Mr. Fowling of the Anglo-Persion Oil Company, who left Tehran on 27th Jan uary took 13 days to perform the journey which usually takes 2^ days. He was snow-bound at Amiriyah near Firoz Kuh for 5 days and nights and took a further 2 days and nights to cover the short distance between Amiriyah and Semnan. Persian Interests. 51. (a) Military.—The condition of ‘ the Turkoman refugees continues to be unsatisfactory as the Persian subordinate commanders such as Sudan Bayuk Khan and Sultan Musbari on the frontier are said to xurnish G. P. F. agents with information about the movements of the refugees, so that the Bolsheviks are able to terrorise them. Sarhang Traj Khan, however states that in his 'opinion information about the refugees is given to the G. P. U. by certain refugies who are themselves q. p. U. agents. He holds that his sub ordinates are guiltless. As the Sarhang is considered to receive a percentage of his subordinates takings, it is not sur prising that he should whitewash them. '62. The Health Department of the Eastern Army has been abolished and each regiment has to be responsible for its own health arrangements in the future. The decrepit Sarhang Haziq-ud-Dauleh hitherto D. D. M. S. of the Eastern Army has at last been pensioned. 53.

Yawar / bdul Qasim had a particularly olack reputation for bribe taking especially in connection with contraband opium. 54; Sarhang Ali Reza Khan, cotn- mandoi'U&amp;the troops at Bajnurd has been [ i summoned to Meshed .tq answer a charge LeUur 4^4 ,VI. | Dated 24 MAR. 1932 j Receivea 1 4 APR. 1952 of extorting 5,500 tomans from the people of Shir Teppeh, while he was commanding the troops at Sarakhs two years ago. The Sarhang is also in trouble for getting drunk and blinding a Wakil Bashi in Bujnurd recently. 55. Meshed school teachers who were due for conscription have been dis charged by the Education Department. Boys of the 1284 class who have not reported to the military authorities are being rounded up by the Nazmiyeb. 56. Yawar Majid Khan Ghaffari has arrived in Meshed to report on conscrip tion in Khorasan. It is reported that in a recent speech to heads of Departments in Tehran the Shah emphasised the importance of conscription so as to enable Persia to preserve her territorial integrity during the world war which is coming shortly. 57. (c) Nazmiyeh .—The Police have arrested a Persian named Mahmud who came to Meshed from Askhabad via Tabriz on 8th February. He is suspected of being a Communist. 58. An Assyrian named Sarkis, a motor driver, brought a mysterious case from Tehran. The man was arrested and the case was found to contain smuggled cartridges. The matter is under investi gation. 59. (d) Education .—Mustafa Quli Khan Kamaneki has been sent by the Ministry of Education, Tehran to act as an additional teacher of French in the Go vernment Middle School, Danish. There is a shortage of teachers in the Khorasan school owing to the calling up of the younger men for service in the Army. 60. (e) Baladiyeh .—Persons who wish to keep milk cows in Municipal limits have now to get a special license. The washing of clothes in the “ jubes run ning through the city of Meshed has been prohibited. 61. (/) Health .—Small- pox has increas ed in Meshed but otherwise the health of the town has been fairly good. 62. (g) Maliyeh and (h) Customs— ke- tive smuggling business is reported to be in progress at Sarakhs, Lutfabad and Gifan on the Russian frontier. Ali2 Quli Mirza, the Chief Frontier Commis sar is said to be deeply involved. Cows and sheep are smuggled to Riissia and loaf sugar, cigarettes and cloth are brought into Persia in return. The large numbers of Russian cigarettes available in the Meshed Bazaar lends credibility to the report. 63. The smuggling of goods into and out of Persia on the Russian frontier appears to have been particularly lively in spite of the weather, see paragraph 62 above. 84. M. Jacmain, the Provincial Direc tor of Customs, who wished to reach home quickly travelled via Askhabad and Orenburg. The journey to Brussels took him 27 days and cost over £80. The experience has been sufficient to I damp any enthusiasm for using the short route across Russia. 65. {%) Opium .—A Persian officer [ coming from the frontier was frequently bogged during his journey to Meshed. He was seen to be very careful of a load of charcoal he was conveying in his car. Charcoal has been scarce in Meshed. On arrival in Meshed the load of charcoal turned oat to be opium and the young officer had made many tomans by his enterprise. This young gentleman escap ed detection but the Opium Monopoly Department have made their m uai hauls from other individuals. 68. (j) Cammunications. —Afshar, the Head of the Roads Department has been summoned to Tehran to attend the annual meeting of representatives of his department. 67. (k) Adliyeh, Registration and Census .—Branches of the Registration Department are to be opened at Chanaran and Radkan. 68. Aqa Zia-ud-Din Nouri, the Public Prosecutor of the Meshed Appellate Court has been transferred to the High Court at Tehran. 69. (Z) General .—There has been a great scarcity of kerosine oil in Meshed. Persaznaft informed the Governor General that they had ample stocks on the frontier but were unable to bring it to Meshed owing to the state of the roads. The A. P. 0. C. do not keep large stocks in Meshed and so were unable to meet the demand. Excited crowds were to be seen outside all shops selling oil. By arrangement with the Governor General both Persaznaft and the A. P. O. Company arranged to retail small quantities only. In this way it was hoped to avoid profiteering. The A. P. 0. Company Manager informed the Consulate that matters would have been simple if the Governor General had not adopted the practice of granting special recommendations to private individuals for the supply of larger quantities than had been arranged between the Company and the local authorities. Persaznaft have now brought up supplies from the frontier and the A. P. 0. Company have replenished their stocks from Birjand so the difficul ties which had within them the seeds of trouble for the Police, have vanished for the moment. British Interests. 70. Dr. Nasib Singh (paragraph 361 of 1931) the Sikh who is under Police surveillence in Tehran left that city without permission. He was arrested an Sabzawar on 2nd February and was sent back to Tehran under escort. Russian Interests. 71. The difficulties of the Turkoman refugees have been reported in para graph 51 above. 72. Israfil, the brother of GhaniofT|who was supposed formerly to represent the G. P. U. in |Kuchan and is now serving the Bureau Perse in Meshed, has been expelled from Persia by order from Tehran. 73. The following Russian establish ments have offices in Meshed ;— (1) Torgpret under Daniloff. (2) Khlofkom. (3) Russian Bank under Ovchi- nikoff. (4) Bureau Perse under Kousoff. (5) Pers az Naft. It is said that Daniloff, who was recently the Manager of Sharq, will shortly be relieved. 74. Digtarik, who was Secretary to the Russian Consul-General and also acting Consul-General for some time has, it is said, been transferred to the Tehran Embassy. He had a bad reputation among Persian officials. 75. Borisoff, the Russian Consul- j General, who met with a slight accident asked for permission to go to Askhabad for treatment but it was refused.70. Arsen Danalian has been appoint ed representative of the Bureau Perse at Sabzawar in place of Mirza Husain Khan Gahni, a relation of a well known Persian doctor in Meshed, who occasionally attends members of the British Con sulate. Afghan Interests. 77. The Governor General states that the meeting of the Afghan and Persian representatives of the Commission for the distribution of the Helmand water, have come to an end. The matter will now be taken up by the Governments con-l cerned. C. C. J. BARRETT, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan. Distribution: — 1.

It is with great regret that the death at Birjand of Major May Somer ville is recorded. Major J. A. C. May- Somerville, Probyn’s Horse, who was coming to Meshed to relieve Ma jor Ham- ber, Secretary to the Consul-General, was taken ill with pneumonia at Birjand on 21st February. As soon as a telegram was received on 22nd February from the Vice-Consul at Birj and, Dr. Licht- wardt of the American Hospital and Mrs. Narsesian who is a trained nurse were sent to Birjand where they arrived next day. Dr. Lichtwardt remained at Birj and till the arrival of Captain Shepherd, I.M.S., from Sistan, when he returned to Meshed, but the nurse re mained with the patient. A tr'leg an was received on the 25th February from Captain Shepherd giving the news of Major Somerville’s death. The next day Major Hamber left for Birjand with Mr. Dowling of the A. P. O. C. who is proceeding to Nok Kundi on his Company’s business to render all assistance to Mrs. Somerville, who had been accompanying her husband. Major Hamber has not yet returned. 79. The weather during the whole of February has continued most remarkably fine. From the 1st to 24th there was not a drop of rain or a flake of snow. The total precipitation for the month has been only -51'' of rain. • Persian Interests. 80. (a) Military .—The Governor-Gen eral states that it is proposed to reduce the status of the Eastern Army. The independent Accounts and Medical departments have been abolished and it is expected that the General Staff will shortly be abolished also. 81. Sarhang Iraj Khan, commanding the troops gave a dinner to 60 guests, mainly military officers on the 3rd Es- fand (23rd February) the anniversary of the Coup d’Etat.

Yet another meeting of leading officials has been held at the Governor- General’s office to decide on a location for the Turkoman refugees, but no deci sion was reached. ion ?ci- 83. Conscription of the 1286 to 1290 (1908 to 1912) classes has started in Meshed. There have been numerous evasions in the 1284 class and the offend ers are being tried and sentenced to increased period of service in the Army. Conscription has ended at Kuchan, bat will soon be resumed at Tabas. 84. (6) Amniyeh (c) Nazmiyeh .—Several arrests of suspected G. P. U. agents have been made in connection with the Gul Khandun affair reported in para graph 459 of Diary No. 21 of 1931. A special agent named Rasul Khan was sent from Tehran. He has gone to Gul Khandan to make local investigations and arrest those concerned. A man named Rajah suspected of Communist propaganda has been arrested at Shirwan and sent to Meshed. 85. {d) Education (e) Baladiyeh (/) Health .—The Municipal authorities claim that their Health Officer Dr. Iftikhari received 29,679 patients during the first six months of the year and cured them all. 86. {g)Maliyeh (h) Customs.—On the loth the Meshed Customs received in structions to increase Customs duty 40 per cent. A year ago the duty was in creased by 80 per cent. Foreigners who can produce foreign exchange have some relief as the exchanges have been freed and in consequence 100 rupees will now produce 650*60 Krans in place of the previous 473*55 Krans. The lot of the unfortunate Persian paid in Krans, who has to support the increased burdens on necessities such as sugar and tea, has worseifd. 87. A report spread in the Bazar that the import of sugar and matches had been monopolised for the Soviet. The report was supported by statements in the “ Iran ” newspaper. In consequence a representative of this Consulate-Gen eral made’enquiries at the Customs House. Daulat Shahi, the Assistant Customs Officer stated that the report which was2 probably based on certain articles in the unratified Soviet treaty, was incorreot. Anyone possessed of an import license from the Persian Government was still permitted to import sugar and matches. 88. M. Jacmain, Provincial Director of Customs returned to Meshed on 28th February. 89. (i) Opium. —The usual siezure of contraband opium has been made. The amount reported this month is 1191 miscals. 90* (j) Communications .—It is stated that energetic action to impro ve all the roads radiating from Meshed will be taken after 15th April. In the mean time nothing is being done, but the prolonged dry weather has rendered all the mam routes passable. 91. (k) Adliyeh, Registration and Census. —Abdul Hamid Khan Ghiasi is acting as Public Prosecutor vice Zia-ud-Din Khan Noori transferred as Member of the High Court, Tehran. 92. (/) General. —The severe cold of January and early February is reported to have killed 800 sheep in the Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam district. 93. The Russians’ practical monopoly of the wool trade is causing the usual protests from Meshed merchants, who declare there is no profit in it. They have accordingly proposed that a mono poly of the trade should be given to a selected merchant, who will be in a position to meet the Russians on more equal terms. 94. The official rate of exchange hav ing been abolished, the rate for sterling and rupees impro ved. 95. Sartip Abdul Razzaq who has been appointed as a Persian representative for the demarcation of the boundary between British and Persian Baluchistan was the guest of the Governor-General for some days. He left for the south on 26th February. The Governor- General stated that he was a member of the Turco-Persian Boundary Commission of 1914. The Sartip who is very pious and wears a long beard is said to have a good reputation. Russians Interests. 96. There is nothing of importance to record this month. References to Russian matters have been made in paragraphs 84 and 93. Afghan Interests. 97. Sardar Abdul Razzaq, Afghan Consul-General at Meshed paid a fare- weli call on His Majesty’s Consul-General on 21st February and left Meshed for Kabul via Zahedan on 24th February. He stated that he had been granted 3 months leave as he had not seen Kabul for some years, but it was possible that he would not return. The Governor-General told Col. Barrett that Sardar Abdul Razzaq would not return as he was persona non grata and his recall had been asked. He stated that Abdul Razzaq had created trouble when he first arrived first in connection with his arms, and later at Birjand in connection with the license of his motor car, on which occasion he drew a revolver on the agent of Police. Jam says that during the whole of the past year he hns found Sardar Abdul Razzaq quite impossible to work with. Not only has he taken an extreme attitude on the subject of passports and declined to carry out the provisions of the 1921 treaty, but he has magnified every petty frontier matter into a diplomatic inci dent, on which he has written long reports. In fact concluded the Governor General he has been very Afghani. Turkish Affairs. 98. Hakki Bey with his usual consi deration sent to express his regrets at the death of Major May-Somerville. C. C.

Meshed Consular Diary No. 2 for the period ended 31st January 1932. 31. There is little to report for this fortnight as owing to the frequent falls of snow passes have been closed and transport in the plains has become bogged. 3| inches of moisture were pre cipitated during January. The usual peace of winter has descend ed on Khorasan and it is anticipated that this state of affaires will continue till the No Ruz. The Indian mail which arrived on 25th January, was only two days late, but the Tehran mail due on 27th January had not arrived by the end of the month. Persian Interests. 32. (a) Military .—The Turkomans to whom reference was made in paragraph 3 have been selling their horses, but it is said that they have been asking very high prices for badly spavined beasts. Further batches of Turkomans are being | brought to Meshed from the frontier districts. It is reported that they have been victimised by the frontier military officials. 33. (6) Amniyeh .—Khuda Verdi alias Khudao Shah, Yusuf and Wali who had been disturbing the peace in the neigh bourhood of Kuchan have been captured and sent to Meshed for trial by the Military Court. Two other notorious characters, Ghulam Reza and Hasan Khan Topkanlu have also been captured and will be brought to trial. 34. (c) Nazmiyeh .—Two shoemakers suspected of communist propaganda, who had been plying their trade in the Khiaban Ittisal have been arrested in Meshed while Mamao and Shah Verdi, Kurds have been arrested at Muhamad- abad and sent to Meshed under escort. Hasan Ali and Iskandar, Persians, who came from Askabad on the 16th ultimo, were arrested outside the Bolshevik Con sulate on 20th January. It is reported that Ali (paragraph 430 of 1931) and Saiyid Abdul Hussain, Jowadoff, Editor of Raushan (paragraph 184 of 1931) have been respectively sent enced at Tehran to imprisonment for life and to dtjatff. _ 35.

(d) Education. —The Military authorities have demanded a list of pupils exempt from conscription from the Educational authorities. 37. (e) Baladiych. —The Municipality have prohibited the preparation of ice in the town. 38. (/) Health. —The latest health statistics show that there has been a decrease in malaria, grippe and measles, but dysentery has increased slightly. 39. {g) Maliyeh and (h) Customs. —The Customs Department have discovered rifles and ammunition in a case brought by lorry from Tehran to Meshed. It is presumed that they were intended for smuggling into Afghanistan. There is said to be a lively contraband trade in arms and opium between Persia and Afghanistan. 40. ({) Opium. —The officials have- made the customary seizure of contra band opium at Gun&amp;bad. 41. (j) Communications. —Communica tion at this time of the year is extreme ly difficult. It is said that one day there were five lorries bogged between Meshed and Kuchan. 42. (k) Adliyeh, Registration and Cen sus. —The Ministry of Justice have decided that Mullas can be appointed as supervisor “ Qayem ” on behalf of women, minors and the insane, only if selected by the Public Prosecutor. 43. Nine marriage and divorce courts have now been opened in Meshed. Re sidents in the districts have been ordered to notify these courts of all marriages and divorces within 20 days, under pain of a penalty of one to six months imprisonment. 44. (Z) General. —A reception was held at the Shrine on 23rd January in honour of the birthday on Imam Hassan. The Afghan and Turkish Consuls were invited. 45. Nasiri clerk responsible for foreign telegrams has been suspended for com municating a list of telegrams to the Bolshevik Consulate General. 46. The price of Kerosine rose very high in the middle of January, but through the influence of Asadi an arrangement was made with Persaznaftwhereby the price was reduced to a more reasonable figure. O British Interests. 47, His Majesty’s Consul General has been asked to represent to Tehran the great loss that Indian trade is suffering through the withdrawal of rail head to Nok Kundi. Haji Kazim Agha declares that the high cost of transport from Nok Kundi forces Persian merchants to deal with Russia. Russian Interests. 48. The Russians have been acquiring merit by retailing small quantities of oil to the poor, at prices much below the prevailing Bazaar rate. A rumour has been circulated that the prices of al 7 ••goods will be reduced as soon as tho Russo Persian treaty is approved by the Majlis. Afghan Interests. 49. The Police continue to make diffi culties about accepting Afghan passports. During the fortnight under report the registration of nine holders of Afghan passports was refused. Turkish Interests. Nil.

The Consul-General of Hindustan as His Majesty’s Consul-General is called by some Persians held his usual recep tion for British subjects on 1st January. The attendance certainly justified the title, for the United Kingdom colony has shrunk to such a small size that none was present while the Indians mustered close on 50. The Persian officials sent cards. 2. Heavy snow fell on 6th and 7th January. This blocked the passes be tween Kain and Turbat-i-Haidari and between Tin bat and Meshed, so that the Indian mail, which was then 6 days late had still not been delivered on 15th January. The Tehran mail also was delayed 2 days. Persian Interests. 3. (a) Military .—Turkomans who had been loose in Meshed for some time past were rounded up at the beginning of the month and were lodged in the Military Barracks. They were charged with intoxication, whoring, which in cluded knocking at the doors of respect able women and general obstreperousness. The other side of the story is that the Persians had pushed them into Khans, with insufficient maintenance for them selves and nothing for their horses. It is said by the scandal mongers that this was done on purpose so that the Turko mans should be compelled to sell valu able animals to the military officers at much below their real value. 4. 85 newly conscripted Meshedis who had disregarded the summons to go co the Barracks were in consequence, rounded up by the Police. On arrival at the Barrack square the Sergeant Major’s language offended their delicate ears, so they assaulted that depraved person, and were arrested. The result of the Court Martial will probably confirm them in their opinion that the Army is no place for scandalized citizens of holy Meshed. ENCLOSURE IN F0RE, 6N SECRETARY'S ! ' :f,ur . No 25 M ; ’ 'd ? 8 Ft 8 19 : 5 ? : - ^ af® l . 5. Sarhang Kalimi has been appoint ed to the Command of all the troops in the Turkoman Sarai. His headquarters are at Gumbadi-Kubus. 6. The Military department suspects that some of the Lurs who were settled near Buj nurd last year have fallen vic tims to Bolshevik enticements. Fifteen men were arrested but after enquiry two only, Gazanfar and Hako have been considered as G. P. U. spies. They were being sent to Tehran, where, it is thought they will be hanged. 7. Sultan Saiyid Jalal Khan of Kachan (see paragraph 488) is in trouble again. He has now been ordered to hand over command to Sultan Haji Khan and to come to Meshed. As he is one of Sarhang Iraj Khan’s satellites, nothing serious is likely to happen him. 8. The discontent against Sarhang Iraj Khan is coming to a head. Not content with appointing to frontier posts notorious officers like Arsalan Mirza, Buyook Khan and Saiyid Jalal Khan, and taking his percentage of their gains, he is recommending these officers to Tehran for promotion and reward. This is too much for the com- patatively honest, who have started pulling strings at Tehran in the hope of getting Sarhang Iraj Khan removed from his command. Rumours says that Sarhang Mahomed Khan Nakchevan, Iraj Khan’s opposite number in Baluchistan is doing even better than Iraj Khan. The story which sounds like comic opera is that the Officer Commanding troops employs government transport to smuggle goocis from Nok Kundi for the benefit of him self and Arbab Mehdi. Jam, who after all is Governor General of Khorasan and Sistan, is said to have taken the matter up with the Ministry of the Interior. 9. (6) Amniyeh .—The gang of Afghans referred to in paragraph 398 of the Diary for 15th October are again disturbing the Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam district. They have now wounded and robbed the Chief Collector of Revenue at Shahr-i-Nau in the Bakharz area. They got away with Tomans 2,000 in cash and 4 horses.10. (c) Nazmiyeh. —Malakan refugees, who had been settled near Bujnurd have been arrested on a charge of purchasing arms. Three Rjssians who came to Persia to search for work as engineers were arrested after visiting the Russian Consul- General. They are to be put across the frontier at Sarakhs. 11. A man named Rahim who had opened a coffee shop at Bujnuid 4 months ago has been arrested as a G. P. U. spy. 12. The Nazmiyeh have taken security from the Religious preachers of Meshed in order to limit their preaching to reli gious matters during Ramzan. 13. (d) Education. —The Ministry of Public Instruction have granted a credit of Tomans 3,000 for a boarding school in the Turkoman Sarai Sarhang Iraj Khan however wishes to have two schools, one at Pish Kaurai and the other at Maraweh Tappeh where he pro poses to make a large settlement. Por this reason he has pursuaded Adib, the acting Director of Public Instruction to ask for a further credit of Tomans 3,000. 14. Messrs Le Pusliu and Rouanet the two Prench teachers state that as Ramzan has started the schoolboys, some of them fathers, who attend their lec tures sleep openly in class. Their opinion of their pupils is very low and they think that many young men attend the Danish and Razavi schools merely to avoid con scription. 15. Daudi has been confirmed as Director of Awqaf in Khorasan. 16. (e) B'lladiyeh. —The Ministry of Interior has approved what, at first sight, appears to be a strange proposal to ap point an Inspector subordinate to the Municipal Council, but senior to Hadi the Rais-i-Baladiyeh, with full powers to inspect and control the work of that officer. It is suspected that this is some trick played by Asadi to get full control of the Baladiyeh, which has hitherto been a preserve of Hadi and the Governor General. 17. Patemi formerly Governor of Kalat has been appointed Chief de Cabinet of the Meshed Municipality in place of Parahmand wdio has been appointed Governor of Kalat. (/) Health. —Nil. 18. (g) Maliyeh ani (//) Customs. —The system of issuing Fxport Jawazes is shortly to be abolished. These have for nearly a year been valuable docu ments which commanded a high price in the Bazaars. The Castoms Depart ment employes will not welcome the ^ abolition of the system, for at Meshed, Bakharz and Lutfabad they had been making much money by the issue of false certificates to merchants. M. Louis Jacmain was aware of the frauds but had been unable to check them. 19. (f) Opium. —Akhbari, Inspector at Turbat-i-Jam is to be tried for accepting a bribe of a saddle, some tomans and a few mans of tobacco. 29. (j) Communications .—Both the Za tied an and Tehran roads have been blocked by fajls of snow. The Tehran mail was delayed for 2 days and the Zahcdran mail for a week. 21. (k) Adliyek, Registration and Census .—Mir Murtaza Sarabi and Haji Shaikh Muhammad Hasan Pain Khiyabani have been appointed as the priests of the religious courts concerned with marriages and divorces. 22. Two important files are reported to be missing from the Land Registra tion Office. It is suspected that clerks have handed them to interested parties for consideration received. 23. {1) General .—Asadi was held up at Sharifabad for a couple of days. A special lorry was sent out with labourers, who cleared the road for him and he arrived in Meshed on llth Januarv. 24. The picturesquely attired Turko- ' mans mentioned in para. 559 of the diary for the past fortnight, have mostly found themselves in open arrest at the Military Barracks. They are charged with making 1 themselves a nuisance through drunken ness and molestation of women. The Nizmiyeh rounded up 350 beggars on Christmas day and the following days and took them to the Poor House where they will be provided with food and clothing during the next 40 days. The beggar nuisance has, consequently decreased though there are still numbers in the streets. Some of the fraternity pay the attendants at the Poor House, in order to get out, as they make good sums, plying their trade. An American named R. D. Jones passed through Meshed at the latter end of December. He wished to pass i3 through Afghanistan en route for India, but as he had neglected to procure a visa from the Afghan Embassy at £| Tehran the Afghan Consul-General here would not give him a visa. He left for * ‘ Zahedan. # Eight days later another American named Robert Jones, a journalist arrived I in Meshed. He was snow bound here for several days but left for Zahedan on 15th January. It is his intention to visit Kabul via Peshawar. He hopes to procure an interview with King Nadir at Kabul. While in Meshed he lodged first with Aghraf Ali an Indian student from Quetta, who had been studying maohanics at Seattle, Oregon and iater with Dr. Lichtwardt of the American Mission. Robert Jones, who had met Ashraf Ali on the road between Tehran and Meshed hopes to stay with him in Quetta. He appeared to be a very pleasant type of American, who was proud of his Welsh ancestry. 25. The price of carpets has risen in Meshed. This is due to a demand from Vienna and Prague. Shahinian explains that his demand is due to the Austrian and Czech fear of their own currency. It is better to purchase Persian carpets at a loss of 20 per cent, rather than risk the whole of one’s capital in a deprecia tion of the currency such as occurred 10 years ago. The body of Hasan Agha, Mir Panj, father of Sarhang Iraj Khan which had been brought from Berlin, was buried in the Shrine on 31st December. Sarbang Iraj Khan paid 3,500 Tomans, the equivalent of one year’s pay to bring the body to Meshed. British Interests. 26. Ishardas, who keeps a liquor shop, got into trouble again for selling arrack by the dram, contrary to the terms of his license. He appealed to this Consu late-General, but was told that he had better be more careful to keep within the regulations in future. The one Greek for whom this Consulate- General is responsible has also got into trouble again. His offence is usually the same as that of Ishardas. On this occasion, however, he has rented the Deghistani Restaurant, which is rightly suspected by the Police as a gathering place of Caucasian communists. Russian Interests. 27. As is usual a certain number of persons suspected of Bolshevic propa- ganda have been arrested (see paras. 6, 10 and 11 above). The chief matter for discusion has however been the Russo-Persian Trade Agreement. This is intensely unpopular with Persian merchants who complain that it reduces them to the status of brokers and Commission Agents of the Bolshevic Trading Concerns. They are also handicapped as compared with the Russians in the matter of Export Permits. (A T . Z?.—Exports Permits are to be abolished shortly so this cause for complaint is likely to be removed). The main cause for complaint, however is that the benefits which the Russians are to obtain in Persia will be, owing to the Russian Nationalised Trade system, reciprocated only in name. 28. From 1st January the Russian “ Sharq ” firm changed its name to Torgpret. It is now definitely a Govern ment concern. 20. Earnest Veklu, an Austrian born in Russia, arrived in Meshed as represen tative of a German moior car companj 7 and later left for Ashkabad accompanied by a Persian Jew named Yusuf Ismailoff and the representative of Bureau Perse. It is understood that he is arranging for a motor service for the import and export of Russian goods and the Bolshevic post between Meshed and Ashkabad. Afghan Interests. 30. Afghan bad characters have re sumed their activities in the Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam district. These activities may be the cause of a protest at Kabul shortly as the Officer Commanding troops at Khaf has reported that the robbers come across the frontier, commit various crimes and when pursued, escape into Afghanistan where they cannot be pursued. Once they are into Afghan the robbers are safe as the Afghan authorities take no steps either to stop their raids or to punish them. Sardar Abdul Razzaq the Consul- General at Meshed is again a cause for ! complaint. It appears that he has issu ing Afghan passports to large numbers *of frontier bad characters, whose claim to Afghan nationality is extremely doubt ful. These persons considered that the possession of Afghan passport entitle them to increase their criminal activities. Two Afghans named Yusuf and Malnik, who were formerly servants of Saulat-us-Sultaneh, are mentioned as having made themselves particularly obnoxious. Turkish Interests. 4 Nil. C. C. J.

Taghi Khodje Noun, Amir Nuarat, formerly Governor of Baboul has been appointed Deputy Governor- General and took up the appointment on 17th December. He has exchanged calls ■with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General to whom he expressed his great admiration for the British and his desire for the closest of relations. In quite the old style he produced letters from Mr. Chick and cards of invitations to dinners at the Bushire Residency. He is a man of 48 who has spent a consider able portion of his service in Ears and the Gulf area. 541. The newly appointed Russian Consul-General Solomon Lazaravitch Borisofi called on His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General on 28th December, very soon after taking over charge of his appointment from Theodore Degtiarik. He is a fair Jew who has spent a considerable portion of his time in the Department of Trade. He informed His Majesty’s Consul- General that he made a 3 months tour in China in 1928 inspecting Russian trade establishments, and also made a comprehensive tour of Russian trading establishments in Persia in 1931. He and his newly appointed Vice-Consul Boris Tartzeff speak a little English and state that they can read and understand it much better than they speak. It is a fact that an interview with the Russians is now much less of a burden than it was in the regime of Batmanoff and Skaloff. It is even possible to dispense with an interpreter a i the new men are learning Persian as well as English. Batmanoff is said 'to be employed by the Foreign De partment in Moscow and Skaloff by the Department of Trade. Persian Interests. 542. (a) Military .—Recruits born in the years 1284 and 1285, i.e., those of 25 years of age were called up and com menced training on 17th December. 200 were posted to the Infantry and 100 to the Cavalry. A certain number wha failed to obey the summons have ENCLOSURE /n ' 'NOW FOREIGN SECRETAf ’ Fetter / 18 FEB. 193? I Received 7 ^ been threatened with arrest and the prolongation of their service from 2 to 3 years. Boys who took wives in order to escape conscription have been warned that their action is fruitless as the law requires that in order to be exempted a man must have been married for one year. Recruitment started at Bujnurd on 17th December. 543. The Bahrami Regiment held its annual celebration on 17th December. The leading civil and military officers were present at the Bahrami Barracks by invitation. A telegram of congratul ation from the Shah was read by Sarhang Iraj Khan. 544. Sarhang Mukhtari, who came to Meshed from Tehran about 11th Decem ber, is reported to have left for Sistan on the 19th in connection with Perso- Afghan frontier affairs. He appears to have returned to Meshed for the estim able Jam has expressed a hope that he v* ill be able to arrange a meeting between him and His Majesty’s Consul-General. 545. The troops claim toj have captur- / ed 5 bad charactersSountams near inch a C in the Turkoman country. 546. (b) Amniyeh .—The Amniyeh Kuchan have arrested Wali Khan, who had been operating with a gang near Darajaz. They caught 2 of his followers at the same time. 547. (c) Nazamiyeh .—The Nazamiyeh have arrested 2 so-called G. P. U. agents named Gul and Yadullah at Darajaz and Bujnurd. They are being sent to Tehran. 548. {d) Education .—A primary school has been opened at Zaindanlu, a village in Darajaz. 549. (e) Baladiyeh .—The lands of the Khandaq (see paragraph 498) round Meshed city, which are to be put up for sale, have been measured and found to be nearly 300,000 zars. They have been valued by the Maliyeh and Balad A yeh at Tomans 287,000. 550. The Municipality have com menced road repairs which are badly needed. These repairs hitherto have caused a certain amount of botherationwithout any benefit. Their activities have extended to supervision of the Yakchals (places for storing ice). Some attention to the cleanliness of thes places is very desirable. 551. (/) Health. —Djring the 9 months Far Bardin to Azar, 1,725 children were vaccinated by the Municipal doctors. This is a very necessary measure of pre caution, as during the last fortnightly period for which official reports have been received, there were 22 cases of small pox in Khorasan. Other sickness reported includes 33 ce.ses of typhoid, 95 of dysentery, and 850 of “ grippe ”. The weather during the fortnight has been ideal—cold nights with warmjsnnny days. There was a little ; easonable snow on Christmas Day. 552. (y) Maliyeh and (h) Customs .— The scandalous amount of smuggling that is being put through on the frontier appears to have attracted the attention of the Governor General. He suggested in the course of friendly conversation with His Majesty’s Consul-General that it would be a good thing to deport all Sikh lorry drivers, who he considers are a nuisance to all Governments. His Majesty’s Consul-General while not deny ing that some Sikhs as well as Persians and others made profit out of smuggling, replied that many of them met a want and were a benefit to the community. The estimable Jam admitted that he had ^ heard that Arbab Mehdi, a Persian of Zahedan had mede Tomans 300,000 out of smuggling in a few months. He alleged that this present great increase of smuggling was due to the withdrawal of the railway from Duzdap and hoped that Tehran and Delhi would be able to reach some mutually satisfactory arrangement. Jam admitted that the smuggling which is going on to the same extent on the Afghan and Russian fron tiers, renders very doubtful the correct ness of the official figures showing a satisfactory balance of trade. 553. (i) Opium. —Five maunds and 10 seers of contraband opium have been confiscated at Gunabad. Jam claims that his policy of reducing the opium levies has resulted in the stoppage of all illicit opium traffic. 554. (i) Communications. —Satisfactory repairs are being carried out on the Meshed-Tehran road. 555. {k) Adliyeh ? Registration and census. —The Adliyeh have disappointed. It was hoped that in Meshed at any rate the aim of the Persian Courts was the dispensation of pure justice. During this fortnight however the Chief Justice^ enquired of His Majesty’s Consul-Genera® through the Attache, whether he wished the Mota Singh-Gyani Attar Singh case to be decided in favour of Mota Singh. He had received from the Ministry of Justice an instruction that the British. Legation wished the verdict to go in favour of Mota Singh, accompanied by a hint that it would be desirable to settle the case accordingly. His Majesty’s Consul-General very naturally and with perfect truth replied that he merely wished for a decision in accordance with justice, and had no bias in favour of either disputant. 550. Three Marriage Courts have started to function in Meshed, from 23rd December. 557. Haji Ihtasham has arrived in Meshed to take up Census duties. The reported transfer of Kamran (see para graph 507) to Tabriz appears to be in correct as that gentleman is still in Tehran. 558. (1) General. —Asadi’s strong pre dilection for putting off till tomorrow what should be done today, has got him into trouble with the religious students. It appears that the school Fazal Khan has some Waqfs, out of the proceeds of which, Tomans 600 monthly should be paid to the scholars (Tullab) who were transferred to the school Mirza Jaafer. The allowances had not been paid for several months so the Tullab bearded Asadi in his office. On being met by Asadi’s customary “ Chashm, Chashm ’* the Tullab created an uproar, threw the furniture about and had a rough and tre ble with the Shrine Clerks and Farrashes. It is said that Asadi himself received some blows and kicks. The Police were sum moned and the Tullab after being shut up for some time in the water closets, were marched off to the Police Station. The carrying out of grandiose schemes for immence hospitals and new roads, as well as presents to those in high places, render it impossible for the Shrine to find money for the purposes for which the Waqfs they administer were origi nally created. 559. There are numbers of picture- # squely attired Turkomans to be seen wandering about the streets of Meshed. It has not yet been decided where to plant them. To judge by the number of meetings held this problem appears tocause the Civil and Military authorities in Khorasan, much anxious thought. 3 Afghan Interests. British Interests. AiZ. Russian Interests. 562. Smuggling appears to be flourish ing on the Afghan frontier as elsewhere. The relation between the Governor- General and the Afghan Consul-General have not improved. 560. Solomon Lazaravitch Borisofi, the newly appointed Soviet Consul-General accompanied by Degtiarik and Laza renko, Secretaries and Tartzeff the new Vice-Consul, called on His Majesty’s Consul-General on 28th December. The call was returned on 31st December. 561. The arrest of 2 G. P. U. agents is mentioned in paragraph 547 above. Turkish Interests. 563. Haqqi Bey, the Turkish Consul- informs H. M. Consul-General that, protected by a Pahlevi cap he success fully ran the gauntlet of Shiah fanatics and attended Asadi’s reception at the Shrines in honour of Imam Husain’s birthday (see paragraph 553). *7 C.

Sharif Humayun, Governor of Bandar Gaz is said to be a candidate for the post of Assistant Go pernor-General but Jam prefers Musaddiq-i-Diwan, who had formerly acted in the appointment. This gentleman later acted as Persian Consul in Herat and is now unemployed in Tehran. Persian Interests. 518. (a) Military .—Sultan Buyaak Khan, Officer Commanding Troops at Lutiabad has arrested and sent to Meshed 3 Kurds, Hasan, Baba Jan and Gul Muhamed whom he suspects of being Bolshevik agents. 519. (b) Amniyeh .—The Amniyeh have arrested Tahir, who had been committing robberies in the Nishapur neighbourhood for some time past. They have also arrested Abbas Shamkabi a similir black guard whose sphere of action was Sabza- war district. 520. (c) Nazmiyeh .—Dawood said to be a G. P. U. agent has been arrested in Meshed. 521. (d) Education .—It has been ( decided to open two boarding schools for girls and boys in the Turkoman Serai. The proposed expenditure has been included in the Budget for 1311. 522. (e) Baladiyeh .—The Meshed Bala- diyeh is making arrangements for fight ing outbreaks of fire. Presumably they have been stim d to activity by the fire which destroyed JMasirbegoff’s property. 523. The income of the Naishapur Municipalty for the period 1st Farvardin to the end of Aban (21st November 1931) was krans 103,159/15 and the expendi ture was krans 58,043/15. 524. (f) Health .—There were 187 deaths in Meshed during the week ending 21st November, and 115 deaths durij g the week ending 27th November. There were 95 deaths during the period 6th to 12th Azar (28th November to 4th Decem ber). Out of this number pneumonia accounted for 17, small-pox 6 and dysen tery 3. The deaths from “ grippe ” are stated to have been 11. These figures would show that the general health has improved, but it is a fact that the epidemic of colds, cough and fever still continues. (g) Maliyeh and (h) Customs. — Nil. 525. (i) Opium. —About 4 mans of contraband opium have been discovered in Tabas, and a like quantity Jn Bajestan. A fine of 2,865 Krans has been imposed. 526. {]) Communications. —A new section of road is to be made near Miamai. ' The section of the Tehran road between , Aminabad and Saidabad, which are on the Nishapur-Sabzawar section is being repaired. 527. (k) Adliyeh, Registration and Ehteshami who had formerly held the appointment is to be the new h^ad of the Census Department in Khorasan. 528. The registration of the British Consulate property in Meshed has now been completed The Registration Depar ment have charged the higher rate, refusing to accept the excuse that delay in registration was due to the fact that the liability of British Government property had been a subjet of diplomatic correspondence in Tehran. 529. Marriage and divorce Courts will be opened at Meshed and Nishapur from 1st A.ban (21st December). 530. (1) General. —Armenian women in Meshed gave a theatrical performance to the Persian ladies on 1st December. There was a large attendance. The pro ceeds were devoted to the Armenian school. 531. The Governor-General called a meeting of notables on 5th December to consider the beggar problem. 22 persons who were present subscribed Tomans 850 and 27 Kharwars of wheat. Ihe estimable Jam himself subscribed Tomans 100. The Shir-i-Khurshid have given 5,000 Tomans owards the same object. It is reported that the beggars will soon be taken to the DarJ-Tarbiyah for the winter. At present they are a great nuisance to pa-sersby especially wearers of European hats. 532. The Rais-i- A mniyeh is reported to have stated that nearly 600 Turko mans took refuge in Peisian territory during the past fortnight. They were disarmed and taken 100 miles from the frontier. 533. Asadi gave ut the shrine i in ENCLOyURF IN INDIA FOREIGN SE0R r -’ aRY‘&amp; Letter No ^ X1 Dated 4 FEB. 1032 Rer i ‘,a ?2 FEB the usual reception honour of Imam MV* I /f £ j'Husain’s birthday on 13th December. The Afghan and Turkish Consuls were invited. 100 gold “ Panj Hazaris ” were distributed. 534 . The plan for bringing water into Meshed from Deheskh has been com pleted by Afshar, Behzad and Shirazi. It will now be submitted to the Shah. 535. Rasteh, representing the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs who has been appointed to the Heimand Water Enquiry Committee has arrived in Meshed and will leave for Sistan at once. The Governor-General says he has recommended Amir Shaukat ul-Mulk to lead the Persian delegation. Sarhang Murtaza Khan Mokri is to represent the Persian military and Mesbah the Finance Department. Shirazi head of the Khorasan -road department who was also appointed to the delegation by Jam, finds himself unable to move without orders from Tehran. British Interests. Nil. Russian Interests. 536. The Idareh-i-Sharq who were recently burnt out of their house, have moved to Kuchah-i-Bagh Sangi to the house of Aziz-ullah Khan Farrukh. 537. The Governor-General informed His Majesty’s Consul-General that Moulmoun Lazaravitch Burisoff had just been appointed Russian Consul-General in Khorasan. He does not know when he will arrive. The arrest of a G. P. U. agent and d o removal of Turkoman refugees from wiie neighbourhood of the frontier is reported | in paras. 520 and 532 above. Afghan Interests. 538. The appointment of members of the Persian delegation to enquire into the question of the distribution of Heimand water is reported in para. 535 above. The Afghan Consul-General continues to be difficult about granting visas to | travellers to visit Afghanistan. He has •even refused to visa the passport of a British camel driver from Peshin who was anxious to visit Herat. Turkish Interests. 539. It is reported that elaborate pre cautions had been taken to watch every movement of the Turkish Ambassador, in Kabul, who was expected to visit Meshed. Jam was particularly interest- j ed in the proposed visit and made enquiries from His Majesty’s Consul- General about him. Hikmat Bey chang- J ed his mind at the last moment and returned to Kabul from Kandahar. C. C. J.

The father of Colonel Iraj Khan, Officer Coramanding Troop * of the Eas tern Army died in Berlin from compli- •cations following on an intestinal opera tion. On the 21st November a memorial service was held at the shrine, which was attended by all the military officers of the garrison. Colonel Iraj Khan is having his fatherls body brought from Berlin for burial at Meshed and is endeavouring to arrange transport across Bussia to Ashk- abad. 484. On the 23rd November, a day of snowfall followed by intense cold, Ann al Jazairi, Assistant to the Governor- General, died of influenza. He had been suffering from diabetes for years and was in poor health. In him the Russians have lost a valuable assistant. In spite of his Russian leanings bis relations with this Consult-te-General were always cordial. A memorial service for Ann al Jazairi was held in the shrine on 23rd Novem ber. 485. (a) Militai'y .—The troubles in the Bujnurd area have died down, and it is said that the Tehran reinforcements have returned to Headquarters though the extra tioops fiom Meshed are still remaining in the area. 486. Conscription continues in Meshed and appears to be progressing very satis factorily. The high status of the officials personally conducting all enquiries has precluded many of the abuses prevalent in the provinces. As a consequence many sons of the leading Meshed families have been conscripted. A few influential persons have escaped, but this is due to dauceurs bestowed on the proper authorities in Tehran, rather than in Meshed. Persons in Meshed exempted from military service include about 4,700 very poor, 600 sole supporters of their families and over 2,500 religious and secular stu dents. 487. Conscription in Nishapur has ceased for the present, but it has restart ed in Sabzawar. In the provinces the conscription officials appear to wax fat on bribes. Complaints from Turbafc- i-Haidari are particularly pressing and Colonel Iraj Khan has sent 2 officers there to investigate. 488. Saiyid Jala! Khan, commanding the troops in Kuchan is in hot water again. He appears to be either a very tactless oppressor, or a per-on who is so sure of his position that he cares not a rap how many complaints the people make against him. 489. Lt.-Colonel Murtaza Khan Mukri, Frontier Commissar in Seif tan came to Meshed on 19th November on leave. Lieutenant Arsulan Mirza has been appointed Officer Commanding Tioops at Bakhurz. We may now expect a fine crop of complaints of oppression from that area. Ali Quli Mirza Jaban Soozi, brother of the Chief of the Staff has been appointed Commissar of the Bujnurd frontier. 490. A detachment of 20 cavalry has been sent from Meshed to Lutfabad and a detachment of 50 Infant/y has been sent to Kuchan. 491. (6) Anmiyeh .—Sultan Amin Sar- dari, of the Amniyeh is said to have refused a bribe of Tomans 2,000 to re lease Dil Asa, a Taimuri who had mur dered Yar Mohamad 8 months ago. In view of the reported state of the Amniyeh force, this is an event that should be recorded to their credit. The Sultan was going to Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam to pay the Amniyeh, when he chanced upon Dil Asa in the tents of the Kurdani tribe, and arrested him. An attempt was made by the tribesmen to rescue the captive, but it was unsuc cessful, and he is now in prison awaiting trial for several crimes. 492. (c) Nazmiyeh .—The Rais*i-Naz- miyeh has now explained to His Majesty’s Consul-General (see paragraph 448) that there is now no necessity for an applicant for a driving permit to come to Meshed, if he can produce an .English or Indian driving license. If a man possesses no license however, it is necessary for him to come to Meshed from whatever part of the province of Khorasan and Seistan he may be domiciled in, as there is no driving specialist to examine him except in Meshed itself. ,' .2 |gr 498. Sarhang Nawai has no w informed the Consul-General that he is still unable to register British subjects, owing to the non receipt of the forms. The inform ation received by this Consulate that registration had started is incorrect. Foreigners are being registered in Tehran only. 494. Three thieves broke into the H house of Nanak Sinsh on 17th November and stole about 60 Tomans. The thieves have been ; rrested. 495. Sarhang Nawai has indented on Tehran for 10 detectives. 496. (d) Education.—The names of the two French schoolmasters employed in teaching Science in Meshed are M. le Paslier and M. Rouanet. 497. (e) Baladiyeh —The pay of Hadi, Rais-i-Baladiyeh has been increased from Tomans 115 to 145 monthly. It would be quite impossible for this gentleman to live on Tomans 145, even if he so desired. 498. The Meshed town wall is to be demolished and the area occupied by it and the adjoining ditch is to be pit up for sale, for the benefit of the Munici pality. This should bring in a consi derable sum, as the land available though narrow (about 15 zars) is of considerable length. In reply to the Consul-General’s query as to the value of land of such a shape, entirely without water, Jam said he hoped that gardens would be made and houses built. The ditch could be filled up by throwing the eaith of the wall into it. The Revenue and Munici pal departments would collaborate in bringing water to the land. The estimable Jam has a town plan ning scheme which he hopes to com] 1 sfce in 9 years. It appears to be at. excellent plan, which divide Meshed up into 16 areas by broad avenues meeting at right angles. Gardens are to be planted at the points of junction. If the scheme ever materialises the health of Meshed should be considerably improved. 499. (/) Health .—The recent cold weather has much increased the inci dence of “ grippe ” and pneumonia. 187 persons are said to have died from these two maladies during the third week (f November, a period of severe cold. The Attache of this Consulate General was in bed with “ grippe ” for a fortnight. The last days of November showed an increase of temperature and health improved following on a fall of over 4 inches of snow on 23rd November. In consequence the Shrine has not yet organised the reception of beggars into its Turbiyatgah, and the streets seem to be unusually full of these unfortunates. 4b 500. The absence of Asadi at Astrabad and Tehran led as usual to a falling away in the work of the Shrine Departments. Dr. Lichtwardt complained that he could find no official with enough responsibility to authorise the reception into the Leper Asylum of 11 newly arrived lepers, or even to bury a leper who had died. 501. For the province of Khorasan the official report for the week ending 14th November shows 1,012 cases of grippe, 414 of malaria and 62 of pneumonia, 41 of measles and 25 of typhoid. 602. The Health Department is assist ing the Municipality to organise house to house visits by vaccinators, as a pre caution against small-pox. These visits are not welcome to the poorer citizens and the Governor General states that it is necessary to detail Policemen to pro tect the vaccinators from rough hand ling. (g) Maliyeh. —Nil. 503. {h) Customs. —M. Louis Jacmain, Provincial Director of Customs proceed ed on leave to Belgium by the Russian Central Asia route on 18th November. Since the death of his wife last January M. J.'*cmain had practically cut himself off from the small Western European society of Meshed. Daulat Shahi, late Customs Officer at Zabul is to officiate in M. Jacmain’s place during his absence. 504. M. Delisee, the newly appointed Customs Officer at Zahedan, accompani ed by his wife, ca led at this Consulate General on 28th No vember. 505. (i) Opium .—Mirzas Ismail Khan Ashrafi and Abbas Ali Khan, two members of the Monopoly Department, who were suspended as a result of the visit of the Inspection Commission last year have been reinstated. 506. {j) Communications .—The Goklan road between Bujnurd and Astr- abed is undoubtedly a fair weather road made up last year solely for the Shah’s passage. It follows a line which approaches the Russian frontier, solely for military purposes. Asadi followed this road when journeying to Astrabad to attend the recent races in the Turkoman serai. As a consequence he failed to arrive until the racen were over. He informed the Consul-Gen 3ra]* that the road is extremely steep in places. After rain the surface becomes so sticky that it is impossible for a car to proceed even with chains on its wheels. Asadi himself was weather bound in the area between Marawa Teppeh and Gumbad-i- Kabus for 26 hours. It is interesting to note his statement that there is absolute security along the roads in that area. The leading men are according to him, settling down and becoming civiliz ed to the extent of demanding pianos. The poor are however still in a very bad way. He spent a considerable portion of his enforced stop in the house of a poor cultivator, who had no tea or sugar, the felt roof of whose oboo, was full of holes and admitted most or the rain, and whose sole food was partially backed dough. The Turkoman shepherds are less destitude than the small cultiva tors. 507. (Jc) Adliyeh. Registration and Census. —Kamaran, Director of the Sijjil Ahwal Department, has been trans ferred to Tabriz. He was a frequent visitor to this Consulate General until the Shah’s ukase put a stop to social intercourse. 508 The Registration Department has opened an office at Turshiz. It is in charge of Agabi who has been sent from Tehran. 509. (1) Generals—There isafshortage of charcoal in Meshed and the price is from 16 to 18 tomans per Kharwar. 510. The Turkoman refugees who came into Persia over the Lutfabad frontier have been allotted residences in the vicinity of Mtshed. 511. The Governor General has been directed to send samples of all sorts of Khorasan products to Tehran for the exhibition of Persian products. 512. The building in the Khiaban-i- Pahlevi near the British Consulate General, which was recently built by Nasirbegoff, was burnt during the night of 25/26 November. It was a large building the upper floor of which had been recently rented by is said to have been caused by an o\er- heated Russian sto ve, but Sharq are not altogether free from suspicion of having purposely set fire to the building. It is pointed out that they had removed most of their papers the day before. It is extremely lucky that the flames did not extend to the neighbouring buildings. Nasirbegoff is said to have lost Tomans 15,000 owing to the burning of this building. He has been out of luck of late, as he has lost very large sums owing to the fall in the value of sterling.

Nanak Singh promptly petitioned this Consulate for permission to carry arms, a petition which of course could not be supported. The Nazmiyeh are to be congratulated on their promptitude in arresting the burglars and recovering the stolen property. Russian Interests. 514. Theie is nothing of interest to report from Russian territory. In the Persian-Turkoman territory also matters have been quiet. 515.

Asadi the Mutawali Bashi left for Turkoman Serai on 7th November to attend the races. It is understood that from Astrabad he will proceed to Tehran. As is usual, all work in connec tion with the Shrine cased up as soon as Asadi lett. Eleven lepers who arrived at the Leper Settlement were refused maintenance as Asadi was not in Meshed to sign the order. 456. Mirza Reza Khan Mahmudi, Persian Consul at Ch&amp;kansur died at Meshed on 6th November. He had been suffering from small-pox and typhoid. 457. The corpse of the late Editor of the Habl-ul-Matin of Calcutta was brought to Meshed and has been buried in the Shrine. Persian Interests. 458. (a) Military.—The prestige of the Eastern Army has declined very considerably since the departure of General Jahanbani last November. Saxhang Iraj Khan is a “ nice chap^ but he has no personality and he is largely ignored by the Commanders at out stations It is also stated that the taking of bribes by the Headquarters Staff is much more open than before. Yawar Bahman Mirza, Chief of the Staff is the Chief offender and part of his gains are said to find their way into Sarhang Iraj Khan’s pocket. 459. Rottenness at Headquarters is reflected on the frontier, where Com manders are bribed and the Russians show the utmost contemxit for Persian territory. Not only do they pursue Turkoman fugitives aero s the frontier hot foot, but they have organised deliberate raids within Persian limits to kidnap or kill retugees, who are 8 or 10 miles inside the supposed safety line. For instance on 31st October the Russians raided Gulkhandan, where 25 iamilics of Turkoman refugees were residing under Persian guard. The Russians killed some of the Turkomans and took away 5 as prisoners. The Persian guard fired on the Russians and a fight ensued resulting in casualties on both sides. The next G. P. U. agents came to the village kidnapped 2 refuger s and killed 2 others. This incident has been reported to Tehran. The estimable Governor General says that the real fault lies with the frontier Turkomans and Kurds who act as G. P. U. agents. He did not state whether he held the Russians them selves as guiltless. 460. There have been no major deve lopments in the Bujnurd area, where the Persian forces have definitely got the upper hand against the rebels and their supporters for the time being. 461. (b) Amniyeh .—The number of robberies in the Darajaz area has much increased. This is due to the Russian Turkoman troubles. 462. The condition of the Amnieh throughout Khorasan is said to have deteriorated and bribe taking has increased. The deterioration is said to be due to the slackness of Sarbang Akbar Mirza, who commands in the province. Many complaints have been made to Jam. 463. Ali, son of Haji Qambar a noto rious robber, who had been operating in the Hazar Masjid mountains was hanged by order of the Military Court on 5th November. 464. Murders are reported from Shahr-i*Nau, 2 farsakhs from Meshed and from Darajaz. The latter murder was prompted by jealousy, the murderer Zabibullah and the murdered being both suitors for the daughter of Mahomed Hussain. 465. (c) Nazmiyeh -—A quarrel between the Police and Amnieh at Lutfabad resulted in the latter receiving a severe beating. Disciplinary measures have been taken against the Nazmieh res ponsible. 466. (d) Education .—On 1st Novem ber the new buildings of the Razavi school belonging to the Shrine were ceremonially opened. The foreign Con suls were not invited. 467. The Education Department have asked for the services of a second French teacher in addition to M. Ravan see para. 402.2 468 (e) Baladiyeh. —The income of the Meshed Municipality from 1st Far Bardin to 31st Mehr (7 months) was 54,363 Tomans. 469. {/) Health. —Small-pox and dysentry continue to levy a heavy toll in the town. No exact figures for Khora- san have yet been supplied for the period under report. 470. (&lt;/) Maliyeh. —The Financial Court at Tehran has passed a degree against Haji Hussain Agha, see para graph 323. In accordance with this degree 2 gardens and one Caravan Serai at Tehran and 47 villages in Khorasan will remain attached by Government, until a final decree has been passed. (h) Customs. —Nil. 471. (i) Opium. —23 mans of contra band opium have been seized by the De partment. (j) and (&amp;) Communications and Adliyeh. —Nil. 472. {1) General. —The newspaper Cha- man which has not been published lor several years has been re-started by Shams-ul-Maali, who is an employe of the Municipality receiving Tomans 30 monthly. The tone of this paper was formerly moderate. 473. On the 3rd November a meeting of the subscribers to the Meshed Thread Weaving Company was held at the house of Asadi. The Governor-General, the Manager of the National Bank and the leading merchants were present. Asadi, Wahaboff and Kazeruni were elected to the Managing Committee and were di rected to use their utmost endeavours to start work as early as possible with the help of Asadi and the National Bank. It is understood that the merchants have paid l/3rd of the subscriptions they had promised. 474. The Perso-Russian trade treaty has been signed. It is said that both sides agree to consider themselves bound by the other’s Trade Monopoly Policy. 475. The Banks have been notified by Tehran of a further increase in the Kran sterling exchange. The pound sterling is now 67 Krans and 100 rupees are officially equivalent to 520'80 Krans instead of the former rate of 666 Krans. These increases in the official value of the Kran will make more fdifficult the attainment of the savings which this Consulate-General is trying to make. British Interests. 476. Messrs. Arabinda Bose, an Engi neer, and Probodh Chandra Mozamdar, a Dentist, who are natives of Patna and Calcutta respectively, left for Zahedan on 14th November. Their passports had been renewed in New York. 477. Gyani Attar Singh (see paragraph £ 447) in an interview with His Majesty’s- Consul-General declared that Mota Singh’s signature had been found to be genuine. , New quarrels among members of the Sikh Community appear to be coming to a head, Considering their small num bers the Khorasnn Sikhs are a source of considerable profit to the Meshed Bar. Russian Interests. 478. Lazarenko the newly appointed Secretary to the Russian Consulate- General called at thisConsulate on 5th November. 479. On 7th November His Majesty’s Consul General and his staff called officially on the Russian Consulate-Gene ral, on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution. The next day the Consul-General and his Secretary attended by invitation an afternoon function at the Russian Con sulate-General and was introduced to the heads of the various Russian insti tutions in Meshed. The Afghan and Turkish Consuls were also present as well as the usual Persian officials and the Chief Justice, who makes a point of attending all Consular functions. 480. The Russian forces from Turk- manistan have been making themselves very much at home on the Persian frontier during the fortnight. They attached a party of Turkoman refugees at 8 miles within the Persian territory and not only killed and kidnapped Turkomans, but in a fight which ensued killed 6 Persian soldiers. It is under stood that the affair is being discussed between the Persian Government and the Russian Ambassador. The Turkomans, who had crossed the Persian frontier at Lutfabad as refugees were ordered to come to Meshed. They were brought as far as Kuchan by Naib Ghulam Ali Khan, but were then taken back to Muhammadabad under orders from Meshed. Instructions have issued that they should be settled in Darajaz. 481. There is nothing of importance to report from Russian territory. The Bolsheviks continue to have small skir- [ mishes with the Turkomans, in which they are successful. \Afghan Interests. 482. The Afghan Consul-General Sardar Abdul Razzaq is refusing to grant visas to Persian subjects desirous of visiting Afghanistan. He has informed the Persian officials that the Afghan Govern ment do not wish to receive an influx of foreigners, until they have made the laws necessary to deal with them. The Persian Foreign Office have reciprocated by directing their Consuls in Afghanistan to refuse visas to Afghans for as long as the Afghan Consul-General in Meshed declines to give visas to Persians. Sardar Abdul Rozzaq’s action is direct ed against Persians and not against British subjects. Turkish Interests'. Nil. C. C. J.

Jam, Governor General of Khorasan and Sistan, returned to Meshed on 20th October and took orer charge from Asadi the same day. A large number of people went out to Turuq to meet him. His good nature has endeared him to the Meshed populace. 424. Ansari, the Persian Consul at Herat, arrived at Meshed on 27th Octo ber for medical treatment. Persian Interests. 425. (a) Military. —The Finance and Commissariat Section of the Eastern Army has been abolished in accordance with orders from Tehran and each regi ment is now to be responsible for its accounts and its commissariat, 426. Sultan Mahmud Khan, who was educated at Sandhurst, has been apj&gt;oint- ed Commander of the Infantry at Bujnurd. 427. The Shah has approved of the following recommendations for the future preservation of the peace in the Turko man territory :— hostiles have been driven across the frontier and it is doubtful if further sup port from Russian Turkistan will be forthcoming. The Persian operations were assisted by 2 aeroplanes. As the Persian reinforcements have no transport and supply arrangements and were forced to live on the country the strain of supporting nearly 3,000 men must have been very serious on the inhabitants of the Bujnurd area. The Persians have been very success ful in preventing information about events in Bnjnurd leaking out in Meshed city. 429. Conscription for the Army conti nues to absorb the greater part of the time and energy of the leading officials in Meshed from the Gevernor General downwards. The Shah appears to insist that these personages should attend at the Bagh Nadiri in person. (6) Amniyeh. —Nil. 430. (c) Nazmiyeh. —A. G. P. U. agent named Ali en route to Meshed from Askabad was arrested at Kuchan and has been imprisoned in Meshed. The Persian Police were warned by the Persian Consul at Askabad that the man was coming to spy on military move ments in Khorasan. (1) Increase of troops at the front ier posts in the Turkoman country. (2) The stationing of troops in both the Goklan and Yamut terr- tOries. (3) The troops stationed at Bujnurd should be made up from conscripts from all parts of the Khorasan province, and not confined to men from one area. (4) Three lorries should be pur chased for the use of the Bujnurd military command. 428. The mutiny in the Bujnurd area has not yet been quashed though the Persian forces, who have been heavily re-inforced both from Tehran and Meshed have definitely got the upper hand of the combined bands of Turko mans, mutineers and disgruntled Persians who have long been domiciled in Rus sian territory. After a four days battle 431. (d) Education .—The Governor General declares that he has been suc cessful in pursuading the Tehran Govern ment to increase the pay of teachers in the Government Schools. In this con nection see paragraph 401 of Meshed Diary for period ending 15th October. 132. Primary schools have been opened in Tabas, Jawain and Gunabad. 433. A commission consisting &lt; f Sar- hang Hazeq-ud-Douleh, Dr. Hassan Khan Fazal, Dr. Muazed, Dr. Qassim Khan Ghani and Dr. Saiyid Abul Qasim Khan, Director of Public Health, has been appointed to examine medical practitioners who do not possess licences or diplomas. The same gentlemen are also entrusted with the duty of examining dentists and the persons employed in dispensaries. 434. (e) Ealadiyeh .—The Government have approved a credit of Tomans 2.000 for the improvement of streets in Lutf- abad, but work has not yet started. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECR c , A p “S Latter No il 74 Dated 3 DEC 1931 r.u 21 DEC 19312 435. The Meshed Baladiyeh are pre- parii g printed instructions for the clean liness of pilgrim hostels. The Governor- General says that he has received instructions for the completion of the new avenues in Meshed town. 436. (f) Health .—The weather turned very cold during the fortnight and there has been the customary increase in coughs and colds. There is a consider able amount of small pox and dysentry has increased. (gr) Maliyeh. —Nil. 437. (h) Customs. —A large amount of smuggling of sheep from Persia into Russia near Gif an is reported. 15 camel loads of sugar which were being smuggled into Persia in the Dera- jaz frontier have been confiscated by the Customs officer at Kalta Chinar. 438. (i) Opmm.—There appears to be a large import of opium from Afghanis tan. The acting Governor General stated that a great part of this is taken ^ to the Kain district. 439. (j) Communications. —Jam the Governor-General claims that his advocacy in Tehran has led to the Government taking a favourable view of the construction of a metaded road from Lutfabad to Kuchan via, Imam Quli and also repairs of the road from Meshed to Herat. This latter is in very bad repair but His Majesty’s Consul-Gen eral who proceeded along it for 48 miles l as far as Fariman, noticed that attempts at repair had been made in some places. Repairs to the Meshed Za lie dan road have also been approved. (&amp;) Adliyeh. —Nil. 440. {!) General .—The Governor-Gen eral having received the necessary authority from Tehran to expend Tomans 500 it is hoped that the repair of the tomb of Umar Khayyam at Nishapur will soon be taken inf hand. The esteem- able Jam, also hopes to be able to bring water from Dehask 16 miles away to Meshed by a route leading between Kuh Sangi and Shahr-i-Nau. 441. It is reported that 10 agricultural machines have been purchased for Bir- jand, presumably by Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The purchases were made from the Russian Sharq Company. 442. It is creditably reported that the Russian Bank and the Sharq Company have been purchasing rupees at 80 Tomans for Rs. 100. It is said that this money was required for despatch to Zahedan. The Vice-Consul, Zahedan* was informed by wire. 443. The Persian Government have now reserved to themselves the trade i^^ sugar and matches. Ihey will operate' through the National Bank of Persia. 444. The annual races of the Eastern Army were held at Meshed on 30th October. The Consular Corps were invited to attend, but the invitation was issued by the Governor-General instead of the General Officer Commanding as on former occasions. 445. The Russian Bank has been in dulging in a considerable amount of pro paganda against the pound, and trade has been at a standstill. There are no purchasers for pounds. Even the Tur kish Consul has had difficulty in finding purchasers for sterling bills issued by him for Consular purposes. British Interests. 446. The Bazaar rate for the pound sterling has been about 92 but there are no buyers. The result of the British election had no immediate effect. 447. Gyani Attar Singh (sec paragraph 272) left Meshed in company with Ishar Singh on 26th October. His sudden departure is said to be due to the fact that hand writing experts in India have declared that Mota Singh’s signature in acknowledgment of a debt of Rs. 25,000 appearing in Gyani Attar Singh’s books, was a forgery. N . B .—He has now returned to Meshed. 448. The Police Department have dis covered a new means of harassment of owners and drivers of motor cars. They insist that driving licenses must be issued in Meshed alone. On the inter vention of this Consulate General the Rais-i-Nazmiyeh has excused His Britan nic Majesty’s Consul in Sistan from . personal attendance at Mesbed to pass the driving tests, but he insists that the Sistan Consular lorry driver should appear at Meshed in person. 449. Assistant Surgeon Imam-;id-Din of Lahore arrived from Kabul via India and left for Herat on 24th October. Russian Interests, 450. Pogorsky late Soviet Vice-Consul in Meshed returned from Russia in order to escort his wife and family, who had remained at the Consulate General, on his departure to Askabad.1 3 451. There seems to be no doubt that the Russians have got the Turkoman rebellion well in hand. All the embers have not yet been extinguished, but the danger of a really serious conflagration is now at an end. Sjch being the case the Russians have been able to seize the opportunity offered by the mutiny at Bujnurd to annoy the Persians, by arm ing and sending across the frontier various bands of Persian malcontents, mainly refugees after the military rbings of 8 or 9 years ago. These have now been defeated by the Persians and the Soviets having made themselves a nuisance and shown that they are quite prepared to be nasty if they consider it necessary, will probably hold their hands for the present. 452. Russian forces along the Khora- san frontier are now stated to number 100 at Sarakhs, 500 at Kaka, 100 at Lutfabad, 150 at Hoodan, 100 opposite Gifan and 350 in the Turkoman country. These forces are no respecters of the frontier when in pursuit of rebel Turko mans, and one or two incidents of flagrant violation of Persian territory are reported. 453. The Persian have made some further arrests of Kurds suspected of befng Bolshevik spies. They have been sent to Meshed. Afghan Interests. 454. Mirza Mahomed Yakub Khan, Rais-i-Tanzimieh of Mazar-i-Sharif passed through Meshed on 18th October en route to Kabul via India. The Afghan Consul General asked for a diplomatic visa for this high official, but it had to be ex plained to him that diplomatic visas can be granted by His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran alone. C. C.

Confidential .—The mutiny in the Persian forces near Bujnurd is still being hushed up, but the / news has naturally reached the Bazaar. It is given out that the recent activities in that area are due only to trouble •with the Turkomans who have been shewing a natural resentment against the payment of taxes. Troops were sent both from Meshed and Astrabad. The army claims to have got tne upper hand and to have definitely suppressed the unrest. A report has been received that one of the measures adopted was to gam the good will of a leading chief, invite him to dinner and then ambush him while on his way home. This treacherous action aeons to be only too mjch in accord with Presian military methods as the reports fiom Tabriz, in the case for instance of Simko and elsewhere show. 392. On the 6th October Sarhang Iraj Khan returned from his vhit to the Bujnurd area. It is given out, some what ostentatiously, that he went there to inspect the accounts and to increase the frontier posts so as to check smug- f lers and refugees from Russia He imself states that an Amniyeh offi?er, who had been appointed to collect the revenue, quarreled wkh the Turkomans and was killed by them. 1 he Sai hang claims that he has now arrested the elders of the Yamut tribe and has imprisoned them at Bujnurd. 393. Eight thousand young men have been called up from Meshed this year, for military service, but only 834 will be selected. Paragraph 378 requires correction rn this respect. The two Consulate servants referred to therein, have not yet been examined. It is ex-remely improbable that one of these two will be selected for service as he is a decrepit man well over 30. On the 8th October a conscription meeting w &lt;.s held which, in addition to officials and notables was attended by 150 fathers oi prospective recruits. Asadi and Sarhang Iraj Khan and the Editor of the “Pabar” delivered speeches explaining the benefits of military ser vice. The proceedings endea with military music and cheers for the cons cript army. 394. Persian melcontents from Rus sian territory appear to be regarding the Bujnurd troubles as a heaven sent oppor tunity to get a little of their own back. Armed men, many of whom appear to have been fugitive s from Persia after the Mahomed Taqi Khan and Jan Mahomed troubles, have crossed the frontier and engaged Persian troops. Both sides have suffered casualties. 395. 67 students at the School of Vakils having passed their examination were promoted to the rank of VaKil in the Army. 3S6. Night operations were carried out by the garrison on the 11th October, between Khuaja Rabi and the city. 397. (b) Amniyeh .—Sarhang Akbar Mirza the Provincial Commander of the Amniyeh left for Tehran on leave on 11th October. 398. A further raid by Afghan robbers in the vicinity of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam is repotted. They were engaged by the Amniyeh on the 6th October, and the fight lasted all day. Two of the rob bers were killed and one Amniyeh was wounded. 399. {c) Nazmiyeh .—The registration of British subjects has commenced. 400. {d) Education .—Mirza H'.di Khan Ashtari, Director of Education in Kho- rasan, has been appoixited a Revenue Inspector in the Department of Finance. The vacancy has not been filled up. 401. The low scale of pay m the Education Department caused several teacners to take bag.t in the T. legrapn Office.

Ravan a Frenchman has arrived to take up his duties as a \ teacher of physics and mathematics. 403. A new primary school is to be opened at Bnjgiran. 404. (e) Baldiyeh. —The B ddiyeh have decided to rename the principal Khiabans in Meshed. The historical Bala Khia an is now to be called Khiaban Naderi, while Pain Khiaban is to be Khiaban-i-Safavi. The Southern part of the circle round the Shrine is to be Khiaban-i-Ferdausi, while the Northern becomes Khiaban-i-Rezvia. The Khiabans are apparently to be fur nished with name plates. 405. The Municipal Committee is to meet on Wednesdays and Saturdays. On the former day the health doctors are to attend and on the latter day the chiefs of section to give information about public works. 406. Advent of cold weather has put an end to the crowding on the road to Turqubeh. The men nitherto employed in its repairs have been transferred to work on the new Khiaban-i-Tehran, leading from the Shrine at right angles to the Bala and Pain Khiabans (Naderi and Safavi). This new road will un doubtedly be a considerable improv- ment to communication in the town. 407. (f) Health. —The inhabitants of Glfan wired to Meshed asking for a doctor to deal with an outbreak of dysentery and typhus. Small pox and dysentery are prevailing in Meshed city. (g) Malayeh. —Nil.. 1 408. {h) Customs. —The Customs De. partment are now certifying the amount of foreign exchange imported into Persia by travellers. i 409. {i) Opium. —The frustration of several attempts to smuggle opium is | reported. 410. {j) Communications. —Afshar the Provincial head of the Department hos submitted a report to Tehran on the ro wi between Deragaz and Imam Quh (see paragraph 383a). He has asked for a credit of Tomans 10,000 tor the main tenance of this road. 411. {k) Sadri the Chief Justice has returned from Tehran. He appears to have failed in his attempt to induce the Peisian Government to increase the number of Judges in Khorasan. 412. (/) General —Schonberger, Joint Manager of the National Bark of Persia left for Tehran on 30th September and returned on 15th October. His visit was in connection with the exchange situa tion and also the placing of a consider able amount of Bank money in tho project for starting a spinning factory in Meshed. 413. The National Bank have issued a notice that they will accept pounds at 90 Krans up to 20th Mehr (13th Octo- | ber), but will accept no responsibility after that date. 414. The Imperial Bank of Persia are taking steps to retire their old notes, i.e., those issued before 1924. 415. Shahzada Rukn-i-Azam, Gover* nor of Thurshez has been dismissed and Abdul Husain Khan Ardalan has been appointed in his place. 416. Habibullah Khan, son of the lato- Shaukat-ud-Dauleh has been nominated Governor of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. Habibullah Khan has been issued 12 rifles for the defence of the frontier against Afghan raiders. British Interests. 417. Sahib ul Glow Yar Mahomed Bahadur Jung who visited Meshed was invited to the house of Shahzada Afsar, along with several Persian scholars. A discussion about Persian literature was held and Yar Mahomed was recognised as an Adib. 418. A number of car-officers of the Hazara Pioneers are leaving for Quetta to attend a regimental reunion. There has been a little difficulty about their* passports but the local Police have been more helpful than was expected. 419. Mr. Alfred Hodgson a West Au trail an farmer stayed in Meshed for 9 days before leaving on 9th October for Herat en route to Kabul and Peshawar. He states that he is touring to complete his education and hopes eventually to enter the Australian Parliament to fight the iniquitous tariffs which are crushing the Australian farmers and ruining Australia. He writes occasional articles^ for the Sydney Morning Herald..0 GIPD— 596 (C) F&amp;PD— 19 - 11-31 — 25 . Russian Interests. 420. The Turkoman trouble still conti nues but the Bolsheviks have the upper hand, and the number of refugees crossing into Persia shows no sign of diminution. These refugees are now a serious problem for the Persians as many are armed, and there is a suspicion that many of them are Russian agents seek ing to stir up trouble in Persia. The unrest in Bujnurd offers a fertile field for Bolshevik intrigue. One of the Bolshevik aeroplanes engaged in operations against the Turkomans trespassed over Persian territory and caused a protest to be made to the Russian Government. Afghan Interests. 421.

He was beset by a crowd who called him an Armenian called the Turkish Consul an Armenian, and assaulted the Turkish Consulate Farrash, who was in charge of the boy. It was in vain that the farrash proclaimed the religion of himself and his charge or pointed to the star and crescent badge he was wearing. The Police joined in to assist the crowd. Hakki Bey made a strong protest to the Police. Near the Meshed shrine the Pahlavi cap appears to have become a religious badge. 1 have received 3 or 4 complaints from Indian Mussulmans that they have been molested when approaching the Shrine in European head gear, which it is well known that several non-Moslems have entered the shrine, by the simple expedient of putting on a Pahlava hat.

Asadi on taking up the post of acting Governor General at once left his card at th : s Consulate^Generai, The Consul-General and his staff called on Asadi on 19th September and the call was returned in person. Persian Interests. Head of the Soviet Wool Purchasing Agency, 2 other Itussian men and 2 women were travelling by car from Derajaz to Kuchan on the 2lst September by the new road. When near Inchah they were attacked by 5 mounted Kurdish robbers who stripped them of their cloth ing and carried off all their belongings. The Russian Consul-General protested to the Governor General, who declined responsibility on the ground that these persons were travelling on the new road, which had not been declared officially open, and along which Amnieh posts had not yet been posted. 376. {a) Military .—Russian activities across the frontier have led to a large increase in the number of refugees into Persia. On the 15th September 25 armed and mounted Turkomans surrendered them selves to the Persian Officer Commanding at Lutfabad and were disarmed. A further batch of 30 came to Lutfabad on the 17th. In the same manner 60 armed Turkoman refugees have been crossing the frontier near Bujmird, and “large numbers ” are reported to be coming across the Shams Khan frontier. The Governor General assures me that the general policy is to permit Turkomans to enter Persia provided they allow them selves to be disarmed and submit to transportation to some point distant from the frontier. 377. Confidential .—There appears to have been a small mutiny among the garrison stationed in the Bujnurd dis trict. It was caused by an officer’s brutality towards a Wakil Bashi. Re inforcements have been hurried up to Bujnurd from Meshed, but the mutineers have hitherto met with some trifling successes. The utmost secrecy is being maintained by the Military authorities and it is heard that any person guilty of divulging information is liable to summary execu tion. 378. Khorasan is to supply 8,00J recruits to the army this year. The Con sulate employees are more than usually interested this year, as two of their mem bers have received calling up notices. 379.

(c) Nazmiyeh .—The discovery of a Communist plot has been reported which led to the arrest on the night of 18th September of 4d artisans and apprentices all young men. These young men had formed a committee of suroor to help workmen and depressed classes of people. All except four of those arrested were subsequently released. 381. A man named Hassan was arrested on the 17th near the gate of the Russian Coi sula e. He was searched and documents in Turki and Persian were found on him, the contents of which called on his countrymen to shed their blood for the liberty of the workmen and depressed classes of the people, and to check the tyrannies of the rich and the capitalists. This Hassan is a Persian who had come from Russia via Hr-rat, where he had been preaching Bolshevism. 382. A man named George, who claims to be an Aleppine and a French subject has been arrested on suspicion that he is a man wanted by the French Police on a serious charge. {d) Education, (e) Baladiyeh, (/) Health t {g) Maliyeh, (h) Customs .—Nothing to Report. 383.

(/) Communications. —Forth© first 25 miles as far as Imam Quli the road follows the same alignment as the road jfrom Kuchan to Bajgiran. From INDIA FOREIGN SECR ct ^y’S Letter No J 5.8 A. j Dated 5IV0V 1331 j Receivea 23N0V. 19312 this point the road tarns towards the east and reaches Inchaha after two farsakhs (8 miles). This part of the road passes through hills and there is no village on the way. From Inchaha the road assends for one farsakh and reaches Shakarab which is only a spring of water without any village. The distance from Shakarab to Chalmir is 4 farsakhs (16 miles) and the road runs along the foot of the hills with no villages on the way. From Chalmir to Muhammadabad the distance is 4 farsakhs (16 miles). The read passes a point which is at a distance of 1 mile from Naukhandan. There is an Amnieh post at Naukhandan. The road from Imam Quli to Muhammadabad is very bad and dangerous, and is passable by Ford cars only with diffi culty. The portion of the road from Inchaha to Shakarab is specially dan gerous. The road is impassable during the winter season. The road was con structed by the forced labour of the villagers under military supervision. The distance from Muhammadabad to Latfabad is 4 farsakhs (16 miles), and the road is comparatively good. There are 2 -village , on this section. The road which is strictly speaking merely a passage is not yet open to general traffic. 384. (&amp;) Adliyeh .—The Chief Justice left for Tehran on 15th September to press his proposals for a much needed increase in the Bench. 385.

Registration of documents and Census Department. British Interests. Nil. Russian Interests. 387. The Russians have adopted energetic measures against the Turko man insurgents and have definitely got the upper hand. The result is seen in the large number of rebels crossing the Persian border. In addition to the refugees to whom reference has been made in paragraph 376 above 6 Russians who attempted to cross the frontier near Shams Khan were pursued by the Bolsheviks, who killed 2 of them. Al though the Bolsheviks pursued the fugutives 2 miles inside Persian territory, they were unable to apprehened them and the 4 men came to Muhammadabad (Darajaz). The action which the Persians will adopt towards them is still uncertain. 383. Although the Russians ha\e got the upper hand, bands of Turkomans are still maurading near the froniter. The activities of a man named Kara, whose house had beeu plundered by the Russians and whose field of action is Baharzar, Kalateh and Kohneh Kasri are particularly mentioned. His stronghold is in the Ghouzlough hills in Russian territory but he abtains am munition and arms from Persia. 389. Yawar Hussan Khan Daulat Shahi who commands the Persian troops on the frontier appears to have seized the chance offered by disturbances in Russian territory to add to his insuffi cient salary. His method is to hire robbers to act against the Russians and to bring the proceeds of their robberies into Persia for sale. 386. The Census Department has Afghan and Turkish Interests. extended its activities to the Turkoman country. Nothing to report. C. C. J.

Personal. —Mahmoud Jam, Governor General of Khorasan having obtained 40 days’ leave for the object of placing his son in school in Paris, left Meshed on 15th September. When paying his farewell call on the Consul-General he stated that as his son is not strong he is thinking of putting him to school at Lausanne near the Wali- ahad, instead of Paris. The boy who is the grandson of Abbas Quli Khan, late Oriental Secretary at the British Legation, is 17 years of age. 365. The Governor General and the mem bers of the other Consulates who had dined at the British Consulate during the last week of August were on 2nd September invited by Hakki Bey, the Turkish Consul, to what purported to be a tea, but was really a substantial dinner in honour of the victory at Eski Shehr. The Turkish recep tion was attended by the Governor General, the Chief Justice and the Chief of Police only among Persian officials, but the Con sular Corps with the exception of M. Skaloff attended in full strength. M. Skaloff excused himself on the ground of his wife’s illness, but Jam in conversa tion with His Majesty’s Consul-General said that he was being recalled to Moscow and that Degtiarch, the Secretary, was to act in his place. There had been rumours in the town for some time that all was not well between David Skaloff and the G. P. U. who are represented by Degtiarch. Mme Skaloff is said to have made indiscreet references to the G. P. U. in the Russian Club. On 13th September Skaloff paid a p. p. c. call on this Consulate. He stated that owing to his wife's illness he had applied for and had been granted one month’s leave, and that after handing over to Deg tiarch, who would act until the arrival of a permanent successor he would leave Meshed on 16th September. He hoped to remain in Moscow, but thought that was unlikely and added that rumour assigned him among other posts to the Consulate General at Constantinople. Skaloff is a Bolshevik Jew, but taking him all in all he was not a bad sort of Russian Consul-GeneralJo^ha^sjiL Meshed, and he ENCLOSURE lN ^ .

Persian Interests, (a) Military .— Sultan Mirza AU KJian is emplgyed on conscription duty at Turbat-i-Haidari. 367.

An atrocious murder is reported from Yusufabad near Chinaran. A man assisted by his second wife and his brothers took his senior wife to a garden and there hanged her. 369. (o) Nazmiyeh. —The registration of foreigners has not been taken up yet. Sardari, the head of the Criminal Investiga tion Department has been recalled to Tehran, as he was on too intimate terms with the Bolsheviks. 370. (d) Baldiyeh. —The new Khiaban- i-Tehran has been opened. The Baldiyeh have decided to pay compensation for houses demolished at the rate fixed by the owner when registering the house with the Sabat- i-Asnad. 371.

British Interests. —Lady Karimbhoy Ibrahim, wife of the Bombay mill owner, arrived in Meshed on pilgrimage on 3rd September. 373. Russian Interests. —There are no striking developments in the Turkoman Kirghiz situation. The Russians are taking stern measures to deal with sedition and espionage at Ashkabad and on the frontier, but they have not yet got the situation well in hand, though the mail service on the Orenburg railway seems to be running with fair regularity. A combat at Kazanjik near Kizil Arvat is reported.2 The clemency shown by the Russians the occasion of the Waliahad’s arrival e''? towards their Persian political prisoners on Baku is much appreciated. &lt; - 0.

The Rais-i-Nazmiyeh’s suspicions regarding Sikh visits to the Russians are mentioned in paragraph 315 above.

The Russians appear to be having difficulty in obtaining transport from the frontier to Ashkabad for the cotton which they rushed out of Persia in July. It is lying at their Customs post of Gaudan. Phillipe Chichmanian of the Garage-i-Ian is said to have accepted the contract for the transport of cotton from Gaudan to Ashkabad. The same man carries the Russian courier to Ashkabad. 334. The Sharq Company have arranged .with Persian traders for a weekly meeting at their office to exchange views about Russo-Persian trade.

Afghan interests. —A report has been received in Meshed that the Afghans have withdrawn the garrisons of all posts on the Persian frontier. This report has naturally given rise to rumours of troubles in the interior of Afghanistan. • 336- The Russians have imported much sugar into Afghanistan and in exchange have taken large quantities of cotton and wool. • ^ 337. A small Afghan robber attack in Persian limits has been mentioned in para graph 311 above. 338.

(a) Military. —Sultan Mirza Ali Khan has been appointed to command the detachment of troops at Turbat-i* Haidari. He is also in charge of conscrip tion in that area. He was recently success ful in capturing certain robbers who had been disturbing the peace near Tabas. 342. The Artillery men who had been spending the hot weather at Turuqbeh re turned to Meshed on 23rd August. 343. A number of the inhabitants of Kuchan have taken bast in the Telegraph office as a protest against the tyranny of Sultan Saiyid Jalal Khan. This officer was particularly kind to Mr. Bellville and Mrs. Montagu when they were forced to spend 4 days in Kuchan owing to aeroplane trouble. Kuchan is unfortunate in its military com manders. Two years back the tyranny of Naib Arsalan Mirza, a close relation of the Am’r Lashkar, created a scandal, but the villain of the piece was whitewashed. It is not known whether Saiyid Jalal's rela tions are sufficiently influential to bring about the same results. The Governor General has ordered the people to evacuate the Telegraph Office before their complaints are heard. Saiyid JalaFs agent in Bajgiran is Vakil Saiyid Habib, who appears to have been out Heroding Herod to such an extent that some villagers have taken refuge in Rus sian territory in spite of the unrest there. Gul Mahomad, son of Taimur, has laid the Bajgiran complaints against the Vakil before Sarhang Iraj Khan. 344. Bolshevik propaganda among re cruits at Bajgiran is reported, and the Per sians have to exercise discrimination in recruiting. Three Bolshevik agents accus ed of spreading communist ideas in that area have been arrested and sent to Meshed. 345. Yavar Bahman Mirza, Chief of the Staff, left Meshed to inspect posts at Lutfa- bad and Naukhandan.

The Price Commission has raised the price of bread in Meshed by 4 shahis a man to one kran eight shahis. The Income of the Meshed Municipality for the first 4 months of the year was 230, 4G3 krans. The plan for the new town planning scheme of Sabzawar has been submitted to the Governor General's approval. 354. (/) Health. —Small-pox is increasing in Meshed.

Two Inspectors of the Mono poly Department have been dismissed for breaches of Departmental regulations. The representative of the Finance De partment at Lutfabad has ordered the closing of all the opium dens (Shireh Khaneh) in that place. This appears to be a method of obtaining a few krans from each opium smokers and so increasing the Madakhil of the post. A murder in connection with a petty quarrel concerning 4 miscal of opium is re ported from Sabzawar. 358. (j) Ad%eA.~Sadari, the Chief Jus tice of Khorasan, has left for Turbat-r- Haidari and Turshiz to inspect the Courts there. 359.

Twenty-six Malakan families and 42 Turkoman refugees from Russia have been settled by the Persian Government at Kuli Dayh in the Goklan Turkoman country. 361. British Interests. —The Police have not yet commenced the registration of British subjects in Khorasan but travellers recently arr ved from the frontier have sometimes had their holding of money entered in their passports. The sudden orders of the Iraq Govern ment asking that visas should not be granted to pilgrims desirous of visiting Iraq has caused some hardship to Indian pilgr ms in Khorasan. They are unable to understand why the outbreak of cholera in Basrah should prevent them from visting the holy places, which are distant from that port. They point out that it is for Persia to impose quarantine against Iraq and not for Iraq to take measures against visitors Irom Persia. Orders to that effect having been received however visas have been refused to all pilgrims though residents of Iraq have been permitted to return home.MC 537 FD— 35 — 21 - 9 - 31 —G IPS Nasib Singh (paragraph 300) came to Meshed in his motor car on 28th August. He appears to have evaded police super vision, but was arrested on his arrival here. He was released soon after and ^prdered to return to Tehran. Indian traders are in a happy mood as import permits have been coming in freely and so, in the absence of competition, profits have been extremely satisfactory. 362. Russian hiterests .—The rebellion in Turkestan still continues with tales of the ^0 burning of Russian lorries and obviously \ ^Exaggerated stories of huge slaughter of Russians and petty casualties among the Turkomans. The demand for rifles has increased and the price along the border is 1,500 Roubles corresponding to 75 Tomans. The border Kurds are said to be particularly interested in this Arms Trade. The des truction of railway stores at Kizil Arvat, apparently as a result of sabotage is re ported. Russian reinforcements from Tashkent have passed through Ashkabad bound for Krasnavodask. Ashkabad itself is reported to be denuded of troops and even of Police to such an extent that women are policing the streets. Turkoman refugees continue to cross the border seeking refuge in Persia, and the Russians naturally take advantage of this method of getting G. P. U. agents across the frontier. Another supposed spy has been arrested during the past fort night and brought to Meshed. Russian propaganda among recruits for the Persian army still continues, but the Bolsheviks appear to have closed down the r general propaganda campaign for the present mainly for want of funds. Moscow has decided that results have not justified expenditure. Russian activities in Persia are now mainly concentrated on trade, and they have got the trade of Khorasan more into their grip than before. The Customs Officers especially on the frontier are all said to be in th fir pay. 363. Afghan Interests .—The report that Afghan troops have been withdrawn from the Persian frontier (paragraph 335) appears to be incorrect. Junaid Khan, the Turkoman trouble maker and father of the chief rebel in Turkestan, has been sent to Kabul in com pany of Karim Khan Baluch, another stormy petrel. On 19th August the Russian Consul General held a reception in honour of Afghan Independence day, which was at tended by the Governor General and several of the leading Persian Civil officials and the foreign Consuls. A small band of Afghan robbers is giving considerable trouble in the 1 urbat-i-Shaikh Jam district. When pursued by the Mili tary and Amniyeh they escape across the Afghan frontier.

FIL-i COPY, -A ^ w J I Meshed Consular Diary No. 14 for the period ended 31sfc July 1931 282. Personal. —A daughter was born to the wife of Mr. Sandes, Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, on 24th July. On 31st July Mrs. Sandes died as a result of continued high fever, and was buried in the Christian cemetery. Her death is a severe blow to the small British and American community. 283. Persian Interests, (a) Military .— Sarhang Iraj Khan returned to Meshed on 15th July from his inspection tour in the Kuchan and Bujnurd districts. He is well pleased with the condition of affairs in these districts except the Shirwan area, where there are insufficient troops to prevent the influx of Russian refugees. He posted an additional 20 cavalry troopers in the area. The Persian posts in the Turkoman area with the corresponding Russian posts are— (1) Robat . . Garmab. (2) Gifan .. Marganulan and Selonleh. (3) Pervoz and Konakasir. Kariz. (4) Jargalan .. Ghari Kala. (5) Aji and Bharot Chat. The garrison of each Persian military post appears to be 5 cavalrymen but it would appear that they are not yet properly organised. Local Kurd and Turkoman horsemen are to co-operate with these military posts whenever occasion should arise. As the Yamut Turkomans are not so submissive as the Goklans, Sarhang Iraj Khan has ordered periodical visits to be paid to their territory by troops from the Bujnurd district. 284. Artillery of the Behrami regiment proceeded to Shandiz on 23rd July for a month, while a mixed force of all arms went to Turqubeh for the summer. 285. Sultan Mirza Ali Khan has been sent to the Bakharz frontier with 15 sowars to arrest a gang of Afghan bad characters who are operating in that area. 286. Naib Ali Quli Mirza who was appointed to the charge of the Turkoman frontier has resigned and is to be replaced by Yawar Daulat-Shahi. 287. Conscription has commenced at Furouj 20 miles north of Kuchan. ENCLOSURE IN ! INDIA FOREIGN SECRFTARY'3 Letter No 031 .1 Ostert 1 7 SEP. 1931 ihr 5 OCT. 1931 288. (b) Amniyeh .— Sarhang Iraj Khan has restored the responsibility for the safety of the tribal country between Bujnurd and Astrabad to the local Turkoman chiefs who held it before the rebellion of 1926. 289. Two of the robbers operating in the Shah Jahan mountains have been arrested and handed over to the Military Court for trial. 290. Educat on .—Mirza Hadi Khan, Head of the Education Department, left for Tehran on 19th July. 291. (c) Baladiyeh .—Town improve- &lt; ment schemes are beginning to be a nuisance again. Sardar Mota Singh who rents the I Garage-i-Hind is again threatened with eviction from part of his premises to make way for a broad new avenue 'eading to Shahr-i-Nau. It has been suggested to the Governor General that Mota Singh should be left in peace until a new bridge over the moat, which is a necessary part of the scheme, has been built. This proposal was tentatively accepted by the Governor Gene ral three years ago and again last year Threatened lives live long and it is to be hoped that the Garage-i-Hind will survive Mota Singh’s lease, which expires in Octo ber 1932. While the Municipal authorities are busy with new town planning schemes ]i the existing roads remain unrepaired. r 292. (d) Health .—There has been an increase of dysentery in Meshed town, but typhoid has decreased. 293. (e) Agriculture .—The Persian Gov ernment have granted permission for the cultivation of wheat and barley in the Turkoman territory. 294. (/) Customs .—The Customs Depart ment has been very busy owing to the efforts of the Russians to clear their stocks of cotton out of the country. Four officials have been sent to Nishapur to “ plomb ” stocks there. 295. {g) General .—Turkomans who have immigrated to Persian Sarakhs 'from Tejend, Manachacheh, Merv and Russian Sarakhs have been warned by the Persian Government that they can not settle there. They chose 8 representatives who came to Meshed to discuss the question of their future abode with the Persian authorities as most of these immigrants are poor.t 2 ~KU 296 Twenty Turkoman families who entered Persia via Darajaz will be sent to Bahkarz and Nishapur for settlement, while the Malakan families from Russia will be settled at Timurabad 40 miles from Meshed on the Sarakhs road. 297. (h) Communications .—The Turko man road which was prepared for the Shah’s visit was badly damaged by rain and snow. Sarhang Iraj Khan has issued orders for its repair by Turkomans under Military super vision. 298. The new road from Lutfabad to Kuchan is now fit for motor traffic. 299 British Interests .—A considerable number of educated Indians intent on studying re-awakened Persia have been passing through Meshed. Almost all find it necessary to wear the Pahlevi hat. Indeed without this head-dress a visit to the shrine, which is almost the sole object of interest in Persia, is denied them. Mr. Mahomed Habib and Dr. Hadi of the Aligarh University visited Meshed in June, while Professor Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi of St. Stephens College, Delhi, paid a visit during the month. He was introduced to the Governor General, who is pleased that the progress of his country is attracting the attention of educated Indians. Dr. Hadi is expected back in Meshed on 1st August. The Nawab of Dera Ismail Khan and his son Allah Nawaz Khan passed through Meshed on 25th July on their return home from Kngland. They appear to be particularly sturdy John Bulls and failed to be as impressed as their fellow countrymen by the improvements in Persia. 300 . The Governor General informed this Consulate General that he was ordering the deportation of Amrik Singh, Nasib Singh and a Mussalman named Shahji. Subsequently he added that these gentle men were being permitted to go to Tehran to appeal against deportation. Shahji alias Tujummul Husain left for Tehran under Police supervision early in the month and Amrik Singh followed suit on 28th July. Nasib Singh after escaping punishment for running over a woman at Turbat-i- Haidari, gave the Meshed Police the slip and left for Tehran without their knowledge in car No. 1024 belonging to Sardar Sahib Mota Singh. The Nazmiyeh wired infor mation of his departure to Tehran on its coming to their notice. It does not speak well for the Police administration that the Meshed Pol ce were first unaware that a man for whom they were searching was under arrest in TurbaJ-i-Haidari and then let the man who is an unmistakable foreigner belonging to a small and distinctive com munity, slip past their control posts un recognised. 301. Mr. Peek of the War Graves Corm ^ mission visited Meshed on 28th July. He removed from the local cemetery the bodies of 2 officers who had died during the war. The bodies are to be reburied at Kazvin. 302. The plot of ground called Nakhali- yeh, formerly used as Military Transport Lines and subsequently sold to Aminoff the Jew is becoming a nuisance to this Consu late. The Jew has let out portions as tea shops, wine shops and restaurants, with the inevitable result that the ground has been fouled and that the rest of the residents- of the Consulate is at the mercy of an extremely monotous gramophone. Master- less dogs and cats find that portions of the Nakhaliya area offer them very wel come maternity homes. The nuisance has been brought to the notice of Aminofi. 303. Russian Interests. Confidential .— The whole line of the Central Asian Rail way from Krasnavodsk* to Charjui' and beyond is the scene of what appear to be a fairly serious &lt;mta-Bolshevik rising direct ed against the Government’s collectivis ing of agriculture and its a^f-religious policy. The arrival of Sakhi Ishan Imam Verdi was reported in paragraph 277 of Me .hed Diary for the week ending 15th July. Thi&gt; present fortnight has witnessed the arrival of a deputation from Tejend seek ing any foreign aid in arms and ammuni tion from any foreign power for use against the Reds. Their attempt has of course proved a failure. The rising is taking the form of raids on the railway line resulting in dislocation of traffic, and sudden attacks on isolated poTs. As the headquarters of the rebels are in the Kara Korum desert it is parricu- larly hard for the Red Army to take counter neasures. Aeroplanes are being used and one is said to have been shot down. A detachment of Kirgiz Cossacks sent against the rebels deserted to their side. The leader of the rebels is supposed to be the son of Junaid Khan,, who gave trouble in Kho- rasan 2 or 3 years ago. He is described by the Governor General as an excep tionally brave and capable man. The Governor General added that the average Turkoman was not noted for his courage, but for his capacity for sustained exer tion. Turkoman policy was usually to hit and run away.MC 4 G 6 FD— 29 — 25 - 8 - 31 —GIL’S The town of Kizil Arvat n latitude 39° appears to be the centre of attraction for the Turkoman raiders. Other places which have received their attention are the rail way stations at Beled, Balverzan, Kalateh and Geok Tappeh. A successful raid against the Government stud horses in the immediate neighbourhood of Ashka- bad is also reported. This rising although trouble'ome, will probably never assume really serious pro portions owing to the inability of the re bels to unite Junaid Khan though he has considerable prestige is inacceptable as a leader to the Uzbegs as he is a Yamut Turkoman. The rebels would like to re suscitate the Khanate of Khiva, but can not agree as to who should be the ruler. In conversation on the subject Jam expressed the opinion that the duration of the rebellion depends on the military force that the Bolsheviks are prepared to bring into this area. 304. Trouble in Russian territory has led to an increase of immigrants into Persia. The Persian Government officials continue their efforts to keep them out but owing to the length of frontier and the shortage of frontier guards there is a considerable leakage. The usual discussions between the various departments concerned about increasing the posts have been taking place but no results are to be seen. In several cases the Governor General appears to have condoned the offences of unauthorised immigration. The Govern- Distribution :— ment appear quite willing to receive Musul- mans who may develop into good citizens, but endeavour to settle them at some dis tance from the frontier. They are wi ling even to stretch a point in the case of European Russians who are Engineers. The trade in contraband sheep and cat tle across the frontier continues to flour ish. 305. There has been considerable Rus sian activity during the month in order to clear last year’s purchases of cotton out of the country. The cotton which is largely purchased in the Nishapur district is usually exported by camel through Kuchan. Th's year owing to their eagerness to clear stocks before the end of the month of Tir the Russians have been paying as much as 8 krans per pood to the Garage-i-Post for their lorries against the usual rate of 1-50 krans per pood for camel transport. Unfortunately for the Russians a shortage of petrol prevented them from clearing their stocks and those remaining at Nisha pur have been sealed by the Customs De partment. The shortage of petrol was due to the delay of the Persian Government in issuing import licenses for the new quarter which commenced on 1st Tir. Large numbers of tins of petrol aw r aiting the necessary per mission to import were lying in the de sert near Bajgiran. The necessary permission was received before the end of July and the petrol situa tion is now normal. C. C. J.

Persian Interests, (a) Military. —35 recruits conscripted in Nishapur arrived in Meshed on 5th July. 259. Sarhang Iraj Khan has expressed himself as well satisfied with the troops and Amnieh whom he inspected in Kuchan and Bujnurd. He has been busying himself with the question of establishing suitable Amnieh posts in Turkoman territory on the Russian frontier. 260 Sultan Shahbud Din, Recruiting Offi cer in Bajgiran, has written to the Meshed General Staff that workers in the Bolshevik interest have been paying secret visits to the recruits. Two Kurds named ALLU and MAMAO have been arrested as Bolshevic agents in this connection and have been sent to Meshed under escort. 261. Amnieh. —Two Amnieh Sowars have been killed by robbers in the Hazar Masj id hills. A party of 10 Amnieh sowars left Meshed on 10th July to arrest the robbers. 262. Adleiyh. —Roosta arrived in Meshed on 10th July to investigate charges of brib ery brought against employees of the Opium Monopoly Department. 263. Baladiyeh. —No improvement in the state of the roads and buildings in the town is noticeable. The Baladiyeh have however interested themselves in the condition of the Turqubeh road. A Municipal tax of a few krans is levied on each car using this road and the proceeds have been laid out in making the road motorable. This is a distinct benefit to the citizens as all, who can possibly do so, proceed to Turqubeh and the hill villages beyond on Fridays and holidays. The Consulate cars have hitherto been exempted from the tax. Hadi the Rais-i-Baladiyeh continues to be in the bad books of the British and Indian community. His friends of Seistan complain that he no longer returns their salutations. The Manager of the Liquor shop however states that although Hadi takes his whisky without payment, he has no cause for com plaint as the friendship of the Rais-i-Bala diyeh is very useful to him. Town planning scheme. —A partnership between Hadi and Danish, one of the leading Persian trader, has been reported to me. Hadi informs Danish as to which houses in tho danger—aono are-not teqbe destroyed. CMPI nQIIRC IK! ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S .

Health. —The Governor General has now informed this Consulate General (see paragraph 230) that he has instructed the Health Department to furnish it with copies of the Khorasan Health report. 265. Opium. —The Khorasan opium crop has now been deposited in the Government ware houses. Banderoled opium is said to be cheaper in Khorasan than in other parts of Persia so that it is possible for a profit to be made by transporting it to the other pro vinces. To prevent this the Opium Mono- poly Department have declared that such opium in transport is liable to confisca tion. 266. General. —On the 8th July as a con sequence of rain in the hills round Meshed there was a heavy flood near Kalat-i-Nadiri wh ch caused much damage. A fall of hail at Shirwan also was a cause of loss. 267. The Governor General received in formation of the appearance of locusts at Sarakhs. They appear to be a local species only and have not caused damage. 268. The Persian ladies in Meshed led by the newly wedded wife of Sarhang Iraj Khan have taken to tennis. They play twice a week on the private Court of a Per sian attached to His Majesty’s Consulate General. 269. The tannery, which has been built by the Shrine, is almost ready to commence work. Asadi conducted His Majesty’s Con sul-General round it on 4th July. The machinery which has been imported from Germany is in the charge of a German Engineer. Asadi had intended to purchase his dyes also in Germany but the propaganda of the Imperial Chemical’s representative induced him to place his order in England. 270. Communications. —Afshar, Head of the Department of Roads and Communica tions, left Meshed for Shahrud on Inspection duty on 11th July. 271. British Interests. —The withdrawal of Persians from their hitherto friendly intercourse with British subjects has been reported in paragrafdi 263. The leadingIndian trader has informed His Majesty's Consul-General that he used to be on friend ly terms with an officer of the Police, in whose company he used to take a walk once weekly. The Rais-i-Nazmiyeh sum moned the officer and after enquiring the object of these weekly walks, warned him that they must cease at once, as the Indian was on friendly terms with His Majesty’s Consul-General, who visited his house. 272. The dispute between Sardar Sahib Mota Singh and Gyani Attar Singh was mentioned in paragraph 249-A. The Adliyeh requested His Majesty's Consul-General to inform them what actually transpired at the meeting in the Consulate, at which Sardar Gurbachan Singh, a friend of Mota Singh, is said to have admitted that he sold carpets to Ahoodi, the Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, commissioned by Davar to enquire into the conduct of Persian officials concerned with the case. The information required was furnished. It has been reported to His Majesty’s Consul-General that the Adliyeh are sus- picious that Gyani Attar Singh was in stigated by this Consulate to bring charges of bribery against Persian officials. The British are said to be jealous of the success ful working of the Persian Courts since the abolition of the Capitulations. The suspicion is of course absolutely with out foundation but the action taken by Gyani Attar Singh, who did not hesitate to cite the British Consul-General as a witness, shows him to be a very dangerous man. 273. In spite of incidents showing offi cial xenophobia which have been quoted, it is noticeable that Pers an officials have agaia commenced calling at the Consulate General though not so frequently as in the ( period anterior to the incident reported in paragraph 145 of Meshed Diary for the period ending loth May. 274. Confidential .— The leading Indian motor dealer in Meshed reported to the Police that a train of gunpowder had been 1 tid from outside his garage into one of his cars. He suspected that PARANDEH, a Persian rival, intended to blow up all his cars. The Meshed Police have conveyed a verbal message to the Consul-General con- fi lentially that their enquiries do not bear out the Indian’s suspicions. Their theory is that the Indian is on the point of becoming bankrupt and intended to blow up his own cars in order to obtain Insurance money. 275. Russian Interests .—The influx of Russian refugees continues. 1 he greater part of the refugees are rounded up by the Amnieh and returned across the Russiag| border, but a portion manage to eva^ arrest. The Persian frontier guards are not sufficient to deal with the long frontier. The Persian action is taken partly to please the Bolshevic authorities, but there is no doubt that the Persian officials are genuinely afraid of the arrival of G. P. U. agents in the guise of refugees. Many of the employees of Russian firms such as the SHARQ and P. A. N. are G. P. U. agents. The Governor General has accordingly requested the Russian Consul-General to furnish him with a list of all the members of the Russian trading es tablishments in Khorasan. The Police are being more vigilant in their observation of the large number of Russians in Meshed. Anyone found to be without employment will be deported to Russia. As regards Russian propaganda the incident of the two Kurds ALLU and MAM AO who are accused of attempting to corrupt recruits at Bajgiran (on the Russian frontier) with Communist doctrine is of interest. 276. 300 Baluchis originally from Afgha nistan, who had been settled in Russian territory for years, have recently crossed the Persian frontier and are at Zoribad near Sarakhs. They have brought a large number of cattle and sheep with them. They desire to become Persian subjects and the Persian Government are willing to receive them provided they settle further from the frontier. 277. A Turkoman named “ SAKHI ISHAN ” Imam Verdi has come to Meshed and wishes to interest the Governor General in his affairs. Jam who describes this indivi dual as a venerable looking gentleman with a long beard and impressive Turkoman clothes asked His Majesty’s Consul-General if he had any information about this per son, as he was afraid of according him an interview. Imam Verdi wffio claims to pos sess influence from Astrabad to Charjui says he can bring 20,000 Turkomans across the frontier into Persia. Enquiries subsequently made by the Secretary show that Imam Verdi claims to represent the Turkoman protocol which decided on 1st May to set the grievances of the Turkomans under Soviet rule before the League of Nations. Imam Verdi’s preten sions are viewed with suspicion by the local Turkomans, as he w T as actually in Meshed on 1st May and so did not attend the pro tocol. It is possible that he is a Soviet spywhose duty it is to get in touch with dis affected Turkoman families in Russia and report their doings to the Soviet authorities- It is also possible that he may attempt to Council Jam to some anti-Soviet action 'which may be useful to Bolshevic policy if difficulties should arise between the Khora- san and Ashkabad authorities. 278. Afghan Interests .—Sardar Abdul Razzaq, Afghan Consul-General, returned from Tehran on 8th July. 279. The Governor General in conversa tion with His Majesty’s Consul-General confirmed the story reported in paragraph 162 that Abdul Rahim the Governor of Herat himself had organised the raid on the Afghan frontier post at Islam Kaleh. 280. Haji Mahmud Herat!, the Afghan merchant, to whom Abdur Rahim had been making remittances, was killed by his own motor car turning over on him, while crossing a broken bridge on the Kariz road. Haji Mahmud, though an Afghan subject, who had frequently acted as Afghan Con sul-General in Meshed, is said to be possess ed of large estates in Khorasan. 281. Turkish Affairs .—Bahaud Din Effendi, Turkish Vice-Consul, left Meshed on 10th July for Constantinople. He paid a farewell call on this Consulate General. He stated that he intended to return after 2 months and to bring his own and Haqqi Bey’s wife with him to Meshed. C. C. J.

The duties of the Military Attache are in future to be performed by the incumbent of the newly created post of Secretary to the Consul General. The departure of Major Steveni late Military Attache is genuinely regretted by the many Persians and Russians who knew him. Even M. Skaloff the Soviet Consul General while welcoming the exit of a watchful adversary regrets the depar ture of a cheerful conversationalist and an agreeable companion. The Officer Com manding troops was deeply moved at losing a close friend of 3^ years and vented his feelings in a close embrace which was not in accordance with his instructions. 213. Miss Palmer Smith after waiting 5 days in Herat for the floods in the river between Kabul and Kandahar to abate returned to Meshed on 22nd June. She seems to have been struck by the primitive conditions existing in the Afghan province, where she saw two men nailed to a door by their ears, and witnessed another man being carried off to undergo the amputa tion of his hand. 214. Persian Interests, (a) Military .— Durdi Khan Turkoman, head of the Goklan tribe arrived in Meshed on 13th June to discuss questions of the preservation of security on the roads, with the General Officer Commanding Troops in Meshed. 215. Sultan Hasan Khan late of the Military Accounts Department in Persian Baluchistan arrived in Meshed on 14th June. It is said that he has been sum moned by Sartip Nasir-ud-Dowleh as his accounts are in confusion. This gentle man signalled his arrival in Meshed by making himself unpleasant to Shaikh Ahmad son of Khan Bahadur Faiz Mahomed and other Indians who were sleeping on the roof of their caravanserai. 216. Sarhang Iraj Khan acting General Officer Commanding accompanied the Governor General and Asadi the Mutawalli Bashi of the Shrine on a visit to Sarakhs from 18th to 21st June. He gave instruc tions to the local Officer Commanding troops as to the disposal of Russian refugees and sanctioned the temporary increase of the garrisqnj^ 20 sowars.

The conscription of recruits at Kariz has been carried out in an unsatisfactory manners. The whole of recent batch of 30 recruits had to be rejected as not up to standard. 219. Yavar Hasan Khan Daulat Shahi, Head Frontier Commissioner who was stationed at Gif an near Bujnurd has been relieved of his duties owing to incompe tence. Naib-i-Awal Ali Quli Mirza who has been appointed to succeed him left Meshed on 21st June. 220. Five Lur leaders were brought from Tehran to Meshed on 19th June under Amnieh escort. They were sent to Kuchan to join the Lur settlement there. 221. Naib Arsalan Mirza (paragraph 123 of Diary No. 8) a very pleasant scoundrel and son of the Governor of Kermanshah, who was supposed to have made Khorasan too hot to hold him, returned to Meshed on 25th June. He is a close relation of Amir Lashkar Amanulla Mirza and conse quently possesses much influence in the right quarters. 222. Sarhang Iraj Khan left Meshed on 30th June to inspect troops in the Bujnurd district, to arrange for the posting of Amnieh in the Turkoman territory, to establish posts on the Russian front er and to inspect the Turkoman road. 223. Sultan Mohammad Khan, who is said to know English well, arrived in Meshed on 28th June to fake up an appointment on the staff. 224. (b) General. Confidential .—The post of Rais-i-Amnieh in Khorasan must be very lucrative. I hear from a reliable source that the present Rais has asked an aspirant for the post of Rais-i-Amnieh of Meshed Boomiyah for tomans 300 monthly in return for his nomination. A deal will probably be made at tomans 100 monthly. The Rais-i-Amnieh Khorasan is really a most worthy Qajar prince. Further com ment is unnecessary on the success of the 1 Persian Government’s efforts to stamp2 out corruption among its officials, while j continuing to pay ridiculously low ' salaries and increasing the cost of living. 225. Confidential .—The Rais Baladiyali Meshed received a pat on the back at the time of Shah’s visit. That pat has had a most deleterious effect. The condition of the Baladiyah has declined, streets and bridges remain unrepaired and the Meshed Rais appears to have more money. Loud complaints have been heard, and have been supported I hear by no less a person than Aga Zadeh a leading religious personage against the high prices of provisions for sale in the town, which have been fixed by the Baladiyah. It is not known whether there is any connection between the price fixed lor provisions and the increasing affluence of the head of the commission of control, but it is reliably reported that in connec tion with a land transaction a receipt for 26,000 Tomans which had not been paid was demanded. On the victims threaten ing to complain to Tehran the Rais retort ed by asking whether they really thought the whole Tomans 26,000 was to remain in Meshed and that Tehran had no share in the profits. Our estimable Governor Gen eral so I am told is not altogether free from stain in the matter. It would be regrettable if he lost his reputation for honesty. However, prosecutions of con- | scription Department and other minor officia’s for the offence of receiving illegal gratifications still continue as Government is determined to stamp out dishonesty in the administration. 226. Jevalti Director of Customs at Kariz has been recalled to Meshed at his own request and Mirza Mahomed Khan Hari-Tash has been appointed in his place. 227. Daudi Rais-i-Auqaf has gone to inspect the schools and Auqafs at Nishapur. He has arranged that Haji Shariat | Muddar, a leading Mulla and landlord of Nishapiy should give property worth Tomans 20,000 as endowment for a school : in Nishapur. This Mulla had got hold of the property by a trick from a dying man. Daudi caused 53 school boys at Nishapur who were suffering from various infectious diseases such as (favia) to be sent home. The Shrine and Educational authorities are making praiseworthy efforts to cope with infectious diseases in schools. They are trying to persuade the Municipality to | dea 1 with the danger that lurks in the ' filthy public baths. 228. Asadi the Mutawafli Bash! of the shrine accompanied the Governor General and General Officer Commanding Troops on their journey to Sarakhs. He went to inspect certain Crown lands of w Inch Ufc has recently taken the lease. It is a pity that Asadi’s many private ventures are interfering with his duties in the Shrine. During the past three months the usual Shrine grant of 5 krans monthly for the maintenance of each leper in the Shrine Hospital, small enough in all conscience has not been paid. Dr. Lichtwardt has protested to the Governor General who was surprised to find that he was President of the Committee of Management. Asadi informed the Consul General that the difference between Persian Sarakhs and Russian Sarakhs (the river Tejend runs between) was most marked. In the Persian village the cost of barley was only Tomans 3 per Kharwar while in the Russian village 100 yards away the price was over 20 Tomans, and that price was only nominal as none was obtainable, j On my remarking that there must be j much smuggling he stated that there was i none, owing to the vigilance of the j Russian frontier guards, who shoot first and ask questions afterwards. 229. Dr. Abul Qassim Khan Saghap has been nominated Head of the Public Health Department at Nishapur. 230. There has been an outbreak of small pox in Meshed, but details are lacking. A request has been made to the Governor General for information as to outbreaks of infectious diseases, but he has not made any reply. It is presumed that he has had to refer to Tehran for orders. 231. The Financial Department has filed a suit against certain landlord claiming that the property they hold is crown land. 232. The Revenue Department has re ceived orders to pay salaries to Government officials, regularly in future, instead of delaying payment as has so often been the custom in the past. 233. The Registration Department has opened branch offices at Turqubeh and Shandiz which are the hill stations of Meshed. Representatives of the Depart ment are touring the villages. 234. Owing to the excellent rains the harvest of wheat and opium is excellent. The rain fall of June has done very little harm to opium. The price of wheat in Kuchan is 8 Tomans per Kharwar and of3 barley 56 krans but there are no buyers. The price of opium has fallen owing to the new crop being brought to market. 235. The price of opium has been fixed at 1 kran 4 shahis per miscal including the T banderole tax of 10 shahis which was ? reduced to this figure on 24th June. 236. The Monopoly Department have confiscated a store of 493 miscals of contca- | band opium. Shaibani the new head of the department has ordered 50 Shireh Khaneh (opium dens) to be closed. 237. Nawai Rais-i-Naznra Khorasan visited Turbat-i-Haidari and Birjand on inspection duty. He has submitted a pro posal to Tehran for the increase of the Meshed Police to 325 men. 238. Izzatullah Khan Shujahi, acting Head of the Opium Monopoly in Khorasan has been appointed Head of the Revenue : Department in the Persian Gulf. 239. A certain amount of disorders is reported from the Shahjehan Mountains between Kuchan, Bujnurd and Sabzewar, where the hillmen are committing rob beries. 240. Pour robbers who looted the post between Kuchan and Shiriwan and carried off 1,500 Tomans on 25th June, have now been arrested. 241. Afshar Head of the Roads and Com munications Department returned to Meshed on 29th June from an inspection in Bujnurd and Turkoman Sarai. Large numbers of labourers are repairing the road between Bujnurd and Gumbad-i-Kabus. 242. Four lorries conveying 70 passen gers recently travelled on the road from Turshiz to Tabas. 243. Haji Hussain Aga Kashaniski for merly in the service of the Russian Con sulate General has been appointed by Meshed merchants as their representative in Tehran to facilitate the receipt of trade permits from the Department concerned. 244. The order prohibiting the export of white wool to Russia has been with drawn. 245. Goods are now permitted to pass across Persia in transit on payment of 10 shahis per Tabrizi man as rah dari. 245 (a). The orders allowing the Customs Department a certain latitude in dealing with contraband goods have been with drawn and customs officials have been directed to proceed strictly according to law. 246. The Bank-i-Pahlavi has brought Mazanderan rice to Meshed by the all Per sian route to demonstrate to the traders MC323FD that the use of this route is cheaper than that through Ashkabad, in transit. 247. The election of the members of the Meshed Chamber of Commerce will be held on 10th July. 248. Zanjani, Public Prosecutor of the Meshed Appeal Court, who had resigned his appointment in a huff because he had been fined 15 Tomans for continually attending office late, was amazed to find that his resignation had been accc;pted. Attempts to recall the resignation were defeated by the Law Minister’s habit of attending office at 6 a m. The Rais-i- Adlieh’s telegram announcing Zanjani’s resignation have been placed in Dawar’s hands, the first thing in the morning. Ziauddin Nuri has been appointed to succeed Zanjani. The resignation of Zan jani is regretted in Meshed. 249. A slight earthquake occurred at Shirvan on 23rd June. There was no damage. 249-A. British Interests. —The long standing dispute between Mota Singh and # Giani Attar Singh is becoming more embit tered. It is a wretched case which started ten years ago and could have been settled then by the payment of Rs. 300. It has become exceedingly complicated and charg es of smuggling of gold, bribery, highway robbery and forgery are mixed up in it. As the parties were obviously ruining them selves in the dispute His Majesty’s Consul General made an attempt to persuade the two parties to come to an agreement to accept a compromise to be arranged by 3 leading members of the Indian commu nity. The parties had first agreed but later withdrew their consent and Giani Attar Singh in the presence of His Ma jesty’s Consul General charged Mota Singh’s party with giving a bribe to the Inspector sent down by the Ministry of Justice to enquire into the conduct of the Persian officials connected with the case. He also brought a formal charge against the Per sian Inspector, which a second Inspector has been appointed to investigate. A summons has now been issued to two members of this Consulate Staff to appear before the Court in connection with this case. It is not known on what points they are to be examined, as they have only general hearsay knowledge. 250. Muhammad Rafi a sepoy of the Indian Army had need of a certificate fromr 4 tlie Naib Hakim of Mian Wilayat on a certain document. This was duly certified and sealed with the Government seal by Mustafa Khan Durrani. On the certifi cate being taken to the Assistant Governor General it was found that Mustafa Khan had no right to give any certificate or use the Government seal as he had long ceased to be Naib Hakim of the district. The Assistant Governor General was not i in the least disconcerted by this mis use of Government seals. 251. The news that the Duzdap Railway was about to cease functioning in Persian territory was received with incredulity by Persian merchants. The Governor General addressed the Consul General on the subject and was infoimed that according to information received the train would run only as far as Nok Kundi, but that as far as he was aware the question was still under discussion with the Persian Government. The Governor General passed on this news to the traders. The new arrangement has disconcert ed the carpet exporting firms such as the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers and Shahi- niantz, and certain Persian traders state that it will cause them loss, but the Indian community appear at prerent to be quite unperturbed. An Indian traders went so far as to tell His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General that he made much better profits before there was a railway to Duzdap, The fact of the matter is that in spite or because of the trade restrictions certain firms dealing in wines and stores are making huge profits. The chief difficulty is to get profits out of the country. A Sikh firm however reports that lack of business has reached such a pitch that they have already closed their Birjand branch and will close their Meshed business au soon as they have collected outstandings. They will keep open their Duzdap branch, transfering it if necessary into British terrb tory. Lack of business is caused by Trade Restrictions and has no connection with the Duzdap Railway. 252. Russian Interests. —The Russians are overenjoyed at the news of the Duzdap Railway and have beep spreading the glad i tidings in the town. 253. Numbers of Russian refugees con tinue to cross the frontier, but the Persians round them up and return them to Russia A territory. 254. Daniloff the new head of the Shark Company has taken over charge. The Russian Bank has a new Manager named Gregory off Kennekoff. ^ 255. Two Jadids named Rahman Dadoff and Daud Murtazoff who were proceeding to Europe for medical treatment have been arrested presumably for smuggling roubles. Rahman who was an old man died in prison. The local paper “ Bahar ” publishes an article deploring the sad fate of Persian merchants proceeding through Russia for medical treatment. 256. Afghan Affairs. —Haji Kazim Agha Ali Asgharoff asked for permission to send a 1 consignment of 300 boxes of Herat opium each containing 24 mans via Chaman in transit across India. After reference to the Government of India the request was refused. According to Haji Kazim Agha he has at present either to export his opium across Persia to Bushire in which case he has to pay the Persian Government 800 tomans or £80 out of the £210 he re ceives at Bushire, or he has to deliver his opium to the Russians at Kushk, who pay him £150 per case. He was looking forward to considerable profit if transit across India had been per mitted. 257. Confidential. —The Persian Gov ernment sent secret agents to Herat to report the true facts of the affair reported in my paragraph 162 of Diary No. 9, Ac cording to these agents the raid near Islam Kala was organised by Abdur Rahim, Governor of Herat himself. His object was \ to induce the inhabitants of the province to wire Kabul to say that none could pro tect them except Abdur Rahim and they had no faith in any other Governor, The story seems far fetched but it was j certainly reported to the Persian Govern ment. It has many parallels in Khora- san history in the bad old days. Nizam- i us-Sultaneh is said to have been a master at this sort of intrigue. It is reported that Abdul Rahim is mak ing large remittance to Haji Mahmud Herat! in Meshed, to safeguard his future. When he is forced out of Herat he will make fpr Meshed and his fortune.. C. C. J.

Hamber, 1st Gurkha Rifles accompanied by Mrs. Hamber arrived at Meshed on 27th May. He is to relieve Major Steveni of the duties per formed by him as Military Attach^, but he will be known in future as Secretary to the Consul-General. The Bolshevik Consulate is very intrigued at the departure of Mr. I Jakins synchronising with the arrival of a new Secretary and it is anxious to know whether Major Hamber is relieving Mr. Jakins. 189. The Consul-General introduced Major Hamber to the Governor General as his Secretary on 2nd June. 190. Miss Palmer Smith arrived from Tehran on 5th June and left for Herat on 9th. Before her departure she was warned in writing by directions of His Majesty’s Minister that the British Government could accept no responsibility for her safety in Afghanistan. She professed to be pleased by this assurance. She has promised His Majesty’s Consul-General that she will not proceed beyond Herat unless satisfied by the Governor of Herat’s assurance that all was safe. No telegram deprecating the trip was received from His Majesty’s repre sentative at Kabul though he had been informed of Miss Palmer Smith’s inten tions. It is presumed, therefore, that Afghanistan is safe at present for an English lady armed with Miss Smith’s credentials. 191. On 3rd June the Consul-General held his usual reception in honour of the King’s birthday. It was noticeable that the only civil officials who attended were \ the Governor General, the Assistant Govern- | or General, the Rais-i-Nazmiyeh and the Rias-i-Baladieh. Sarhang Iraj Khan inspite of the warn ing conveyed to him (see paragraph 145) said that he could not be so rude as to fail to call to congratulate the Consul- General on his King’s birthday, when a call had been made on him at the No Ruz. He attended therefore in the Governor Gene ral’s train instead of independently as has been the custom for the military in previous years. No other military officer called at the Consulate. The customary Garden Party had to be postponed till 5th June owing to heavy rain and cold so severe that fires had to be lit for the dinner to the British commu nity. The Garden Party which was held on 5th June was very well attended by the Indian community, but Persian officials both Civil and Military were noticeable by their absence. The Governor General himself, who had assured the Consul-General that all officials would come if invited, came late and the Heads of Police and Municipality were later still. The Assistant Governor General alone attended punctually. Sarhang Iraj Khan could not face the publicity of a Garden Party. Persian officialdom in Meshed appears to have held out longer than elsewhere in Persia against Taimur Tache’s edicts against intercourse with foreigners but has succumb ed at last. The richer merchants of course take their cue from the officials. 192. Persian Interests, {a) Military .— Sultan Abul Fazl Mirza, head of the Con scription Department in Nishapur informed a member of the Consulate staff that 3.000 recruits from Nishapur and Sabzawar had to be drafted to Tehran, Half this number have already left. 193. Sartip Nasir-ud-Dowleh who had been to Sistan and Zahedan for inspection states that affairs there especially in Ac counts matters are unsatisfactory. 194. It is reported that the Persian Government have chosen a place called KHARAKY situated on the banks of the ARTAK about fifty miles from Bujnurd for the settlement of the Lurs, and build ings are now under construction for their accommodation. The roads in the Turcoman country are at present impassable owing to the heavy floods, as has also been a portion of the road between Bujnurd and Shirwan. Peace prevails in the Turcoman country a few robbers who had been out having been captured and the experiments of entrusting the Amnieh posts to the Turco mans# themselves appears to have beenI 2 successful. Conscription has given rise to no undue difficulty in the Bujnurd area. 195. (b) General. —The Amnieh have arrested Yusuf alias Sardar who had been plundering in the hills of Ilazar Masjid^ and also Ghulam Reza, a robber in the Shirwan district. 196. The Commander of the Amnieh post at Tabrak between Kuchan and Darajaz when taking the pay of his troops for dis bursement was robbed on the road near Darbandi. Two of his party were wounded by the robbers. 197. The Muharram passed off quietly. The usual processions were curtailed to the Shrine quarter. ' r 198. Shaikh Murtaza, a leading Mujtahid of Meshed died on the 10th June. His funeral was attended by a vast concourse of people as he was greatly beloved by the poorer classes. The Bazaars were closed in his honour. 199. Sadiq Khan and Majlisi have been appointed to posts in the Department of Justice at Kuchan. 200. Mirza Hasan Khan Shaibani has been appointed Head of the Opium Mono poly Department. 201. The Opium Monopoly Department have issued orders prohibiting transactions in opium prior to its deposit in the Govern ment warehouse. 202. The custom of taking Khorasani sheep over the Russian frontier for grazing has been prohibited and the Government have prohibited the expprt of white wool to foreign countries. The traders have wired to Tehran protesting against this latter order. 203. The traders of Daragaz have been renewing their representations for the im provement of their communications Ku chan, as they cannot import merchandise from Artik (a station on the Russian Rail way). 204. The Governor General has received a report of the appearance of locusts near Shusp. The local locust expert has left to organise cmta-locust measures. 205. The cold and rain were very pro longed this year. 2-80 inches of rain fell in April, 2-53 in May and 1-33 up to 6th June. The rain though very favourable to the wheat crop, has done harm for opium. Summer heat has now set in and the maxi mum thermometer registers 92°, 94° and 96° daily. 206. British Interests. —Maulvi Maho med Latif, a preacher, who holds a Jritish MC26S1D—20—8-7-31—GIPS Passport and seems to have been well- known to Miss Gertrude Bell in Iraq, was guilty of the indiscretion of uttering public criticism of the Shah. He was arrested^ and has been ordered to leave Persia. Hf proposes to proceed to India but to have his . family in Meshed. 207. Ghulam Hussain, a British subject was killed on 3rd June owing to the collapse of Gulshan’s serai caused by heavy rain. 208. Russian Interests. —M. Skaloff, Soviet Consul-General, returned to Meshed on 4th June and accompanied by M. Skaloff and M. Diktarich attended the Garden Party at the British Consulate General next day. The Consul-General called on him on 15th June to introduce his new Secretary Major Hamber. 209. Somailoff, the Russian Engineer under orders to leave the country owing to the Agabegoff disclosures was still in Meshed on 1st June. He left on 11th June. 210. The arrival of numerous Russian refugees is still being reported. The Per sians have been taking measures to intercept them at the frontier but several manage to get through to Meshed. In this connection a Russian officer arrived at Sarakhs and dis cussed matters with the Persian Commander of Troops. The smuggling of cattle and sheep from Persia into Russia was also mentioned. 211. Afghan Affairs. —Abdul Baqi Khan formerly Afghan Consul-General accom panied by his son arrived in Meshed en route for Herat. It is understood that the visit is purely private and is connected with landed property he holds in Herat district. C. C. J.

Sarhang Abbas Qidi Khan Isfandiari accompanies the party while in Pers an limits. The Governor General gave a garden party in their honour on the 13th May, and on the 15th the leading citizens of Meshed were invited by M. Haardt leader of the expedition to inspect the cars and accessories at Bahrabad about 8 miles from Meshed. The French flag was much in evidence as it was flying from the top of the Wireless mast and was used along with the Persian flag to decorate the camp and the cars. Presumably the Persian Gov ernment had permitted the importation of the Wireless set on the plea that it was Radio Concert It was also used to take down wireless messages from France. Meshed received its first news of the elec tion of M. Doumer as French President from this source. Foreign Consuls were in vited both by the Governor General and M. Haardt. £&gt;uch invitations would in pre vious years have been a matter of course, but now they are the exception, as the Persian Government have recently redoubl ed their efforts to isolate foreign repre sentatives. Sarhang Iraj Khan commanding the | troops in Meshed, who recently visited ■ Tehran has been warned by the Shah himself j that all social relations with foreign Consu lates in Meshed must cease at once. Iraj Khan alleges that he ventured a protest and vouched for the absolutely correct attitude of his friends in His Majesty’s V Consulate General, but was cut short with the instruction that he must obey orders which were for the good of Persia.

The Red Lion and Sun Society is collecting subscription for the sufferers from the flood (see paragraph 137) The Governor General says that the losses in Meshed are estimated at tomans 100,000. It is understood that Russian subjects living near the moat suffered severely. The Russ an Consul General called on the Governor General to express sympathy and gave a handsome subscrip tion in aid of the sufferers. In addition to damage in Meshed town a certain amount of loss has been caused by floods in the Kashaf Rud, and by hail in the country districts, 154. The budget of the Meshed Munici pality has been sanctioned. Hadi the Head of the Meshed Municipa lity returned on 7th May. He states that he has started Municipalities at Turbat-i- Ha dari and Birjand and that the Govern ment have alloted them tomans 15,000 and tomans 20 ; 000 annually. 155. New orders defining the duties of Governors General and Governors have been promulgated. They give these officials certain supervisory powers over all offices in their districts to settle disputes and to prevent action which they consider dan gerous to domestic or foreign policy. 156. British Affairs. —Mrs. Edwin Montagu, accompanied by Mr. Rupert Bellville, after losing the Gipsy Moth Aeroplane in which they proposed to fly to Russia, arrived in Meshed from Sabza war at 3-15 a.m. on Sunday 3rd May. They left for Tehran by Junkers plane on 7th May. While in Meshed they attended a tea party organised by the Indians -at-the-Hotel ENCLOSURE !N r^'DIA nJREIQN : : .pc-r A 'v | L etisr 92 27 jUL 1931Moderne on 6th May, at which Gur- baehan Singh delivered a speech extoll ing the eminent services of the late Mr. Montagu on behalf of India. 157. Russian Affairs .—On the 11th May the Russians organised an exhibition of agricultural machinery at the village of Bojmahun about 1| miles outside Meshed. A tent had been pitched for the Governor General, Heads of Departments and Foreign representatives, who had all been specially invited. In spite of the threat of rain there was a good attendance. An assortment of ploughs, reapers and churns was shown in action, and it is hoped that orders will now be received for their supply to the larger landholders. The ploughs and reapers were all suitable for animal traction as more in accord with Persian needs. The effect would have been better had the horses and oxen been more accustomed to the implements they were dragging and to the presence of a large crowd. After the exhibition M. Skaloff gave a “ tea party ” at the Russian Consulate (teneral at which tea was almost absent but was replaced by limitless alcoholic beverages and a cold buffet. The proceed ings, at which friendliness was displayed, terminated with a cinema performance. 158. Basil Karakoff, Soviet Consul in Darajaz visited Meshed on 4th May. The head of the Bureaupers at Bajgiran arrived in Meshed on 9th May. 159. As a result of the protest of the Governor General the rice belonging to Persian merchants which had been attached by the Russians at Artik has been released and will be brought to Khorasan. 160. Three Russians wdio arrived at Kariz across Afghan territory were arrested by the Ammeh and sent back to Russia. 161. A traveller from Bajgiran calling himself Ruhullah who was possessed of a P&lt;^ sian Passport put up at the Hotel Moden^^ He came under suspicion and was arrested. It was found that he was travelling with a forged passport. He did not improve matters by offering a bribe to the Rais-i- Police. 162. Afghan Affairs .—Afghan post at Islam Kaleh appears to have had trouble with a gang of smugglers. The Afghan Consul General s account of the affair is that several robbers approached Zirchah near Islam Kaleh and were confronted by the Government troops. Reinforcements were summoned from Herat and an engage ment took place in which a few men were killed on each side and one of the smugglers was captured. The Governor General’s version of this affair was that 400 men had come from Herat and had attacked the Afghan post at Islam Kaleh. Yet another story re presented the affair as a raid by supporters of ez-King Amanullah on the Afghan Gov ernment post, in which the Afghan sol diers had acquitted themselves very badly. Four men sent by the Kabul Government to Herat as spies are said to have come under the suspicion of Abdul Rahim. 1 hey saved themselves by leaving Herat by night. No transport was availal3le so that they had to walk to Sabzawar (Afghanistan) where they procured a lorry which took them to Farah. Turkish Affairs. —Nil. 163.

The contents of these reports is said to be interesting. Among other items of news were the statements:— (1) that 9 British Officers have arrived from India to prepare a war map and are staying at the British Consulate. This obviously refers to the purely private visit of Captain Freeland and his friends. (2) The British are interfering on behalf of their subjects in cases pending in the Adlieh. This is merely a lie. (3) The Chief of Staff is causing his military reports to be shown to the British, which is another lie. (4) Large numbers of Azerbaijani Turks have visited Meshed for pilgrimage. This is true. Afghan Affairs. —Nil. 185. Turkish Affairs. —Haqqi Bey’s Friday prayers still arouse comment. People seem unable to bring themselves to believe that the Turkish Consul may really be as devout as the Afghan. 186. Bahuuddin Bey the Vice Consul appears to be short of cash. He has recent ly made an attempt to borrow Tomans 300 from the Attache at His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate General. An explanation is now forthcoming of his expression of extreme fondness for the British, which he “ could not show openly ”, and his desire to enter tlie Attache’s quarters by a private door. C. C.

Anxiety for his father’s illness is given as the reason for the visit but the Sarhang will doubtless, take the oppor tunity to sound his ground in the capital. The wives and families of Naib Awal Arsalan Mirza and of Bahman Mirza, acting Chief of the General Staff in Meshed left at the same time. 124. Sultan Muhammad Karim Khan, Commander of the garrison of Turbat-i- Haidari and Khaf came to Meshed for orders on April 19 and returned on April 22. 125.

Kai Ostovn passed through Meshed ‘ on the way to take up his appointment as Persian Consul in Karachi. A person w^ho knew him in Tehran has stated that Ostovn was formerly very closely associated with j Bolshevik intrigues there. 131. The Governor General has received , instructions to permit no archaeological excavations that have not been authorised by the Government. 1 132. Kamran, the chief of the provin cial Sijil Ahwal, has returned from a tour of Turbat-i-Haidari, Gunabad, Fardous, Bushruieh, Tabas and Turshiz establishing branch offices at the first and last of these places and arranging for the augmentation of the staff elsewhere. 133. Boys with skin diseases of the head (wffiieh are very common in the town and chiefly of syphilitic origin) have been pro hibited from attending school until cured. A movement is also on foot to improve the location of the existing school buildings now very subject to damp. 134. Three Bakhtiyari Khans, Sardar-i- Fateh, Amir-i-Mujahid and Shahabus-Sul- taneh wffio seem to have been implicated in disturbances around Isfahan last year have come to Meshed from Tehran. It is under stood that they have been “ exiled ” to Meshed. 135. The “ Azadi ”, a minor newspaper of Meshed which receives subsidies from the Bolsheviks, considered in a recent article that the propagation of Christian literature constituted an abuse of the liberty assured by the existing regime in Persia. The writer stated his conviction that Christian evangelisation could never succeed but added that nevertheless it ought to be | stopped. 136. A further m w'spaper to be called the “ Urdi Behesht ” is about to be started in Meshed by Mirza Abdullah Khan Keshawarz. It will probably appear once a w’eek to begin with and is to be printed by the “ Bahar ” newspaper press. 137. Abnormal rainfall for more than tw T o weeks, following an unpleasantly premature attempt at summer w r eather, has fallen in the province. In the neighbourhood of Meshed the rains have been particularly heavy and anxiety is being felt for the crops. A torrent cut the Tehran road at Turuq tw o farsakhs outside the town and carried away a touring car drowning a woman and child ENCLCSU t i NDIA Fi 0RE*G'.' Letter £1 ' . I' ■' i FkcJ 6 JUL 19312 and holding up traffic for several days. On April 29 a cloudburst brought a flood of water into the moat surrounding the town. The level of the water rose from a few inches to even 20 feet in as many seconds washing away 130 houses and caravanserais together with sheep, cattle and hens. The total damage is estimated at 100,000 tomans. 138. British Affairs. —The Sikh Gur- dwara in Meshed was broken into on the / night of 26-27 April by thieves who carried away carpets and furnishings, to the value of 289 tomans and even took the cloth covering the sacred books. 139. Bulandgah Muhammad Askari Bahadur with a suite of ten persons arrived in Meshed on pilgrimage on April 27 and called on His Majesty’s Consul General and on the Governor General. 140. Russian Affairs. —The Soviet Consul General is said to be contemplating a visit to Sistan in company with the local mana ger of the Shark company. 141. Afghan Affairs. —On the occasion of the Id Qurban, April 29, the Afghan Consul General received the Governor- General, the foreign representatives and the heads of department. In the evening a receiption of European and American wives of Meshed was held. 142. Zia Hamayun, formerly Private Secretary to King Amaniillah arrived in Meshed on April 23 and left for Tehran on April 27. He is a Persian who ran a shop in Tehran some twenty years ago subsequently being taken into service by Sipahdar, Minister of the Interior. From this employment he passed into the French Legation as interpreter whence he accom panied a M. Fisher to Afghanistan. He attracted the attention there of e^-King Amanullah marrying a Mahomedzai wife and eventually being taken into the royal service first as French teacher. At the time of the revolution he took refuge in the Persian Legation at Kabul and was eva cuated by air to India. After the executic^^ of Bacha Saqo he returned to Kabul whe^ he seems to have received a small pension, but falling under suspicion of working for the return of Amanullah was told to leave the country. In Meshed he called on the Afghan Consul General and, when they happened to be out, on His Majesty s Consul General and on the Governor Gene ral. He appears to have received no one apart from Haji Mahmud Herat! who is the wealthiest as well as the most influential Afghan merchant in Meshed. It is re ported that Toimur Tache has promised Zia Hamayun employment under the Persian Government. 143. Syed Abdulla Khan of the Afghan Ministry for Foreign Affairs passed through Meshed on his return to Kabul (via India) after two years in Mazar-i-Sharif. He was accompanied by Muhammed Rahim who also carried an Afghan diplomatic passport He left his card on His Majesty’s Consul General. 144. Turkish Affairs—The announce ment of the Turkish Consul that on the Id Qurban that he would accompany the Caucasian Turks to prayer at the Gauhar Shad mosque (which adjoins to Shrine of the Imam Reza) was received by the local public authorities with great suspicion and constables were posted in all the passages leading to the mosque “ to avoid distur bance ”. The authorities are probably right in considering Haqqi Bey’s religious zeal as feigned but to imagine some political motive underlying his conduct is surely absurdly suspicious. G. C. J.

The local Sabt-i-Asnad has receiv ed from Tehran special forms for use in transactions concerning the transfer of im movable properties and an order that such transactions must in future take place through the department and not privately j or with the aid of a mullah. 118. British Affairs. —It now appears that the action of Syed Mahmoud (not Syed Modyoff as previously stated) with regard to the Shusp rest house (see paragraph 101) arose from a misapprehension. The ins tructions issued were for the preparation of a list of all caravanserais and waqf buildings on the road. These were to be taken under supervision and estimates for necessary repairs drawn up. The Governor General stated in a letter dated April 11 that he had instructed Syed Mahmoud to leave the Shusp rest house alone and had administer ed a reprimand. * * 112. As the result of the last two months conscription 1,000 recruits are said to have been despatched from Sabzawar to serve with the artillery in Tehran, while 450 re cruits from Nishapur have come into Mesh ed. 113.

It was pointed out to the Turkish Consul that he took perhaps too serious a view of the report which had probably reached his Embassy via Tabriz. Ismail Haqqi Bey refused to accept this sugges tion. He claimed the Turkish Consul-Gene ral in Tabriz as a trusted friend who was incapable of such an action and reiterated his conviction of Soviet machinations. He left at the end of a visit which, if perhaps unnecessary, at least does him credit, placated if not erttirely comforted. The report which produced this tea-cup storm emanated from the Assistant Governor General. C. C. J. BARRETT, His Britannic Majesty s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan.

Ismail Haqqi Bey appears to have been reprimanded by his Embassy for this indiscretion and called on I His Majesty’s Consul-General to explain the position. He said he had returned a spirited reply to the Turkish Ambassador. It was bad enough that a man of his expe rience and length of service should be in sulted by the implication that he was igno rant on questions of protocol but it was worse that he should be the victim of a shameless lie.

Account of a Car journey from Meshed to ^®Tehran i a. March 1931. 18th March. —Left Meshed at 9-15 a.m- At 8 miles crossed the Turuq stream and entered the mountain section which con tinued till mile 46. Road surface good as far as Sharifabad (26 miles) thence badly cutup as far as Qadamgah 53 9 miles. Between Sharifabad and Qadamgah cross 3 or 4 running streams of which the largest is at the Amnieh post at mile 40. The mountain section ends at 46 miles and the plain of Nishapur is entered. Road good till Nishapur 71 miles and for 24 miles beyond (95 miles from Meshed) though a series of dips some of which contain running water prevent really high speeds. At 95 miles enter low hills. The road is cut up and switch backing till 105 miles. Until 113 miles the road surface is fair and then be comes good. This portion of the road is through hills. From 132 miles until Sabza- war (143 miles) a new road with very fair surface is traversed. Distance from Meshed to Sabzawar 143 which took 5 hours 55 minutes running time. Sabzawar has a large garage called Garage-i-Massis with clean upper rooms containing beds with clean sheets. The rooms are fitted with electric lights but of only 10 candle power, so a reading lamp is necessary. Sabzawar to Shahrud. 19th March. —Left Sabzawar 7-45. Road good for 5 miles to the Khosrugil minaret. Enter cultivation and a bad patch of road. 9 a.m. reached Rivand village. The road runs through this village and several others in this neighbourhood. Crowds, curves and running streams in the villages made driving difficult. 9-35 reached Mahr. 9-50 reached Sudkhar where a 10 minutes halt was made. From here the road surface improved though the road was very undulat ing at 50 miles Kahak. At 11-25 reached Sadrabad. (67). In this neighbourhood, even close to villages, the road is free from irrigation cuts. At 11-30 a.m. crossed the Pul-i- Abrisum (69) miles. Care should be taken to turn right handed to the bridge and not to follow the straight road to the river. Abbasabad reached at 11-50 a.m. (77-3 miles). Ten minutes halt at Garage. Road now passes through low hills. The road until close to Shahrud dotted with watch towers which were formerly, gar risoned to protect wayfares from Turkoman raids.

Road which has a good surface now passes through low hills. At 1-30 reached Zaidan (115*4 miles) with a pleasant halting place and shady trees near a running stream. Halted for 25 minutes. The road now runs along the foot and to the left of a high hill. Fertile villages to the right, At 122 miles reached Maiamai through which the road passed. The road was crowded inside the village. From Maiamai an Excellent Straight Road Marred by one Sudden Sharp Drop, runs for 10 miles. At 132 njiles enter low hills. The surface of the road from here to Sharhud (163*2 miles) is quite fair. Arrived at Shahrud at 4-02 p.m. In the early part of this stage the road was much obstructed by streams. In the neigh bourhood of Shahrud also there s obstruc tion from cultivation. Shahrud to Sam nan. 20th March. —As far as Damghan (43 *4 miles) the road was excellent as soon as the car was clear of the town. In Shahrud itself the road was congested and near the main bazaar a running stream crossed the road. There are no obstructions till mile 32*3 where caution is necessary owing to a stream across the road. At miles 33 and 35 two other streams across the road. At 41*4 miles the road curves. A stream is crossed, At Damghan the police inspect passports. Running time from Shahrud to Damghan (1 hour and 25 minutes). Left Damghan at 9-18 a.m. From Damghan to Gusheh (71 miles) the road is excellent and a speed of 40 miles was maintained for several miles in spite of a strong head wind. At Gusheh cross a. stream and the road deteriorates at once. A serpentine course is followed. After about 5 miles the road begins to ascend. At 10-58 Ahuan which is 0.500' above the sea was reached. Here there is an Amnieh post and there is an old caravanserai but no village. There is good water. Halted 20 minutes. The. road continues to rise through the hdis and a little second gear 34 was necessary. At 06 miles a picturesque village and a steep and winding rise which had to be taken on second gear. Tne old road leaves on the left. At 98 miles a river bed was crossed. At 102 miles the old road rejoins and the road is definitely descend ing. At 108 miles the steepest part of the descent is over. At 12-10 reached Samnan (116 miles). Semnan to Tehran. As this is a hilly section a more detailed account of the journey is given. At 7-38 left Semnan. At 4 miles the old road to Tehran continues to the left while the new motor road turns to the right. At 6-3 miles the road begins to climb. At 9-7 miles the climb becomes steeper. At 13-5 miles crossed a dry river bed. From 15-5 to 16*7 there are three bad hair pin bends. At 21*6 miles cross a bridge. At 30 miles a very steep ascent. At 32-1 miles an oil outpost of the 1\ A. N. At 42-3 miles there was running water on the road. At 43-5 miles enter a gorge and at 43*8 cross a bridge. At 46-5 miles there was a big flow of water on the road. At 9-49 a.m. the road branching to Mazan- dran was reached at 48*5 miles. There is a serai here at which cars usually stop. A halt of 25 minutes was made. At 51-5 miles passed Firuz Kuh vil lage.

The stretch from mile 123-5 to 126-5 although the surface is fairly good contains many hair-pin bends. There were many running streams cross ing the road where the car had to be braked as care was necessary when crossing. As snow fell on the day of the journey the streams were probably more numerous than usual and in the dry season many of them would be dry. The section is on the whole good. Note.—T he journey was made before the full effect of the melting snow was felt. Except for the portion from Semnan to Tehran, w-hich was made during a snow storm, the whole journey was favoured with good weather. It is recommended that the journey be divided as follows :— First day Meshed to Sabzawar 143 miles in 6 hours. Second day Sabzawar to Damghan 210 miles in 9 hours. Third day Damghan to Tehran 213 miles in 8?. hours. Car 30 H. P. Buick, 1930. MCI03FD—25—19.5-31—GIPS. CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Consular Diary No. 3, for the period ended 15th Febraary 1931.

The Governor General has an nounced that 480 destitute men and women and 90 children are being cared for in the poor house. 43. The Meshed telephone service which from being generally bad had lately become completely unuseable has been the subject of an official complaint to Tehran from the Governor General. The central authorities have now in structed the local director to have the service thoroughly inspected and to re port to Tehran. While this may bring some slight improvement it is unlikely that any general amelioration will be achieved in view of the poor construction of the local installation and of the general inefficiency of the lines men.

He was accomprinied by the sister of the Russian wife of Amir-i- Lashkar Amanullah Mirza who was on her way to take up an appointment as headmistress of the girls’ school at Bir jand. Her salary is to be 80 tomans a month. 41.

Jam has let it be known that he received a report of the posting of notices in a Sikh shop in Birjand to°the effect that if Bhagat Singh were put to death by the British Government 100 Englishmen should be killed in retalia tion. The Governor General claims to h ive sent immediate orders by telegraph to have the notices removed and to have the offender put in prison if he displays any further anti-British tendencies. Russian Affairs. 45. The Governor General stated on February 4 that he had had no less than 67 refugees returned to Russia during the last 40 days. Some sort of di^ crimination must however be exercised because many others are being permitted to remain. Afghan Affairs. 46. Nil. Turkish Affairs. 47. The name of the new Turkish Consul is Ismail Hakki Bey and his last post was Lrumia. He is accompanied by an assistant Bahaiuddin Bey a :d an t2 &gt;y T— 1013 (C) F&amp;PD —16 3 - 1 — 23 interpreter Mohammed Husain. In spite of the fact that His Majesty’s Consul General is now doyen of the local con sular corps the Turk has not yet called at the Consulate General. On the other hand he has paid his official calls on the Governor General, the Sarhang Haj Khan and the Rais-i-Nazmieh. He has also visited his Russian colleague and received visits from the local Caucasian and Azarbaijani Turks communities. The appointment seems to have Leen made in reciprocity for the appointment of a Persian Consul to \ an a P t0 P 0S |}JJ? which it is understood the Turkish Government were very reluctant to apree. The local authorities fear that the new Consul will attempt to nitrigue with local Afghans and Persian Kurds and are consequently taking precautionaiy measures.

All local governors, in places where judicia 1 courts do not exist, are now au thorized to decide Sulhieh cases (see para graph 61 of Diary No. 4). If the Governors act honestly this step should both facilitate and expedite the ends of justice. As how ever governors’ salaries are invariably in arrear their positions insecure and only obtained after cash payment to higher authorities it is unlikely that Sulhieh cases will be entirely decided on their merits. The Ministry of J ustice hopes to keep down abuses by a threat to bring any governor charged with corrupt practices to Tehran for trial. 98. The Governor General has decided to hand over Wahabzada's salary (see para graph 78 of Diary No. 5) for the purposes of education in Azerbaijan. Both Jam and Wahabzada are Azerbaijanis. 99.

On the receipt of a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul at Zabul that Syed Modyof an employee of the Road Depart ment had, with the help of Amnieh, forced an entry into the rest house at Shusp, taken an inventory of the contents and given the caretaker orders to quit, a protest was lodged with the Governor Genera 1 . It was pointed out to Jam that according to the information available in the Consulate General the Persian Government had taken over lines of communication from the Telegraph Department but that no men tion seems to have been made of rest houses maintained by His Britannic Majesty's Consuls. Any question relating to transfer of rest houses should first be settled with the Legation in Tehran and then arranged through His Majesty’s Consul at Zabul who was the proper intermediary. Jam appears to deprecate the use of force but professed ignorance of the incident and said he would send for Ardebili, who happened to be in Meshed at the time and instruct him to restrain his subordinate.

According to a recent report the North of Afghanistan is quite quiet and Ibrahim Beg is hiding in the mountains between Maimana and Mazar-i-Sharif hav ing suffered two defeats at the hands of the Government forces. Turkish Affairs. 103. The Turkish Consul ceremoniously hoisted his flag on March 19th. The Governor General, the acting Amir-i-Lash- kar, Consular Representatives, heads of departments as well as a numerous general assembly were invited for the occasion. Ismail Haqqi Bey took more than three quarters of an hour to deliver a speech from the foot of his flag staff. As a speaker he showed to considerable advantage but scarcely held the attention of his listeners who found the weather too sultry to stand about in the open listening to a consul whose presence in Meshed they were unable to justify and whose enthusiasm for peace and religion and the fraternity of nations they found difficult to reconcile with the acts of his government. Haqqi Bey laid consi derable stress on the bounds of religion which on the basis of Qoran joined together the three neighbouring countries of Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan. He made a la boured reference to head wear the point of which seemed to be that their diversity from the European hat of Modern Turkey to the fez of Egypt, the Kulla Pehlevi of Persia and the unspecified coverings of Africa and Afghanistan only served to emphasise their fundamental unanimity on the precepts of the Qoran. He confessed himself honoured to be a Moslem. He said that the Khalif ate had been abolished because the holder of the title was a Turk and that the millions of Moslems of other nationalities could not be expected to accept a Turkish Khalif. After a reference to the progress achieved in Persia by Reza Shah Pahlevi he spoke of the reforms and reorganisation introduced into Afghanistan by Amanullah Khan. Under Nadir Shah he looked forward to a bright future for Afghanistan. Turkey only wished for peace, was on good terms with her northern neighbour, Russia, and with Iraq under the mandate of Great Britain. It only re mained for her to advance united in a com mon friendship and religion with Persia and Afghanistan. The Governor General re plied with commendable brevity welcom ing the opening of the Consulate and ex pressing the hope that the relations of the two countries would always remain friendly. 104. It need hardly be added that the Turk’s tirade was taken seriously by no one.

Instructions had been issued to the new director of the provincial Education Department (see paragraph 76 of Diary No. 5) to draw up the budget from the year 1310 by cutting down below the 1309 figure.

Conscription in the Bujnui’d district is reported to be finished and recruits have proceeded to Bujnurd. 50. Yava Reza Khan Qasjmlu formerly commandant of troops at Bujnurd has been appointed commander of the cavalry in Birjand and left for his new post on February 18. 51. On February 2 the acting Amir-i' Lashkar gave a dinner in celebration of the coup detat. Preparations were made for forty covers and invitations were confined to the military, the Governor- General, the heads of departments and a few town notabilities. Some slight dis location seems to have occurred as a number of guests wrote at the last moment regretting their inability to be present and the dinner seems to have proceeded with the original seating arrangement unchanged and the vacant spaces unfilled. The party is reported to have come an end very early. (b) General. 52. Khoras m’s Governor General has again been a centre of coversation. Rumours have been current first of his impending appointment to Tabriz a id then of his nomination as Persian Repre sentative in Rome. Jam himseif pleads lack of confirmation of either report. The acting Amir-i-Lashkar informed the Consul-General that Jam had applied for the Rome appointment but his applica tion had been refused. 53. It has been reported elsewhere that the Persian authorities are refusing to issue passports to intending pilgrims to Mecca. This is not the case in Meshed. On the other hand, and guided no doubt by the obvious determination .of the authorities to discourage this pilgrimage, applicants for passports more generally announce their intention of going to India rather than the Hejaz. 54. M. Everard, the Belgian Road Engineer who has been- kicking his heels in Meshed for some weeks has instruc tions to proceed to Sistan and prepare a report in connexion with the partition between Persia and Afghanistan of the Helmand waters. His departure on this mission which was delayed owing to some confusion as to the exact authority issue- ing the orders is likely to be subject to a further postponement as it is understood that M. Everard has been converted by the Government into a railway expert whose services are required immediately on the southern section of the railway. 55. It is reported that accommodation consisting of six rooms and garaging for two cars is to be provided by the Road Department at Kuchan, Shirwan, Bujnurd, Nishapur and Tnrbat-i-Haidari. These establishments are primarily for the employees of the Department when engaged on repairs in their vicinity but it is understood that if there is room and do other accommodation is available they may be used by ordiaary travellers. 56. Repairs are in progress on the lehran road between Nishapur and Sabzevar. 57. Some disparity is evident between the report on the road Meshed to the Caspian through Kuchan and Bujnurd given in paragraph 11 of Meshed Diary No. 1 of 1931 and that given on informa tion supplied b}' the Consular Agent at Astra bad in Resht Consular Diary No. 7 of 1930. According to the information, indeed the assurance*-, of all the reponsible officials in Meshed no restriction whatever is placed on the use of the road while according to the information available in Astrabad only military traffic is allowed. Final proof of either version is awaited. In the meantime it may be noted that when His Majesty’s Consul-General expressed his hope to proceed to Tehran via Kuchan he was first told verbally by the Governor General that the road was excellent and after a few days politely informed in a note which took an outlook noticeably more pessimistic than that of Mr. Everard that the route was quite2 impassable at the present time of the year. Can it be that as was the case with one of his predecessors the Persians suspect male volent propaganda among the Turcomans or it is that the road lived its brief day when the Shah passed over it last autumn ? 58. Communication with Kariz and Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam is reported to hav^e been impossible owing to snow. Mails have been carried by horse. 59. Municipality of Nishapur has drawn up the following scale of taxes 25 hrans psr Kharwar of sugar imported. 6 Krans per Kharwar of rice. 1 Kran per KhatWar of straw and wood. 2 Krans per Kharwar of wheat. 60. Four months arrears of salary have been paid to teachers in the schools of Khorasan. 61. A Sulhieh (a small court to hear cases where not more than four hundred tomans are concerned) has been estab lished at Bujnmd. 62. Two inspectors of the Ministry of Finance have arrived in Meshed to examine the provinc al finar.cul depart ment and have started with the opium Monopoly. 6S. From the 10th of February last the rates foreign telegrams were raised by fifty per cent. The charge for tele graphic avis de reception were increased from twelve to twenty krans. 64. Asadi. the Mutawalli Bashi of the Shrine has suggested that the crown, the sign of the royal court, should supersede the mark of the Lion and Sun which has hitherto appeared on Shrine docu ments. This proposal has been approved. 65. Iqtidar-ul-MuIk, Governor of Tabas, has been to Meshed on a visit. 66. Aeroplane fares to Tehran from Meshed have been increased from fifty- five to eighty tomans a head. British Affairs. mi. Russian Affairs. 67. Instructions have been received from Tehran that local departments should ha^e no future dealings with samoiloff the architect who figured, per haps unjustifiably, in the recent Aghabegoff revelations. 58. It is reported that the Soviet have recently organised a motor service con sisting of fifteen Ford cars for the con veyance of goods and passengers between Askabad and Hoodan (near Bajgiran). Afghan Affairs. Nil. Tuktsh Affairs. 69. Ismail Hakki Bey has now called and had his call returned. He is a man in the early forties whose consular career seems to have been limited to Persia. In spite however of 6 years in Tehran and some time in Urumia his grasp of the language is by no means secure. The Vice-Consul, who in spite of his Muslim name, looks like a successful young Jew, makes no claim to any know ledge of Persian. The Interpreter says he lived in Meshed as a teacher of Russian before securing his present post. He should repay a closer study. The Consul has rented the house of Koshansky one of the local traders who have become rich through trade with Russia. The house, which must surely be one of the cleanest in the kingdom and is quite well furnished, without doubt costs at least two hundred tomans a month. The Vice-Consul is trying to rent a house nearby and has approached one of the clerks of this Consulate who owns a suitable house. 70. Ismail Hakki Bey caused some astonishment locally by appearing at the Sunni mosque for Id prayers. He received the Caucasian .Turkish commu nity on the same day. Meanwhile he is extending his circle of acquaintances among Afghan merchants. C. C. J.

Everard the Belgian road engineer is to work on the north and not the south railway as was stated in paragraph 54 of diary No. 4. He states that the German Engineers of the northern roll- way are all leaving on No Ruz and are to be replaced by Belgian engineers. M. Everard’s place in Khorasan is to be filled by Herr Eckor, a Hungarian Sub ject, already employed in the road de partment of the province and authorita tively stated to be a capable engineer. 76. Mirza Hadi Khan Ashtari arrived in Meshed on March 9th to replace as Education Offic ^r for Khorasan Malik- zade who is being transferred in a similar capacity to Isfahan. 77. The local telegraph office gave notice that as from March 1st on which date the Indo-European Telegraph lines were taken over by the Persian autho- V rities preferential tariff rates for tele grams conveyed on Indo-European Telegraph Department lines would no longer be applicable and that ordinary rates would be charged. 78. Yunis Wahabzada one of the Meshed deputies in the Mejlis has offered his parliamentary pay of 300 tomans a month for a period of two years to the Governor-General to be used for charit able purposes in Meshed. British Affairs. Nil. Russian Affairs. 79.. The Soviet Consulate General or- ginised an evening entertainment on Mirch 5th for the benefit of the local Russian Club. Admission was by in vitation and the Governor General, the acting Amir-i-Lashkar and heads of departments were present and the local Bolshevik and Armenian colonies were strongly represented. Drinks were freely available and it is reported that consi derable quantities of champagne were consumed at one toman a glass. The General drunkenness disgusted the lead ing Persian officials. No member of the staff of foreign Consulates received an invitation. The net profit on the under taking is given as 540 tomans. 80. {Confidential ).—It is reported that the Bolsheviks have put into circulation locally anti-Shah propaganda in the form of pamphlets entitled “ Star of thejworld (The red star presumably, being intended). Raza Shah Pahlevi is stated to be shewn as a tool of the British and in support of this statement reference is made to the suppression of the General strike engineered in Moham- mera in 1929. His Imperial Majesty is further represented as the oppressor of the poor and he is credited with a for tune of 180,000,004 tomans in banks abroad. The pamphlets seem to be circulated through the Persian post and an endeavour will be made to obtain a specimen. Meanwhile it is known that one local departmental head has receiv ed a copy and is extremely anxious that the fact should not become known to ;U3E IN : SECRFTA ,, t ■r No oj 13:1 4GIF -27(C) F&amp;PD-15 131—25. 2 &lt; the authorities in general. He parted with his copy very quickly, presumably by handing it over to the Police. Afghan Affairs. 81. Abdur Rezaq Khan has been no- minated Afghan Consul-General in Meshed. He appears to have formerly been serving in a similar capacity in Tashkent. His wife is said to be the sister of the present King of Afghanistan. The part are reported to have had trouble at the frontier in connection with the import of their motor car and weapons (they entered by way of India) but the Governor-General states that immedi ately the matter was brought to his notice he sweep aside all difficulties ex cept in the matter of guns and secured that their journey should continue with- out interruption. Abdur Rezaq’s guns and rifles wUl be relieved if they are not suitable for military purposes. C. C. J.

The appointment ap pears to have been made rather on the strength of the Shahzada’s personal charm than because of outstanding pro fessional qualifications for the post. 3. Sarhang Ali Reza Khan has left Meshed to inspect the troops at Kuchan. 4. Officers left on January 10 for the conscription of recruits at Gunabad, Firdausi and Tabas. (b) General. 5. Snow of which the first and last fall of the season occurred on December 1 last fell heavily on January 6 to a depth of 12 inches. A rapid fall in temper ature followed but was not maintained more than 5 days. 6. The Tehran aeroplane arrived on January 8 instead of January G. 7. The leading local newspaper the “ Bahar ” which relies entinly on the Consulate wireless, set for his daily news has decided to suspend the publication of Reuter for a time. He now rehashes the wireless reports appearing in the “ Iran ” when copies of that newspaper arrive in Meshed from Tehran. Appar ently “ Bahar ” considers that by pub lishing news fiom this Consulate General it is in danger of being regarded as Pro- British. This attitude is probably large ly a reaction following the publication of the canards on the Russian situation referred to in paragraph 372 of Meshed diary No. 20, 1930. 8. It is understood that the Munici pality has received approval of its pro ject to build on the Bagh-i-Milli and the Arq Square. The Bagh-i-Milli lies on the Khiaban Pahlevi, opposite the Con sulate and is apparently destined to add more shops to the interminable frontages, for the greater part unoccupied, that have been provided under recently exe cuted road-planning schemes. The Arq Square houses an ornamental garden complete with band stand and it will be a great pity if these two plots, almost the only amenities of the city, disappear merely for the sake of a miserable hand ful of rentals. 9. Sarhang Mohammed Rafi Khan Nawai, Rais-i-Nazmieh, Khorasan (see paragraph 409 of diary No. 22) returned from Tehran on January 6. 10. The prisoners boused in the old basement of the Nazmieh on the Arq Square were transferred on January 8 to handsome new quarters in the Avenue Jam—so named by Khorasan’s Governor General after his estimable self. 11. The following is a report from a reliable source on the state of roads from Kuchan to tne Caspian :— “ If there be rains during the month of March the road from Kuchan to the Kirik village, which is at a distance of 7 farsakhs from Bujnurd towards the Turcoman country, is bad for travel as the road is dusty in some parts and the dust turns into mud daring the rainy season in the spring. After rainfall the road gets dry after 24 hours and becomes fit f r travel. The road from Kirik to Astarabad is good during all seasons of the year, d he width of the road in moun tainous parts of the country is yards. It leads from Bujnurd to the following peaces Kirik, Amend, Marava Teppe^ Chinaransu, Karim Ishan, Haji Obeh[ Gumbad-i-Kaboos, Pehlevi Bij ana Pul-i-Karasu. The road branches at Pul-i-Karasu: one branch goes to Asta rabad and the other to Bandar-i-Jaz The distance from Meshed to Bujnurd U 40 farsakhs which can be covered in one day by car or lorry during the good season of the year. The distance from Bujnurd to Gumbad-i-Kaboos is 50 farsakhs which can also be covered in one day. From Gumbad-i-Kaboos to Astarabad the dis tance is 15 farsakhs and to Baadar-i-Jaz it is 22 farsakhs. From Bujnurd to Gum bad-i-Kaboos the distance, which is 50 farsakhs, can be covered easily in one dav during the month of March but travellers should take th ejr food with them as no IND ENCLOSURE IN FOREIGN SECRETARY'S ,6Tt3f* iVO 35 MAR. 1331 S /TH19312 food is procurable on this part of the road The distance from Bahdar-i-Jaz to Sari is 14 farsakhs. There is no political restriction for travellers to use the said roads which are free to all.. The peace prevailing on these roads is most complete British Affairs. 12. Early in the month a circular was received from the Post Office stating that a special Postal Department was being created to assess and collect the additional charges due in respect of telegrams in which two or more words were incorrectly joined together and transmitted as one, and the revenue thus defrauded. As from its ambiguous wording the use of commercial codes micrht have been considered to fall under this ukase enquiry was made as to its exact intention. Assurances were then given that no objection was raised to the use of commercial codes and that the circular aimed at checking the practice of Jew merchants who sent as one word in the Latin character a transliteration of several joined persian or hebrew words. Russian Affairs. 13. It it announced that the Governor | General has received orders from Tehran to allow no more refugees to come in from Russia. This order was confirmed by the Military and the Amnieh and a report is already circulating of two Russians being chased back across the frontier by guards near Pul-i-Khatoon. Similar orders have been issued by Tehran in the past so perhaps it is imt to be expected that they will be j carried out with extreme faithfullness I in the present instance. 14. Reports have been received of attempts by the Russian Consul-General^ to “ vet ” films received for exhibition in the leading local cinema. The intention seems to be to ascertain in goo ime whether films to be shown publicly are open to objection from the Soviet stand point. This action appears to have been precipitated by the announcement ot the impending arrival of the film Michael Strogoff and it is credibly reported that an offer of 250 tomans was made, with every prospect of a larger sum being available if necessary, for the suppres sion of this particular film. It is under stood that cinema proprietors declined the offer and said that they were not in a position to refrain from showing the films sent to them under contract from Tehran. The version eventually shown was scrappy to the point of incohe- Afghan Affairs. 15. The report of the departure of Akhtar Mohammed Khan with the family of the Consul General (see para graph 4i2 of diary No. 22) was prema ture. Apparently Ghulam Ahmad Khan’s condition is now considered to be so hopeless that the idea of applying operative treatment has been abandoned and he is to return to Kabul. He will be joined there by Akhtar Mohammed Khan who left with the Consul-Generals family on January 11. Pending the appointment of a new Consul General the Consulate .General is in the charge of Mirza Masjidi Khan. C. C. J.

The Municipal Council has decided to pay twelve tomans monthly to the Military to ensure the firing of the noon gun and meanwhile to approach Tehran in an attempt to secure a ruling that the Military should defray the charges as was formerly the case. 21. It is understood that a Persian aviator is now flying the Tehran-Meshed plane. The service has been irregular of late and although for this winter flying conditions are probably largely to blame the employment of Persian aviators is unlikely to encourage passenger traffic— at least from among Europeans. 22. It is understood that the Financial Department in Tehran has ordered a re-inspection of the domains of Khorasan. As it is only two years since the last similar inspection was carried out land owners are disturbed as such inspections are a heavy charge on their revenues. 23. The pay of census office for the month of November has just been dis bursed. 24. Qavim-us-Saltaneh has come direct from the royal court to be Chief Accountant of the Shrine at a pay of Tomans 300 monthly. 25. Following complaints of the work ing there of the Sijil Ahwal department 2 inspectors have been sent to Birjand. 26.

Reports were received during the month to the effect that the Soviet Consulate General objected to the Governor General against the interrment of Russian refugees in the local (non- British) Christian Cemetery. Charge of this cemetery has perhaps curiously, remained in the hands of the Bolsheviks from those of their Imperial predecessors. This report caused considerable indigna tion in local white Russian circles and this Consulate General which is in charge, of Esthonian interests, made discreet enquiries into the truth of the matter. It appears that the trouble arose from the interrment of a refugee in the grave adjoining that of the lately deceased wife of the Russian Secretary (see para graph 4f&lt;r~br Diary No. 22 of 1930). The Bolsheviks strongly objected to the wording of inscriptions placed on the grave stone and went so far as to demand the removal of the body. The Governor General appears to have replied that the cemetery was the common property of all Christians in Meshed and to have refused to permit the grave to be re-opened. 29. M.

Five Afghans are reported to have stolen 200 sheep in the district of Khaf between Sangan and Niazabad and to have carried them off across the border. It is understood that this incident has been the subject of representation from the Persian to the Afghan Govern ment. 32. The Customs at Bakharz claim to have detected smugglers bringing dyes,_ carpets and a quantity of sugar int&lt; Persia from Afghanistan. 33. A report from the same place announces an unsuccessful attempt, by some person unknown, on the life of Ghulam Sarwar Khan stated to be editor of the newspaper “ Ittifagh-i-Islam ” in Herat. 34.

Count de Vassoigne, a young and amiable Frenchman, stayed a few days here. He is preparing the way (in a Buick car) for a Citroen expedition which hopes to cross Persia, Afghanistan and 1 the Pamirs in the spring and reach Pekin. In spite of reports of heavy snow ahe id de Vassoigne pushed on into Afghanistan hoping to reach Mazar-i Sharif where the last petrol dump for which he is responsi ble is to be placed. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company is helping in the fuel ar- 1 range ments. number of Afghan Merchants with aoods uncleared on this date were badly caught. 42. The Governor General has an nounced that 480 destitute men and women and 90 children are being cared for in the poor house. 43. The Meshed telephone service which from being generally bad had lately become completely unuseable has been the subject of an official complaint to Tehran from the Governor General. The central authorities have now in structed the local director to have the service thoroughly inspected and to re port to Tehran. While this may bring some slight improvement it is unlikely that any general amelioration will be achieved in view of the poor construction of the local installation and of the general inefficiency of the lines men.

He was accompanied by the sister of the Bussian wife of Amir-i- Lashkar Amanullah Mirza who was on her way to take up an appointment as headmistress of the girls’ school at Bir jand. Her salary is to be 80 tomans a month. 41.

Russian Affairs. 45. The Governor General stated on February 4 that he had had no less than 67 refugees returned to Russia during the last 40 days. Some sort of dis crimination must however be exercised because many others are being permitted to remain. Afghan Affairs. 46. Nil. Turkish Affairs. 47. The name of the new Turkish Consul is Ismail Hakki Bey and his last post was Urumia. He is accompanied by an assistant Bahaiuddm - Bey and an ENCLOSURE IN [ INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S S No 555 ! Letter2 interpreter Mohammed Husain. In spite of the fact that His Majesty’s Consul General is now doyen of the local con sular corps the Turk has not yet called at the Consulate General. On the other hand he has paid his official calls on the Governor General, the Sarhang Iraj Khan and the Rais-i-Nazmieh. He has also visited his Russian colleague and received visits from the local Caucasian and Azarbaijani Turks communities. The appointment seems to have been made in reciprocity for the appointment of a Persian Consul to \ an a proposal to which it is understood the Turkish Go vrernment were very reluctant to agree. The local authorities fear that the new Consul will attempt to intrigue with local Afghans and Persian Kurds and are consequently taking precautionary measures. Iraj Khan produces &lt;as a joke a declared intention to shoot any Kuchani Kurd who is seen talking to Hakki Bey. C. C. J.
