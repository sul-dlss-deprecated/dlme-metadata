The correspondence generally includes reports on the incident, and covers measures taken to render assistance, the submission of apologies to the Government of Saudi Arabia, and occasionally the issue of rewards for assistance given. It also includes the details of an expenses claim made by the Government of Saudi Arabia in January 1935 for assistance rendered in the search for three lost Indian pilots of the Bombay Flying Club in October 1934: see folios 70-86. It further includes some discussion relating to regulating private flights over Iraq in response to this incident, the results being the issue of new regulations which can be found on folios 47-48.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan, later Sir Reader William Bullard), HM Chargé d'Affaires at Jedda, HM Ambassador to Iraq (Sir Francis Humphrys), officials of the Air Ministry, and officials of the Foreign Office. There is also correspondence with officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Saudi Arabia. Most of the correspondence in the file does not directly involve the India Office; correspondence in the file has frequently been forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Aeroplanes–Forced landings</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Search and rescue operations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001fb#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001fb#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001fb#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001fb#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
