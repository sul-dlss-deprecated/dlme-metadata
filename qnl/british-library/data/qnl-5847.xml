I8tn April 1928. 4 ''ith regard to tne ' jihad ^ scare, I think *.ore ^aa tae first to mention it in nis telegram dated about JiVbruar^ 23 th (at that date I was in Baa rah wnere the file remained)giving tne information brought by the messengers of the Shaikh of Kuwait when they returned from Riyadh. ?ith them travelled Zaid ar Hibia the naan Wild* first gave us tne alarming information that the .-taibah were out of control and gathering for a large scale raid. He mentioned nothing about a '’jihad;' He had 'letter' 1 evidence than the messengers who had only stayed five days in Hiyadn and like aid ”foreigners'are more or less under surveillance. I ashed lore today about this and he said that as far as ne could remember the first mention of 'jihad' was by Shaikh Ahmad(the Sn.of Kuwait) when recounting to him what news the messengers nad brought, xhis I thinx is the origin. Shai^n nhmaa heard this astounding news about the Ateibah and ^„man collecting to join with the auitair and in explain- -ing to More useu tne word jihaa .which ii mied lately tegan it's travels along our cable lines. (It is interesting to note tnat tne messengers were especial- -iy and personally asked by ibn c aud if tuoy were entirely satisfied aoout tneir mounts and offereu to excnarg their own animals for swifter and fitter ones if they weeo not satisfied. He must nave Known that they xoiew what was afoot in and it seems extraordinary tnat ne should nave let tnem go and even hurried tnem on tneir t ourney unless he nimself was not averse to tne news becoming Anown. teven if he felt obliged to let tne messengers go ne could nave easily detained ai id ar aibia or sent him a any or t™o later witn centradictory informat ion.) Ve ougnt pex-najya to consider why ohniad used tne word jihad. He cannot i tninx nave oeen stin scared himself as the /arsnips nan arrived in x-uwait on the I'Jtn February and tne cars and p^nes nau ueen promdsed for tne I9thjtut did not arrive owing to tne warishan)Raid.) I snould thinx it was just a ilttie natural exaggeration and’ after all wnen tne four great nortncrn tribes were all reported to be gathering it was an almost admissible expression. Home time ago Ion Haua refused to see him on the exouse of insufficient time &lt;br inconvenience and tnere has been ail tnia trouble about the Customs barrier through Kuwait whicn nas left tnem not on ver;v friendly terms. I expect it amused nim quietly to say in effect 'Here is your friend Ibn Saud wnom you ail lixe so much leading a jihad against you' having persuaded himself that if it wag not the truth il was so near it that it made no difference. ceft to itself this wire would nave done little harm but we Anew now certain people for their own ends began to spread and exaggerate tne newg wnen it filtered tnrougn from Kuwait. Subsequently tney did their very best to Keep tne story alive and are even now not finished with it. according to Berry of Basrah ^ones told him ne got his information about tne jinai and tne letter published to tne tribes by Ibn Saud from a correpondent in whom ne had implicit faitn and who actually had tne document snown to him. xhis man ne would not name but saidhe livea in aobair. Berry went out there and found by luox tne very man.a* sluitlbion called ^bdullah al iatato&amp;i. h© is well- -known *iS a cracked-train young man in whom no trust whatever can fca put. He said he heard the news from Sultan iim itrahim al Ikiaib who was a friend of the Shaikh of i..uwait c.nd consequently ho tnought it must be correct. Sultan ibn Ibrahim al Ikiaib is a not very woaltny Garage-owner and co-director of the Zobair- Auweit taxi company. He had actually visited Zobair and been seen vitn ..bdull&amp;h Tatabai. He is a fairly pleasant person and I lelieve is actually looked upon by the Shaikh of Kuwait as rather reliable,without ^eing quite in the rank of a friend I have seen him quite often and naji conversations on many subjects with him ur.a. find aim a great believer in tue new rab world, a supporter of the belief that Iraq is making greit progress and firmly convinced tn^t ail the Ar^b civilised states' will Shortly forge aneaa. xnLa view is rather unusual in wnat is praolicaiiy a bedouin town. He denies absolutely* uhat ne toxd tno xataLai youtn anything about a Jihad. He suggests tnut a misba^e arose tnrougii confusion with tne weli-Knovn pro-nerifi budiman ibn Kelib who has been for some time in Kuwait, iloone nas ever heard c^ny more aoout tne letters issued by ion baud to the tribes, on passing tnrouga Zobair some tiire ago I ordered an agent to find out fnat more ne could from ^bdulxan al fatabai bur tne agent reported tnat tnet young man nkd become very ObstinaJe # as idiots wiil t and refused to talk, ^y offer of a large sum for tne proclamation to tne tribes nas trougnt no response,and tne agents say tney believe tnia to uuve been embroidery by tne v ourn lists and not mentioned originally'by iatabai. Pernaps b.S.O.lasran could get the true story as since the afJair ocoorred I have never been in Zobair myself for more tnun an nour when passing through on tne way sonewiere else, ine discovery of tne xatacai incident wjas related to me tv berry. ^ cones is also reported to have a source of information at fhaioah;I believe he told Berry this nimself.

Zaid ar ciibia toid me tne ataiban wanted to get tnere but I suppressed it,as my wire was qui^e exciting enoug ihe next time it appeared,as far as 1 know,was in a wire from «.ames when witn tne ours, ihey nad captured,in action in wnicn no nearly los. ais life,a prisoner from the ^utair.

(I saw none of Glubb's). f ih3 prisoner as ,&gt;ou ^now escaped and tne cars did n not return nere for some time. I never heard Basrah given as an objective by anyone else. Perhaps Zaid spread the rumour from Zobair but there is nothing to show that ho did and it did not 'catch on' as I did not get it ’’echoing' subse quently. My own idea is that it oame probably by tribal agents to thetne'palace in the orjin&amp;r^ t Just ua it dio to us and tnut they took diraotiy tne opposite action and worked it for ail it was worth. (iou might connect in your mind Sh.Ali Shuwairabat with aii this but he did not arrive here until karcg bth t so he waa too late to get the credit for starting tne ^ih^d.) ky own conclusion after all this,which I am,.afraid is vary long,is that Shaikh Ahmad as Sabbah of Kuwait started the story of a'yihad'and that the Sherif kept it going for all he was worth,ably asaisted(for what ends except his own noto -iety I dont ujiow)by kr „ones,tne journalist of Basrah,who picked up some garbled yarns,in Zobair,from perhaps the servants at £haibah,and from a olerk in the A.i.'s office at Basran,D /0 25 a. fief my D/u 2$ and your DD/o XO of 11/4/23.
