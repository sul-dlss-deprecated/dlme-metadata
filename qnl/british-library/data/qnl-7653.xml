IV O Li. I. REPORTS OF ADMINISTRATION FOR 1918 OF DIVISIONS AND DISTRICTS OF THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES IN MESOPOTAMIA.REPORTS OP ADMINISTRATION FOR 1918 OF DIVISIONS AND DISTRICTS OF THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES IN MESOPOTAMIA. SAMARRA DIVISION. ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1918. # 1. Tribal.--( 1 ) A diagrammatic sketch (Appendix A.) of the Qadha, showing the distribution of the tribes at the end of December 1918, and the district boundaries, is attached. The divisional boundary cuts through the lands of the ‘Ubaid. It might appear advisable at some future date to alter this boundary so as to include the whole of the ‘Ubaid in one division. The final occupation of Tikrit, followed by the cessation of the hostilities with its accompanying relaxation of blockade rules,' has brough t most of the tribes back into the places they favoured in pre-war days. (2) The ‘Ubaid were divided in their allegiance for the last year of the war. Several semi-nomadic sections were wandering between A1 ‘Aith and the ‘Adhaim, whilst the section under Mulla Naif, Ghawalbah, remained settled at Dojmaniyah (T.C. 116, A. 80, W. 4/6), where they carried on cultivation of shattati as well as saifi and shitwi with some baqarahs. Of the semi-nomadic sections, that under Mit‘ab gave practically no trouble. The other sections, under Shaikh Hamad al ‘Abdan of the Kubaishat and Ahmad al Muhaimid of the Albu Khushaim, were continually raiding and being counter- raided by the Sawamrah and some sections of the ‘Azzah, the latter being a Ba‘qubah Division tribe. Since the hot weather, arrangements were made on two occasions for the rounding up of these ‘Ubaid sections, but both had to be abandoned for military reasons. (3) The General Officer Commanding First Corps agreed to the suggestion that an aeroplane message should be dropped summoning— Shaikh Hamad al ‘Abdan (of the Kubaishat), Shaikh Ahmad al Muhaimid (of the Albu Khushaim), Shaikh Shuj‘ah (of the Albu ‘Alqah), Shaikh Jasim al ‘Awad (of the Albu Talhah), Shaikh Abdul Rahman Ahmad (of the Kubaib), Shaikh Farhan al ‘Abbar (of the Albu ‘Isa), to attend the Political Office, Samarra, within three days, and warning them of the serious consequences which would ensue if the summons was disregarded. Care was taken that full details of bombing and machine-gunning exploits of the Royal Air Force should reach the delinquents. On the 27th November the writer flew over the Arab camps concerned and dropped 16 copies of the “ summons to attend ” over various groups of Arabs Of these, some fell into water, the ‘Adhaim and Wadis, others fell amongst the ‘Azzah, whilst the remainder duly reached the addressees. As a result all the persons summoned came in, a majlis was arranged, and sanads were taken covering the return of 2,500 animals and the payment of Rs. 8,900/-. (4) The then hostile sections of the ‘Ubaid supplied a small number of horsemen to the Turks, and one party of 35 came down to raid our transport, which by the way, did not travel by the road where the raiders were. ’ ’ J The nett result of the raiding parties’ labours was 13 donkeys laden with melons and about Rs. 200/—, all stolen from travellers between Samarra and Daur a fine bag for three days’ efforts of 35 men. x IO 1162—1 I 796 500 10/19 A 2(13) Concerning other tribes in the Division there is nothing of importance to note, and, broadly speaking, they have behaved themselves. 2. Irrigation. —(1) The Dnjail Canal, the only irrigation canal in use in this Division, takes off the Tigris at Hulaij al Dhib, whence it flows with many branches through Balad and Sumaichah to about 6 miles below the latter town. According to Le Strange, the plain watered by this canal was the most fertile spot in the whole of ‘Iraq, containing in its area over 100 towns in the time of the Khalifs. . _ This year the Dujail ceased to flow on June 28th, and the Irrigation Department were immediately asked to survey it with a view to a more economical use of its waters during the next floods. In August, the District Irrigation Officer carried out a preliminary survey, when it was decided to deepen the bed of the canal. The District Irrigation Officer anticipates it will now flow for eight months of the year. . . . . . Coolie labour, supplied by the Fallahin of the area irrigated by the canal to the extent of 26,579 man days, was employed, and 3,791,584 cubic feet of earth was removed. , The task was a particularly heavy one as in some places the earth removed had to be lifted about 20 feet over the top of the canal banks. The clearance was finished on the 23rd December, and to complete the work the Irrigation Department are now arranging to erect a head regulator, which it is hoped will be in position shortly. (2) During 1919 it is hoped to deepen the Tarmiyah and Naif ah Canals and bring water into them for irrigation purposes. In considering these projected schemes the great question is : will the labour for cultivation be forthcoming ? The answer so far as the Naifah^ is concerned will be more readily arrived at after the majlis mentioned in Tribal, paragraph 6 , has been held. It is hoped that the Ubaid will supply a large proportion of the necessary fallahin. 3. Revenue. —Nearly all the land throughout the Division is miri land, and tapu is conspicuous by its absence. ^ The charad tax varies according to the fertility of the zirrah. A comparison of the revenue for 1917-1918 and 1918-1919 is given below Particulars. 1917-18. 1918-19. Rs. Rs. Land revenue - - 29,745 1,65,449 Tapu Waqf ; Miscellaneous and special, be., fish, 1,003 1,053 kodah, 6,687 31,844 wood, butchery, dates, and tobacco. Customs 1,640 4,033 Total 39,275 2,02,379 4 Agriculture. —(1) A good deal of agricultural activity was manifest during 1918 up to and including the fertile Al Hawi upstream of Samarra on the left bank of the Tigris, in spite of the fact that the Turks on their retirement damaged or destroyed several pumps and many baqarahs. Al Hawi is a strip of low-lying land of varying width, stretching from about 11 miles to 5 miles upstream of Samarra. “ Two pumps, one of 10J h.p. and the other 26 h.p., together with 47 baqarahs, supply the necessary water. In the hot w'eather the verdant green of its crops presents a very pleasant aspect as compared with the dust of Samarra and its immediate vicinity. (2) The Samarra right bank cultivation was somewhat hindered by the presence of camps along the river bank. ( 3 ) The horse-power of pumps in the Samarra Nahiyah is 114, including one brought down from Daur by sappers. The owner was quite pleased to get the opportunity of bringing it down, but doubtless will soon want to take it back to its original site now that he no longer fears damage by the Turks. It probably * 10 1162—1 A 3cost him a good deal of bakhshish to prevent its being broken up before the Turks left. (4) The Baqkrah in this Nahiyah number 350. ( 5 ) A Government farm is being established under the auspices of the Agricultural Directorate, and a pump set of 24 h.p., not included in the above number, is already installed. ( 6 ) (i) Balad Nahiyah, including Sumaichah, has the Dujail Canal; pumps aggregating 230 h.p. and 840 baqrahs. (ii) The crops of this Nahiyah were, as a whole, fair to good. Wheat grown from imported seed was not a success. (iii) There is a large number of gardens in Balad and Sumaichah which produce many tons of grapes, pomegranates, dates and limes, as well as a considerable quantity of apricots The grapes are mostly of the long, white variety, and are particularly good. The total weight of this latter fruit grown this year in Balad was 100 tons, and in Sumaichah 7 tons. A point worthy of note is that 300 acres of maize, grown under political arrangements on the Dujail lands, produced 66 tons of green corn hay, which was taken over for the Army by the local Purchase Officer. (7) Tikrit and Daur had no chance of doing anything in the agricultural direction until the season for shattati came round. Both towns then went to work with a will and produced many tons of melons and vegetables. It is estimated that 300 baqaras will be working in the Tikrit Nahiyah after the rains. ( 8 ) The shattati crops of Samarra and Tikrit Nahiyah were good, and the Arab lost no opportunity of cultivating these crops. (9) 1917-1918 season saw very little daim cultivation north of the Balad Nahiyah. Samirlis and the Sawamrah did little, owing to lack of seed, the presence of troops on daim lands, and the uncertainty of their position. The Arab a mile or two out in the desert was not at all sure that the British had come to stay, and had no intention of risking what little seed he had. More than once Arabs have said they knew quite well that, if the Turks returned and their daim crops were ready, they—the Turks—would take them; whilst, if they were unripe, the Turkish transport animals would feed off them. ( 10 ) The 1918-1919 daim season throughout the whole Division bids fair to be a good one. Many square miles have been sown and the rains have been favourable. (11) Both Samarra and Balad have an experimental farm, run by the Agricultural Directorate for demonstration purposes, and it is hoped the Arab Sarkal, and incidentally the Government, will benefit considerably from the results obtained. At present the experimental crops are Indian wheat, sugar beet, English swedes, lettuce, onions, radishes, mangel-wurzel, potatoes, and ground nuts. 5. Municipalities.— ( 1 ) Samarra, an ancient walled-in city dating back to before the time of the Kbalifs, situated on the left bank of the Tigris, some 80 miles above Baghdad, is now the political Headquarters of the Division. A large khan has been taken over and converted into Political Offices and billets, all of which are now in one building—a distinct advantage over the earlier arrangement when no less than five buildings, scattered about the citv, were used for the various offices, &amp;c., of the Department. ( 2 ) The inhabitants now number just under 4,000, and all of them appear to be cheery, and contented with British rule. It has been rumoured once or twice that the head of the Government of the Iraq will soon be an Arab. Each time this rumour has reached the city several Shaikhs and traders have expressed the hope that it is false. This is regarded as an index to the true state of the Samerlis’ minds. „ f ( 3 ) Rente f or offices and billets, which was withheld in 1917 on account of the n nendly attitude oi the townspeople, has been paid with effect from January 1918. (4) Street-lighting, with 27 small oil-lamps, has been introduced. Hid i 5 Lheme7« 1 !'“' gateS °VP city 9X6 an a PP re ciable distance from the river, and a scheme is being prepared for a water supply. By the courtesy of the FirstA 4 7 Corps, their Field Engineer is now making a preliminary survey, and on its completion the scheme will be submitted. ( 6 ) The golden dome of the mosque containing shrines of ‘Ali al Hadi has been repaired, and the beautifully-tiled mosque of Muhd. al Mahdi is in course of repair. Samerlis aver that various Turkish Qaimmaqams have taken money for these repairs and not carried out the work; whilst the British have already repaired one, and are repairing the other, out of the Waqf—another good point for the present rulers of the country. The clock of the golden-domed mosque has been repaired on two occasions, once by a British sergeant and once by a private. (7) The Kiliddar, Saiyid Hasan, is a Sunni, although the mosques are Shi‘ah. He is disliked by the great majority of Samerlis, and is said to be dishonest. It is a good thing that his influence is small. ( 8 ) Daur, which is administered from Samarra,is a small town of 1,028 inhabit ants, situated on the left bank of the Tigris almost half-way between Samarra and Tikrit. It has nothing of interest. (9) Balad and Sumaichah number respectively about 5,000 and 3,000 inhabit ants. The former is some 20 miles below Samarra, and the latter 28 miles. Both towns are on the right bank of the Tigris; both cover a small site; in both the streets are very narrow, and the inhabitants of both are purely agriculturists. (10) Tikrit was finally occupied by our troops in July 1918. It stands on the right bank of the Tigris, about 30 miles above Samarra. The river bank at this point is some 50 feet high, and the town stands on the slope of a ravine running down to the river’s edge, with its narrow streets at all angles. Before July there were few people about, nothing being bought or sold, and nothing but dirt and filth on every side. The town now is a busy scene at all times. The bazaar is well stocked, and a fair amount of local purchase work is going on. The writer saw it on several occasions before our final occupation, and the contrast is inconceivable. 6. Judicial. —The cases dealt with during the year under review include few of importance, and include convictions as follows :— Theft. Rifle Theft. Blockade Offence. Obtaining Money under False Pretences. Assault. 3 months. 6 months. i 6 months. 6 months. 3 months. 4 1 1 1 ! 1 1 The convicts, with one exception, were males. The theft of three rifles from an Indian regiment camp near Samarra was punished by a fine of Rs. 3,000/- (1,000 for each rifle). This admittedly was not an ideal arrangement; but, as neither the thieves nor their tribe could be ascertained, this fine appeared to be the only punishment possible. It was distributed over the tribes in the immediate neighbourhood of the camp. A fine of Rs. 1,000/- was ordered on a tribe for having purchased a British rifle, knowing it to be such. Two tribes were each fined Rs. 1,000/- for blockade offences. A raid made by the writer in April last resulted in the capture of some blockade-runners, the con fiscation of six camels, fourteen donkeys, and a quantity of foodstuffs and cloth. Two tribes were fined Rs. 3,000/- for harbouring this caravan, two-thirds in cash and one-third in sheep. On information sent from the Samarra Office to the Director of Blockade in October, sentences were passed on blockade-runners as follows :— 3 men to one year each, and a fine of Rs. 1,000/— each, 1 man to six months and a fine of Rs. 500/-, 3 men to three months, 1 man to one month, —all rigorous imprisonment. 7. Education. —At the beginning of 1918 very few educational facilities were available, beyond one or two poor attempts by unpaid Mullas.8 There is now a fairly well-run school at Samarra, Daur, Balad, Sumaichah and Tikrit, with a total daily attendance of 170 pupils. In these, one teacher each in Samarra, Balad, Tikrit and Daur is paid out of civil funds. Desks, forms, paper, pens and ink are all provided, and further progress is anticipated shortly. 8 . Medical and Sanitation.— ( 1 ) Samarra has had the reputation of being a clean city since 1917, when it was cleaned up under the supervision of the Seventh Division. It is kept clean now by a gang of Arab sweepers, working under a British sanitary orderly. An Indian sub-assistant surgeon and a dresser are resident in Samarra. The sub-assistant surgeon attends a daily average of 20 out-patients at the Civil Dispensary, which is well-stocked with drugs. (2) Tikrit also has a sub-assistant surgeon, a dresser, and a Civil Dispensary well-supplied with drugs. The town was filthy when the Assistant Political Officer first arrived; but, by strenuous efforts and the kind assistance of the Military, it is now in a much more sanitary condition. An experiment is shortly being tried in Tikrit with a view to persuading the inhabitants to use public latrines and abandon the use of cesspool latrines which exist in their houses. The writer has not much hope in the success of the experiment; apparently the best arrangement would be one whereby the existing cesspools were ventilated by high pipes. This might be tried at a later date. (3) Balad had a typhus epidemic in April which lasted 10 weeks. Immediate steps were taken to isolate the cases, the town was placed out of bounds for troops and the usual sanitary measures taken, with the result that the epidemic was stamped out. The sub-assistant surgeon and dresser from Samarra were temporarily sent to Balad during the epidemic. Much valuable assistance has been given by Military during the year, including the loan of British Medical Officers from time to time. 9. Police.— There is a Civil Police force in Samarra consisting of one Chaush and 25 Police. With the exception of one man, their behaviour throughout the year has been exemplary. It is proposed to ask authority to absorb them into the shabanah force, which will shortly require to be augmented, and to transfer their duties to the shabanah. They are well-trained and well-drilled. 10. Shabanah.— The shabanah distribution is as follows :— Towns. Arab Officer. N.C.s. Mounted Men. Infantry. Samarra - - — 2 ■ 17 Daur - - - — Balad - - - 1 4 37 Sumaichah - - — Tikrit - - - — 1 9 7 The force has been extremely useful in road-patrol and blockade preventive work. Since the hot weather considerable progress has been made in drill, and it is hoped soon to arrange musketry practice on an open range. r , K P r .?P° se( } to increase the strength and take over the guardina of the Baghdad-Baip Railway at an early date. 11 Labour. At the moment of writing this report, approximately 1 800 men are working m the Arab Labour Corps, whilst a large number have returned to their ordinary work, which m most eases is cultivation. The Muqadimah of Balad, and the Albu ‘Ali and Jubur of Tikrit are doim, useful transport work with their camels. ’ £ ( J ar y ie ^ s the Albu Tsa were readily brought forward to clear the Eighteenth Divisional dump, after almost all Army transport had gone forward on the last offensives. A number of Arab pilots for river craft have been supplied to the Militarv firm time to time. . A 1 jThe Arab Labour Corps in this Division is continually short of labour. Two reasons are suggested for this shortage. Firstly, the Arab’s love of freedom—he hates being confined in camps surrounded by barbed wire—and, secondly, the comparatively low rates of pay. The Labour Corps pays its coolies annas 12 per diem, plus rations. Whilst the coolie appreciates the rations, he does not consider them worth annas 14, which is the value placed on them by Supplies. He can purchase all he wants for four or five annas. The same man can earn a rupee and annas eight as a fallah at almost any time, whilst during some periods of 1918 as much as rupees two annas twelve was demanded by and paid to fallahin. The large number of Military, with the consequent big demand for produce, has created an abnormal demand for fallahin. Doubtless there will be a slight drop in wages when the Military strength is reduced. At the same time it must be borne in mind that the supply of labour is much reduced by casualties in the-field. Again, if ‘Iraq is to produce the enormous quantities 'of grain one hears rumours of, the demand for fallahin will not be reduced. The rate of wages, therefore, cannot be expected to drop appreciably. 12. Miscellaneous. —&lt;1) In June, A1 Amir Isma‘il, Shaikh of the Yazidis, came in from the Jabal Sinjar on a secret mission. For several days he said nothing of the real object of his journey; and when, eventually, he did so, he was transferred to Special Service Officer. During his conversation with the writer, he produced a Peterson pipe, engraved Siege of Kut al ‘Amarah, 1915-1916, E.W.,” which he said a Turkish N.C.O. had given him. (2) A subscription list was opened in Samarra in August last for the Red Cross Fund, and a sum of Rs. 1,270/- raised entirely from the local Arabs. 13. Flying Majlis. —(1) In July and November a majlis was arranged. The first took place at the house of Shaikh Ali al Husain al Kuraiyim of the Albu Tsa. On each occasion the writer flew there as a passenger and many matters were discussed, including grievances between tribes and the labour question, many coolies then being required for railway construction and supply work. Aeroplanes and their pilots also formed a subject for discussion. The Shaikhs and their relatives present were allowed to handle the machines, and expressed great surprise at discovering the bodv and struts of the machine were not made of iron or steel. (2) Various parts of the machines were explained, and it was pointed out that their pilots were friends of the Arabs. ( 3 ) One important object of the majlis in each case was to enable the' Shaikhs of the district to become acquainted with British pilots and their machines, and get the event talked about in the desert, so that if, in the then forthcoming operations, a forced landing was experienced, the Arab would bring information to our lines, instead of being alarmed and informing the Turks. It is interesting to note that, although forced landings have since occurred in this Division, neither pilots, observers, nor machines have been interfered with. ( 4 ) The last month of the year saw the revival, in earnest, of the pilgrimage to the Shrines of Imam ‘Ali al Hadi and Hasan al ‘Askari in Samarra. Some 5,000 pilgrims visited the city during the month. ^ Durinv the evening of the 12th, a party of 12 women pilgrims, with a few children, called at the house of the Rais Baladiyah and insisted on being conducted to the Political House to pay their salaams to the Hakim al Siyasi. The writer exchanged a few words with them, and they went away with many prayers for the welfare of the British and thanks for the justice of their rule. This is the first occasion since our occupation that Moslem women have voluntarily sought out a British officer. In the times of the Turks such an incident was of very rare occurrence. It is taken as a sign that the Arab is beginning to know' us, and with that knowledge a real liking for us is being born. 14. Staff and Personnel — A staff diagram is attached (Appendix B.). The Staff of- the British Officer in the Qadlia in January last consisted of the Political Officer, Capt. S. G. 0. Murray, C.I.E., with headquarters at Balad. The Town Commandant, Samarra (the writer), a Military Officer, also did certain Civil Departmental work.10 On the 29th March he was appointed Assistant Political Officer, Samarra, and in July the office of the Town Commandant was finally abolished. The Political Officer left for India on leave on 8 th June. The writer took over the Qadha on that date and is still Officiating Political Officer. In addition, the writer performed the duties of the Special Service Officer from June to August. Lieut. Guest, Blockade Officer, remaining at Balad as Officiating Assistant Political Officer until September, when he returned to Baghdad. Capt. A. Platts was appointed Assistant PolPical Officer, Tikrit, in August and remains in that capacity. Capt. B. H. Cates took over the office of the Assistant Political Officer, Balad, in September, and was transferred to Sharqat in December. Balad is now without an Assistant Political Officer. The administration of the Qadha has been greatly assisted by the whole-hearted endeavour of almost all the Staff, and this report would be incomplete without a word of appreciation to thafc Staff. Capt. A. Platts, the Assistant Political Officer, Tikrit, has most ably administered his Nahiyah since our occupation, including the difficult period when troops were fighting in his area. Corporal A. Welstenholme, the Head Clerk of the Samarra Office, has been invaluable, whilst Mahmud Effendi Nadim, the energetic Mudir of Balad and Sumaichah, has carried out his duties in a most able and praiseworthy manner.

Political.— The boundaries of the Division are as follows :— Along the crest of the Jabal Hamrin, N.W., nearly to the ‘Adhaim Gorge; thence a few miles short of and parallel to the ‘Adhaim, to the Tigris at Dojamah, along the Tigris to Daudiyah (exclusive) and parallel to the Mushriyah Canal through Imam Daud; south of Khan Bani Sa‘ad to the Diyalah River at Safwah; thence a line N.E. to the ‘Aziziyah border; thence N. on a straight line passing midway between Balad Ruz and Mandali to the Jabal Hamrin. The P.O.’s Headquarters are at Ba‘qubab. The Division is divided into four districts, with A.P.O.s at Ba‘qubah, Shahraban, Dali Abbas and Daltawah. The Division is divided roughly, North and South, by the Diyalah River. ^ Owing to the abolition of the post of A.P.O., Dali ‘Abbas, the boundaries of the districts were changed in June; but as the presence of British troops in Dali ‘Abbas required an A.P.O. on the spot, it was found necessary to re-post an A.P.O. there, and the Division was again divided into the following districts :— {a) Ba‘qubah, the tails of the Mahrut and Khurasan Canals. ( 6 ) Shahraban. The area watered by the Ruz, Haruniyah, Shahraban. Sinsil and Hambis Canals and the heads of the Mahrut and Khurasan Canals. These latter include the Waqf and Tapu portions of the Mahrut Canal and the large Qadiriyah Waqf property on the Khurasan.14 (c) Dali ‘Abbas. The area watered by the Mansuriyah, the Shirwin and the Khalis Canals as far as the Khirr al Mujaddad. The district mclu es the large desert area, stretching towards the ‘Adhaim, over which t e ‘Azzah roam. {d) Daltawah. The whole of the tail of the large Khalis Canal, stretching from the Khirr al Mujaddad to within a few miles of Baghdad. The Waziriyah Canal in the extreme tail of the Khalis has been under Daltawah for revenue purposes, but the portion reserved for the Agricultural Department has been under the A.P.O., Baghdad. Population .—From the pure nomad to the townsmen, almost every grade is represented. The chief tribes are the ‘Azzah (Shaikh, Habib al Hazran), whose “ dirah ” stretches from the Khalis at Dali ‘Abbas to beyond the ‘Adhaim. Members of the tribes are found all over the Division, in scattered groups, working .as fallahs, but in the main they are unsettled. They cultivate Daim land at ‘Ain Lailah, Khakachan, &amp;c. The Shammar Sayih (Shaikhs, Midhri and Dulaiyan) were for a time on the Mahrut and Ruz Canals and the Ab-i-Naft River. They are pure nomad, following the pasture and do no cultivation. Some of the Bani Tamim have settlements on the ‘Azzah, a large distributary of the Mahrut, but most of this tribe live on the tails of the Haruniyah and upper Ruz Canals (Shaikh, Hamid al Hasan). On the middle Mahrut are the Karkhiyah (Sh., ‘Abdul Karim) and below them Sukuk (Sh., Hassuni ibn Muhd). Round Balad Ruz are some six or more tribes, Dahlaqiyah (Sh., Shatab), ‘Atbah (Sh., Majid al Hindi). Daiyniyah (Sh., ‘Abbub), Shammar (Sa‘id al Alwan), Shubailat (Muhd. al ‘Atrus). The lower Khurasan below Ba‘qubah is settled by the Mujamma 4 (Sh., Salih al Hindi). From Khan Bani Sa‘ad South the cultivators are mainly Albu ‘Amir, with a sprinkling of Dnlaiyim (Sh., Ahmad al Sulaiman). The Shaikh of the Jubur has his headquarters on the Shirwin, near Dali ‘Abbas and his tribe spreads across the Diyalah to the Haruniyah Canal. Such are the main tribal outlines, but on the Khalis and Khurasan particularly, villages and small towns have sprung up, which have become the foci of local population, and have done much to break down the tribal organisation. The inhabitants are all settled, but in cases of crime they are apt to remember their tribal origin and appeal to tribal custom. The chief towns and villages on the right bank are Dali ‘Abbas (250), Mansuriyah (800), Tijdari Sarajik (1,500), Daltawah (3,000), Khan Bani Sa‘ad (200). On the left bank, Shahraban (4,000), Abu Saidah (2,000), Kharnabit (2,000), Huwaidir (1,000), Ba‘qubah (5,000), Shiftah (500), Buhriz (2,000); on the Ruz Canal Balad Ruz has a population of 2,000. With the exception of the ‘Azzah, the tribesmen are almost wholly cultivators and as such are on the verge of settling down into the life of village communities. A list of the tribes in the Division, with the names of the paramount Shaikh, is given in the Appendix, but it must be pointed out that the Shaikhs have very little influence, and that the tribesmen in most matters look to the Goverment A.P.O. and Mamur, and not to the Shaikh, as the person to whom complaint should be made. I regret this tendency, as it involves a much greater number of minor Government officials than would be otherwise necessary. In tribal matters the Government officials of the Division, even when complaints are made to them, as far as possible follow in their decisions tribal custom which is obtained by the appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators agreeable to both parties or b}^ a majlis of notable persons. c J The custom prevalent on the lower Tigris, of sending a complainant or defendant to swear to the correctness of his statement at a holy shrine, is only followed to a minor extent. ’ ^ The part of the Division on the left bank of the Diyalah has been on the whole, quiet throughout the year. A party of ‘Ubaid from Samarra Division raided the Bani Tamim in August and carried off 40 camels, of which 15 were subsequentlv returned by Mulla Naif. The Bani Tamim threatened reprisals; but A P Shahraban, had no difficulty in persuading Shaikh Hamid to leave the restitution in the hands of the Government. The Bani Tamim have not yet paid up the first instalment of their dues to the Sukuk, according to their agreement of October 1917, but they have paid the whole15 of the first instalment due to the Karkhiyah, and have also made restitution of sheep looted. The tribes settled in the tails of the Ruz, Mahrut, Khurasan and Khalis Canals have all behaved well, as have also the ‘Ambuqiyah in the middle Khalis. The only tribe that has given trouble is the ‘Azzah, who looted a few caravans journeying between Dali ‘Abbas and Kifri during the latter end of the hot weather. Shaikh Habib, of the Azzah, had to pa}^ a heavy fine for one of these robberies and Chai Khanab was visited by Capt. McCormick,' A.P.O., Dali ‘Abbas, accompanied by armoured cars. His successor, Capt. Lloyd, has also visited Chai Khanah, and, as a consequence, the behaviour of the ‘Azzah improved towards the end of the year. Shaikh Habib, the paramount Shaikh, has very little influence, but there appears to be no person who is willing and able to take his place. The Azzah and the ‘Ubaid from the West of the ‘Adhaim have a long-standing feud, and the Azzah blame the ‘Ubaid for part of the robberies which occurred on the Kifri road. It is hoped to arrange a meeting between the Shaikhs of the ‘Azzah and the Ubaid from Samarra and Kirkuk early in 1919 in order to arrange a settlement of their feud. An attempt was made in the spring of the year to arrange a Fasl agreement between the Azzah and the Jubur of the Dali ‘Abbas district, who have long standing disagreements, which were made worse by the anarchy prevailing in the year 1917. Several leading Shaikhs were called in as arbitrators; but the Jubur refused to accept their decision and appealed to the Political Officer to decide personally the questions between them and the ‘Azzah. The matter will be taken up early in 1919. In September, the Political Officer, Major Nalder, took representative Shaikhs of this Division to Baghdad, to meet the G.O.C.-in-Chief. It is extremely regrettable that Shaikh Ibrahim al Barghash of the Karkhiyah, who had been loyal to the British since the occupation of Ba‘qubah in March 1917, died of cholera the day after his arrival. He has been succeeded by his nephew, ‘Abdul Karim al Barghash. Another death was that of Shaikh ‘Adhab al Hindi of the small ‘Atbah section, near Balad Ruz. He was succeeded by Majid al Hindi. Among nomads who visited the Division were the Sayih section of the Shammar, who passed through on the way to the Tigris below Baghdad. A section subsequently returned and were camped for a time at the tail of the Mahrut and at Tall Tbarab, near the Ruz Canal. They caused a certain amount of complaints of damage to crops. The condition of the people was poor in the early part of the year, but, with the exception of the non-cultivating section of the'‘Azzah, was good after the harvest. The harvest was a great improvement on that of 1917, and the demand for labour for military works provided remunerative work for everyone. Prices were high until the date of the armistice with Turkey. After which, owing to the removal of trade restrictions, consequent on the abolition of the blockade, prices came down with a rush. The price of barley fell from Rs. 350/- to Rs. 225/- per ton. 2. Revenue.— (a) Land Revenue. — Land revenue is mainly derived from the Government share of the summer and winter crops, of which the latter are the most valuable. Summer crops are rice and maize, with certain other crops, such as cotton and sisamum, of minor importance. i The winter crops are barley and wheat, with some minor grains, such as hurtaman. The greater part of the land in the district is Tapu, from which, in areas watered by flow irrigation, Government receives a revenue of one-fifth. A large portion of land is non-revenue paying Waqf, and two large estates, namely, the tail of the Mahrut and the ‘Uthmaniyah, are Sanniyah and Miri. From both the Sanniyah and Miri land, Government receives a revenue of one-third of the produce. The Government share in areas watered by lift irrigation varies somewhat, but is usually one tenth. Government also takes one tenth on crops which are dependent on rain alone. Vegetables pay at the same rate as summer and winter crops, ascending as they are watered by flow or lift irrigation. Shawati or vegetable gardens grown on the banks left by the falling river, both in the Tigris and the Diyalah, used to pay a fixed assessment, but during the year were treated for16 revenue purposes the same as other land, and the right of collecting the Government revenue farmed, the total yield for the Division being Rs. 8,730/- (Ba qubab, Rs. 5,620/-; Daltawah, Rs. 3,110/-). During the year, owing to the needs of the Army, the Government share of the wheat and barley crops were collected in kind. The total receipts in kilos were Wheat. Barley. Kilos. Kilos.

Before the rice harvest was ripe, the Directorate of Local Resources wished to receive it in kind and orders were issued accordingly, but owing to heavy rain before the rice was stored and the consequent probability of dampness, it was decided that the cash equivalent of the rice should be taken. The Mahrut cultivators were, however, given the option of bringing their rice to the Local Purchase Officer if quite dry and free from dinan (a kind of millet which infests the rice). None of the cultivators availed himself of this option, so it is presumed that the conversion rates were reasonable. The conversion rates for summer crops were— Haifi. Afli.

This estimation would not have been hard on the cultivator had the basis of estimation, i.e., the report of the Mamur been correct. Mainly, however, owing to the extreme scarcity prevailing in the winter of 1917—18 and the consequent very high price of grain, the cultivators ate a considerable proportion of the seed grain issued to them by the Agricultural Development Scheme as well as eating grain which they would themselves normally have reserved for seed. In order to shield themselves from possible punishment for putting seed to improper use, they made false declarations to the Mamur. The consequence was that estimations based on the 11 to 1 rule proved to be very excessive and had to be reduced. The summer crops were estimated by trained estimators appointed by the Political Officer. When possible, the A.P.O. accompanied them while estimating. A.P.O., Dali ‘Abbas, complains that the year under report was bad from a revenue point of view as the exigencies of the Military situation required the con struction of defences in his area, which had to be maintained intact, and, though these defences were small in extent, they prevented large areas from being cultivated, and the removal of restrictions came too late to benefit either his winter or summer crops. His district, as well as Daltawah, suffered from the failure of the Khalis Canal in the summer months. There are a large number of bearing date-trees in the Division, paying a tax of 6 | annas per tree. The date-tree tax yielded during 1918— Rs. Left bank Diyalah ----- 39,240/10/6 Right bank Diyalah - - - - -50,816/10/6 In addition, a small revenue of Rs. 18,656/2/- was received from winter crops, such as hartaman and adas, in which the revenue was taken in cash and not in kind. (b) Tapu. —The Tapu Department started work in Ba‘qubah on 25th August. Tin numbers have been put on all houses and shops in Ba‘qubah town and landowners have been warned to get their tapu sanads registered immediately. The present registration is confined to house property and garden land. (c) Waqf. —Waqf property covers a large area on both banks of the Diyalah, and, when the effects of the war have passed over, it should bring in a very good revenue to the Waqf Department. The large Qadiriyah Waqf in the Khurasan Canal is managed by the Naqib of Ba‘qubah and not by the Waqf Department. The principal blocks of Waqf property are— (1) Qadiriyah Waqf, managed by the Naqib. (2) Qarnabit village and gardens, the revenue of which was left for one year to Mustafa Chalabi for Rs. 42,000/-. (3) Kashkin, which brought in a revenue of Rs. 32,000/-. A large amount of this estate had to be left uncultivated owing to Military defences. (4) Mansuriyah al Jabal. The revenue during the year was derived mainly from the date-tree tax, about Rs. 200/-, and out of the 1917-18 shitwi crop about 15 tons of barley was distributed as seed advances. In ordinary years this is a most profitable estate, but owing to Military restrictions it was left practically uncultivated. There have been two Mamurs of Waqf throughout the year working on the left and right bank Diyalah respectively, and reporting direct to the Political Officer. The revenue from the Waqf property managed by the Waqf Department in this Division during 1918-19 is estimated to be Rs. 162,543/- (Khurasan, Rs. 95,427/6/-; and Khalis, Rs. 67,115/10/-). (d) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues. —The Kodah tax was at the rate of :— Sheep and goats - Annas 8 per head. Camels ------ Rs. 1 „ Buffaloes ----- R g&gt; \ ^18 It yielded a total of Rs. 125,298/8/-, divided between districts as follows Ba‘qubah Daltawah Shahraban Dali ‘Abbas Rs. 34,535/- 8,650/- 41,616/- 30,470/- Rs. 1,15,271/- A.P.O., Daltawah, reports that the season was bad owing to bad grazing at the close of last and the earlier part of this year. From August onwards the sale of ‘Araq was confined to licensed vendors, anc licence fees at Rs. 20/- per month brought in a total of :— Rs.

Shahraban - - . _ _ ^jh Dali ‘Abbas - _ _ _ _ A small revenue, amounting to Rs. 131/- for the whole Division, was realised from a small licence fee for permission to carry shot guns for sporting purposes. (c) Customs. As Ba qubah is not a frontier Division, the Customs revenues are nil. (/) Compensation .—Troops have been camped in the Division throughout the year on both the right and left banks of the Diyalah. Claims for compensation, however, have mainly arisen in the 13th Divisional Area on the right bank Diyalah! both in the neighbourhood of Daltawah and Dali ‘Abbas. In Daltawah there was a permanent Board of Assessment, which assembled periodically. A.P.O., Daltawah. was one of the members of this Board. The most notable amounts awarded were £T2,600 to Rashid al Farraj, farmer of the Waqf lands at Kashkin, and Rs. 1,062/8/- to the Mutwalli of the Nahr Saiyid Mandalawi estate. The total amounts awarded in compensation in each district were Rs. a.

In March, the Irrigation Department took over control of ’th canals on the left bank of the Diyalah. In the late spring and early summer ther was a shortage of water in the Khurasan Canal, which caused great loss in the fn,i gardens Among fruit trees, apricots were the chief sufferers. Vegetable garden and early idhra crops were also seriously affected. It was only in July when dam was built across the Diyalah below the head of the Khurasan, that garde! owners obtained sufficient water for their needs 0 t .„ T 0n the l 'f ht b ;? nk PjyaMb the Irrigation Department did not take oontro till June. Beloie this date, canal clearances in the Waziriyah and Mansuriya]19 Canals hau been undertaken by the Political Department at a cost of Rs, 3,378/-. The mam work of the Irrigation Department has been the construction of a new w i ±0r ^ • ^ ia ^ s Canal in the Jabal Hamrin, in place of the old head at ‘Awaijah, which was in great danger of being completely destroyed by the Diyalah. The new works will be completed early in January and it is expected that the annual shortage of water, which has ruined the Khalis area in regard to summer crops of the Khalis District, will be obviated. The bed of the Khalis afc its head is above the level of water in the Diyalah at low water, and to raise the bed it has been customary to dam the Diyalah each June. This ensured a supply of water for a time, but the first flood washed awav the dam, and, on the subsidence of the Diyalah, the supplv ceased. The new head will ensure a continuous supply not only to the Khalis, but also to the Mansuriyah, whose existing head is being turned into a head for the Khalis, and also for the Shirwin, which was rapidly sharing the same fate as the Khalis in having its head washed away. The lands called ‘Asimi, watered by feeder canals west of the Khalis, have in a great measure ceased to be cultivated. It should soon be able to bring them back under cultivation. The ‘Awaijah Dam was built—for, it is hoped, the last time—in June, and it leaked badly in August. There was a great scarcity of water in June and again in^ August, owing to the leaking of the dam. The scarcity was seriously felt in the Waziriyah, Mushiriyah and ‘Uthmaniyah Canals. In September the Irrigation Department made an attempt to clear out the Tahwilah Canal between Hudaid and Hashimiyah, but had to abandon it owing to shortage of labour. It is hoped to get the work done in February of 1919. The total area under crops during the year, taking the fiddan as 15 acres, was :— Winter Crops — Left bank - - - _ _ 54,967 acres Right bank - . - . . 36,555 „ Summer Crops — Left bank - - - _ . 18,000 acres Right bank - - - - - In addition, about 10,000 acres of garden lands on left bank and 7,000 acres of garden land on the right bank, obtained their water from the canals. 4. Agriculture.—T he shitwi harvest of wheat and barley, although much better than 1917, was disappointing in its yield. This was probably due to insufficient sowing. The Agricultural Development Scheme advanced considerable amounts of seed, but the great scarcity existing at the beginning of the year lead to a considerable proportion of this, as well as the seed usually reserved by them for seed, being consumed by the cultivators as food for themselves and their animals. Moreover, the seed brought from India was late in arriving, and the wheat especially was of very inferior quality. The area under cultivation was also adversely affected by the demands for labour and by the throwing out of cultiva tion of large productive areas near Daltawah, Ba‘qubah, Dali ‘Abbas and Sarajik, owing to Military defensive works and camps. The division is, on the whole, a barley area, wheat being imported from Kirkuk and other districts to the north. The tail of the Khurasan is, however, reported to be a good wheat area, but, unfortunately, it was not possible to test it owing to lack of water—in part due to the railway authorities having provided an inadequate syphon for the Khurasan Canal to flow through between Ba‘qubah and Buhriz. The summer crops, especially rice and maize, were very poor. The early crop of maize and dukhn was eaten by locusts, and the later crop suffered from an insufficiency of water. The rice crop was bad, the rice being crowded out by a millet called dinan. Captain Webster, the agricultural officer, has discussed the causes and remedies for this in his note. I agree with him that a long time must elapse, and the education of the fallah be improved, before he can be persuaded to budge from his old methods. The small amount of cotton sown did well. The area was necessarily restricted, owing to the demand for corn. A few areas were reserved as grass farms, but the grass was not of good quality. This may have been due in part to the cutting being delayed till the grass had flowered. B 220 having passed without the necessary water being available, and to the presence of almost a whole division of troops in his district. The wheat and barley seed supplied by the Agricultural Department for the 1919 harvest was again late in arriving, but the armistice with Turkey, and consequen relaxation of restraints of trade, resulted in a large influx of grain into the Division, so that the cultivators were able to supply their own seed without the mterven ion of the Administration. The amount of land under cultivation in 1918 was as follows : I have taken a faddan, which is the Arab standard of measurement, as equal to 15 acres, and a baqrah as 12 acres for lift cultivation. This I found was about the correct average. Area under summer crop was as follows :— Ba‘qubah 8,850 acres Shahraban 8,094 ,, Dali ‘Abbas not available. Daltawah - „ Captain Webster, the Agricultural Circle Officer, has furnished me with the following note on the agriculture of the Division. This sums up the agricultural situation in the Division. Agriculture (by Captain Webster).—The District is a promising one from an agricultural point of view, being well irrigated by canals from the Diyalah River, which maintains a sufficient flow of water even in the summer months to supply the various canals; but, unfortunately, the lack of good head-works has prevented the water supply in the canals from being sufficient for the needs of agriculture. Steps are being taken to remedy this by building a new head to the Khalis Canal (right bank), and making a cut from the Mahrut Canal to the Khurasan Canal (left bank), thus making the good head-work of the former replace the present unsatisfactory arrangement at the head of the latter. The former work will be completed by early January 1919, and the latter, it is hoped, in time for the low water season of 1919. The main agricultural crop of the district is barley. About four times as much barley as wheat is grown, and, generally speaking, the former is of relatively higher quality. The greatest need of the District is pure line strains of seed. At present all the seed is hopelessly mixed in quality. Barley collected from the sack of the sower shows as many as five or six distinct varieties; and wheat is some what worse, containing hard, soft, red and white wheat, and an admixture of barley and wild oats to an extent of as much as 50 per cent. Pure Indian wheat is being grown with a view to issuing it as seed, but it is probable that more satisfactory results would be obtained by judicious selections from some of the better varieties of seed present in the ordinary country sample. This is, however, a lengthier process. Up to the present the Arab has not realised either the superiority of wheat as a crop to barley, or the importance of clean crops. The reason for this is that he has grown largely for internal consumption. If the country is to have any prosperity, a ready market must be found for excess production, and in the present state of the world’s market only first quality grain can hope to find a paying position. For the most part, soil conditions appear to be quite favourable to the growth of wheat, though lighter patches of the alluvium do occur, on w{iich wheat would probably never be a paying crop. Winter Crop. Wheat and Barley. Total. Dali ‘Abbas Daltawah Ba‘qubah Shahraban 22,134 acres 22,833 „ 8,118 „ 28,437 „The main limiting factor of wheat-growing appears to be the capital involved, owing to the higher prices of this grain. An increase of more than 30 per cent, in the number of faddans under cultivation is reported for the year 1918-19 as compared with 1917-18. The feddans are probably individually 20 per cent, larger than last year, so that an increase of about 50 per cent, is to be expected on the harvest 1919, as compared with harvest 1918. On the right bank, Diyalah, cultivators have been sowing on rain alone, pending the opening of the new head. On the whole the weather has proved unfavourable for this. An early rain fell, which, although beneficial in itself, unfortunately, caused floods, which broke the ‘Awaijah Dam, and since then rains have been poor and infrequent. As a result, much barley has been sown only to germinate and die. The opening of the new Khalis head will, however, ensure a plentiful supply of water in time to get the crop along, before the spring growth begins. Government seed has been supplied again in this District, but it was undoubtedly again too late to be of the maximum value. The cultivator cannot afford to stop his cultivation in order to bring up seed to his land. He has in November neither the time, the men, nor the animals. If Arabs are to purchase Government seed in quantity, it should be available on the spot not later than September. In any case, they would prefer to see the stuff at the time of ordering. The Karun wheat which was brought up was, on the whole, good, but that brought into this district was variable in quality and in no case approached the standard of the original sample. Pests .—Wheat and barley being under extensive cultivation are not subject to pests to any very great extent. Crows are more than a nuisance in the sowing season, and their activities are ably seconded by pigeons. Rust is prevalent amongst the wheat, and this may be one of the reasons for the popularity of barley as opposed to wheat. A seed dressing which would at one and the same time protect the wheat from rust and make it unpalatable to crows, would probably pay the cultivator even under the present extensive system of cultivation. The principal summer crops are rice, maize, juwar, cotton and millet. Rice was usually a poor crop this season. In the first place it was almost universally infested with dinan, an inferior, almost worthless, millet. As much as 90 per cent, of this was found in a so-called sample of rice, and of the remaining 10 per cent, about 5 per cent, was dirt. Many reasons are given for the presence of dinan, but the real reason is probably that it ripens shortly before the rice and many seeds fall out on to the ground. Here they lie dormant, until the ground is again under rice, even though one or two years may have elapsed, and then, under certain conditions, such as shortage of water, the millet crowds out the rice, rendering it an almost negligible part of the crop. Only by good cultivation and the screening of the seed can this weed be eliminated. If, a month before the rice planting, the land were well irrigated, the dinan would probably germinate and could be killed by a single ploughing, which would also be beneficial to the rice crop. Failing this, in the following year the land could be ploughed and the dinan cut before it seeded, and used as fodder. Under present conditions, however, it will be difficult to bring the Arab to perform this (to him) unnecessary and senseless work. Early in the year it was noticed that much of the rice in the district had failed to ear out properly. This was put down by the Arabs to unfavourable weather conditions at the time of harvest. Later on, the plant became weak and stringy at the nodes and, just before harvest, it lodged on the ground in many cases. Samples were sent to Baghdad and Basrah, and the disease has been temporarily associated with urfu and eelworm disease prevalent in India. No account of remedial measures is yet to hand, but it seems probable that no treatment, except a complete destruction of all rice straw, and resting the land from rice over a period of years, will give satisfactory results. Maize —Was also on the whole a poor crop. It suffered largely from a plague of locusts earlier in the year, and the later-sown crops were, on the whole, kept short of water. It would seem that the late-sown crops siatid a better chance of yielding well; but, up to now, the information is not definite^ A good deal of Indian maize22 was sown. On the whole, it was not a success; but the Arab was impressec v size of the plant and cob, and a good deal of it is being kept for see . In my opinion, his own variety, though inferior on all other points, resistant both to climatic conditions and to the herbivorous insect pcs s. Juwari —Looked well at one time, but was also damaged by locusts, which appeared to prefer it to maize. Cotton —Is poor as a variety, but appeared to do quite well. The bolls are small, however, and the staple short. Much coaid be done to improve the varie y sown, as good results, with Indian, American and Egyptian cottons, have 0011 obtained on the experimental cotton farm at Baghdad. Dukhn —Is a variety of millet which grows well and yields well, but is not of great economic value. . Other Saifi crops are mash and simsim, but little of these are grown. The lattei is a crop that might be encouraged, as the oil is very valuable and a ready market for production could always be found. Vegetables .—A great stimulus has been given to vegetable production by the presence of a ready market, due to the needs of the Army. L nfortunately, the market was of necessity indiscriminating, with the result that quantity and not quality has invariably determined the methods of the grower. Large quantities of mediocre vegetables have been produced, and a ready sale found for them. Attempts to introduce vegetables other than those normally grown in this country have been made, with some success. Unfortunately, the potatoes introduced last year were, for the most part, late varieties; whereas, the season for the vegetable being very short, early varieties are essential. However, some success was obtained by Arab cultivators, and many are desirous of repeating the experiment. Fruit —Is an important asset to the district. The centre of the fruit-growing is at Ba‘qubah and Huwaidir. In the months of August and September, the sun fruit—apples, pears, grapes, apricots, peaches, &amp;c.—suffered badly from lack of water, the Khurasan Canal being at that time very low indeed. Many trees died and much fruit was lost. The citrous fruits, being grown under more shade, survived and, with the re-building of the ‘Awaijah Dam and consequent increase of water, they came eventually to a very good crop. Generally speaking, the quality of the sun fruits is bad, whilst that of the citrous fruits is distinctly good. This is probably due to the fact that, whilst the former are often raised from seed, the latter are grafted or budded on to the stock of the sweet lime, and thus the quality is maintained. Grapes are, however, also good, and many of the varieties are excellent. The universal type of vine is the best vine, having its root in the irrigation ditch often as much as 20 or 30 yards away. The most skilled agricultural work of all is undoubtedly done in the fruit gardens, which are well kept and regularly dug and manured. Grafting, budding, pruning, the raising of stocks from seed and cutting, are all understood and well done. Being more intensive in nature, the garden cultivation is naturally more susceptible to pests, but it is surprising how few these appear to be. Those which caused most damage this year was the insect pest on dates and the figleaf-eating caterpillar. Both these attacks were directly traceable to the effects of the war, which caused scarcity of labour and consequent insufficient cleaning and digging of gardens. The date insect appeared to lay its eggs in the ovary of the flower at or about the time of fertilisation. After a short time, the date thus infected suffered arrested development and either died or fell off, and it was found that the lava had eaten its way out to pupate doubtless in the cracks of the tree or in the accumulation of rubbish round the crown' The disease has always been known, and it is certain that the large increase was due to numbers of date-trees being left uncleaned in the winter 1917-18. In the same way, it appears probable that the fig-eating caterpillar pupates in the ground or in cracks of garden walls, and again it was chiefly insufficient cleaning and digging that led to the increase. This year gardens are, on the whole beiiw well cleaned, dug and manured, so that a repetition on such a scale is not to be expected. The whole district is one of great possibilities from an agricultural point of view but it is doubtful whether these possibilities can even be realised under the present23 system. Everything is left to the fallah, who is, as a rule, unresourceful and ignorant. An absentee Tapu owner is ably seconded in his efforts to depress agricuiture by a Mallak, who, in many cases, appears only twice in the year once to issue the seed and a second time to collect his share of the crop. Altogether, the tax on the actual produce is far too high, for, by the time the Government, the Tapu owner and the Mallak have had then due, too little is left for the actual producer. Ihe system of division of crop is one which pays a premium on bad cultivation, for the tendency is always to overcharge those who, by their own efforts, have done well, and to undercharge those who have produced little. In addition to this, it is a system which does not make for progress, as the man who does understand his business has little say in the matter of how it shall be conducted and none at all in such essential matters as the selection of his own seed. The opening up of foreign markets will make all these points of infinitely more importance than they have been hitherto. 5. Municipalities. —There are five municipalities in the Division at Ba qubah, Daltawah, Shahraban, Baladruz and Dali ‘Abbas. The first three are possessed of sufficient revenues and keep up sanitary and other staffs, but Baladruz and Dali ‘Abbas are small and poor. .... The Ba‘qubah municipality had a revenue of Rs. 35,000/-, the principal receipts being from toll on Burmah Bridge, Rs. 9,000/-; Ice Factory, Rs. 10,408/-, and Flour Mill, Rs. 2,600/-. The same machine works both the Ice Factory and the Flour Mill. Unfortunately, it is now old, and broke down several times during the summer. We are fortunate in having a good mechanical engineer in Usta Mahamad, who started it going again in the minimum time, but it is probable the municipality will have to buy a new machine shortly. t p • In Julv a theatre was opened in Ba‘qubah, but was closed after six or seven weeks owing to complaints against the conduct of the actresses. The principal heads of expenditure are :— (1) Establishment:^— (a) Office, Rs. 5,070; (b) Ice lactory, Rs. 2,820, (c) Conservancy, Rs. 7,200. (2) Oil and accessories to Ice Factory, Rs. 6,000. The Rais Baladiyah of Ba‘qubah exercises municipal control over the town of Ba‘qubah and the villages of Buhriz, Shiftah, Huwaidir, Qarnabit, Sadah, Zuhra a, Nahr al Shaikh, Rayah, Dura Quraiyah, and Mansuriyah. _ He has been exercising his functions unassisted by any Council under the supervision of A.R.O., Ba qubali. It is hoped to start a Municipal Council early in the new year. ^ , Daltawah Municipality has an income of Rs. 16,500/- and an expenditure ol Rs. 10,000/-. A/ The chief sources of revenue were Sadiyah Bridge toll, Rs. il,60U/- and ferry tolls, which realised Rs. 2,500/-. . , , . rr ^ ‘ u In February, the Jews of Daltawah and Shahraban refused to take lurkish money as small change, and caused some dislocation in the Bazaar. -00/- sma change was supplied to A.P.O. by the Financial Assistant to the Civil Commissionei, and matters quicklv righted themselves. Shahraban municipality had a revenue of Rs. 14,311/- and expenditure of Rs. 8,245/-. Principal sources of revenue were from bridges and terries, The municipalities were all administered as well as could be expected under the circumstances. Sanitation leaves much to be desired, but it is lopec a &lt; ns will be gradually rectified. The habits of a nation cannot be altered m the course of a few months. . , After rain the roads are almost impassable. It is possible that a system ot drainage will improve this, but a complete cure cannot be effected except at an absolutely prohibitive cost. 6 . Judicial. —A Qadhi was first appointed in Ba w qiibah in 1917, but un il May 1918 he was the only judicial representative in the Division. In May, a our of First Instance was opened, Mr. Norton of the I.C.S. being appointed is President, with Saiyid Salih Effendi and Mulla Husain, the Qadhi, as members. The work performed by the Share 4 ah Court is shown in Appendix A. An independent Qadhi was also appointed for Shahraban. A Naib al Ja‘fariyah was appointed in July 1918 to hear Shiah cases arising in the district. From Daltawah all cases referring to Sunni law are referred to the B 4 .Ba c qubah Qadhi. Until the arrival of a Shi‘ah 'Alim in Daltawah, &gt; hi a i case were dealt with by Shaikh Habib, an extremely useful and willing nian, w 10 would take no salary. In September, a Shi‘ah ‘Alim was appointed to Shahra an. The receipts from the Civil Courts amounted to Rs. 17,000/— against an expenc i ture of Rs. 29,000/-. A statement of cases tried and Major Bros’s note are appenc e (Appendix B). . Magisterial powers have been exercised by the Judicial Officer, Political Omcer, and Assistant Political Officers. In addition, certain labour and Irrigation Officers have had certain limited powers in connection with offences relating to their departments. A.P.O.s tried all cases which could be adequately punished by a sentence not exceeding six months’ imprisonment. Cases needing longer sentences were referred to the Political Officer. The number of cases in the combined register of the Political Officer and Assistant Political Officers, Ba‘qubah, was 116. Sentences exceeding one year’s imprisonment were inflicted in the following cases:— (1) Husain ibn ‘Ali, sentenced to one year’s rigorous imprisonment on 28th January for robbery. (2) Mahdi ibn Salih ‘Azzain, three months and one year’s imprisonment for carrying a rifle contrary to proclamation and for wounding Saiyid Hasan of Ruhmani; sentenced on 19th February 1918. (3) Mahdi ibn Salih ‘Azzain, sentenced on 4th April to one year’s imprisonment for carrying a British rifle. (4) Ahmad al ‘Abdullah al ‘Ambuqi was sentenced to death and hanged on 28th May for murder. (5) Tufan ibn Hamad was sentenced to 18 months’ hard labour on 7th August for robbery and escaping from custody. ( 6 ) Ahmad al Salim and Wuhaiyib ibn ‘Abdul Wahab, warders in the Ba‘qubah jail, were sentenced to four years’ rigorous imprisonment on 20th July for conniving at the escape of a prisoner. (7) On 21 st August, Ya‘qub Sion was sentenced to one year’s rigorous imprisonment for theft. ( 8 ) Muhammad Hasan was sentenced to 18 months’ rigorous imprisonment on the 16th October for giving false information. (9) Saba‘ ibn Khumaiyis was sentenced to one year’s rigorous imprisonment on 28th October for breach of duty in allowing a prisoner to escape. (10) Jasim Muhammad was sentenced to one year’s rigorous imprisonment on 5th December 1918 for theft as a servant. 7. Education. —There are four schools in the Division—at Ba‘qubah, Shahraban, Baladruz, and Daltawah. Of these, the Ba‘qubah and Baladruz schools are housed in good buildings. The attendance at Ba‘qubah and Daltawah is fair, but that at Baladruz is so bad that it has been seriously considered whether it is worth while keeping it open. A suggestion to start a school at Rashidiyah was made by ‘Abdul Wahab Effendi, but inquiry showed that the attendance could not be sufficient to justify the opening. The expenditure on education during the year was about Rs. 5,500/ . 8. Medical and Sanitation.— The Civil Dispensary at Ba‘qubah continued to do good work throughout the year. Capt. Harris, R.A.M.C., was in charge for the greater part of the year, being succeeded in November by Capt. Anton, R.A.M.C. These officers had their Military duties to perform in addition to attending the Civil Dispensary. Mr. Riaz Ahmad took up the appointment of Assistant Surgeon in subordinate charge of the Dispensary and held it throughout the year. The average daily attendance at the Dispensary was 120. The common diseases are diseases of the eye, mostly caused by neglect of hygienic conditions A good deal of malaria has been noted, and a few cases of tuberculosis. Venereal disease is not widespread, only about one case per week being registered at the Dispensary. One or two surgical operations have been performed, but the Arab is still shy of submitting himself to the surgeon’s knife.25 An outbreak of cholera occurred at Mahrut, but was checked by attention to the water supply. The Medical Officer complains that a few unqualified practi tioners are doing more harm than good and states that several cases of total blindness have resulted from their unskilled treatment. This matter is being taken up. Dr. Riaz Ahmad gives weekly lectures on sanitation and allied subjects at the Ba‘qubah school, and it is hoped that these lectures will bear good fruit. In the spring, Ba’qubah was threatened with an outbreak of typhus owing to the arrival of destitute Kurds from beyond occupied territory. The danger was arrested by establishing a segregation camp a few miles outside Ba‘qubah, in which new arrivals were first disinfected and subsequently quarantined. At one time there were as many as 2,000 inmates, but with the advance of summer, the numbers dwindled and finally the remaining inmates, mainly orphans, were taken over by the refugee camp on the right bank of the Diyalah. In Shahraban and Dali ‘Abbas much valuable medical assistance was rendered to the people by officers of the field ambulances stationed there. Daltawah reports that in the early spring there was a considerable amount of low fever prevalent, and that in March and April, typh.us and typhoid carried off several people. The influenza plague reached the division in September. Vaccination has been carried out by women vaccinators. Two were appointed to the Division in February 1918, one to each bank of the Diyalah. The number of vaccinations performed during the year is : Khalis district, 500; and Khurasan district, 517. 9. Police. —Serious crime reported consisted of three murders, in which the alleged murderers were arrested and a few in which they evaded arrest, and of a number of cases of highway robbery. One of the murderers, who murdered a Saiyid who was a guest in his house, was hanged at Ba‘qubah on 29th May. In the other cases, Ibrahim al ‘Abdikah was accused of murdering the Mukhtar of Akrat, with whom he had a family feud, and Ahmad ibn Nahar was accused of murdering a shepherd boy in the Jabal Hamrin. Both ‘Abdikah and Ahmad al Nahr escaped from jail. The former took refuge in a garden at Qarnabit. A platoon of infantry was sent to capture him, but failed to penetrate the garden. He subsequently gathered some friends around him and shot two of the Shabanahs sent to capture him, an^ escaped to Arab tribesmen out of the Division. Other serious crime has been robberies on the high road to Persia and in the neighbourhood of Dali ‘Abbas. Some of the latter robberies were traced to the ‘Azzah tribe, which was heavily fined. Cases of cattle and sheep thieving have been frequent, and some cases of house-breaking have been detected. Police work in the division has been done by the Shabanahs, assisted by a Police Mudir stationed at Ba‘qubah. (a) Jail Administration .—The jail can accommodate 50 prisoners, the diet being as follows :— Flour - - - lbs. 1 per diem. Rice - - - i 4 &gt;&gt; Dates - - - 1 2 ” Ghee - - - - ozs. 1 Tamarind - - 1 2 » Salt - - - 1 4 &gt;&gt; Vegetables, fresh - - 8 „ Meat, without bone - ' 8 on Fridays. Clothing in store consists of 50 suits (summer), 50 suits (winter), and 50 caps. Health of the prisoners is good. Terms of imprisonment ranged from 7 days’ S.I. to 18 months’ R.I. Administrative staff consists of 1 Chaush, 6 warders and 1 B.O.R. Admissions and discharges of convicted prisoners :— Date. Admissions. Discharges. « Transferred to Baghdad.

Escapes. 6/8/18 to 31/12/18 106 102 2 i 2 10. Shabanah. —The first A.P.O. in charge Shabanah was appointed m May. He took a few of the former police and mounted messengers to Hillah for a shoii course of training and to see the organisation of the Hillah Shabanah. The nucleus of the Shabanah force, which on 31st December consisted of HO mounted and 104 foot, was the mounted messengers attached to the office of the Political Officer and the A.P.O.s, and the town police of Ba‘qubah town. In addition to police duty, the Shabanahs performed blockade duties till the abolition of the blockade posts on the conclusion of the armistice with Turkey. Capt. Pedder reports that Arab officers have been a difficulty, but this was only to be expected, as men fit for this job must have been either serving with the Turks or have been taken prisoner by us. Training has not progressed as well as it might owing to :— ( 1 ) Constant unexpected demands for Shabanahs for miscellaneous duties, such as escorts. ( 2 ) Shortage of Shabanahs, as numbers had to be dismissed as unlikely to become efficient. (3) Desire to meet demands of A.P.O.s in out-stations. (4) Sickness. The number of recruits of the dismounted force has been satisfactory, but for the mounted force disappointing. The shortage of mounted men is due to— (If Other attractive employments. (2) High price of grain and living. (3) Fear of heavy work for owners’ horses. The grain difficulty was partly overcome by a daily issue of 2|- kilos of Revenue barley at 3 annas per kilo Dismissals have been frequent owing to the poor material of the original nucleus force, but there has been only one desertion, although all men are required to sign on for one year’s service. Men are gradually learning discipline, but N.C.O.s are still afraid to exercise authority off the parade ground. At the beginning Shabanahs were careless in gnard duty and allowed one or two prisoners to escape. The heavy sentences meted out to the offenders have taught the remainder of the force a sense of their responsibility. A certain amount of petty extortion is prevalent, but this is only to be expected at present. The condition of the horses is good and the turnout of the men has much improved lately. Smartness and esprit de corps have been found to depend to a certain extent on local conditions of service and notably on the housino- accom modation. Accommodation is bad at Shahraban and Daltawah and very 5 soocl at Baladruz. The result is that the Shabanahs at Baladruz are the smartest in the Division. There is an excellent Shabanah Barracks at Shahraban, but' it is occupied at present as a military hospital. Headquarters barracks for the Shabanah will have to be built. At present they are housed in a khan, which has begun to collapse owdng to the recent heavy rain. • u ' Men are armed with the 1914 pattern British rifle and 50 rounds of ammunition wdiile another 50 rounds are kept in reserve for each man. A.P.O. suggests tin t a number of rounds per man be sanctioned for musketry training. Clothing is, on the whole, good and serviceable. 11. Labour.— The demand for labour continued throughout the year Labourers were needed both for military works, such as upkeep of roads, and forJ 27 irrigation works, which, although primarily taken up owing to military demands for more crops, are ultimately to the benefit of the people. Under the former category comes the Arab Labour Corps, which Captain Gibbs organised in Sindiyah and which, owing to his tactful handling, became so popular that it absorbed nearly two-thirds of the male population of Sadiyah, Sindiyah and Mansuriyah al Shatt. 200 men were also employed at one time on the upkeep of the Daltawah-Abu Khamsah road alone. Of works of public utility, the following are worthy of mention and each absorbed a large amount of labour :— ( 1 ) Renovation of the river banks on the Tigris (supplied from the villages of Khan Jadidah, Huwaish, Dukhalah, and Rashidiyah). (2) Rebuilding of the 4 Awaijah Dam. (3) New head for the Khalis Canal. (4) Cleaning the head of the Khurasan and damming the Diyalah so as to ensure a water supply in the Khurasan Canal. (5) Digging out and cleaning the bed of the Mahrut Canal. Of these, the new head for the Khalis Canal is the most important work of utility and it will, when completed, do away with the necessity of the 4 A waij ah Dam, which hitherto has been an annual charge. An Arab Labour Corps of 1,500 men was organised for the work on the new head of the Khalis. Although the work will be of inestimable benefit to the Khalis district, it was not at all popular with the fallah, who, in many cases, had to work on it far from home and consequently desertions were frequent. The last two works were of shorter duration and the villagers, who were interested in the works, supplemented the Government rate of pay to the labourers. In October, the Irrigation Department, attempted to clean out the Tahwilah Canal, but, owing to the scarcity of labour, due to large demands on it, this work had to be postponed. All labour, both skilled and unskilled, continued throughout the year to be under the control of the Director of Labour. It is a matter for satisfaction that the labourers of this Division, who, during pre-war days, were accustomed to attend to their crops for a few months and waste the rest of the year in idleness, allowed themselves to be occupied throughout the year, and met the .large demands made on them on account of military necessity. 12. Miscellaneous. —The appeal to the population on Empire Day for funds for the Red Cross realised a sum of Rs. 7,186/-. The news of the armistice with Turkey was received with signs of thankfulness on all sides, and the consequent removal of blockade and other restrictions was especially welcome. Under orders, from the Civil Commissioner, a Peace bonus, amounting to Rs. 22,455, was distributed among the Arab staff of the Division. 13 Establishment. —The ordinary establishment at the headquarters of a district has been an A.P.O. with a British and an Arabic clerk and 3 peons. He is assisted in his Revenue work by two or three Mamurs, each in charge of a Shu‘bah. Each Mamur has a clerk to assist him in his office and a warehousekeeper and staff to assist in the receiving of the Government share of the harvest. At the headquarters of the Division there were at the close of the year three clerks for general correspondence work, of whom one was a B.O.R., one translator and three clerks in the Accounts Branch. The Revenue side consisted of a Mai Mudir and three clerks. A British Officer, assistant to the Political Officer, commanded the Shabanah. He was assisted by two B.O.R.s and Sergt. Lock, a very capable and energetic man, was Dy. Superintendent of Jail. I was Political Officer from 1st January to 31st May, and then handed over to Capt. Bell on proceeding on leave to England. Capt. Bell acted till 30th June 1918. Mr. Nalder, of the Sudan Civil Service, held charge till his transfer to Zakho on 1st November and Capt. Bell again acted till I resumed charge on 23rd December. Capt. Bell has been Asst. Political Officer, Ba'qubah, from 29th January till the end of the year. Capt. Walker was A.P.O., Shahraban, from 1st January to 4th December and Captains Jardine and Wrigley and Lieut. Macdonald held charge of the present Daltawah area. The Dali ‘Abbas District was, in the earlier part ofi lI 11 f or tiinate in having frequent changes of A.P.O., and was for a time &amp; sorbed into the Daltawah District. Capt. Lloyd has, however, been in charge since 9th September. A P a ha r ^ ian ^ Capt. Pedder, commanding Shabanahs, and all the district ’ f° r their extremely capable work and especially Capt. G. F. St. J. Bell, W i ° r ^ W ° len g th y f er nas, held the office of Political Officer of the Division, in a 1 tT Political Officer of the Ba‘qubah District. it t rJi ^ oun( ^ ^ r - C- Bissell very useful, latterly as Accountant and formerly as Head Clerk; and I have again to thank my Mai Mudir, ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Effendi, for nis painstaking work and for his invaluable advice on all Revenue matters.

Political and Tribal.— Following on the occupation of Khaniqin, Major Soane was posted as Political Officer here in December 1917. The whole countryside had been ravaged by the Russians and the Turks. Food supplies in the district were very short, and starvation, especially in the town, was acute. At the time of our occupation, only about one-third of the population of the district still remained, the majority having fled to escape the oppression from which they were suffering. Our arrival was hailed with relief, and the population soon began to return. The prevailing distress was accentuated owing to the fact that the tribes in the northern part of the district, unaccustomed to any sort of control, were raiding the roads and preventing arrival of supplies of grain and sheep into the district. Disturbances, apart from those that might be considered as purely hostile demonstrations, became so frequent that Major Soane advocated the formation of a Kurdish levy. It was found that the Bajlan and Juran tribes had removed and destroyed a great part of the machinery of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Ohah Surkh oil wells. During January, relations with the Kurdish tribes on the frontiers of Persia, north of Khaniqin, continued to be unsatisfactory. The Sinjabis and the Guran, under the leadership of ‘Ali Akbar Khan Sinjabi, who maintained constant inter course with German agents, continued to prevent the passage of supplies to Khaniqin. The treatment meted out to the Kurds by the Russian Army of occupation in Khaniqin had a far-reaching effect, and placed in the hands of the Turks and German agents a weapon, of which they were quick to make use. This, combined with a lack of confidence as to our permanent intentions, hampered political work in every direction. In the latter part of January, negotiations were established with the Sinjabis, as the result of which they gave assurances that they would protect the frontier road, allowing no Germans or Turks to pass through their country, and that they would not furnish the enemy with supplies. At the end of January, distress was so acute that maize and barley were sellino’ at Rs. 2,000 a ton. The Persian Democrat, Sulaiman Mirza, was living with ‘Ali Akbar Khan, and was exercising a particular!}^ harmful influence. At the beginning of February, he was arrested by a British column from Khaniqin and sent to Baghdad. At the same time, German agents, accompanied by Turkish troops, were on the Quraitu River, 20 miles north of Khaniqin, and were buying up any supplies that came across the Persian border. There were several collisions between them and our Kurdish Irregulars. During February it was found that the Sinjabis were not keeping to the arrange ments made, but were daily supplying the Turks with food and committing acts°of brigandage in Occupied Territory close to Khaniqin. The arrest of Sulaiman Mirza resulted in the retirement of ‘Ali Akbar Khan to Hajilar, where he was intriguing with the German, von Drueffel, to get the Sinjabi and kindred tribes armed with rifles. In order to check the activities of von Drueffel and his agents, the posts at Qarah Bulaq and Kani Chaqul were bombed at the end of February. At the beginning of March, the Kalhurs, who were wintering in the area between Kani Masi and Makatu, attacked one of our survey parties. Our Kurdish Irregulars accompanied by cavalry, were despatched, and the Kalhurs were attacked and severely punished. The efforts of German agents with the Sinjabis became very active during March and resulted in a combined conference of the Sinjabis and Kalkhanis and other tribes, who were said to have agreed to take sides against the British. However, in April a great change came over the political horizon. Supported by a column of our troops, the Kalkhanis and Kalhurs attacked the Sinjabis and thoroughly looted them. ‘Ali Akbar Khan was wounded and fled. Events were also moving quickly in Khaniqin, as, a few days later, a column to which were attached the Kurdish Irregulars under Major Goldsmith moved out along the Sirwan River and cleared the country of Turks and Germans in the northern part of Khaniqin district and right bank of the Sirwan.33 Erfore the war the Turfcisli border with Persia met the Sirwan River near the mouth of the Quraitu River, but the boundary commission in 1914 added a large tract to the Khamqm district on the left bank of the Sirwan, which included the valleys of the Quraitu and the Ab-.-‘Abbassan; also the plain of Hurain and Shaikhan. The war broke out before the Turks had taken over this new tract. As a, result of the operations against the Sinjabis on the eastern border of Khamqm and those against tne Turks on the western, the country looked like settling i 0 ™’ t lG lea( ? 1I ? g shaikhs, most of whom had been in communication with Major boane, came into Khamqm. Major Goldsmith, Political Officer, was thus able to make an extended tour in the northern area, and visited all the principal shaikhs. It was on this tour that bhaikh Mahmud of Sulaimamyah sent his representative to meet the Political Officer, askmg to be authorised to act as representative of the British Government at bulaimamyah, pending our arrival there. qk •| A i,\ t r h t be g inning . ° f Ju , n . e a Tl letter was sent from the Civil Commissioner to Shaikh Mahmud, appointing him British representative in Sulaimaniyah and district and at the same time plans were set on foot to enlist Kurdish Levies in Khaniqin district to enable British officers to take up a force of Irregulars to the northern limits of the district and initiate the recruiting of levies in the neighbourhood of Halabja. it was hoped by this means to establish the position of Shaikh Mahmud and as long as Kirkuk was held by the British there was every indication that these plans would have been successful. Unfortunately an entire change came about in the military situation. Kirkuk was evacuated by the British and the Turks reoccupied Sulaimaniyah and Halabja and, at the same time,’ arrested Shaikh Mahmud and sent him to Kirkuk. About this time (end of June) ‘Ali Akbar Khan began to come into evidence again, and was with Muhammad Taqi Beg at Zarin. Our Kurdish Levies were on their way to Halabja, but m view of the changed situation withdrew to Maidan. The political situation had now become extremely awkward for the chiefs in the northern area, who had lately established friendly relations with us. 4 Ali Beg son of Mahmud Pasha, who had arranged to raise levies in Halabja, was ordered back by the Turks; and Uthman Beg, chief of the Sharafbaini, retired to the hills to avoid complications with either party. During July, the Turks moved out from Halabja and established outposts on both banks of the Sirwan, in the area lately occupied by us, and the tribes found themselves once more in their grip. The Kurdish Levies left Maidan and established headquarters at Haushquru, about 15 miles north of Khaniqin. For the next three months until the end of October the whole of Khaniqin district north of the Quraitu river was out of our control and tribes were worried by foraging parties of the enemy. The final change in the situation was sudden and dramatic. With the British advance on Kirkuk and Mosul the Turks withdrew hurriedly from this district, and within a few hours the country between the Quraitu, 20 miles north of Khaniqin’ and Halabja was finally and completely clear. The news of the armistice following on the retirement filled the tribes with a feeling of confidence that their troubles were finally over, and the chiefs began once more to come into Khaniqin. December has been an uneventful month from the tribal point of view. Anxious to benefit by the settled conditions, all their energies have been directed to securing the maximum amount of cultivation for the winter. The above is intended to describe the situation as it affected the tribes nominally in Khaniqin district, but really for the greater part of the year out of our effective control. The tribes are not numerous and the area is thinly populated. The most important is the Sharafbaini— Chief, ‘Uthman Beg ibn ‘Abdullah Beg * inhabits the plain of Hurain and Shaikhan, and the slopes of Bamu mountain. A good tribe and pro-British, and found themselves placed in difficult circumstances throughout the year. Sections of the powerful Talabani tribe under Sheikh Rauf ibn Jallal at Gura- shalah about the Quraitu River, and Shaikh Tahir ibn Shaikh Muhammad at Hajilar. Several representatives of the Barzanji (a powerful Sadah tribe, the chief of which is Shaikh Mahmud of Sulaimaniyah), among whom are Shaikh Muhammad * 10 1162—1 n34 ibn Shaikh Saiyid Sarkal, Shaikh Kamil ibn Shaikh Rahim, cultivating m the Hajilar area, the valley of the Ab-i-Khurkhan. , ^ . K Further north, at Shamiran, Muhammad Taqi Beg and Muhammad Beg San Ahmad, both of whom unsatisfactory and clearly identified with e ur s. Within the area under our control throughout the year the tribes, with tew exceptions, have given uniform satisfaction and rendered excellent service. it leading personality in the district is Mustafa Pasha Bajlan, whose sympa lies ave always been pro-British and whose influence extending throughout the province has always been directed in the interests of law and order. The chief tribal elements are:— (1) The Dilo, Chief Mahmud Beg, employed by us as head of irregular horse from his own tribe, and assisted by the younger members of the Dilo family, Ibrahim Beg, Karim Beg and Hasan Beg. (2) The Suramiri, chief Muhammad Beg, raised irregular horse tor the southern part of the District, similar to those of Mahmud Beg, and did a great deal towards bringing lands under cultivation again, and repopulating deserted villages. (3) Talabani, represented by ‘Abdul Wahab, son of Shaikh Hamid, chiefly on the Kifri side of the Diyalah, but cultivating some land in the District. ( 4 ) Bajlan sections, in Binkudrah under Wali Agha Bajlan, and Qadir Aghar Bajlan in the Quraitu area, who died in June 1918.35 Mandali District. !• Po^TiiCAL and Tribal. —Mandali was occupied at the end of September 191/, and so by the beginning of 1918 had begun to settle down to ordered conditions. With the occupation of Khaniqin at the end of 1917, Mandali was clear of the immediate influences of war, and continued to remain so. It lies off the beaten track, except as a route to Persia, and lately, owing to the unsettled state of affairs over the Persian border, has for the present almost ceased to occupy the position of a direct caravan route, most merchants preferring to bring their goods through Khaniqin owing to the advantages of a main high road in military occupation. Absence of proper roads from any quarter make it especially inaccessible in the winter months, except for animal transport. The tribal element is Arab, but the populations of the two towns, Mandali and Qazani, are mainly Turkish or Persian speaking. (a) Relations with the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh throughout the year have been unsatisfactory. Friction has arisen on several occasions owing to the fact that the Wali still pretends to lay claim to land which, according to the boundaries fixed by the Turco-Persian Boundary Commission, is definitely within occupied territory. Frequent cases occur where noted bad characters, guilty of crime in this district, cross over the border, and, living under the protection of the Wali, are enabled undisturbed to continue their depredations. Representations to the Wali meet with little or no response, and the last communication addressed to him by the Officiating Civil Commissioner (copy attached, Appendix No. 1 ) with reference to Mandali affairs, has up to the present remained unanswered. This letter shows clearly the difficulties under which this district is placed, and the feeling of insecurity which naturally prevails, especially in the season when the Walks tribesmen are accustomed to descend on this district for the winter grazing. (b) s.—Relations on the whole have been satisfactory. In the early part of the year a fight occurred between the Kuma Sang police and an armed caravan of the Quachi section of Kalhurs, who were smuggling goods across the border. Karim Gurda, the noted Kalhur robber, had estranged himself from the tribe and has been in Pusht-i-Kuh territory. He died in October. The Kalhurs, according to custom, came down in January and settled in the lower bills round Makatu, and mention has already been made of the punishment meted out to them on account of their attack on a survey party in that area. Sulaiman Khan, chief of the Kalhurs, was in Mandali in January on his way to visit the Civil Commissioner, and agreed to the levy of Kodah tax on the Kalhur sheep grazing in occupied territory. With the aid of two representatives appointed by him, this was collected. They withdrew to the hills in April. (c) With the exception of the Qarah ‘Aulus Kurds, the tribes in the Mandali district are Arabs. The Qarah ‘Aulus are settled in the area between Makatu and Mandali. In January they were reinforced by the addition of the Jarmawandi section, who for the previous two years, on account of a blood feud, had been living in the Saumar valley. Through the intervention of the A.P.O. Captain Hay this was settled, and the Jarmawandi enabled to return to the main body of the tribe. Kaka Khan is nominally chief of the Qarah ‘Aulus, but the tribe is a much, divided one, and he has little authority, except such as accrues to him through Government support. The Turks were in the habit of changing the chief every few months. In addition to being cultivators, the Qarah ‘Aulus have for many generations carried on solely the function of extracting and transporting the crude oil from the Mandali oil springs. With the support of the Government, Kaka Khan has kept the tribe in good order during the year, and not a single robbery or murder has occurred in the district under his control. Smuggling has been rife, and the Qarah ‘Aulus are suspected of carrying on a prosperous traffic to Persia in rifles, collected by Arabs from those abandoned by the Turks north of the Diyalah in the Kifri area. o 2{d) Nida Tribe .—Shaikh Furaiyih, one of the few tribal personalities in the District. The Nida are settled on the banks of the Naft River, and are owners of large flocks of camels. Chief cultivation, shitwi. Shaikh Furaiyih is getting old and his son, ‘Ulaiwi, now manages the tribe, and generally comes to Mandali to represent his father. Their behaviour during the year has been satisfactory. Furaiyih was one of the two shaikhs who represented this district at the G.O.C. in Chief’s Reception at Baghdad in September. (e) Sa'adah Tribe .—In the summer cultivating in the Nuqaiyib date gardens, and in the winter on Tahmayah lands at the tail of the Naft River. At the time of our occupation ‘Abdul ‘Aziz was shaikh of the tribe, but, as he was found unsatis factory both to Government and his tribe, he was replaced in favour of Hawi ibn Shabib. The tribe has not been entirely satisfactory and had to be heavily fined for repeated robberies on the Mandali-Qazani road. (/) Al Mu'alia. —Shaikh, Mahmud al Sacham. During the early part of the year the Mu‘alla were kept busy owing to the activities of the notorious ‘Ali Shimal, of the Kurdish section of Al Mu‘alla, who repeatedly descended from the hills to raid. Conditions were so bad that they were supplied with rifles by Government to defend themselves. This step was effective in stopping ‘Ali Shimal from farther outrages. (g) Al Hamad. —Shaikh, ‘Abdul Hasan, a leading personality in the District, and better educated than the majority of Arab shaikhs. His cousin, Rashid al ‘Abbas, is inclined to intrigue, with a view of supplanting ‘Abdul Hasan from the shaikhship. The tribe cultivates in the Tursaq area and behaviour has been satis factory. (h) Albu Jawari. —Shaikh, Mutlaq al Farman. Cultivate in Tahmayah lands in winter. Mutlaq has been advanced Rs. 1,500 to clear out a canal. The tribe is a small one, but own considerable flocks of camels, which have been working for Government transport. (i) In addition to the above there are numerous small sections, mainly off shoots of larger tribes, among whom may be mentioned the following :— Al Mas‘ud, Al Ma‘dan, Al Huraith, Bani ‘Uqbah, Albu Faraj, Al Maiyah, Al Ja‘far, ‘Awadil and Al Zargosh.37 Qizil Robat District. Political and Tribal —Like Khaniqin, the district had greatly suffered from the depredations of the Russians and Turks. At the beginning of the year there was little food to be found in the district and arrangements had to be made to ration the people. Recruiting for Labour Corps appears to have specially affected this district, and the total population, town and tribal, is not estimated now at more than 4,200. The result has been a large decrease in the area cultivated. The tribes in the district are as follows :— (а) Arab. —Rabkah, under Shaikh Jazza‘ al Haidar; ‘Asachrah, also of Rabkah origin, Shaikh Jamil ibn Khalaf; Bani Wais, under Shaikh ‘Abdul Waisi; Na‘im Sadah, Shaikhs Saiyid Nasif and Saiyid Mahmud; Jubur, Shaikh Farhan al ‘Anbar; Darawish, Shaikh Hasan ibn Sulaiman. (б) Kurd. —Zargosh, chiefs Sharaf ibn Khalaf and Kambar. At the beginning of the year the Rabkah and the Bani Wais gave a lot of trouble on the Khaniqin road, continually robbing caravans. They were punished by a force of Khaniqin Kurdish irregulars and dispersed. After a time they gathered again in Qizil Robat plain and again began robbing on the Mandali road. For this they were thoroughly raided on 26th January by the Kurdish irregulars, their headmen taken prisoners and a large part of their livestock confiscated. This caused them to migrate across the Jabal Hamrin. This lesson had a salutary effect on the district and no further trouble has ensued. The Nabm Sadah are owners of considerable flocks of camels, which have been employed for most of the year on Government transport. Early in April a party of Darwish arrived in the district from the Kurwiyah area, bringing about 90 bait. Majority are sheep grazers and camel owners^ The total shitwi cultivation in the district is under 200 faddans and the district could easily be run direct from Khaniqin, were it not for the fact that the presence of a very large number of troops stationed in the district gives rise daily to questions concerning water facilities, labour local supplies, which can only be arranged satisfactorily by a Political Officer on the spot. Hi r c 3 * IO 1162—138 DIVISIONAL REPORT.— KHANIQIN DIVISION. 1. Revenue : (a) Land Revenue .—With the exception of Mandali, where conditions have been more or less normal, the Division has been too much affected by the war to be expected to produce the proper revenue. Practically no winter crops were sown in 1917—1918 in Khaniqin or Qizil Robat, and the summer crops were also less than usual. Assessment of land revenue differs in the various districts. In Khaniqin and Qizil Robat the Government share is one-tenth of the total crop, and there are no cash assessments. In Mandali there is a fixed shitwi cash assessment on certain lands, varying, according to the quality of the land, from Rs. 12/8/- to Rs. 26/4/- per faddan. Other lands pay one-fifth of the total crop, with the addition of a tax of Rs. 3/2/— for every faddan cultivated. Summer crops and vegetables in Mandali pay one-fifth. On Tapu lands one-tenth is taken. Khaniqin has been distinctly unfortunate in its Revenue Staff. There has been a constant stream of incompetent officials discharged either for dishonesty or inefficiency. Estimation of crops presents many difficulties as the Staff are not yet trained to survey and measure the areas under cultivation. Attached (Appendix No. 2) are the details showing revenue in cash or kind for the year. Tax on dates is taken in Khaniqin and Qizil Robat at 5 annas per full bearing palm, and in Mandali at 5f annas. Vegetables and fruit pay one-fifth as revenue. {b) Except in Mandali, it has not yet been possible to organise a local Tapu Department. Existing records were all removed by the Turks. Reorganisation has started at Mandali and preparation of lists of house and garden property has been completed. There are very large areas of Tapu property in the Division. Between Khaniqin and the Quraitu River most of the land is Tapu, granted in the time of Midhat Pasha. This is likewise the case in Qizil Robat, where almost the whole district was divided into two estates by Midhat Pasha and sold. In Mandali, with the exception of the large date gardens and one small estate, all the land is Miri. (c) Waqf.—In Khaniqin the only Waqf property is the ‘Uqr, and is confined to four estates. It varies from one-twentieth to one-twenty-fifth of the crop after the deduction of the land revenue, and is allotted to two charities in Baghdad, namely, the Jisr-al-Mas‘udi and the Marjan Mosque. The estates on which ‘Uqr is taken are the Haji Qarah, Qolai, ‘Aliawah, and Khaniqin Muqata‘ah. In Qizil Robat there is no Waqf property, but ‘Uqr one-twenty-fifth is taken on the Qizil Robat estate and paid to Waqf at Baghdad. In Mandali the revenue of the Auqaf Department in Turkish times was consi derable, amounting in 1325 to £T930, the largest item being ‘Uqr on Miri lands. In addition to these official Waqfs, the land revenue on 15 faddans of Miri land in the Mandali Muqata‘ah used to be devoted as Waqf to various pious purposes. There are 55 gardens in Mandali on which one-fifth ‘Uqr is taken, and credited to general Auqaf. In addition there is the private Waqf of the Jum‘ah Mosque in Mandali; proceeds are derived from the Khalil garden and about a dozen shops. The present Mutawalli is Saiyid Zahir. On Dahalah, Tahmayah and Naft lands* ‘Uqr one-twentieth is taken. As Tahmayah and Naft lands have a fixed assessment ‘Uqr is taken in cash at rate of Rs. 6/4/- per faddan. This is on the shitwi. On Saifi, payment is taken in kind. (d) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues .—The following is a list of those current in the Division :— Kodah, tax on sheep, camels and buffaloes. Special grazing tax also for buffaloes in addition to kodah. Tax on wood and brushwood. Arab qozi root, found in small quantities in Khaniqin district, used for dyeing. Slaughter tax on all animals. Half proceeds to Revenue and half to Municipal funds.39 Licences for sale of tobacco. Tax on brick and lime kilns. Petition stamps. Liquor taxes, distilling and retail sale. Fuah, a vegetable dye, obtained in Mandali district. (e) —Establishments are maintained at Khaniqin, Mandali and Qizil Robat. Qizii Kobat not being a frontier town does not now require a Customs Omce, and tins is being abolished from the coming year, as there is now a Customs office at Kifri. It was opened at the beginning of the year, as it was found that small consignments of tobacco and, very occasionally, a few carpets were coming in from Kifri area without paying duty. The Staff, one mamur and one qolchi, has, however, not paid for itself. Khaniqin is the principal office, and on account of the greater safety for caravans along the main highway to and from Persia, has taken away much of the traffic that formerly went via Mandali through the Pusht-i-Kuh and Kalhur territory. The greater part of the goods going to and from Baghdad come through on duty paid passes and Khaniqin and Mandali act as checking stations. Attached (Appendix No. 3) are details of establishment and amount of dues taken on imports and exports at Khaniqin and Mandali for twelve months of the year to end of December 1918. Since the Armistice at the end of October, when trade restrictions with Persia were largely removed, a British Officer has been appointed as Collector of Customs to supervise work both at Khaniqin and Mandali. Prevention of smuggling is controlled by the shabanah posts stationed along the frontier and a special preventive staff is also employed by the Customs Officer. Cases of attempts at smuggling are fairly frequent at present, but will tend to decrease, as the shabanah and preventive staff are showing marked improvement in their work. The revival of the pilgrim and corpse traffic from Persia will make a considerable difference in the coming year to the work at Khaniqin, and in a smaller degree at Mandali. (/) Compensation. Following are details of amounts paid out in the Division as compensation to local inhabitants for damage or loss incurred owing to military or other causes :— (a) Khaniqin : Trees cut down by military - . _ Damage to crops - Demolition of house for new road in Khaniqin Miscellaneous - {h) Qizil Robat: Demolition of buildings for military requirements Damage to crops - (c) Mandali : Compensation to family of Jafur ibn Habib, shot by a Russian soldier - - - - Rs. as. 483 8 50 0 4,805 0 129 8 1,850 0 70 0 500 0 Total - - 7,888 0 2. Irrigation : Khaniqin. — The district is watered on the west by the Sirwan and the numerous canals which take out of it ; and on the east by numerous streams from the Persian hills; and, in the area of Khaniqin itself, by the Alwand, the main tributary of the Sirwan. North of the Quraitu River, in the Gurashala area, the country is too hilly for extensive cultivation. At Qal‘ah Tappah the country is more open and water supply plentiful. Hajillar, the valley of the Ab-i-Khurkhan, has great possibilities for increasing the area under cultivation, given settled conditions. Lfpto the present it has been too open to raids from the Persian border. The plains of Huwarain and Shaikhan in the valley of the Ab-i-‘Abbassan have likewise never been cultivated thoroughly, as the Sharafbaini residing therein have always been exposed to raids from Persian tribes on the east and from the Jaf on the right bank of the Sirwan on the west, C 440 Major Goldsmith, after a tour in this area, reported as follows : “ There seems to be plenty of cultivation in this valley, and I think it will be difficult to teach them anything about irrigation. The innumerable streams which pour out of the side of Bamu mountain are trailed round contours of hills and led about in a most scientific manner. Their rice fields are, in most cases, on the slope of a hill, the water running from one to the other. They use a plough foi the nee fields and the black soil is reported to be more fertile than anywhere else. 1 estimated that the amount of land that could be brought under cultivation in this valley to be about 8 miles long with an average width of 3 miles. ^ The valley of Harshal and Banibi is also very fertile, and has plenty of water. This area is about 2J miles wide and 3 to 4 miles long.” Below the Quraitu River the district is watered by the Sirwan and the Alwand, and the chief canals that take out of these rivers are the Binkudra, Khaniqin, Haji Qarah, ‘Aliawah, and Qolai canals. Water supply is constant and sufficient for the present winter and summer cultivation. Owing to previous unsettled conditions and disturbance of agriculture, it was found that the majority of canals were in a very bad state. Cultivators were scarce and too impoverished to hire labour. With the consent of the Revenue Board loans were given and the work of cleaning out all the canals was undertaken. Distribution of water is carried out fairly between the local farmers, and seldom gives rise to disputes. The Director of Agriculture paid a short visit here in October and inspected some of the summer crops on the ‘Aliawah Canal. It appeared then that there was not only a considerable wastage of water, but that the tendency was to over irrigate the maize to a harmful degree. Mandali .—The district depends for its irrigation on streams flowing from the Persian hills. There are, in addition, a few springs which support some of the date gardens. Water is plentiful in the winter, but in the summer the supply is largely cut off by Persian tribes in the hills, and the amount that reaches Mandali does not allow for much summer cultivation. The district is divided into three shu ‘bahs—Mandali, Qazani, and Tursaq. (a) Mandali relies on the Ab-i-Gangir and the Ab-i-Naft. As in the summer the water hardly suffices for the gardens, no summer crops are grown in this area. The question of the Gangir River was discussed by the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, and the decision arrived at, was that half the waters thereof should be allotted to inhabitants of Mandali and half to the Persian inhabitants of the Saumer Valley. It again formed the subject of discussion this year with the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, as it was found that the Saumer people, by growing rice, had seriously diminished the supply of water to Mandali. It will doubtless be the subject of discussion in the future, until some effective means are taken to regulate the division of supply. (b) Qazani depends for irrigation on the Ab-i-Gangir and the Kan-i-Shaikh, and the tract known as Dahalah is dependent on the lower portion of the Gangir. Conditions are similar to those in Mandali and very little saifi is grown. (c) Tursaq includes the lands watered by the Ab-i-Talkh and Ab-i-Tursaq. There are no large date gardens in this area, and consequently a certain amount of water is available for summer crops. Owing to the salty nature of the water the proportional yield of the winter crops is not so great as elsewhere in the district, but the quality of the wheat and barley is especially good, and the name Tursaq is noted in the markets. Major Lewis, District Irrigation Officer, Ba‘qubah, visited Mandali this year to inspect the Hizam water course and aqueduct. The aqueduct has been destroyed, and there are many points in favour of its being re-built. A large area of land has been thrown out of cultivation. As a war measure the reconstruction was con sidered too costly to be undertaken, the estimated cost being about Rs. 15,000. He also inspected the heads of the various canals that take of the Gangir below Kuma Sang, to consider the question of a dam or weir to raise the level of the water. Qizil Rabat .—With the exception of the Diyalah, there are no rivers in this area; two small canals, known as the Nahr Chabirand the Nahr Zawiyah, take out of the Diyalah and irrigate about 200 fiddans.41 The district is small, and at present suffering from lack of population. Loans were given this year for cleaning out the canals and expense partly debited to Government, as the increased supply of water was mainly required by troops in the vicinity. The distribution of water as between civil and military became a matter of arrangement, and on the whole worked smoothly, 3. Agriculture. —The Division is a series of uplands and valleys from the north down to Mandali, where it becomes a level plain. The valleys are intersected by ranges of hills, rising as they approach the Persian border to the height of moun tains. In the spring these ranges are covered with rich grass and afford excellent grazing. This year, owing to the early rain and warmer weather, the grass has already in December grown to an unprecedented height and thickness, and is already being cut and brought into the towns for sale. Water is supplied from various rivers and streams flowing from the hills, chief of which are the Sirwan, with its main tributary the Alwand, whilst lower down in Mandali there are the Naft, Gangir, Talkh, and Tursaq streams. In addition, springs are frequently met with. Rain is plentiful in the winter, and in Khaniqin district especially a large part of the winter crops are daim, or rain crops. In Mandali district the water supply in the summer is insufficient for any considerable saifi sowing. In the other parts of the Division the water supply is plentiful and practically no difficulty arises in its distribution. Owing to the unsettled state of the country in the beginning of the year, except in Mandali district, practically no winter grain has been sown. The First Revenue Officer visited Khaniqin in January, and arranged for seed wheat and barley to be sent up to Khaniqin, to be exhanged for seed maize locally if it arrived too late. With the exception of about six tons of barley, the grain sent was too late to sow and was exchanged for seed maize. Some of the best winter crops were obtained from land where the Russians in the previous year had turned their horses into the standing crops. Sowing for winter crops, wheat and barley, begins in October and finishes in January. There are two distinct sowings of summer crops, beginning February to April and again in August. Maize is the chief summer crop and the seed obtained from the first sowing is used for the August sowing. First ploughing for either summer or winter crops takes place early in the spring, and, in the case of irrigated land, the land is irrigated at the sowing season and then re-ploughed and sown. In the case of daim land, first ploughing takes place early in the spring; but, as the ground is more friable, sowing in the winter season takes place before the rain and simultaneously with the second ploughing. The other crops grown in the Division are hurtaman, millet (jawari), dukhn, cotton, sesame, and rice, all in small quantities only. Vegetables of every sort are grown, and do very well. Mandali is justly famous for its dates, and has about 300,000 date-trees, including some of the finest varieties. Oranges, limes and pomegranates are also to be had in abundance, and in Mandali a particularly fine plum is grown. At Khaniqin the fruit gardens were partially destroyed by the Russians and Turks, and cut down for firewood. There has been a big shortage of plough cattle in the Division. Some Indian plough cattle have been purchased, and a number imported from the Hai district. For the 1918-1919 winter crop, about 400 tons of wheat and barley have been imported from the Karun.and from Shahraban, to issue to cultivators as advances. Mandali district had sufficient grain from the previous revenue demand for re-issue as advances. In Khaniqin and the northern area of the Division, the daim crops, owing to the regular rain, are considered an absolutely safe crop, and the areas open to such cultivation are very large and far exceed the capabilities of the present sparse population. Fine grazing lands are available everywhere, and serve both for the local inhabitants and also for the nomadic Persian tribes, who bring their flocks down from the hills in the winter season and spend several months every year in our territory.7 42 An Officer of the Department of Agriculture has his headquarters at Khaniqin, and acts both as adviser to all military units in the Division, who grow crops and vegetables for military consumption, and also assists and advises local farmers in the provision of seed, implements, &amp;c. He has also instituted controlled farms and gardens, providing seed and cattle, and supervising throughout the working and sowing of the land. A quantity of maize seed from India was provided this year, but the result was asignal failure. It is attributed partly to bad seed and also to rather late sowing. The crop grew to a great height, but the cobs did not fertilise. An experiment was also made with South African maize grown side by side and under identical conditions to the local variety. The South African variety grows a much larger cob than the local, but the cobs are not so numerous. The two crops have been harvested on measured plots, but results of the experiment are not yet complete. Settled conditions and adequate provision of seed have enabled the Division to put the maximum possible under cultivation this winter. Attached (Appendix No, 4) is a statement showing estimated gross output of crops m the Division, &amp; 1 4. Municipalities : Khaniqin District .—It is usual for municipalities in ‘Iraq to start with a considerable deficit, but the Khaniqin municipality was probably unique in having a monthly deficit of Rs. 12 , 000 /-. I wo causes contributed to this—the state of starvation, necessitating a monthly expenditure of Rs. 6,000/- for the Poorhouse, and the state of the town which required a very large sanitation staff. /v ^ . 1LSUal mun i c ipal staff were engaged—clerical, watchmen and sanitary—and a Civil Dispensary and Hospital were opened. The most acute question to deal with was to feed the people and many deaths from starvation were occurring daily. J Major Soane imported wheat from Baghdad, rice from Balad Ruz, and dates from Ba qubah and Mandah, and put the town and villages on rations. He also opened the Poorhouse, m which a large number of Kurdish women and children were fed and housed. Indeed, at one time the numbers rose to over a thousand. n May an Orphanage was started for the children of parents who died from starvation or disease. By the beginning of May, owing to improvement of conditions in the district it was found possible to return many people to their homes. It is satisfactory to note that the numbers in the Poorhouse and Orphanage have been by the end of the year reduced to 70.

It is43 off the beaten track and, except for one period of a few weeks, no troops have been near it; and troops have not been billeted within its walls’ The municipality is considered to be self-supporting, but it does not in fact pay for its town police, the expenses of which are at present met out of general revenues. Mandali, unlike the majority of towns, has very few heads of income, the only items being the house tax, slaughter tax, and Maidaniyah. At the beginning of the year, the town was in the usual insanitary state generally found in this country; but the work of reform was taken in hand by Captain Hay, with the result that it would be difficult now to find a cleaner-looking town. There is a Rais Baladiyah, with clerical staff and the usual staff of town sweepers. A Majlis al Baladiyah, unpaid, has also been formed, but the members are not very active either in assistance or ideas for the promotion of local reforms. The principal inhabitants have kept very much aloof from public affairs, probably OAving to the fear that our occupation might be only temporary. The town and district has not suffered from lack of food, and there has been no such acute distress as has been met with in the rest of the Division. Public latrines, town lighting, and improvement of the streets are being constantly extended whenever funds permit. Qizil Robat. The toAvn is a small one of about 350 houses, and a population of 1,700. The most conspicuous buildings, Avith the exception of the mosque, are the khans designed to accommodate the pilgrims’ traffic from Persia to Karbala. Pilgrims were the main source of income to the inhabitants. On our occupation, a Rais Baladiyah, clerk and sanitary staff were engaged. The town was very empty at the beginning of the year, but soon began to fill up. The mtmicipality is not self-supporting. This is partly accounted for by the fact that the presence of so many troops in the vicinity and town itself makes the matter of sanitation doubly important, and expenses are accordingly high. There is a canal running through the town, without sufficient water to keep a proper flow. It becomes stagnant, and is then very obnoxious. Proposals have been set on foot to have it bricked throughout. The cost would be very heavy, and expert opinion is divided as to whether it would have the desired effect. Chiefly through the efforts of Corporal Ford, the Sanitary Corporal, the state of cleanliness in the town is good. Like Khaniqin, the town was damaged by the Russians and the Turks, and many of the buildings are partially destroyed. 5 5. Judicial. —For the first few months of the year while the Political Officer dealt with all criminal cases, it was arranged that the mufti formerly in the service of the Turks should deal with civil suits. In May the Senior Judicial Officer, Baghdad, paid a visit to Khaniqin and arranged to send from Baghdad a native Judge to institute a Peace Court, and hear all civil and commercial cases up to a value of £T50, except cases relating to agricultural lands. The Peace Court opened at the beginning of June and the work of the Court has been satisfactory throughout the year. Court fees are charged in accordance with the Civil Courts Fees Rules. At the request of the Political Officer, the Peace Judge also on occasions makes preliminary investigations into criminal cases. Until August there Avas no regular Mahkamah Shariah in Khaniqin and cases were dealt with by the old Mufti. It Avas found that he was too old for the work. A regular Court was instituted and a sunni Qadhi sent from Baghdad. In Mandali there is one Qadhi sent from Baghdad. He acts both as Qadhi and Judge of the Peace Court. The Courts opened in August. Previously justice had been in the hands of the ex-Turkish Mufti. Justice, if it can be called so, was practically being auctioned to the highest bidder. The Mufti was convicted and exiled to ‘Amarah. At Qizil Robat, one Haji ‘Abdul Qadir had been established as Qadhi for some years before our occupation. The work is considerable there, and as the people seemed satisfied with his decisions, he was asked to continue his work. He accepts no salary from Government.44 It is satisfactory to record that from their inception the Courts in the Division have earned the approval of all concerned and the Judges have given valuable assistance to Political Officers. A statement is attached (Appendix No. 5) showing cases dealt with during period under review. Proof of the popularity of the Courts and of the undoubted need of regular institutions is evinced by the fact that the number of suits increases month by month. 6 . Education.— (a) Owing to dearth in teachers and unwillingness to come as far from Baghdad, Mandali has been without a school until December. The long felt want has now been provided for and two teachers were supplied by the Board of Education. About 30 children are attending the school at present. Qazani, a town of 3,000 inhabitants, about 8 miles from Mandali, is also asking for a school. It has been frequently pointed out to the people that lack of teachers is due to the lack of initiative on their part in failing to persuade any candidates to go from the district to Baghdad to take a Teachers’ Course under the Department of Education. Uncertainty of war conditions has probably accounted for the failure. (b) Khaniqin up to the present has had no Government School owing to lack of teachers. There are two mullas in the town, to whom parents generally send their children. Arrangements are being made to open a school under Government supervision. (c) Qizil Robat .—-In March an attempt was made to open a school at Qizil Robat and a schoolmaster was sent from Baghdad. Up to the present it has not been successful, and the school is now closed until a suitable schoolmaster can be found. 7. Medical and Sanitation : Khaniqin. — A Civil Dispensary was opened in April. The crowds of starving people who filled the town at the beginning of the year resulted in a few cases of typhus, but typhoid and starvation combined was the cause of many of the deaths. In response to an appeal for extra medical assistance, an Armenian Medical Officer was sent early in May, and the 14th Division provided medicine and an outfit for a 25-bed hospital. Up till then the medical work had been carried out by military medical officers in addition to their ordinary duties. In May the number of cases of typhus began to increase seriously and measures were taken to clean, shave, and reclothe all the vagrants in the Poorhouse. Two more Armenian Medical Officers and a Pharmacist were sent to Khaniqin, and the epidemic of typhus was stamped out. The hospital was then in full swing, in addition to the dispensary. At the end of May a case of cholera occurred. During the next three months the state of affairs was normal until August, when the Jelu refugees began to pour in. A temporary hospital was opened for'them. With the exception of a few cases of small-pox, most of the illness was due to dysentery. In October a few cases of cholera occurred, but the disease did not become epidemic. In December the Civil Hospital was moved to more commodious quarters. The average number of patients in hospital in normal times is about 15 and the number of persons attending the dispensary daily above 20 . VVith the exception of the Jelu women, the persons entering the hospitals are all male. _ Now that peace conditions prevail it is much to be hoped that a British Medical Officer will be made permanently available for the Division. There is ample room for a medical officer with Asst. Surgeons at Khaniqin, Mandali and Qizil Robat Work would increase m proportion to the reputation established bv any doctor who arrived. The present position in the whole Division, although unavoidable on account of dearth of doctors, is not such as to attract patients to the hospitals and dispensaries. 1Sanitation m -he town is improving, but still leaves much to be desired. Prejudices ot the people have still to be overcome, and the town has still to be put into a decent state of repair before good results can be achieved. In the meantime public latrine accommodation is being extended and improved, and cleanliness in the bazaar and streets is being instilled into the inhabitants. Difficulties are largely increased owing to the floating population which continually passes through Khaniqin. ' Mandali. Such advantages as Mandali has gained by being isolated from the scenes of war have been modified by the fact that it has not been found possible to detach a qualified doctor for the benefit of the civil population. Mandali and Qazani number over 10,000 inhabitants, and the total population with the tribes is about 20,000. There is abundant work for a fully qualified doctor. There is in the town one hakim, Amin Effendi, who is a Cabuli, and was employed by the Baladiyah in Turkish times. He worked for a few months in the hospital at Baghdad since the Occupation, and was then sent back here. Some half dozen cases of typhus occurred in Mandali in March, but the disease did not become epidemic. Owing to bad water, Mandali is very unhealthy in autumn. This year especially fever and influenza have been prevalent. On 22 nd September a serious epidemic of cholera broke out, and by the end of the month 61 cases and 56 deaths had occurred. A segregation camp for the sick and the contacts was formed at once, and at the beginning of October the epidemic had died out. The total cases were 68 and deaths 56. On the outbreak, Capt Balkrishna, I.M.S., was sent there to superintend the necessary arrangements, and did everything that was required to cope with the epidemic. Town sanitation is outwardly excellent and the streets and the bazaar are kept clean. But the house sanitation, as is usual everywhere, leaves much to be desired. Public latrines are in use, but more are required. Only the very poor people use them and householders continue to use the private cesspit system. Mandali has no hospital, but only a dispensary, and improvement will not be effected until a qualified doctor is available. Qizil Robat .—A dispensary was opened at the beginning of April with a Sub-Asst. Surgeon in charge, and attendance soon reached 60 a day. Shortly afterwards a hospital was also started. In June fever was prevalent, and the hospital was crowded out. There was one case of typhus. In July Capt. Stock, I.M.S., malarial expert visited the town and examined about 100 children. Only one wdth malarial spleen was found. State of health throughout the year has been normal, and the town, by dint of constant effort, has been kept clean. Latterly admissions to hospital have been very few, but the dispensa^ is well attended. Hospital work will never become constant until a good surgeon is available who Can undertake major operations. 8. Police.— The police in the several towns in the Division are really municipal watchmen and their duties do not extend outside the towns. Crime in the towns is very rare, and mostly confined to petty thefts. Until the Blockade restrictions were removed the chief duty of the police was to prevent evasion of the Blockade. Under the stimulus of a reward for any goods captured they performed Blockade duties satisfactorily. For the proper performance of police duties in general they are not yet properly trained, and do not possess the required authority. It is a matter of great difficulty to find suitable men as Police Officers. At Mandali, Capt. Hay was able to arrange early morning parades for the police, most of whom had been gendarmes or soldiers, and they have now acquired quite a soldierly appearance. Up to the present one of the most important of police duties, namety, the guarding of the bazaar at night, has been taken off the shoulders of the police. The system in vogue is that known as the paswaniyab, whereby a group of men undertake the guarding of the bazaar for a monthly sum, on the understanding that they make good any loss that occurs. The system has the obvious defect, that men of any means will not undertake such work, and if. as sometimes happens,46 a- big theft takes place, the paswaniyah group have not got the means to make good the loss. One such case occurred this year at Mandali. The system has now been given up, and the police made directly responsible. 9. Shabanah : Khaniqin. —No regular shabanah force on the established lines has existed up to the present in this District, and it is only in the last month that an A.P.O., Shabanah, has been appointed to raise a force. In the early part of the year, when the Turks were occupying the greater part of the district and caravan raiding was a daily occurrence, Major Soane obtained sanction to raise a force of Kurdish irregulars working under their own chiefs. This force was about 200 strong and was under the command of four chiefs, Mahmud Beg Dilo, Muhammad Beg Suramiri, Ibrahim Beg Dilo and Qadir Agha Bajlan. In the meantime, in order to prevent internal disorder, Major Soane had practically disarmed the district. In addition to maintaining internal order and resisting raids from enemy territory, the irregulars were also required to maintain the blockade restrictions and prevent supplies from reaching the enemy. They remained until the beginning of May and did some very good work, notably so when, under Major Goldsmith, they were attached to Col. Underhill’s column for operations on the Sirwan River at the end of April. It was decided in May to disband them and to raise a new force of levies under the command of British officers. Recruiting for the levies then commenced, and the former irregulars showed a marked disinclination to re-enlist. Rumour that they would be sent on service out of the country soon spread, and only after they were assured that there was no such intention did a certain portion of them join up. The original intention was to raise levies in Khaniqin and then take them up to Halabja area to begin recruiting there. The Khaniqin contingent was eventually enlisted and moved up beyond Maidan m route for Halabja at the end of June. The sudden change in the military situation at this time established the fact that recruits would not be forthcoming as the Turks were occupying Halabja. The levies returned to Maidan, and later back to Khaniqin. Eventually thev established headquarters at Haushquru with an outpost at Maidan. The latter was rushed by the enemy in August and several of the levies were killed or wounded. lor the next few months conditions were normal. The levies were a mili tary organisation and it was proposed, under more settled conditions, that thev should be disbanded or absorbed into a permanent shabanah force under Political control. This came into effect at the end of November, and a shabanah force under the control of one officer for the Division is now being organised and equipped. The force is being recruited in co-operation with the chief tribal shaikhs. Mandali. Strength 75, stationed at four posts, three of which are on the Persian frontier, and one on the Mandali-Balad Ruz road. Owing to the unsettled state on the border, and the presence of Persian nomadic tribes m the winter season, the Mandali shabanah have not had an easy time this year. In addition to maintaining order along the border, they are also larvelv responsible for the prevention of smuggling and observance of blockade restrictions In January the Kuma Sang Post was attacked by a band of Kalhurs, and in the same month the Makatu Post encountered some of the same tribe and recovered some stolen animals and goods. At the end of the month the Kuma Sang police had a further affray with Kalhur smugglers. 1 During the early months the Mandali shabanah were particularly active in seizing caravans attempting to run the blockade, and practically put a stop to further attempts. ' In March a fight took place between the Khizils and the shabanah who were sent to help the Kodah mamur to carry out his work. This resulted in the Khizils being bombed by aeroplanes. ivmzns frequent^ May ’ ^ nomadic tribes returned to the hills, incidents became less In October the Tursakh police had an encounter with a band of the Pan kin who had been deputed by the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh to collect revenue on land n our territory. A&lt;W1U 111 On several occasions during the year the shabanah have succeeded in arresting rtU^^^hUpJ ltl Vt : eX ^ Pti0I 7 haV6 had factory reports throughout ShaCalf o“ he Div^on, 7 ^ f ° m Part ° f the fOTCe Under the A ^. i/e47 Qizil Robat.—Any police work in the early part of the year was done by the Khamqm irregulars, and later m the year the presence of so many troops in the area obviated the necessity of maintaining a force exclusively for the district. The few men en er amed were used mainly as mounted messengers for the A.P 0 and tor blockade duties. The majority have since been transferred to Khaniqin, to form part of the new force 10. Labour. A large amount of labour has been employed throughout the year in lamqin and Qizil Robat districts, the chief works under construction being— (a) Maintenance of the main highway to Persia; (b) C onstruction of the Baghdad Khaniqin Railway; • (c) Repairs to the stone bridge over the Alwand at Khaniqin • {d) Construction of road to oil wells at Naft Khanah, in addition to ordinary labour always required by militarv departments. Part of the above work has been done by organised Kurdish Labour Corps, recruited m this district and others. 1 The recruiting of labour corps has had a considerable effect on cultivation, especially m Qizil Robat district, where the demand for casual labour, as at Khaniqin has always been very large. M ’ Casual labour is generally unsatisfactory and more so when it has to be commandeered, and it is greatly to be hoped that with peace conditions this will no longer be necessary. i i, 1 * ^ CE i L i LANEOlJS -—( a ) Oil wells are found in the Division at Naft Khanah and Chian iSurkli. The Naft Khanah wells are at present worked by local methods. The crude oil is taken to Mandah and Khaniqin, and is there distilled in small refineries and the produce sold to the military and civil. At Khaniqin the refinery is under political supervision. At Naft Khanah a tax is collected by Government at the rate of Rs. 1 /- per 4-gallon tin of crude oil. The crude oil is used also by camel owners as a dressin°' for camel sores. ' n y At Chiah Surkh the wells were formerly worked by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In the course of the war the plant was largely destroyed. The wells are at present being leased to a Jew in Qasr-i-Shirin. At Pushta, in the northern part of Khaniqin district, oil is found and also coal. A sample of the coal has been sent to Baghdad for inspection. Arrangements are being made for the proper development of the Naft Khanah Wells.

One of the results of the Armistice, which w*as received with joy by all concerned, was the raising of the blockade. It gave rise throughout the year 'to bribery and exactions on the part of the local police, and much petty annoyance to the inhabitants and to the officers dealing with the numerous cases. Khaniqin, being still a frontier Division, for blockade purposes has an outer blockade line, maintained by shabanah. (d) Jail ,—Civil jails are maintained at Khaniqin and Mandali, but convicts sentenced to over six months’ imprisonment are generally transferred to Baghdad.48 Prisoners are employed to work on the roads, repairing municipal buildings or any other work of general use, which will give them labour and exercise. (e) Jelu Refugees .—Some 40,000 odd refugees have passed through Khaniqin and Qizil Robat. At each place a special camp was formed, and medical and supervising staff employed. Hospital accommodation was also provided. (f) Civil Post Offices and Telegraph Offices have not yet been opened in the Division, but will be in the near future. Facilities are given to local inhabitants to bring letters to the Political Offices for despatch to Baghdad. kum® the Armistice, mails from Persia have also been received at the Political Office, Khaniqin, for onward despatch to Baghdad. (g) One of the problems in this Division is the regular winter influx of beggars and destitute people from Persia and Kurdistan. Most of the villages have them and Khaniqin is full of them. Those from Persia are sent back to Qasr-i-Shirin, and A.P.O., Qasr-i-Shirin is taking steps to try and prevent their entry into Occupied Territory. Their entry into Khaniqin is most undesirable in the interests of sanitation and cleanliness. a , W Pilgrims. Pilgrim traffic from Persia to Karbala started after the Armistice.

Officiating Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. To Ghulam Riza Khan Amir Jang, Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh. After compliments, I take up my pen, firstly, that I may have the pleasure of renewing my correspondence with you, an honour which I greatly esteem, and, secondly, that I may bring to your notice certain matters concerning which the Assistant Political Officer, Mandali, has written to me. These matters are very unpleasant, and it is with great unwillingness that I approach them, yet I think you cannot be ignorant of them. Firstly, as regards Karim Gurda, it is not necessary that I should describe his crimes at length, » and indeed we have talked about them before. And the afore-mentioned officer acknowledges with thanks the sum of 25 liras sent as a compensation to his victims. But seeing that the afore mentioned robber carried off as many as 287 sheep from the inhabitants of Mandali, the above sum is hardly sufficient. Moreover, for many months Karim Gurda troubled the road between Mandali and Kirmanshah and prevented those that wished from bringing their flocks to the Menzil, and the whole time he was living in your territory, and you would not punish him, nor even cause him to cease from his acts. Secondly, as regards ‘ Ali Shimal, it is well known that last winter he settled in Neh Khidr, a tract which the Boundary Commission determined to belong to the Turkish Empire, and he made an attack on the tribe of the A1 Mu c alla. Then, when the aeroplane came, he fled to you and you gave him lands in Saifi, well knowing what an unspeakable scoundrel he is. After that he made three attacks on the afore-mentioned tribe and, in all, killed or carried off 11 horses, 4 cows, 10 donkeys and 7 sheep. And, finally, some of his followers killed a man of the ‘Bani’ Uqbah, a tribe with whom they had no quarrel. All this time you made no attempt to restrain ‘Ali Shimal, and he only attacked because he knew that the British Government had too much respect for your rights to endeavour to punish him when he was on your soil. And besides ‘Ali Shimal, you give protection to another worthless criminal, Yasin A1 Musa, from whom many things are owing. Thirdly, as regards the tribe of Khizils, who are your subjects. In the middle of the winter they began to rob travellers on the road between Mandali and Badrah, and 5 sheep and 10 camels are still due from them. Further, they dared to attack Deh Shaikh flour mill, carrying off six loads of flour. Later, several sections of the Khizils entered British territory without permission, and their chief men refused to obey the Asst. Political Officer, Mandali, when sent for. Also they fired on the police of the British Government who were sent in connection with the collection of the koda, a tax which the Government of Traq has a right to collect on all sheep which graze within its boundaries. The koda is still due from them. Also many other things have occurred. On 18th Rajab (April 30th) two citizens of Mandali were robbed in Hashimah by some of your subjects, and the following things were taken from them, viz. : their clothes, four liras of money, two loads of wheat, two loads of rice, one load khordwat and one donkey. On 14th Ramzan (June 24th) four Arabs of the Sa’ada tribe, living in Mandali district, were similarly attacked in the same place. One was killed and the others were stripped. On 5th Shawal (July 14th) Hasan, son of Huwais, a notorious thief, stole a valuable mare from the A1 Hamad tribe. A few days later news came that this mare was with ‘Abbas, son of ‘Abdul Husain, son of Mali. On 30th Shawal (August 8th) two men were robbed of one load of wheat and one load of barley in ‘Umairiyat by some Arabs from your territory. On 29th Zil Qa‘da (September 6th) one Taufiq of Mandali was wounded by the herdsmen that tend the buffaloes in Dasht i Lih and robbed £T24/- and one load of ghee. Of all these events you are not ignorant, yet you have made no reparation nor kave you punished the offenders. Further, now it is reported that you are collecting a tax of two krans churukh, or one rupee, on all sheep which leave your territory for Mandali. The Mamurs who collect the tax’take also another two krans for themselves. This increases the price of sheep in Mandali by two rupees. The exaction of the tax shows that you are not friendly to the British Government. Also since cholera became rife in Mandali, you have placed Mamurs in Saumer on account of the quarantine so that none may come in or go out. The aforementioned mamurs prevent none coming in or going out, but take money from all men by force. («)e » 251 APPENDIX No. 2. (a) Khaniqin. —1. Land Revenue in cash and in kind for year 1918.

Charge.— The civil administration of the Samawah Division commenced with the arrival of Capt. Goldsmith in Samawah in November 1917; this officer remained in charge till 4th April 1918, when he was relieved by Capt. Fowle. I took over from the latter officer on 14th July 1918, and continued in charge during the remainder of the year. The following Assistant Political Officers served in the Division at various periods of the year :—Capt. Fletcher, Capt. Talbot, Lieut. Taunton. My present Assistants are Capt. Ashton (A.P.O., Rumaithah), Capt. Phillips (A.P.O., Samawah), Lieut. Woodward (A.P.O. in charge of Shabanahs, Rumaithah) and Mr. G. Georgius (P.A. to P.O., acting as Government Agent, Shinafiyah). 2. Area.— The Samawah Division extends for about 120 miles along either bank of the Euphrates River, from Darraji in the south-east to the rapids 8 miles above * Shinafiyah in the north-west. Its maximum breadth is about 80 miles. On the north-west it adjoins the Shamiyah Division; on the north-east, the Kut Division; on the east, south and south-west the Nasiriyah Division; to the south-west the boundary is a line some 50 miles from the Euphrates, passing through Jufah (Kafr). The population of the Division has been estimated at 150,000, but this of course can only be an approximate estimate, as no census has been taken, except in the towns; and even there the Arab, with his inherent suspicion of new things, has done his best to baffle the enumerators. The Division includes the districts of Rumaithah, Samawah and Shinafiyah. 3. Political and Tribal.— There are in the Division 19 tribes, distributed as follows :—Rumaithah district: Bani Zuraij, Bani ‘Ardh, Khazaffi, A1 ‘Ajib, A1 Dhawalim, Albu Jaiyash and Albu Hassan. Samawah district: A1 Zaiyad, A1 Sufran, Jawabir, A1 Muhsin, A1 ‘Abas, A1 Barkat, A1 Tobah. Shinafiyah district: A1 ‘Ayyash, Bani Salamah, Khafajah, Albu Saqir, Albu Hulail, and a section of the Dhafir tribe. It will be more convenient to deal with the political and tribal affairs of the Division according to the geographical distribution of the tribes. Rumaithah .—The Albu Jaiyash is the strongest tribe numerically, while the Bani Zuraij is the wealthiest; the chief of the latter tribe. Shaikh ‘Abdul ‘Abbas al Farhud, owns most of the land on the left bank of the Hillah Canal from Rumaithah to Saiyid Muhsin Abu Tabikh’s property at Hamzah. This Shaikh is for various reasons on very bad terms with most of the surrounding tribes, and in June of this year his enmity with the Albu Hassan tribe culminated in a pitched battle, in which each side had over 40 men killed. As might be expected, this has not tended to reduce the mutual hatred, and it is only the restraining influence of the Political Officer which keeps the two parties from again flying at each other’s throats. The other tribes are of lesser importance; but it is worth noting that the relations between the Bani ‘Ardh and the Khaza‘il are always somewhat strained, mainly owing to quarrels over land. In spite of these disturbing influences, the state of the district is fairly satisfactory. Samawah .—The Al Zaiyad is the largest and most important tribe of the district. Its members were at one time mainly cultivators; but, owing to the silting up of the Sahlawiyah Channel which used to water their lands, they have been forced to become herdsmen, and during the winter practically the whole tribe is out in the Shamiyah desert with the flocks and herds. Buraid al Jahil, the head Shaikh, is well disposed to us and trustworthy; but, unfortunately, as is so often the case in this part of the country, he does not control the whole tribe, and his influence is confined to a very few sections. The only other tribe of importance in E 256 this district is the A1 Sufran, which possessed lands on the left bank of the Euphrates about 15 miles downstream from Samawah. This is one of the most troublesome of the tribes of the Division. Its head Shaikh, Ma‘jun al Hamadi, submitted to Capt. Goldsmith in November 1917; but he seems to be either unwilling or unable to restrain the unruly members of his tribe or to make them obey orders, and sooner or later he and his people will have to be taught a salutary lesson. Shinafiyah .—This is the least important district of the Division; the tribes are for the most p^rt weak, under petty shaikhs, and of no great political importance. Like the Al Zaiyad tribe, of the Samawah district, they were originally cultivators, and Shinafiyah was famed for its grain output, but the water level has fallen and made cultivation difficult and expensive. Consequently, the tribes have become cattle and sheep owners, and spend a large portion of the year wandering in and out of the Shinafiyah district, seeking pastures for their flocks and herds. Their favourite grazing grounds are towards Al Batn and Loqah in the south and south west, and the Mishkhab and Ghammas in the north. The tribes do not appear to have had headmen of outstanding authority before our occupation, and some of the shaikhs appear to be singularly unwilling to accept the responsibility of the chieftainship which we have thrust upon them. Up to date the tribes, though wild, have given very little trouble; and, in case of any rising, I think it would be very easily quelled. A monthly allowance of Rs. 150/ - p. m. has been sanctioned for each of the shaikhs, with effect from 1st December 1918. The heads of the Sadah party in Shinafiyah town were implicated in the plot which was defeated at Najaf, and Saiyid Hadi Mugotar and Saiyid Husain Mugotar were deported to India. Generally, the conduct of the tribes of the Division has been fairly satisfactory; they appear to be content with the British rule, and have a pleasing readiness to obey orders. We have received considerable assistance from many of the leading men. How much of this satisfactory state of affairs is due to genuine goodwill, and how much to fear of the Armies of Occupation, remains to be seen. 4. Revenue.— Owing to the fact that this was the first year that revenue had been taken in these parts, also that the tribes were in an unsettled state, the Civil Commissioner, on my recommendation, permitted a reduction of the figures of Miri required from the tribes. The assessment was exceedingly unsatisfactory, and I am hopeful that next year a systematic measuring by other than Arabs may be found possible. In all, some 1,500 tons have been collected this year, part of which (again with special permission from the Civil Commissioner) has been paid for. . /k) Tapu.—-There has^ been no Tapu registration in the Division since the British Occupation. It is important that this should be undertaken soon, as there considerable amount of Tapu land. Saiyid Muhsin Abu Tabikh and Haii Abdul Abbas al Farhud, of the Bani Zuraij tribe, are the biggest holders of Tapu land; the former owns most of the land between the Hillah Canal and Al Qass in the Siunaflyah district, while the latter has considerable holdings on the left bank a n 1 ! 16 -S. P ai l al * A lar § e num ber of landlords in Samawah hold Tapu sanads. All buildings m Samawah, Rumaithah and Shinafiyah have been numbered and general arrangements have been made for the work of the Tapu Mamur who’ it D hoped, will soon be sent from Baghdad. _ (c) Waqf. The only Waqf properties are in Samawah and Shinafiyah towns They are of no great importance and consist mainly of khans for the accommodation of pilgrims and Husamiyahs ” (places of lamentation). All are managed bv the original owners or their descendants, and Government has no share in their (d) Miscellaneous and Special toereMes.—Taxes are collected on fish wood ,uss and vegetables, and the kodah and tobacco licences are worked on the same lines as elsewhere. The taxes are collected in the usual way in the market-places and regular check is made by the various Officers in charge and Revenue Mamurs’ The total amounts collected are shown in the list attached to this Report (AppenrhxL)'. (e) Customs. A sum of Rs. 5/- was collected in Shinafiyah on tobacco on which duty had not already been paid. No other Customs dues were received (f) Compensation. —Nil. feRiGATiON.-During the year a bund was constructed at the foot of the Hillah Canal, this has held up the water and greatly increased the area for ricecultivation. The Saffah Canal, which takes off from the foot of the Hillah Canal, has been deepened; no other works of any importance have been undertaken by the Irrigation Department. Excluding a few hundred acres watered by springs in the Shamiyah district, practically all the irrigation in the Division is done by means of charads and pumping engines (there are 22 of the latter), but the falling of the water level has made this a difficult and costly business, and it is highly important that efforts should be made to raise the water level. To effect this, two alternative schemes have been proposed. The first is the building of a dam across the ‘Atshan near its mouth, below A1 Gharab village; this would raise the water level in the Saqlawiyah Canal. The Assistant Irrigation Officer, Samawah, is considering the scheme, and will submit a report on its practicability in due course. The second scheme is one which has the support of all the influential landholders in the Division. It consists of a proposal to build in a “ sud ” or barrage on the Daghfiliyah (Sabil) about 10 miles above Chamchah. It is said that this would raise the level of the whole river right up to the rapids, and so bring under irrigation 1,00,000 misharas of land of which at present no use is made. In the time of the Turks, a bund was actually built at this spot by four of the Sarkals; but it was not strong enough to withstand the flow of water, and it was washed away again in a couple of days. Still, the fact that these Sarkals, who are present authorities on the subject of irrigation, were willing to sink money in such an experiment, shows their strong belief in the utility of the scheme. It is asserted by the Arabs that navigation would proceed along the ‘Atshan branch of the river. I do not know how far this scheme is workable, but I intend to ask the Irrigation Department and the I.W.T. to report on it. If ib is approved by them, the only objection that could be urged would be that the Military Posts at Wa‘ar would be left more or less high and dry; and, of course, that point would have to be taken into consideration before any final decision is made. Another irrigation scheme which will have to be considered in the near future is the improvement of the old Abu Dibis Canal which takes off from the Mash kail River near Kharun and ends near Chamchah. It is said that this canal and its offshoots could irrigate some 10,000 misharas of land. 6. Agricultural. —The Division has great agricultural possibilities, and in the past it was famed for its great grain output. With the improvement of irrigation facilities it wall undoubtedly regain its former prosperity, as the soil is magnificent. The crops at present grown are barley, wheat, rice, dukhn, mash, simsim, and lobeya; vegetables are plentiful in and about Samawah. There is a scarcity of plough animals in the Division, and it is hoped that the Agricultural Department will be able to help us in the matter. I strongly recommend the posting of an Agricultural Officer to the Division. 7. Municipalities. —Samawah, Rumaithah, and Shinafiyah have munici palities managed by a Rais. All are on a sound financial basis, and are self- supporting. These municipalities are all, more or less, in their infancy, and it has not been thought advisable to hurry things; but the cleanliness and health of the town are carefully looked after, and the latrines and incinerators have been constructed. In some cases it has been found difficult to procure sweepers, but that difficulty is being gradually overcome. It is not easy to interest the towns people in the running of the municipalities, but I hope that this will come in time, and that we shall soon have properly constituted town councils. At present I fear that the people regard our passion for cleanliness and sanitation rather as a freakish whim, to be humoured but not to be encouraged. 8. Judicial. —The great majority of judicial cases which come up before Political Officers are civil claims for the recovery of loans and petitions for divorce. These cases when not dealt with summarily by the Political Officers, are usually settled with the help of arbitrators in accordance with Mohammadan law. The only two criminal cases of importance were taken up during the year. In one a certain Shanawah and accomplices were accused of murdering two merchants from Najd in Shinafiyah; this case was settled by Capt. Goldsmith, Political Officer, Samawah, and Capt. Fletcher. The accused was fined and paid blood money. In the second, the sentence of death passed by the Political Officer on Jasim ibn Muhammad, of A1 ‘Ajib tribe, for the murder of Sultan ibn Jabbar, was commuted by G.O.C.-in-Chief (Explanatory Memo., Appendix 2, attached). Otherwise there58 has been a general absence of serious crime. Reports of petty crimes have been dealt with summarily by the officers concerned. 9. Education. —There are small schools at Rumaithah and A1 Gharab. Samawah with its 10,000 inhabitants would appear to need a school, but there is no general demand for education, and although people have told me that they would send their children to school if there were one, they are not at all inclined to put their hands in their pockets and pay for buildings or teachers. 10. Medical and Sanitation. —A Civil Hospital with Sub-Assistant Surgeon in charge was opened at Samawah in the end of December 1918, one of the Medical Officers from the Samawah Camp to act as visiting officer for instructions and operations. A dresser is posted in Rumaithah; there are no other civil Medical Officers. The Division is, on the whole, a healthy one, but there is always a con siderable amount of small-pox, and this year there was an epidemic of cholera and a serious outbreak of the universal influenza, the number of deaths from pneumonia being considerable. A travelling dispensary and vaccinator in the Division will be a useful and welcome institution. This, it is hoped, will come into practice as soon as the Civil Hospital has commenced working properly. The efforts made to improve the sanitation have been described under the head “ Municipalities.” British ranks have been placed in charge of the sanitary squads at Rumaithah and Samawah with good results. 11. Shabanahs. —The total sanctioned strength of Shabanahs for the Division is 331, distributed as follows :—Rumaithah, 121; Samawah, 151 ; and Shinafiyah, 59. We have recruited up to full strength, but it has been necessary to put considerable pressure on the towns and tribes in order to achieve this result. The Division has never before supplied men for Government service, and such service is distinctly unpopular. The recruits fear that we are going to make soldiers of them, and when we began to drill them the townspeople used to assemble and make sport of the recruits. It is consequently not surprising that it is difficult to get men, but a distinct improvement is perceptible, particularly in Samawah and Rumaithah. The men are taking kindly enough to drill and they appear to enjoy the authority which Government service gives them. The subordinate staff is another difficulty, the Onbashis are men of the old school, and the Arab drill instructors are apt to be careless. Still, in spite of all this, I consider that a surprising standard of efficiency has been attained. 12. Labour.—A large amount of Arab labour has been employed on railway construction work. Forcible collection of labour has been necessary in many cases and, even so, it has been difficult to provide our quota. The Shaikhs complain that their men earn only about 4 annas a day (this, of course, is their own fault), and consequently they have to pay the labourers extra money out of their own pockets. They also say that the labourers are taken away from their work in the. fields to the detriment of agriculture. Others explain their failure to provide labourers by saying that the whole tribe is miles away out in the desert grazing cattle, and that makes it very difficult to provide reliefs. It is unfortunate that up till recently the railway authority did not make any arrangement for the accommodation and shelter of Arab labourers, as this has distinctly added to the general dislike for the work. There is no doubt that this labour question has been a great cause of dissatisfaction amongst the tribes. It has caused discontent at a time when we particularly want to allay such a feeling, and I doubt if the work done compensates for the unrest it has produced. Any satisfactory solution of the problem would come as a great relief both to the tribes and to the Political Officer. Personally, I think that the work could be done much more satisfactorily by a few Indian Labour Corps. 13. Miscellaneous. —On the whole I consider that the year’s working has been satisfactory. Our relations with the tribes are friendly and there has-been no serious outbreak and but little serious crime. Prices of all commodities are high, but that is true of the whole of Mesopotamia. On my taking over the Division there was but one road from Nasiriyah-Samawah-Shinafiyah; two new roads have since been constructed, one from Diwaniyah to Rumaithah, the other from Rumaithah to Wa‘ar. Both these roads are in good condition and passable for cars during nine months of the year.61 APPENDIX No. 2. Crown v. Jasim ibn Muhammad. Memorandum. Jasim ibn Muhammad was tried before the Political Officer, Samawah, on the charge, first, of wilful murder of his uncle Sultan ibn Jabbar, and, secondly, of inflicting serious bodily injuries on Mukhaif al Salab, and was found guilty of both charges and condemned to death. The accused admitted the murder, but stated that he was acting in accordance with tribal custom, since Sultan ibn Jabbar, about a year previously, had murdered his (the accused’s) father. After the trial further enquiries were made by the Political Officer with regard to the circum stances of the murder, with the result that it is established :— {a) That Sultan ibn Jabbar had previously murdered the accused’s father ; (b) That the accused was acting in accordance with tribal law in exacting vengeance by killing Sultan ibn Jabbar ; and (c) That the heirs of Sultan ibn Jabbar do not demand compensation, and that none is payable according to tribal law. It is clear, therefore, that, according to tribal law, the accused, so far from committing any crime by killing Sultan ibn Jabbar, has only performed the duty incumbent on him of avenging his father— a duty which he could not avoid without tarnishing his honour amongst his fellow tribesmen. Under these circumstances it would not be just to carry out the death sentence. Nevertheless, as the district in which the murder was committed has come under settled government, tribesmen must learn that they must no longer take the law into their own hands, and a moderate term of imprisonment is necessary for this purpose. As regards the charge of inflicting serious bodily injury on Mukhail al Salab, it is clear that the act was not intentional, the bullet by which Sultan ibn Jabbar was killed having passed through his body and struck Mukhail al Salab. The accused is guilty of criminal neghgence only on this charge. I have accordingly commuted the sentence of death by the court to one of rigorous imprisonment for two years. Mukhail al Salab made no claim for compensation at the trial, and the injury seems to have been slight, but the order does not preclude his obtaining compensation if he puts forward a claim and the injury justifies it.

Political and Tribal : Boundaries and General Description of the Division .— The Shamiyah Division is the land watered by the Hindiyah River from Kifl, where the river divides into two branches, known as the Kufah and Shamiyah Channels,64 to Shinafiyah, just above which town the two streams there, called the Mishkha and the Ghammas, reunite, together with the desert to the West. The boundaries are not as yet exactly defined and will inevitably remain vague till a boundary commission traces some definite demarcation. As a rough guide the boundary is on the North a line running East and West coming from the desert cutting the river just below where it forks at Kill and extending at a point some 13 miles East of the river. On the East the boundary runs from this point North and South through the Hor ibn Najm, of which two-thirds lie in the Eiwaniyah District, after which it turns slightly towards the Eastward till it reaches a point some 7 miles South- West of Saiyid Hasan Abu Tabikh. From there the Southern boundary is a straight line to Shinafiyah, which lies just outside the Division, and from Shinafiyah due West into the desert, the Division including A1 Quaim. The habitable area is thus some 50 miles long by 30 broad. Topographically the Division falls naturally into three distinct parts : agricul tural Shamiyah, the town of Najaf and Kufah, and the desert. (а) Agricultural Shamiyah .—This is the land watered by the two rivers—that is, the island from Kifl to Shinafiyah and the limits of irrigation to the East and West. In the extreme North of the District irrigation by lift only is possible, and the country is almost bare of trees. Especially is this the case on the right bank of the Kufah Channel from Kifl until a few miles above Kufah, the land here rising fairly rapidly to the bluff which dominates the Najaf Sea. But beginning at points some 3 miles North of Kufah on the one channel and Abu Shorah on the other, the banks fall away and direct irrigation is carried on from the river by means of tubars or small canals. From here to Turumah on the Mishkhab and Kharm on the Ghammas is the Garden of ‘Iraq. Dense gardens of date-palm, vines and figs clothe the banks of the river and of every large canal, while there is no canal, however insignificant, without its row of willows and poplar (gharab). There are numerous small towns and villages, while every Shaikh or Saiyid of importance possesses an imposing “ qasr ” surrounded by gardens with a small permanent settlement about it. In the North of the District on the island to a line between Abu Sukhair and Umm al Ba‘rur excellent spring crops are grown. The land East of the Shamiyah Channel in the Hor al Dukhn bears spring crops, while between Salachiyah and Umm al Ba‘rur both spring crops and summer rice flourish. South of Umm al BaTur and Abu Sukhair, given a sufficiency of water, lies the finest rice-growing tract in ‘Iraq. On the Western river lie the towns of Kufah and Ja‘arah Abu Sukhair, and further South the large village of Turumah. The town of Kufah is situated in dense date gardens. Its main importance is, however, as the port of Najaf, with which town it is connected by tram. It may, therefore, be properly excluded from agricultural Shamiyah, Ja‘arah Abu Sukhair is situated in the famous date gardens of Ja‘arah and its population, including the non-tribal garden population, is estimated at 10,000. Turumah is an island at the head of the Shinafiyah lake and the market of the Ghazalat. On the Eastern river lie, in order from North to South, the village of Abu Shorah, which is rapidly becoming the market of the Hor al Dukhn Bani Hasan ; Salachiyah, a large village containing over 90 shops on the Hor ibn Najam and the market of the Ja‘arah; Muhannawiyah, some 5 miles off the river on the Muhannawiyah Canal, similar to Salachiyah and the market of the Shamiyah Fatlah: ‘Aqar on the ‘Aqar Canal, a similar type of village belonging to the Kurd; Umm al BaTur on the river itself, a prosperous town of some 4,000 inhabitants and the seat of government of Eastern Shamiyah' and Ghammas, a small town on the lower reaches of the river, the property of Saiyid Muhsin Abu Tabikh. (б) The Toivn of Najaf .—West of Kufah the land rises gradually to a height of 120 feet above the river in a distance of about 6 miles. It then falls away suddenly to a depression below the level of the Euphrates, pear-shaped, and some 15 miles broad, known as the Najaf Sea. Due West of Kufah, on the summit of this bluff which decreases in height Southwards till at Abu Sukhair it is almost level with the surrounding country, stands the town of Najaf. Completely walled, in the midst of the desert, dominated by the golden dome of the shrine of Hadhrat ‘Ali, said to be visible three days’ march away, it presents a sight not easily forgotten. ’ Except for the tombs of the Wadi al Salam and a few khans, it is self-contained within the . walls. No green thing can be seen, even water has to be brought in skins three- quarters of a mile from the foot of the cliff. To enter it is to be plunged 400 years65 into the past. Cut off from the world, but an emporium of trade for the desert, its appearance does not belie its character—the Holiest City of the Shhahs, a turbulent desert town, the seat of religious fanaticism and bigotry, of intrigue and turmoil, oppressive wealth and sanctified poverty, and of a commercial moralitv and practice which cannot have its equal in the world. The population of Najaf is estimated at some 45,000 persons. The town of Kufah, with 7,000, is a suburb and at the same time the port of Najaf. It possesses the characteristics of the Euphrates river town—a good river front, which will soon be greatly improved by the river-wall, fine bazars and good buildings gradually extending along the tram-line towards Najaf. (c) The Desert. That is the Najaf Sea and the fringe of oases that lie between it and the Syrian desert proper. Formerly this was under the control of the Political Officer, Desert, but lately has come again under Shamiyah, an arrangement eminently suitable, as such cultivation or date groves that exist are nearly all the property of ISajafis or Shamiyah people. The line of oases from North to South is Hayadhiyah, Ruhaimah, Rahabah and A1 Qaim. At Hayadhiyah there are good date groves, at Ruhaimah fine wheat is grown, while the Sea of Najaf itself, now dried except for accumulations of rain water by the construction of the Qurnah dam, offers great possibilities for flow irrigation from the Euphrates. The whole is a country of infinite variety of scenery. The oases of the Syrian desert, a holy city in which it is possible to realise the truth of the characters in the “ Arabian Nights,” the prosperous commercial town of the Euphrates, the dense date groves of Basrah, the wheat and barley lands of Hindiyah, the rice lands of Amarah, the marshes of Qurnah, all are there. Through it flows a river in its upper reaches equalling the Tigris in horror, in its lower vying with the Thames in beauty. And so with the people, the nomad, the riverain settled Arab, the Mujtahid, the merchant and the holy poor. A 100 years’ study could not read their character and a thousand pages could not portray it. (2) Trade and Communications. —Najaf and Kufah lie on the old pilgrim road from Baghdad to Mecca, a road which continues beyond to the borders of China. This road is still used for pilgrim traffic and for trade with the Shammar of Northern Arabia, who in normal times bring in their caravans of wool and ghi to exchange for rice and piece goods. The main channel of communication is, of course, by river, and there are few parts of the district which, owing to the large canals, are not accessible by bellum. Najaf and Kufah are connected by tram, which with improvement and increase of rolling stock will inevitably absorb the very large trade of the town. The road to Ja‘arah takes a certain amount of traffic, mainly market produce, from the Shamiyah to Najaf. The communications with Baghdad lie by river to Kifl and thence by rail, or by motor road from Kufah via Qakat ‘Abbasiyah to Hillah. The Karbala road will probably fall out of use unless a light railway should be built between the two towns, communication being far easier by boat. As regards lateral communications, a good road runs between Kufah and Abu Shorah on the Shamiyah Channel, and between Abu Sukhair and Umm al Ba‘rur a road will probably be constructed at no distant date, though the result of this year’s flood on the island must be seen before such work is midertaken. From Umm al Ba c rur a direct road is in course of construction to Diwaniyah on the Hillah Channel. Bridges exist at Kufah, and at Qakat ‘Abbasiyah on the Shamiyah Channel, and there are ferries taking a large volume of traffic at Abu Sukhair, on the Kufah Channel and at Abu Shorah, Umm al Ba‘rur, Umm Shawarif and Ghammas on the Shamiyah Channel. The geographical position of Kufah from the point of view of trade is of great importance. It lies in the great rice-growing district of Mesopotamia, and so is a collecting centre for a raw product which is marketable directly to Najaf or the Beduin or which can be exported North to Baghdad. The movement of trade is the export of rice to the desert or Northwards, and the import of manufactured goods direct from Basrah and, in a small degree, from Baghdad for home consumption or for re-export to the desert. (3) Turkish Administrative Divisions. —Under the Ottoman Government the town of Najaf was a qaimmakamlik controlled by the Mutasarrif of Karbala. Under the control of this qaimmakam also came the Nahiyah of Kufah, at which place a Mudir was stationed, and which included Abu Shorah and Hor al Dukhn.66 Abu Sukhair was a qaimmaqamliq under the Mutasarrif of Diwamyah, and included in his charge were the Nahiyahs of Shinafiyah, Ghammas, and Umm al Ga rur, at which there were Mudirs. Shu‘bah establishments also existed at Umm al J3a rur, Abu Sukhair, Mishkhab, and Ghammas. A battalion was stationed at Najaf, and various police posts were scattered throughout the district, which was certainly the most unpopular and probably the most dangerous in ‘Iraq. Post and telegraph offices existed at Najaf, Abu Sukhair, and Umm al Ba rur, and, theoretically at least, there w'as a quarantine station at Najaf to deal with the corpse and pilgrim traffic. (4) General Character and Distribution of Inhabitants .—The names and location of the various tribes inhabiting the Shamiyah Division are given in some detail in the Arab Bureau’s publication, “ The Euphrates Channels,” and the character of the more prominent personalities in such degree as they have up to the present displaved themselves, is added as an appendix to this Report. The main confedera tions are the Bani Hasan, the Fatlah, and the Khaza‘il. But the tendency, carefully fostered by the policy of the Turk and the granting of large Muqata‘ahs to Saiyids, who soon gather around them fallahs from every tribe to become permanent settlers on their lands, is for definite splits into different subsections owing no allegiance but to the Shaikh of the subsection and Government. The Jarrah no longer admit the Shaikh of the Bani Hasan as their overlord, nor do the ‘Awabid. The Shibil, Al Ibrahim, and Ghazalat do not acknowledge the chiefs of the Khaza‘il. It is easy to multiply instances. To arrive at even an approximately just estimation of the character and habits of the people, urban and rural, it is necessary to survey, however briefly, the history of Shamiyah and of the town of Najaf in the past. The prevailing characteristics of the Najafi and the Shamiyah agriculturist are profoundly different, but each has not been without his influence on the other, a mutual influence which security and improved communications can only increase. The Tribes .—To consider the tribes first. Only 50 years ago the Khaza‘il were the kings of the Middle Euphrates, owning a merely nominal allegiance to the Turk, and entirely absolved from revenue. At about this time, however, the Hillah channel began to decay, and the increased flow of water down the Hindiyah channel soon began to show its results in a tendency of Euphrates tribes to migrate from the Hillah and the Upper Hindiyah to the Shamiyah. The Turks were not slow to seize this Heaven-sent opportunity to break the power of the Khaza‘il by the introduction of alien and hostile tribes. They also brought in another experi ment designed towards the same ends, the grant of large areas to Saiyids. Some of these Saiyids claim to have obtained possession of the land before even the appearance of the Turk in this area, but there is no doubt that the majority were introduced by the Turks, and that even those whu -may have been there before were encouraged and their claims regarded favourably by the Ottoman Government. There is another theory that the Khaza‘il themselves created the power of the Saiyids owing to the respect they had for them. That the Turks effectively broke the Khaza‘il confederation is a self-evident fact, but that they themselves did not gain any direct influence or revenue and failed completely to administer the country is equally obvious. The sole result of their efforts was the replacement of a powerful confederacy by a number of large landed proprietors, Shaikh or Saiyid, enjoying almost complete local autonomy, preying at wall upon a weaker or less fortunate neighbour, and regarding with only too well-justified contempt the feeble attempts of corrupt officials to collect one per cent, of the revenue demand. The rapidly increasing prosperity of the Shamiyah, the distance from Baghdad, and the proximity of Najaf, as always a centre of intrigue and rebellion, all contributed towards a feeling of independence and confidence in their own abilities which made the Shamiyah Shaikhs both the terror and despair of the Ottoman Government. The attempt to collect the rice revenue was invariably the prelude to quite extensive autumn manoeuvres on the part of several battalions, and the murder of the hated Sunni official was an agreeable pastime. With the Fatlah alone, whom they themselves had introduced and who are the hereditary enemies of the Khazahl, did the Turk retain any influence, and this was owing to the ability of Mubdir al Fara‘un.67 It is not, therefore, surprising to find that at the outbreak of war the Shamiyah Shaikhs were in communication with the Sharif of Mecca for the formation of an independent Arab Kingdom. Again, an interesting and relevant point is that the great majority of the Shamiyah Shaikhs grow rice. In these cases the authority of the Shaikhs over the cultivator is absolute, an extreme autocracy. The reason for this is probably the severity of the life of the rice cultivator, and the absolute necessity for organised labour and constant attention. The cultivator has found by* experience that lack of organisation produces a bad crop, and that his only hope lies in implicit obedience to the tribal chief. Also this paramount authority is found among the Arab of the desert. This is a marked contradistinction to the shitwi-growing Shaikh, whose tribesmen are far freer and can and do exercise greater independence of action and opinion. The beginning of war, therefore, found Shamiyah a large fertile tract, thickly populated with armed bands of robbers, owning implicit obedience to wealthy, ignorant, and swollen-headed chiefs, inspiring terror in the hearts of all, including the Turkish Government. In April 1915 the Turkish Government was driven out of Najaf, and Shamiyah at once followed Najaf’s example. From this date till the beginning of 1918, the interregnum between the removal of Turkish control and the organisation of our Government, enabled the tribal Shaikhs to assert their authority to a degree which formerly had been impossible, but which was the inevitable outcome of the Turkish policy. It further gave them a taste of complete independence and entire freedom from necessity of paying any revenue, which pleasurable sensation they will not easily forget. The Najafis .—The Najafi is as much a creature of his environment as is the Shamiyah tribesman. Half Persian, living in an atmosphere of bigotry, often wealthy, yet professing poverty, looking on pilgrims and Bedus coming in to trade alike as his lawful prey, isolated, but the receiver and distorter of all the news of the world, which he inevitably hears through the stream of the faithful pouring into the Holy City, he exercises a malign influence far beyond the limits of his town or even of ‘Iraq. His isolation, and the prestige he exercises over those who perforce visit him in his lair, tend to make him independent and impatient of reform or control. This applies with greater force to the Arab population of Najaf. The Persians, as aliens, are naturally less independent and fear the Arab. But they, again, can be obstructive : any attempt to touch their pockets in the way of taxation was met by a protest from the Persian Government, resulting in exemption. As the holiest city of the Shi‘ahs and the seat of the great Mujtahids it has naturally been a predominant influence in all Shi‘ah and especially Persian affairs. The large Shar‘ah cases, involving many interests in Persia, are decided in Najaf. A Shah of Persia, to carry out any important measure, was compelled to obtain the advice and support of the Mujtahids, and did he ever act without their consent they were not slow to make their influence felt. The Shahs of Persia invariably took care to placate the leading Mujtahids of Najaf, well knowing that they might, in extreme cases, have to rely on their support to retain their throne It is said that it is fully within the power of a great Mujtahid to excommunicate the Shah. It was not, however, until there presented itself the magnificent opportunity afforded by the unfortunate wave of intelligent democracy that spread over the East some 10 years ago and resulted, first, in the Persian and, later, in the Turkish Constitutions, that Najaf rose to its full height as a storm-centre of political intrigue. The Constitutionalists were well aware that they stood little chance of success were they unable to obtain the influence of some leading Mujtahids on their side. Every means in their power was exerted to obtain the desired result, and finally they triumphed, owing to the definite commitment of Akhund Khurasani to their party. Since that date Najaf has been but a reflection of the varying political parties at work in Persia, the continual efforts of the “ outs ” to obtain the influence of some great Mujtahid which will prejudice the “ ins.” Though the great Mujtahids hold aloof, the continual intrigue of the smaller fry is often successful. An ignorant and superstitious populace goes with them, and the great Mujtahid, whose power is based on popularity, is compelled to acquiesce and to put his name to a pronouncement which may have serious effects. Such is now the religious side of Najaf, Mujtahids, ‘Alims, and students all profoundly ignorant, played upon by self-seeking politicians in Tehran or Baghdadm the hopes that they will be sufficiently deceived to give utterance to an opinion which, as promulgated by the religious dignitaries of the Holy City, cannot fail to have a disturbing effect upon the common mind. The merchant of Najaf belongs to a bygone age, an age when merchandise travelled by caravan through incredible dangers, when the result of a venture was not known for years, and the minimum remuneration was a 100 per cent. The Persian pilgrim, drunk with religious fervour, or the wild Bedu, stunned at the sight of a house, are equally at his mercy. The insecurity of the roads during the palmiest days of Turkish control, the influx of goods which poured into Najaf after the battle of Shu‘aibah and which made it for two years the emporium of ‘Iraq, have not modified his views. He will keep a tin of oil thirty years in his Sardabs in the hope that the price will rise an anna, and the only remedy is a plantation of Jews or an importation of Indian marwaris. The Townsman—The Zuqurt and the Shumurt. —The origin of these two town tribes or municipal factions is vague, and such stories as do exist as to it are probably untrue. They are Arab, though inevitably with some Persian blood. For over a hundred years they have been the dominant factor in the life of the town; by heredity in a state of almost open war with each other, making the life of any peaceful citizen a burden to him unless he joined one of the factions and subscribed heavily to the party funds; openly antagonistic to law and order, and rendering entirely abortive the feeble attempts of a terrified qaimmaqam, backed up by a battalion of soldiers, at municipal improvement or any form of Government whatever. So powerful were they, or so weak was the Government, that the only remedy the latter could devise was to back the weaker party in the yearly fight. The outbreak of war and the defeat of the Turks at Shu‘aibah, at which battle many Najafis were present, gave them their long-awaited opportunity. The Turks were fully alive to the situation and had taken considerable precautions, but Karim al Haji Sa‘ad with 30 men succeeded in entering the town, which was then under martial law, through a hole in the wall in April 1915, and in keeping the Turks at bay for 24 hours, by which time help had come from outside and the whole town had risen and joined the insurgents. With 10,000 riflemen against them and their food and water cut off, the Turks stood little chance and capitulated three days later. They were disarmed and allowed to depart to Kifl. From that date till August 1917, Najaf enjoyed complete local autonomy under the rule of the four Shaikhs of the Zuqurt and Shumurt. How any respectable citizen survived with bis life or with his money is a mystery. Each quarter was a law unto itself; murders and street fighting were the order of the day. What must have been a grimly humorous sight was the evening meeting of the four Shaikhs at the well-known coffee-house at the beginning of the grand bazaar, when those whom they facetiously termed their Mamurs brought the day’s spoils which they had looted under the plea of municipal taxation. This was scrupulously divided into four equal heaps, and each Shaikh then returned to his house with his share. Their power they kept up by bands of armed bullies of their own factions. Their prestige was further enhanced by subsidies from us. The magnitude of their exactions can be realised when the extent of the property acquired or built by them is viewed and it is remembered that, with the exception of Sai , id Mahdi, all were nonentities before this period. Such was Najaf in August 1917, when Hamid Khan was appointed the first Government Agent. (5). Events mShamiyah. and Najaf from August 1917—when the first Government Agents were appointed—till May 4, 1918, the Blockade was raised —After the capture of Baghdad and previous to the appointment of Government Agents in August, we had exercised an indirect control in Shamiyah and Naiaf through subventions paid to the leading personalities of the area. On the eastern side these were Salman al Muhammad al ‘Abtan and Salman al Dhahir all of the Khaza'il For Abu Sukhair and Ja'arah, Saiyid Hadi Zuwain, the influence of whose familv is considerable m that town, was appointed. In Mishkhab, Mubdir al Fara'un the head of the Fatlah, was loyal. In Kufah, ‘Alwan al Haji Sa‘dun, of the Bani Hasan controlled the town owing to his hold over the surrounding tribes !n Najaf, the power lay in the hands of the four Shaikhs of the town each controlling his own quarter. These were Saiyid Mahdi al Saivid Salman head of the Zuqurt; Haji ‘Atiyah Abu Qulal and Kadhim Subhi, both also of^ Ztr and Haji Sa‘ad ibn Haji Radhi, head of the Shumurt Z q ’The next stage was the appointment of regular Government Agents with Police and Revenue staffs. This was in August 1917, Hamid Khan being sent to Naiaf, Sarkis Effendi to Kufah, and Saiyid Mahmud Tabaqchali to Abu Sukhair. All did very fine work in the difficult task of asserting their authority in the face of the former lucrative local autonomy. In Najaf itself, however, the hold of the Shaikhs wa f ^ 0 ° was 80011 apparent that effective Government control would not be established without covert, and probably open, opposition. In October 1917, Capt. F. 0. C. Balfour was appointed Political Officer, Sham- iyah, and took up his headquarters in Kufah. at antagonism of the Najaf Shaikhs was soon shown in the first week of November 1917. High food prices in Najaf coincided with the arrival of a number o± Amzah to buy gram. Orders were given to the Najaf Shaikhs to recover the property stolen from the ‘Anizah within 15 days. On 20th November, at the expiration of the allotted period, Haji c Atiyah Abu Qulal, one of the Shaikhs concerned, rather than undertake to pay his share of the unrecovered loot, organised riots, which M t° looting and destruction of both Government and private property at ^ajaf and Abu Sukhair. The period of open lawlessness passed rapidly, and did leac ^ to mu ^ 1 l rou ble on the part of the tribes, except on the reach between Shmanyah and Samawah, when there was a recrudescence of the practice of taking exorbitant tisyar or blackmail from boats passing up and downstream with goods. Hie experience of later events has shown that the cause of the riots as described above was a mere pretext, and that the incident was only the first of several deliberate attempts to overthrow Government control. About the beginning of January a few troops arrived in Kufah. This did not improve matters. It is probable that their small numbers only confirmed the Najafis in their belief that we were hard-pressed elsewhere, and about the middle of January a cavalry patrol round the walls of Najaf was fired upon from the ‘Amarah quarter, and two casualties resulted. The loyal Shaikhs were summoned to Kufah on the 14th January, in order that they might co-operate and use their influence both to hand over the culprits and to quieten the situation. Atiyah Abu Qulal and Karim ibn Haji Sa‘ad were, however, now openlv inciting the people to rebellion, and an aeroplane which appeared over the city was fired upon from all four quarters. Government officials and the offices in the city were attacked, and the officials were obliged to evacuate the town for Kufah. The arrival of a battalion of troops at Kufah, however, improved the situation; and ‘Atiyah and Karim, failing to rouse the people and seeing the obvious intention • of Government to take energetic action, on the night of the 19th bolted with a few armed men. The result of these events was the imposition of a fine of Rs. 50,000 and 500 rifles on the town, and a demand for the surrender of ‘Atiyah and Karim, who were declared outlaws. In default, the town was to be blockaded at once. The Shaikhs were made responsible for the payment of the fine. Here, again, the result was unfortunate, as the Shaikhs at once used their power to exact large sums of money from those of the population who were wealthy and innocent, and finally paid over the fine, not one penny of which had they paid themselves, and the required quantity of old and useless rifles. ‘Atiyah and Karim were not in the town, so the last condition was waived. Capt. Marshall arrived in Najaf as A.P.O. on 1st February, and took up his residence in ‘Atiyah’s Khan outside the walls, which had been confiscated to Government when he was declared an outlaw. Events outwardly progressed quietly, considerable reforms were introduced, and the allowances to the Shaikhs of the town were discontinued. The sole untoward event was the flight of the three sons of ‘Atiyah, after they had promised to go and take up their residence at Baghdad. They were declared outlaws. Rumours, however, as to our imminent defeat and the approach of the Turks again became current. At the same time, the troops at Kufah were withdrawn to Hillah. On the morning of the 19th March, a number of Najafis disguised as Shabanah obtained admittance to ‘Atiyah’s Khan and, after disposing of the sentry, murdered Capt. Marshall and severely wounded the Labour officer who was with him. The Punjabi guard drove out the insurgents. Capt. Balfour arrived from Kufah and entered the town. Though heavily fired upon, he succeeded in evacuating half of the Police, two of whom were shot dead in the bazaar, and the remainder took refuse in the house of Saiyid Mahdi al Saiyid Salman.70 For a week the troops in ‘Atiyah’s Khan were practically isolated; meantime the blockade of the town had been commenced in earnest by a Brigade, and the following conditions had been proclaimed by the G.O.C.-in-Chief : (i) The unconditional surrender of certain persons known to be the ringleaders and supposed to be among the attacking party. (ii) A fine of 1,000 rifles. (iii) A fine of Rs. 50,000/-. tt -i (iv) Deportation of 100 persons to India as prisoners of war. until the above conditions are fulfilled the town will be blockaded and the food and water supply will be cut off. On the 7th April, the Huwaish Mounds dominating the town were taken, and the rest of the Government officials evacuated; and by the 4th May all the important persons named had been surrendered and the blockade was declared at an end. A Military Court was assembled in Kufah to try the offenders. The proceedings of this Court resulted in 11 death sentences and nine sentences of imprisonment varying from life to six years. The incidents connected with the blockade of Najaf may be said to have closed on 25th May, when in the morning the death sentences were carried out at Kufah, while in the afternoon a large assembly in the Kiliddar’s house at Najaf, at which the Civil Commissioner was present, presented Capt. Balfour with a gold sword in commemoration of his having freed the town from its oppressors. Capt. Greenhouse had arrived a few days previously as A.P.O., Najaf. That the town was effectively purged there is no doubt, and it is improbable that under any circumstances whatever the Zuqurt and Shumurt will again be able to exercise their maleficent influence. The proceedings of the Military Court brought to light the fact that the Najaf riot which caused the death of Captain Marshall was but part of a plot to murder all the Political Officers in the neighbourhood—a plot which might easily have succeeded had not the Najafis commenced too soon. The district remained quiet, though at intervals its attitude was doubtful, and the punishment of the guilty persons had an effect as profound amongst the tribes as in the town of Najaf itself. From the beginning of June it has, therefore, been possible to proceed apace with the work of reorganisation and reconstruction throughout the Division. • (6) British Administrative System .—The year 1917 had seen two stages as described above in the British administration of Shamiyah—the first, local autonomy under subsidised Shaikhs; the second, control through Government Agents. The end of 1917 saw the beginning of the third stage—direct control through British Political Officers. The situation at the beginning of the year was Captain Balfour as Political Officer with his headquarters at Kufah, with his Government Agents at Kufah, Najaf and Abu Sukhair. January saw the addition of an A.P.O., Captain Prothero, for Abu Sukhair. At the same time a military occupation was begun, troops being stationed at Kufah. Events in Najaf, however, speedily brought to light the necessity for a greater control of Najaf. Captain Marshall was, therefore, posted as A.P.O. Najaf in February and given a personal guard of a platoon of Punjabis. In matters connected with the town of Najaf he corresponded direct with Baghdad, but in all others was subordinate to the Political Officer, Shamiyah. After the murder of Captain Marshall on 19th March the town underwent a military blockade. Captain Fisher was appointed A.P.O., Kufah, Captain Balfour being engaged as Political Officer with the troops blockading the town. On 23rd May, on the termination of the blockade, Captain Greenhouse was appointed A.P.O., Najaf, his position being analogous to that of the late Captain Marshall, and a British regiment was cantoned just outside the walls of Najaf. On the 6th June Mr. R. E. L. Wingate took over from Captain Balfour as P.O., Shamiyah, with his headquarters at Kufah. The administrative division of Shamiyah at this stage under British control may now be briefly outlined. At Kufah was a Political Officer in charge of the Division as described above. Under him at Kufah was an A.P.O. in charge of the town of Kufah and the two Shu‘bahs of Kufah and Hor al Dukhn, that is roughly of that part of the Division North of Kufah and Abu Shorah; at Abu Sukhair an Assistant Political Officer in charge of all the Divisions South of the line, which71 included the four Shu bahs of Abu Sukhair and Mishkhab on the Mishkhab Channel and Umm al Ba rur and Ghammas on the Shamiyah Channel. At Najaf was an A.P.O. who controlled only the town of Najaf and who, in matters affecting the district, was under the P.O., and, in matters affecting the town, only directly under Baghdad. The desert was under a Government Agent controlled by the Political Officer, Desert, whose headquarters were Bamadi. It soon became apparent, however, that this system, though admirable as a temporary measure after the blockade, could never be efficient as a permanent establishment. Najaf and the district are inextricably bound up. The interest and work of the Kufah. district was centered in Kufah, which is only a suburb of Najaf. The district work of this A.P.O. is insignificant. At the same time unity of control bjr the A.P.O. Abu Sukhair for the whole of the actually district work was imperative. The Political Officer was unable effectively to perform his work without a complete knowledge of Najaf affairs. Najaf is the largest town of the Division and from every association, religious, commercial and administrative, regarded as the capital by the people. On the first of August, therefore, the headquarters of the P.O., Shamiyah, were transferred to Najaf, which was now placed under his direct control. The iLP.O., Kufah, became A.P.O. of the municipal area of Kufah and Najaf, with headquarters also at Najaf, and the two Shu‘bahs of Kufah and Hor al Dukhn were added to the charge of the A.P.O. Abu Sukhair, who remained at Abu Sukhair. To assist the A.P.O. and to decentralise administration as far as possible, a gazetted officer (Part II.), Sarkis Effendi, was posted under the A.P.O. Kufah-Najaf at Kufah as Municipal Officer, and two Deputy A.P.O.s also gazetted officers (Part II.) were posted, one on each river, at Umm al Ba‘rur and Abu Sukhair respectively, to work directly under the A.P.O., Abu Sukhair. Each of these D.A.P.O.s was in administrative charge of the three Shu‘bahs on his river. The Political Officer is assisted by a personal assistant, a Gazetted Officer (Part II.), for Najaf political affairs. Early in August the new administration suffered a serious set-back in the death of Captain Prothero, who had been a whole-hearted supporter of the new plan and upon whose assistance the Political Officer had relied for its successful inception. Ghawi Effendi, however, efficiently carried out the arduous duties of A.P.O. during this critical time till the arrival of Captain Lyell from Qizil Pobat. The celebration of the Armistice also brought Al Qasur (the desert) again under the control of Shamiyah. This is administered by a Government Agent directly under the P.O. On the 1st August Lieut. MacWhinnie took over charge of the Division shabanah, and in October Lieut. White was sent to assist him. Another officer had also been asked for. The Najaf city police, recruited from Baghdad and Kut, are in charge of two British N.C.O.s and are under the A.P.O., Shabanah, for discip linary purposes. From 1st January 1919 they mil, however, form a separate police force subordinate to the Political Officer, but distinct from shabanah. Below is a sketch of the present administration of the district, the figures I. and II. denoting Gazetted Officers, Part I. or II., respectively. Political Officer, Shamiyah, at Najaf (I.). P.A. to P.O., Shamiyah, at Najaf (II.). Government Agent in Charge of Al Qusur (the desert and oases). A.P.O., Kufah-Najaf at Najaf (I.) P.A. to A.P.O. for Najaf (II.).

Mamur and Sub-Mamur, Ghammas.72 It is also capable of indefinite extension without destroying the original structure. The Assistants to the A.P.O.s might well be British officers with deputies under them (somewhat in the nature of the Bevenue Assistant in the Punjab). •The SlnTbahs will almost certainly be increased to eight, and each Mamur will have two Sub-Mamurs instead of one. A tentative scheme based on this assumption is added as an Appendix. It is only necessary to emphasise the paramount necessity of alw r ays having at Najaf a personal assistant to the Political Officer, preferably a Persian, of a good family and well versed in Najaf affairs. Without the presence of such a man it is impossible for the Political Officer to perform some of his most important work. The Future. —To predict or even to suggest this would possibly be considered folly. But in this Division several salient features of future policy are clearly outlined from our experience this year. The first is the security of the supply of water and of irrigation, as upon this depends the prosperity of a wealthy and settled tract. The second is the maximum of direct control by Government, which entails the replacement of confederations by the smaller tribal or sub-tribal unit. This disintegration has already begun and reflects the desires of the people themselves, who are openly averse to the tyranny of the tribal confederation, which places great power in the hands of a chief whom they seldom see,—a power which he usually wields to fill his own pocket and which they know he could not possess but for the support of Government. The third is the opening up of Najaf by increased communications and large municipal improvements. Thus alone will the peculiar attributes of this town become merged in the saner outlook of the rest of ‘Iraq. The fourth is the absolute necessity for the retention of a permanent garrison at Najaf. The control of Najaf in the Euphrates Valley is regarded as the control of the Euphrates Valley. 2. Revenue: (a) Land Revenue; (1) System of Ownership. —Shamiyah, ex cluding Najaf, was originally owned, or rather cultivated with undisputed rights of ownership, by the Zubaid and Khazafil tribes. The Zubaid occupied part of Tajiyah, near Kufah, and the Khaza‘il, who emigrated from the Hijaz some 200 years ago, occupied the remaining part of Tajiyah, Kufah, Hor-al-Duhkn, Umm-al-Ba‘rur, Ghammas, Ja‘arah, Abu Sukhair, and Mishkab. The Turks, however, some 50 or 60 years ago, in order to break the power of the Khazafil, as has been described in the previous chapters, began allotting ,the land to various extraneous tribes and Saiyids. The only lands which remained in the hands of the farmer-owners were a few gardens of Tajiyah, which were left with Wadi, Shaikh of the Zubaid, Ja‘arah, which was left with the Albu Zuwain, who had previously cultivated these lands with the permission of the Khazafil, and a few lands in the neighbourhood of Ghammas in the hands of the fallahin of the Khazafil. Mishkhab was granted to the Fatlah, Kufah, Hor-al-Dukhn, and Salachiyah to the Bani Hasan, and numerous muqata‘ahs to various Saiyids. It does not seem that Tapu had been introduced in ‘Iraq when this revolution in the proprietary rights of Shamiyah took place. The land remained definitely amiriyah, paying the full miri share, and the condition of occupation was cultivation and payment of this share. Failure to pay meant immediate eviction, and the Shaikh himself was at full liberty to evacuate the land himself. The extreme fertility of the soil, however, did not make the latter contingency probable, and Saiyid or Shaikh, unable to exercise effective supervision over his enormous tracts and afraid that possibly uncultivated portions might be granted to someone else, divided his lands amongst the heads of his family, keeping a portion for himself. By agreement these original heads of families, now known as Sarkals, have the same rights to their land as their chiefs. This form of ownership, known as tribal or saiyid ownership, is thus nothing more than a lease, the condition of which is the payment of the miri share of 40 per cent, every year. Failure to pay this or to cultivate and use all the land entitles Government to terminate the lease. In practice, Government seldom, if ever interfered, and the Shaikh or Saiyid was in reality landlord. Almost all land in Shamiyah is so owned, the sole difference between the Shaikh and the Saiyid being that in the former case the cultivators came from one tribe in the latter from many. There is very little tapu in the Division. (2) Responsibility of Saiyid, Shaikh, or Sarkal to Government.—It will be seen from the above that in the case of all land not tapu, the Saiyid, the Shaikh or the Sarkal is directly responsible to Government for the payment of revenue.A Shaikh or a Saiyid may say he has so many Sarkals, but each of these is responsible to Government, as, directly or indirectly, he has become the lessee of Government land, and the Shaikh or Saiyid has no share in the produce of such Sarkals, except in so far as he may have financed their crop by private arrangement. Perhaps this condition of affairs, which is often misunderstood, may be best explained by imagining the Government as tapu owner of all land for which private persons are not tapu owners. All land can now ba considered tapu. The owner of the tapu is the mallak, the person responsible for cultivation is the sarkal, the cultivator is the fallah. In tribally-owned land the Government is mallak, the shaikh or any of his sarkals is the sarkal, and the cultivator is the’ fallah. When a sarkal actually cultivates himself he is both sarkal and fallah. Hence has arisen in Shamiyah what is for ‘Iraq an unusual phenomenon—the peasant proprietor— as many Sarkals are their own fallah s and pay directly to Government. In tapu lands, of course, the tapu owner is the mallak, and is responsible for the payment of all taxes. (3) Relations between the Sarkal, that is, Saiyid, Shaikh, or Sarkal, in Miri Land, and the Fallah. —As a general rule under the Turkish regime a Sarkal took three- fifths of the crop, from which he paid the miri share, and the fallah two-fifths. Since the reduction of the Government share to one-third the Sarkal takes two- thirds and the fallah one-third. In miri gardens the Sarkal takes two-thirds or three-quarters and the fallah one-third or one quarter respectively, as the agreement may be. The fallah provides seed; if he cannot, the sarkal provides seed on loan, to be recovered in kind at the time of harvest, according to the terms of the agreement. The fallah is also responsible for opening the canals, and failure to do this entitles the Sarkal to discharge him. I do not fully agree with Mr. Garbett when he remarks in his Revenue note : “ The district presents instances of every variety of tribal tenure, together with a new feature, the muqata‘ahs of Saiyids.” As will be seen from the description in the preceding paragraphs, both Saiyid and tribal tenure in Sham^ah are the same. (4) Tapu. —There is very little agricultural tapu land in the Division, the reason being given that the Shaikhs and Saiyids feared that the registration of their lands as tapu would make them liable for military service. The only two estates are Muwaihi in Hor-al-Dukhn, owned in partnership by Manahim Daniel and the family of the Kiliddar of Najaf, and Rughailah on the Shamiyah, owned by the family of the Kiliddar and that of Hafiz Pasha of Constantinople. A considerable number of gardens are, however, registered as tapu, though for the same reason as was operative in the case of agricultural land the majority are still miri. Apparently on first introducing the tapu system the Turks used to give one deed for every garden, but later issued a notice that two deeds were required, known as Zamin and Ash jar, for the land and the trees respectively. There are a few gardens for which two such deeds exist. In most cases the mallak employs a Sarkal, who is in reality his agent, though occasionally he is Sarkal himself, that is, manages directly, and in a very few instances is fallah as well. (5) Relations between Mallak, Sarkal, and Fallah on Tapu Land. —These relations are somewhat complicated. In Tapu Sih (flow) lands the Mallak takes half of the crops of shitwi and saifi, other than rice, and the fallah takes the other half. From the half the mallak takes he pays the Government tax and a certain amount to his Sarkal, if he has any, as agreed between them on the appointment of the Sarkal. In Kurud lands the mallak takes one-seventh of the crops and pays from the one-seventh the Government tax, and the remaining six-sevenths are shared between the Sarkar and the fallah. The Sarkal has to provide machinery and animals, &amp;c., and the fallah has to provide seed, and if he has no seed he takes the seed from the Sarkal or Mallak on loan. In Tapu gardens the Mallak takes two-thirds of the yield and the fallah one- third. From the two-thirds the Mallak takes, he pays the Government tax, and pays to his Sarkal, if he has any, a certain share agreed to on the appointment of the Sarkal. The Mallak in the case of gardens has to provide pumps, oil, and the animals required for the Karad.74 The muqata’ahs of Ja‘arah and Mishkhab are Sanniyah, that is, tapn of the Sultan (on the revolution transferred to the State as mudawarrah). They contain magnificent gardens, and how the Sultan acquired them as he certainly made no payment, when under Turkish law any tree planted if not claimed by the State after three years becomes the property of the planter, is not known.

The method of assessment of the Government share has been very fully described by Mr. Garbett in his land revenue note on the division, and has been successfully employed in the estimation of the 1918 crops. The rates of yield have proved remarkably accurate by comparison with crop experiments made on land put by the estimators in the various classes. (8) Shitwi of 1918.—-The Shamiyah Division, except in the North, is not a spring crop area. The disastrous rice crop of 1917 and the assistance given by the A D. Scheme in cash loans for the purchase of seed alike impelled the Shaikhs to considerable efforts for the spring crop of 1918. These efforts were successful in so far as a spring crop far larger than had ever been seen before in Shamiyah was produced, but considerable loss occurred through flood, and in some cases cultivators have been discouraged from giving this year owing to the bad effect the shitwi has had on their saih land. The demands were 418 tons of wheat and 2,975 tons of barley, which were remarkably promptly paid, all revenue being in by the end of August. Had it not been for damage from flood there would certainly have been another 500 tons of Government share while it must be admitted that the size of the Division and the political events of the time probably mitigated against a very full or accurate assessment in the lower half of the Division. ' te Ne x t year it is confidently anticipated that the Revenue share will be over R000 tons which, it is to be hoped, will be taken in cash and not in kind The latter system is almost an intolerable burden on the cultivator and was'rarely employed by the Turks, except in the Sanniyah estates. Theoretically they took75 &lt;-2 M in kind, but actually through the medium of merchants, who paid cash to the Govern ment and brought in in the open market in the fields themselves, the iltizam or farm. Dukhun is considered a spring crop in Shamiyah and produced a revenue of Rs. 16,517/-, the conversion rate being Rs. 100/- per ton. (9) Surmner Crop of 1918.—This is, of course, rice, though haricots, sesame, millet, and mash are also grain. The revenue on these latter was taken in cash, and amounted in round figures to Rs. 95,000/-. The rice crop was a failure : fear of lack of water restricted the area to be sown; actual lack of water damaged the sown area, and, finally, unexpected heavy rain severely damaged the just harvested crop. Before the rain the Government share had been estimated at approximately 5,000 tons, but the second estimation, under taken after the rain, reduced the assessment to 4,100 tons. This will probably all be paid in kind by the end of January. There is no doubt that lack of water caused a loss of probably 1,000 tons of Government share in addition, owing to actual death through draught or poor yield. Had the crop matured well we should have got 6,000 tons. Had we from the beginning got our full share of summer water we should have had at least 20,000 tons. Next year 5,000 tons of Government share is estimated, as in the case of shitwi to be taken in cash. It is impossible to be sanguine after the bitter experiences of last year. (10) Date Crop .—The tax on date-trees (see para. 6) varies considerably, and is absurdly low. This year’s crop was a fine one, except in some parts of the Kufah Shu‘bah, and resulted in a revenue of Rs. 95,000/-. There are a very large number of young trees in the district, which must be the richest in ‘Iraq outside Basrah. With more accurate methods of counting which it is hoped to devise before next harvest and the increase due to the bearing of the young trees, Rs. 1,20,000/- is expected as revenue. An all-round tax of 8 annas a tree would result in 2J lakhs of revenue from this source. (11) Vegetable Tax .—The various times at which portions of the district came under control, our lack of knowledge, political events, and the generally unsatisfactory nature of this tax alike made collection difficult. Collections amounted to Rs. 50,000/-. In the district the usual system of farming was pursued; but in Najaf, during the vegetable season, the tax was collected direct in the ‘alwah— the great vegetable growing districts are Ruhabah and Ruhaimah in the desert. This had surprising results, over Rs. 11,000/-being collected, while the highest bid for the farm was Rs. 6,000/-, an interesting sidelight on the fact that direct control always pays even though Mamurs are probably dishonest. Next year the system of direct collection in the ‘alwahs at the place of sale is being adopted throughout the Division, and the estimate for the year is Rs. 80,000/- (12) Land Revenue in 1919-20.—The land revenue share of 37 per cent, is clearly excessive, and the theory of paying back one-tenth of this to the responsible revenue payer, eminently unsound. There are too many responsible revenue payers in Shamiyah, and Government should well be able to look after its own interests without having to pay non-officials to help. It is recommended that the demand be reduced to one-third on miri land and that this be taken in cash at a reasonable conversion rate. The somewhat clumsy system of assessment will still have to be followed, as a fixed revenue rate per masharah must await security of irrigation and tenure. Karads are too few to warrant the placing of a fixed assessment on Karad land. (b) Tapu .—The Tapu ownership of agricultural and garden land has already been dealt with under “ Land Revenue.” For most of Najaf and Kufah house propertv, Tapu deeds are possessed, and if staff is available a start might well be made with the registration of this property. The registration of agricultural and garden property should await an accurate land settlement. (c) Waqf .—The only Waqfs in the Division are the Shi‘ah Waqfs of Najaf and Kufah. ' Outside these towns there is no waqf property, though there is a certain amount of property in the hands of Mujtahids, who administer it in the cause of charity. The money distributed by the Mujtahids of Najaf comes under a different 'heading and has been fully described in the note on the Municipality of Najaf. P 476 The income of the Shi £ ah Waqfs of Najaf and Kufah arises from the Dafaniyah or burial tax on bodies over three years old brought for burial in the Wadi al Salam or in the shrine! The fees are as follows :— For ordinary burial outside the town, Rs. 6/4/- a corpse. This tax is extremely lucrative, and has produced in the year under review the sum of Rs. 48,000/-, and this though the blockade intervened and the restrictions on the corpse traffic were considerable. Next year the income from this source should be at least Rs. 1,20,000/-. As has been explained elsewhere a quarantine tax of Rs. 4/- per corpse is levied on all corpses, new or old, brought in for burial. This produces a sum even greater than the Dafaniyah. Collection is carried out by the Auqaf agency; half the salary of the Auqaf administrative establishmnet is, therefore, borne from general revenue, into which the quarantine tax is credited. The income of the Darwaish Estate in the Hindiyah district is dedicated to the Shrine of ‘Ali, and a little house property in Najaf and Kufah and a mill are also owned by the Auqaf. The income accruing from this is, however, only between * 3,000 and 4,000 rupees a year. The expenditure of the Auqaf consists in the salaries of the Auqaf administrative establishment, consisting of a Mamur, clerk, burial inspectors and qolchis. This is 750/- per mensem, of which half is borne from general revenues. The salaries of the mosque and shrine officials at Najaf and Kufah, 768/12/- per mensem; oil for lighting the shrines, 240/- per mensem; the upkeep of the kanat or underground water channel which was built as a charitable endowment for the benefit of the city—this costs 240-/ per mensem, of which 125/- per mensem is supplied by the gardeners at the foot of the cliff, who derive considerable benefit from it. Even with these expenses and with a very low estimate for the receipts of the Dafaniyah tax there is a surplus of receipts over expenditure of over Rs.'4,000/- per mensem. With this large accumulating surplus it has been possible to undertake what is the primary duty of the Auqaf, the repair and upkeep of the shrines and mosques themselves. The number of these in Kufah and Najaf is very large. Rs. 9,300/- has been sanctioned for these repairs, which include the repair of the great Kufah mosque, urgent sanitary work and minor repairs in the shrine and repairs to the Shrine of Zain al ‘Abdin and the tomb of Hud and Salih. The two latter have been satisfactorily completed, while work on the two first should be finished shortly. There is no doubt that the waqfs of Najaf and Kufah are in a very flourishing state, and that a very bright future, from the financial standpoint, lies before them. A great deal of the present successful administration is due to the work of the Mamur, Saiyid Mahdi, who has shown himself exceedingly capable and hardworking, and who, incidentally, underwent a far from pleasant experience during the blockade when he succeeded in saving some Rs. 11,000/- of Auqaf funds from the hands of the insurgents. There are no Sunni Waqfs in the Division, though there are Sunni mosques at Kufah and Umm al Ba‘rur. The object of these institutions was however propaganda by the Turks, and the salaries of the officials are borne by Government’ (d) Miscellaneous Revenues : Kodak.—The Division is exceptionally rich in sheep and cattle, and the revenue from this source in the year under review amounted to over Rs 80,000/-. The system was adopted of making certain shaikhs responsible tor the collection and the result was successful. Next year the usual system of special mamurs will be employed if the SlnTbah staff are not able to manage. Quarantine.—This is an extremely lucrative tax, and incidentally a thoroughly justifiable one, of 4/- on all corpses brought from outside for burial at m-jo-F ff Rs. Tarmah Hu j rah Rawaq Sahn 25/-/- 62/8/- 31/4/- 750/-/-the administration of this tax did not begin till June. Next year Rs. 1,20,000/- is anticipated from this source. Fish Tax .—This is farmed and produced Rs. 14,086/-. Other Miscellaneous Taxes .—These are the taxes on wood, reeds, mats, tobacco licences, brick kilns, tombak, fruit trees, stamps, &amp;c. The revenue from these sources was approximately Rs. 40,000/-. (e) Customs. —Nil. (f) Compensation .—Compensation amounting to approximately a lakh of rupees has been paid in the Division. Of this Rs. 98,924/-, of which all but Rs. 1,325/- has been paid, was sanctioned owing to damage in Najaf caused b;y necessary demolitions, carried out under orders of the Military authorities. There are a certain amount of petitions still remaining, which will be dealt with as soon as possible, and which may result in a small amount of additional compensation 3. Irrigation. —The Irrigation Division of Shamiyah does not entirely correspond with the Political Division, being somewhat smaller. It extends from Kid in the North and includes the two branches known as the Shamiyah Channel on the East and the Mishkhab Channel on the West. These two join about 40 miles South, but their junction is effected by the Shamiyah Channel breaking up into five or six streams, which flow into the Mishkhab Channel. There is therefore an island about 40 miles long, and varying from 7 to 1 mile wide. The island is intersected by canals from both branches of the river, the centre of the island in the South forming a natural drainage line from North to South. Canals have been freely cut from the right bank of* the Mishkhab and the left bank of the Shamiyah by the inhabitants for purposes of cultivation, regardless of water. The canals from the left bank of the Shamiyah in the North drain into the succession of hors known as the Hor ibn Najm, the drainage line of which runs North and South, and which flow out into the river again below Umm al Ba‘rur. The canals from the right bank of the Mishkhab drain into the Hor Sulaib and other hors, which escape again into the river by Turumah. The irrigation district therefore consists of about 800 square miles of intensely irrigated land; this latter characteristic is one that is frequently forgotten, and is of supreme importance. Secondly, the district is very thickly populated with a settled population; thirdly, it is exceedingly fruitful, a veritable garden of ‘Iraq, and, fourthly, arising out of the above, it boasts several large municipalities, which are increasiog in size and importance in proportion as the safety of travelling ensures increase of trade. These four points must not be lost sight of, as it is precisely these which distinguish Shamiyah from any other Division in ‘Iraq. The purpose of irrigation being to ensure the maximum amount of cultivation with the greatest economy of water, the position must be shortly reviewed in three stages : before the war, during the war but previous to control, and under control. The staple product of Shamiyah is essentially rice, though now the cultivation of wheat and barley is increasing rapidly. It was the invariable custom in pre-war times to allow all the water from the Euphrates down the Kill branch by closing the barrage against the Hillah branch, except for such spare water as there might be for a period of six months. This ensured a regular rice crop, which in a good year amounted to 90,000-100,000 tons. At the commencement of this system the Shamiyah branch was much smaller than the Mishkhab. Previous to the erection of the barrage the whole of the Euphrates poured down the Hindiyah branch summer and winter, and it was to restore the prosperity of the Hillah branch, at the same time securing the cultivation on the Hindiyah, that the barrage was erected. Some 40 years ago the main channel of the Hindiyah branch, which was the whole of the Euphrates, was, below Kid, the present Kufah or Mishkhab channel. This, instead of taking the sharp bend to the Eastward at Turumah which it now does, continued in a course considerably to the westward, which is now shown in the maps as the Khasif spill channel. The bed of this Khasif channel is firm and not easily scourable. At Kifi, ‘and at some place below Turumah, were two canals, taking off the main river, the first the present Shamiyah channel, the second which flows past78 ►Shinafiyah the present bed of the river. These canals were comparatively small— it is a known fact that a bridge of four boats spanned the canal at Shinafiyah. Unfortunately both these canals were aligned through bad ground, while the original bed of the river, certainly in the Khasif, and it seems probable in the Mishkhab, is firm ground. The inevitable happened—a larger flood than usual, a rapid scour and the river ook the easier course down the two canals. Which occurred first it is not necessary to go into. Suffice it to say that the Shamiyah canal very rapidly became the mam bed of the river, and the scour of the river bed shortly caused rapids, once elow Shinafiyah and yearly working up-stream. This naturally accelerated the scour in the Shamiyah channel, which slowly changed into the main bed instead of the Mishkhab. Thus the scouring of the Shamiyah channel and the soft bed soil of the river below Turumah have completely altered former conditions. The OW ? o 10 khamiyah increases annually, the rapids work up annually between ,000 and ^,000 feet. The result is evident: an increase in slope such that the wa er m the two channels is now drawn off at such a rate that cultivation is becoming of increasing difficulty. It was no doubt reasons due to these causes and also to the lack of instruction m modern methods of cultivation, that induced the Arab to produce rice in the way that he now does This must be briefly described, as it produces another factor winch has to be considered by any irrigation scheme. From the river bed canals are made (distributaries) with small feeders running over the fields. The land is divided up into squares of about 250 square yards” each one enclosed by a bund. At the time of flood, the water from the feeder is let on to each individual square, where it rests until such time as the silt has settled. When this process is completed the water, minus the silt, is run off into large drainage canals known as bazals which, finding their own level, make for the natural l3° in TL / he ° utpouri * lg of innumerable bazals into a restricted area has resulted m the formation of large lakes knows as “ hors.” Many of these bazals are as large as the mam distributaries, which will give some idea of the immense of m water 18 pUt ° n to the rice fields ’ and also incidentally of the wastage whioUto S r s eX^oLme e s ?!i Sting ^ “ the ligation Department had on (1) A fruitful and thickly populated district.

The former scheme of sending all the water down Shamiyah in the summer, all down the Hillah barrage in the winter ensured two good crops, and it was in accordance with the only methods of rice cultivation known to the cultivators. The scheme put into practice by the Directorate was to distribute the water by rotation, closing the barrage against Hindiyah for one week and sending all water down the Hillah branch, and vice versa, it apparently being hoped there would be sufficient summer water to mature rice crops on both the Hillah and Hindiyah. This no doubt sounds an equitable division, in theory, but in practice it was the reverse. Actually the rotation worked out as eight days in favour of Hillah and six days in favour of Shamiyah. In almost every case when the time came for the Shamiyah rotation, only partial rotation was given, possibly owing to the claims of navigation down the Hillah Branch. , From careful readings of levels it was found that only the first day of the rotation was of any practical value to the rice crop. It was fortunate in one sense that the Shaikhs, owing to their very bitter experience in 1917, sowed not more than one-eighth of the usual area, and this produced a very poor crop owing to the lack of water. The Shamiyah population were and are naturally gravely suspicious of anything suggested by the Irrigation Department. Indeed the peaceful individual might question the wisdom of a policy that deprived him in one year of 99-|- of his income. The problem that faced the Irrigation Department was how to insure a good rice crop, reclaim the flooded land, make the Mishkhab a navigable channel and prevent the Shamiyah Branch from taking change. The following were the works proposed for 1918-19 :— The Shamiyah Channel .—The restriction of the Shamiyah Channel by a dam at the North, the Naqah with a bye-pass. The water would be held up to the necessary level for irrigation on that branch by hamals or dams with a gap in the centre. Three of these were to be built. The river was also to be restricted by spurs running out below the bye-pass, forcing the water into a narrower channel. Flood banks to be built from the Naqah Dam Northwards to the fork which would protect the island in time of flood. The Mishkhab Channel .—Strong flood protection banks were to be built from Kifl to Kufah and Kufah to Abu Sukhair. A new canal, the Chihat, was to be dug from Abu Sukhair running parallel to the river about half a mile inland on the right bank, and discharging into the river about 5 miles above Shinafiyah. The left bank of this canal would form the right protective flood bank of the river. A bund was to be built across the south of the Hor al Sulaib where it discharges into the river, forcing the water down the natural drainage line. All canals discharging into the Hor al Sulaib were to be closed. The head of the Chihat Canal would have a masonry regulator. The greatly increased flow of water down the Mishkhab which would have been secured by the completion of these works would, it was hoped, result in a considerable scour of the bed of the channel, making it navigable at all seasons of the year. At the same time the general drop in the level of the bed of the river would gradually eliminate the rapids. This drop in the bed-level would again make irrigation by canals direct from the Mishkhab impossible. The Chihat, which was to be a high level canal taking off from Abu Sukhair, above which point the river apparently will not scour, would replace the original direct irrigation from the river. A similar canal was projected some time in the future for the left bank of the Mishkhab. Irrigation would be secured on the Shamiyah channel by turning it into a succession of locked reservoirs, into which water could be let by the regulator at the Naga Dam. The actual works completed are :— Three dams on the Shamiyah channel. Had it been possible to carry out all these works there is no doubt that they would have accomplished their object as stated above. But they were projected at a time when the District was comparatively unknown and under the assumption that it was similar to any other District.80 To complete the work at least 12,000 labourers daily are required, and, being Arabs, probably 15,000 would be nearer the mark. This from a settled population of cultivators was impossible. The scheme involved a complete revolution of all known methods of cultivation and irrigation, and this is a District famous for its turbulence. Further previous efforts of the Directorate had had such an effect on the rice crop that the Arab wrongly, but naturally, considered anything proposed by them as impracticable and dangerous. The new Chihat canal was the main item in the general scheme: among many others the following objections to it were among the most important. That the construction would involve the probable loss of about Rs. 5,00,000/- of real property. That the level of the water-table was so high that the men constructing it would in some places be working with the water over their heads. Then considerable doubts were felt by the local Arabs as to whether the river bed would scour sufficiently. If it did not, enormous loss would have been involved. The whole of the left bank of the Mishkhab would have been put out of cultivation. After many protests the scheme was eventually given up. It is to be sincerely hoped that the immediate future will be productive of a comprehensive and workable scheme, which will not be undertaken until such time as proper surveys have been carried out and a closer acquaintance has been made with the local Arab and his point of view. If a suggestion may be allowed, it would j)robably be found that an Arab-speaking staff will be able to do infinitely more than the present, whose linguistic qualifications are limited to Hindustani. It is to be hoped, further, that all ideas of making the Mishkhab into a navigable channel are entirely abolished. There is no longer any immediate necessity for them. The country is now at peace, and the crying need for facilitating all means of transport has ceased to exist. At the same time new railways are being built up to the line of the Euphrates, and it is certain that these will in a very short time be the main means of transport for trade. Further, even should it be desirable to establish an auxiliary river transport, it must not be forgotten that both the Military and the Civil authorities have over and over again emphasised in war time that agricultural interests must first be procured. Assuming therefore that the navigation of the Mishkhab is not pressed, how can the cultivation of Shamiyah be assured in the future ? The answer seems to be in the direction of returning to former conditions, that is, turning the present artificial flow below Turumah and past Shinafiyah back into its original course down the Khasif. The existence of the rapids, working up as they are, is a grave danger, and the possibility of the Shamiyah channel taking change is even graver. &amp; The scour down the latter depends largely on the former. Could a means be found to silt up the rapids, it would automatically remedy the danger from the Shamiyah channel. , Thi s was recognised even by the inept brain of the Turkish Administration, who, no less than three times, started a scheme to erect a dam at Shinafiyah, thereby holding up all the water from Kifl downwards, which would have the immediate effect of restoring the status quo ante. The present flow would be again turned down the original bed of the Khasif rapids would silt up, and the whole situation automatically solve itself. Further ? such a scheme would have the whole-hearted support of the entire tribal population rri if 1 « du ™g the Turkish time was only due to their innate corruption The last effort almost succeeded, but finally the Wall of Baghdad and the Daftardar failed to agree on the exact division of Turkish liras 25,000; hence it went the wav of most progressive schemes which the Turks undertook. ^ Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the intimate connection between irrigation and political interests. It is particularly desirable in a District like Shamiyah with its. arge settled population and its cultivation, and no opportunitv should be missed of an interchange of views which would be of the greatest value f her t,. + i ? n ,° C 1 l , oubt tha . t ' 1 wit h greater coordination and more detailed survey than has hitherto been possible scientific irrigation will increase by many hundred per cent the fruitfulness of this tract, but it is abundantly necessary to go slow A tl0 , ugb ‘&lt; lllck brained, is intensely conservative and violent changes in methods forced upon him are neither advisable nor justifiable. ngesThe scheme, some sort of barrage at Shinafiyah if practicable, is clearly one which cannot mature for a few years. In the immediate future therefore a reversion should be made to the Turkish system of giving the summer water to Shamiyah as the winter water is even more given to Hillah. With such an arrangement alone can cultivation be secured and certain political difficulties averted. If the Political Officer may finally voice a suggestion, it is that the whole irrigation of the Euphrates Valley is of great difficulty, needing immense study and accurate survey, so that a system may be evolved which will benefit the cultivable area throughout. It is impossible and impolitic to project schemes which may give great advantages to one area, but which may drive some other area, about which by chance little happens to be known, out of cultivation. 4. Agriculture.— This falls naturally into three heads: gardens, winter crops, and summer crops. Gardens. —These are possibly the finest in ‘Iraq. They border both banks of the Western Channel, extending from North of Kufah to Turumah and up the entire length of the Eastern Channel, with the exception of a small strip of land between Umm A1 Ba‘rur and Ghammas. They also run along to the sides of every large canal, particularly in the North-East portion of the District. They extend to an average depth of about half to three-quarters of a mile on each side. The most famous are the Ja‘arah date-gardens, about 90 years old, and about 10 square miles in area, of magnificent trees. The date count last year showed that there were not less than 1,000,000 trees in the District. Over a lakh of rupees were produced on the tax, which in this area is taken at the lowest rate. There are two main divisions of dates in Shamiyah : Zehdi and Khastauwi. The former is by far the most common, comprising 60 per cent, of the total yield. It is a moderate size fruit, yellow in colour, large stone, and at present sells at about Rs. 180/- per ton. From this kind is distilled ‘Araq. Khastauwi is both a genus and the name of a particular date. It may not be out of place to mention a few of the main kinds, all included under this comprehensive title. Khastauwi. —Small yellow fruit, slightly pear-shaped, with a very small stone. The date mostly eaten by the upper classes. Sold at Rs. 360/- per ton. ‘Amrani. —A long thin yellow fruit, small stone, yielding about one waznah per tree. Sells at Rs. 240/- per ton. Shakar. —Thicker and smaller than the former. So named because if left in a dish for about 10 hours sugar crystals form on the skins. Sells at Rs. 240/- per ton. Barhan. —A fat red fruit. Only sold when absolutely fresh. It will never keep. Large stone. Sells at Rs. 240/-. Ibrahimi. —As the former, but a darker red and a much thicker skin. Sells at Rs. 210/-. Halawi. —A very thin, pear-shaped fruit, yellow; large stone. Sells at Rs. 220 /-. Tuparyai. —A large round fruit, yellow; moderate stone. Only eaten when fresh. Never stored. Sells at Rs. 210/-. Maqtun. —A very excellent sweet date, yellow; long and cylindrical in shape; a large stone. It is cut and eaten before it is fully ripe and kept in bundles. Sells at Rs. 420/- per ton. Ashrasi. —Of two kinds. The best date of all, like Maqtun but slightly pear- shaped. Very sweet. Sells at Rs. 420/- per ton. There are other kinds, but these are the most common. The fructification of the female trees takes place during March and April, the fruit beginning to appear in June and July, and the harvest is gathered during October. Irrigation is both by flow and lift in accordance with local conditions. As a general rule it is calculated that each tree requires to be surrounded by water, for about a yard from the trunk, of about 1 foot deep. Once a week is sufficient. The younger trees require more water. It is possible for an old tree to bear fruit even if it has not received water for one year, though the yield is very adversely affected afterwards.82 The Shamiyah date does not appear to suffer much from disease. Sometimes the tree overgrows its strength and produces a greater weight of fruit than it can stand, when part of the yield is cut away before it ripens. Were this not done, the tree would never yield again. The enormous profits from date-growing to the agriculturist may be seen at a glance. In Shamiyah alone the sale proceeds from the total crop in one year would approximate Rs. 2,74,00,000. The expenses are practically nil. Included in the garden cultivation is the vegetable and fruit produce. These include carrots, radishes, pumpkins, beetroot, tomatoes, cucumber, ladies’-fingers, French beans, baqalah, turnips, onions, and other kinds. Among the fruits the most common are dates and oranges, peaches, apricots, lemons, limes, sweet limes, figs, grapes, pomegranates, melons and water-melons. The revenue from the vegetable and fruit cultivation is estimated annually at about Rs. 70,000/-, which represents a net value of vegetables sold in the Division as 3,50,000. Probably a greater amount is exported than imported, and, including the amount consumed by garden owners, four lakhs would probably more nearly represent the annual sale. Winter Crops .—These comprise wheat, barley and dukhn. Shamiyah was never a great winter crop area, the majority of cultivators devoting all their energies to rice. Since our administration, however, wheat and barley cultivation has been encouraged, and it is calculated that this year 35,000 masharahs are under culti vation. The main shitwi area lies north of a line drawn between Abu Sukhair and Umm al Bahur, and on the left bank of the Shamiyah Channel from Naqah to Umm al Ba‘rur. In the southern part of this area the irrigation is by flow, and in the northern by lift. In the year under review 3,209 masharas of wheat were sown, and 22,500 masharas barley. Of dukhn, the only other winter grain, about 1,300 masharahs were sown. This represents a total sown area of 27,000 masharahs. A good deal of encouragement has been given to the Arabs, and it is hoped that this year, as stated above, at least 35,000 masharahs will be put under shitwi cultivation. Four kinds of wheat are grown in Shamiyah, known respectively as ShafTah, Jodhariyah, Muahairimah and Suboqalan. Of these, the first is the best and is the most largely sown. There is about an 8 per cent, difference in price between the three. The fourth is a curious type, known as Suboqalan wheat, which is in reality half wheat seed and half barley seed, but is always classed as wheat. It is very much cheaper than the other types of wheat referred to. Only one kind of barley is sown in any quantity, known as Rawi, a white thick seed. There is a little sown of what is known as Aswad, as its name implies a black seed, but which is considered by the Arabs as infinitely superior. However, in Shamiyah the shitwi crop is a mere side show compared to the summer crops. Of these the most important is rice, though sesame, millet and mash are also sown to some extent. Dealing with the latter first, the masharas sown from which the revenue was taken during this year were as under :— Sesame - Mash Millet An assurance of a proper water supply will certainly by 200 per cent, in the case of the above. 741 masharahs. 3,000 1,300 increase the area sown -The staple product of Shamiyah, and the main source Summer Crops : Rice.- of land revenue. There are three kinds of rice sown, known as Ambar, Na‘imah and Hawazawi They are named m order of quality. Ambar is a small white grain with Jed paddy. It is only used by the Arab for important guests and is highly valued IVaWo—-The principal food of the population. The grain and the paddj are white, the former coarse and large. &amp; pauayHawazawi .—Grain red and paddy white. It is used by the very poorest for food, and is generally made up into a kind of bread exceedingly unpalatable. The method of rice cultivation is probably the worst that could be conceived. It is exceedingly wasteful of water and thoroughly bad for the land. But it is of such importa-nce that a certain amount of detail must be gone into. After the rice harvest has been completely gathered, the fallah at once begins to prepare the ground for the next sowings. This is done by dividing the land up into innumerable squares of about 225 square yards each, separated from each other by small banks of earth of about 1^ feet high. Between each line of squares is made a small drain about 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep, leading direct from one canal into what appears to be another canal. The land thus prepared—and when ready it appears like a gigantic chess-board —the fallah waits for the floods. At the first flood, the water flows down the small drain, but is prevented at the first square from continuing its course, it being turned into that square. An aperture is made in each bank so that the silt-laden water may flow from the first square to the last down that line. When it is standing on all, to a depth of about 1 foot, the banks are repaired, and the water stopped from the canal. It remains standing on the land for a period varying from a week to a month in accordance to the amount of silt in the water. At the correct moment an opening is made from each square into the drain direct, and the water, deprived of all silt, flows down into the main drain, for this is what many of the so-called canals are in reality, and it goes to form the inland lakes or “ hors ” which are so marked a characteristic of this district. After a period varying from two to six weeks we have, therefore, a silt-laden country. In the meantime the ambar seed has been planted and specially tended on high ground. It is owing to this and the difficulties attending the initial stages of its cultivation that there is so little. The moment the water is drained off, the ambar is pulled up, made into bundles known as “ Hazmah,” and taken to the rice fields proper, where it is planted. Na‘imah and Hawazawi are both sown direct on the silt, though, in the case of the former, a better crop is gathered if it is first sown in the nursery. It is not, however, essential, and in fact is not often done. The majority of the rice land is below the level of the river, and the effect on the land will be considered in due course. In former years it is on record that a good crop averaged between 90,000 and 100,000 metric tons, which represents an area sown of about 120,000 masharahs. During the year 1918-19 the following was the area sown and the crop gathered :— Masharahs. Crop. Ambar - Bafimah Hawazawi - 84 - 22,200 960 Tons. 50 14,430 672 Kilos. 682 420 246 23,244 15,153 348 The reason for this reduction in the area sown was due to the suspicion entertained by the Arab as to the activities of the Irrigation Directorate. As it happened their fears were fully borne out, for the average yield per mashara was very low. The principal objection to this method of rice cultivation, from an agricultural standpoint, is the effect that it has on the soil. The perennial heavy flooding, and draining off, has caused an alteration of level in the main drainage lines, with the result that immense lakes are formed with no means of egress for the water. Further, most of the land is below the level of the river, and the wasteful pouring of water on the land has caused a rise in the level of the water table till in some places it is only 6 inches below the surface. The ground being so waterlogged has become riddled with saltpetre, and it is doubtful if, under any conditions, a really good crop, such as was gathered in former years, may be expected unless radical alteration in methods is made.84 Arising from the water-logged condition of the ground, a further danger has arisen, threatening entirely to destroy the rice fields. This is a weed known as “ silhau,” a creeping water grass, which forms a tangled net over the whole surface of the field where it is in evidence. It is purely a surface growth, the roots extending possibly 1 foot to 2 feet below surface, but it effectually stops any cultivation. No plough would deal with it, and it is a serious menace to the future. The opinion of the local Arab is borne out by the Agricultural experts who visited this area, that the only way of killing it is to smother it. To bring the rice fields of Shamiyah to their highest productive capacity it would be necessary to enforce a rest for two years at least and possibly three. This time might profitably be spent in surveying the land, teaching the Arabs new methods, carrying out irrigation schemes, and generally preparing for a renewal of cultivation on modern lines. Enough has been said above to show that, even under the most adverse con ditions, the title of the “ garden of ‘Iraq ” is not wholly undeserved by Shamiyah. With a suitable system of irrigation, the future is a very bright one. Without undue exaggeration, there is probably no tract of land in ‘Iraq that will so well reward the expert of the future. 5. Municipalities.— The municipalities of the Division are at present five, Najaf, Kufah, Ja‘arah (included in which is Abu Sukhair), Umm al Ba‘rur and Ghammas. This represents the order of their size and importance. The popu lation of Najaf is estimated at 45,000; of Kufah at 7,000; of Ja‘arah at 6,000, though with the garden population dependent on it the figure is probably nearer 10,000; of Umm al Ba‘rur at 4,000, and of Ghammas at 1,000. Each is treated separately in the following report. The municipalities are possibly, from an administrative standpoint, the most interesting features of the Division. Their number is large and will become larger, the population is dense, and the difficulties to be overcome considerable. There is the additional attraction in that each is a unit which it is the object of the Administration to make both self-supporting and progresive. It is through an enlightened municipal policy that general advancement throughout the country is most rapidly secured, as the people themselves almost at once are able to see the benefits accruing from good management and their own efforts, since they are early called upon to take an interest in the management of town affairs. The municipalities are now more than self-supporting, with the exception of Najaf, where the works to be undertaken are of necessity so important and costly, especially in the matter of health improvement, that for a year or two it is probable a grant in aid will be needed. In Kufah and Umm al Ba‘rur great public spirit has been shown, the people undertaking considerable works of municipal improve ment at their own cost. The benefit to themselves from such action is not only theoretical, but, what they understand, practical: house property has gone up five times in value, there has been a large increase in trade, and there are many applications from outsiders to build. J Throughout the Division direct collection of municipal taxes has replaced the pernicious system of farms with very satisfactory results. In the case of ferries alone is the farm system continued, as, owing in many cases to their distance from the municipality concerned, direct control would not be advantageous. The house tax of 10 per cent, per annum on the rental value is being imposed from the beginning of the next financial year, and it is contemplated introducing the wharfaue tax of an anna per bale and a mooring tax of half an anna per ton per day also At Kufah, which is the great port, the collection of this will be largely facilitated and its imposition justified by the construction of the wharf wall. The future of Najaf undoubtedly lies in its being thoroughly opened no in a good water supply and in the improvement of its communications with the outer world; of Kufah, m careful town planning and the prevention of uncontrolled expansion, and of Umm al Ba‘rur, in the increase of permanent brick buildings and m the construction of a good river wall; of Ja‘arah, in the driving of a straight motor road between it and Abu Sukhair, and in the reconstruction of the bazaar Ghammas as it stands has no future; it should be destroyed and rebuilt on good ground some three miles upstream. ^ In addition to these, municipalities will certainly have to be formed at Muhannawiyah, Salachiyah and ‘Aqar. Turumah and Abu Shorah will follow!The former three places are tribal marts, consisting of bazaars of from 90-50 shops. From a Revenue standpoint, however, they are of great importance, as they are centres of barter and exchange for very large tribal areas. Situated as they are in North-East of the district, in the midst of a richly- cultivated area, but fairly distant from Government headquarters, they are at present somewhat uncontrolled. Small Shabanah posts have been appointed, but as soon as municipalities are formed they will have a powerful political effect. Abu Skorah is at present a very small place, with a new bazaar in course of construction. Its position, however, as the market of the Hor al Dukhn Bani Hasan, and as the river port on the direct road to Kufah, renders its development inevitable. Turumah is a large collection of mud huts, the centre of the Ghazalat tribe, and is situated on the southern extremity of the Mishkhab. It will eventually become a municipality, but its organisation will be of some difficulty, and is a matter for the more distant future. It will be seen that during the last three months of the year, when the municipalities may be said to have been fairly working, the administration of the municipalities, which comprise a population of over 60,000 persons, has entailed expenditure of over Rs. 12,000/- per mensem, which has been met from municipal taxation. For next year, conservative estimates are double this, and the municipal income of the Division should approximate to three lakhs of rupees. Najqf-Kufah Municipalities, 1918. General .—It may be of use to record a brief note on what appears to be the condition of Najaf at the close of the war, and to offer an opinion as to the problems which are likely to confront us in the near future. Now that a start has been made we have no choice but to push ahead, and the pitfalls of the road are as full of interest as the goal which we hope to attain. The reason why we cannot go back on our track is sufficiently obvious. To relax control of Najaf would be to loosen our hold over the whole of the Euphrates. To call a halt is impossible, as we cannot continue indefinitely to administer a town rotten with abuses, that loudly challenge our dignity and our courage. Najaf-Kufah is certain to become a very large and a very important city before many years have passed. Whether it is to become a glorious, monument to British administration in the eyes of every Shi‘ah Muhammadan, or a hotbed of anti-British intrigue, entirely depends on our early recognition of its influence and size. It must be remembered that the Turks did recognise this, but the diseased heart was unable to provide vigour and strength to the extremities of its circulatory system, which atrophied from malnutrition. The successful revolt of the town against the Turkish authority after the battle of Shffiaibah, and the degrading expulsion of their inadequate troops, was a blow of very considerable importance. Najaf has hitherto figured to us as a turbulent desert town, visited periodically by large numbers of pilgrims, which will inevitably be largely increased by the opening of the Euphrates to navigation and the advance of railways. It has not yet, however, made its debut in the role of an important market at the Junction of two trade routes, which will never be affected by the competition of railways. In addition to the magnet of ‘Ali’s tomb, this town is the possessor of a large dump, where the caravans from Central Arabia offload the raw materials of the desert, and return with rice and clothing, where Beduin middlemen exchange the silks and calicoes of Homs and Hama with grain, cattle and merchandise from Basrah and Bombay. The war has completely shut down this trade, but the large merchants are now ready to return to business after five years’ inactivity, and we may expect a surprise when the trade routes to Hail and Damascus are once more opened. Dwellers in Mesopotamia have not been slow to realise the advantages, temporal and eternal, which are likely to accrue to enterprising merchants, established in the neighbourhood of Mashhad ‘Ali, under a settled government. House property has already risen enormously and an immigration into Kufah has begun, even from towns on the Tigris.86 The completion of the pipe line from Kufah to Najaf is likely to be coincident with the linking of the two towns with a continuous line of houses. In Najaf itself many of the townspeople, including Saiyid Kadhim Yazdi, wish to build houses on the Kufah road, and the centre of gravity of ground/values has shifted from the centre to the outskirts of the town. Najaf to-day consists of a cramped town of narrow streets and indifferent houses, surrounding a magnificent mosque, approached by an excellent bazaar. Each house contains at least one tier of cellars, a well more than 100 feet deep, and very often one or two tombs. The roads and buildings all rise from the insecure foundations of crumbling and forgotten sardabs, into which percolate the overflow of countless cesspits and latrines. This great sponge, saturated with the slime of dormant sickness, is surrounded by a wall constructed about 120 years ago. That the town has not hitherto been visited by an annihilating disease is a matter for surprise, which has been explained by the assertion that immunity for about this period is frequently enjoyed by crowded and walled towns of this description. The bones of many such are to be seen round Delhi. The population of Najaf is about 45,000, and is largely dependent on charity, or on payment for professional religious services. Shi‘ah charities fall under three main heads :— (1) Distribution of water. (2) Lighting. (3) Alms for the poor. All of these are paid, either as yearly contributions from living Mahommedans, or are the income of Waqf property administered by agents on behalf of departed believers. The first and third have to be paid direct to Mujtabids or else little merit attaches to the pious provider. The greater the Mujtahid, the more acceptable the sacrifice. Money for lighting the shrine, and for the private sepulchres of Shi‘ah families, is usually entrusted to the Kiliddar for disbursement. About £10,000 is believed to be sent to Najaf annually for lighting the shrine alone. This allows a handsome margin. Kings, ministers, nobles, and merchants, all sleep in the Happy Valley between Amir al Muminin and Husain, and each resting place is provided with a qari‘, who reads over pages of the Quran and trims the lights, to make the Lover of Darkness keep his distance. A visit to the wadi on a Thursday evening will reveal over 2,000 readers engaged in earning their pious livelihood. These men are recruited from the students at Najaf, who get tired of attendance at lectures and who find the road to knowledge and the strict religious life less attractive than, this easy occupation. The emoluments are not high. One reader probably looks after three tombs for a fee of 5 rupees a month each. He is, however, enrolled in the list of the Holy Poor and gets his share of the general monthly distributions of alms entrusted to Saiyid Kadhim. The sums subscribed for the distribution of water to the poor amount to about £6,000 annually. This is a most important Shi‘ah charity, though not absolutely incumbent on all, and great sums of money have been spent in all ages in unsuccessful attempts to bring water to Najaf. The reason for this, is the remembrance of the sufferings from thirst of the Imam Husain during the days preceeding his murder. The third charity is incumbent on all true Shi‘ahs, and may be subdivided into the following :— (1) The Khums, or fifth part of the income. This is the perquisite of Saiyids. (2) The Zalcat is a tithe, paid to all the poor. (3) Radd ilfuza/m.--Government salaries as contributed from taxes enforced by law are, to a strict Shi‘ah, haram. It is however possible to enjoy the fruits of labour without transgression by the purchase of a special forgiveness from a Mujtahid. In addition to the above are miscellaneous sums of a more or less voluntarv nature which are handed over to the great alims: J (a) Saum wa Salat, or fees paid in return for an order that prayers and fastings on behalf of a certain person are to be observed for periods that vary according to the amount paid.(b) Money vowed to big ‘Ulama in return for recovery from sickness or extrication from danger. (c) Hissat Imam or money handed over to make provision for the promised Mahdi. The amount of money received by Saiyid Kadhim alone is said to be as much as Rs. 1,20,000 a year. This sum only represents a fraction of what is really intended for the town. A proper organisation of Shi‘ah waqfs in Persia, and an administration of receipts in Najaf would possibly produce a yearly income of little short of a million sterling. The spread of education in Persia and ‘Iraq may, in years to come, induce the charitable to take an interest in the destination of their alms, and incline them to the opinion that the endowment of colleges and hospitals is more meritorious than the indiscriminate encouragement of mendicants and quacks. This digression on charities would seem out of place in a municipal note, but a clear knowledge of the prejudices and superstitions of the people is absolutely necessary to ensure smooth running and successful taxation, and is of use in almost every problem that crops up in Najaf. There are at present no “ leading ” men in Najaf, and the actions of the better- known citizens and ‘Ulama are dictated by their love of money, always over shadowed by their intense fear of unpopularity. There is no fanaticism in Najaf, except, perhaps for a few hours during the excitement of the big anniversaries, but an appearance of strict attendance to religious observances is observed to maintain the lucrative reputation of sanctity of the city and its inhabitants, on which the livelihood of so many depends. The Devil, usually in the form of a greedy merchant, has been known to misquote the provisions of the Radd Mazalim (page 98), in informing his more superstitious customers that the purchase of food at Government controlled prices is haram. It is, perhaps, open to question whether it is not the purchaser’s social rather than religious aspirations which induce him to part with the extra halfpence. Owing to the fact that Shi‘ah Mujtahids, unlike Sunnis, are allowed to place their own interpretations on the words of the Quran and the traditional sayings of the Prophet and the Imams, the study of Shi‘ah religious law has no limit. For tliis reason students study for very many years. There are at Najaf about 20 colleges, all residential, the largest having accom modation for 500 students. There are at present about 6,000 students of religious law in Najaf, about one-third of whom are Persians. Their ages range from 20 to 60. The advantages of graduating at Najaf are considerable. Firstly, not only are no fees required, but sufficient money is given to students from charities to maintain themselves and their families. These allowances are not conditional on continuous application to study. Many of the students have enjoyed a comfortable income and free quarters for 30 or 40 years without having mastered the art of reading and writing. Secondly, the candidate has the hope that he may be given his certificate by one of the Mujtahids to the effect that he has reached the state of Ijtihad, which allows him to interpret religious law. This ensures him success through life. Should he fail to secure this, which is by no means easy, he has every chance of other rewards for his labours in the shape of letters recommending him as a suitable person to handle or receive charities, or give decisions on minor religious cases. Shi‘ah religious law is a very comprehensive and complicated study, which ranges from the law of divorce and inheritance and fevitical laws of ‘ayun bil ‘ayun and sin bil sin—an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth—about each of which hundreds of books have been written, all of which must be mastered by Mujtahids. The Quran ordains that the hands of robbers are to be cut off. Whether the incision should be made in the knuckles or the shoulder is left to the Mujtahid to decide. This is a point of considerable controversy, and has provided material for many books. In the eyes of a strict Shi‘ah any Government are usurpers, as they are not qualified to interpret and put into execution the laws of God and His Prophet. As the Najafis are capable of quoting the Scriptures for their own purpose, it is as well never to forget this tenet of theirs.88 The trade of Najaf before the war was in the hands of capable Persian merchants. These, however, took fright when war broke out, and their place has been taken by petty Arab traders, whose dishonesty and greed is only exceeded by their folly. They are only a nuisance in so far that they exercise considerable ingenuity in their efforts at raising the price of food and necessaries. Normal conditions will ensure their elimination. Kufah is at present a suburb of Najaf, and is almost entirely owned by the rich inhabitants of that town. Originally the advanced base of the victorious armies of the Faithful, it became the capital of ‘Iraq and a famous university. As Kufah absorbed Hirah (Ja‘arah), the Persian capital of Chaldaea, so Najaf has overshadowed the great and famous city of ‘Ali. Whether a new and healthy modern town is likely to rise on the banks of the Euphrates and revive the glory and prosperity of the first great Arab city is a matter which the future will decide. The existence of such a town, not secluded from the beaten track and within 6 miles of Najaf, would be the solution of many problems. Taxation : General .—The taxation of Najaf, like many other innovations, is not an easy problem, and is only now beginning to show signs of solution. The inhabitants of Najaf have for many years looked upon themselves as privileged, and are prone to assume the garb of very strict Shkahism when convenient to themselves. Any form of taxation, except levies taken from those who come to the city, living or dead, is, according to religious law, haram. This fact is ceaselessly impressed by their victims on those appointed to collect and to supervise the collection of taxes in the town. These officials have not always shown an entire lack of sympathy with those putting forward this contention, and it is only by the production of the most accurate checking mechanism that it is at all possible to secure any reasonable results. Owing to disturbances and shortage of staff, it has hitherto been difficult to arrange improvements at a period when overtime work was necessary to keep the wheels turning at all. It must be acknowledged that the people of Najaf have not received much encouragement by a glimpse of a quid for their reluctant quo, and they are convinced that money extorted from them is a “ Droit de Seigneur ” insisted upon by a powerful, if sacrilegious Government. They do not connect security of goods, and comparative immunity of person from disease, with any outlay they may have been called upon to part with. Very little light comes from the 'Ulama, whose livelihood and prospects are entirely dependent on their popularity, which they seek to enhance by the frequent despatch of letters requesting wholly unjustifiable remissions of taxation on behalf of their numerous clients. It is proposed to put taxation on a far more reasonable basis from the beginning of the financial year, and largely increased receipts are confidently anticipated. It has been decided to hold a weekly majlis of representatives who have been already elected from each of the four quarters of Najaf and from Kufah. No assistance can be expected from such a council beyond the fact that they will be useful in explaining certain elementary facts about the necessity of municipal taxation, and the uses to which it is put. Their activity in making out a case for increased and regular taxation will be stimulated by the fact that they themselves in their capacity as advisers will share any odium occasioned by the new reforms. An attitude of unswerving firmness is required from the officer controlling the internal destinies of Najaf. As long as this is preserved order and contentment will prevail. Any relaxation in the nature of compromise or remission will inevitably be followed by an alarming puff of smoke. It must never for one moment be forgotten that the people of Najaf are living in the year of moral development e.c. 1919- -forgiveness is a hopeless anachronism. Punishment must follow crime and disobedience as surely as night follows day. It is not, however, suggested that a Prussian regime is called for or that punishments should be unnecessarily severe. It is strongly advocated that a visible return should be given to the people for their money as soon as possible. For this reason it has been proposed in the budget that incandescent lighting should be introduced in the bazaars and main89 streets of Najaf and Kufah without delay, and provision has been made for the levelling and paving of the main bazaar, coupled with the demolition of its very unsatisfactory approach. An excellent form of taxation for Najaf would be provided by the acquisition by the Municipality of the tramway to Kufah, and the institution of a service of motor or electric trams. Under the present agreement the tramway becomes the property of Government at the end of 30 years. The price of the rails should not be prohibitive if this is taken into account, and the profits would be a source of considerable income to the town and of considerable saving to the travelling public. The accompanying graphs will show the comparative success in the taxation of Najaf and Kufah in 1918. In the past year considerable advance has been made in the collection of taxes in both towns. In the former the receipts of the quarter ending December 1918 are 25 per cent, more than those of the preceding quarter, while at Kufah the receipts have been more than tripled since the beginning of the year. Unfortunately, figures for Najaf previous to June 1918 are not available, as they were lost during the disturbances. The increased receipts are due to improved training of the staff, and to the fact that direct collection has entirely superseded the system of farms, which had to be adopted at the beginning of the year owing to lack of personne]. House Tax .—Receipts from this tax under its various pseudonyms at Najaf have hitherto been the reverse of satisfactory. This should be the easiest of all taxes to administer, and is a particularly equitable form of taxation. Unfortunately the citizens of Najaf have no idea of any responsibility towards their town, and at present nearly half of the populace is excused or manages to evade payment of this tax. A census and detailed list of the houses in Najaf is being prepared, and will shortly be finished. It is intended to collect 10 per cent, on the rental of each house from the 1st of April, instead of the nominal amounts collected at present. This will cause great opposition, and a few lessons will have to be made to enforce obedience. Najaf cannot continue to behave like a spoilt and ignorant child, and considerable firmness is necessary at the present time, and will be in the future, to deal successfully with its whims and fancies. This list is being prepared in such a way that evasion on the part of the tax collectors will be traceable at once. Every kind of influence will be brought to bear to oppose the enforcement of this tax, which will produce scores of letters from the ‘Ulama calling attention to the extreme poverty of their clients, and the fact that many houses should be excused as they contain “ hujrahs,” in which rest the holy dead. If the requests of the ‘Ulama are regretfully declined, and no exceptions are made to this just taxation, opposition will dwindle and disappear at the end of two or three months. No difficulties are anticipated in the collection of the revised house tax from Kufah. Water Tax .—Water for Najaf is at present brought by a small canal from Abu Sukhair, and thence in mussacks on donkeys up the hill into the town for distribution. Two pumps have to work almost continuously throughout the year to fill this, and the expenses incurred by the working of the pumps and the clearing of the canal have been paid from general revenues at an average cost of about Rs. 1,500/— per month. It is proposed that the . town shall make itself responsible for this expenditure in the ensuing 3 ^ear, and to find the necessary money it will be necessary to increase the cost of each skin of water by half an anna. The payment of this small amount will not bear heavily on any of the people, who are protected by municipal regulation of the charges of saqks, whom indispensability had previously rendered tyrannical. At Kufah the necessity for no such tax arises, but a provision of a filtered drinking water supply will be of great benefit. Building Tax .—This has not been hitherto a great source of income to either municipality, chiefly owing to unrest and uncertainty. It is known that many desire to build at Kufah and at Najaf, but this is not to be encouraged until a town planner is able to visit the district and give advice on the nature and sites of new buildings at Najaf and Kufah. * 10 1162—1 d 390 The shortage of wood for building and its prohibitive price has also restricted activity in this direction. As is pointed out elsewhere, it is hoped that a supply of ferro-concrete beams may be soon available for house construction and repairs. Slaughter-house Tax. —The receipts from this tax have been low in both towns. This is partly due to difficulties of collection, and also to the fact that there has been a shortage of sheep owing to large purchases for the Army, and latterly for Mosul. The supply of sheep is likely to improve next year owing to the reduction of the military garrison, and the probable import of quantities from Central Arabia. A slaughter-house is under construction at Najaf, and one will shortly be built at Kufah. The fact that all animals will be slaughtered in these places will make the collection of the tax far easier to control. Hitherto half of this tax has been credited to General Revenues; it is earnestly hoped that its proceeds will, in future, be entirely devoted to municipahties. Oil. —The collection of licences on oil affords no difficulties. The comparative insignificance of recipts in the past year is due to the irregularity and inadequacy of supplies. It is hoped that this will shortly be remedied and an income of about Rs. 12,000/- may be expected from the two towns in the coming year. Wardiyah Tax. —This tax is collected once a month on all draft and pack animals that ply for hire. It has been productive of a considerable income, averaging in the last quarter Rs. 520/- p. m. at Kufah, and no less than Rs. 1,500/- p. m. at Najaf. This is largely provided by the pilgrim traffic, and the honest enthusiasm of the collectors for the unrelenting taxation of the stranger at the gates has helped to swell the receipts. Maidaniyah Tax —Is a tax of 2J per cent, levied on the sale proceeds of all animals other than sheep sold in open market, and produces an average income of Rs. 1,000/- p. m. at Najaf, and Rs. 300/- p. m. at Kufah. Najaf is the place of sale for large numbers of animals brought in from outside. The following are the approximate numbers and prices of animals sold each month at present:— Animals, Number. Price—Rs. Donkeys Horses Mules Oxen* Camels* Buffaloes 200 30-50 80-100 20-30 20-25 20-30 40/- to 100/- 100/- „ 300/- 150/- „ 700/- 75/- „ 100/- 100 /- „ 120 /- 1S0/- „ 200/- Dallaliyah Is a similar tax to Maidaniyah, levied on all articles sold by auction. It is not particularly satisfactory, as being difficult to control and easy to evade. It has only been started one month in the two municipalities, and has produced an income of Rs. 520/- at Najaf and Rs. 180/- at Kufah. The principal goods auctioned are vegetables, carpets, old clothes and house hold utensils, about one-half of the income being produced by the first of these This augurs well for receipts in the vegetable season next year. Watch and Ward. During the past year an assessment was made of all houses and shops in Kufah and Najaf for the payment of this tax. At Najaf the receipts from shops went by the name of Paswaniyah, and the money from private houses was known as Kanasiyah and Baitiyah. At Kufah no distinction was made and the tax was taken from houses and shops alike as Paswanivah. Receipts from the shop tax are now collected as Paswaniyah in both towns and the proceeds are set aside for the payment of Paswans, or as contributions to police, when and if they replace them. It is expected that the receipts next year t? 11 f 0 ^ 1 ? u Gr C i? nt ’ ° f f nts - Wl11 amount to 10,000 at Najaf and R®’ 7&gt;j&gt; 00 /- at Kufah, where a charge is also levied on loaded bellams for much needed protection.

Tn past years the receipts from the Turkish bridge tax at Kufah was shared by both municipalities. The bridge was destroyed by floods and neglect in December, 1916, and ferry boats were the only means of transit. The right to collect ferry dues was farmed for Rs. 4,475/- a quarter. A new bridge was constructed by the military authorities and opened to the public on the 1st September. The bridge tolls were handed over to the military for upkeep of the bridge. As this amount represented nearly half the then income of the Kufah municipality, a grant in aid of Rs. 15,000/— was sanctioned. The early acquisition of the bridge by the Civil Department is most desirable, when it will presumably be restored to the municipality by purchase spread over a reasonable period. Four small ferries in the municipal area are still in use and have been farmed on a yearly lease of Rs. 3,000/-. Town Improvements .—Very little was done last year towards the improvements of Najaf, chiefly owing to lack of money and material. . The demolition of houses all round the town to make a road inside the walls for armoured cars has given Najaf some much needed ventilation. All Government buildings were destroyed in the riots of 1915 and 1918, and a great number of private houses have suffered as well. The old Government Sarai has been recently put into thorough repair, and made into an excellent dispensary. The inhabitants have subscribed a sum of Rs. 4,000/- for further additions. A large pilgrim khan just inside the Kufah gate, belonging to the Bohra community, has also been put into partial repair as a police barracks. It is hoped that this building will be completed next year. In addition to the ruined Government property referred to above, there are a large number of houses confiscated from proscribed persons implicated in the 1918 disturbances. These are in varying stages of decay. Provision has been made in the 1919-1920 budget for a Municipal Engineers’ establishment for Najaf and Kufah at a cost of nearly Rs. 18,000/-. Until a Civil Engineer can give these towns the benefit of his advice and undivided attention, it is quite impossible to start the general work of reconstruction. This will include the training of local craftsmen in improved brick construction, with oil fuel, the use of ferro concrete in the place of unobtainable timber, and European methods of accurate workmanship. In addition to the planning of new buildings and repairs to old, a complete draininge scheme must soon be considered, and wide streets must be constructed in the place of the present consumptive alleys. Complete plans for a water supply by pipe line from Kufah have been made by Lieut. Morris of the E. and M. Section R.E. About 2,500 pipes, 14-in., had been purchased for this purpose by a company formed before the war, in which Najaf Municipality holds a third share. Twelve hundred of these were at ‘Ashar at the outbreak of war, waiting transhipment to Kufah. These were commandeered by the Military authorities when we occupied Basrah. The remainder are in situ along the proposed line. Five hundred of these have been requisitioned for railway embankments on the Diyalah line. In view of the fact that their value at Najaf at present freight rates is nearly £10/- a pipe, and of the extraordinary difficulties of transport, the necessity for their removal is most regrettable. A guarantee, however, has been given that these will be replaced after the war, and it is to be hoped that it will be possible to give early attention to the fulfilment of this promise. It has been suggested that the water-pumping plant at Kufah might be combined with an electric power station to light both towns and provide power for numerous pumps and mills and the tramway to Najaf. The latter is the only means of communication with the river and the outer world, as lack of water and deep sand make other forms of wheel traffic impracticable. The present tramway is excellently laid and of the best material. The rolling stock, however, is deplorable, chiefly owing to difficulties of replacement during the war. The traditional love of the Arab for his horse is a far more inspiring theme than his affection for hard cash, but the life-story of any of the eighty horses belonging to the tramway company would go a long way towards shattering an ideal. Thirty-five of these horses are at present beyond work.92 * It has already been suggested above that a service of motor or electric trams owned by Municipality would bring a large income to the two towns. The fact that the takings on a single day have amounted to over Rs. 1,000/— during a pilgrimage would provide a further argument in favour of such an undertaking. At Kufah a good deal has been done. A river wall is being built by the owners of houses on the bank at a cost of about Rs.. 2 lacs and at present half the length is completed. The Municipality is assisting with a sum of Rs.44,000/-, which has been advanced as a loan from General Revenues. The bazaars have been drained and levelled and brick pavements constructed on either side of the roads. The properties of paint as a preservative of woodwork and as an embellishment to shops and houses have been brought to the notice of house-owners. It is not proposed to do much at Kufah in the coming year, as the completion of the wharf wall will absorb most of the funds and energy of this municipality. A certain amount of drainage and road improvement will be considered. Health and Sanitation .—Of even more importance than the improvement of streets and buildings is the urgent necessity that expert sanitary attention should be turned to Najaf without delay. As has been pointed out above, the conditions in favour of the successful incubation and distribution of a pandemic are almost ideal. The infant mortality is known to be prodigious—syphilis almost universal. Very few inhabitants who have passed middle age are free from consumption. The supply of drinking water is inadequate and liable to contamination. The water from wells is impregnated with salt and fouled with sewage. Only very temporary and superficial measures were undertaken in the past year owing to lack of personnel and material. Small pox and cholera broke out in Kufah and Abu Sukhair in September. The reason that these did not spread to any great extent was owing to the measures taken by S.A.S. ‘Abdul Latif, who worked very hard in the segregation of small pox cases—a most unpopular precaution. About 100 cases of small pox occurred in Najaf, with 32 deaths. Many children were also blinded by this disease. ‘Abdul Latif vaccinated over 300 children within a few days in the streets. Jarrahas were seen inoculating children with the dried pus of small pox pustules, which is obtainable from Jews at Hillah, who are understood to keep this commodity in stock. Subject to correction by a medical expert, this practice must be highly dangerous. The influenza epidemic did not fail to give Najaf a visit, but, fortunately, in a very mild form and only a few deaths occurred. It is expected that over a million pilgrims will visit Najaf next year. It is inevitable that the town will become a Disease Exchange of considerable importance, and the provision of a Health Staff on a scale capable of copin 0- with this influx is quite beyond the sphere of the Municipality. Similarly adequate conservancy arrangements cannot be met by Municipal Funds. This was recognised by the late Government, and a Quarantine tax of Rs. 4/- was levied on each corpse brought into the town. The money from this fund was theoretically devoted to a health staff, who controlled the influx of pilgrims and corpses and made arrangements for the protection of the water supplv and the segregation of disease. This tax has produced an income of Rs 52 000/- since June and is credited to General Revenues. It is expected that it will amount to Rs. 1,20,000/ next year. It is hoped that the whole of this amount will be devoted to the creation of a Health Office at Najaf, under a British officer with trained subordinates, which will be as beneficial to other towns as to Najaf and U a l / ?m? OSa iaS ? een in the Budget and an extract of the suggested Establishment and Expenditure is added to this note. Temporary latrines have been built in both towns, but are quite inadequate. devised^' 11111611 * Stl ' UCtUreS mUSt wait until some kind of drainage scheme is w T T e TT C .f anl T mess of tlie streets has been due to the excellent work of Ewaz 4lb the Sanitary Inspector, who has made his subordinates work satisfactorily.Proposed Establishment and Expenditure of Health Office at Najaf and Kufah.

Medical. —A dispensary was opened at Kufah in February 1918, under the charge of S.A.S. ‘Abdul Latif. Attendance at first was very low, and almost confined to eye cases, which are extraordinarily prevalent. After about a couple of months confidence was established, and the attendance got so large that permission was obtained for the extension of the dispensary and the provision of six beds. Very kind assistance in equipping the new wards was given by the British Red Cross. More than 200 patients attended daily, and it became necessary to open an additional dispensary at Najaf to relieve congestion. This was done at the end of October, and the old Government Sarai was rebuilt in the form of a small hospital. The average attendance was about 130. From the beginning of 1919 a charge of four annas for first, and two annas for subsequent visits has been taken, except from those excused payment on account of poverty. This has caused a considerable decrease in attendance, but it is hoped that this will not last long. The following diseases are most common in the two towns:— Eye troubles; syphilis; malaria; phthisis; stone in bladder; condy loma ; and gonorrhoea. Syphilis is most common and is spread more in the form of syphilitic * stomatitis, from the sharing of cigarette-holders, than from prostitution, which is unknown. Prevalence of condylomata amongst children is most distressing. Tuber culosis is also almost universal among the elder inhabitants. A sum of Rs. 10,000/- has been provided in the Budget for compensation for the demolishing of crowded quarters. This may help to beat down this scourge. A hospital for infectious diseases is very badly needed, and it is hoped that the Quarantine Fund will be able to provide a building suitable for the infectious cases of both towns. . r ~04 Food Supply and Prices ,—The supplies of food and oil to Najaf in the past half year have given considerable trouble. The town was rationed on barley at lbs. per head per diem. Government barley was sold at 10 annas a huqqah, the market supply of such private supplies as reached the town being four annas higher. Sales were restricted to about 8 tons daily and were very carefully controlled. Almost coincident with the declaration of the Armistice the price of private barley dropped to eight annas. Government barley was also reduced to eight annas, which induced a further fall of an anna in the price of private grain, at which rate it is now being sold, of excellent quality and unlimited quantity. This goes to show that large quantities of grain were hidden in sardabs, and not used until the feeling of insecurity disappeared. The price of meat has been very difficult to control. Careful inquiries were made and orders were issued fixing the maximum price of mutton at 8 annas a lb. The butchers were determined to get more for their pound of flesh. The method of evasion they adopted was to inform their customers that Government had forced them to sell at a loss, and that a purely optional expenditure of an extra kaan would save them from the sin of buying what amounted to confiscated property, and was therefore haram. As this practice was universal it was necessary to imprison all the butchers, about 40 in number. The price has since been raised 2 annas a lb., as sheep are very scarce. It is realised that competition is the best regulator of market prices, but when that element is lacking, owing to supernormal conditions, maximum prices have to be fixed to prevent robbery by the confederated purveyors. Should the necessity for the control of the prices of foodstuffs rise next year, it is hoped that some universal system of fixing prices may be adopted. See Diagram. Jaarah and Abu Sukhair .—These two are included as one municipality The tormer is a large town containing about 6,000 inhabitants, though from a municipal s andpomt the population of the date gardens which surround it must be included which brings up the total to about 10,000. Abu Sukhair holds, approximately,’ 600 people The position of Ja‘arah renders municipal improvement exceedingly ddhcult. !t is completely shut in on all sides by date gardens, and therefore cut on from the world. Its connection with Abu Sukhair is a bad narrow winding road o owing a canal, about one mile long. In former times, owing to its isolation, it was untouched by any Government, and the consequence has been that the people have developed the undisciplined habits of the town dwelling Arab to a degree that was qui e exceptional. The town was externally filthy. Defecation in the public horoughfare was the rule, the precincts of the mosque even were not made an exception The town affairs were run by the Zuwain family, who were feared by the people, and the mam body of opinion was directed by a ring of about 25 merchants, wno oppressed and robbed the people and indulged in intrigue.

All important tribal Shaikhs have their private houses here and the Government buildings are of a nature to impress the people. These consist of three large khans, well repaired and clean. The Irrigation Department occupy one of these khans. The other two are taken by the Political Department, holding all the offices necessary for administration, a properly organised prison and Shabanah barracks. It is unfortunate that the Najaf water supply run through this place and, therefore, the water is contaminated; but this is unavoidable. At present Irrigation, Local Resources, and the I.W.T. all have their offices here. The estimated monthly revenue and expenditure last year was about Rs. 1,500/-. The receipts, however, have exceeded this. The imposition of the house and wharfage tax and close control will, however, swell receipts and next year over Rs. 30,000/- is expected, or an increase of over Rs. 1,000/- per mensem on last year’s average. The first step towards improvement which the municipality can now afford will be the acquisition of a paid Rais Baladiyah, if possible a Kurd. The Zuwaini influence is pernicious to a degree. Some of the surplus income will go as a contribution towards the new road, which will benefit others besides the inhabitants of Ja‘arah. The remainder will be fully taken up in necessary sanitary works. Umm al Ba‘rur .—Umm al BaTur lies on the left bank of the Shamiyah Channel, almost due west of Diwaniyah, to which a main road is in course of construction, and east of Abu Sukhair on the Kufah Channel. Its original site was a mile or so upstream and slightly inland. From this spot the town was moved by order of Sultan Abdul Hamid owing to the unhealthiness of the site, rebuilt on the present site and given the name of Hamidiyah. It was well planned, on the same model, so it is said, as Kut. A municipality of a type existed here till the beginning of August 1918, but supervision was almost impossible owing to the lack of staff and urgency of more important work. From August 1st this town, which has some 5,000 inhabitants exclusive of the garden population surrounding it, was made the headquarters of the Deputy Assistant Political Officer, Eastern Shamiyah Subdivision. The municipality was reorganised and improvements put in hand at once. In July 1918 its condition was almost as bad as it would be possible to imagine. There was a fine bazaar, but it was filthy. All the roads, except one, consisted of ditches or canals filled with stagnant water, there were a large number of depressions filled with water, and the river was eating away the river front with appalling rapidity and threatening to destroy every house on it at the next flood. To-day the town is entirely unrecognisable. New roads have been opened, all ditches and depressions filled up, the river bank repaired, the markets organised, a full municipal staff engaged, and the whole show get running as a self-contained, self-supporting and successful enterprise. The credit of this is due to the energy of the D.A.P.O. Jad Ghawi Effendi, of the Honorary Rais Baladiyah Hasan Effendi, and, above all, to the whole-hearted cooperation and energy of the people OXYl S ol V O S As regards practical and non- spectacular results, the markets are crowded, the price of the foodstuffs low, trade booming, building going on (there will be a tremendous impetus to this after the winter, when brick contractois will establish kilns) and the price of house property is now actually five times what it was in July, and at that owners are refusing to sell. Roads. No less than nine new roads have been opened and the ditches filled in. None are less than 20 feet wide, straight, and passable for motors. Arrangements are being made to plant avenues of willows in necessary places. This woik v as done almost entirely by the people themselves. River Front. This has been and is being repaired with stakes, berdi and earth. In a few days time it will be passable for a motor from end to end. There is no doubt that directly brick contractors come down the people will ask to build a brick wall as in Kufah. Steps and landing stages are being built at the entrance of every street. Bazaars and Markets .—These are broad, well laid out and zinc-roofed. To the east, where the new road has been opened out, they aie already extending. The greatest order and cleanliness prevails. The butchers, vegetable sellers, &amp;c., are all grouped into special quarters. There is also a special khan (marked with an X) in which the country people bring milk and buttei for sale evei \96 day. This is scrupulously clean and is inspected, as is every other shop, daily. The coffee-shops are graded into four classes, are very clean and bear special signs and decorations. They do a roaring trade. There is also a hotel providing Arab food of excellent quality at a fixed rate. This is invariably full of shaikhs, merchants, &amp;c. The bazaars are drained in the usual cesspit system. This has been carefully repaired. Mosques. —There are two, a Sunni and a Shi‘ah. Both were in urgent need of repair, and on the Td al Adha the people subscribed over Rs. 4,000/- for this purpose. The money has been placed in the hands of a committee, one of whom is the Wakil of Saiyid Kadhim Yazdi, and the repairs are now going on and will shortly be completed. They include a house of the Katib of the Sunni Mosque (his salary is paid by Government). Saiyid Kadhim Yazdi has expressed the greatest appreciation of what has been done. Government Buildings. —There are only two : the ‘Ambar, built by Irrigation, and the Shabanah Barracks. Both are sun-dried bricks, and the latter especially is an excellent piece of work. The wood brought in by the Shaikhs after they had voluntarily destroyed their Maftuls has proved extraordinarily useful for the roof. The building is capable of accommodating 80 Shabanah and 30 horses. The town is fortunate in possessing an energetic and wealthy honorary Rais Baladiyah. The work of the whole staff has been creditable to a degree. Last year s budget, as in Ja‘arah, showed receipts and expenditure of Rs. 1,500/— per mensem. Receipts here have again gone up and the balance at the end of the year is over Rs. 4,000/-. Next year’s income is estimated at Rs. 30,000/-. The construction of a wire-ferry is urgently needed and sanction was obtained for a loan of Rs. 4,000/- from General Revenues for this purpose. The ferry is now in course of construction, and the satisfactory state of the finances permit of the repayment of the loan at once. The town is an ideal one for the headquarters of a district, for trade and for expan- sion. It is well laid out and not crowded. It will have a main road running direct to Diwaniyah, and will almost certainly in the future have a branch line to Diwaniyah. a^i/ S ce fd ie an incredibly rich district, with another road running direct to Abu Sukhair and so to Najaf. The people are thoroughly go-ahead. The present urgent needs are a dispensary, a school and a good Government building. There is plenty of land and plenty of good sites. Next year should see the establishment of ail of these. Ghammas.—A small town on the left bank' of the Shamiyah Channel. It is built on a foundation of reeds and probably it would be difficult to find a more unhealthy site. Owing to the high level of the water-table, seepage is everywhere evident, large pools of stagnant wuter of every conceivable colour are the rule. Many houses are islands, surrounded by this foul liquid. It is therefore inevitable that disease should be prevalent, and every year there is a fair mortality from small-pox and fever. T M , ala ;: i /i 1 ??i eens were f ° und in 18 c hildren out of 20 examined, or 90 per cent, lam doubtful if any remedy, short of the town’s removal to another spot, will be by The Abu TabTht^y * ^ Pe ° Ple ’ ^ ^ is ° Wned almost entirel y It is not to be expected that much improvement can be accomplished in such a place.

Both Umm al Bahur and Ghammas have a fruitful source of revenue in their ferries.

(1) Criminal Cases .—In such the Political Officer is sitting as a magistrate. Serious crime has been remarkably little and tribal murders nil, or rather none haw come to light. The tendency undoubtedly will be in the future for the tribes concerned to wish to have the case tried by the magistrate, instead of appealing to the tribal majlis for a fasl. There has been a certain amount of petty criminal cases, which have been tried summarily. (2) Land Cases .—The policy in these cases, a policy dictated by the pressure and urgency of other more important work, has only been to hear such as would, if left unsettled by executive and temporary order, cause political trouble, loss to revenue, or serious inconvenience and danger to the parties concerned. The parties are always first asked, in the cases of possession which the shaPah can hear, if they wish to go before the shar‘ah in Najaf. If willing and the shaPah are willing to hear and decide the case the matter is ended. Frequently, however, the parties will not go before the shaPah, or the shaPah will not hear the case. If the shaPah decides the case the decision is brought before the Political Officer, who confirms that the case is settled. In cases which are not brought before the shaPah the Political Officer passes an order on the case which is binding until the opening of a properly constituted court, when the parties are at liberty to reopen the case if they wish. A considerable number of disputes have been settled in this way, either temporarily or permanently, in the case of shaPah decision. The most important of these was undoubtedly the Zuwaini family land dispute, which has been famous for 40 years and involved immense interests. The right of appeal from the decision of an A.P.O. to the Political Officer is occasionally exercised, and very seldom the right of further appeal to Baghdad. (3) Civil Suits .—For possession of house property, arrears of rent, debt., &amp;c. The shaPah has again been employed where the parties are willing, and a few cases of the first type, where urgent action was necessary, have been decided by the Political Officer exercising his powers as a judge of the peace. Cases for arrears of rent, debt, and so on, it has however been impossible to touch. The entertainment of one such plea would have resulted in a flood of petitions which perforce must have been heard and which would have held up the whole work of the Division for six months. (4) ShaCah Cases .—The question of the scope and recognition of the decisions of the Mujtahids of Najaf requires very careful consideration, both from the point of possible confusion in the event of the establishment of properly constituted courts in Najaf, and also in view of the great Mujtahid’s position in the Shi‘ah world. This latter needs brief explanation. The great Shkah Mujtahid—there are only some four and only two of these are of supreme importance—are those who have the power of giving the Fatwah, which is irrevocable and final. They can and do, and will cancel the decision of any Shkah shaPah throughout the world if the matter is brought before them and they see reason for alteration. Every Shkah has the right to go to them, and the large shaPah cases of Persia and ‘Iraq are always decided at &amp; Najaf. It would be impossible to interfere with this power, which is ,a right. In the case of the constitution of a Shkah shaPah at Baghdad or elsewhere it will be necessary to remember this. As regards the first point, the possibility of confusion, this is not great or serious. There are certain cases which are definitely shaPah and which the people themselves will not think of taking to a civil court. There are others which could be heard by shaPah or civil. In such cases it would be politic to preserve the present attitude, to give the parties the right of taking the case before the shaPah should they so wish. The careful preservation of the policy of non-interference by the civil courts in any matter which has been decided by the shar ah, and reciprocal non-interference on the part of the shaPah which, the' writer here can speak with some experience, is recognised readily, will make the constitution of a civil court in Najaf a matter of no difficulty and sound policy. It is hoped shortly to appoint a Mujtahid as Hakim al ShaPah in Najaf, who will be responsible for the hearing of all cases sent in by the Political Officer. This will greatly expedite work and justice.98 The creation oi a civil court at Najaf has been promised. It will undoubtedly have very heavy work, not only from Najaf but from the whole Division. 7. Education. —Owing to political troubles, the complexity of the area, and the lack of staff it has been impossible to devote any time to this important branch of administration. It is, however, hoped that the next financial year will see the establishment of schools at Najaf, Kufah, Abu Sukhair and Umm al Ba‘rur. A very large initial expenditure will be necessary and it is almost superfluous to point out that the employment of any Muslim teachers other than Shi‘ah would be disastrous to a degree. 8. Medical and Sanitary.— The Medical Establishment that has been asked for in the district is as below:— S.A.S. - - - 2 Sweepers - - - 2 Compounders - - 4 Ward-boys - - - 2 Bisthy - - - 2 The organisation would be as follows : each S.A.S. will have his headquarters at Ja‘arah and Umm al Ba‘rur respectively, being responsible for the population down one branch of the river in general, and for the municipalities in particular. Eventually, at each headquarters will be a hospital; but at present a dispensary, with accommodation for few patients, and a small operating room, is all that can be managed. That of Ja‘arah, as it stands at present—and which is typical—contains dispensary, office, one male ward (three beds), one female ward (three beds), surgical dressing room, operating theatre, kitchen, and S.A.S. quarters. When a proper hospital is built, this will then become the official district dispensary, but until that time it serves as hospital. In Western Shamiyah the S.A.S. would spend four days at headquarters and three days touring, leaving a compounder in charge. In Eastern Shamiyah he would be on tour four days and remain three at the base. The different arrangement is necessitated by the amount of small municipalities in Eastern Shamiyah. The municipal population on each river is approximately the same; but in the one case it is concentrated in Ja‘arah and Abu Sukhair, while in the other it is spread over Umm al Ba‘rur, Ghammas, Abu Shorah, Muhannawiyah, Salachiyah, and ‘Aqar. It is quite impossible at present to give any accurate information as to the health of the district. It is probable that an organised medical establishment will bring to light a state of affairs the reverse of reassuring. This should not cause surprise, for the condition of the district and the occupations of a large proportion of the people lend themselves to the free propagation of microbes. This will be the better understood if we consider the state of affairs before the organisation of Government. Each municipality ran its sanitary (?) arrangements on the same lines, though some were rather more markedly offensive than others. Those householders who owned cesspits—the majority had none—never had them cleaned. The public road and the public latrines were synonymous terms—even the precincts of the mosque were not omitted. The streets in the towns were simply trenches, convenient receptacles for any kind of rubbish. Pools of stagnant water abounded, and flies and mosquitoes were as ubiquitous as the foul odours which were characteristic of any municipal centre. A further source of disease was the contamination of the water. The land in Shamiyah is very largely waterlogged, with the result that the level of the water- table is in some places only 6 in. below the surface. Hence there is constant contamination of the water-supply from the cesspits Dead bodies, victims of cholera and small-pox or any other disease, are always washed in the canals from which all draw their drinking water. ' It is not surprising, therefore, to find that cholera and small-pox are yearly occurrences, and that malarial spleens are the rule rather than the exception. ” As to the death rate, figures are unobtainable; but it would be a remarkable occurrence to travel between Najaf and Abu Sukhair without meeting two or three funerals on the road. Of the birth rate there is no information whatever. Since the dispensary has been opened, the majority of the applicants have been eye cases and ulcers, septic sores being a good second. \During the year under review, small-pox made its usual appearance and carried off a good many infants. Only two adult deaths were reported. The district has a male and female vaccinator, but the vaccine that they have been supplied with this year has never taken, so far as I have been informed, in a single instance. The intense dislike all have for any isolation renders treatment difficult, and an outbreak is invariably characterised by the families concealing themselves. There is a great deal of venereal disease, and this is especially evident among the Shabanah recruits. The victims, however, are very willing to be treated. So far as information is available, infection comes largely from the “ amateur prostitute.” The professional prostitute is very scarce, probably not more than six throughout the whole district, and as they carry on their trade absolutely secretly it is difficult to get any accurate information. Preventive measures are, therefore, exceedingly difficult. Prevention of Disease .—Any attempts to deal with this very important part of general health has been rendered very difficult by the lack of staff. One compounder acting as S.A.S. can hardly be expected to do such. All of the inspection work has, therefore, fallen on the hands of the Assistant Political Officer and his deputies, who, not being medical men, can only make amateur efforts. In Jatarah, Abu Sukhair and Umm al Batrur, food inspection has been carried out daily. This was particularly necessary with regard to the vegetable market, which disposed of the most awful filth to the wretched poor. Shop inspection was the next step. This is also a daily occurrence in each of the municipalities mentioned above. Both of these measures are, however, insignificant compared with the importance of opening up roads for light and air. This has been done in Umm al Ba‘rur to a remarkable extent. The enthusiasm of the Deputy A.P.O. has communicated itself to the people, with the result that the town, if not a garden city, is at least clean and healthy; and this has been done entirely by the people themselves. Ja‘arah being shut in on all sides by date trees, is a difficult problem, but measures are now being taken to open up a new road through the gardens which will ventilate the place. House sanitation is by the cesspit system. These cesspits are, however, mere pits dug in the ground, and are rarely cleaned. In several cases it has been found that there is direct connection between the cesspits and the canals. It will be evident, therefore, that, even for the municipal portion of the district, the proposed medical establishment will not be by any means sufficient, as it does not touch the sanitary organisation. The steps taken to ameliorate sanitary conditions have been the filling in of all depressions and disused canal-beds, the erection of public latrines, dustbins and incinerators. The latter were a necessity, as the cesspit system appeared to be impossible in view of the high level of the water-table. But at present the sanitary staff is- entirely untrained, and, though its existence has undoubtedly tended to make life more endurable, it is very far from efficient. For the coming year sanction has been asked for a cesspit cleaning staff in each municipality. As regards public health among the tribes, it is exceedingly difficult to get any data; suffice it to say that the conditions in the tribal village are almost indescribable. The sense of cleanliness appears to have been entirely omitted from the tribal psychology. . The animals live in the huts with the people; each hut is appallingly over crowded and surrounded by refuse. In most cases the village is situated on the edge of a canal or in the middle of a swamp. Infantile diarrhoea is the rule, and in one case, when a proper examination was carried out, malarial spleens were found in 93 per cent, of the children examined. The amelioration of such conditions can only be a matter of the far future, but the people are anxious for medical attention and European medicines, and are very willing to bring their children to be treated. The policy for the future seems to be in the direction of concentration entirely on the municipal centres, and ruthless destruction where necessary therein. Only the most sweeping measures will be of use and, in spite of compensation, will certainly be the cheapest in the end. That the people do appreciate better living conditions when they are obligatory is a hopeful sign for the future.100 On the future medical organisation, I am in no way competent to speak; but, if I might venture a suggestion, it is that attached to the future Najaf Hospital shall be a separate Sanitary Training School. This is undoubtedly the main line of attack. The climate of Shamiyah is excellent, and there is no reason why it should not become, if not a health resort, at least an area which will compare very favourably with any in India. But it must always be remembered that it is the most populated district in ‘Iraq, and that order and improved trade conditions are already attracting residents from other districts. It is certain that the municipal population will enormously increase in the next five years. 'Strenuous measures, therefore, on sanitary lines will have to be taken, but there is no jfiace that will so quickly repay any efforts. 9. Police. —A full report of the Na,jaf Police by Sergt. Fear who, since June, has been in charge, is added as an Appendix to this Report. Drafts of 25 and 30 men from the Baghdad and Kut Police formed the nucleus of the Najaf Police in February 1918, after the January riots, when they volunteered for service here. They are all Persians or Kurds. They arrived amongst a population almost openly hostile to Government in a town where Police work is exceptionally difficult. Very shortly after their arrival occurred the March riots, when two of their number were murdered and all were in danger of losing their lives. The whole of their personal property was looted. After the cessation of the blockade, Sergt. Fear was placed in charge of them, and it is largely to his efforts that they owe their present efficiency. They are specially trained as armed town Police, and are capable of putting up a good show on parade and of moving as a company, in addition to the ordinary work of patrol and Police duty. They are housed in the Bohra khan just inside the Kufah Gate and facing the main square. The site is an ideal one for a Police barracks, and is capable of accommodating 200 men. Only three months ago in ruins (it was gutted by the Najafis in 1915), it has been^excellently repaired, and is now one of the most imposing buildings in the town. The interior arrange ments are good, and it is doubtful if any force in the country is in possession of such fine quarters. The strength is now 65, but this is by no means adequate for their arduous duties. The presence of an efficient and numerous Police force in Najaf is of high importance. The men must be outsiders, Persian or Kurds. The respectable element of the town is Persian. The experience of the Police during the riots is sufficient to ensure esprit de corps and loyalty in the future. It is hoped to run the internal Police work of Kufah from the same force; 150 men at least will be necessary to meet all requirements. It is not out of place here to call attention to the question of criminal investiga tion. Such work requires very special training and great experience, and the administration of a country is impossible without some such machinery. In Najaf and Kufah, Government is fortunate in possessing three Arab officers, ‘Abdul Wahab, and ‘Abdul Hadi, and ‘Amanah, who have verv fair abilities and qualifications for this type of work. They rank as Bimbashi, Yuzbashi, and Zabit of Shabanah, but will be brought on to Police establishment next year. The question of C.I.D. must also be faced. The Police during the last six months have been borne for disciplinary purposes on the lolls of the A.P.0., Shamiyah Shabanah. From the new year, however, they form part of the Mesopotamian Police Force, specially officered and trained. 10. Shabanah.— The original Shamiyah Shabanah were, as in the case of the rest of ‘Iraq, tribesmen providing their own arms and clothes, brought in by Shaikhs who were friendly to Government. Theoretically thev guarded the Political Officer, were capable of bringing offenders to justice, and of keeping order m the district. Practically they drew pay, wore a brass badge, had no discipline, knew no drill, and carried messages. In Shamiyah they were soon called upon to show if they possessed any other qualifications, and the result was not inspiring. Daring the riots they proved unreliable and useless, and those who were Najafis deserted m a body to the insurgents. In June, after the blockade, the situation was : a force of some 100 in Kufah, mostly townsmen and fairly reliable, though not of much use; and of about 150 in Abu Sukhair and the district, all tribesmen and exceptionally wild. None had uni orm, an i. ic lac leen no attempt at training as the training personnel was not m existence. They were armed, if at all, with gas pipes.Captain MacWhinnie had a detachment of about 50 trained Hillah men at Najaf. It soon became apparent that an attempt must be made to train and to discipline the actual Shamiyah men. The existence of trained Hillah men at Najaf under a British officer and of a large undisciplined, but armed, rabble throughout the Division very little controlled and of not much practical use, was an anomaly. At the same time the Division was being re-organised with Najaf as headquarters. At Najaf itself little training could be done. It is an unpleasant place for the men to live in, food is dear, and water a real difficulty. Therefore when the headquarters of the Division moved to Najaf, Captain MacWhinnie moved down to Kufah, which was made the Shabanah headquarters of the Division, and assumed charge of the whole Shamiyah Shabanah. It still remained to be seen, however, what would be the outlook of the men themselves on the new order of things, and the prospects of drill, discipline, and uniform. With the object of going slow, the Abu -Sukhair men had been excluded temporarily from the sweeping reforms it was hoped to introduce until it could be seen how they would be taken. Captain MacWhinnie has well described in his report the difficulties that he went through, and how he finally succeeded not only in overcoming prejudice but also in creating enthusiasm. Suffice it to say that, after the initial stages had passed, the men rapidly learnt drill and clamoured for uniform, and no difficulty whatever was experienced in getting the Abu Sukhair men to come into line. The fact that the Division was largely untrodden ground, its size, the difficulty of communications, and the density of the population, all made it difficult to fix upon a suitable number for a Shabanah force, and several revisions were necessary. The final sanctioned number is 722, composed of 13 officers, 589 piada, and 122 sawari. The numbers at present stand at some 550. The effort throughout has been to make Kufah the central training ground, but the necessity of having men continually on duty throughout the Division has made concentration difficult. B.O.R.s are therefore stationed at Umm al Ba‘rur and Abu Sukhair, and train the men there. This system has worked well, but a great increase in efficiency will be secured when we have sufficient numbers to permit of a man being in for training six months in the year, and out on district work the other six. The amount of duties undertaken by the Shamiyah Shabanah may be gauged when it is realised that the guard duties of 280 troops have been taken over, and that there are some 15 to 20 small posts (including the Qusur) throughout the Division. At present the duties of the Shabanah are providing patrols on the desert line, guarding Government houses and property such as offices and bridges, garrisoning small posts, providing escorts, and arresting offenders. They are also trained to work as a body and especial attention is paid to training in guard duties. They are a smart, well-clothed, well-disciplined, and useful force. That they have become so when every condition seemed adverse is entirely due to the efforts of Captain MacWhinnie, and Lieut. White, who, later, joined as bis assistant. The British personnel employed is two British officers and five B.O.R.s. An additional British officer is urgently called for. - The efficiency of Shabanah in small posts, a necessary condition in this Division, depends upon constant inspection and touring on the part of the officers. It may be mentioned that to tour and inspect every post in the Division, including the Qusur, takes 12 days, going hard. It is hoped that the Police will soon be able to take over all duties at Najaf, and this will release more Shabanah for training and district work. The Division is w~eak in Sow T ari, and Government aid in horses will be called for if we are successfully to staff the Qusur line. The need of Shabanah barracks at Kufah capable of accommodating 400 men is a very urgent one. There is no suitable Government building. There is, how ever, a suitable site and the construction of barracks on a modern plan should be taken in hand as soon as possible. Till then, it is suggested that housing in E.P. tents would be suitable. A permanent camp could be set up without difficulty, and this would certainly improve the comfort as well as the discipline of the men, in addition to releasing some of the occupied houses to their proper owners. The Arab officer is a real difficulty, and I am in full agreement with Captain MacWhinnie that a central training school is called for. Captain MacWhinnie’s report is added as an Appendix.tm 102 11. Labour. —Such irrigation works as have been undertaken have been constructed by means of tribal labour organised by the Political Officers. The small demands of other departments in the area, such as I.W.T. and Resources, have been similarly met without difficulty. It should, however, be fully realised in the future that the provision of a large amount of labour for extensive irrigation works is a matter of great difficulty and the potential source of unrest in this area. Every man is a cultivator in its fullest sense, that is a settled cultivator, the great variety of crop giving him a full day’s work most of the year. The date harvest, shitwi cultivation, rice-growing, which is an intense labour, the rice harvest, and, above all, the security and upkeep of his intricate irrigation sj^stem—all tend to drive him hard. He has not yet seen the advantages of scientific irrigation, and it is improbable that he will willingly dig on projects which in his heart of hearts he distrusts. 12. Miscellaneous : (a) Pilgrimages .—The number of pilgrimages to Najaf is large, and there is a tradition that for every true and faithful Muhammadan any day throughout the whole year is a day for pilgrimage. The special days in Najaf which attract thousands and thousands of pilgrims from all parts of Shi‘ah world are five in number, as follows :— (1) Td al Ghadir on the 18th of Zui-Hajah (September). It is said that on that day the Prophet Muhammad, when returning from his last pilgrimage from Mecca, publicly announced to his followers that his successor and Khalif after him was his cousin and son-in-law, ‘Ali. The meaning of Ghadir is a pool, and the Prophet on his way to Madinah presumably made this announcement at some famous well. (2) Maulud, the birthday of the Prophet on the 17th of Rabi-al-Awal (December). This should be a pilgrimage day for Madinah, where Muhammad is buried; but as Madinah is not within the reach, so Najaf is chosen instead, as ‘All is not only the cousin and son-in-law, but also the successor of Muhammad. (3) MaVuth on the 27th of Rajab (April). On this day it is stated that Muhammad began to preach Muhammadism among the Quraish tribe. Same as in No. 2. (4) New Year’s Day. On 21st of March. It is the Persian New Year Day. But there is a tradition that on this day ‘Ali was made successor of the Prophet Muhammad. (5) YY afat, on 21st of Ramadhan. On this day ‘Ali died from his wounds, which he received on the forehead on 19th Ramadhan from ‘Abdul Rahman ibn Muljim. Both Ramadhan and Muharram, especially the latter, are observed with great strictness in lYajaf and also in the Division, most work and business being at a standstill and the bazaars closed. Arabain is also celebrated and all other Wafats. Energetic administration is difficult at such times. (b) The Oudh Bequest. Two distributions of this charity were made in Najaf during 1918, in March and November, the sums paid out being Rs. 49,892/2/- and Rs. 62,264/4/- respectively. Mr. Thaddeus and his staff came down specially on each occasion, and he has dealt with the subject fullv in his reports. The future method of distribution is, however, deserving of serious consideration. The six-monthly arrangement is unsatisfactory, and compares very unfavourably with the system of administration of the many other large charities in Najaf Agam now thal Government is established the need for Residency members ceases, ilujtahid distributors have their uses, but the filling up of any vacant posts should not be undertaken without mature consideration: There are actually only two real Mujtahids among the Mujtahid distributors. It is highly improbable that a real Mujtahid will accept such a posk-it is regarded in the common mind as an open kind of Government pay and an influential Mujtahid will stand to lose more than he gams. But such posts can very usefully be bestowed among such of the Mutadaym as are deserving, and who will not lose much by the acceptance of such a post. In the future a three-monthly distribution, through the Political Officer, who is m an excellent position to know deserving cases, is called for. (c) Najaf Press.—XJnAev orders of the Civil Commissioner early in the next year an Arabic press will be established at Najaf. This will be solely for the printing of religious books written in Najaf, and approved by the ‘Ulama of Najaf.This will supply a very great want, and the institution of the press will undoubtedly give very great satisfaction. (d) Buildings, Najaf. The buildings erected during the year are :— Somerset House.- This was begun by the Turks as a school and has been completed by us with Persian arched roofing, it now forms the Government offices. There are 12 large rooms, admirably planned, which provide accommodation at present for the Political Officer, Assistant Political Officer, of Personal Assistant to the Political Officer, and their offices, the Auqaf, Baladiyah, Revenue, and a waiting room for Shaikhs. The cost was Rs. 12,600/-. MarshaWs Sarai . —-0riginally ‘Atiyah’s khan. Extensive alterations have been undertaken and it now accommodates the Political Officer and Assistant Political Officer, the B.O.R.s, a wireless section, and a platoon. There is a garage and ample store room. The amount spent has been Rs. 8,623/4/6. The Bohr a A/icm.—Two wings of this have been repaired at a cost of Rs. 8,750/-, and it now houses the Najaf Police, and a portion of it is used as the Post Office. The Civil Dispensary .was the old Turkish sarai, and was completely gutted in the riots. It has been rebuilt and fulfils its present purpose well. Rs. 6,000/- were expended on this. The old Turkish quarters at the Bab-al-Thalmah have also been repaired, and house the Shabanah stationed in Najaf. Abu Sukhair .—The sarai has been repaired at a cost of about Rs. 500/-. Here are situated the Government offices. The old sarai has been completely repaired at a cost of Rs. 4,000/-, part for use as the Divisional jails and part for Shabanah quarters. Abu Shorah. —Shu‘bah and Shabanah quarters have been built here at a cost of Rs. 2,000/-. The former is burnt brick and the latter sun-dried brick. Umm al Ba‘rar .—Excellent Shabanah quarters have been constructed here at a cost of Rs. 2,000/-. 13. Establishment and Personnel. —A sketch of the present administrative system has been given in Chapter I. The Political Officer has his headquarters in Najaf, and is assisted by a gazetted officer. Part II., for Najaf affairs, Hamid Khan. Under him, directly, also works the Government Agent, Subbi Effendi, for the Desert. The remainder of the Political Officer’s staff is clerical and consists of two English-speaking clerks and a vernacular clerk. The P.A. to the P.O. control the vernacular staff of two vernacular clerks, and the Government Agent, Qusur, has a vernacular clerk. The A.P.O. of the Najaf-Kufah municipal area, with headquarters at Najaf, has under him as gazetted officers, Part II., personal assistants or municipal officers for Najaf and Kufah. The former is more in the nature of a personal assistant, and his office is included in the office establishment of the A.P.O. himself. This consists of an English head clerk, an English-speaking accountant and his assistant, and a treasurer. The Municipal Officer at Kufah has under him a translator and a vernacular clerk. Each Municipal Officer controls the Baladiyah staff and the Revenue estab lishment of the municipal area in his town. The Auqaf and the Police establishment work directly under the A.P.O., who therefore controls the Baladiyah, Sanitary, and Revenue staffs through his assistants, and Auqaf, Police, and the Accounts and Treasury branches direct. In the district the unit of administration is the Shu‘bah. There are six of these, each staffed at present with a mamur and sub-mamur, a clerk, two qolchi bash is, 12 qolchis, and a qawass, except in the Shuffiahs of Kufah and Hor al Dukhn, where the two qolchi bashis .are mounted and four mounted qolchis replace the 12 foot qolchis. The three Shu‘bahs on the eastern river are administered by the D.A.P.O., Eastern Shamiyah, at Umm al Ba‘rur, who has under him a Revenue headquarters’ staff consisting of a head accountant and a clerk and a political staff of a vernacular clerk and a treasurer. The three Shuffiahs on the Western river come under the D.A.P.O., Western Shamiyah, at Abu Sukhair, who has a similar staff to the other D.A.P.O. without the treasurer, a large central treasury existing at Abu Sukhair,104 and economy of working is called for. Each D.A.P.O. controls his municipalities direct. The A.P.O. at Abu Sukhair in charge of the district has a clerical establishment under him of an accountant, a treasurer, two English-speaking clerks, a translator and two vernacular clerks. His Mudir Mai or revenue adviser has one clerk. The A.P.O. of the district, therefore, controls through his deputies, who are responsible for revenue administrative and Baladiyah work in their areas. He deals direct with all case work except minor criminal offences. The A.P.O. Shabanah has a British Officer and five B.O.Rs. to assist him. The medical staff consists of a Sub-Assistant Surgeon and a compounder at Najaf and compounders at Kufah and Abu Sukhair. The size of the Division calls for increase of staff next year as several of the Shu‘bahs are unwieldy. It is intended to split the Umm al BaTur Shu‘bah into two and to form another Shu‘bah out of the lower portions of the Ghammas and Mishkhab Shuffiah, making eight Shu‘bahs in all. At the same time further British Officers are required; the A.P.O. district should have two assistants on each river, one always able to be on tour and the other at headquarters. The very large amount of work at Najaf also necessitates a British Officer being given to the A.P.O. in charge of the municipalities to assist him, a health officer and a municipal engineer. The Officer in charge of Shabanah needs another assistant, and the police should be under the charge of a trained British Police Officer. The minimum medical establishment should be a Civil Surgeon at Najaf, with staff of a Sub-assistant Surgeon and two compounders at each of the towns of Kufah, Najaf, Abu Sukhair and Umm al BaTur. In the Shu‘bahs each mamur should have two assistants instead of one. Appendix VIII. gives the proposed organisation. 14. Conclusion.— The Division has suffered many vicissitudes in the course of the year. There have, however, been practical results. Nearly 8,000 tons of revenue grain, over half of which is rice, have been collected in kind, and some four and a half lakhs revenue in cash. The Auqaf establishment has controlled over a lakh, wdiile the monthly receipts from Baladiyah taxation have been over Rs. 12,000/-. An efficient Shabanah force of 550 men has been created, while the nucleus of a police force now exists. Very large municipal improvements have been undertaken and have already proved remunerative, and with even the scanty medical and sanitary staff a large number of cases have been successfully treated, and there has been considerable benefit to the public health of the towns from the sanitary arrangements made. Next year will inevitably see a large increase in municipal receipts and consequently municipal improvements, while, given a sufficiency of water, the revenue should far exceed last year’s.APPENDIX I.

The Shi‘ah Mujtahid is he who has the power of promulgating an ijtihad, that is, a religious order. This is the essential difference between the Sunni and Shi‘ah forms of Muhammadanism. The former follow the interpretation of the Muhammadan laws laid down by the four original founders of the four sects of Sunni Islam, that is by Hambali, Shafai, Hanafi and Malaki. These are immutably. The Shi‘ah, on the other hand, follow the laws of the Quran as interpreted by the Imams, and these laws again, or, rather, some of them, may be interpreted or modified by the Mujtahids as they think fit. They, however, seldom exercise this privilege. For instance, Shafai states that tobacco is haram, and to this day the Shafais do not smoke. But there is no mention of tobacco in the Quran; there is, therefore, no prohibition to Shi‘ahs smoking. But when the Persian Government gave the tobacco monopoly to a Russian Company, Mirza Hasan Shirazi, the great Mujtahid of his time, issued a Fatwah forbidding the use of tobacco by the Shi‘ahs on the ground that it was haram to have given the monopoly to non-Muslims. This Fatwah was obeyed and resulted in the Persian Government cancelling the monopoly and compensating the Russian company. The Fatwah was then withdrawn. No Sunni divine could have done this. Again, as regards alcohol, there are many instances where Mujtihids have given Fatwahs permitting its use for sick persons for whom there was no other cure. The Shi‘ah Mujtahid may interpret the law. The Sunni may only follow slavishly the law as it has been interpreted for him. Theoretically Mujtahids are only of one grade, but, actually, they fall into three recognised classes, in accordance with the influence they possess and the numbers who follow them. A Mujtahid can only obtain recognition as such by certificates from the greatest Mujtahids of his time that he is a Mujtahid, that he is capable of giving the Fatwah. This is usually the result of anything up to 25 years’study in Najaf, and Najaf only, under the great Mujtahids. During this time his character must have been exemplary. Solitude is a necessity for the acquisition of such a character, and it therefore follows automatically that no man of good family ever becomes a Mujtahid. The next step of the certificated Mujtahid is on the death of a great Mujtahid to gather round himself learned men and to send them out to various parts of the world to preach his fame. His influence, if he is lucky, gathers in volume like a snowball, until finally he is recognised by universal acclamation as one of the great Mujtahids. There are a certain number of religious learned Shi‘ahs, commonly, but wrongly, known as Mujtahids. They are properly “ Muttadaiyin ” or pious men, fit to receive charity and to settle minor sharah cases but not to decide (^^). The great Mujtahids to-day are Saiyid Kadhim Yazdi of Najaf; Mirza Muhammad Taqi Shirazi • of Samarra, now in Karbala ; Saiyid Ism‘ail Sadr of Karbala, now in Kadhimain; and Shaikh Shari‘at al Isfahani of Najaf. They are addressed as— “ Hujjat al Islam wa mushmin, ayatullah fil ‘alimin.” The second class are such as Shaikh ‘Ali al Shaikh Muhd. Ridha, Shaikh ‘All Hulli. They are known as— “ Hujjat al Islam wa muslimin.” The third class are “ Muttadaiyin,” such as Shaikh Mahdi Kashmiri, addressed as— “ Dhiqat al Islam.” X IO 1162—1 H 3106 / if The descendants of Mujtahids are not often Mujtahids, though they retain influence and are respected through their family. Such instances are the Bahr al ‘Ulum, Kashif al Ghata an S Jawahir families. The residence of the great Mujtahids need not always be m a ja , amarra, Karbala, Kadhimain or Mashhad being often chosen. But the great Mujtahid of his time must always live in Najaf Karbala or Samarra, preferably the former. R. Wingate, I.C.S., Political Officer, Shamiyah. APPENDIX III. Prominent Personalities in Najaf and Shamiyah. Saiyid Muhammad Kadhim al Tabatabai al Yazdi. —The greatest Shi ah Mujtahid of the day, and of paramount influence throughout the whole of Shi c ah Islam, his sole possible rival being the aged Mirza Muhammad Taqi Shirazi of Samarra, who has possibly as many followers in Persia, but whose influence can never equal that of Saiyid Kadhim’s for the simple reason that the latter is a Saiyid. It is remarkable that in Persia, M. Muhammad Taqrs influence is entirely among the higher classes, Yazdi’s among the common people. Saiyid Kadhim is extremely aged, but of vigorous intellect, great learning and of very pleasing manner. His habits are simple to a degree. He is exceptionally broadminded, and to those whom he knows well and trusts he will give invaluable advice and candid opinions. To writing he will not commit himself, and no attempt should ever be made to make him do this. He will certainly refuse, and it must be remembered that the power of such a man lies in his open neutrality and disassociation from political affairs. Should he once abandon this, his influence will deteriorate, and his value will diminish. He is at heart pro-British and very anti-Turk. Since the deposition of Muhammad ‘Ali Shah, when verbally, though not in writing, he expressed disapprobation of the constitutionalists, he has never taken any part in politics, and has even ceased entirely to correspond with the Persian Government. Any attempt to make him do this is foredoomed to failure. He does not even answer requests for advice sent to him by the Persian Government, and undoubtedly, at heart, is a hater of the constitutionahsts, and a staunch royalist. His remark to Colonel Stokes was characteristic when, on the latter saying that he was in Persia at the time of the constitution, he replied: “ Yes, when Persia began to go back.” His “ hakamtu ” on a shar‘ah case is final, but he will not give a decision against the decision of such a man as M. Muhammad Taqi. In the case of there being established a Shi‘ah Court in Baghdad, it must be remembered that Shi‘ai have the right, which they will certainly exercise, of appeal to the great Mujtahids. He distributes yearly at least one hundred thousand pounds in charity. Shaikh al SharYat al Isfahani. —The second most important Mujtahid in Najaf and the fourth in the Shi‘ah world. He was made a Mujtahid through the influence of the constitutionalists, who at the time were badly in need of Mujtahids to support them. A very learned man and well educated in other matters besides religion. Distinctly weak-minded and prone to interference in political affairs, and to intrigues sub rosa against Saiyid Kadhim. He took a prominent part in the Jihad, but owing to pressure and bribery. It is impossible to say whether he is pro-anything at heart, except money, and is liable to give an opinion on the spur of the moment through weakness, an opinion which he afterwards regrets. He should be treated with great care, and it should be remembered that in reality he has no influence, his name being only a centre around which intrigues can be woven, his vanity being played upon with the idea that the addition of his name to such and such a pronouncement will result in considerable elevation for himself. Intrigues will always centre round him, owing to the fact that Saiyid Kadhim and M. Muhammad Taqui are entirely aloof from such influences. He is an O.B. Mujtahid distributor, and his acceptance of this post was due solely to the fact that his influence is so little as to bring him in practically no charity. His son Shaikh Kassan is mad. Shaikh 'Ali al Shaikh Muhammad Ridha Kashif al Ghata. —Head of the family of Shaikh Ja‘far al Kabir, the greatest Mujtahid of his time. The latter is perhaps best known for refusing to declare the Dafa‘ against Russia about one hundred years ago, on the ground that the Russians were only fighting for territory, and not religion. Shaikh ‘Ali is a learned and good-hearted old man, and has the largest library in Najaf. He has great influence among the tribes, both owing to his own personal worth and owing to his family. He is very anti-Turkish, and was often humiliated by them. He is openly pro-British. His two sons, Shaikh Ahmed and Shaikh Muhammad Husain are ‘alims, and have very great influence with Saiyid Kadhim, who invariably consults them on every matter. Shaikh Ja'far al Shaikh Radhi. —An Arab ‘alim of similar influence to Shaikh ‘Ah among the tribes. He interferes in no way in political affairs. Shaikh 'Ali al Hilli. —Originally from Hillah; as Shaikh Ja‘far, though not so well known. Saiyid Salih Hilli. —An Arab ‘alim, entirely occupied in religious affairs. Shaikh Hasan Sahib al Jiwahir. —A respectable Mujtahid of famous family. O.B. Mujtahid distributor. Very pro-British, but of no influence. Shaikh Jawad Sahib al Jawahiv. —The cleverest man in Najaf, and capable of any unscrupulous action for the sake of money. Quite unafraid of unpopularity. He would be extremelv valuable if he were not so utterly unreliable. He invariably interferes in politics, and no intrigue can be carried on without his knowledge.Saiyid ''Abdul Rassaq al Hallu. —An Arab ‘alim. Before the war he had no name, but during the war, by interfering in political matters, and in the Jihad, he became prominent. He is probably pro-Turkish. Shaikh ''Abdul Karim Jazairi. —Before the war he was a great friend of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, but, as the result of the bribes by the Turks, turned his enemy. Very prominent as an enemy propagandist before the fall of Baghdad. His brother, Shaikh . Muhammad Jawad, was arrested in connection with the captured documents found with the German Political Office in ‘Anah. Haji Agha Mahmud al Hindi. —O.B. Mujtahid distributor. He is related by marriage to Saiyid Kadhim. Openly pro-British, and an admirer of the British Government. He acts as Saiyid Kadhim’s secretary in his correspondence with Government. He has rendered excellent services, both in September 1917 and during the Blockade. He may be relied upon. He is good hearted, but it should always be remembered that he is not influential, nor can he ever become so. Shaikh Mahdi al Shaikh Asadidlah. —O.B. Mujtahid distributor. A respectable man, but of no influence. At hearty admirer and supporter of the British Government, but very weak and liable to go with the majority. Shaikh Hasan al Shaikh Fazil Sharabyani. —Respected because of the great name and reputation of his father, a Persian from Tabriz. His father was the greatest ‘alim of his time. He is well known in all parts of Persia, especially Tabriz. Saiyid Ja'far Bohr al ‘‘Ulum. —Of the famous family of Bahr al ‘Ulum, and so respected. O.B. Mujtahid distributor. Pro-British, and one of the very few who seems to have the courage of his convictions.

Shaikh Ja'far Budairi. —Ditto. Shaikh Mahdi Kashmiri. —O.B. Mujtahid distributor, and a British subject. His life was dangerous prior to the fall of Baghdad. Pro-British, but of no influence whatever. His brother, Ttamad al Islam, in Teheran, is influential. Mirza Mahdi Ayatullahzadah Khurasani. —Son of Ayatullah Akhund Mulla Kadhim Khurasani, the greatest Mujtahid of his time, and famous as the leader of the constitutionalist party. Akhund was a remarkable man, and a large amount of the success of the constitutionalist party was due to his championship. His influence as a Mujtahid, however, decreased in proportion as his interference in politics increased, and it was on the ruins of his power that Saiyid Kadhim rose. In dealing with Saiyid Kadhim, or with Mirza Mahdi, it is well to remember this fact. Mirza Mahdi himself is well known in Persia. He is not particularly clever, but thoroughly untrustworthy, and lives in intrigue. His relations with the Shaikhs of Najaf were by no means such as to endear him to the lovers of order and justice. All communications between the Persian capital and ‘Iraq are made through him. He is not an ‘alim. His brother Agha Najafi is the greatest Mujtahid in Khurasan. His younger brother, Mirza Ahmad of Najaf, is an ‘alim. Shaikh Ishaq Ayatullah Zadah Rashti.—Son of Haji Mirza Habibullah Rashti, the greatest ‘alim of his time. His brother, Shaikh IsnTail, who died lately in Teheran, was one of the leaders of the Democratic party. He is not very influential, and probably anti-British.

Shaikh Ali Kumi.—A Persian Mujtahid enjoying considerable respect, who does not interfere in politics. Bait Saiyid 'Ali Agha Damad Ta&amp;nzi.—Saiyid ‘Ali died at the beginning of 1918. He was prominently pro-Turkish. His son, Saiyid Murtaza, is a doubtful character. Saiyid 'Ali al Saiyid Muhammad Khakim Tabatabai. —Eldest son of Yazdi, an alim respected and aloof from politics. Shaikh Ja'far al Shaikh Jawad al Kazimi.—A third class ‘alim, now in ‘Amarah. Probably pro-Turkish. Shaikh 'Abdullah Mamaghani .— Son of Shaikh Hasan Mamaghani, one of the greatest ‘alims of his time. Concerned only in religion, and has many followers in Azerbaijan. Saiyid Muhsin Qazwini- —Head of the Qazwini family in Najaf. His brother, Saiyid Muhammad ‘Ah of Hillah, and his uncle, Saiyid Hadi of Hindiyah, are well known and influential. Shaikh Muhammad, son of Ayatullah Haji Mirza Husain Haji Mirza Khalil Tehrani.—His father was a well known ‘alim, and one of the leaders of the constitutionalist paity. He is well known in Persia, where he has now gone. His brother, Muhammad Taqi, is respected in Teheian. Bait Safi. —Students whose activities should be kept trace of. Shaikh Baqir Kamusi.—A Baghdad ‘alim residing in Najaf. Of little importance. H 4108 Saiyid Muhammad Taqi. —Of the family of Sadat Shah 'Abdul Azimi. Much respected. Shaikh Muhammad Harez.- —An Arab ‘alim, aloof from politics. Saiyid Hashim al Hindi. —A British subject, given to intrigue, with an undue idea of his own importance. In reality of no influence whatever. Ashraf and Merchants and Shaikhs of Najaf. Bait Nizam ud daulah. —Nizam ud daulah, grandfather of Hamid Khan, was Sadr A‘zam to Muhammad Shah (nephew of Fath ‘Ali Shah) and the richest man in Persia. He married a daughter of Fath ‘Ali Shah. At the age of 28 his power and wealth were such that, as usual in Persia, a conspiracy was set on foot to overthrow and to murder him. This probably would have succeeded, but, through the good offices of the British and Russian embassies, he and his family succeeded in escaping via Baghdad to Najaf, at which place he took up his residence. He was a man of great learning, and eventually became a Mujtahid, the only recorded instance of a man of distinguished family attaining this degree. His son was known for this reason as Nizam ul Ulem. The family are very large landlords, and the most famous and honoured in Najaf. The present representative is Hamid Khan, the P.A. to the P.O., whose knowledge of Najaf and its characters is as unique as it is invaluable. Saiyid 'Abbas Kiliddar {Rafaii Family): 'Amarah quarter .—The richest family in Najaf. He has done excellent service since the fall of Baghdad, and is certainly pro-British. At times he is a bar, but he is better than his uncle. Saiyid Hadi Naqib al Ashraf: 'Amarah quarter. —Uncle of the Kiliddar. In reality a great supporter of Government, but pitifully weak and vacillating, and consequently useless when he is most needed. Not possessed of much intelligence. There is open enmity between him and the Kiliddar, and no remarks by either about the other should ever be listened to. Both he and the Kiliddar must be strongly backed by Government to be of any use at all. Bait Sha'ban: ‘Amarah quarter. —Khadims in the Mosque and merchants. Two of the family, ‘Abdul Rasul and Hasan, are bad characters. Bait Habubi: Hawaish quarter. —Merchants. The most prominent is Saiyid ‘Ah al Saiyid Muhammad Sa‘id. Saiyid Muhammad was most fanatical in the Jihad, and died at Nasariyah. Suspected of trading with Ibn Rashid. Bait Shamsah : Mushraq quarter. —Khadims in the Mosque and landlords. A respectable family. Haji ‘Abdul Razzan is Rais Baladiyah of Najaf, has done excellent work, and can be relied upon. Bait Kammunah : Mushraq quarter. —Khadims in the Mosque, landlords and petty traders. Mulla Shakir: Mushraq quarter. —The direct descendant of Mulla Muhammad Kiliddar, and almost King of Najaf about 60 years ago. Mulla Shakir was thoroughly in with the Najaf Shaikhs, and used his power unscrupulously during their rule to loot and to obtain property. Thoroughly untrustworthy. Bait ‘Ajinah : Buraq gwrfer.—Respectable merchants. The head of the family is Haji Muhammad Said. Bait Naji: Buraq quarter .—Large grain merchants. Strongly suspected of trading with Ibn Rashid. Haji Muhsin Shallash : Buraq quarter. —The richest financier and merchant in Najaf. He did invaluable work during the Blockade. A man of great acumen and well versed in affairs. He can be relied upon to give sound advice, and to be of great assistance in the matter of municipal improvements and projects. He is the manager of the tramway company, and has his finger in every pie. In political matters he is, however, unreliable, as also, very naturally, in matters which may affect his own pocket, one way or the other. He should therefore be treated with considerable care, as, owing to his great interests, there are very few matters which do not affect him, and it is valuable to find out what his interests may be in any particular matter before seeing him himself. His brother, Haji Rauf, is able, but entirely overshadowed by Haji Muhsin. Saiyid Mahdi al Saiyid Salman: Huwaish quarter .—Read of Saiyid Salman family. A many-faced liar, unreliable and cunning, but a supporter of Government. A great lover of money, to obtain which he undertakes any responsibility and risks. Hereditary head of the Zuqurt. He is one of the famous four Shaikhs of Najaf. During the Blockade he could have assisted the Government in many ways but did not use his influence in the best way possible. Proverbially well known as mean and a miser! Saiyid Hadi ibn Saiyid Muhammad : Huwaish quarter.—Re is from Saiyid Sajman’s family and a nephew of the above. J ’ His behaviour during the Blockade not satisfactory. Saiyid 'Abub and Saiyid Kadhim: Huwaish quarter .—Rons, of Saiyid Mahdi Saiyid Salman. Vaguely reported, but not confirmed, as having taken part in the conspiracy which resulted in the murder of Captain Marshall. Saiyid 'Abdul Husain ibn Saiyid 'Ali : Hmvaish quarter.—Also from family of Saiyid His conduct during the Blockade suspicious. Haji Hassun Sharbah : Huwaish quarter .—Read of Sharbah family, who are Zuqurts a unreliable, but, oddly enough, his conduct during the Blockade good. Ghaidan 'Adwah : Huwaish quarter .—Read of the ‘ Adwah family, and a Zuqurt Two of deported. Entirely unreliable and a lover of money. ^ Salman, liar and his sonsSamawi Abu Shobah : Huwaish quarter. —Head of the Abu Shobah family, a powerful family in Huwaish. A Zuqurt. Five of the family deported. Harmless and a liar. Salman Abu Ghanim : ‘Amarah quarter. —A great friend of ‘Atiyah, but forsook him on the occupation of Baghdad. Now a trader and harmless. One of his relations, Muhsin abu Ghanim, was hanged, and another deported. ‘Asmi ibn Haji ''Atiyah : i Amarah quarter. —The only surviving son of Haji ‘Atiyah. A young lad of about 16, declared an outlaw. His mother, ‘Aftah, is prominent in intrigue. He should be arrested when found. Haji Ghanim Kirmashah : Huwaish quarter. —Head of the Kirmashah family, and a Zuqurt. All of his relations deported, except two. Old but not harmless. 1 Abdullah Najam Shumurti: Mishraq quarter. —The most prominent member of the Shumurts left. A thorough bad hat. Hasan al Salih : Mishraq quarter. —Ditto. Saiyid ‘AZi Jarau : Buraq quarter. —“ Henry VIII.” Implicated in all the disturbances with his relations,. Of no importance now, but entirely untrustworthy. Saiyid Sa'id al Saiyid Husain: Buraq quarter. —Zuqurt of the family of Saiyid Salman. A bad hat. Haji ’’Abdullah al Haji Humadi: Buraq quarter. —Shumurt. He did excellent work in the Blockade, when he surrendered almost all the prominent persons. His cousin, Muhsin ibn Najam, also did well. Bait Najam: Buraq quarter. —Merchants. The head is Mulla ‘Aziz. Of no particular importance. Shamiyah Personalities. Nur al Saiyid ’Aziz.—-The most prosperous and respected of the Sadat in the district. Shi‘ah. Owns large area of land above the Ibrahim on the right bank of the Mishkhab. Fine cultivator and gives an appearance of great worth and solid judgment. In reality of little intellectual capacity, an empty barrel, whose pomposity is used by clearer headed and cleverer people for their own ends. The family name is Yasir; they are Zaidiyah, descended from Yahya ibn Zaid ibn ‘Ali. The family came from Madinah, six generations ago, settled first near Diwaniyah, then moved to Samawah. Saiyid Nur moved to. the Mishkhab and so did his relation Saiyid 'Abbas. Husain Muqotar, Saiyid. —Owns considerable land in the south of Shu‘bat Ghammas and is agent for all Muqotar lands. Shi‘ah. Age about 34. An excellent cultivator, and very shrewd business man. Somewhat given to intrigue. His uncle Saiyid Hadi Q.V. is known to be pro-Turk, but his own complicity in Turkish intrigue is less certain. He would be difficult to replace for agricultural work. Both he and Saiyid Hadi were suspected of intriguing with ‘Ajaimi al Sa‘dun and interned in India in July 1918. Hadi Muqotar, Saiyid—Oi Shinafiyah, land-owning Saiyid. Six generations back the father of Muqotar, Shochah, founded Lamlum on the Shatt al Hillah. That branch of the river having considerably diminished, Muqotar moved to the neighbourhood of the present Shinafiyah, where they now own very large properties. Saiyid Hadi lives at Shinafiyah. The Muqotar enjoyed the favour of the Ottoman Government, and were actively helpful to the Turks until we established effective control over the Middle Euphrates in November 1917. They then made submission in October 1917, promising to serve us as loyally as they had served their late rulers; but Saiyid Hadi was found to be in communication with ‘Ajaimi al Sa‘dun in December, and, though his letter of that date was overlooked, his great influence in Shinafiyah was reported to be directed covertly against us. He and his nephew, Saiyid Husain Q.V., were deported to India as civilian prisoners of war, 1st class, in July 1918. He was implicated in all the Najaf disturbances. Muhsin Abu Tabikh, Saiyid.—The largest landowner in Shu‘bat Ghammas. Shi‘ah. Age about 36. Has considerable influence, which he is ready to use at any time on behalf of Government, if it suits his pocket Thoroughly crafty and untrustworthy and should always be most carefully watched. His ruling passion is money. Pro-Turkish at heart, and was suspected of complicity in the plot to murder the P 0 s in the Shamiyah in February 1918, though there was no proof against him. A shrewd business man. The family moved up from the Hasa about 200 years ago; they own land at Rumaithah and Chamchah as well as in the Ghammas. Hadi Zuwain, Saiyid.—A man of about 40, head of a family of Mecca origin belonging to the well-known A‘raji house of Saiyids. His great grandfather founded Ja arah, where Saiyid Hadi now lives and by permission of Wadi, Shaikh of the Zubaid, at that time paramount in the Euphrates, brought the surrounding land under cultivation. The influence of the Zuwain extended at the time almost to Shinafiyah, but was curtailed when the Turks brought in the Fatlah and Ibrahim. Represented. Government interests in Sh&amp;miy&amp;h. before the Political Occupation of the District, but much given to intrigue, and has many enemies. Was involved in an apparently endless series oi disputes with his co-heirs and Falalih, which were satisfactorily settled in September 1918. Saiyid Hadi’s mother is of the Khaza‘il ruling house. The settlement of the case has largely undermined his position, which was at best an artificial one. Of little importance, and thoroughly disliked by the Ja‘arah populace. Not to be trusted. His outlook on life is limited to Saiyid Hadi. ‘ Abbas Zuwain Saiyid.—A distant cousin of Saiyid Hadi, with whom he is on bad terms. A more plastic type than Saivid Hadi, but none the less undesirable. He is almost as much disliked as the former but being less avaricious, o 2 more wealthy, is less oppressive to the people. At present honorary Rais Baladiyah of Ja‘arah in which position, for obvious reasons, he is eminently unsatisfactory. He will be replaced as soon as staff becomes available. He probably accepted this post to prevent Saiyid Hadi from intriguing against himself.Saiyid ‘Alwan al Saiyid ‘Abbas,—k.»e about 34. A well-read man of very charming manner. Has considerable land between al Fatlah and al Ibrahim on the left bank of the Mishkhab. Is a good culti vator. Related to Saiyid Nur Q.V. He was for a short time a representative for the Shamiyah in the wilayat council under the Ottoman Government. He conceals beneath his charm, guile and craftiness. For the Arab, a good brain with a very considerable influence. Probably in a quiet way the most influential man in Shamiyah. Saiyid Nur voices his thoughts. Not to be trusted, as his activities should be carefully watched. Mujbil al Fara‘un. —Head of the Fatlah tribe in the Mishkhab on the right bank of the river. He succeeded his brother Mubdir, who died in September 1918. Mizhir Q.V. is the elder brother, but his mental incapacity makes him unsuitable for the position. Mubdir was one of the best known men on the Euphrates, was frequently employed by the Turks as an unofficial intelligence officer, and for a short time represented the Shamiyah on the wilayat council. He was very useful to us immediately after the occupation. A fairly honest and not too intelligent personality, who is played upon by the astliter ‘Abdul Wahid. Mizhir al Fara‘un. —Elder brother of Mujbil. Cultivates on the right bank of the Mishkhab below the Shatt al Dubainiyah. Age about 40. 'A nonentity, being a half wit. ‘Ibadi al Husain. —Rais of the branch of the Fatlah settled on the Shamiyah Channel and owner of the prosperous village of Muhannawiyah. Extremely wealthy and a man of peace. A good cultivator, given to flattery, but loyal. ‘‘Abdul Sadah. —•Brother of above. Quiet, but fairly sound character and a good cultivator. i Abdul Wahid al Haji Sikah. —Son of the original paramount chief of the Fatlah, Haji Sikar, who was famous as one of the most powerful and probably the richest shaikh on the Euphrates. Cultivates a large area on the left bank of the Mishkhab from Abu Sukhair to the Ibrahim. Very able and more far-seeing than the average. Difficult type to analyse. Emphatically the most powerful of the Fatlah and, next to Saiyid ‘Alwan, probably the greatest influence in Mishkhab. A man of strong personahty, but at first sight appears weak and uninteresting. Should be always carefully watched, but when he gets used to the new regime, should be of considerable use to Government. Muhammad al ‘Abtan, Khaza‘il. —A man of considerable local influence, which was enhanced by a grant of Rs. 1,000/— p. m. from Government before we effectively occupied the country for protection of routes in his tract. The Shibil Shaikhs also used to turn to him. They probably will not in future. Age about 40. Lives at Abu Tibn. He and his brother Salman have had to pay up in the Diwaniyah fasl case, and their influence has suffered accordingly. A bad egg, who is definitely anti-English. Not a bad brain, which he uses only for his own purposes. Imprisoned 23rd December 1918 for general disobedience. The most powerful shaikh in Shamiyah. Salman al ‘Abtan. —Brother of above. He also used to draw an allowance of Rs. 1 ; 000 /- p. m. from Government, which has been discontinued; a rascal, his outlook on life is that of a naughty schoolboy. Not to be trusted anywhere out of sight. Imprisoned with the former. A great liar, but a very weak character. Salman al Dhahir. —The paramount shaikh of the Khaza‘il, but old and worn, and therefore does not take much interest in holding together the Khazadl. His fasl with Muhammad al ‘Abtan is now finished. Noted chiefly for his sense of justice and his honesty. Sha lan al Jabar. Of Al Ibrahim. Under the thumb of Saiyid ‘Alwan. Undisciphned and unimportant. Khadim al Mallakh. Does not appear much in public, but when he does, makes a good impression. The son of the late paramount shaikh, and one to whom, in consequence, consideration should be shown; strong enmity between him and Ali al Miz‘al, the present Shaikh. Jabbar Abu Hulail. A flabby individual, who ran away after imprisonment of the ‘Abtans. Is run by his son Madfun. Madfun. A bad egg; very erratic disposition, who has run away with is father, it is not known where. Hated by his tribesmen. Definitely anti-English, and a good riddance. 'Abid al Saiyid, Shaikh of the Cha'ab. —Took to himself the title of Saiyid about three years ago, to which, it is said, he has no claim whatever. A lazy, slippery, slimy and thoroughlv revolting personality. Haji Jawad al Masir. Rais of the Kurd and owner of the village of ‘Aqar. A fine cultivator. In character easily swayed, but at heart not a bad fellow. He and his brother Khadim and Marzuq al Awwad were deported to Baghdad in April for suspected complicity in the Najaf riots. Haji Jawwad and Marzuq were returned later. The effect upon them was most salutary. Marzuq al Awwad. Rais of the ‘Awabid. See above. A good cultivator, with a strong hold over his tribe Untrustworthy. For long he held the balance between the Fatlah and the Bani Hasan, the tribe who secured his services being certain to win. Alwan al Haji Sa dun. Of the Bait ‘Abbas, the Bani Hasan shaikhly house. He controls the section of the Bam Hasan south of Kifl-those north, follow his elder brother, ‘Umran Q.V., who is a honester man than Alwan, though not so able. In the days of no-Government, before we occupied the Euphrates towns m August 1917, he controlled affairs at Kufah, more or less, but was unable to deal effectively with the more unruly section of his tribe. With strong Government support he has done better; his intentions have always been good, but he is not a strong man, and while he will give an honest and unbiassed opinion on tribal affairs if he knows that he will not be quoted, he willl shut up hke an oyster if he thinks that Ins view mil be passed on to this own people. It is very probable that, m view of his position vis-a-vis to Laftah Shamkhi, who has no use for him at all, and is more powerful, p I 1 8 the 1 ^ S he can do ‘ He is v &lt;1 ' keen and intelligent agriculturist. He has been quoted by the German Rohtical Service as incorruptible. Is very much a gentleman to deal with. He lives near Kifl. Hishold over his tribe is by politics, not strength of character, and he is a procrastinator by nature. It is said that ‘Umran has to rely upon ‘Alwan for diplomacy and the usual tribal intrigues. Khadim al Ghazi. —Of the ‘Abbas family, the shaikhly house of the Bani Hasan. Kinsman of ‘Alwan. Lives near Abu Lokhah on the Shamiyah Channel. Not very prominent in tribal politics, but a keen cultivator, and enlightened. He should be shaikh of the Bani Hasan. Too close to Laftah Shamkhi to be really influential. Laftah al Shamkhi.- —Head of the Jarrah, the largest section of the Bani Hasan. Under Turkish rule Laftah was something of a firebrand, and gave trouble pretty constantly. Latterly he has suffered from poor health, and has been inclined to live in Kufah. It is probable that some of the intrigues which held to the Najaf riots of January and March were carried out in his country, and he wanted to be out of the way. Also we have backed ‘Alwan al Sa‘dun Q.V., and his nose is rather out of joint. He is fairly wild, but straight and outspoken. He has a very strong hold over his tribe, and is an exceptionally energetic cultivator, who will probably become rich. He has very greatly improved in the last six months, and gives promise of becoming a useful person. Quhaiyit ibn Wali. —Ghazalat, he and ‘Ali al Muzai‘il are the most prominent men of the tribe. Cultivates on the southern part of the Hor Sulaib. Is very much a wild man of the woods and is undependable. Was much engaged in importing food supplies to ‘Ajaimi Pasha. Lives south-east of Turumah. ‘AZi al Muzaiil. —Cultivates land on the Hor Umm Toq; lives at Turumah. He and Quhaiyit ibn Wali are the most prominent men of the tribe. Of quarrelsome temperament, and totally unreasonable. Has several enemies, one of whom, it is devoutly to be hoped, will shortly dispose of him. Needs a very heavy hand. ‘Aqaili al Raddam. —Cultivates land near Qurnah on the edge of the desert west of the Kufah Channel. His father, ‘Ulaiwi al Rukhaiyil, is still alive, but is stone blind and too old to manage affairs. ‘Aqaili is rather a crude specimen, but is more or less honest, and well disposed to the British Government. Hunain ibn Hannun. —Paramount chief of the Zaiyad. Cultivates on both sides of the Shamiyah Channel, near the bazaiz of the Ghammas. His tribe, like the Ibrahim, is purely river in stock and Hunain is only a slightly polished replica of his own adherents. Jarri al Muraiyi'. —Zaiyad of Ghammas. Cultivates the bazaiz of the Shatt al Hawi, on the east of Ghammas Channel. Keeps his people in good order and does not dabble in politics. APPENDIX IV.

Signed by Saiyid Hadi, Saiyid Mansur and many others.112 APPENDIX V. Report on Najaf Police. January Isi to December 31st, 1918. I personally took over charge of the Najaf City Police on June 15th, 1918. These men, I understand, came in drafts of 25 and 30 from Baghdad and Kut respectively, in January, 1918. All these men voluntereed to come to Najaf on the outbreak of the riots, and, although I was not in charge at the time, I have good reason to believe that they did splendid service. They suffered severe hardships, including the loss of all their personal property, and I am sorry to say that two of them lost their lives. The information given below was obtained from Qamr Beg, the present acting Bash Chaush, who was in charge during the riots and did splendid work. He came with the Kut draft, and all the Kut men were promised by Captain Wilson, the A.P.O. Kut, that they would be sent back again on the termination of one year’s service in Najaf. This promise was not kept, and several of the men complain, that, had they been sent back to Kut, they would invariably have obtained promotion and increased pay; but since the sanction to Col. Wilson to give them all the privileges of the Baghdad Pohce, no complaints have been received and they are more satisfied. On their arrival they were quartered in a building which is now the Civil Hospital, which they vacated for a more roomy and habitable place, of which I will speak later. Their first duty was to supply a guard on Thompson’s Tower of one N.C.O. and 19 men. After seven days trouble arose in the city amongst the population, threatening law and order. The chaush in charge (Qamr Beg) immediately reported same to the P.O., but owing to the shortage of police, sufficient precautions could not be taken to avert further trouble. Captain Balfour came from Kufah, and ordered police guards to be posted at Mishraq bastion, Main Gate and Buraq bastion, and also gave orders that no one was to be allowed to enter or leave the city. These duties were performed with good results until the arrival of British troops. One unfortunate and fatal incident occurred in the bazaar owing to the fact that a large mob of Arabs attacked the police then on duty, and the pohce, being outnumbered, reluctantly withdrew to the Serai at the orders of Captain Balfour] but unfortunately two of them were shot. The guard at Thompson’s Tower was also attacked and outnumbered, but, thanks to the kindness of Saiyid Mahdi, they were conducted safely to his house, where, without any casualties, they stayed until the British troops gained control of the city. At the orders of Captain Balfour all the police, with the exception of the 20 men that were befriended by Sayid Mahdi, went to Kufah and thence to Abu Sukhair. This sudden withdrawal and the fact that the city was in an uproar and looting was being carried on in an unscrupulous manner, the police lost all their personal property, including money, and w r ere left without any clothing but what they stood in, in spite of the repeated requests to Baghdad for a renewal of clothes. After several days the remaining 20 men, with the exception of eight (who were left behind to supply a guard on the main gate), were also sent to Abu Sukhair; here they remained for at least six weeks, and then were ordered to return to Najaf, where they took up quarters in the house of Haii Sa‘ad, and continued the guard on Thompson’s Tower, and patrolled the city day and night. These same duties were being carried on when I took over charge, and were continued for a month; but owing to the excessive nature of these duties, arrangements were made whereby the British troops took over the guard on Thompson’s Tower, and the patrols were reduced. All these duties had to be performed in addition to the daily parades, and although, as I say, the duties were excessive no complaints were received from any of the police. Owing to an abnormal shortage of water it was necessary to find a picket on Huwaish Gate to control the equal distribution of water to the various quarters of the city. A further picket had to be found at the entrance to the Temple, to assist the Inspector (‘Abdul Wahab Effendi) to arrest or disperse likely agitators of further trouble; and also one in the Borah Khan, to prevent Arabs from stealing wood, etc. In cause of all these duties, and owing to sickness, the daily parades had to be discontinued. Shortly afterwards the pohce were transferred to the Borah khan, the present barracks. When the Shabanah took over the quarters at Thompson’s Tower, and relieved the police guard at Huwaish gate and the entrance to the Temple, I was able to resume my daily parades. At the time when all the guards before mentioned had to be found, I was asked if some police could be spared to heln in the distribution of Government barley, which was put on sale in the city at a much cheaper rate than private barley. This caused numerous people to congregate at the various shops in the main bazaar at which the barley was being sold, thereby causing great trouble and also blocking the traffic each way. These crowds at times were at least 2,000 strong, and great tact was needed and exercised under these trying conditions, which lasted quite a month, during which time the police did good work in controlling the people. This state of affairs continued until I was able to obtain a largt seef from a large gram merchant which enabled me to draw the crowds to another quarter, therebv keeping the mam thoroughfare clear. This still daily occupies the time of myself and eight police' P g Further praise is due to the police at the time when the water supply was practically stopped and, owmgtotheir coolheadedness and tact, the distribution of water was carried out splenLlv thus SrStlu™ dlStUrWeS ’ Which WOuld have undoubtedly been caused had they not taken over owing to certain difficulties, I had to iffi^nig^ mov^f’ron^thtThtm^^f’Haji^Sa^adl^Since^aking^over^these^prem^s in^ 1 Au'gu 8 t°I^av ^ 1 P°^P e ' g ° od qua r f “ I should at the same time like to propose that, if possible, some of the confiscaSw' to tamed totowljQ Kut 1 on the the men tion and Baghdad ich they • After 1 chaush f police, ie from on, and 58 were ncident n duty, Balfour, indness stayed t were drawal pulous othing :nd to £t six Haji Fhese but •oops d to i, no te to ad to ist or from to be When awaish hen all help in te than bazaar ic each i under work in from a ring the stopped, Uy, thus ken over me time, six men. he police uider the or myeelf )S t jnedint' 113 quarters for my married police. This would keep them together where, if in case of emergency, I could call upon them easily, whereas now they are scattered about, and in the event of my needing their services urgently, great trouble and loss of time would ensue in finding them. Strength. —My present strength of trained men is 45. I have 20 new recruits undergoing training. I have been asked to recruit up to 100, but the proposals of the A.P.O. to find several additional duties in Najaf, also several police for Kufah, would necessitate the addition of an extra 150 men and two B.O.R.s, thus bringing my establishment up to 4 B.O.R.s and 250 N.C.O.s and men. With these, the whole of Najaf and Kufah would be under police supervision, and I do not think I have overestimated the number required. General Behaviour. —During the latter part of July several complaints were received, both from the police and from civilians, that the conduct of one of my constables was far from being up to the standard expected. On investigation the complaints were proved to be justifiable, and the man in question was severely punished, imprisoned and discharged. Several complaints were also received regarding the behaviour of some of my police. These were duly dealt with, and I am pleased to report that up to the present time no complaints have been received, and the behavious of the men is all that can be desired. (Signed) W. F. Fear, Sergeant, I.C. City Police, Najaf. APPENDIX VI. Shamiyah Shabanah. Annual Report, 1st August, 1918, December 1st, 1918. Shamiyah Division Shabanah was originally started as a rough armed force about a year ago, without attempts being made either to drill or discipline the men. In the summer of this year (1918) it was decided by Mr. Wingate, Political Officer, Shamiyah, that the time had come when the force should be put on a properly organised footing, with a British officer in charge, responsible for training, discipline, and the proper carrying out of duties. Mr. Wingate’s proposals were sanctioned by the Civil Commissioner, and I was appointed Officer Commanding Shamiyah Shabanah in July, and took over charge of the force on 1st August. As is usual in many other divisions of the ‘Iraq, I found on taking over a strong prejudice against drill and discipline—so strong, indeed, that close on 50 of the Kufah Shabanah had taken their departure the previous day. I had an opportunity of seeing these men. and agreeing with A.P.O. Kufah that we were distinctly better without them ; with six exceptions, they were all of the decrepit and elderly type, which at one time was all too common in Shabanah. The men who agreed to remain on in the force and accept training and discipline, I was glad to find, were younger, and of much better physique than the 40 odd who took their diseharge; but even these commenced drill in a somewhat hesitating and uneasy frame of mind. Rumour and the malcontents had been busy in bazaar and coffee-shop and the story was going the round that the Shabanah were being trained for service against the Germans. I ridiculed such ideas, took care to make first parades very short, and tried to keep the work from getting monotonous, with the result that in a few days I discovered that I was awakening an interest, which steadily became an enthusiasm as the men noticed their own progress. I was fortunate in having a small detachment of Hillah Shabanah with me, all of whom were smart at arm drill; this awakened the spirit of emulation amongst the Kufah men, and ere many days had passed they were drilling as well, and in some cases better than the Hillah men. The system of training I adopted was exactly similar to that of the Hillah Shabanah : M.I. drill dismounted and special attention to the manual and the three firing positions. A man is considered to have “ passed in drill ” when he is capable of moving correctly in squad and of handling his arms with clean, precise movements. So far I have only dealt with Kufah headquarters ; in addition to my strength here, I had a large contingent of district Shabanah in various posts, scattered over a large and geographically difficult area. In P.O. Shamiyah’s original scheme it had been proposed that the district Shabanah should be much less trained, if at all, than those at Kufah headquarters. I now began to pay flying visits to the more accessible parts of the district, and endeavoured to awaken an interest in drill; these visits, I am glad to say, speedily bore fruit and were so encouraging as to decide Mr. Wingate and myself to adopt one universal training for the district. During August a further prejudice disappeared, viz., that against wearing uniform; we had so many tribal shabanah in Shamiyah that a belief had arisen that the division would revolt against wearing breeches and puttees; this proved to be entirely unfounded, and demands from our Shabanah for uniform became so constant that ere long we were sending panic wires to Baghdad for the early despatch of clothing for the whole division. So August passed, with the men getting contented and reassured, and recruits coming in in quite encouraging numbers.' Right through August we did foot parades morning and evening, and between parades I managed to visit all our nearest posts, as well as paying specia lattention to my detachment at Najaf. By this time it was plain that if our outlying posts were going to get the supervision they required, increased establishment of British officers and N.C.O.s was imperative. P.O. Shamiyah, therefore, called upon Headquarters to assist us with at least one additional British Officer and four B.O.R.s. ’ August finished with the force really a going concern; efficiency increasing, recruits coming m, and clothing and arms on indented. Our total recruited strength at end of this first month was some 370 of all ranks.114 Early September brought us uniform, which was received with enthusiasm by all ranks, and made a tremendous difference to the appearance and efficiency of the force. With the majority of our Shabanah the first attempt at carrying themselves like soldiers dates from putting on uniform. Our first 100 Peabody rifles, with ammunition, also arrived about this time, and were at once issued to our most efficient men. We were fortunate in getting a good proportion of our strength clothed and armed at this time, as I had been warned by P.O. Shamiyah that a strong force of smart Shabanah would be required in Najaf, during September, to cope with the crowds which were expected in the Holy City during the two Ids, and for the great September pilgrimage. With this in view I moved every available trained man from Kufah headquarters to Najaf on 17th September, bringing our strength up to 122 of all ranks, exclusive of the force of 47 smart Municipal Police, who are employed constantly on internal duty in the city. With the Shabanah we increased all our existing Gate Guard, made a strong post under an Arab officer close to the principal door of the Mosque, and started a system of patrols whereby the streets were never without two patrols, each consisting of a N.C.O. and four men. In spite of the fact that the crowds increased day by dav until it was estimated that there were not less than 60,000 pilgrims in the city, there were no disturbances of any description. This was particularly gratifying in view of the fact that this was the first pilgrimage since the outbreak of w r ar, and also that the pilgrims were almost entirely tribal Arabs, many of them representing tribes which are far from friendly with one another. The duties required from our Shabanah at this time were both heavy and trying to patience, but through it all the conduct of the men was exemplary, and when on patrol they bore themselves in a soldierlike and dignified manner. While in Najaf, Lieutenant S. H. V. White, of the 275th M.G.C., reported for duty with the force, and immediately and with characteristic energy took a grip of his duties; my thanks are due to Lieutenant White for the enthusiasm with which he has worked for the wellbeing and efficiency of the force; since his arrival discipline has hardened and smartness increased very noticeably. During September we started mounted parades for our sowari, and had to accept much less encouraging results than with our piada; this is principally due to the fact that many of our sowars are too old, and have passed the time of life when habits are changed and drill learned easily Never theless we have progressed, and our sowars can at least move quickly to a given point and come into action with some degree of smartness. What we require in our sowari is an influx of youncr recruits of the type we get m the piada; unfortunately lads of this age are seldom possessed of a horse or the means to purchase one. During September we received orders from Civil Commissioner that Najaf Municipal Police would in future, be considered as a part of the Shabanah force for purposes of organisation and discipline’ These police came originally from Baghdad and Kut, and have been acting as Municipal Police at Najaf since prior to the riots in the early part of this year. The police are specially trained for internal work in the City, dealing with crowds, grain distribution, checking extortion in the sale of water etc etc. Their military training is not so comprehensive as that of the rest of the Shabanah, but such movements of rifle and arm drill which they do are carried out with commendable smartness and precision The police are m charge of a very efficient British sergeant, Sergeant Fear l/4th Somersets who has been with them since the early summer and thoroughly understands the police routine of the town. Sergeant Fear has a corporal to assist him.

I left hospital in mid-month for the purpose of Sng a trip^tto Qusur U buj htda recurrence of the trouble and had to abandon the project, and the tour, extending to about a week, was done by Lieut. White. The Qusur, consisting of a line of desert outposts to the westward of Najaf, was formerly under the P.0. Desert, but had now been ordered by the Civil Commissioner to form part of Shamiyah area. Full information regarding the posts is given in Lieut. White’s road report At the reading of the Peace Proclamation the Shabanah paraded at'Najaf and Kufah along with the British Regiment, and created a good impression with their steadiness on parade. They were also on parade on the notable occasion when some 2,000 tribesmen and Saiyids from Shamiyah Division rode into Najaf to present their congratulations to P.O. Shamiyah on the occasion of the Peace with Turkey. At the end of November we had a total strength of all ranks over the Division of 526, including Municipal Police; this number did not include the Shabanah on the Qusur. The Duties and Posts which we had to find in this month ran away with over 350 of the above number, the balance available for parade, about 170 men, being divided round our three markaz—Kufah, Abu Sukhair and Umm al BaTur. We have a good deal of wastage through sickness, and in addition have got to allow about 6 to 7 per cent, of strength leave of absence to visit their homes each month. December has brought us all outstanding indents of clothing and equipment, and we are now probably the best clothed Shabanah Division in the country. The warm jerseys which we have been fortunate in getting right at the commencement of the cold weather have been much appreciated; the same applies to the sheepskin poshteens, which have been obtained locally, and which were most necessary to a Division such as ours with our heavy guard duties. As equipment we have received the M.S. bandolier, which is a great improvement on the variegated cartridges carriers which our men formerly had to provide at their own expense. The haversack provided is also excellent, the Indian followers’ pattern with an extraordinary carrying capacity. On 12th December we had the honour of being inspected by the Civil Commissioner, when we paraded some 90 strong, all of Kufah head quarters. The Civil Commissioner saw the men perform arm and company drill, and expressed himself as well satisfied with the progress, we had made. We finish the year some 520 strong, which will be increased to 580 when thp Qusur Shabanah are taken over. Our sanctioned establishment, with the Qusur included, is just short of 800, but at present rate of recruiting it will be a considerable time ere this number is reached. The heavy wave of recruiting which we had in October and November appears to have spent itself, and now the few recruits, who come in are only sufficient to balance the wastage we have through physical unfitness. Later on, when Departments’ demands for labour are lighter, we shall no doubt have quite an influx of good recruits; but at present many of the class from whom we would get recruits in the ordinary course are employed by I.W.T. Irrigation, Resources, etc., and making very excellent wages for not a very onerous day’s work. Shaikh ‘Alwan of the Bani Hasan has promised us 50 of his people for piada, also a number of sowars and a young man of shaikhly family as an officer; but, so far, these have not materialised. We have every reason to be satisfied with the progress made in these first four months, especially in Headquarters: the men are already of the standard in drill and efficiency of a useful militia. In Abu Sukhair also we have a very smart and contented detachment. Captain Lyell, A.P.O., Abu Sukhair, has been of the greatest assistance to us, both in his interest in the men’s welfare and in their discipline. At Umm al Ba’rur we have not advanced as rapidly, this markaz being our newest, and also being handicapped through having to find so many district posts, some 85 men being required for these duties constantly. Drill is, however, going on steadily, and the men being brought up to the “ Pass ” standard as quickly as we can get them in; this is, of necessity, slow, as we have insufficient numbers to relieve each post periodically. In my opinion, formed on what I have seen of the force both in Hillah Najaf and Shamiyah, the Shabanah is in every way encouraging : the men are quickwitted, learn drill easily, and are amenable to discipline. The ideal system for the running of a Division of Shabanah would be that at present in vogue in Hillah Shabanah, i.e., having a strength sufficient to allow of about one-half of the men being in Headquarters each month for a stiff and comprehensive course of training, while the other half are on posts. The two halves being changed over each month, this would ensure that every man does his six months of training each year. Each Division should have sufficient B.O.s and B.O.R.s to make 'constant inspection of posts possible, as well as having sufficient staff in Headquarters to make training efficient. A present weakness of the Shabanah is the Arab officer. With a few notable exceptions, we have not got the class of man one would wish to see as an officer, and, even having got him, the present system of teaching one’s officer his duties in front of the men he has afterwards got to command is undesirable. The remedy would be a central Training School for Arab officers, where the officer would go through the mill as a nafour, and afterwards get a thorough grounding in his duties as an officer. Before concluding this report I wish to place on record my sense of obligation to Mr. Wingate, Political Officer, Shamiyah, Najaf, who has at all times been sympathetic, indefatigable in his efforts to help us. Statistics regarding current expenditure and Budget for New Year follow. (Signed) Wm. McWhinnie, Lieut., A.P.O., Officer Commanding Shamiyah Shabanah.APPENDIX VII. Revenue Statement of the Division.

Hillah Division.— The Hillah Division came into existence during the course of the year, the administrative authority of the Political Officer, Hillah, being extended to embrace the districts of Diwaniyah, Musaiyib and Hindiyah, while in the month of June Karbala was also included. Boundaries.— The Division marches with Dulaim Division in the North and Kut and Shamiyah in the South, and at its broadest point stretches from the Tigris to the Shifathah oases, 40 miles West of Karbala. Area. —The whole of the Division has not yet been accurately surveyed, but the approximate area is 6,000 square miles. Toivns. —-The principal towns are Karbala (40,000), Hillah (25,000), Diwaniyah Dagharah, 'Afaj, Qahah, each about 8,000, Hindiyah, also known as Tuwairij, and Musaiyib, each about 5,000. Tribes. —The great bulk of the population is tribal, and owns allegiance to a feudal head. In the Hillah district, where most settled conditions have been established, are to be found embryo village communities—embryo because they have not yet quite broken loose from the tribal organisation. Position of Shaikh. —The policy followed has been to work as far as possible through the Shaikh—he is held responsible for the payment of Government Revenues, for the maintenance of law and order within his tribal borders and for generally assisting the Political Officers in the administration of their districts. The Shaikhs have not been slow to respond to this entire reversal of the policy of the Turk; they realise that, so long as they conduct themselves towards their tribes in a manner consonant with British ideas of justice, they can count on a measure of support which has vastly increased the dignity of their position. Tribal Position. —The twelve months that have passed has seen a vast change in the tribal position. When the year opened, it was but a few months since the Turkish garrison of Diwaniyah had surrendered, and the tribes of this district were thoroughly out of hand. On the North, the Turkish front line was still sufficiently close to render the task of smuggling from Musaiyib to the enemy one of no great difficulty—while the presence of Turkish spies and sympathisers was a source of constant pre-occupation to Political Officers. During the year the tribes have settled down to an acceptance of British rule and its accompanying “ Pax Britannica ” in a manner that can only be described as truly remarkable. Tribal Position in Dhvaniyah. —Especially is this the case in Diwaniyah, the tribes of which were a constant thorn in the side of the Turkish Government. Paying little or no revenue, they more than once caused Turkish forces despatched for its collection to beat a hasty retreat. The change which Capt. Daly has wrought in the nine months during which he has been in charge of the district may be judged by the fact that 10,000 tons of revenue grain has been paid in, while the tribes have themselves been persuaded to destroy the great majority of their towers. Movement of Population. —A considerable re-adjustment of population has been taking place during the year—in Hindiyah district the construction of the two new canals, the Bani Hasan and Jorjiyah has been followed by a great movement “ back to the land,” and the population has probably doubled in twelve months; the opening of the Yusufiyah Canal in Musaiyib has brought a great influx of fallahs on to land that has lain waste for generations, and in Diwaniyah the assurance of water supply has brought the A1 Budair tribes flocking back to their old homes. The Bedu. —The vicinity of the Western borders of the Division to the Great Arabian desert brings the tribes into contact with the Bedu, and the regulation of their mutual relations involves questions of some difficulty.120 The Bedu are beyond the limits of the occupied territory and the only effective method of exercising control over them is through the payment of subsidies and regulation of supplies of grain and other necessaries to them. The arrangements in connection with supply of barley and wheat during the past year for various reasons failed to provide the ‘Anizah with a sufficient quantity to meet their requirements by the time they arrived on the borders of the Hindiyah district, and the result was an outbreak of smuggling of grain, which was difficult to deal with, and which resulted in one or two encounters between the Karbala road Shabanah, and the Bedu and the creation of a good deal of ill-feeling between the latter and the Bani Hasan, to which tribe the Shabanah belonged. Next year there will not be the same difficulty in rationing the Bedu, but the question is one which requires timely consideration. A further problem is the settlement of outstanding claims between the Bedu and the settled tribes. A certain number are still outstanding and Mit‘ab Beg of the ‘Anizah, who has been representing them in this connection, has shown marked unwillingness to settle several outstanding clqims. Tribal Majlis .—The Hillah tribal majlis met but seldom during the year, but the Assistant Political Officers availed themselves largely of the advice of the Shaikhs which form it. The Assistant Political Officer, Hindiyah, has formed a district majlis, consisting of three tribesmen and one townsman of Hindiyah, who meet once a week and deal with such disputes as the Assistant Political Officer refers to them. It is hoped that this majlis will take a great deal of petty non-criminal case work off the hands of the Assistant Political Officer. It is quite impossible for the Assistant Political Officer to deal with more than the more important disputes which arise in the district, unless he is to be unduly confined to his office table, and it is greatly to be preferred that local men should settle local disputes wherever this is possible rather than refer them to a Baghdadi of the bad old official caste, and this is at present the alternative. The settlement of disputes of all kinds by a majlis on the lines of established tribal custom is familiar to the Arab, and if the majlis has behind it an authority watching and, if necessary, revising its decisions and enforcing them when approved, there is no reason why the results should not be good. The experiment is certainly one that should be tried wherever possible-—if our administration is to be a success we must have the active assistance and co-operation of the people of the district. At present the best indigenous talent outside the towns is unwilling to enrol itself in an administration the minor officials of which are mostly drawn from the class which they have been wont to look upon as the embodiment of all that is corrupt and inefficient. Siege of Najaf.—The siege of Najaf consequent on the murder of Captain Marshall was watched with close attention by the people of the Division, but, except in Diwaniyah, there is no reason to suppose that there was ever any real' chance of the sympathy which was undoubtedly felt for the holy place being translated into deeds. It was, perhaps, fortunate that the trouble occurred at a time when men’s thoughts were full of the large profits they expected to make from sale of their grain in the approaching harvest. The firm* handling of the situation had an admirable effect throughout the Division. While the tribes were anxious about the safety of the Holy Shrines, probably few of them had much sympathy for the people of Najaf in the troubles which they had brought on their own heads. The future of the Tribal System .—The policy followed since our occupation of the country has had the effect of solidifying and strengthening the tribal system and at present the tribe is the readiest medium to hand through which to carry on the administration of the district. It is almost certain, however, that the tribal system will not survive the establishment of law and order. Under the conditions which prevailed generally before our arrival in ‘Iraq, membership of a tribe was an essential to the individual; for it was only as member of a tribe and backed in the last resort by the arms of his clansmen, that the individual could hope not for security for life and property, for this was unattainable, but for such measure of support as would enable him, when wronged, to have some chance of redress With the establishment of t he “ Pax Britannica ” through tire length and breadth of Iraq, the tribe will cease to be a necessity to the individual—he will live in peace and security and reap the fruit of his toil, not because he is a Bani Hasan or an Albu Sultan, but because he is a civis Britannicus. Given a continuance of BritishGovernment in ‘Iraq this process of the disintegration of the tribal system cannot be long delayed; but meantime the tribe is as essential to the Government as it formerly was to the individual, and before the tribal system disappears it is to be hoped that the present Effendi class will have been replaced by officials selected from the best that both tribe and town has to give, and the “ best ” of the tribe should provide promising material. The Absentee Landlord. —One of the most difficult problems which demands a solution is the case of the absentee landlord, mallak, almost invariably a townsman, frequently a Baghdadi, who, by methods which in at least 50 per cent, of cases, were distinctly shady, has acquired a title to a large extent of fertile land—in many cases he has never set eyes on his property, in 99 cases out of 100 he has never received in full the mallak’s share of the produce, in some instances the tribesman has taken advantage of the weakening of Turkish authority during the war and has resumed possession of what he claims to be his by immemorial tribal custom. On the one hand stands the mallak, his papers are probably in order to the last seal, he protests that he has been robbed of his right by a set of wild tribesmen, who have not hesitated to commit the unforgivable sin of encroaching on the sacred rights of the Holy Saiyid. He stands upon his rights and demands his pound of flesh. On the other hand the tribesman is equally insistent if not equally vocal. In his view, the title to land which had been enjoyed by his forebears for generations lias been bartered for gold by corrupt officials of a corrupt Government —he admits the existence of the mallak’s title deeds, but he has strenuously denied their validity, and has never paid rent except when yielding to “force majeure ” : “ when an armed burglar comes to your house, the simplest plan often is to part with some of your property to induce him to depart.” The tribesman believes implicitly in the justice of his cause; he knows that the British Government is as just as it is powerful, and he cannot believe that it will consent to perpetuate a wrong done by the Turk. Such, in broad outline, is the problem as it exists throughout the Euphrates area, and there is not an Assistant Political Officer in the Division who has not given many hours of thought to the solution of the special cases of his owm district. No general policy has yet been laid down for the guidance of Political Officers in the decision of the cases of this nature which come before them, and this is not the place to discuss the solution of one of the most difficult problems which confronts us. Suffice it to say that a solution must be found, and speedily, for what in many cases is an open sore in the district administration. Summary. —To recapitulate—the most striking features of the year’s admini stration as it affects the tribes have been :— (1) The settling down of the tribes and the gradual establishment of law and order. (2) The strengthening of the position of the Shaikh and the solidifying of the tribal system. (3) A very considerable movement of the population through the return of tribesmen to their old land, deserted because of lack of water for irrigation. This was specially marked in Hindiyah district and to a lesser extent in Musaiyib and Diwaniyah. 2. Revenue : Conditions of Revenue Administration. —The condition of the Revenue Administration of the Division, as found by us, aptly epitomises Turkish methods. Assistant Political Officers on transfer to a neighbouring district find themselves confronted wdth an entirely different system of land tenure to that to which they have been accustomed; even the share demanded by Government on miri land varies in different districts. From miri land in Hillah district the Government claims 50-60 per cent, of the gross produce, in Diwaniyah 40 per cent, and in Hindiyah 33J x jer cent - Different Land Tenure. —Broadly speaking, all agricultural land, exclusive of Waqf, falls under one of three classes : (1) miri or Government land; (2) Sanniyah or former Crown land; (3) Tapu or private property. In Musaiyib a large part of the land is Sanniyah; in Karbala it is almost entirely Tapu; in Hindiyah and Diwaniyah, Miri predominates; in Hillah, Tapu. Revenue Collections. —The principal task which confronted Political Officers was the collection of the largest possible amount of barley and wheat revenue in122 order to 'meet the requirements of the army, from a people who had been accustomed to pay little or nothing to the predecessors of the British Government. The task was one of real difficulty; information as to tenures, tribal customs, &amp;c., was extremely meagre, the revenue staff was generally corrupt and inefficient, and in effect each Assistant Political Officer was left to work out his own salvation as best he could. Assessment. —The great difficulty was the assessment of the Government dues. It had been hoped to base this on measurements of crops made by the Irrigation Department, but only one Assistant Political Officer, Hindiyah, found himself able to accept the Irrigation figures. Hindiyah is a small and compact district and the Assistant Political Officer was able to devote most of his time to revenue questions and inspections, and with the hearty co-operation of the District Irrigation Officers and Assistant Irrigation Officers concerned, a beginning was made of the only possible system under which reliable results can be expected. It is 'to be hoped that in the coming season a further advance will be made, and that it will be possible to introduce fixed assessment based on measurements. This is the most urgent problem which awaits settlement; until fixed assessment based on measurement is introduced, it will be impossible to eliminate some form of crop estimation with all its attendant evils. Collections. —The Government Revenue from winter crops in the Hillah Division amounted to 21,107 tons barley and 6,442 tons wheat, and it is a matter for no small congratulation that it has been possible to collect this amount. Twelve months ago there were few Political Officers who did not contemplate the necessity for the use of military force to get in the revenue, and the manner in which the Arab has paid his dues is eloquent testimony to their acceptance of British rule. Needless to say, no attempt was made to collect the full pound of flesh. In Diwaniyah the Government demand was reduced from 40 per cent, to 25 per cent.; in Hindiyah, rates of yield per masharah were calculated so as to leave a margin of safety against the possibility of overassessment; in Hillah the estimation of the gross crop is known to have been light, and, in addition, handsome bonuses were paid to the Shaikhs for their efforts in getting in the revenue. For the present it will probably be advisable to continue the payment of a percentage to Shaikhs for their services in getting in the revenue. Summer Crops. —The assessment of summer crops was made in all districts on a combination of estimation, classification and measurement. No attempt was made to make use of figures of measurement by the Irrigation Department, as with ploughing, sowing and harvesting proceeding simultaneously, and six or eight different kinds of crop in the ground side by side, it would have been almost impossible with the available staff to obtain results which could have been acted upon. The collection of Government share on summer crops has been greatly simplified by the fact that it is paid in cash and not in kind. Charads. —Charads are numerous in.all parts of the Division save Hindiyah; the collection of revenue on charad lands was simplified by taking a fixed sum per bucket, and calls for no special remarks. Fruit and Vegetable Tax. —The fruit and vegetable tax has been the cause of considerable discontent. Two methods of collection were followed: in Diwaniyah and Musaiyib a fixed sum of Rs. 1/- per juwah or barrow was collected, while in the rest of the Division the tax was farmed. The two methods are equally objectionable— vegetable cultivation is continuous throughout the . year, and it is impossible efficiently to check the count of juwahs. The farmer, besides collecting one-fifth on all sales in recognised markets, had the right to one-fifth of the value of all vegetables consumed at home, a right which gave rise to a considerable amount of dissatisfaction. As the lesser evil and pending the inclusion of the vegetable tax in a consolidated land tax it would be better to collect the vegetable and 'fruit tax only in the market place, leaving home consumption free; it will be the wisest policy to reduce all vexatious imposts to a minimum, while concentrating attention on the really important source of revenue—winter and summer grains. Kodak. Kodah was collected in a variety of ways ; in one district through the Shaikhs, in another by the appointment of' special mamurs, and in yet anotherIby the ordinary Revenue staff. Like the vegetable tax, this is difficult to collect on any satisfactory system. Undoubtedly the least vexatious method is through the Shaikh, but with weak Shaikhs this means loss of revenue. At present at any rate the tax should be continued, as it is the only contribution paid to the Exchequer by a considerable portion of the inhabitants. Tobacco. —Tobacco is grown to a considerable extent in Hindiyah and Karbala. The method of collecting the Government share—one-fifth—is to estimate the crop and to collect the revenue when the tobacco is sold by the grower. Other taxes call for no special remark. Tapu. —During the year a Tapu Department was formed in Baghdad, but its activities had hardly extended to the Districts. Much work awaits it—the examination of tapu claims and documents; the sifting of the true from the false; the registration of the former, the rejection of the latter. Mallak and Sarkal. —The regulation of relations between Mallak and Sarkal is one of the more pressing problems which await settlement. It is clearly impossible that the Mallak should be allowed to exercise the right which he claims to remove and appoint Sarkals at his will. A beginning has been made by the issue of an order forbidding Mallaks to remove Sarkals without permission from the Assistant Political Officer, and, con sequent on this, it is necessary to fix a fair rent and insist on its payment. The whole question presents many complications, and will require special study before a general policy can be framed. Waqf. —Save in Hillah District, there is a very small amount of Waqf property, and such as there is has received but scant attention from already overburdened Political Officers. Noav that a Department of Auqaf has come into existence in Baghdad, it is to be hoped that Waqf lands will receive closer attention. Conclusion. —The country is bristling with-problems of Revenue administration; the great desideratum is definite information as to actual conditions and customs in different areas, and the immediate necessity is the collection of this information; until this has been done, it would be premature to attempt to frame any general policy. Festina lente must be our motto. The administration of the country has been for centuries in a state of chaos : better that each step in the reduction of chaos should be gradual, than that “ uniformity ” of system, so dear to the Englishman’s heart, should be introduced on insufficient information and in opposition to the ingrained customs of the land. 3. Irrigation. —The year that has passed has seen a great deal of solid work accomplished by the Irrigation Department. New Works. —The excavation of the two new canals of Hindiyah, the Jorjiyah and the Bani Hasan, was completed by January, just in time to let the people at the tail sow a late crop, and during the year much labour was expended in strengthen ing the banks; in Musaiyib a new head was constructed from the Mahmudiyah canal, the effect of which will be to bring under immediate cultivation some 15,000 acres of land which has lain waste for generations, while eventually it is hoped that a further 25,000 acres will be irrigated. Clearance of Old Canals. —Besides these new works, the capacity of old works was greatly increased by silt clearance, and many miles of protective flood banks were constructed, the result of which is seen in the reclamation from swamp of very large areas in Hindiyah and Karbala Districts. Question of Labour. —One of the main difficulties encountered by the Irrigation Department is the obtaining of labour at the time and place required. The Arab intensely dislikes regular labour and has a strong prejudice against working outside his own tribal land. It was found by bitter experience that it not enough to collect a hundred or a thousand Arabs in one spot if some immemorial custom was thereby infringed; the Shaikhs and Sarkals would obey the letter of the order and bring the men to the place required; the Arab would spend the greater part of the day slumbering peacefully in the nearest garden and in the evening return to his home. Faza‘. The most efficacious method of getting work done was undoubtedly by a “ faza‘, ” by which is meant a levee en masse of the tribe for a given period, generally not more that 5 to 10 days. Under these conditions the Arab works reasonably well, and however galling it may be to the engineer, who desires to see124 a known number of men turning out a known number of cubic metres for a given and calculated period, there is no doubt that, in many cases, the quickest way to get a given work finished is by one or more “ faza‘s.” Regulation of Water Supply. —The regulation of the water level of the Euphrates at the Barrage so as to meet the requirements of the varied districts, was a matter of some difficulty. The Hillah Branch has an open head and during the cultivation season the only means of regulating the water level in it was by raising or lowering the shutters in the Barrage. Thus it happened on several occasions that loss of crop was occasioned in Musaiyib and Hindiyah through the lowering of the river level to suit the requirements of the more important Hillah Branch. During the rice season also, when the water level was low, and every district needed a full supply simultaneously, it was impossible to meet all requirements, ft is most important that the distribution of the available water should be carefully worked out in the light of experience gained and timely intimation given to Political Officers so that cultivators may be duly warned of the area which they may cultivate. Distribution of Water. —A very important question is involved in the distribution of water from the larger canals. The irrigation engineer is naturally anxious to see every drop of water fulfil its function, and to prevent waste; this can only be attained by regulation of the supply not only in the larger canals, but in the smaller channels, until, in fact, the water reaches the crop which it is to irrigate. But this again demands a large number of subordinates, and subordinates of the only one type likely to be available for some time cannot be trusted not to take advantage of the golden opportunities which will present themselves. The subject is one on which differences of opinion exist, but I am very strongly of the opinion that it is sounder to leave the distribution from all, except the main, canals almost entirely to the Arabs themselves, even at a cost of a certain amount of waste to start with, rather than to entrust it to subordinates who will certainly involve our administration in a great deal of odium. More than one Assistant Political Officer has remarked on the vagaries of the underlings of the Irrigation Department ; to a large extent occurrences of this nature were inevitable in this the first year of our occupation, but it is of the first importance to guard against their recurrence. It is not out of place to quote one instance in order to show the dangers that have to be guarded against. One of the leading Shaikhs of the Division has land at the tail of a certain canal, higher up the same canal is a tapu property belonging to rich Jews. The Irrigation Official in charge of this section was also a Jew. Water was insufficient to save all the crops irrigated by the canal. The Shaikhs’ winter crops—an area of about 150 acres—almost entirely perished. The Assistant Political Officer took the matter up with the District Irrigation Officer, who personally interested himself in the case and made arrangements to ensure a sufficient supply of water to the Shaikh’s summer crops. These, however, also perished for lack of water. The Arab, who is a shrewd observer, attributes the result to the fact that, firstly, it is impossible for a British Officer to superintend personally all the activities of his subordinates, and that, secondly, blood is thicker than water. Relations of Political and Irrigation Officers. —The functions of the officer who brings the water to the land and of the officer who assesses and collects the Government revenues therefrom are so intimately related that it is impossible to say where one ends and the other begins, and the due regulation of their mutual relations is a matter of the greatest importance. During the past year, while in some districts nothing could have exceeded the cordiality of the relations between the two departments, in others there were unfortunate differences of opinion as to their mutual functions. Subordinates are quick to take their cue from their superiors in such matters, and such differences of opinion however honest on both sides, undoubtedly occasion a loss of efficiency 111 working of the administrative machinery. As has been remarked, in the present condition of the country, it is impossible clearly to mark the dividing line between the two departments, and the only arrangement which is likely to lead to smooth working of the administration is to recognise the Political Officer as administrative head of his division or district, and the Irrigation Officer as his technical adviser.Future Projects. An almost unlimited field for the extension of irrigation lies open; save in Hindiyah and Karbala, where the greater part of the land is already under command, large areas await water and fallahs. The supply of the latter is, however, limited, and it will be necessary to regulate the extension of canals according to the number of fallahs available.^ There is reason to believe that the existing surplus of population will be absorbed within a few years, and, until a considerable increase of population is assured, it will probably be wiser to rest content with the improvement of existing systems, rather than to embark on large and ambitious extensions. 4. Agriculture : Extension of Cultivation. —The past 12 months has seen a great impulse given to agriculture throughout the Hillah Division, as elsewhere, in the occupied territories. The principal factors leading to this result were the high prices of foodstuffs and the introduction of the reign of law and order, leading the cultivator to believe that he would be secure to reap where he had sowed. Additional factors were seed advances, which were given freely in Musaiyib and Hindiyah, and the completion of the Bani Hasan and Jorjiyah Canals. Except in Musaiyib, where large areas failed owing to the non-rise of the river, the agricultural position was generally favourable throughout the Division. Differences of Soil. —Actually the conditions varied greatly in different districts. In Hindiyah practically the whole district had lain fallow for three years, and the soil was as rich as Traq soil can be. In other places, especially in parts of Hillah and Diwaniyah, the soil is exhausted and needs a rest. Soil Exhausted. —Conditions under Turkish rule were so unsettled that the Arab, having no inducement to improve his methods, was solely concerned with getting the largest possible immediate return from the land. Rotation of crops appears to be practically unknown, the Arab’s substitute for it being to leave half his land fallow every year. Barley and Wheat. —The staple crops of the Division, as of other parts of ‘Iraq, are barley and wheat, the former predominating. The great desideratum at present is clean seed of good variety. The wheat as a rule is hopelessly mixed; the best makes indifferent bread and would not find a market outside Traq owing to the admixture of species. Indian Wheat. —Last year Indian wheat seed was distributed in Musaiyib, but owing to various reasons proved a failure. This year small quantities of specially selected Punjab wheat have been distributed to specially selected cultivators. There is no doubt but that the Arab will take to Indian wheat the moment he sees there is money to be made out of it, and our principal efforts should be directed to this end. Weeds. —One of the agricultural problems of the country is the eradication of weeds, which frequently choke the entire crop. It is to be feared that for some years, and until the population per cultivated mile is much denser than at present, the Arab will not find it worth his while to weed his crop. Agricultural Experiments. —The principal work of the Agricultural Department in this Division has been the establishment of a small experimental farm in the neighbourhood of Hillah. Indian wheat has been distributed in small quantities to selected cultivators. Seed potatoes have been imported; the bulk of those distributed last September rotted before they could be planted out, but it is hoped that seed imported for February planting will have better fortune. Up to the present the work of the Department has been preliminary, and little has been done towards bringing improved methods directly to the notice of the Arab cultivator. It is obvious that the best results can only be obtained by the closest co-operation between circle officer and Political Officers, and 1 believe that if the former were placed in the position of assistant and expert adviser to Political Officer Division, the efficiency of the work of the Department would be increased. In order to improve agriculture in the country, it is necessary that agricultural knowledge should be disseminated as widely as possible, and I believe that one of the most effective methods of attaining this end is through selected Shaikhs and Sarkals. In every district there will be found a few enterprising individuals who are quick to see the advantage of new methods, and eager to learn, and undoubtedly the most effective method of disseminating knowledge among them is through the Assistant Political Officer.126 Tobacco. —Tobacco is grown on a considerable scale in Hindiyah and Karbala districts. Only pipe tobacco is grown, the cultivators being ignorant of the art of producing cigarette tobacco. They are, however, keen to learn, and the intro duction of a few Persian cultivators with this object would be welcomed. Agricultural Machinery .—There is undoubtedly a great opening for agricultural machinery in this country, but there are many initial difficulties. To begin with, only light machines can be got about in irrigated country. A combined thresher and winnower would probably be acceptable to the Arab, who is at present entirely dependent on wind for his winnowing; but it would be almost impossible to take the machine off the road, and the first essential is, therefore, an area in which the land on both sides of such roads as exist is under barley or wheat. Secondly, it has to be remembered that the Arab will look with suspicion on any instrument which he imagines will give the Government any clue as to the amount of grain which his land has produced. With a threshing machine moving through the district and turning out a known number of tons daily, it would be possible to form a much more accurate estimate of the yield of the area than would be agreeable to the Arab. This does not apply to the Tapu owner, who, like Government, is interested in knowing the true 3 ueld of the land, and it is among this class that agricultural machinery of this type is most likely to find favour. A simple form of reaper, drawn by bullocks, such as is in use in the Punjab, is the type of machine which is most likely to find favour with the tribesman, and it is to be hoped that the coming year will see their introduction. Oil Pumps .—There is a considerable demand for oil pumps in parts of the Division, and the provision of cheap oil, which was arranged during the year, has been a great boon to pump owners. Arrangements have also been made for repair of pumps by a specially deputed . officer of E. &amp; M. Section. 1 A considerable demand exists for pumps, but they must be supplied at a reasonable figure; hitherto arrangements for their import do not appear to have materialised. 5. Municipal. The year has seen a marked advance in municipal administra tion. The chief features of municipal administration in Turkish times were chronic insolvency and a plethora of useless officials; the latter have been reduced within reasonable bounds, and every municipality is beginning to accumulate a credit balance from which works of public utility can be undertaken. Tlie m( J st urgent of these is the question of sanitation, and here Assistant Political Officers undoubtedly require guidance as to the best system to be adopted. I would welcome the appointment of a Sanitary Commissioner, whose duty it would be to \ isit all municipalities and advise Assistant Political Officers on such questions as drainage systems, provision of latrines and incinerators, the most effective method of preventing the spread of disease through the medium of the house-fly and kindred matters on wdnch Assistant Political Officers’ ideas are necessarily somewhat vague. 6 Judicial— The case work of the Assistant Political Officer falls under three mam heads criminal, civil and tribal, and cases are disposed of in a varietv of Cnmma/.—Criminal cases are tried solely by the Assistant Political Officer who, as a rule, is also the enquiring officer; the system has its advantages thou Mi it involves extra work on the Assistant Political Officer, and an investigating Inspector of Police, if an efficient one were obtainable, would be a boon. 1 The reports of Assistant Political Officers on this branch of the administration are not illuminating; but it would appear that the Division is free from grave crime except m Hillah, where the Assistant Political Officer reports that highway robberies were among the commonest form of crime. Murder was regrettably common, but this crime is generally dealt with under tribal custom and not as an offence against the State—only in Diwaniyah where an exceptional amount of lawlessness prevailed, was it found iiecessarv to inflict capita sentence for three particularly brutal murders. ,y capital Ctml cSttits.—Civil suits are disposed of in a variety of ways. In all districts are Shi ah ahms, official or unofficial, to whom a laree nronorHon „f -f referred either directly by the parties or transferred bv the Assistant Political Offi ^ Curiously, in Karbala, litigants appear to have less thethan elsewhere in the Pi vision, and frequently ask the Assistant Political Officer to decide the case himself, instead of referring it to an ‘alim. Tribal.- —Tribal cases are, as a rule, settled through the Shaikhs, in accordance with tribal custom, or fasts are arranged by a majlis appointed by the Assistant Political Officer. This method of settling disputes is undoubtedly the most satis factory to the parties concerned, who regard a settlement according to tribal custom as finally disposing of the matter. In 'October a Judicial Officer was appointed to Hillali, and it is to be hoped that the opening of a Civil Court here will relieve Assistant Political Officers of a certain amount of work. 7. Medical and Sanitation. —During the year dispensaries were opened at Hillah, Karbala, Musaiyib, Hindiyah and Diwaniyah. In Hillah a hospital for in-patients was opened in May, while in Karbala, Diwaniyah and Hindiyah a few in-patients are received. The dispensaries were everywhere welcomed by the Arabs, and undoubtedly have been instrumental in doing a great deal of good. Appendix C. of the Karbala report gives an interesting summary of the cases dealt with. Eye-diseases are everywhere common. There is undoubtedly urgent need for the extension of medical facilities. There appears little doubt that at least 50 per cent, of the children born never reach maturity, and unless the lives of the children can be preserved, it will be long years before the country receives the addition to its population which is so essential for its future development. There was a great lack of lymph for small-pox vaccination, as the supply was apparently barely sufficient for the needs of the Army. It is to be hoped that adequate supplies will be forthcoming during the approaching year. 8. Education. —It has not yet been possible to do much to foster the spread of education, the great desideratum being trained teachers and books. It is understood that a number of teachers are now undergoing training, and will be available before the end of 1919. The great difficulty is to obtain suitable persons. Men from the district so far have shown no alacrity to go to Baghdad in order to undergo training, and, after some experience of citizens of that city sent down to fill posts in various departments in the districts, the Assistant Political Officer is tempted to wonder, “ Can any good thing come out of Baghdad ? ” The problem of efficient Arab staff, of first-rate importance in every department, is of vital importance in the educational department. The need for the increase of educational facilities may be judged from the fact that a town of the size of Musaiyib has no school. An important question is involved in the provision of facilities for the education of the sons of Shaikhs and other leading persons of the district, who may not care to send their children to the ordinary town school. It is just this class—the younger sons of Shaikhs—that may provide a recruiting ground for executive officers of a more desirable type than is now available. 9. Police. Police, as distinct from Shabanah, exist only in Karbala and Hillah towns. The existing police force in Diwaniyah has been re-organised during the year as Shabanah. i x i The Karbala Police Force consists of 1 officer and 132 rank-and-file foot, and 1 office]’ and 25 rank-and-file mounted. They are under the supervision of a Sub- Inspector of Police, who is under the direct orders of Assistant Political Officer, ci&gt; I* fo £L 1 ct The men were sent for training under the Assistant Political Officer Commanding Hillah Shabanah. T , ... , The Hillah town Police Force consists of 1 Inspector and 22 rank-and-file, under the direct orders of Assistant Political Officer, Hillah. It would be more satisfactory if this force was amalgamated with the Shabanah. A small, isolated force of this description can never be efficient; there is little prospect of promotion for anyone, and its members cannot fail to stagnate. . . 1 . As regards the Karbala force, it is essential that it should remain under the direct orders of the Assistant Political Officer, and not be brought into the Hillah Shabanah as at present organised. It is impossible to imagine the Assistant Political Officer, Karbala, responsible for the policing of a town of the size of Karbala with a force over which he does not exercise even the power of reprimand, and this is the position of Assistant Political Officers’ districts with reference to their Shabanah. A possible solution would be to post a British Shabanah officer to Karbala as128 assistant to the Assistant Political Officer, and put him in charge of both town police and Najaf road Shabanah. Until, however, British officers are more plentiful than they are at present, this is impracticable. 10. Shabanah.— Earty in the year the task of reorganising the Shabanah force was taken in hand by Capt. Boyle, who was appointed Officer Commanding Shabanah, Hillah, Musaiyib and Hindiyah districts. .Diwaniyah Shabanah are at present under direct orders of the Assistant Political Officer, District, who is re-organising the force. It will have a strength of 1 officer and 170 other ranks. The sanctioned strength of the Hillah Shabanah is : mounted, 6 officers and 556 other ranks; foot, 8 officers and 392 other ranks. Actual strength on 31st December, 1918 : mounted, 5 officers and 477 other ranks; foot, 7 officers and 280 other ranks. Of the mounted men, however, between 40 and 50 have not yet provided themselves with horses. The work of the Officer Commanding Shabanah during the year has been to weed out the weak and inefficient, of whom there were a goodly proportion, and to instil into the Arab the rudiments of discipline, while at the same time making the condi tions of service sufficiently attractive to bring in the type of recruit required. The large measure of success which has been attained towards the accomplishment of these objects is due in no small measure to the personality of Capt. Boyle and the wholehearted manner in which he has thrown himself into a difficult task. After his first fears of being sent overseas had been overcome, the tribesmen came willingly enough from their native districts into Hillah to undergo training; and the sight of their brethren returning clad in a khaki uniform, in place of the rags and tatters in which they went, proved an incentive to recruiting. The way in which the Arab has taken to drill must have surprised even the most optimistic of his admirers. He has taken to it with the zest of an English schoolboy engaging in a new and fascinating game. How far he looks on it all as a game, of which he will tire when the novelty has worn off, it is at present impossible to say. * J Barracks. During the year there was no means of housing the Shabanah who came into Hillah for training, and they lived where they could find accommodation m the town. This most undesirable state of affairs has now been ended by the fitting up of roomy khan in Hillah as barracks, capable of accommodating 300 men. A special Sub-Assistant Surgeon has been appointed to attend to the Shabanah, and a dispensary is being fitted out, with accommodation for about 20 in-patients. The creature comforts of the men have been catered for by the appointment of an official coffee-man, who supplies coffee several times daily, the price being recouped bv cuttings from the month’s pay. ' 1 Much has thus been done to popularise the service and mitigate the boredom which barrack life must cause to the tribesman. hecruiknimL In the beginning of the year recruits were easily obtained in the towns, while the tribesman was distinctly shy of service. Subsequently, as reported by ( apt. Boyle in his report on Hillah Shabanah, Januarv-November 1918 the ilow of town recruits ceased and the tribesmen began to conie in freely. At present tlie position has again been reversed and, whereas townsmen are obtainable, a certain number of tribesmen have tendered their resignation, and a recent batch of tribal recruits only enlisted on condition that thev were not to be sent into Hillah to do their training. The fact that the cultivation season is in {nil swing probably has a good deal to £ present ^ SlUmp “ recrultin g&gt; an(1 these ups and downs are inevitable for Traininy.— The training which the Shabanah have so far received is such as to hnp^ion thlVe 'sHh' 7 h™’ ^ ^ ^ has been under'the 1 ession that the Shabanah may one day form the nucleus of an 4rab army I he result of this policy is that the Assistant Political Officer looks' with some suspidon on the Shabanah What the Assistant Political Officer requires is an efficient district police, and lie views with some concern the inculcation of the ” S Tf ~tV f the S0 H Wl A 80 0 '4° f »'*&lt;•* “ «** district Hiclan ine result ol this is that, considered as a district police force the Shabamh cannot be said to have been an unqualified success. If it' should be dedded t “the Shabanah to the point at which they can be considered an efficient militia force, it will be necessary to organise an efficient police force for ordinary district work, leaving the Shabanah for purely military duties. The question is of first-rate importance, and on its correct solution depends in a large measure the smooth running of the district administration. The work of the past year, in the case of Shabanah, no less than in practically every other branch of the administration, has been largely in the nature of an experiment, and at least it has been proved that the Arab is amenable to discipline and offers promising material for further development. 11. Labour. —The labour problem has been acute in Musaiyib and Hillah, especially in Hillah. The competition of various departments—Military, T.W.T., Resources, irrigation, railway—caused something like a labour famine, and rendered the task of apportioning the available labour one of difficulty. In other districts there was little demand for labour save for irrigation works, and this was generally arranged by the Assistant Political Officer through the local Shaikhs. Labour is likely to be at a premium for years. The construction of railways and digging of canals are likely in the immediate future to call for a large amount of labour, while the extension of agriculture which is proceeding will tend to absorb the surplus population and restrict still further available supplies of labour. 12. Miscellaneous : Railways. —During the year the broad gauge line from Baghdad to Hiilah, and the narrow gauge from Hillah to Kifl, were completed. They have rendered possible the transport of the Euphrates harvest to Baghdad; and, now that movements of troops on a large scale are no longer to be anticipated, it is hoped that both lines will soon be thrown open to goods and passenger traffic. Roads. —A large programme of road-making has been in progress during the year, and it is now possible to visit almost every part of the Division by car. Bridges. —During the year the Musaiyib bridge was broken and has not been repaired. In view of the pilgrim traffic from Baghdad to Karbala, the bulk of which passes through Musaiyib, a bridge there is badly required, and it is to be hoped that it will shortly be replaced. The construction of a boat bridge at Tuwairij has brought Karbala into direct communication with Hillah. From an Assistant Political Officer’s point of view, this is by no means an unmixed blessing, as it involves a considerable time spent in entertaining “ joy-riders ” which he can ill spare from more serious pursuits. A rest-house has recently been opened in Karbala which will supply a desideratum. Jails. —A central jail has been opened ' at Hillah, to which all long-term prisoners from Musaiyib, Karbala and Hindiyah are consigned. Diwaniyah has at present its own jail and, in view of the long distance to be travelled, it will probably be convenient to maintain this as a separate institution. Pilgrimages. —During the year an increasing number of pilgrims passed through on their way to visit Karbala and Najaf. For the first time for some years the roads were safe, and the change from Turkish times undoubtedly made a great impression on the pilgrims. Some difficulty is experienced in dealing with the pilgrim traffic passing through Musaiyib owing to the distance to the nearest railway station. It is always uncertain whether pilgrims starting from Musaiyib for Baghdad will obtain accom modation in the train and whether pilgrims from Baghdad on alighting will find donkeys to carry them to Musaiyib. The whole problem of pilgrim traffic requires careful organisation. Afforestation. —The question of afforestation has not yet received the attention which it merits. For the past two years ruthless felling of timber has been going on, and over considerable areas hardly a tree of any size, apart from dates, is to be found. The question of afforestation is one of great importance, since ‘Iraq must for many years be dependent on imported timber. It deserves expert study. Meantime a beginning might be made by encouraging the planting of poplars and willows along all perennial canals, the prohibition of felling without a permit, which has already been done in Hindiyah, the establishment of nurseries of some of the more common Indian trees such as babul, and the distribution of seed to selected Shaikhs.130 13. Establishment and Personnel : British Officers. —Major Macpherson was in charge of the Hillah Division from 1st January to 18th November, when he handed over to Capt. Tyler. Hillah. —Major Macpherson was also Political Officer for Hillah district till end of October, when he handed over charge to Capt. Dacres. The following officers have served as Assistant Political Officers, Hillah, for varying periods during the year: Capt. Livesey, Lieut. Creedy, Lieut. Platts, Lieut. Kerr, Capt. Aston, and (Japt. Hunt. The last two-named remained at the end of the year as Assistant to Assistant Political Officer, Hillah district. The following British Officers are at present with the Hillah Shabanah : Capt. Boyle, Officer Commanding, Capt. O’Connor, Lieuts. Hughes and Boyes. The following served during the year : Capt. McWhinnie, Capt. Chaning Pearce, Lieut. Berey, Lieut. Margrett. Diwaniyah. —Capt. Daly &lt; held charge from April till the close of the year. Capt. Webb joined him as assistant at the end of the year, taking the place of Capt. Chaning Pearce who had proceeded on leave. Hindiyah. —Capt. Tyler held charge until the beginning of December, when he was relieved by Capt. Thomson. Musaiyib. —Capt. Thomson held charge of Musaiyib until the beginning of December, when he was relieved by Capt. Livesey. Karbala.—Major Pulley, Captains Bray and Bovill held charge of Karbala during the year, the last-named remaining in charge at the close of 1918. It is, perhaps, invidious to make distinctions where all have worked willingly and well, but I camrot close without remarking on the able manner in which Capt. Daly has handled the most troublesome district in the Division. Establishment. The great lack at present is a competent clerical and executive establishment. The majority of the executive establishment consist of former Turkish officials, of whom all that can be said is that, as a rule, the efficient are hopelessly corrupt, and the honest—according to Turkish standards—hopelessly inefficient. Honourable exceptions there are, but they are few and far between. The clerical staff is mixed, Indians of every province and every class, Ano-lo- Indians, Baghdadis local Arabs, these form the hotch-potch of the office estabhsh- ments of the districts. The great majority of them have no training in systems of correspondence and office management, and Assistant Political Officers spend many heart-breaking hours searching through files for papers that should be, but are not. Many Assistant Political Officers themselves have had little experience of office management, and so confusion grows worse confounded. It should be possible to import a number of Indians thoroughly up in corre spondence systems who would instruct the local clerks in this all-important branch of their work. Special attention might also be paid to instruction on this subject to students at the Mamurs’ School in Baghdad. 14. Conclusion. —This Report has been written amid many interruptions and the press of other duties. It had to be completed by 15th January and the last instalment of district reports was received on 14th. It does not pretend to do more than touch lightly on the main features of the year s administration. The district reports are submitted as received. In most respects they are sufficiently illuminating to picture the conditions under which Assistant Political Officers have worked and show the progress which has been made. A Year's Progress.—It has, indeed, been an “ annus mirabilis ” in the annals of Jraq: motor roads have been driven through the length and breadth of the Division; the train rumbles dady past the ruins of Nebuchadnezzar’s Palace and Birs Nimrud; urged as by a wizard’s wand, “the waters have receded from the face of the earth, vast swamps have been reclaimed, and the wheat and barley now shows green where eight months ago the fisherman plied his net as he had done for generations For many miles of its length the Euphrates has been securely confined T WA I s ; fHd the waters, which yearly spread in devastating floods now at the bidding of the English engineer, carry life to rich lands that have lain deld or centuries. The pilgrim and the wayfarer pass securely and unarmed where formerly none but the strong man armed went, save in fear and trembling- 2nd itthe Arab has not yet commenced to beat his sword into a ploughshare, at least his rifle and his dagger are rusting from disuse. The achievements of the year, amazing as they must seem to the Arab, are hardly less a matter of marvel to those officers of the Civil Administration whose lot has been driving a laborious furrow within the constraining limits of India bureau cratic Government. To dig a canal without estimates, sometimes, in a whisper be it spoken, almost without sanction; to give an order and know that it will not be appealed against; to see the fruits of one’s toil appearing even when the task is but half done, and to receive almost daily expressions of the heartfelt gratitude, both of the humble toiler and of the potent Shaikh, for one’s own small share in the regeneration of this, the cradle of the human race, this is no small marvel to “the sun-dried Indian bureaucrat,” hardened by long use to the carping criticism of those whom he tries to serve. He must be dull, indeed, who does not sec in the year’s work a great inspiration for the future tasks that lie before us. H. H. E. M. Tyler, Captain, Political Officer, Hillah Division.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT, 1918. Preliminary. —From January 1st till the middle of November the district was in charge of Major Macpherson, who combined the duties of P.O., Division, and A.P.O., District. In the middle of November these offices were separated, and the office of A.P.O., Town, was absorbed in that of the A.P.O., Hillah. At the same time, Captain Livesey, A.P.O. Town, was transferred to Musaiyib, and Captain Aston was appointed as Assistant to the A.P.O., Captain Hunt joining the district staff on December 28th. I assumed charge of the district in the middle of November, having worked as Assistant to Major Macpherson since February. The Hillah Division was formed and its districts were separated during the year under review. The Administration Report for 1917 dealt with the Hillah Division as well as the Hillah district ; the following remarks refer to the latter only, and hence certain matters touched on in last year’s Report do not re-appear. 1. Tribal and Political: (1) General Characteristics of the District. —The Hillah district consists of the lands on either bank of the Shatt-al-Hillah from a point just above the barrage to a point just above the take-off of the Shatt Dagharah. The eastern boundary line runs midway between the Tigris and the Euphrates, the western is approximately midway between the Shatt-al-Hillah and the Shatt-al- Hindiyah. The land near the river is on the whole well cultivated, though much extension of irrigation is possible, but the Jazirah land at a distance from the stream is a grazing ground frequented in season by nomad tribes. The staple crops are wheat and barley, while rice is grown principally in Jarbudyah and Khawas. There are seven Shu‘bahs. In one of these there is a Mudir with three assistant mamurs, in another there is a ma‘mur with two assistants, while in each of the remaining five there is one ma‘mur with one assistant. The number of ma‘murs is excessive, but it will probably be possible to effect reductions as routine is introduced and the people grow habituated to the payment of revenue. (2) Villages. —The only town of any size is Hillah, with a population of about 24,000, but a feature of the district is the villages along the banks of the river. A trip in a hydro-glisseur through continuous lines of an enthusiastically cheering populace is the nearest approach that life can offer to participation in a royal procession. The villages are in all stages of evolution. Some of them are still practically tribal, while others have progressed further towards independence of the surrounding tribe, a development which the policy of supporting the Shaikhs has to some extent arrested. Some are walled against the tribesmen, others are open; some villages willingly refer their quarrels to the local Shaikh, others protest their freedom from tribal authority. All are surrounded by groves, which are as prolific of disputes as of dates. There is at present no organised local administration in the villages, and the mukhtars are becoming somewhat uneasy. I hope shortly to set this matter on a proper footing. (3) History .—The past history of the district has been dealt with in last year’s Report. (4) Tribal .—There are six principal tribes. (i) On the right bank of the Shatt-al-Hillah :— Yasar - - - - _ Shaikh Rashid al ‘Anaizan. Khafajah - - - - - „ Ibrahim Samawi. Jubur - - - - _ Murad al Khalil. (ii) Oil the left bank of the Shatt-al-Hillah :— Juhaish - MiTamrah Albu Sultan - Shaikh Faisal al Mughir. ,, Hazza‘ al Muhaimid. ,, ‘Addai al Jaryan. Ihesc Shaikhs constitute the district tribal majlis, and receive each a errant of Rs. 300/- per mensem. Shaikh Murad and Shaikh Ibrahim were appointed to the majhs during the year. There are also in the North-West the Bani ‘Ajil under Shaikh TTrnran al Zambur, who are treated as separate unit, and various small tribes, such as the Albu ‘Alwan and Dulaim, which have been placed under thecontrol of one or other of the permanent Shaikhs. This course, though administrat ively necessary, was unpopular with the small tribes. They are settling down now however, and are beginning to realise that an influential Shaikh is of considerable assistance. I have endeavoured to gild the pill by pointing out that certain favours are due to the representations of their Shaikh. The Shammar under Shaikh Faisal al Mutlaq, and the A1 Bu‘aij under Shaikh Mmish al Aziz,^ visit the district at certain seasons. The Shammar lead their flocks and herds^ into the Jazirah about November, returning northwards in March, while the Al Bu aij in early summer bring their camels for transport of the harvest. A certain number of them remain in Mahawil Shu‘bah throughout the year. In 1918 an allowance of Rs. 300/— per mensem was paid to Shaikh Nimish during his sojourn. All the tribes are Shi‘ahs, but Shaikh Hazza‘, of the Mu‘amrah, is a Sunni. During the past year the tribes have almost attained the happy state of leaving no history, and the tribal situation has entirely changed. My predecessor in his administrative report, had occasion to deplore the unwillingness of the tribes to submit themselves to the authority of the Shaikhs, and the reluctance of the Shaikhs to undertake responsibility for the behaviour of their tribes. Inter-tribal fights and highway robberies were frequent in the early days of the occupation, and order was little more than a name. The change was foreshadowed even in last year’s report. Largely owing to my predecessor’s handling of the situation all Shaikhs in theory, and all but one in practice, accept and adequately discharge responsibility for the behaviour of their tribes, and the tribesmen are on the whole well under the control of their Shaikhs. In March there was a fight about land between the Bani Mansur section of the Jubur and the villagers of Sharufah, and in April a smouldering feud between certain villagers and tribesmen near Khaiqan, in the Albu Sultan country broke into flame and fighting ensued. Both disputes were satisfactorily settled, and tow'ers were demolished with the help of the Shabanah, and since then, with one insignificant exception, there have been no tribal fights. Shaikh ‘Addai of the Albu Sultan was largely instrumental in securing a settlement of the dispute in his area. The tribal majlis has seldom met, but I have on. several occasions availed myself of the advice of individual Shaikhs. In the early summer there was an outbreak of thefts from the Military. The Mu‘amrah were the tribes responsible, but there is no doubt that they engaged the enthusiastic co-operation of the men of labour corps encamped in the vicinity. Fines were imposed on the Mu‘amrah, whose responsiility was admitted by Shaikh Hazza 4 , some of the labour corps were imprisoned, and there was no recurrence. In April, my predecessor was glad to seize an opportunity of knocking down towers, but new towers are turning to houses and stores, and the need of demolition has passed. Highway robberies have occurred, but infrequently, and there have been some murders, but the number has never approached indecency. I am well aware that a fairly large proportion of the offences committed are dealt with by the Shaikhs, and never come to my ears, but this is no cause for regret, and the quietness of the tribes is none the less remarkable. Census operations which were impossible in Turkish times have been accepted with equanimity, and the Shaikhs are readily co-operating in the enumeration of their tribes. To-day a single officer is welcomed in areas such as the Jubur and Albu Sultan countries where no Turkish official dared show his face without a strong military escort. In accordance with the policy of the administration, the management of the district has been carried on as far as possible through the Shaikhs; to them disputes of all sorts are referred, and they are held responsible for the behaviour of their tribes. The A.P.O. remains in the background, to prevent flagrant injustice, to ensure that adequate punishment is meted out to certain classes of offenders, and to back up the authority of the Shaikh in his dealings with his tribe. The policy has been amply vindicated. The Shaikhs are realising their responsibilities, and the tribes appear to accept the Shaikh’s authority cheerfully; while complaints against the Shaikh’s justice, even from other tribes or from townsmen, are extra ordinarily rare. It is true that there is always a risk that a Shaikh may develop erroneous ideas of his own importance and indispensability, and show himself oppressive to his people and contumacious towards the Government; but there are no indications of this at present, and, by keeping in close touch with the people generally and exercising a light but efficient control over the Shaikh, it should not be difficult to prevent abuses. x 10 1162—1 K134 The method indicated is, I think, the only one possible if the tribal system is to be upheld. No other system of government is at present practicable, but I fear that its days are numbered. The spread of education, the quickness of the Arab to seize a chance of bettering his condition, the extension of irrigation, the intro duction of new crops and improved methods of agriculture, and the obvious pecuniary advantages to be derived from a settled life, are factors which cannot but ultimately result in the disintegration of the tribal system. At the same time, government through the Shaikhs is the only alternative to government by native officials and to tyranny tempered by assassination. There are at present only two classes from which native officials can be drawn—the former Turkish officials, the outward and visible sign of the old regime, and the semi-educated young townsman, of whom the less said the better. Ultimately, no doubt the bureaucracy will come; but its day is not yet, and there seems to be no reason why its arrival should be hastened. Meanwhile, the longer the tribal system can be preserved, the better; and when at last it fails from natural causes, it is to be hoped that officials of sound training and good family will suceed it, and that no low-born Baghdadi will be permitted to dance prematurely and indecently on its grave. 2. Revenue : (A) Land Revenue : (1) General. — So far as can be judged from a diligent perusal of political diaries, the Hillah district from a revenue point of view is one of the most interesting in ‘Iraq. The amount of revenue is large, and the district exhibits practically all kinds of right in land. Besides large miri and mudawarwah areas, there are probably more tapu estates in Hillah than in any other district, while I have come across one or two claims to land as “ Sirf Mulk.” ‘Uqr rights are unfortunately endemic. There is a very large number of gardens affording illustrations of the system of mugharisji tenure. Tapu rights are found in every stage of development. The district can show examples of the Mallak who has paid some attention to his estates, as of him who till the British occupation had never so much as set eyes on his property. (2) Assessment .—I have dealt very fully with the winter harvest of 1918 in a special report. Owing to the inability of the Irrigation Department to complete their measurements in time, and to the inaccuracy of the measurements when completed, it became necessary to appoint committees to assess the revenue by means of “ dharah.” There is nothing to recommend this method except that it is familiar to the people, but this is a point of considerable importance. I am strongly opposed to utilising irrigation measurements unless these are very closely supervised by a British officer. They are probably no more reliable than “ dharah,” and they emanate from subordinates who have attained a remarkable degree of unpopularity. The Department of Local Resources was unable to effect any purchases of grain in the district, and the whole of this work devolved on the Political Department. Demands were issued on Sarkals and Mallaks, and the grain was collected by the revenue staff. It was obvious long before the harvest began that this was the only possible method of getting the grain required by the Army, and the present state of affairs as regards tibn illustrates what would have been the result had the purchase of grain been left to Resources. Out of some 11,000 tons of tibn available in the district, Resources, who undertook the collection after their path had been smoothed by my predecessor, have so far collected only 2,500 tons, a large part of which has been destroyed by rain for lack of precaution for its protection. The demand and collection to date are shown in Appendix A; but since Sarkals are allowed to sub stitute revenue barley for wheat at two tons for one, and purchased barlev for wheat at one ton for one, the figures are not accurate, and it is at present impossible to disentangle the revenue payments from the purchased grain. A large proportion of the land in the district is tapu and, as soon as shitwi assessments were complete, the question arose on whom demands for revenue should issue. It was decided that demands should be made on both Mallaks and Sarkals, and many were the wails and laments from the Mallaks. Demands had never been made on them before, and they loudly protested their inability to accept even ioint responsibility. VV hen the time of Sflifi harvest came, demands were issued on Sarkals, and the Mallaks performed a volte-face and protested indignantly. This attitude was due partly to the low conversion rates fixed, but also to the desire of Mallaks to assert their position. I regret that in some cases the Mallaks got the revenue shaio out of the Sarkals, whereout sucked they no small advantage* but some at least were compelled to disgorge. The whole incident is instructive as showing the position of the Mallaks in Turkish times and the change brought aboutby the British occupation. I consider that, in 1919, demands should issue in the name of Sarkals only. Joint responsibility is never expedient and, moreover, to issue demands on Mallaks would perpetuate an undesirable precedent and possibly hamper the future revenue policy. To collect from Sarkals commits the Government to nothing. (3) Rights in Land. -Undoubtedly one of the most pressing revenue problems in the district is the distribution of the different shares of the crop. The so-called legitimate demand which leaves only 40 per cent, of the gross yield to the fallah, plus a small rebate to the Sarkal, is obviously inequitable. In order to secure as much grain as possible for the Army, the full demand of 60 per cent, was this year made on Miri Muqata^alis, but a cash rebate was granted which reduced the demand to an amount varying from 36 per cent, to 50 per cent. Even if in 1919 revenue is to be collected in cash, it will not be possible to fix it permanently till prices settle, nor can the shares be finally determined, even on State lands, until a thorough enquiry has produced more information as to agricultural conditions than is now available; but some general arrangement must be made for next harvest. There are no complaints about Mudawwarah proportion of 36 per cent., and, pending a settlement, I consider it advisable to assess State lands at that rate. On tapu lands the question is more difficult. The specimen lease quoted in last year’s report of the Revenue Board was provided by Mr. Daniel, and the terms are those usually granted in this district by other Mallaks as well as by the Manahim family. Its conditions are obviously extortionate; but in Turkish times, as might be expected, they were not enforced. The Mallak bound his Sarkal by every possible means, hoping that at the harvest he might realise at least some of his demands. The Sarkal cheerfully signed any lease, whatever the terms, being firmly resolved to pay not an ounce more than he could help and knowing.that it was not likely that any great compulsion would be employed by the Government. The lease, in fact, meant practically nothing; what counted was the strength of each party when the crops were cut. The means employed by the Mallak to realise an income from his lands were manifold. In rare cases he collected in person; more often he employed a local manias wakil, purchased official support, gave the local Shaikh an interest in his share, or farmed his rights for anything he could get. What is abundantly clear is that, with very few exceptions, he never gathered his full due whether according to the 40 per cent, share rule or according to the lease. It is essential that a decision should be given as to what proportion the Mallak is to recover. In Turkish times the severity of the terms was neutralised by the impossibility of enforcement. In 1918 Mallaks and Sarkals were, to some extent, compelled to compromise. But though, in the absence of instructions from the Revenue Board, the adoption of any other course would have been difficult, the results were unfortunate. Practically no petitions for assistance in recovering the Mallak’s share were presented, and I fear that this can only mean that the Mallak collected his grain by the illegitimate help of subordinate officials from cultivators who, were they not cowed by fear of British Government, would have resented such action by cutting the throats of Mallak and Mamur alike. It would be possible to decide such cases in each district as they arose, but differences of practice between districts are undesirable, and I consider that a general policy for the whole country is most necessary. It would not be advisable to lay down any hard-and-fast rule prescribing the Mallaki share, because circumstances vary so much in each case; but I would very strongly urge the immediate initiation of enquiries with a view to the enunciation of certain general principles in order both to harmonise the action of individual A.P.O.s and to prevent the constitution of undesirable precedents. Political Officers will be confronted with this problem in the near future, and at present they are not equipped to deal with it. It is not possible adequately to treat the question in a report of this nature, but I have discussed it fully in a confidential memorandum to the P.O., Hillah, dated 22nd October 1918. Closely allied to the problem of Mallak’s shares is the question of ‘uqr. The position is much the same in both cases. On the one hand, there is a more or less legal right, and on the other the actual practice of many years’ standing. During the past year several claims to ‘uqr have been made before me. It would have been unw r orthy to ignore them, and it was in fact impossible to do so, because the Revenue Board had recognised the right by directing that ‘uqr deeds were to be registered and that ‘uqr was payable on the crop after deduction of revenue. All these cases were decided on the principle of possession, f.e., the ‘uqr holder was allowed what he had enjoyed in Turkish times, plus a percentage on account of the general riseof prosperity due to the British occupation. An c uqr holder has seldom any con nection with the land, and in former days used generally to farm out his rights, so that his previous income is usually determinable with fair accuracy. Claims to ‘uqr will certainly not decrease and, as in the case of Mallak’s rights, the enunciation of definite principle is imperative. I have invited the attention of the P.O., Hillah, to this matter also in a confidential note dated 22nd October 1918, and the P.O., Hillah, has addressed the Revenue Board on both the question of ‘uqr and that of the relation of Mallak and Sarkal; but, as I understand, without result. I suggest that we adopt as a basis the principle that no person or class should, as a result of the British occupation, derive an excessive profit at the expense of any other person or class. In the summer a notice was issued forbidding Mallaks to eject Sarkals, or Sarkals to leave their holdings without the permission of the A.P.O. This order was passed partly to secure to each party his rights and partly to prevent the commingling of different tribes, since under the system of tribal responsibility it is clearly undesirable that members of one tribe should migrate to the country of another. Disputes were few but acrimonious, and most of the complaints came from the Bait Manahim. No Sarkal was ejected if he had paid Mallak his dues; but the Mallak was promised that the Sarkal’s holding would be inspected during the next harvest and, if the cultivation was not properly carried out, the Sarkal would be ejected. (4) Collections .—All Shaikhs have guaranteed their tribes, and most of them have been active in pressing on collections. The figures are given in Appendix A., and I consider them to be on the whole satisfactor}^. Bonuses, consisting of a percentage of the collections, have been promised to Shaikh Hazza‘ and Shaikh Murad, and I propose to grant similar rewards to the other Shaikhs also. There are still some outstandings from 1917 which have been converted to cash at high rates, and it will probably be necessary to remit or reduce some of these. ^ I consider that greater use should be made of the Shaikhs in collecting revenue. Next season’s revenue will, I understand, be collected in cash, and I propose to transfer the enforcement of demands from the Mamur to the Shaikh. The revenue will be paid at the shu‘bah as at present, but all pressure against defaulters will be exercised by the Shaikh, who will himself have to pay outstandings. I hope that by this means the revenue will be collected more promptly than at present, the Mamur’s duties will be considerably lightened, and it will be possible to realise demands without sending gangs of qolchis to prey on every defaulting Sarkal, a method which is naturally unpopular and open to manifold abuses. I will submit shortly detailed proposals for the assessment and collection of the land revenue for 1919. (B) Tapu. Registration was under the A.P.O., Town, and has now been transferred to the Judicial Officer who will doubtless report thereon. Mahlul and Sequestrated Estates.—There are 16 estates in the district in which Government holds a Mahlul share. In 11 of them the other sharer is the Bait Manahim, who manage the Government share, submitting accounts monthly. The Fanharah estate is managed in the same way by Hamdi Bey, but from all the other Muqata ahs Government collects its share direct on the revenue assessment. Neither method is satisfactory; there is no proper check on the landowner’s management and the revenue assessment is unreliable. Of the two evils I would chose direct collection, since by landholder’s management the mahlul share is not known till long after the harvest, and the time and trouble spent in checking more or less unintelligible accounts would be better expended otherwise. An alternative and I think a better method would be to lease the mahlul share either to co-sharer or to fearkals for a fixed amount; but the ultimate solution of the difficulty will probablv be found m partition. . J ^ There are two sequestrated estates—those of ‘Ajil and Tzzat Bev The former is not very extensive The sequestrated share of the one muqata‘ah and the three baqkrahs were collected direct^ that of the three gardens was farmed out. ‘Izzat y has shares m eight muqata ahs, all of which were managed by the agents of his brother-m-iaw Hamdi Bey. Accounts were not submitted till the end of November Zgres^^ The P rocess of unr avelment is the Ckal? Jd it till tll \ se ^ ue ® tra f ted ^are of the muqata‘ahs has been leased to mantel 1 ’ d U probab1 ^ be found Usable to treat the others in the sameWaqf. T regret that it has not been possible till recently to exercise proper supervision over waqf affairs in Hillah, and no attempt could be made to look into the matter until the end of 1918. As in the case of other records, all waqf papers were removed by the Turks, the mamur waqf died last August, and officers’ hands have been full of more pressing work. It is not surprising, therefore, that auqaf affairs were found to be in a state of confusion. A visit from Jamil Effendi Inspector of Auqaf did something to set things straight, and a list of waqf properties was made out at the end of the year. I have reason to believe, however, that the title of the auqaf department will be disputed in several cases, and the auqaf proportion of the produce still more. In these circumstances it is impossible to give a clear and coherent report. Auqaf affairs are now being taken up, however; a survey of the properties is being made, and a proper system of accounts instituted and I trust that before long matters will be established on a proper footing. The work has not been facilitated by much assistance from the Auqaf Depart ment of Baghdad. A request for information on the subject was met by reference to the 1917 Revenue Administration report, which apparently was thought to contain all the information that could be desired. A note from 'an expert^on the waqf system generally, giving some account of its history and of the present situation and methods of management, explaining the different kinds of waqf and the distribution of produce, and stating what kinds of properties were liable to pay revenue, would have been of considerable assistance. Most of the Waqf property in Hillah is madhbut. The mulhaqah properties are dedicated to Jama‘ Khidr Bey at Baghdad and are in a bad state. There are four Sunni Mosques, of which only one, the Jama 4 Kabir, is endowed, the upkeep of the others falling on the Baladiyah, an iniquitous arrangement inherited from the Turks, which, I understand, it is necessary for the present to maintain. Mashhad al Shams is a Shi‘ah Waqf endowed with two shops. It has been neffiected in the past and needs repair. There are various properties dedicated to° other pious objects: the Jama 4 al Kabir and Mashhad al Shams at Hillah, the Haidariyah shrine at Najaf and Jama 4 Muradiyah, Jama 4 Bushnaq Ahmad Pasha, Imam al ‘Adham, Jama ‘Khidhr Beg, Jama 4 Munawwarah Khatun and Jama 4 Hannan at Baghdad. Of these only the properties attached to Jama 4 Khidr Beg are mulhaqah, but the management is temporarily vested in the Auqaf Department, as the Mutawalli is a minor. Practically all the Auqaf income from land for 1918 was farmed. The farm of the Mahawil 4 Uqr was cancelled, because collection in. full would have been contrary to the general revenue policy as regards uqr. Only the Jarbu 4 iyah and Madhatiyah properties and four gardens in Barmanah were not auctioned. There were no satisfactory offers for the former, the existence of the latter had not been discovered at the time the farms were given. Waqf dues from all these three properties will now be collected direct. There are still some outstandings from 1917. As no proper means were taken to recover these, and for political reasons it has been necessary to grant certain reductions. Full recovery is out of the question. The income from shops and similar properties is collected direct. Certain repairs have been carried out during the year, but further repair is necessary. Even at the present cost of labour and material, the expenditure will be remunerative. There are only two pious objects in Hillah the upkeep of which falls on the auqaf department. The Mashhad al Shams has a poor endowment, the income from which needs careful management; the Jama 4 al Kabir has numerous properties attached and its financial position is satisfactory. A statement showing the waqf demands and collections for 1918 is given as Appendix A. 1. Appendix A. 2 shows the receipts and expenditure on each pious object, excluding maqamat. Appendix A. 3 shows the demands, collections, and outstandings for 1917. I fear these figures are not wholly accurate, but it has been necessary to compile them hastily from badly kept accounts, and in the case of direct collections the demand could only be estimated. Despite the difficulties mentioned the auqaf income shows a satisfactory increase. Orders were received from the Director of Auqaf that no expenditure might be incurred without previous sanction. These orders were subsequently modified and permission was granted to spend up to Rs. 200/- in case of urgent need, provided the expenditure was immediately reported for sanction in C.D.Os. This procedure is unworkable. Apparently the intention is to centralise the control of all Waqf funds in Baghdad, a method which has resulted and must inevitably result in unnecessary correspondence, delay and inconvenience to all concerned. As things &amp; IO 1162—1 K 3138 stand, except in an emergency, an A.P.O. cannot spend five rupees on necessary repairs or improvements without previous sanction and the issue of a C.D.O. I trust that this state of things will be remedied. I fear the proposal to remove auqaf from the control of the Revenue Secretary and to place it under that of the Judicial Secretary will lead to difficulties. Tn this district by far the greater part of the Waqf income is derived, from land. There are no fewer than 91 gardens in which Auqaf holds a share, and 67 maqamat, besides shares in various estates and a valuable ‘uqr right. The administration of these is closely allied to the revenue administration, and they offer the same problems as confront the revenue authorities. For example, it is frequently necessary to decide whether a more or less legal right, whether held by a mallak or the auqaf, is to be enforced against cultivators who have never had to respect it in the past, and it would, I consider, be inadvisable that different principles should be applied by the two departments. I presume it is not intended that the local administration of Waqf property should be vested in judicial officers, who are not in a position to tour in the district and exercise supervision over the Waqf land. Miscellaneous and Special Revenues .—These taxes, which produce only a fifth of the demand from land revenue, are always liable to be overshadowed by the latter, and, moreover, in the year under review the imperative necessity of providing grain for the army has distracted attention from all other revenue matters. Yet these revenues are even now expected to jneld three lakhs, and will produce more under proper supervision and management. At present they are administered on the Turkish system, of which the best that can be said is that it added to the attraction of Government service by affording underpaid officials numerous facilities for increasing their incomes. There is little to be said about the individual taxes. Owing to restriction of the main fishing ground at the barrage it was found necessary to reduce the farm of the fish tax by 25 per cent., and the date tax will yield a little less than the budget estimate. All other taxes show an excess over the estimates. The fruit and vegetable, fish, slaughter and liquor taxes were farmed, the-others being collected direct. I regret that for the reasons mentioned it has been impossible to give these taxes the attention they require, and I have not sufficient information to discuss them in detail, but it is evident that radical changes are necessary. These revenues are open to almost every objection that can be made against a tax. They are vexatives because they are collected direct in small sums, collection is difficult and expensive, adequate supervision is impossible, the people are liable to be dunned twice for the same amount, and there is every opportunity for fraud, which the so-called system of accounts most effectively conceals. For example, a man who purchases sheep out of a flock on which kodah has been paid, must go with the seller to the Mamur Kodah and obtain a new receipt lest he also be required to pay the tax. Similarly, the tax on vegetables is collected both in the field and in the market, and only the collector s knowledge of the local growers prevents a double collection. Why there have been no complaints on these grounds I cannot understand. The date, fruit, and vegetable taxes will, I presume, ultimately be merged in the general land revenue. Meanwhile in 1919 I hope that it will be possible to exercise a proper check on the count of trees. Kodah is an impossible sort of tax; a genuine check is out of the question, and I think it would be best to farm the tax by tribes to the Shaikhs. The farmer’s profit would probably nearly balance the cost of direct collection, which in 1918 amounted to Rs. 3,274/8/-for a demand of Rs 72,050/- _ Petition stamps are now bought singly from the office, an obviously objectionable practice, but T am applying for sanction to a proposal to sell petition stamps at a discount to petition writers, who will become licensed vendors on paj^ment of a small fee. I hope to take up the question of these miscellaneous taxes before long and to submit a report in detail. (C) Customs. —Nil. (D) Compensation. Considerable sums have been paid on account of compen sation for land taken up for military purposes. At present, compensation has been paid on account of damage done by the destruction of crops and trees, &amp;c., but rent for land in military occupation is now being assessed. No rules existed for the assessment of damage, and an application to the Revenue Board for guidance produced little result. As no directions based on the practice of other Lessing officers were available, 1 was compelled to work out a system of my own, whichI have embodied in a note given as Appendix B. The working out of a system took up much time, which might have been devoted to other work, and I add the note to this report in the hope that it may save some trouble to other officers. I am well aware of its defects, but it was difficult to gather accurate information and impossible to foresee prices, and I had not the benefit of other officers’ experiencew The procedure employed was worked out in conjunction with the D.A.Q.M.G., and was published in Area Orders. A department or formation requiring land submits its requirements to the G.O.C. in detail, with a plan, if necessary, showing exactly what is needed and what damage will be done to trees, irrigation channels, &amp;c. If the G.O.C. considers the proposals to be jprimd facie sound the matter is referred to a committee consisting of an A.P.O., an Irrigation Officer, and a local inhabitant, for assessment of compensation to be paid, and report to the G.O.C., who, having considered the cost, either allots the land or refuses sanction. In urgent cases the G.O.C. permits entry into the land previous to the assessment of compensation. This system has always worked extremely well. The principle of assessment before occupation is most desirable, not only in order that the A.P.O. and Irrigation Officer may submit any objections for the consideration of the G.O.C., but also that the G.O.C. may know the cost of the proposal before according sanction. Compensation work has been heavy. The total number of compensation statements, each of which includes numerous recipients of compensation, is 48, and the total amount paid is Rs. 43,940/3/-. (E) Miscellaneous : (1) Accounts .—A new system of revenue accounts has been worked out and is now in course of introduction. In compiling it I was fortunate in obtaining the assistance of Chaudri Nizam-ud-Din, late Treasury Officer, while Lieut. Brown of the Financial Assistant’s Office subsequently criticised the orders. These are contained in two circulars given as Appendix C. The accounts at present are chaotic, the staff is untrained, while the Turkish system in force might have been specially designed to defy any attempt at inspection or audit. Little progress can be made with a system that lumps together slaughter house receipts and bridge tolls, and records them jointly as kodah. This is an actual instance. (2) Mugharisji Lands .—I have already remarked on the number of villages in the district. Nearly all of these are surrounded by date groves, which are cultivated on special tenures. Many disputes about these groves have come before me, and I have written a note on the subject, which is attached to this report as Appendix D. The remarks therein contained are based on experience gained in hearing disputes and by local inspection, and not only on conversation with Mallaks, but the note is necessarily incomplete as regards this district, and certainly could not be accepted without inquiry as applicable to any other. I trust, however, that it may be of use as an indication of some points that need attention and as a means of eliciting the experience and opinions of other officers. (3) Case Work .—There are three principal classes of revenue cases, whether the land in dispute is mugharisji or not, i.e., claims for a share of the profit, petitions for a delimitation of boundaries, and petitions for a declaration of right. A petition on the face of it may be any sort of a claim, but it nearly always resolves into one of the kinds mentioned. With very rare exceptions, all cases were decided on the basis of possession, and the party in possession of the land was confirmed therein. It is clear that possession may be of various kinds; for exaipple, possession by a cultivating fallah differs from that of a mallak. The principle appears to operate hardly in some cases, but no other is practicable. All orders passed are of a temporary nature, and hold good only till settlement. In State lands, other than mugharisji holdings, I think no one has a legal right, though certain claims will, doubtless, be recognised later on, and the lands be allotted permanently or tempo rarily to'cultivators by the Revenue authorities. An aggrieved tapu owner can always put forward at settlement with his claim to tapu rights, a claim for arrears of profit, though whether such a claim will be entertained in another matter. I am strongly of opinion that all disputes concerning agricultural land should be disposed of by Political Officers in their capacity as Revenue Officers, and should not come before' the Civil Courts. I have dealt with this question at some length in a memorandum dated 24th June 1918 and addressed to the P.O. Hillah, an extract from which is attached as Appendix E. The memorandum is concerned mainly with the land other than gardens, but the considerations therein apply140 equally to gardens. I do not think it will be denied that all matters affecting the tribes should be kept in the hands of the A.P.O., and the management of the land is very intimately connected with the welfare of the tribes. It has been suggested, however, that disputes concerning gardens should be disposed of by the Civil Court, on the grounds that the boundaries of a garden are well defined, that the rights of the parties are easily ascertainable from sanads, and that the gardens are entirely distinct from other land. This view is based on a misapprehension of the facts. The boundaries are not at all well-defined, in most cases there are no sanads, and, as I have pointed out in my remarks on mugharisji holdings, the gardens and the neighbouring land merge into each other, and are generally held by the same fallahs. An even more important point is that exactly the same problem as await decision in tapu land are found in garden holdings. In each case the mallak’s more or less legal right is set against the acutal fact that his right was never enforced, and I consider it would be most inadvisable to constitute different authorities for dealing with an identical problem. On the arrival of the Judicial Officer at Hillah, it was arranged that no case affecting agricultural land, including groves, should be taken up by the Civil Court without reference to the A.P.O. In practice this meant that suits between mallaks or between fallahs, which generally involved question of inheritance or sale, have been decided by the Judicial Officer, while disputes between mallak and fallah involving questions of revenue policy have remained with the A.P.O. This system has worked extremely well, and I consider it should be perpetuated. 3. Irrigation. —No great extension was possible before the 1918, but during the past year the following extensions have been carried out, and will bring more land under cultivation in. 1919 :— Mahawil ‘Amyat al Pasha - Nil - - - Bashiyah and Qudis ‘Alaq - Shomali Dalamiyah - Salaliyah Amin al ‘Alush Nahr Shah - ‘Alaj - - - Hashimiyah - with command of 9? 17 sq. m. 10 15 3 2J 11 1 H 49“ 22J 1 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 This constitutes a fairly large extension, and I am inclined to the view that no more large works should be undertaken for the present. The necessitv for growing a large amount of grain for the Army has passed, and, as this year’s experience shows, it will be difficult to collect enough labour for clearances. The Arab may not be a hard worker, but his nature cannot be changed in a moment, and we must take him as we find him, and make our arrangements according^. Extensions necessitate increase of establishment, and I am strongly opposed to the multiplication of subordinate officials, unless adequate supervision by British Officers can be ensured, but the last budget offers little hope of this. A project put forward in the spring for a very large extension of the Nil was abandoned, and the proposal to dig the new Jarbuffyah Canal was dropped in October on the joint representation of the P.O. and D.LO. . Tho clearance of the Nahr Shah was not completed, and the increase in culti vation will be less than was expected. I was reluctantly compelled to call out villagers who would get no water from the canal, a procedure which I consider inadvisable, but even with their assistance the work was not properly finished Other clearances were carried out satisfactorily. . . During the spring and summer there were numerous complaints against irrigation subordinates, many of whom are not only mere boys, but are drawn from a class detested by the tribes. They behaved in an arrogant and domineering manner, which was much resented, and one of them went so far as to throw away contemptuously the dinner provided for him by his host, a minor Shaikh* but latterly complaints on this score have ceased. These occurrences^ were most unfortunate as they have rendered the Irrigation Department unpopular with the people, and 1 fear it will be some time before the proper feeling of confidence isrestored, and the cultivators come to regard Irrigation Officials as among their best friends. It is now, I presume, only a matter of months before the Irrigation Department comes under the Civil Commissioner, and I trust that it will then be possible to define more accurately the respective spheres of Political and Irrigation Officers. At present, the attitude of the Irrigation Department seems to be that a Political Officer has no concern with any question affecting water supply, and that the opening and closing of canals, the saving of one man’s crop at the expense of another’s, &amp;c., are matters for the decision of the D.I.O. alone. Irrigation Officers even object to the presentation of petitions concerning water to Political Officers, and decline to give their opinion on these when asked to do so on the ground that the petitions should be addressed to an official of their department. Apart from the obvious necessity of maintaining the right of any person to petition his P.O. or A.P.O., the effect of this attitude is to deprive a Political Officer of one of his most useful means of administration, as well as of the opinion of an irrigation expert, and to exclude political considerations from all irrigation matters. Moreover, it is considered by irrigation officers that petitions should be presented not to the D.I.O. but to the section officer. A section officer is a subordinate official ranking below an A.I.O., and I consider it unseemly that the Shaikh of a tribe should be required to present himself as a suppliant before a person of that class. The question of petitions was taken up strongly in his 2,111 FI of 9th August 1918 to the Civil Commissioner by the late P.O. Hillah, who dealt also with general questions in his 1,831 FI of 17th July 1918 to the Revenue and Financial Secretary. Ultimately the only workable method will probably be that an Irrigation Officer should be the technical adviser of the P.O. or A.P.O., whose decision on any point not purely technical would hold good unless reversed by his superiors, it being not for the Political Officer but for the Irrigation Officer to appeal to higher authority in case of disagreement. In practice, the Political Officer would seldom find it necessary to interpose, and, except as regards new works and extensions, he would probably not concern himself with such questions unless things were not going well; but, subject to the control of higher authority, the decision would rest with him if he chose to take the matter up. This system may not be practicable now, but I suggest that at present, just as under the Director of Irrigation’s orders, original works are not to be undertaken without reference to the Political Officers ; so, before any distribution of water likely to cause loss to cultivators is made, or similar action taken, the P.O. or A.P.O. should be consulted by the D.I.O. Similarly as regards petitions, I suggest that just as the Political Officer informs the D.I.O. of his opinion of a proposal from a political point of view, so the D.I.O. should, when asked, give the Political Officer the benefit of his opinion on the applicant’s request, and, generally, inform the Political Officer what action he considers advisable in any matter about which his opinion is requested. There is no question of subordinating one Department to the other, but the situation is clearly impossible if Irrigation Officers decline to give Political Officers information, merely because a petition was not addressed to them. 4. Agriculture : Farms .—Captain Cameron, Circle Officer, arrived here in August last, and has started a small farm on the Barrage Road. At present he is confining himself to growing fodder for the dairy farm, and to experimenting with Indian wheat. The land was occupied without my knowledge, and the site is not suitable, being on tapu land and disputed tapu land at that. Before next season it will probably be advisable to shift the farm to the Wardiyah canal, where the land is Mudawarrah. A stud bull, which was imported, broke loose, and ultimately perished after spreading terror over the surrounding country. Potatoes .—Potato seed was issued to three or four land-owners, from whom we raised an excellent crop, but the other crops failed. The Government share of the successful crop was set aside as seed, but unfortunately it rotted. I think the cultivation of the potato, which is popular as a food with such Arabs as have tried it, should be extended, but it is necessary to proceed cautiously as with any new crop, for each failure discourages several prospective cultivators. Probably the best method would be to grow a plot of potatoes on the Circle Officer’s farm as a demonstration, and to give out a small quantity of seed on very easy terms to selected land-holders who would cultivate under the Circle Officer’s supervision. I trust that some means of keeping potatoes through the summer will be discovered.142 Fruit. —Gardens near Hillah are numerous, and there is scope for a considerable extension of fruit cultivation. Peaches, nectarines, apricots, figs, and plums are grown, but the varieties are poor, and the introduction of better kinds would be welcomed. Dates. —The date harvest was successful. It would be interesting to know what are the commercial prospects of this crop. The people, if left to themselves, will certainly extend the area under palms, but I have no information as to what the demand for dates will be in the future, whether it is likely to increase, or whether it would be better to turn the minds of cultivators towards other crops. I would like to know whether there are any prospects of manufacturing sugar from dates. Shitwi. —The shitwi harvest was a good one, though in Mahawil some lands were flooded, and there was a certain amount of damage from locusts. In certain areas wild oats are prevalent, and I would be glad to know what steps are recommended by expert opinion for the removal of this growth. A good deal of the land is “ tired ” from overcultivation, due in some cases to the condition requiring those who received advances to sow all their land. Presumably the remedy for this is rotation of crops, and it would be interesting to know whether the sugar beet could be grown and whether it would provide the necessary rotation. If the Agricultural Department considers the beet to be a suitable crop, and is prepared to start a small sugar factory on a demonstration farm, I do not think there would be any difficulty in inducing the quick-minded Arab to take up the cultivation. I hope that it will be possible to supply A.P.O.s with more information as to the possibilities of new crops and the commercial value of all produce, and with close co-operation between agricultural and Political Officers, together with practical demonstrations, I do not doubt that the introduction of new crops will be easy. Saifi. —The saifi crop was on the whole successful, though rotation between the Hillah and Hindiyah channels decreased the supply of water available. The assessed demand and collections for each kind of grain are given in Appendix A. Cattle. —Ploughing in the district is carried out partly by oxen and partly by horses. The supply of the former is not excessive, and has been decreased by purchases on account of the Army, which, I trust, will now diminish. Applications have been received for 24 Government bullocks. A suggestion that ploughing by buffaloes should be popularised by naming an animal after the Political Officer, was not received with enthusiasm by either party, and the Macpherson buffalo did not materialise. Machinery.—The administration of the pumps became hopelessly confused owing to different instructions being given to E. and M., Circle, and Political Officers. A satisfactory arrangement has now been made with the E. and M. Officer, whereby the latter undertakes all repairs, the A.P.O. guaranteeing payment, and’generally looking after the pumps in non-technical matters. Three applications to purchase Government pumps have been received, but the price is not yet known and may prove to be too high. J 5. Municipal : Buildings.—During the greater part of 1917 the town presented a deplorable appearance. At the time of the revolt the tribes and some of the towns people broke into the sarai and many other buildings, and the returnino- Turks completed the work of destruction. Not content with shelling the town after their entry they blew up many of the houses, and two whole mahallahs were almost destroyed There are still many ruined houses, but much re-building has been 5 w C !r The sarai has been restored and is now tenanted by Resources and the I.U.l., and all the buildings along the river front which have been taken over for military purposes are now in good order. Unfortunately the local inhabitants cannot afford to rebuild their houses at the present price of labour and materials while many houses have been requisitioned for billets so that accommodation is very inadequate and the people are suffering considerable inconvenience. Roads. Roads have been made from the north end of the town on the bank of the river to join the Barrage Road, from the same point over Tnew pi e bridge to the station, while a road from the Kufah road to the Barrage Road on the west of the town is nearly completed. All works have been carried by the Irriyatfon Department under military orders and at military expense. 7 lrri g atl0n Taxation and Development.-ANith the exception of the house tax of 10 ner cent on the assessed rental, no tax has been imposed which was not in force unto the Turkish rule; but the rates of some taxes have been raised, collections have143 % Arable lu ms ate ^Idl* hoir ^Ives, battle whether 1 would ^ dates, nds were ain areas amended “tired” received °f crops, awn and 'artment ’ factory 'nducing possible and the oral and diat the r een the e.

The revised budget indicates a balance of Rs. 34,700 on the year’s working, but this is more apparent than real. At present the baladiyah does not discharge its obligations. The cost of all roads is defrayed from military funds, nothing is contributed to the hospital or to education, and the expenditure on lighting is far too low. The sanitation of the town leaves a good deal to be desired, and more money must be spent under that head. The Snq is sorely in need of repair; there is no butchers’ market, and the vegetable market is not very suitable. In view of the shortage of accommodation and the desirability of getting the ruined houses repaired as soon as possible it would probably be advisable, as soon as prices moderate, to make advances to house owners for the repair of their property. The execution of these and other reforms would require more money than is available. Most of them are urgent, and fresh sources of income must be sought. It is always inexpedient for a new Government to start on its career by imposing fresh taxation, and I would prefer to raise money by indirect means. The people have not complained about the house-tax, but I am reluctant to introduce other direct taxes. It is probable that in 1919 receipts under all heads will increase slightly, and the rates of the license tax might be raised, but more is required than can be obtained in this way. Taxation is less felt when indirect, and a considerable source of income could be derived from a terminable tax on imports levied at the railway station. Octroi offers too many opportunities for peculation and bears too hardly on the small cultivator to be a satisfactory tax. It would be desirable to acquire some of the soda-water, ice, electric light, and water plant now in the country, as soon as this is no longer required by the Army. Waterworks would probably not pay their way, though in view of the quickness of the Arab to recognise an improvement, this is doubtful; but the sale of mineral waters and ice and provision of electric light would, I think, be remunerative undertakings, and there is now an excellent opportunity of establishing these industries on a firm footing before competition begins. Before setting up a municipal electric light plant careful inquiries would be necessary, and a loan from Government would be required, but, provided the machines can be obtained, there is no reason why the sale of ice and mineral waters should not begin at once. I am considering a proposal for tax on oil which was levied by the Turks, but I am inclined to suggest that oil be made a Government monopoly for the benefit of municipalities. Consumption in view of the lack of fuel, the proximity of the oil fields, and the probable extension of the use of oil engines, is certain to be very high, and the profits of the monopoly corre spondingly large, while at the same time it should be possible to sell the oil to the people at a lower rate than any prevailing in former days. No great interest is being taken in their town by the people of Hillah, but under a military occupation interest is hardly to be expected. I am endeavouring to induce them to call on me and discuss means of improving the mnnicipality, and I hope that slowly a source of civic pride may develop. The one exception to the general apathy is the Rais Baladiyah, ‘Abdul Razzaq Chalabi. This gentleman has always been a steady supporter of British rule and has thrown himself indefatigably into all schemes for the benefit of the town. His ability and industry have been invaluable. 6. Judicial. —At the beginning of the year all judicial work, except for a few important cases, was done by the A.P.O., Town. On my arrival as A.P.O. District those from outside the municipality were transferred to me. f have already dealt with revenue cases. Owing to the pressure of other work, it was impossible to take up civil suits arising outside the town until the arrival o1 a Judicial Officer in October. In the town a panel of 14 prominent townsmen representing all creeds was formed, and from this two members were selected daily to sit for the trial of civil cases. By this method the possibilities of collusion with parties were minimised. The A.P.O., Town, and Rais Baladiyah, to whom a certain number of cases was transferred, sat with the members selected for the day. This system has been satisfactory, and I think it is worthy of continuance. A small cause court might be formed under the supervision of the judicial officer, consisting of not more than one paid official sitting with two honorary assessors chosen from the panel. Such a court would he both cheaper and more popular than one composed of a bench of three native judges. These questions, however, pertain rather to the judicial branch of the administration. Since the opening of the court of first Instance at Hillah no civil cases have been tried by A.P.O.s, though an occasional tribal dispute is referred to a Shaikh.144 The Qadhi has had little work to do, as there are few Sunnis in this district. Cases involving points of Shar‘ah law have been referred to Saiyid Muhammad Ali Qazwini, whose decision is almost invariably respected by the parties. Saiyid Muhammad ‘Ali has rendered valuable service in this respect, but he declines to accept a salary. Civil cases have nearly all been of a trivial nature. Applications by women for maintenance orders, and suits for the recovery of small debts are the most common. Suits relating to immovable property have been temporarily settled on the basis of possession. ' An increase in the number of civil cases will follow the extension of trade on the return of Peace conditions. Criminal .—The amount of crime in the town is extraordinarily small. The streets are most inadequately lighted, there are no police patrols, and the only protection of property at night is a body of ancient Dogberrys who slumber fitfully in the market, and yet there have been practically no burglaries and few thefts. I trust that this phenomenon is due rather to the natural tendencies of the people than to a temporary fear of the new regime. In the district, except for certain classes of cases, such as thefts of Government grain from boats and highway robbery, the policy has been to leave the disposal of criminals as much as possible in the hands of the Shaikhs. A complainant to the A.P.O., if a tribesman, is required to go first to his own Shaikh and bring from him a certificate that he believes the crime to have been committed. He then goes with his petition to the Shaikh of the accused and demands justice. If he is not satisfied he can complain to the A.P.O., or ask his own Shaikh to do so. A townsman follows the same procedure, except that he goes direct from A.P.O. to the accused’s Shaikh. This method has worked excellently. In a dispute between members of the same tribe, the influence of the Shaikh may prevent a case of injustice from reaching the ears of the A.P.O., but I do not think such cases are common by reason of the rarity of appeals from members of other tribes or from townsmen, who have no fear of incurring the enmity of the deciding Shaikh. The only drawback is the difficulty of inducing Shaikhs to send the A.P.O. copies of their awards, for reference in case of a recurrence of the quarrel. Some cases are never reported, being settled by the Shaikh or by some chosen arbitrator. It has very seldom been necessary to take action to enforce the order of a Shaikh. A certain number of important cases have been decided by the A.P.O., generally with the assistance of one or more Shaikhs. I am strongly in favour if the continuance of this method. Politically, it is one of the props of the tribal system and emphasises the authority of the Shaikh. It is popular with the people, and it has secured as much justice, order, and freedom from crime as could be obtained by any other means. The extension to the tribes of European forms of criminal procedure would be most inadvisable, and I have already received a nervous inquiry on this point from the chief Shaikh of the district. Serious crime, for which the penalty under tribal law is inadequate, can always be dealt with by the A.P.O. Crime in the villages has been treated much as crime among the tribes, but the circumstances of the villages and their connection with the surrounding tribes vary so much that generalisation as to the action taken is impossible. A villager would nearly always prefer that his case be decided according to tribal law, and in most cases he willingly accepts the order of the neighbouring Shaikh. The commonest offences have been those of highway robbery, murder, and assault. Thefts among the tribes are generally committed not so much for gain as in the course of an attempt to settle by the strong hand an outstanding claim for “ fash” Except in special cases, where a more severe punishment was called for, these have been settled under tribal law j but I am now issuing a notice that in future offenders will be liable not only to pay damages to the aggrieved party, but also to satisfy the claim of Government against them, either by paying a fine or by suffering imprisonment. General.—The people are remarkably willing to refer their disputes to arbitration, and the decision of an arbitrator is almost invariably accepted without demur. ? Saiyid Muhammad ‘Ali is the referee generally selected. Great respect is paid to the sanctity of the oath, and almost every question can be settled if one party will agree to swear at the tomb of ‘Abbas at Karbala. There is always a temptation to have recourse to this facile method of dealing with a difficult case, but to preserve the binding force of an oath it should be used sparingly. To require all witnessesin a judicial proceeding to swear would be to prostitute the oath and to destroy the restraint it now imposes. It would be better that witnesses should simply state that they would speak the truth. If a binding form of oath is used in a court of law it soon loses its terror, while any other form is useless save as a means towards a subsequent prosecution for perjury, an end attainable as easily by the use of a simple affirmation. A kStatement is attached as Appendix F showing the number of offences for which sentence of imprisonment was passed. 7. Education. In Turkish times there were in Hillah three Muhammadan schools, and two Jewish, one for girls and one for boys. Of the former, one is in use as the Baladiyah office, and all the latter were seriously damaged in the riots of 1916. No schools could be opened till September when teachers arrived from Baghdad. A subscription of Rs. 6,000/-, which Government will double, was raised, repairs to one of the Muhammadan schools were taken in hand, and the building will shortly be ready for occupation. Meanwhile the school is accommodated in the Jama‘ Kabir. At present 80 boys are on the registers, but when the new building is available there will be room for 200. The boys attending the school were selected by Captain Livesey “from the better classes, with consideration for the poorer families and Turkish pensioners.” The demand for education is keen and more schools will be required, but I understand that, as might be expected, there is a difficulty in providing teachers. It is certainly desirable that the upper forms should be taught English. The Jews have started the repair of their schools, but progress is slow for want of material. There are at present no schools outside the town, but as soon as teachers are available I would like to start schools at Imam Hamzah, Barmanah, Dablah, Jimjimah, and other villages. I trust that the ghastly Indian mistake of extending secondary education at the expense of primary will not be repeated in ‘Iraq. The provision of facilities for secondary education should be largely a matter for the people themselves. Fees should be charged in all but elementary schools, and even in these education should not be free to the children of those who can afford to pay for it. It is desirable that provision be made for the education of Shaikhs’ sons, and no doubt this question is engaging the attention of the authorities. Boys of this class should not be sent to urban schools to herd with townsmen and be corrupted by the manifold vices of an ‘Iraq city, nor should they associate with those whom their parents regard as their inferiors. It would probably be found best to start a special residential school for them in rural surroundings, where as much attention would be paid to games and agriculture as to book learning. 8 8. Medical and Sanitation.— A civil' dispensary was started in February, and in May a hospital with accommodation for in-patients was opened. It is impossible to exaggerate the benefits which these institutions have conferred, or their popularity with the people. Even when the only available medical skill was that of an idle and incompetent Bengali sub-assistant surgeon, the attendance of patients was high, but the number has increased beyond knowledge since the opening of the new hospital and the arrival of a new sub-assistant surgeon. The town is deeply indebted to Captain Campbell Begg, R.A.M.C., who undertook the charge of the hospital and worked unceasingly for the benefit of the people. The appointment of a regular civil surgeon is the most pressing necessity of the town. No doubt the organisation of a medical service for ‘Iraq is under consideration, but I confess I am unable to understand why, now that peace has come, it has not been found possible to depute a medical officer as civil surgeon pending the organisa tion of a medical service. It is difficult to believe that there are no officers to be spared and no officers willing to serve. The political value of such an appointment would be inestimable. Fees are charged from in-patients at the rate of Rs. 1/- per day, but all patients are seen on discharge by an A.P.O., and the fees are remitted in cases of poverty. The hospital building is not entirely suitable, and it would be advisable to erect a new one when funds permit. Part of the cost should be borne by the municipality, which should also contribute to the upkeep. Sanitation .—At the beginning of the year sanitation was carried out by means of four gangs of sweepers, of whom two worked under the Military authorities and were employed in the small Military area, while the others were occupied with the rest of the town. Latrines and incinerators were erected; Captain Livesey, late146 A.P.O., Town, relates that one of the former was ignored in highly contemptuous manner because it was facing Mecca. In September a contract was made for the cleaning of the streets by means of 30 sweepers and 15 donkeymen at Rs. 1,200/- per mensem. It has been impossible to build a sufficient number of latrines owing to the scarcity of materials, and it is hopeless to expect the people to refrain from insanitary practices until latrines are provided. Early in December the G.O.C. area “ counted two and seventy stenches, all well-defined, and several stinks,” and forthwith ordered a committee to meet immediately and submit a scheme to be executed forthwith. A scheme was prepared with Military promptitude, but an inquiry as to what funds were to bear the cost has received no reply. It is unlikely that any more will be heard of the proposals. The question of sanitation must be taken in hand before long, but it is useless to try to rush the matter. Inquiries should be made from other towns, both in order to ascertain what methods have proved successful, and to avoid ill-considered expenditure and waste of money. The municipality is none too wealthy; demands on its resources will increase in the near future, and it is essential that its funds be not frittered away on systems that further experience would condemn. The people have hardly heard of sanitation, and the idea is not popular. Given time, they will probably appreciate the advantages of cleanliness, and it is far more politic and more effective to go slowly with public opinion than to dragoon the inhabitants. As for hustling the East, the end of the fight is a tombstone white. I am informed that pit latrines have been found the most suitable to the country, and they have the advantage that they are of a kind known to the people. I propose to make inquiries on the point. I do not like incinerators. They require a constant supply of fuel, and diligent supervision, and the fumes they discharge render them naturally unpopular with those unfortunate enough to live in their vicinity. If proper arrangements could be made, I would prefer the institution of trenching grdunds, which, incidentally, form a valuable source of revenue. The indigeneous system of sanitation consists in pits inside the houses. These are cleaned out at long intervals; a wealthy citizen informed me proudly that his pit required cleaning only once in a 100 years. Captain Livesey remarks : “ The roads have a central system of drainage into pits, which are several feet deep, bricked up round the sides, with a small opening on the road surface. These have given way sometimes and caused trouble in repairs, but they serve their purpose well enough in those streets which are free from animal traffic, and with an occasional dose of strong disinfectant they are not really objectionable. The same system in the courtyards of the houses is much worse, owing to the large amount of water poured into them, and their being confined by the four sides of the house. In billets taken, these are being treated with strong disinfectant and they are then sealed up.” 9. Police. —The Civil Police were formed in April with a sanctioned strength of one inspector and 22 N.C.O.s and men. An Arab head constable was sent from Baghdad, and the men were given a certain amount of infantry drill. The force is supposed to effect arrests, serve summonses, and provide a day and night guard at the baladiyah; but arrests are seldom required, there are few summonses, and the guard at the baladiyah is unnecessary. At present the men are principally used to catch offenders against sanitary rules, a duty which they perform without conspicuous success. The police are quartered in the baladiyah, some little distance from the A.P.O.’s office; which is unfortunate, but unavoidable in view of the lack of accommodation. A Police force of some sort is necessary, but in the present circumstances it is difficult to exercise a proper control and to prevent those acts of oppression which generally render an Oriental Police so unpopular. The future of the Police must largely depend on the use to which it is intended to put the Shabanah but the time has not yet come for the institution of Police stations or posts outside the town, and certainly Police should not be habitually employed among the tribes As a magistrate, an A.P.O. feels the want of an investigating staff which might on occasion be employed in the villages as well as in the town. Criminal cases are never sent up by mamurs in a, proper state, and the local inquiry made by them is generally useless. One or two trained inspectors would be of considerable utility but it would be necessary to exercise the greatest care in supervision and I would prefer that the appointment of such officials be postponed until proVision can be made for a British Police officer, preferably drawn from the Indian Police who are familiar with the peculiar difficulties and dangers of the work. British s ? uper-vision is essential to Police work, and though there would not be enough work for a British officer in the Hillah district, one might be appointed for the Hillah Division. It would then be possible to extend the activities of the Police, and make over to them the protection of the property in the city and the control of traffic, duties at present performed respectively by a contractor for night watchmen and the Military Police. 10. Shabanah. In the following remarks I assume that the Shabanah are to be regarded simply as a Police force, and I treat the subject entirely from the point of view of a district officer. From that point of view the Shabanah do not show results commensurate with the trouble and money expended on them. Their training has been conducted entirely on military lines, and attention has been paid only to the military side of Police duties. A force of this nature is of little use to the district administration. Drill and manoeuvre, should, I think, be only sufficient to give smartness and discipline to the force, and to enable it to execute such simple operations as the surrounding of a village, and military training should be sub ordinated to training in the work of a civil Police force. At present, after a year’s hard work, the Shabanah have reached a state of Military efficiency which I am not capable of gauging, but their practical utility to the civil power is of the slightest. There is nothing the Shabanah do that could not be as well done by Police, and Police would carry out many other duties which are not attempted by the Shabanah. I fully recognise that the Shabanah have rendered good service on various occasions. I do consider, however, that for employment in this district, their sphere is too narrow and that a Police force, armed and civil, would be of much greater utility. The Shabanah are a divisional force, and supply men from all five districts, so that it is difficult for an A.P.O. to gauge the strength required, but I think an inquiry would show that the present numbers are excessive, and that reductions could be made. I have pointed out the necessity for placing the Police under a British officer appointed for that purpose, and I think no useful purpose would be served by maintaining two district bodies. I suggest that the existing civil Police be absorbed in the Shabanah, who would thenceforward be treated as Police and employed in the repression of crime, and the protection of property, and as an armed reserve in the hands of the local executive to be used in case of disturbance. It would be desirable to secure the services of an officer of the Indian Police in the Division in an advisory capacity if not in command of the force. The danger that a Shabanah or Police force will degenerate into an instrument of tyranny and oppression, though not always rqcognised, is a very real one, and can be best met by officers who know from experience the difficulties that may be anticipated, and the methods of dealing with them. It has been suggested that pressure should be brought to bear on the Arabs to enlist, and on the Shaikhs to provide recruits. In view of the people’s notorious hatred of conscription, I consider that any form of compulsion would be most injurious, not only to the administration as a whole, but to the prospects of the Shabanah. In the year under review there was a most unfortunate occurrence at Jarbuhyah, when a number of men were taken away from their village and forcibly enlisted. They were subsequently released, but the incident had a most unhappy effect in the district, and was a serious set-back to the popularity of the Shabanah. It would be far better to let the force stand on its own merits and attract recruits by favourable conditions of service. 11. Labour. —The supply of labour has been chronically insufficient, despite the presence of imported labour corps. This fact is due mainly to the presence of the Army, which has made large demands notably for roads and the harvest, while the construction of three different railways necessitated the provision of yet more labourers. The supply of skilled labour was sufficient in times of peace, but nearly all the artizans were required for Military purposes, and those that were not taken were not enough for the civil population. The provision and control of labour was vested in an A.D.L., but that officer was unable to produce labour for the various granaries outside the town, and this duty was undertaken by the A.P.O. The majority of the labourers employed on Government work are small boys and old men, as the able-bodied men are needed for cultivation, and the release of Government labour will not set free a large number for agriculture. As I have observed, in my remarks on irrigation, the supply of labour is likely to be scantyfor some years to come, and cultivation will suffer if extensive schemes are under taken. It is already necessary to make calls on the people for the repair of flood banks and the clearance of canals, duties which they perform without enthusiasm, and care should be exercised before new demands are made on the labour available. The rates for labour are high, and despite the fall in the price of grain, show no signs of abatement, for the demand continues as great as ever. I am preparing figures showing the probable demand for labour for each w T ork in the district, showing the number of men required, and the time at which they are wanted, and this will further the organisation of labour. The current census, when completed, will be of service in this respect. 12. Miscellaneous : Railways.—DuTing the year under review the broad gauge line from Baghdad to Hillah and the narrow gauge line from Hillah to Kifl were completed, while the earthwork for the Hillah Nasiriyah line was carried beyond Jarbuiyah. Compensation was paid only for damage to crops. Two trucks a day from Hillah to Baghdad are now available for passengers and one for goods, which is allotted to merchants by the R.T.O. The railway is very popular, and despite the raising of the fare to Rs. 5/-, the number of applicants for tickets always exceeds the accommodation available. Oil. —After various misunderstandings, the distribution of oil to the civil population was undertaken at the end of the year. Shops have been opened in Hillah and in one or two villages, at which oil is sold at fixed prices, but the needs of the people were under-estimated, and the supply at present falls far short of the demand. Several more shops are required. Pensions and Subsistence Allownace. —I attach a note by Capt. Livesey who was in charge of this work till the end of November. (Appendix G.) Appendix H shows the numbers of each class of pensioner and the allowances paid. Billets. —I attach a note by Captain Livesey. (Appendix I.) Jail. —The original jail building was small and unsafe and two prisoners escaped from it. The new jail is satisfactory. It receives prisoners undergoing sentences not exceeding two years from the Hillah, Musaiyib, Hindiyah, and Karbala districts. Diwaniyah has its own jail, but it would probably be more economical if all prisoners with over one month’s sentence were confined at Hillah. The following report by Captain Livesey gives all the information required. There are now two B.O.R.s as assistant jailors, but the question of reduction is under consideration. Appendix J gives the number of prisoners received and the offences committed. Hillah Civil Jail. —A short report on the new prison building, together with a record of prisoners, equipment, and the diet expenses for June, July, August and September 1918. 1. New Jail Building : (i) General. —The building is a well-built sif which has been adapted for this purpose. Though taken over on May 16th 1918. The necessary repairs delayed the transfer from the old jail until 10th August. It is owned by the heirs of the late Hasan Hammadi. The rent as for other sifs, is somewhat high, Rs. 1,500/- per annum, but it was the only possible place after local resources had refused to allow the lower portion of the sarai to be utilised for this purpose. I may add that the sarai contained the old and specialised Turkish prison. (ii) Accommodation. —With some alteration, the prison should hold 200. Seven partially open rooms, barbed wired above, contain 10 each. These have been fitted with good doors and locks. The remaining big rooms are immensely strong and have stout wooden doors. All rooms and cells open into the central courtyard, from which escape to tlie roof would be extremely difficult. Both the inner and outer boundaries of the roof are barbwired and a sentry patrols between them. A strong wall has been built to divide the Shabanah guard and jailor’s quarters from the prison proper It is wired along the top and has a central gate the top part of which is barred through which the guard can see the main prison yard and the sentry therein The mam gate is a heavy structure. Thus there is a double gate, which is desirable and the guard are separated from the prisoners. (hi) Equipment—The inventory is attached.2. Establishment, (i) Jailor and one B.O.R. assistant. Sergt. G. A. Richmond, M.F.P., who has professional knowledge of his work, has been invaluable. His keenness and ability are responsible for the good work, discipline and sanitation of the prison. His powers with the “ cat ” are appreciated. Corpl. Gibson as assistant jailor was found unsuitable and was returned to Baghdad on 13th September, 1918; his place being taken by Pte. McMahon. The total staff consists of the jailor, his assistant, and an Arab kawas. (ii) Shabanah Guard. —The guard consists of two N.C.O.s and fifteen men, from which a minimum jail guard of one N.C.O. and nine men must always be present. Escorts for prisoners sent for trial are found from the guard. An escort of one N.C.O. and five men report twice daily for the working party. The sentries are placed one on the roof, one in the yard, and one at the main gate. Two of them are doubled by night. An electric light lights up the entire roof at night. 3. Prisoners. —The number has varied between 41 and 70. There have been no escapes up to date. (i) Diet. —This is based on the Baghdad scale of diet. Meal hours are :— Morning - - - - - - 6 a.m. Midday - - - - - - 12 noon. Evening - - - - - - 6 p.m. Four prisoners cook. For the four months, June-September, the number of prisoners fed reached a total of 7,278 ; these were fed at a cost of Rs. 2,794/10/-, including the cost of firewood. The average cost works out per head per diem at 6 to 14 annas. (ii) Work .—During these four months Rs. 1,459/- were earned by prison labour, the Irrigation Department employing them at 8 annas each for a 9-hour day’s work under supervision. Two or three are employed as carpenters and have turned out satisfactory worktables, chairs, &amp;c. (iii) Discipline .—This has been good considering the small staff both inside the jail and outside at work. For breaches of discipline the following punishments have been awarded :— Insubordination Refusing to work Interference Attempted bribery - 7 prisoners 5 lashes each. 2 „ 20 1 „ 15 1 „ 7 days’ s.c. 4. Sanitation .—The prison is very clean and the cells are jussed. There has been no outbreak of disease, except for influenza, and the health of prisoners has been generally good. There has been no death in prison. The S.A.S. of the Civil Hospital visits every two days and British M.O. once a week. (i) Latrines .—These are necessarily within the prison and the refuse is disposed of in a domed incinerator 100 yards outside. (ii) Inoculation is being arranged for. Excise .—The only exciseable article is ‘araq. On the expiry of the 1917 contract, an auction was held in March, and the farm of the araq monopoly for Hillah, Hindiyah, Diwaniyah, and Musaiyib was granted for six months at Rs. 2,000/- per month. In September a new contract for manufacture and wholesale vending was given for the same area at Rs. 40,000/— for one year. There are six shops in Hillah town, but none in the district. Four of these are restaurants, the others sell liquor for consumption on the premises. In the early part of the year the licence fees for shops were fixed at Rs. 75/- per six months, though as the shops were not open for the whole period the fee was reduced. Under the present contract the fees are Rs. 125/- for six months. Fees are calculated on the principle that each shop pays a fixed fee of Rs. 50/- for the six months plus 5 per cent, per month of the annual rental, with a minimum of Rs. 125/- for a licence. The rates are low, and the question of raising them is under consideration. Auctions have hitherto been conducted simultaneously in all the districts concerned, as well as in Baghdad—an obviously unsatisfactory arrangement. The best method would be to advertise the auction wherever bidders might be found and hold it in the presence of an A.P.O. at an appointed place on a fixed day.Establishment and Personnel.— The present staff of three British Officers is adequate, and before long I hope to divide the district into sub-divisions, eac under an Assistant A.P.O. The A.P.O. in charge of the district will then be relieved of minor duties, and will be able to turn his attention to more important matters, which it has not hitherto been possible to take up. . As soon as routine can be established, and the staff more adequately trained, a reduction in the number of Shu‘bahs should be possible. The greater the number of Shu‘bahs the larger the volume of work at headquarters, the heavier the expense, and the more difficult the supervision. There is a crying need for trained clerks. Something has been done by the establishment of the Revenue school at Baghdad, but the class of man or boy turned out is not very suitable, except for the headquarters’ office under the eye of the A.P.O. It would, I think, be advisable to import more Indian clerks on temporary agreements in order both to carry on the current work and to train up the local men. With an inexperienced and untrained clerical establishment, the waste of time is incredible. It might be possible to extend the Revenue school to include instruction in office work, and to institute short courses for clerks already employed. The pay of Revenue mamurs is low. A mamur shu‘bah has to incur heavy expenses in entertainment; everyone who comes to his shu‘bah gets coffee, and many of them food for man and horse as well. With falling prices the difficulty will decrease, but I think it would be worth while to pay a war allowance. There is scope for the creation of a class of officials in a position between the A.P.O. and the Mamur Shu‘bah, similar to that of Deputy Collectors in India. Those officers would check Shu‘bah account s, make inspect ions of lands and buildings, and try small cases, and generally supervise and check the work of Mamurs Shu‘bah. The posts might be filled partly by the appointment of Arabs of good family and education, and partly by the promotion of Mamurs Shu‘bah, who have at present no prospects of advancement. I wish to bring to the notice of the Civil Commissioner the names of Shaikhs ‘Addai and Hazza‘, who have rendered valuable services to Government. Shaikh ‘Addai is the leading Shaikh of the district, and has managed a somewhat turbulent tribe with conspicuous success. Shaikh Hazza‘’s tribe were the first to complete payment of their shitwi revenue. Both Shaikhs have readily given every assistance required. Of the townsfolk I would mention Saiyid Muhammad ‘Ali Qazvini and ‘Abdul Razzaq Chalabi. The former is the chief Shi‘ah ‘Alim. He has always shown himself ready to assist, and to exert his very considerable influence on behalf of the British Administration. ‘Abdul Razzaq Chalabi is a wealthy merchant and holds the office of Rais Baladiyah. He has shown untiring energy in the affairs of the town, and in all matters it is always possible to count on his loyal co-operation. Among the district staff, Ibrahim Eff., formerly head clerk, was promoted to be Vernacular Assistant as a reward for good work. His duties have been heavy, and he has always discharged them ably and cheerfully. Sadhu Ram, formerly Accountant, has recently undertaken in addition the work of Head Clerk. In both capacities he has worked hard and entirely to my satisfaction, and has proved himself competent and reliable. Emile Bazawi Eff., Head Revenue Clerk, on whom has fallen the bulk of the heavy Revenue work, has shown considerable ability and possesses a very good knowledge of the details of Revenue work. L. S.

Office of the Assistant Political Officer, Hillah, January, 1919. Agricultural Compensation, Hillah Area, 1918. A. General. —1. No land was acquired until February, when the crops were well advanced, so that the fairest method of compensation was to pay on the estimated value of the crop less revenue. No deductions were made on account of possible loss from hail, rain, or locusts, or for lessened expense for labour. The method employed was to ascertain the area under each kind of crop by pacing or eye, and to apply to that figure, first, the estimated outturn of that kind of crop and, second, the estimated selling price of the grain or vegetable in question. The estimate of outturn was modified according as the crop was good, bad, or indifferent, the standard taken in all cases being that of a good average crop. Thus barley was estimated at Rs. 100/- per ton selling price, and the outturn per acre was estimated at 800 kilos. Hence the gross value of a standard crop on one acre would be 80/-. 2. The difficulty of this system is to ascertain with reasonable accuracy either the outturn per acre or the selling price. The method employed was to collect opinions from officials, cultivators, landowners, etc., and so to arrive at a working arrangement. The standards finally settled are given as an Appendix to this note, but they will certainly need modification. It is hopeless to expect accuracy till prices settle down.3. The fact that the ejected landowners or fallahs, being freed from cultivation, might work elsewhere has been ignored. In many cases their position or age debars them from working as coolies, and in others they have other cultivation, whether palms which are not acquired, or different plots which require attention and prevent their seeking fresh employment. 4. It will general!}^ be found, especially in the case of gardens, that several people have an interest in the same plot of ground. In this district agricultural land falls under the headings miri, tapu, mudawarah, mahlul, and waqf, and the distribution of the crop varies accordingly. In gardens the share of mallak and fallah varies from garden to garden, and it is necessary to make separate enquiries in each case. Generally, the fallah gets all the ground crops and a proportion of the fruit and dates. It is advisable in the case of both gardens and agricultural land to pay the sarkal all the fallah’s share of compensation, and let them share out among themselves. 5. If assessments are made soon after sowing it might be fairer to assess in the value of the seed plus the value of the labour expended; but in such case it will be necessary not to lose sight of the considerations mentioned in paragraph 3 . 6 . Hitherto compensation has been paid only on the value of the crop destroyed. This method is obviously unfair when the cultivator is to be kept off his land for more than one harvest, and the question is being referred to Baghdad. It will probably be found that the best solution is to assess an annual rent. 7. Revenue due is deducted from the value of a crop. On agricultural land the revenue varies according to the class of land. The only other revenue that need be regarded is the vegetable tax of 20 per cent, on green and on most dry vegetables. 8 . It frequently happens that the acquisition of a piece of ground injures the cultivation of another by interfering with the irrigation. Sometimes it is possible to procure a pipe and lay it under a railway or road that crosses or blocks a channel, and sometimes arrangements can be made with the owner of a neighbouring canal for the supply of water. If no such arrangement is practicable there is nothing for it but to pay compensation. 9. In the interest of economy, where possible, acquisition should be delayed to enable a crop to be reaped. * B. Miscellaneous. —1. A karad is worth, roughly, 50/-. 2. Large bricks are worth 30/- per 1,000, and small bricks 20/- per 1,000; labour about 10/- and 12/- respectively for brickAvork on a well. 3.

Palm-trees. —Compensation is payable on the following scale :— 20 years and upwards - - - - - 15-20 - - - - - - - 12-15 10-12 - - - Small trees ------- Rs. 20 /- 15/- 12 /- 10 /- 5/- The above scale is low and does not fairly represent the capitalised value of the dates. The trees when felled are the property of the original owner and not of Government. It is undesirable that Government should acquire the trees by assessment of their value. If the OAvner sells in open market neither he nor Government suffers. If the trees are acquired, the only fair way of assessing their value is to measure each, and the A.P.O. has no time for that, because such acquisition involves the measurement of each trunk. It is better to leave the trees to the Arab and let him sell them to whom soever he will. Should it be necessary to acquire timber, Re. 1 per linear foot is a fairly accurate flat rate. Nothing should be paid for small palms that can be transplanted. Compensation for Crops. 2,.—Crops. Crop. Yield per acre. Selling price per waznah. Return per acre.

L 4Note on Rent Compensation for Land. I. Classes of Land .—Land acquired falls generally into one or two classes, agricultural land, i.e., the ordinary miri or tapu, and raugharisji land, i.e., gardens and palm-groves held on special tenures, and each class must be treated separately. This note does not consider the value of crops or trees on the ground at the time of acquisition. A. Agricultural Land .—For miri no compensation need be paid since no one has any right other than that of a tenant-at-will. For tapu land only the mallak need be compensated. As the mallak is supposed to spend half his 40 per cent, share on canals, etc., and to pay about 5 per cent, of the whole crop to the Sarkal, his net profit, which forms the basis of compensation, may be taken to be 17 per cent, of the gross crop. The gross annual value of the crops on agricultural land may be taken to be about Rs. 125/- per acre, assuming it would be sown with wheat and barley in the proportion of 1 to 3, and taking the value of wheat to be Rs. 200/- and barley Rs. 100/- per ton. This calculation takes no account of fallow. In view of the small area taken up in proportion to the size of a muqata‘ah, it is doubtful whether any compensation should be paid for land other than gardens acquired for a railway, except where station or sidings are concerned. Land on which vegetables are generally cultivated needs special consideration. Rs. 200/- per acre would be a fair flat rate of valuation of the annual profit. B. Mugharisji Land .—See note on this class of land. The principal point to remember is that the relation of mallak and fallah is a relation of partners rathcy than of landlord and tenant. Each has a share, which varies to an infinite extent, and it is necessary in the first instance to determine the share of each in each kind of crop. There are generally several mallaks and several fallahs, and the proportion due to each must next be decided. The produce of gardens ordinarily consists in dates, wheat and barley, vegetables and fruit. For the last 1/- per annum would be a fair estimate of profit. Wheat, barley and vegetables are dealt with above and in my note on compensation generally. The value of dates depends largely on the variety. There is no information in the office on this subject at present. Information is needed as to the yield of each variety and the value thereof. The most common practice is to grow vegetables and fruit under the palms and wheat, and barley outside; but it is impossible to dogmatise as to what crops would be had the land not been acquired, and each case must be settled on its merits. II. Determination of Rent.—As a general principle, the amount of rent assessed should be equivalent to the profit that would have accrued had the land not been acquired. This principle takes no heed of the saving of the owner’s labour, and therefore a reduction should be made if the owner is able to direct his energies elsewhere. To a mallak, whether if tapu or mugharisji land, who does not labour himself, acquisition means a dead loss, except for some saving in the cost of management. A Fallah of Mugharisji, also, is not a mere labourer; if ejected, he loses his dates, and cannot find a ready-made garden elsewhere, though he can earn a reduced income as a labourer. It will therefore be necessary to estimate his net loss. Sometimes the acquisition is such as to admit of partial cultivation, e.g., when the ground is taken up, but the cultivator is allowed access to his palms, and in such cases he is tied down to the land in question and cannot go away to work elsewhere. On the other hand, his profits are reduced by the occupation of the ground, and frequently by interference with irrigation. In determining either rent or compensation for damage the assessing officer should always come to clear understanding with the unit or department taking over the land, as to the extent to which the land is required. This is especially important in places where questions of irrigation are involved. For example, if a man is to be debarred from irrigating his date-trees, he must be compensated therefor. It should generally be possible to arrange facilities for irrigation, but when they are denied the fact should always be stated in the award for the information of the G.O.C. In all cases the officer taking over the land should be required to state in writing exactly what he requires and to what extent he wishes to debar Arabs from access to the land, or to close irrigation channels, etc. It some times happens that the closing of a channel injures land other than that actually taken over, and in such case the owner of the former is entitled to compensation. If roads, irrigation cuts, etc., are interfered with, it is for the officer taking over the land to see that arrangements, such as the construction of culverts, are made. If he is unable to do this, the resulting loss to the cultivators must be assessed, and the officer should be asked to state his inability in writing. It is then for the G.O.C. to decide whether he will insist that arrangements be made or sanction the additional compensation. APPENDIX C. Revenue Circular No. 2. Shu‘bah Accounts 1. Registers .—The Ma'mur shu‘bah will maintain the following registers (1) Cash book. (2) Grain book. (3) Ledger for each tax. (4) Tax register. The cash book and grain book have been explained in Revenue Circular No. 1 , which also explains the ledger so far as Land Revenue is concerned. ’ 1 Ledger. Ledgers for other taxes will be maintained in the same manner. There will be one ledger for each tax, with two double pages for each person liable to pay that tax. On the right hand side will be entered the demand as soon as it is known, and on the left the collections as they are made.Tax Register. The tax register shows the demand and collections on account of each tax for the Shu bah as a whole. It will be in H.R. 2, with the demand entered in red ink above each tax. Except by order of the P.O., the demand will never be altered. The names of taxes are entered horizontally, and the items of payment vertically. The total of each column will be entered at the foot, and carried over to the next page. The registers will be written up from the cash book daily, and will be totalled in red ink at the end of the month. Each item in the cash book will be entered separately. A copy of the tax register for the month to date will be sent to the Mudir Mai when cash is remitted. 2. Payment of Cash at *S7m‘6aA.—Tins has been explained in Revenue Circular No. 1 c. Receipts for other taxes than Land Revenue will be made out on the old Turkish forms till new books are supplied. 3. Remittances to Hillah. —On the 8 th, loth, 22nd and 29th of each month the Mamur will send the whole of his cash, whatever the amount, to the Mudir Mai, accompanied by a copy of the tax register and a statement in H.R. 3, showing on what accounts it has been collected. The statement will be made out in duplicate, one copy being retained by the Mamur. It will have a serial number, which will be entered in column 9 of the cash book. 4. Book Entries.—'When, cash payments on account of any tax are made at Hillah, the Mudir Mai will send the vouchers every Saturday to the shu‘bah concerned. The Mamur will acknowledge the receipt of the vouchers, and from them he will post his ledgers. At the same time he will enter each item in red ink on the right side and the total on the left side of his cash book. This is necessary in order to make cash book, ledgers and tax registers agree; but as the actual cash is not paid at the shu £ bah, a double entry must be made in the cash book to ensure agreement with the actual cash balance. See also R.C. 1 , para. c. 5. Collections on Tour. —When on tour the Mamur will take with him scroll cash book and a book of receipts with counterfoil. If he collects any tax he will at once make an entry in the cash book showing the name of payee, the date, the amount, and the tax on account of which the money was collected and will give a receipt noting details on counterfoil. Immediately on his return to his shu‘bah he will write up the ledgers and shu'bah cash book and pay the money into the cash balance. 6 . Alterations. —If a figure is wrongly written, the correct figure is not to be written over the old one. The old figure must be neatly crossed out and the new figure written above. 7. Closure of Accounts. —All accounts will be closed on the 29th of the month, subsequent entries being dated the 1 st of the following month. 8 . Inspection. —The Mamur shu £ bah will periodically check his registers, initialling each item checked and found correct. (Signed) C. F. Macpherson, Major, Political Officer, Hillah. H.R. 1.

Shu‘bah Mamur, Revenue Circular No. 3. Revenue Accounts H.Q. : 1. Registers. —The Mudir Mai is responsible for the H.Q. Revenue accounts. In his absence, the Head Revenue clerk will take his place. The following registers will be maintained— (1) Cash book. (2) Grain book. (3) Tax register. Cash Book (R.F. 7).—The cash book will be written up each time a transaction occurs, and all transactions will be entered in it. A serial number will be given to each entry, the number of the month being written as denominator. In column 4 will be entered the number of the voucher. Column 5 gives the reference to the tax register. The cash book will be totalled daily in red ink.158 Grain Book (R.F. 6 ).—The grain book will be written up every Monday morning from the returns submitted by the Mamurs shu‘bah. In form it will be the same as the ambar grain book 6 ), and only the shu £ bah totals will be entered. When allshu &lt; bah returns have been received the book will be totalled and the total carried over to the next page. The Mudir Mai must be careful to include in the proper shu £ bah total all grain received on account of that shu'bah at the two Hillah granaries. (See also Circular No. 1, para. B. 2.) 1. Tax Register (H.R. 2).—The tax register shows the total collection to date of each kind of tax. The names of the taxes are written horizontally, and the accounts received, whether at Hillah or a shu‘bah, are entered vertically. For payments at Hillah the register is written up at the end of the day from the vouchers (M.A.F. 23) or the cash book, receipts on account of any one tax for the same shu £ bah being grouped together. Payments made at the shu £ bah are entered four times a month from the Mamur’s returns (H.R. 3). At the head of each page, under the name of the tax, will be entered in red ink the total demand, outstandings and current demand being shown separately and added together. The total demand will not be altered except by order of the Political Officer, and is unaffected by receipts. 2. Payments at Hillah. —No money will be handled by the Revenue officer, and so there will be no entries on the debit side of the cash book. When any one, whether a private person or a tahsildar, comes to pay revenue, the revenue accountant will make out a voucher (M.A.F. 23) in quadruplicate, and enter the transaction in the cash book and tax register. The voucher will be signed by the Mudir Mai. A Qawas will then take the payer with his money and all four vouchers to the Treasury Officer, who will receive the money, receipt and return one voucher to the payer, and retain another. The Qawas will bring back the other two vouchers to the Mudir Mai, who will retain one for record, and send the other to the shu £ bah concerned on the following Saturday, together with all other vouchers for that shu‘bah. With the vouchers will be sent a covering letter (H.R. 1) showing the numbers of the vouchers sent, the taxes on account of which the money has been paid, and the amount received on account of each tax. The acknowledgement of the Mamur will be filed by the Mudir Mai. A separate book of vouchers will be kept for each shu‘bah, and vouchers will be numbered serially, a distinctive letter being used for each shu £ bah. From the vouchers the shu‘bah registers are posted. 3. Remittances to Hillah. —On the 8 th, 15th, 22nd and 29th of each month the Mamur shu £ bah remits his entire cash balance, whatever the amount, to the Mudir Mai. This remittance is accom panied by a statement (H.R. 3) showing the revenue received since the last remittance and the heads under which the cash sent is to be credited. The Accountant will then write up first his cash book and then his tax register. The cash will be counted, compared with the total of the statement, and sent to the Treasury Officer in the manner laid down in para. 2. With the cash a copy of the tax register is sent to the Mudir Mai, who will check it by his own tax register and cash book, and compare it with the Treasury’s Officer’s tax register and cash book. 4. Inspection. —The Mudir Mai will periodically check his register, initialling each item checked and found correct. H.R. 1. To Mamur The enclosed vouchers No to No showing payments of Rs made in Hillah on account of your shu'bah are forwarded for adjustment of those items in your registers. Please acknowledge receipt.

Shu‘bah, Mamur,APPENDIX D. Note on Mugharisji Holdings, Hillah District. Revenue Administration Report, Chapter V.B. 4 . 1. Origin .—Mugharisji rights normally originate in the device to cultivate dates, which are more profitable than ground crops. The fallah is assigned a plot of land by the tapu owner, or, in the case of miri land, by the Government, on certain conditions, one of which is always the obligation to plant the land with date palms. In some cases the fallah claims to have bought the land outright from Government. In other cases it is alleged that he has squatted on the land without the leave of either tapu owner or Government, and in such cases he claims that, though he has no sanad, he has acquired Mugharisji rights in virtue of undisturbed possession. Both fallah and mallak should have documents, but generally they have not, and when documents are produced they are generally so vague, especially as regards boundaries, as to be useless; Government records have disappeared. 2. Nature .—The evidence as to the nature of mugharisji rights is so conflicting that it is impossible to define them with exactitude. The essence of the arrangement is that fallah and mallak stand rather in the relation of partners than in that of landlord and tenant. Each gets a share of the produce; I have never come across an instance of a cash rent. The point in issue between them is how much each is entitled to receive. I think there is no doubt that as long as the date-trees remain and the fallah continues to cultivate the land, he can never be ejected. Mr. Ezra Daniel has admitted this to me. Cases of sale of fallahs’ right and claims thereto by inheritance have been numerous, and I have never heard it denied that the fallah’s right is heritable and transferable. It is, however, uncertain when these qualities accrue to the right. In some leases it is provided that the fallah becomes a mallak, i.e., a full partner, after a term of years; but I think he can sell or bequeathe his prospective right at any time, the conditions of the original lease still holding good as against the purchaser or inheriter. I have never had to eject a fallah, but I am informed by Mr. Ezra Daniel that even in case of ejectment for good reason, the sharah law allows compensation, despite any provision in the lease to the contrary. Sometimes a fallah will put in a man to cultivate for him, the two dividing the share due to the fallah. A fallah on miri land often calls himself “ mallak-fallah,” and claims that he is liable to pay to Government only the date-tree tax. It is probable that these claims are false, but I think it is at present inadvisable to try to collect a share of the crops, or to investigate the claims. 3. Suits .—Suits fall into three classes: those between mallak and mallak, those between fallah and fallah, and those between mallak and fallah, of which the last are by far the most common. The two former generally turn on a question of inheritance or sale, and are ordinarily best referred to a civil court. The latter almost invariably resolve themselves into suits for profits. In hearing them I have found that the only possible principle to act on is that of possession. The claimant must show that he is, or has recently been, in actual possession of the share he claims. The original petition is almost always presented by the fallah, who complains that the mallak is trying to recover from him a share to which he is not entitled. The burden of proof should always be thrown on the mallak; he should have a sanad from the fallahs, and if he has not he must prove possession by oral evidence. No order passed by an A.B.O. should deal with title; he is concerned only with the necessity for distributing the produce, though, as a matter of convenience and to prevent annual dispute, it is, I think, best to direct that the distribution made shall hold good in future years pending the inevitable settlement. Claims to profits are generally disputed on one of two grounds. Either the fallah denies the mallak’s title altogether, or, more commonly, he admits his claim to a certain proportion only. Usually the fallah is willing to share the dates, but insists that the ground crops are his own. Cases of this sort exhibit an infinite variety. Sometimes the mallak claims a proportion of all produce, sometimes he admits that crops under the date palms belong exclusively to the fallah, but demands his share from the “ tala‘,” or area not actually under dates. In other words, his contention is that he leased the land for the purpose of planting a grove, that as the fallah is diligent in planting palms, so does his ground crop area increase, the mallak getting his profit from the increasing output of dates. The fallah contends that he received the land as a whole on the understanding that he was to get all the ground crops in return for his trouble in planting the date-trees, the mallak being adequately provided for bv the conversion of wheat land into grove. Mr. Daniel informs me that this is sometimes the case. In some cases, besides the garden, and the land that will soon be converted into garden, the fallah also cultivates a large area under wheat and barley. I do not think he can fairly claim to pay no share from this to the mallak. A properly drawn lease would solve most of these difficulties, but such is seldom forthcoming. As a rough rule, I think it best to bear in mind that the mallak is almost certainly getting more now than he has ever got before, and to insist that he, who in most countries would be the complainant, should bear the burden of proof. 4. Earms.—Farms of a share, especially a mallak’s share, are very common; indeed there is one professional farmer. Some of them are given for perfectly good reasons, as, for instance, when the mallak is resident elsewhere or when the mallaks are numerous. In many cases, however, the grant of a farm is really an attempt to bolster up a rickety title, or to realise any small amount on a doubtful claim, and sometimes it approaches actual fraud. Unless good reason is shown, it may safely be presumed that the mallak who gives a farm has never been able to collect the amount he states to be his due, and this fact tells against his claim to possession. If he finds it necessary to farm his rights now, one may be sure that he never got as much in Turkish times as the present consideration. The other common case is that of a mallak who leases the other mallak s shares. Sometimes he does this bona fide, because he is the only sharer on the spot; sometimes he does it in order to assert his160 claims against the other mallaks. There have been several cases in which different mallaks have leased the same right to different farmers. In such an impossible situation, or where justice clearly demands it, I have no hesitation in setting aside any farms, compensating the farmer if necessary, and settling the matter de novo , L. S. L. Dacres, Captain, Assistant Political Officer, Hillah. Revenue Cases.—The distinction between revenue and civil cases is sometimes fine, but I think that for the present a revenue case might be defined as a case relating to agricultural land, which should be held to include groves and gardens. I regard it as essential that all matters regarding such land should be under the control of political officers, and that the jurisdiction of civil courts should be absolutely barred. Rights in water, the distribution of the crop between the State, mallak, sarkal, shaikh and fallah, and the clearance of canals, are obvious examples of cases which should be kept under the control of the district officer who is closely in touch with such matters. Similarly, there are various problems, such as the extent to which tapu rights are to be recognised, the treatment of ‘uqr, and the enforcement of mallaks’ claims, which are not yet ripe for decision. All these questions are bound up with the administration of a district. They can only be decided finally by legislation or settlement, which cannot be put into effect till after the war. The most that can be done now is to lay down general rules and to decide each case on its merits. Law and usage are so frequently at variance in these matters that they are better dealt with summarily and temporarily by the district officer. The order of a civil court, specially if vindicated by a successful appeal, both leads the litigant to believe that his case has been decided for good, and creates precedents which may well be contrary to a subsequently decided policy. Future action after the war will be prejudiced, and the Government left to choose between the adoption of an undesirable policy and the wholesale reversal of judicial decrees. It is for these reasons that I do not agree with the view given in paragraph 3 of the preface to the Peace Courts’ Law. The illustration given, that of the two claimants to a tapu property, ignores the possibility that effective possession may have been held by neither, but by a tribe. A decree would issue regardless of tribal claims, and the decision would hamper the operations of a subsequent settlement; the tribe, even if represented, would be implicated in civil litigation, from which it is most desirable that the backward peoples should be delivered. The decision of a political officer is frankly temporary, and is recognised as such, and it can be cancelled at any time by executive order. Except for a few tapu and mulk owners, those interested in land are generally a backward and ill-educated people, to whom a simple procedure with a minimum of appeal is better suited than the slower and more expensive, if more accurate, methods of a civil court. I consider it should be clearly laid down from the beginning that matters affecting land are to be in the hands of revenue officers. It is always easier to extend than to curtail the powers of a court. Many of the matters in question are complicated by executive considerations, a fact which gives additional force to the system proposed. For these reasons I would retain all cases affecting land under the control of the P.0, or A.P.O., while empowering them to transfer cases as requisite to the Judicial Officer. APPENDIX F.

Prisoners of War Dependents .—In February last the payments made to the dependents of prisoners of war were most irregular, owing to the more urgent work of political officers. Many families had received nothing for months. On the opening of the A.P.O. town office in the Baladiyah the matter was fully gone into and organised, and relief came just in time. Compassionate allowance at the rate of Rs. 4/- a head per mensem has been allowed to the various members of a family. This has been fair allowance, but of course it cannot support a totally destitute person, the living rate being about Rs. 15/- per mensem. The balance has been made up, no doubt, from charitable and other sources. In a few cases, where the position of the prisoners has made it necessary, when he has belonged to the officer class, a slightly larger allowance has been paid. The unravelling of the approximate truth as regards these payments—there are over 160 families—has taken a great deal of time and correspondence. Mukhtars in each case have to vouch for the validity of the claims as far as they can, and are responsible under penalty to inform one of any necessary changes in the allowance due to marriage, death or change of district. The people have been paid monthly as far as possible. They are very grateful for the relief. Most of the prisoners appear to have been originally conscripted, and to have taken part in the actions fought against us at Shffiaibah and Nas'iriyah. A few have had experience of the Erzerum campaign, and two men in Hillah have lost their fingers from frostbite in the war against Russia. The far greater majority of the prisoners are interned at Samarpur, a prisoners’ camp I had been all over in August, 1916. The present monthly payment comes to Rs. 1,720/-. Former Turkish Pensioners .—These have been given subsistence allowance only and some have been refused any payment on the grounds that they are able to support themselves. This granting of a subsistence allowance appears to be a fair charge in wartime, but, the war at an end, the question arises as to the advisibility of granting such people a proper pension, a point I would call attention to. Such pensions would be, in most cases, a fair charge on the country. If a generous pension is not allowed, then a subsistence allowance as at present will surely be continued. The number of people receiving S.A. under this head came to 54. The original allowances have been recently modified, and in most cases a slight increase allowed in view of high prices and the class of pensioner in question. Many are women of good family and cannot support themselves, if not in receipt of other assistance, on less thanRs. 15/- p. m.—a bare living wage, which does not take such questions as housing and clothing into account even. Mukhtars are responsible for all statements they make with regard to these pensioners, and their reports have been checked by police enquiries and a confidential report from the Rais el Baladiyah, whom I have always found very open-minded and fair in such cases. He has in some instances recommended deductions I would not allow. The monthly (revised) payment totals Rs. 782/8/-. APPENDIX H. Number. Amount. Rs. Prisoners of War - - - - 163 1,720 per per mensem. Former Turkish Pensioners ~ ' ' 55 782/8/- APPENDIX I. Billets. Billets were taken in a haphazard manner at first. Local Resources won easily and took over rather more than they actually needed. Subsequently these spare buildings were given to other departments. In view of the ruined state of all public buildings and most private ones, much inconvenience was caused, and it took many months to clean up the place generally and to settle down. Captain Truelove, of the Irrigation department, has practically rebuilt the area we occupy and has completed a trans formation under labour difficulties both “ pucka ” and pleasing to the eye. Payment of the rents of the billets taken by Government has been much delayed. Rents have been assessed at pre-war rates and are generally very low indeed, houses of value, say of Rs. 9,500/—, being rented at Rs. 20/- per mensem. It is presumed that people did not invest in house property and built for their own use only. As four out of the seven mahallahs of the city had been systematically destroyed by the Turks, house accommodation has been difficult to find and the influx of officials and others from Baghdad has resulted in a rise of rents generally. I have restricted the rise in rent of shops and houses to 33 J per cent, temporarily, but there is little doubt that it has been evaded by false lease and other means in some cases. Hillah contains a number of large corn sifs, buildings specialised for the storing of grain; most of the larger ones have been taken by Government for various purposes, and it would be advisable, perhaps, to leave the remaining ones for the people. As low pre-war rents are being paid and the improvements we make to buildings taken over are seldom improvements from the Arab owner’s point of view, reductions for rebuilding, etc., will be162 / ' only necessary in a few instances. A man who has a large com sif fails to see any improvement in his sif when it is converted into a jail, nor does the woman who owns and lives in a tumbled down house appreciate its conversion into a kitchen, however “ pukka, ’ for the officers rest house. I have always given owners as much warning as possible, but in many cases it has been necessary to evict quickly. Disturbance claims have never been made and when offered have been refused, owners in all cases giving up their buildings with good grace, except in one case, an agent of Resources, who had only a tenancy himself of the required house. When building material arrives and labour is released for civil purposes, it is hoped that the prosperity of the people will manifest itself in new buildings and every encouragement should be given them to this end.

I. Political and Tribal. —I. Since the last Administration report the area of the district has received a considerable addition, namely, the Mahmudiyah shubah of the Turkish district of Kadhimain, which was bounded on the north by the line of the old Yusufiyah Canal; this shu‘bah in turn has been enlarged by the addition of the greater part of the Radhwaniyah estate and by a portion of the British Baghdad district. The northern boundary of the district, instead of being as before the Latifiyah canal, is now a line from ImamHamzah (6 miles above Mufraz) along the Radhwaniyah canal to the building known as Kashuk; thence along the old Decauville track to Tall Aswad; from Tall Aswad East to the Baghdad-Hillah road, which is followed till it crosses the old Yusufiyah at Khan ‘Azad; thence the Yusufiyah Argub ” is the boundary to the Tigris near Ctesiphon. Turning South the boundary follows the Tigris down the Saiyafiyah reach to the boundary of Huriyah, where it leaves the river and takes an undefined line through the Jazirah to the tails of the Nasiriyah and Mahawil canals. The southern boundary is the Mahawil and Khawas shu'bahs of the Hillah district. The southern boundary strikes the Euphrates about 2 miles upstream of the Barrage, thence to the mouth of the Husainiyah canal. The Husainiyah is followed for some 4 miles. Thence the boundary follows the western limit of the Wand estate to about 3 miles East of Imam ‘Aun on the Musaiyib Karbala road. The western boundary may be taken as a straight line from that point to a point opposite Imam Hamzah at the head of the New Mahmudiyah Canal. The accretions mentioned above have practically doubled the cultivable area of the district. II. Tribal distribution in the district as it stands is as follows :— A. Tribes of Zubaid Origin. — (a) Juhaish—a small number of this tribe cultivate for Shaikh Faisal at the tails of the Musaiyib and Nasiriyah canals; they are all his personal adherents and fallahs. The following small sections cultivating near Iskandariyah Khan are also reckoned with the Juhaish, but are of various origin : Albu Badran, Shuwafah and Tarabiyin. (b) Qaraghul live between the head of the Iskandariyah and the head of the Mahmudiyah and cultivate most of the karads in the vicinity. They have always been noted for obedience to Government orders and have given us much help in excavating canals and policing the river. Their headman is Shallal al Salih, who succeeded his brother Khudhan when the latter was murdered by one of the Nawabit (Zoba‘) in November 1917. The blood-money was assessed by the Hillah majlis this summer and half has been paid up. (c) Albu Mufarraj, an obscure section, but probably of Zubaid origin. They have now migrated to karads on the Yusufiyah from their original land near the head of the Mahmudiyah, which was very badly situated. (d) Albu ‘Amir. A few of this tribe previously cultivated between the Barrage and Musaiyib, but a stronger detachment has now arrived from the Hillah district and been planted on the Yusifiyah near Tall al Dair. (e) Albu Mahi, like the Albu ‘Amir, are a professional cultivating tribe and have moved from Muhannawiyah in Hillah to the Yusufiyah. (/) Janabiyin. A numerous tribe occupying the whole of the right bank of the Euphrates from opposite the old Mahmudiyah down to Musaiyib. A few of them, including the Shaikh Rashid al ‘Ali, live on the left bank at the head of the Iskandar iyah. The tribe was very troublesome last year as they were very favourably situated for exporting grain and coffee to the Turks. They on several occasions attacked Government officials. The expedition in January of this year against Ubaiyid ibn Hah ash made some improvement. In the spring I made all their leading men undertake to obey Shaikh Rashid al ‘Ali, who is our very good friend, but up to that time had no influence West of the Euphrates. Since this event, and the deportation of another Janabiyin notable on suspicion of harbouring enemy agents, Rashid has been in effective control of his tribe, and there is no better behaved area in the district. The tribe turned up in force to help excavate the Yusufiyah and did excellent work, though the Yusufiyah does not benefit them.164 B. Tribes of Bhammar Origin. — {a) Zoba c —this large tribe is represented in the district by two sections only:— (i) The Fadaghah, who &lt; formerly cultivated near the head of the old Mahmudiyah and have now moved into the new area north of the Yusufiyah and have been given the Bir A1 Hammam lands. The A.P.O. deals with them through Suhail al Mahawish, the representative of the leading family, but he is not much of a success. (ii) Chadahah, who have moved in this autumn from the Radhwaniyah to take up the Qutaimah land on the Yusufiyah. They brought with them a small section of the ‘Azzah (Zubaid) originally hailing from the Diyalah). The head of the Chadadah is Dharb al Sulaiman, but he is not very effective. Both sections remain under the ultimate authority of Dhari al Dhahir, but for purposes of ordinary work are dealt with direct. (b) Ghurair. The whole of the old Mahmudiyah is now a Ghurair area. Their Shaikh, Muhammad al Dulaimi, has been put in charge also of the sections of tribes other than Zoba‘ cultivating in the recently developed area on the Yusufiyah, but it is understood that only in extreme cases, such as intersectional quarrels and raids on the road, will he have anything to do with the Albu Mahi and Albu ‘Amir. (c) Mas‘ud. Sections of this tribe live in Hor Husain, Wand, and on the tail of the Iskandariyah, and are also found as cultivators in gardens and karads round Musaiyib. They are supposed to be under the paramount authority of ‘Abdul Muhsin, who lives in Karbala. In point of fact the Iskandariyah people are always dealt with separately. {d) Shamamrah, consist of a number of small disunited sections who occupy the Nasiriyah canal. In old days they were supposed to acknowledge Faisal’s authority, but Faisal is so inefficient and so unpopular that it is impossible to make use of him, and the situation is practically non-tribal. C. Tribes of Dulaim Origin. — {a) Qartan, a peaceful cultivating section who are scattered up and down the Mahmudiyah shu‘bah. There is a solid block between Imam Hamzah and Mufraz, but they have no single head. The others were fallahs of other tribes or petty sarkals, but have now been collected and planted out on the Hor Abu Qutun south of Tall Aswad in the new Yusufiyah area. (6) Albu Tsa—a few of these have strayed into the Jurf as Sakhr karads from the Falujah district. * (c) A miscellaneous collection of Dulaim, many of whom were fallahs of the Ghurair or worked with the Jubur or anywhere else where they could get a living, have been collected and placed on the new Yusufiyah in the area immediately North-West of Khan ‘Azad. III. There have during the year been only three incidents of any importance in tribal affairs. They are :— (i) The restoration to Shaikh Rashid al ‘Ali of his lost hereditary influence over the Janabiyin. (ii) The settlement by the Hillah majlis (‘Addai, Faisal, and Hazza‘) of the feud between the Nawabit Fadaghah and the Qaraghul caused by the murder of Shaikh Khudhair al Salih of the latter tribe by one of the former. (hi) The recent arrangement by which Nasir ibn Faisal of the Juhaish is directly responsible in everyday matters to the A.P.O. Musaiyib for Al Juhaish in the Musaiyib district. Faisal now concentrates on the' herculean task of looking after the Hillah Juhaish. IV. As regards the town, Musaiyib amply maintains its reputation for lying, scandal and false rumours. This was notorious in Turkish times. ‘Anah and Samarra were reputed to be a very bad second and third to Musaiyib in this respect. Musaiyib and the Musaiyib shiffbah west of the Bhagdad-Hillah road supply the A.P.O. with 99 per cent, of his work, as far as petitions and squabbles go. Serious politics, there are practically none. At the time of the Najaf disturbances in the spring, the town appeared far more interested in speculating whether the fortification of the Musaiyib bridge head portended the retaking of Ramadi bv the Turks. ° J2. Revenue : (a) Land Revenue .— I. For revenue purposes the district is divided into four shubahs : Musaiyib, Iskandariyah, Mahmudiyah and the Jurf al Sakhr. For the greater part of the year, district headquarters was staffed by a mudir mal and two clerks. The mudir mal having been convicted of complicity in an attempt to sell Government grain was imprisoned and dismissed. He has not been replaced, and it is very doubtful whether, given reasonably efficient mamurs shubah and a good head revenue clerk, a mudir mal is necessary. II. The Musaiyib shu‘bah consists of the areas served by the Musaiyib, Nasiriyah and ‘Ajaimi canals (Government property) and of the Abu Lokah tapu estate and the annexed lift cultivation. For administration purposes it includes the Naqib’s waqf property (Qadiriyah), which pays no revenue. It is a large slnTbah and the collection and management of the various miscellaneous taxes collected in Musaiyib town devolves on the mamur. An assistant mamur has been sanctioned. Iskandariyah consists only of the land irrigated from the Iskandariyah canal and annexed karads; it is a light charge. All land is Government property. Mahmudiyah was even before the existence of the new canal a big slnTbah, the flow land, amounting to some 10,000 acres of cultivation in any year, and the baqrahs in the lift area numbering about 200. The estimated cultivated acreage in the Mahmudiyah area this year is some 20,000 acres and two mamurs will be necessary. Two mamurs were originally sanctioned, but one was found to suffice. It is not proposed to divide the area into two shu‘bahs. I consider that it is better to keep our revenue areas large on the ground both of economy and efficiency, adding assistant mamurs where found necessary: the mamur and his clerk in a slnTbah like Iskandariyah are, in my opinion, underworked, except at certain times of the year. But before drastic changes can be made it is necessary to arrive at some better method of assessing revenue. The whole of the Mahmudiyah shu‘bah is Government property. The Jurf al Sakhr is a large area, extending as it does from Wand to Sakhariyah near Imam Hamzah, but it is a definitely tribal area and all tapu land, and therefore depends very much less on Government administration than do shu‘bahs where the land is mostly sanniyah. So far it has been staffed by a mamur and his assistant, but it is proposed to abolish the post of assistant. On conclusion of harvest operations this year all granary staffs, permanent or temporary, are being brought under reduction. III. The total charges for establishment during the year were Rs, 44,000/-. Total demands issued, all of which will shortly be collected, are shown in the annexed statement. IV. I attach as Appendix B. to this section copies of my 1,318 of 26th August to P.O., Hillah, and extract copy of paras. 1-4, of my 1,755, of 15th November, to P.O., Hillah. These explain sufficiently methods of assessment and collection adopted. I would only add that the assessments on the Mahmudiyah and Iskandariyah karads are in cash at a rate fixed in Turkish times and very low. It is proposed to revise them. V. As regards saifi, the assessments of the estimating committees were, under instructions from Hillah, accepted, although it was clear that in many cases they were well below the mark. Nevertheless there is little doubt that the shitwi assessments were full, and represented a considerably greater share of the produce than the cultivator had ever been used to hand over to Government. VI. The vegetable tax, instead of being collected in the market on vegetables sold was assessed on a new plan, an account of which will be found in the correspon dence attached as Appendix C. A.P.O., Musaiyib’s 605 of 15th April 1918; para. 1 of 724 of 10th May 1918; 1,456 of 20th September 1918; F.R.O.s 13,033; Note to P.O., Hillah, on working of tax. It cannot be claimed that the device was a complete success, and it certainly gave rise to an incredible number of petitions. But I am of opinion that both the want of success and the numerous petitions were due to the unfamiliarity both of and of the people with the plan adopted. But as long as we continue to collect vegetable tax on the Turkish method, i.e., in the market, we must either consent to be robbed or to put the tax on iltizam.166 VII. As regards the future of land revenue in the district, I think everything points to early arrangements for a fixed cash assessment, for which the district is eminently suited. Something might be done in 1919 by taking to sarkals as soon as we see what the character of the harvest is likely to be, and fixing on each sarkaFs holding a suitable quantity of grain per faddan. We could describe it as a form of iltizam. This will require detailed crop inspections and classification of holdings as good, bad and indifferent. It is only a temporary solution, but it would give us an indication as to what each holding can pay, on the basis of which a cash assessment could later be fixed. At present we must talk on terms of grain, as prices are so uncertain. VIII. I refrain from any comparison between the receipts from Land Revenue in 1917 and 1918, as political and other conditions in the two years were so different as to make such comparison valueless. The addition of the Mahmudiyah area to the district during the year makes little practical difference, except in the karad (cash) assessments ; as the flow cultivation was a failure, large remissions were necessary. (b) Tapu. —The registration of tapu deeds has not been attempted so far in the district. There are few tapu properties and there has been little trouble between tapu owners and tenants. There are in the district two ‘uqr rights, the one on the Nasiriyah and the other on the Mahmudiyah. Neither is supported by a tapu sanad, but on instructions from the Revenue Board I permitted the collection of both. No one has objected to the Nasiriyah collections. But in the case of Mahmudiyah it was urged that the only ‘uqr right was over a small area near the Euphrates and that under the Turks' the ‘uqr was escheated to Auqaf two years before the British occupation. Auqaf have been informed and advised to investigate. But as no cultivators denied that they used to pay in the past I ordered collections to proceed. (c) Waqf. —The only considerable Waqf property in the district is the Musaiyib waqf gardens. These were let for 1918 for Rs. 11,500 as against Rs. 3,300 last year. Waqf expenditure has by a gradual process been reduced to nil, the explanation being that when we first occupied the area the staff of the Musaiyib and Iskandariyah mosques were paid from waqf. On closer investigation it was found that in Turkish times they were paid from General Revenues. The sums already paid from waqf are being refunded. (d) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues. —For demand statement see statement attached to section on Land Revenue. Musaiyib is not a great grazing district and I consider the Kodah figures satisfactory. At the same time Kodah is a most unsatisfactory tax, and it is impossible to exercise proper supervision over its collection. One large demand for wood tax has been suspended until the question of who is to pay is decided. The sale of wood, especially to Government, involves contractors and sub-contractors. An attempt has been made to follow Turkish rules in collecting, but the Turkish rules are vague. The ‘araq distillation monopoly and the fish tax are farmed for the division as a whole. Practically no tobacco is grown. The figures for slaughter-house tax represent half the receipts, the other half is paid to the municipality. (e) Customs are not collected. (/) Compensation Cases in Musaiyib were considerably delayed in order that all might be dealt with together. A committee sat in Musaiyib composed of the Assistant Political Officer, Assistant Irrigation Officer and a citizen of Musaiyib. The Committee’s recommendations were forwarded, but the decision of the military authorities has not yet been communicated. r i 3 j T ? RI f ATION ;— The Musaiyib and Nasiriyah canals and to a less extent the Iskandariyah are influenced by the Barrage and no shortage of water occurred. Some small canals on the right bank of the Euphrates and also the Husainiyah were adversely influenced by the necessity for opening the Barrage to give sufficient water at Kifl for the working of a military ferry at a time when the wheat crop was at a critical stage. rLater, serious breaches in the Husainiyah banks near Karbala necessitated the lowering of the water, and this caused a shortage at Wand, which is dependent on the Husainiyah. The District Irrigation Officer surveyed a new Wand canal taking out of the Euphrates, but it was not found possible to excavate it at the time at our disposal. However, to guard against a repetition of last year’s troubles, a “ hamal ” has been built in the Husainiyah near Wand. The year was a year of low water. The Euphrates failed to rise and the conse quence was the failure of three-quarters of the land under flow cultivation on the Mahmudiyah. About the time when it became evident that the Mahmudiyah was going to be a failure, the area was visited by the First Revenue Officer, who was touring with the Inspector-General of Irrigation in India, and with the Director of Irrigation in the occupied territories. It was decided on the spot that a new head should be constructed for the Mahmudiyah which should serve also the deserted Latifiyah. The project for irrigating the Latifiyah was later abandoned and it was decided instead to develop the large area to the west of the Baghdad road and between Mahmudiyah and Tall Aswad. Ultimately the irrigation of the land between the Baghdad road and the Tigris to the N.E. of Mahmudiyah will also form part of the scheme. It was decided to include the newly developed area in the Musaiyib district. The new canal is of very large proportions and designed to provide water for some 40,000 acres. It was early apparent that the work could not be done by local labour and accordingly in May Indian Labour Corps were sent to start the work. Owing to the impossibility of calling men out at harvest time, work by Arab labour did not begin till August, and the resources of the district could not bring the numbers of Arabs up to a higher figure than 1,800. 1,300 had been promised, and an average of this number was kept up from August to mid-October. But, throughout, the bulk of the work was done by the Indian labour. By the middle of October the essentials required to give us 10,000 acres on the new canal, over and above the acreage on the old Mahmudiyah, were complete. Arrived at this stage, I was suddenly approached by a demand from two Hillah tribes for an extra 5,000 acres. These intelligent persons had carefully waited till they saw that they would not be called upon for the hated work of excavation before putting in their application. It was felt that we could not afford to refuse, and it became evident that if we were not to violate the custom of the country and pack tribes very closely on the land, the canal system would have to be extended. To this the Irrigation Department consented. The new colonists had to get to work on their distributaries, and the extension branch of the new canal from Tall Dai running out to Tall Aswad is being carried out by Indian labour. The new canal is known universally among the people as the Yusufiyah, it follows the line of the ancient Nahr Melcha or Yusufiyah canal. Its official name is the New Mahmudiyah, but this I hope will soon be dropped. The area commanded lies to the north and comprises a large part of the Radhwaniyah estate, which is the tapu property of Salim Zaibaq and others. The area has not been irrigated for hundreds of years, but when the‘Aqarquf lake bursts its bounds the flood water reaches the area and certain tribes have been accustomed to get small summer crops from the area. These tribes each knew perfectly their “ lazamah,” or “ sakiniyah,” and suggested, though evidently with faint hope of success, that they would like to settle in “ their old homes,” which would have meant that each would have about five times more land than could be dealt with. The tribes in question were Zoba‘, Qartan and Dulaim, and as far as possible each has been given a part of its “ old home ’’ proportionate to the number of men available. They have been generously dealt with and know it. Vacant areas have been filled with tribesmen from Hillah district. The new area should give us some 15,000 acres of new cultivation this year if all goes well. 4. Agriculture .—The introduction of Indian wheat was a failure. Indian and African maize have been most successfully cultivated where sown. A crop of potatoes was raised fairly creditably, but the tubers went bad very quickly after removal from the ground. A form of locust called Abu Jubailah did much damage to the millet and maize crops. The species is said to be non-migratory. M 2Other matters connected with agriculture have been discussed under heads Revenue and Irrigation. 5. Municipalities : I. Musaiyib Municipality .—The Municipality last year was scarcely solvent month by month, and furthermore was indebted to the Govern ment to the tune of Rs. 3,000/— on account of a loan. It was imperative to introduce new taxation to cope with the rising cost of everything, including labour. The Municipality, for instance, paid its sweepers Rs. 12/8/— a month, which was about half the current wage, with the result that it was impossible to get whole-time men. A new house tax of 10 per cent, on the yearly rental was introduced in March and other small new taxes were imposed in May. The house tax assessment had, of course, to be done twice as the members of the Baladiyah committee and the mukhtars who did the assessment had let their friends down lightly. The final result is a highly satisfactory revenue from this source, and nobody has complained of overtaxation. By the autumn the Municipality was in a position to repay its Rs. 3,000/- to Government and has a respectable balance in hand. Expenditure over and above the absolutely essential has been carefully avoided, in order that the Municipality might have the advantage of a fair balance to expend when, as we hope, prices and wages fall at the end of the war. The removal of troops in the early summer made it possible for us to be more economical than would otherwise be the case. In the collection of taxes the aim has been to collect directly only such taxes as can be collected on a “ daftar ” prepared in the office and open to inspection. This means that the Municipal taxation staff and the evils inseparable from its activities is reduced to a minimum. Thus taxes on bread-sellers, barbers, grass- sellers, and other itinerant mongers have been put on iltizam. We have been able to get rid of the “ Baladiyah chaush,” half sanitary inspector, half tax collector, and wholly inefficient, dishonest and expensive. These men have been replaced by a single whole-time sanitary inspector, who has no other duty but the supervision of sanitation. The people themselves are supposed to come and pay their taxes in the Municipal office on receipt of notice* This to some extent avoids the horrors of house-to-house collections. Below is a statement of receipts showing the result of new taxation :— Collections :— January to March (3 months), Rs. 1,684/3/0; average per month, 561/0/0. April to November (8 months), Rs. 13,743/10/0; average per month, 1,717/15/3. The members of the committee take little interest in municipal affairs. II. Mahmudiyah Municipality .—Receipts are just sufficient to cover expenses. The Rais Baladiyah (Haji Hiyawi) died during the summer. There is no one to fill his place at present and the Mamur Shu‘bah is performing the duties of Rais. I had proposed to abolish the municipality, but it is wise to keep it until we see the effect of the re-opening of the pilgrim traffic. Mahmudiyah is the pilgrims’ first halt out of Baghdad when travelling by road. 6. Judicial —Civil justice. There is only one legally recognised court in the district, that of the A.P.O. In cases not heard by the A.p!o. technically, the procedure is to refer the case for advice to the Shi‘ah ‘Alim or the Khatib of the mosque (Sunni) for advice in shar‘ah cases, or to arbitrators or an official (the A.P.O.’s assistant) in civil cases. The advice is taken or rejected. If taken it issues as an order over the A.P.O.’s signature. A practice was found to exist by which litigants, having stated their case before the person to whom it was referred, and got his “ advice ” recorded, went off with the papers without getting the decision confirmed, and nothing more was heard of them. Steps were taken to prevent this. Civil cases are numerous but few are important, most of them being debts dating from Turkish times which the debtors do not deny. Cases involving Government contractors and the property of women give most trouble as neither is a suitable class of case to entrust to arbitrators. Government contractors never seem to keep any accounts, and many cases I should have ordinarily refused to hear had not important Government works been involved. The use of the oath is a very common way of settling cases, too common, but confidence in a man s oath is almost universal. Litigants swear on the tomb ofHadhrat al ‘Abbas at Karbala, or the local saint Abn Jasim. The oath on the Quran seems almost unknown. Practically all cases in which both parties are tribesmen are referred to tribal decision. The following is a classification of suits filed, April—November 1918 :— Class of Suit. Heard by. Number. Recovery of debts - A.P.O. 462 Arbitrators 21 Possession of land - - - - A.P.O. 59 Maintenance and personal status Shara‘ 94 Inheritance Shara‘ 19 655 The above does not include disputes as to tenancy on Government land, which are settled executively, nor some 200 cases referred for tribal decision. The numbers appear large, but most cases involve little more than the issue of a summons and judgment by consent. Court fees have been collected since May, I fear, on a rough and ready system. The sum realised from May to November was Rs. 1,757/12/0. People are so well off that the collection of court fees is no deterrent to litigation. Criminal Justice .—Statistics of criminal cases are not worth elaborate discussion. From March to November convictions were as follows :— (1) Homicide -------1 (2) Attempted murder - - - - - 1 (3) Theft 24 (4) Being in possession of Government property - - 13 (5) Cheating -------3 (6) Offences by officials in their official capacity - - 10 (7) Being of suspicious or bad character (includes security) - 11 (8) Miscellaneous and minor offences - - - 53 116 Most cases were quite clear, except those in which Government officials were concerned. 7. Education. —There is as yet no school in Musaiyib. The Director of Education states that he cannot send a teacher, but has consented to grant an allowance to Kamil Effendi Khatib of the Sunni Mosque, who is competent to give simple instruction. It is hoped that a school will be opened early in 1919. 8. Medical and Sanitation. —A dispensary was opened early in June. The staff consists of a doctor of the Turkish Medical Service and a pharmacist. The institution is extremely popular. There is no accommodation for in-patients; it is not, in my opinion, necessary at the present stage. Fees are not charged, but voluntary subscriptions are invited in vain. 9. Police. —Nil. 10. Shabanah. —Are under A.P.O. Commanding Shabanah, Hillah. H Labour. The demand for labour lies heavy on town and country alike in this district. , , i ^ i i In the town the difficulty is that the trading class is large and the labouring class small. We are also surfeited with departments. A labour officer was stationed in the town in the spring; he placed the apportionment of labour between departments and the wages paid on business footing, but disturbed the almost patriarchal relations which previously existed between departmental officers and the men they employed- in fact there was too much “ damned merit ” about the new system to please departments employing labour. But, from a general point of view, the result was good, as it put an end to the occasional rate wars between competing departments, » 10 1162—1 M 3170 Labour has no representative now and his more essential functions are performed by the Assistant Political Officer. As regards rural districts, demands have been heavy both on contract and corvee labour. A large bund, designed to carry road and railway between Musaiyib and the Barrage, was begun by contract labour and finished, owing to pressure of time by a corvee of cultivators. The District Irrigation Officer was ordered to construct a new road between Musaiyib and Mahawil. It is not known what useful purpose the road was to serve, and on the representation of P.O. Hillah it was abandoned. A road from Musaiyib along the river to join at the Latifiyah with the old Turkish marching road to Fallujah was also ordered. I cannot imagine that it will ever be much used. It is held up at present for want of labour. The New Mahmudiyah canal was also a considerable strain on the resources of the district. It appears scarcely to be realised that the population of the district is one of settled cultivators, who have to work hard at agriculture all the year round. They are in this unlike the cultivators in other parts of ‘Iraq, whose agricultural operations depends on flooded areas and only occupy human labour for a small part of the year. 12. Miscellaneous. — [a) The Baghdad road has been safe for travel throughout the year. There have, however, been a few highway robberies, all, in my opinion, traceable to “ ma‘dan ” Arabs from the Tigris and ‘Aziziyah district. P.O. Hillah was unwilling to take the matter up until definite proof connecting these Arabs with the robberies could be obtained. The capture of some of them returning from a raid on Zoba* flocks at the end of November has now supplied irrefutable proof. {b) It is early to discuss pilgrimage traffic. The Ziyarah, to celebrate the return of Husain’s head to Karbala, came upon us immediately on the re-opening of pilgrim traffic and arrangements were not all that could be wished. I understand that A.P.O. Karbala is taking the matter up. (c) The Musaiyib Bridge was broken early in April and has not been repaired. A cable-ferry was erected in the summer, but it is a clumsy device, unsuited to the needs of the population. The rebuilding of the bridge is most desirable, especially as pilgrim traffic has been reopened. (d) There are railway stations at ‘Awairij, Mahmudiyah, Khan Haswah and Khan Nasiriyah, the latter the nearest, 8 miles from Musaiyib. Considerable use of the railway was made by pilgrims to the November Ziyarah and it was much appreciated. (e) Sequestered Estates. Wand. The management of the estate by the owners’ relations last year was unsatisfactory, and it has been let for 1918 for Rs. 35,000. Izzat Beg s estate. The estate will do quite well this year and it is hoped to recover rents due for 1917 and 1916. But Tzzat Beg seems to have been of the opinion that in the matter of agents there is safety in numbers and each debtor or supposed debtor of the estate interviewed always seems to have paid his rent to a different agent. A large number of the agents have disappeared to Stambul. 13. Establishment and Personnel.— The Mudir Mai, the Mamur ‘Anbar Musaiyib and his clerk and weighman were sentenced to terms of imprisonment for attempting to sell Government grain illicitly. ‘Anbar staffs are being abolished as permanent institutions. The Mudir mal has not been replaced and appears to me an unnecessary official. The New Mahmudiyah will involve the creation of a new post of mamur and some additional qolchis. These have been applied for. An additional English clerk is necessary as correspondence appears to be on the increase. J. S. Thomson, Captain, A.P.O., Musaiyib.172 APPENDIX B. Copy of A.P.O. Musaiyib’s Harvest Report August 1918, No. 1318 of 26th August 1918 to P.O. Hillah. 1. Difficulties in arrangements for the collection of the harvest have in this district been, I imagine, less than those that have been faced in other districts. Three of my principal collecting stations out of four are on the railway, the fourth is Musaiyib itself, where there is ample and excellent granary accommodation and labour. Furthermore three out of four of my shu'bahs consist almost entirely of old Sanniyah estates, so that the additional difficulties occasioned by the interposition of the mallak have not occurred, and, further, the people are well disciplined of old in the matter of bringing in clean grain. My fourth Shu‘bah (Jurf al Sakhr) has not occasioned any difficulty, as mcM of the grain was sold to Bedu in the fields as it was taken over by the mamurs, without the intervention of Resources. 2. The obvious difficulty which faced one from the beginning of things was that of transport. I had hoped that the Zaqarit would solve this difficulty for me both by helping Sarkals and by carrying grain belonging to Government from Musaiyib to the railway, and also by doing the bulk of the tibn work, which remains a serious problem. But in point of fact they were very unsatisfactory during their short stay in the country, now so tragically terminating. I succeeded, however, in getting them to undertake to carry all the tibn of the Musaiyib shu‘bah and Iskandariyah from the cultivators’ fields to the railway or Musaiyib for Rs. 6/4/- per ton. The value of this contract, however, was somewhat vitiated by a change of mind on the part of Resources, who decided to have all tibn taken straight to the railway owing to shortage of baling plant. The Zaqarit were unsettled by this and also by a sudden demand by Colonel Leachman for 500 of their camels at Shithathah. They worked very badly and I am almost glad to have seen the last of them. The blame for the breakdown of this arrangement cannot be placed on Resources, and I think that in any case I should have been able to bring the Zaqarit into line very soon. 3. It is, as you know, a cardinal point in the arrangements made by us that grain should be taken over on one weighing and the process of taking over from the sarkal and handing over to Resources should be a single one. It has not been easy to make people adhere to this in all cases, and I have found several instances where mamurs have taken over grain and then have had to weigh it all over again to Resources. I think the fault here has been with the mamur as often as not, he does not like the arrangement. 4. As regards the special points mentioned by you, I have had no difficulty about the accommodation of British ranks. I made no arrangements as I was not asked to do so, and in out-stations they are mostly in tents. I have made no arrangements for the purchase of grain, designedly, and now that I am to sell grain to the Anaizah to the extent of 1,800 tons, I do not propose that Resources should buy at all in this district. No contracts had been made by them up to date. Labour has been a difficulty at out-stations mostly owing to the enormous wages paid by the Railway. Labour made, after several false starts, some arrangements for Nasiriyah, but I do not think they have been very happy. Haswa was a difficulty for some time, but by raising the wage I think the mamur has got a fairly satsifactory gang together, and the same is true of Mahmudiyah. It was perfectly obvious from the beginning that we should have to arrange for labour outside the town, and, indeed, I consider that it was our business to do so, and the Harvest Officer very properly applied to me from the first. I have had no difficulty about the shortage of bags or rejection of grain. 5. As regards tibn I adopted the simple expedient of telling everybody that they had got to sell an amount equal in weight to their miri, and making an arbitrary levy on cultivators who enjoy a cash assessment. I arranged with the Harvest Officer a travelling collecting station on the Euphrates especially for tibn, and this worked very well until I.W.T. called in the safinahs attached to it for more urgent work. No other points occur to me at the moment as worthy of record. Everything has on the whole gone very smoothly so far. (Signed) J. S. Thomson, Captain, A.P.O., Musaiyib. Copy of A.P.O Musaiyib’s No. 1755 of 15th November 1918 to P.O., Hillah, PARAGRAPHS 1-4. 1. The barley harvest over the greatest part of the district was very fair. Owing to the fact that Indian wheat was sown and failed there was practically no wheat at all, the Government share amounting only to some 300 tons. The Mahmudiyah canal failed to produce any water and much of the crop failed entirely. It was, had we known it, wrong to make any “ push ” to obtain extensive shitwi crops on the Mahmudiyah. The old canal as it stood depended entirely on the spring rise in the river, and never got water till about February, and shitwi crops were, therefore, we may suppose, always precarious and the people dependent on their saifi. 2. Assessment Sih. It was originally intended to assess by a combination of measurement and estimation. The canal engineers were to be responsible for measurements; an assessment committee were to class all crops as good, medium or bad; and the assessment to be worked out on these two data with the help of a rate per “ masharah ” fixed with the sanction of the Revenue Board. The rates adopted were, for barley : good, 400 kilos; medium, 300 kilos, and bad, 200 kilos per masharah. For wheat: good, 300 kilos; medium, 200 kilos; bad, 100 kilos per masharah. The assessment committee consisted of three persons from the Ba'qubah district. I ordered them to do a takhmin in certain parts of the district as well as a classification, notably on the Mahmudiyah. Their work was satisfactory.When, however, we came to apply the rates sanctioned to the areas reported by the D.I.O., it was found in so many cases that the results were utterly at variance with the mamurs’ estimations, previously made, and with known facts that I decided to “ scrap ” measurements entirely, except where they agreed closely with the mamur figures. The errors were so extensive as to show that the fault lay with the measurers and not with rates or classification. The land of different sarkals was inextricably muddled up,and unknown names appeared, while well-known sarkals did not appear on the list at all. The mamurs’ figures naturally depended for their character on the idiosyncrasies of mamurs. The most important shu‘bah, the Musaiyib, was estimated by my Mudir Mai, a man of great experience and ability; the Mahmudiyah shu‘bah was well done by the professional estimators; the other two shu‘bahs were erratic. I accordingly went over doubtful cases in the Musaiyib (i.e., cases in which the mamur's estimate disagreed wildly from measurements). The Mudir Mai accompanied me and did the estimating, on the corn piled in stacks. Not being an estimator myself, all I could do was to make sure that the estimation was done with a single eye, i.e., that all cases were treated alike. We traversed the whole of the Iskandariyah and Jurf Sakhr shu‘bahs. A cursory inspection of the Mahmudiyah convinced us that the assessors had assessed very fairly and we only inspected carefully those cases in which it appeared that revenue could be paid. My previous knowledge and assessors’ reports convinced me that we should have to remit over most the muqata‘ah. And in fact most of the stacks were unhappy looking heaps of wild oats. My general impression is that the district was assessed on the safe side, i.e., underassessed, but not by a great deal, and there were some undeniable cases of hardship. 3. Assessments—Lift Lands.—My standard was that one-tenth of the produce of a baqrah may fairly be represented for revenue purposes as four waznahs of barley and three waznahs of wheat, and on this standard I based my karad assessments. But it is obvious that a standard like this must not be applied individually but collectively, and it worked best in the case of the Janabiyin karads in the Jurf Sakhr shu‘bah, which consist in some 300 baqrahs. In this case I simply told the shaikh that I wanted from his karad people 120 tons barley and 90 tons of wheat, that four waxnahs barley and three waxnahs of wheat per baqrah was to be taken as the standard of assessment, but that he had leave to make alterations (increases or reductions) in 20 per cent, of cases, provided the total remained the same. He embodied his division of the burden in a “ daftar,” and I had only one appeal against the assessment, which turned out to be due to a clerical error. 4. Collections .—For this subject please see the report sent under cover of my 1318 of 26th August, 1918. I have no further comments. Everything has on the whole gone well, except as regards collections from Faisal. Mv personal opinion is that arrangements made were, on the whole, sound, but then they were very much on the safe side, a considerable distance, I think, beyond a reasonable margin of safety. As my district stands as a unit I am not prepared to say that I could have got on equally well without a Harvest Officer. If we are to collect with the safeguard of British ranks, I think a Harvest Officer is essential. But, as I have said above, I think we made assurances somewhere about trebly sure this year. We could get the grain in, weighed and sacked just as well without Resources as with them. The solidarity advantage of having their representative present up to this point is the avoidance of subsequent petty squabbles over weights and possible pilferings when the grain changes hands. We could get the grain to the railway without help. Subsequently to that the matter is one of negotiations with the Army about sacks, trucks, &amp;c., which I think would be a severe strain on our time. We should doubtless also be cheated more than we were this year if we dispense with British ranks, and the process of collection and delivery would be much lower as an A.P.O. could not possibly get round his ‘anbars as a Harvest Officer does. If the Army is going to be in the same hurry for grain this year, some form of British bash- mamur-anbar will be esential to speed things up. We should also need British ranks to look after machinery. APPENDIX C. Copy of A.P.O. Musaiyib’s 605 of 15th April 1918 to F.R.O., Baghdad. I have considered the question of assessing the Musaiyib vegetable tax on the ground. I think that, considering the uncertainty of prices, we must be prepared to forgo something. My impression is that with iltizam collection we should get about Rs. 40,000, and with efficient collection by Government, about Rs. 50,000. As it is impossible to ensure the latter, I think we should do better to tax on the ground. It appears that this custom was not unknown in Turkish times, as the Sanniyah near Samarra used to take 4 as. on each jowah. The jowah is the bank in which vegetables are grown (usually about 12 feet by 2 feet), and I think in default of measurements it is the best unit of taxation. I would propose here a tax of Re. 1 per jowah all round, as I find nearly all cultivators grow cheap vegetables, e.g., “ bamiyah,” and paying kinds, e.g., cucumbers as well. Jowahs are not all the same size, but, again, most people have both large and small jowahs. I would suggest that you permit remissions if a jowah fails, and also, if the price of vegetables goes unexpectedly low, we could reduce the tax slightly. 2. There are at present about 30,000 jowahs laid down in the Musaiyib shu‘bah. 3. I would propose to announce a provisional tax of Re. 1/- per jowah, with a condition that it will' be reduced if prices fall or crops fail.174 4. If my proposals are adopted it will be necessary to make some arrangements to see that vegetables going to Musaiyib from elsewhere are not taxed again. This should not be difficult, all that would be required would be a certificate from the mamur. 5. Telegraphic orders are requested, as, if my proposals are accepted, I will suspend the activities of the vegetable mamur from 1st May. 6. The assessment of shitwi vegetables, which are not grown on jowahs, can be considered later. to escape tax as most kinds of vegetables have their particular regulation size of jowah, which is roughly adhered to, e.g., melons are grown on long jowahs, tomatoes on short, and so on. One-fifth is apparently taken on lift and flow vegetables alike. Copy of A.P.O. Musaiyib’s 1456 of 20th September 1918 to F.R.O., Baghdad. Reference my 724 of 10th May 1918. karads and flow land. I therefore propose to collect the vegetable tax on the following scale per jowah :— Mudawwarah flow land paying 40 per cent., Rs. 1/8 per jowah. Mudawwarah karad land paying 20 per cent., Re. 1/- per jowah, Tapu flow land paying 20 per cent., 0/12/0. Tapu mulk karad land paying 10 per cent., 0/8/-. The total tax on this scale will be Rs. 67,916/12/0. Copy of Revenue and Financial Secretary’s No. 13,033 of 6th October 1918. Your memo. 1456 of 20th September 1918; subject, assessment of vegetable tax. Since the receipt of your letter I have discussed its contents personally with you, and understand that you have already announced and given effect to the proposals contained therein. These proposals involve orders on two separate points : firstly, that we revert to the principle of differentiation of assessment rates in accordance with the previous custom on the different classes of land. The scale which you propose is :— 1. (i) Mudawwarah flow land - - - . . - 40 per cent The announcement having been made by you is confirmed for this year; but it is for consideration, and I ask your views on the point whether the 40 per cent, on flow lands should not be reduced, as in the case of grain tax, to 36 per cent. 2. The second principle involved is your assessment converted to cash per jowah. This you set at Rs. 5 per jowah on karad, and Rs. 3/12 per jowah on flow lands. I consider this assessment light; but, again, as you have announced it, I am prepared to confirm it as a temporary measure for this year* I should be glad to hear from you what you consider the average outturn of a jowah. In the Khaniqin district a jowah normally consists of 500 plants, and though the number would be less in your area I send you this figure for purposes of comparison. 1. ^ee attached copies of my original proposals to F.R.O. (605 of 15/4/18 and 724 of 10/5/18). The proposal to tax at Re. 1/- per jowah was accepted by the First Revenue Officer. The Re. 1 was to represent the khums taken on miri karads and on tapu flow land. Oonseonp&gt;ntlv iIia rm a™ (Signed) J. S. Thomson, A.P.O. Paragraph 1 of 724 of 10th May 1918 to F.R.O., Baghdad. Reference your wire No. 3755 of 26th April. My proposed tax of Re. 1 per jowah was meant to represent one-fifth, and to be so framed as to cover all kinds and sizes of jowahs. I think there is very little danger of people extending their jowahs karads. The tax of Re. 1/- was meant to represent one-fifth, which is the share payable by mudawwarah Ms. I still think this is approximately correct, but I consider that we should differentiate between (ii) Mudawwarah karad land 20 20 10 2. (i) Tapu flow land - (ii) Tapu karad land Copy to P.O., Hillah. (Signed) C. C. Garbett. Copy of Note on Collection of the Vegetable Tax, Musaiyib.and crops of valuable and cheap varieties. But there is a further defect which ought to be susceptible of correction, viz., that there is a vast difference in value between, say, a jowah of melons and a jowah of bamiyah. The tax m my district was admittedly an experiment, and I am not at all sure that it was a success, first, 1 have not yet made my demands, as I have waited till all vegetables were finished and we could see what failures there have been; second, I am not sure that some cultivators will not be hard hit, owing to the failure of their expensive varieties. But in any case the whole scheme is a temporary expedient, and in any intelligent system of taxation vegetable tax would be included in ordinary land revenue. 2. The problem of collection and assessment should not be difficult, but I found this year that my revenue staff were strongly opposed to my scheme, as they, presumably, in old days, looted a very fine revenue from the vegetable tax. Consequently they set out to make as many difficulties as possible. The scheme was that the qolchi of any given area was responsible for counting the jowahs of each sarkal in his area; his work was to be inspected by the mamur, who would propose remissions for failures where they occurred. Further inspections and checks were to be carried out by the mudir mal and myself. These last were necessarily of a cursory nature. In point of fact the mamur did most of the original count himself and left it to the qolchi to keep the register up to date. The qolchis’ subsequent reports have given most of the trouble we have had; they will need more careful instructions another year, as the qolchi is singularly unintelligent and was even indiscreet enough to report as failed jowahs which had never been reported as sown. The time when vegetables are first sown is the important one, as, if the original list is fairly correct, it should not be difficult for the mamur to keep himself fairly well informed as to how things are going, and the sarkal himself can be made responsible for informing the authorities when he puts down a new lot of jowahs. Many sarkals prolonged their jowahs considerably and so got more for their money; this of course was inevitable, but I do not imagine that we lost much by it. (Signed) J. S. Thomson, Captain, A.P.O., Musaiyib.176 Administration Report of the Hindiyah District. 1. Political and Tribal. — General Description. —The Hindiyah District consists roughly of the lands watered by the two new canals, the Bani Hasan and the Jorjiyah, which, taking off from just above Willcocks’s Barrage on the right and left banks respectively of Shatt al Hindiyah, run parallel to the river for a distance of 38 miles. The first 5 miles of the Jorjiyah run through the land of the Yasar tribe, and as the greater part of this tribe resides within the limits of Hillah District, it was found more convenient to include this portion of the land within the adminis trative boundaries of the latter district. Area .—The length of the district is 38 miles, the greatest breadth 14 miles and the approximate area 265 square miles. Boundaries. — The boundaries follow those of the old Turkish qadha, except on the east, where the tribal boundary of the Fatlah forms the natural division between the Hillah and the Hindiyah districts. To the North and West is the Karbala district; to the West, the desert; to the South, the Shamiyah district; and to the East, the Hillah district. Only on the West does the desert form a clearly marked boundary; elsewhere the land is sometimes defined by an arqub or old canal bank, sometimes by a channel; but often merely follows the ill-defined field boundaries of neighbouring cultivators. From a tribal point of view the boundaries are satisfactory, save on the North-West, where the sections of the Mas‘ud are included within the Hindiyah limits. This boundary will eventually require to be revised, the object being to make the district boundaries to coincide so far as possible with the tribal and irrigation boundaries. Until, however, the Irriga tion Department have bad time to work out their water distribution schemes, it would be premature to make any change. On the East the village of Tahmasiyah has been included in the Hindiyah district, but this is outside the Fatlah limits and it will now be transferred to the Hillah district, to which it properly belongs. Administrative Boundaries. —The district is divided into four shu‘bahs— (a) Jadwal al Gharbi, with headquarters in Tuwairij; (b) Umm Ruwaiyah, with headquarters on the right bank of the Shatt al Hindiyah some 6 miles below Tuwairij; (c) Kifl, with headquarters at Kifl; and (d) Abu Gharaq, with head quarters in the interior of the shu‘bah some 3 miles from the left bank of the river. Each shubah is in charge of a mamur, assisted by two katibs and seven or eight qolchis. The Umm Ruwaiyah shu‘bah was created during the past year out of Jadwal al Gharbi shu‘bah, which was of an unwieldy size. Physical Features .—The district possesses certain features which differentiate it from its neighbours on the Shatt al Hillah. The latter are irrigated by canals, which take off from the main river at a slight angle and run more or less parallel to the main river, gradually edging away into the interior. Generally speaking no palms or other trees are found, except along the banks of the main river. Hindiyah, on the other hand, was irrigated by channels, some of them having the size of small rivers, which take off from the main river at right angles, and run East and West, carrying the flood water of the river into the big depressions which, on the West, run from the neighbourhood of Karbala along the margin of the desert for the whole length of the district, and on the East formed a vast swamp to the North and West of Birs Nimrud. All of these canals are fringed with date-trees, while the larger of them have a continuous stretch of gardens along their margin. The drought of the years since the completion of the Barrage has killed a number of fruit trees, but it requires no gift of prophecy to foresee the day in the no distant future when Hindiyah will be a garden district. Tribal Organisation .—The district is almost entirely tribal: of between 30,000 and 40,000 inhabitants, only some 6,000 are townspeople. With the exception of Tahmasiyah, there is only one combination of huts in the whole district which can be called a village; far the greater bulk of the inhabitants live scattered about the district; a few have mud houses, but far the larger proportion live in reed huts or tents. The geographical position of the district is largely responsible for the strong tribal organisation. Every year large numbers of the Beduin of the desert come in with their flocks and herds to pasture in Hindiyah district, and nothing but close confederacy can enable the tribes of Hindiyah to meet the hordes of thedesert on anything like equal terms, either in the field or in the council chamber. It is undoubtedly this factor wh ch has given strength and cohesion to the Bani Hasan confederacy, which contains within itself many jarring elements, and which, without a strong laison d etre, would tend to split into its component parts. Another factor which causes cohesion among the Bani Hasan is the rivalry of the other confederacy, the leaders of which are the Fatlah tribe. Until the arrival of the British on the scene the b atlah and Bani Hasan were almost continuously maintaining either open or secret hostilities. The latter consisted of thefts of horses and cattle. Besides the Bani Hasan proper, the following smaller tribes are generally grouped under the title of Bani Hasan : the Saiyids of ‘Ard, Da‘um, Bani Turuf, Jalihah and the Qurait. The last named are a powerful tribe which, until some 10 years ago, generally sided with the Fatlah, but in recent years have thrown in their lot with the Bani Hasan. The Fatlah confederacy includes the Tufail, Barraqa‘ and Karrafah. The remaining tribe of Hindiyah, the Rahahlah, is a house divided against itself, half desiring the Bani Hasan allegiance and half the Fatlah. There is a constant under current of jealousies and bickerings between the tribes and sections of tribes, the worst offenders in respect being the four main sections of the Northern Bani Hasan group, the Jarrah, the Tharahwan, Chabas and Jamil, who are a constant worry to the A.P.O. Political Situation .—The past 12 months has seen a vast improvement in the political situation in the district. Then highway robberies were common and certain tribes, notoriously the Qurait, were completely out of hand. Their complicity in an important robbery on the river between Tuwairij and Kifl, and the consequent attempt to seize the chief offenders, resulted in a battle between a party of 20 Shabanah and a 100 or so of the Qurait. The Shabanah made no show against these odds, and were driven from the field with a loss of three men wounded, one horse killed and seven rifles lost. Three days later the village was burnt to the ground with the assistance of two squadrons of Indian cavalry, some British infantry and armoured cars. The villagers had all fled, but the show of force had a most beneficial effect on the whole district, and enormously strengthened the hands of the Assistant Political Officer. Mana‘ al Luti, Shaikh of the Qurait, who up till then had exercised no influence whatsoever over his tribe, began to get them somewhat under control, though they continued till the end of the year to be the black sheep of the district. Effects of New Canals .—The political effect of the two new canals in expediting the settling down of the district is quite impossible to overestimate. The land, which had lain waste for years, was brought under the plough and the fallah was filled with hopes for the future, which, for the first time in his memory, gave him a definite interest in the maintenance of law and order. It is entirely because of this vast extension of cultivation that the tribes proved on the whole amenable and easy to control. A further consequence of the new canals has been a great movement “ back to the land ”; scattered tribesmen have been returning to their former homes, while the emigrants from outside, tempted by the rich land of Hindiyah, are coming in as fallalih under the local Shaikhs to an extent which is causing neighbouring A.P.O. to complain of lack of labour in their own districts. It is impossible to estimate the increase of the population of the district in these 12 months, but the local people say there are three times the number that were here a year ago. This estimate is probably not far wide of the mark. Sheep Owners .—The position of the district at the edge of the great grazing grounds of the desert, together with the lack of facilities for irrigation, has caused the tribes to be great sheep owners. As soon as the winter rains have caused the grass of the desert to sprout, large numbers of tribesmen migrate into the desert with their flocks and remain there until May or June, when the increasing heat has parched the grass and dried the water supplies, and when they return to the river. They are followed by the Bedu with their camels, an unwelcome visitation from the Assistant Political Officer’s point of view. This year the ‘Anizah arrived on the borders of the district with plenty of gold and insufficient food supplies. The arrangements for providing them with grain had not materialised. The export of grain from Hindiyah was forbidden, and the result was an outbreak of smuggling of grain which was extremely difficult to stop, and which led to one or two miniature “ battles ” between the Shabanah and the Beduin and caused a deal of ill-feeling.178 Siege of Najaf. —The operations against Najaf, consequent on the murder of Captain Marshall, were watched with a great deal of interest by the tribes. Fortunately the Bani Hasan have for some years been on terms of open enmity with the people of Najaf, and the bountiful harvest which was just maturing prevented any fear of active sympathy with the rebels. The general feeling throughout the district seemed to be that, while not wishing to see the holy places interfered with in any way, it was recognised that the British Government would not allow its officers to be murdered with impunity. There can be no doubt that the conduct of the operations against Najaf and the subsequent punishment of the guilty persons caused a very deep impression. The general opinion was aptly voiced by one of the leading Shaikhs : “ Never have we seen Siyasi like this. In the time of the Turks the guilty invariably escaped and the innocent invariably suffered. You punish the guilty and have done no harm to the innocent.” 2. Revenue : Land Revenue .—The larger part of the district is miri land, paying one-third of the gross produce on winter crops and one-half on summer. Almost the whole of the Abu Gharaq Shu‘bah is mudawwarah, or former Crown land, of ’Abdul Hamid, and the share of Government on this is 44 per cent, on winter and summer crops—a little actually; however, it was not attempted to collect the full amounts this year, except in the case of “ miri ” winter crops, on which 33Jrd was collected, of which 2Jrd per cent, was paid as bonus to Sarkals and 1 per cent, to the Shaikhs. On “ miri ” summer crops, rice paid 30 per cent, and other crops 25 per cent., in each case 2 per cent, being paid to the Shaikh and 3 per cent, to the Sarkal. Mudawwarah paid 36 per cent, on winter crops, 3|rd per cent, being paid as bonus as in the case of miri lands, while summer crops were assessed alike in both mudawwarah and miri land. The assessing of the Government share was a matter of real difficulty. The Turkish method, nominally based on a combination of measurement and estimation, really resolved itself into a series of bargainings between the greedy underlings of the Turkish administration and the local Shaikhs and Sarkals, and the only thing that may be said to have been beyond dispute was that never by any chance did anything but a fraction of the nominal Government dues ever find their way into the Treasury. Under the circumstances uniformity of method of assessment, even within the narrow boundaries of the Hindiyah district, was impossible of achievement. Winter crops were assessed on the basis of measurement by the Irrigation Department and Ciop Experiments; rice was assessed on the Turkish method of measurement and estimation, while other summer crops were assessed by estimation pure and simple. The assessment of winter crops was very much a leap in the dark; at the commencement of operations it was quite uncertain whether the Irrigation Depart ment would be able to give figures sufficiently accurate to form a basis; whether it would be possible to arrive at a satisfactory rate of yield to apply to the Irrigation figures, and whether the tribes would accept an assessment, the basis of which they looked upon with the deepest suspicion. The leap was taken, however, and the results were probably at least as accurate as those attained by other methods while a beginning was made of the only possible method by which accurate results can be attained. The tribes on the whole were satisfied that their lands had been fairly assessed. Winter crops were collected in kind, while on all others Government revenue was collected in cash.

The collection of the barley and wheat revenue involved a considerable amount of organisation. Old granaries were repaired and new erected; quarters were erected not only for the Anbar staff, but also for Resources representatives; granary staff was engaged; bridges were erected over the main canal and smaller channels; new roads were opened out, these and a portion of the buildings being carried out by the Irrigation Department. Before the harvest began to come in the Department of Local Resources had their representatives on the spot ready to take their share in the operations; this consisted in seeing that grain was up to standard, taking it over after it had been weighed, bagging and handing it over to the Inland Water Transport Department, who transported it down river to railhead at Kill, where Resources representatives loaded it into trucks. A certain amount of grain was transported by road to Hillah, but the great bulk went as described. There was some delay in commencing grain collection, and it was towards the end of July when this first revenue grain arrived in the Anbar. Once commenced, however, collection proceeded satisfactorily, and by the 31st of August 1918 over 4,000 tons of grain had been collected against a demand of 3,450 tons, the excess representing repayment of seed advances. By the end of December 1918 the following amounts had been collected :— Government Share. Repayment Seed Advance. Repayment in Kind of Cash Advances. Kilos. Kilos. Kilos.

A committee was appointed, which counted the trees, and on the result of the count the Mamur ShuTah collected the tax. The total was as under : Demand. Collected. Balance. Rs. 32,622 Rs. 28,324/6/6 Rs. 4,397/9/6 This compares with Rs. 11,192 collected the previous year, the increase connoting a corresponding improvement in the honesty of the counter, the result of a year of British rule. Vegetable and Fruit Tax.—^This was farmed—a frank confession of inability to devise a better system. Vegetables are grown all the year round in patches of varying size. The amount paid by the farmer was Rs. 31,000, and the collection of his dues, one-fifth, caused a considerable aitiount of heart-burning; the farmer assessed vegetables consumed at home, in addition to the amounts collected by him on sales in the bazaar. He was entitled to do this, but his assessments were180 considered excessive by the tribes, and it was necessary to make reductions. Until some form of fixed assessment can be introduced it would probably be better to forgo Government share on vegetables consumed at home, and collect merely on what is brought to market. • Tobacco. —The Government share on tobacco is one-fifth. The crop was estimated and the Government share was collected on tobacco at the time of sale. The estimation merely provided a check by giving an indication of the amount which might be expected to be brought eo market. The total amount collected from this source was Rs. 46,682/0/3. (b) Tapu. —As already stated the bulk of the Hindiyah lands are miri. Only two tapu estates exist: one belonging to the Manahim family, embracing a large extent of fertile land in the neighbourhood of the Birs Nimrud; the other held in partnership between one of the Manahims, the Naqib of Baghdad and Saiyid Hadi Qazwini. A considerable portion of the latter estate is under dispute, the tribes claiming that the land is miri and was wrongfully entered as tapu through the intrigues of Saiyid Hadi and his partners. The owners’ share on the disputed lands has been collected and kept on deposit pending the decision of the dispute. On the remainder of the tapu land Government share is collected at one-fifth. (c) Waqf. —There is only one waqf estate in Hindiyah, the Bardawi muqata‘ah, which is administered by Haji Mujbil of Kifl for the service of the local mosque and entertainment of visitors. Under orders of the Auqaf Department, Baghdad, no accounts are to be rendered by Haji Mujbil. (d) Miscellaneous and Special Revenue. —This is collected at the rate of one rupee per head of buffalo, eight annas per sheep and one rupee per camel. (i) Kodak. —No special staff was entertained for the collection of this tax, but 5 per cent, of the sum collected was distributed as bonus to the Mamur Shu‘bah and his staff. This was probably as effective a method as any other. An alternative would be to farm the tax to the Shaikh of the tribe, or to give him a percentage on collections. The amount collected was Rs. 24,356/-. (ii) Slaughter-Tax. —This is collected at Tuwairij, Kifl, Khan Hamad and Tahmasiyah, the tax being farmed for a total of Rs. 5,860. Half the receipts are credited to Government and half to the Baladiyah. (iii) Tax on Wood and Fuel, —This is collected at the rate of 10 per cent, on all sales, except in the case of wood cut on an island, which is charged one-fifth, being considered wholly Government’s. The amount collected during the vear was Rs. 175/9/-. . ' J (iv) Tax on Reeds, Mats, and Charcoal. —This is collected at the rate of 10 per cent, on sales. The total proceeds are Rs. 2,591/11/9. . ( v ) Tax on Petition Stamps.—An eight anna stamp is affixed to all petitions which request the A.P.O. to use his executive or judicial powers. The amount collected was Rs. 934/8/-. (yi) ‘Araq Monopoly and Fish Tax'.—These are auctioned at Hillah for the Division as a whole. Retail licenses for shops produced Rs. 150/-. 3. Irrigation. In few places can British engineers ever have seen so quick a return for their labours. The Hindiyah Barrage had been completed in 1913, but the Turks, despite spasmodic efforts, had entirely failed to complete the excavation of the two canals which were designed to irrigate the Hindivah district Thus the Barrage, by diverting a large volume of water down the Shatt al Hillah effectually mined the remains of the Hindiyah cultivation. Within seven months of the arrival of British engineers at the Barrage, the excavation of the Bani Hasan and Jorpyah Canals had been completed to their designed length of 60 kilometres and an area of over 30,000 acres was under cultivation. As the Arabs picturesquely expressed it: The land was sleeping; she has now opened her eyes.” Naturallv time was too short to complete the banks of the canals, and the engineers were soon faced with demands for more water,” which could only be given at the risk of breaching the banks. Minor breaches, as a matter of fact; were not uncommon, and m several cases serious damage was done to the crops. The difficulties under which the legation Department laboured can only be fully appreciated by one who has worked with them m the district. ^As soon as the Arab saw the excavation complete, and the water flowing throughout the length of the canal, he considered that the task was complete. The canals are designed to carry water above the berm and when a full supply is attained the berms are some 2 feet under water. The banks being incomplete it was unsafe to put down a supply high enough to reach high ground. On the Jorjiyah the banks were poor throughout and the shortage of water was more marked. On the Bani Hasan the difficulty was less, but existed owing to the narrowness of the old Umm al Ruwaiyah channel through which the canal ran for part of its course. This was not large enough to hold the full supply and it was difficult to send enough water to the tail. In the summer it was found necessary to “ ration ” water to Shamiyah, Hillah and Hindiyah. The result was the failure of part of the rice crops sown in the area. As a result of skilled supervision of irrigation no less than 40 square miles of rich land has been reclaimed from swamps. Half of this area will be available for cultivation this season and the rest should be ready next year. 4. Agriculture .—It is of interest to recapitulate briefly the history of the Hindiyah district, since without a knowledge of the past it is difficult correctly to appraise the present agricultural position of the district. Between four and five generations back—about 150 years—began a movement of the tribes from the South into the Hindiyah district, which at that time was largely swamp. The Shatt al Hillah and another branch of the Euphrates, now dry, between them carried the discharge of the Euphrates, the Shatt al Hindiyah existing only in the form of a small canal. There is still alive an old man near Hillah—said to be 100 to 140 years old—who can remember stepping across the Hindiyah Canal. This canal gradually scoured and deepened its channel until it attained its present dimensions and became the mam branch of the Euphrates. During this process there arrived a period when the bed level of the Shatt al Hindiyah was sufficiently low to free the district from a considerable area of swamp, and sufficiently high to provide an ample water supply in average years. This was the rice period. The yearly deposits of silt constantly renewed the vigour of the land, and the older men of the district talk of the good old days when 10 lbs. of seed would under the most favourable conditions produce 2 taghars (of 4 tons)—a yield of close on 1,000 for 1. About 30 or 40 years ago there began a period when the deepening of the bed of the river lowered the water to an extent which rendered cultivation increasingly uncertain and precarious. This process continued until the completion of the Barrage again diverted a large volume of water down the Shatt al Hillah, put the greater part of the Hindiyah district out of cultivation. Eor three years previous to the occupation of Baghdad the agricul tural position was gloomy in extreme, and a large number of the fallahs dispersed North, South and East—a few even finding their way into the nearer oases of the desert. With the opening of the Bani Hasan and Jorjiyah Canals the district has opened a new volume in its agricultural history. An ample water supply is now assured and the Shaikhs and Sarkals are looking forward to a future which is altogether rosy. One effect of the new order of things is that the flood water is no longer allowed to spread its silt over the land, rice can no longer be cultivated as before, and the staple crop of the district is barley and wheat. In the year an area of between 31,000 and 32,000 acres was brought under barley and wheat, the proportion being roughly 10 of barley to one of wheat. The area of summer crops was considerably less, rather over 2,000 acres each of white and red rice and, approximately, an equal area of other combined summer crops : dukhn, mash, lubiyah, sesame, idhrah, safrah, idhrah baidhah, tobacco and vegetables, with one or two fields of cotton. Note .—The following is the local account of the origin of the name Hindiyah as applied to the district. One hundred and thirty two years ago an Indian dug a canal from near the present head of the Shatt al Hillah to supply Najaf with water. This canal was known as the Hunaidiyah Canal, after its author—the name was shortened to Hindiyah and gave its name to the district. The original canal still exists in part of its length, and is being re-opened by the Irrigation Department to supply water to the interior of Kifl sink bah. Willcocks states that the Hindiyah branch of the Euphrates existed in the time of Alexander the Great, but it might well have disappeared, as other branches of the Euphrates are known to have done. There seems no reason to doubt the182 current belief of the local Arab, that a little over 100 years ago the Shatt al Hindiyah was non-existent. 5. Municipalities : (a) Tuwairij .—The town is not large and there is little scope or need for municipal activities over and above the ordinary services of lighting, watch and ward and sanitation. The heads of receipt and expenditure are common to most municipalities in ‘Iraq. A boat bridge was built by the military during the year, and the tolls collected are debited to military funds. But as this involved considerable loss to the municipality, which previously collected ferry dues, a grant of Rs. 150/- a month has been sanctioned as compensation. The watch and ward service costs Rs. 575/- a month, and is met from a special tax. The watchmen are Jannabat (professional thieves) and the system works fairly well, but there have recently been some bad robberies. The municipality is in considerable debt to Government for loans advanced, and, though the cash balance is now beginning to accumulate, it would appear desirable in the new financial year to revise the scale of taxation, with a view to repayment of loans and the provision of a fund to meet expenditure in the future. The municipality should also be in a position to provide in part for the upkeep of the school and hospital, to neither of which it at present contributes substantially. (b) IG/L—Kill is no more than a small village and hardly justifies the existence of a municipality. The inhabitants are, however, largely Jews and not rustics; consequently, some form of municipality arrangements are desirable. The revenues are sufficient to cope with the expenditure and no more. This municipality also draws revenue from Khan Hammad on the Karbala-Najaf road, and in return provides a sweeper and other elementary services for the khan. 6 . Judicial—-The following is a table showing charges on which a conviction was obtained during the year :— Number of Cases. Charge. Against Shabanah. Against other Public Servants. Against Private Persons. Total. Homicide 1 i Theft - 1 1 12 14 Extortion 1 1 o Embezzlement — 3 o Miscellaneous 6 1 14 o 21 8 . Civil Justice.

Tuwairij Dispensary.—A dispensary has been established at Tuwairij to meet the needs of the civil population. The staff consists of an Indian sub-assistant surgeon and an Indian compounder. The building in which the dispensary is housed is sufficiently large to provide room for in-patients and when the grant of Rs. 500/- sanctioned by Government has been expended, the result should be fairly satisfactory. The fees received are at present more than enough to cover the pay of locally recruited establishment and other incidental expenses.183 re is littl 5er viees o| ? ei % t llt % •ttds. 7 ^ollecfeij P e nsatioi 11 a special 'em woife advanced, id appeal a view to he future, upkeep of tantially, ! existence •t rustics; ' revenues &gt;ality also in return ionvictioi Total | 1 I 14 i 2 3 21 aarks on p.O, where most cases tried orh isferredk lisoffotff dished^ anlndif- diiek dif and^J ther# m eil oll r' ipeiis ei ' The dispensary is much appreciated by both town and country. The district contributed liberally to the Red Cross subscription in the summer, the sum collected amounting to Rs. 9,128/-. The average daily attendance at the dispensary is 97 . 8 . Education : Tuwairij School. —There is an elementary school at Tuwairij attended by some 40 boys. These are divided into three classes, but there is only one master. The syllabus used is that laid down by the Director of Education. The mosque was formerly used as the school building, but a move has been made to a house in the town, which is more suitable. The house could be turned into a satisfactory school building by a few simple repairs, which it is hoped will soon be carried out in part, but the chief need is glazed windows, and glass at present is next to unobtainable. More books are required. The school enjoys a grant of Rs. 80 per mensem from Government and receives a small income from fees. 9. Shabanah. —The past year has witnessed the reorganisation of the Shabanah, which, from being a purely district force, has developed into a branch of the Hillah Shabanah, under the command of the O.C. Shabanah Hillah. The most obvious results of this change have been the weeding out of the halt and the maimed, and a very remarkable smartening up in the appearance of the men. The Arab has taken very kindly to drill and undoubtedly takes a legitimate pride in discarding his rags and tatters in favour of a workmanlike khaki uniform. He has also learnt the rudiments of discipline, and has consequently become a more reliable tool in the hand of the Assistant Political Officer. The attitude of the tribes to the new order of things was at first one of suspicion —they did not know but that they might be called upon to leave their home districts and march where required by the English King. In one instance, a Shabanah filed a petition complaining that the father of a girl who had been promised to him now refused to hand her over on the ground that he was a soldier and might be taken away to Bombay or London. Eventually ‘Umran al Haji Sa‘dun, Shaikh of the Bani Hasan, began to bring his men in, and his lead had a marked effect. One of ‘Umran’s relatives was appointed Zabit of the Karbala— Najaf Road Shabanah, which developed into an extremely useful force, and behaved very well* on several occasions when confronted with superior numbers of the ‘Anizah smuggling grain out of the district. The work of the road Shabanah consisted almost entirely in road patrols. Throughout the remainder of the district the work of the Shabanah was that of district police—the delivery of summonses, guarding crops, assisting Shaikhs to get in the revenue, keeping gangs of workmen up to the collar on the canal banks. As was natural in a force which was the direct successor of the most corrupt force in the world, the Turkish Gendarmerie, there was a certain amount of misconduct among the Sabanah—their new uniforms and an increasing sense of their own power under the cegis of the British Government combined to foster in some of their breasts the idea that the Shabanah was a super-man to whom the ordinary rules about meum and teum did not apply. The fact also that they were serving two masters, the Assistant Political Officer, under whom they worked directly, and the O.C. Shabanah, by whom they were inspected once or twice a month, rather tended to confuse them. It is, undoubtedly, an unsatisfactory feature of the present system, but one which at present it is not easy to better. On the whole, however, the new Shabanah force has been wonderfully successful. It is too soon to foresee what the attitude of the Arab will be when the first glamour has worn off; the townsmen will probably always come forward freely enough. Of the tribesmen, all that can at present be foretold is that, as long as Shaikhs like ‘Umran co-operate as they do at present, so long will recruits continue to come in. 10. Labour. —There has never been any difficulty as to labour required for military purposes, and the intervention of the Labour Department was not required. The district is a compact one and, for ‘Iraq, thickly populated. 11. Miscellaneous : Forests. —During the year a beginning was made of a forest conservation. All felling of trees was forbidden without permission, which was only given to meet requirements of Government Departments. A Mamur Akhshab was appointed, whose duty it was to inspect all fellings, see that no more than the permit quantity had been cut, and that the tax was duly credited. He was also expected to inspect the district generally and see that no illicit felling took place. Four localities were specially protected; Makhallat Island, where N 2184 there is a promising growth of poplar, and which it is hoped eventually to plant up, and three areas on the right bank some seven miles above Kill, where there is a thick growth of tamarisk, which, if left alone for a year or two, should afford a useful supply of firewood. In order to prevent hardship, tree owners were permitted to fell not more than five trees for bona fide domestic use. The rules worked satisfactorily and were instrumental in preventing unnecessary waste of timber. It is hoped to do something in the way of planting next year. The problem of timber supply for Iraq will be a serious one for many a long year, and the question of re-afforestation of the country is one that should be tackled without delay. A judicious distribution of seed of suitable trees to selected Shaikhs and Sarkals would be a simple and probably efficacious way of making a start. 12 . Establishment .—The Administrative and Executive Establishment of the district stood as follows at the end of the year 1918 :— Headquarters. — (a) Assistant Political Officer, Captain Thomson. Took over charge of the district from Captain Tyler on the 7 th December 1918. (b) Personal Assistant, Midhat Effendi. Appointed 24th June 1918, in succession to Saiyid Mahmud. Shu^bahs. — {a) Jadwal al Gharbi, Ibrahim Eff. Appointed Mamur in the place of Mulla ‘Abbas, who died on the 27th of December 1918. {b) Abu Gharaq, Mamur Shu‘bah, Saiyid Manzi. (c) Umm al Ruwaiyah, Mamur Shu‘bah, Taufiq Eff. (d) Kifl, Mamur Shu‘bah, ‘Abdi Effendi.Administration Report, Karbala District, 1918. 1. Political and Tribal.—(1) This administration of the Karbala district was only commenced under the direct supervision of a British Officer in September 1917. Last year’s report, therefore, only dealt with the period September- December 1917. Since this time it may be said that the population, both town and rural, have been steadily and quietly settling down to the new order of things. On the whole the population generally appear to appreciate our methods and they realise that various restrictions, such as blockade, passes, &amp;c., were only introduced owing to the exigencies of martial law. The inhabitants generally have co-operated loyally with the Assistant Political Officer for the common welfare. (2) A feature which is not peculiar to Karbala is the fact of a district or town being entirely run by one individual or group of individuals, who stop at practically nothing to achieve their own ends, and who so terrorise the rest of the population that everyone fears to lodge a complaint against them. In the case of Karbala, this was done by certain members of a prominent local family; but on the state of affairs being brought to notice the offenders were removed from the district, which action on the part of Government had the effect of very considerably clearing the local atmosphere, and it is now realised that a man’s former position, dignity, and degree of power, however acquired, will not avail him under British Administration, especially if he is not running straight. (3) The general character of the administrative staff with a preponderating Moslem element has been preserved, only two Christians being employed in the clerical establishment. (4) The jealousy and rivalry among the Karbala religious leaders has in no t way diminished since last year. There is no mutual trust between any of them and each one is merely concerned in trying to increase his own reputation for learning and sanctity. The opinion expressed in the last year’s report that Karbala people have not by any means a blind faith in their religious leaders has been amply confirmed, and it is almost nauseating to hear common people from the town or neighbouring villages with some petty dispute regarding inheritance to be settled discussing to which of the ‘Ulama they shall take their case without showing any sign of trust in the decision to be arrived at; in fact, practically all litigants in cases of this nature beg the Political Officer to settle the case himself, rather than transfer it to one of the ‘Ulama. (5) The Persian Vice-Consul, Haidar Khan, was transferred to Baghdad on 29th November 1918 and has been replaced by Nasir Khan from Baghdad. ( 6 ) Tribal .—The Tribal Administration of Karbala has been effected, where possible, through the medium of Shaikhs themselves, and no trouble has been experienced in dealing with them. The tribes under Karbala are comparatively few in numbers, though the town is a great market for the Badawin, particularly the ‘Anizah, who are, however, controlled by the Political Officer, Desert. A list showing the tribes under the actual administration of Karbala is given in Appendix A. ( 7 ) The general character of the inhabitants varies considerably. Karbala town itself, which is estimated to number some 40,000 inhabitants, contains a large portion of Persians, who have imported the language and characteristics of their race. Owing to the presence of this Persian element many of the Arab inhabitants of the town speak Persian and are to some extent Persianised. The townspeople do not appear to be in any way fanatical, though they are certainly bigoted and from the exceedingly holy character of their town and the fact that they managed in 1916 to expel the Turks, they undoubtedly have a somewhat exaggerated idea of their own importance, now, however, tempered by recent developments in Europe. The tribal element differs in no way from the ordinary riverine Arab, requiring a firm but just hand. As previously stated during the year under review they have given no trouble at all and have paid their dues both to the Government and to the landowners promptly and without demur. ( 8 ) Up to June 1918, Karbala formed a separate district under a Political Officer. In June, however, it became a district under the control of the Hillah186 Division. The Karbala district is bounded on the North by Fallujah, on the East by the Musaiyib and Hindiyah districts. It includes the Karbala-Najaf Road to a point just North of Khan Musalla. It is bounded on the West by the desert and by a line running due West and from a point North of Khan Musalla. (Brief description of boundaries of Civil Districts in the Baghdad Wilayat, dated 20th February 1918.) 2. Revenue : ( 1 ) Land Revenue. — It was hoped during 1918 to assess the land revenue by actual measurement, but owing to lack of expert measurers this idea fell through and watchmen and patrols were appointed to guard against theft pending completion of harvesting operations (vide Fortnightly Report, Karbala District, ending 13th May 1918.) (2) With the exception of three large gardens at Mutlaq al Sharqi, Mutlaq a] Gharbi, and Kurait, which are Sanniyah or private property of the late Sultan, the whole landed property of this district is Tapu ‘Amiriyah. These gardens have been efficiently administered during 1918 by a Government Mudir with gratifying results. The tenants and the Government each take a half share of the produce. From the 1 st January up to 10th December 1918 a sum of Rs. 17,130/9/- has been paid into revenue in cash, and the following in kind has been placed in the Go vernment anbars :— Dates.—243 tons, and about 45 tons remain to be collected. Wheat.—1,160 kilos. Barley.—13,483 kilos. In addition 629 date logs of an estimated value of Rs. 2,032/4/- have been supplied to other Government Departments. (3) The revenue arrangements have worked smoothly and no difficulty or delay has been experienced in getting in the taxes. At the end of 1917 a certain amount of Government grain remained to be collected; this, however, was all brought in and this year collections in cash and in kind have gone without a hitch. (4) The estimate for the land revenue of Karbala during the financial year from 1st April 1918 to 31st March 1919 is Rs. 4,62,850/—. Below, sources of revenue are shown, with details of the amounts actually collected between 1st January 1918 to 10th December 1918, which dates do not correspond with the financial year :— (a) Vegetables and Fruit. —The former paid last year one-fifth and the latter one-tenth on the value of the crop. From 1st March 1918, how ever, the vegetable tax was farmed for one year for a sum of Rs. 65,995/-, which is being paid in at the rate of Rs. 5,426/- per mensem. The total amount from both sources to date is - (b) Fish Tax.—We fish tax has been farmed out since 1st April 1918 to a contractor who pays in to Hillah treasury; previous to this a share of one-fifth was paid to Government, which collected between 1 st January 1918 and 10th December 1918 a sum of ... (c) Tobacco. —One-fifth share, collected between 1 st January 1918 and 10 th December 1918 (d) Crops watered by canal (one-fifth share), crops watered by lift (one-tenth share), a very small proportion of Karbala crops are watered by lift.

They consist of the following :— Fish tax. Tobacco excise. Slaughter-house tax. Tax on wood and charcoal. Confiscated estates and miscellaneous. Revenues. (5) Customs .—There is no Customs establishment as such, though Karbala, being one of the chief points of entry into ‘Iraq, is still a blockade post to prevent the entry or exit of forbidden articles. ( 6 ) During 1918 contraband to the value of some 10,000 Rs. was intercepted entering or leaving Karbala. (7) Karbala, as before-mentioned, being an outlying town, any dutiable articles are forwarded to the Collector of Customs, Baghdad, for collection of necessary duty. Compensation .—Owing to the fact that troops have not hitherto been quartered in Karbala, and no military operations have taken place in the vicinity, the question of compensation has not arisen. ( 8 ) Waqf: Shiah Waqf .—Practically none of the land in Karbala district is waqf; a small income is, however, derived from properties, khans, and shops in the town, and in addition a certain sum is obtained from burial fees. The annual expenditure exceeds the receipts by some thousands of rupees, which is an unsatisfactory state of affairs showing no immediate signs of alteration under present arrangements. In Turkish times the Karbala Waqf establishment was self-supporting; in fact, it was a paying concern. All the waqf receipts for Karbala, Najaf, Musaiyib and Shifathah were sent to Karbala, where the Mudir Auqaf resided. He toured Musaiyib, Shifathah and Najaf supervising the mamurs in these places. In Turkish times also a very much larger sum than at present was obtained from burial fees; the average being £T7,500/- per annum. This question is being gone into with the Director of Auqaf. The old Turkish hospital in Karbala, now falling into ruin, was built from funds obtained over a period of six years by increasing the Karbala burial fees by about Re. 1 /- per head. The Sunni waqf in Karbala was paid from the general funds mentioned in the preceding paragraph and was not separate to the Shkah waqf. A small income is now derived from shops and khans in the town, but as in the case of Shi ah waqf the expenditure is greatly in excess of the income. (9) A statement showing receipts and expenditure of both Sunni and Shi ah Waqf is attached as Appendix B. 3. Irrigation. —(1) As the cultivation of the Karbala district depends almost entirely on the Husainiyah Canal, a description of that waterway would not be out of place. The Husainiyah Canal is on the right bank of the Euphrates, which river it leaves 9 miles downstream of Musaiyib. From its head it runs in a South- Westerly direction for 7 miles, when it turns W .S.W., reaching Karbala some 18 miles after leaving the Euphrates.At Karbala the canal bifurcates, one branch, called the Rashidiyah, running N.W. for 3| miles, whence it turns South-West and flows into the Abu Dibis Lake some 15 miles West of Karbala. The smaller branch, called the Hunaidiyah Canal, circles round the West of Karbala and runs in a Southerly direction to the Haur as Sulaimaniyah. Besides being the source of the drinking water for the town of Karbala the Husainiyah forms a valuable means of water transport from the Euphrates to the town. The canal is in charge of the Irrigation Department, wdio control the water supply. Various regulators are required, which will be arranged for in due course. (2) When the Turks were besieging Karbala in 1916, the bunds which protected Karbala from floods were cut to drive them out, and it is estimated that some 15 square miles of grain-producing land were flooded. This bund has been repaired, and ingress channels to various marshes, the Haur al Sib, the Haur Ibraz and the Haur al Layih, have been closed, with the result that not only has the land deliberately flooded been reclaimed, but a large area besides. It is hoped that this reclamation will be permanent. No major works of importance have been constructed during the year. Labour. —Owing to the distance of troops from Karbala no such demands for labour have to be met as is the case in most other large towns or populated districts. About 50 men are daily employed by the Irrigation Department and these men are found without difficulty from amongst the fallahs of the various gardens. 4. Agriculture. —(1) The general methods of the Karbala farmers, other than fruit and vegetable cultivators, leave much to be desired. Various crop experi ments were carried out in the neighbourhood during the spring and early summer of 1918, the results of which were very inferior to those carried out in the neighbouring district of Hindiyah. As far as can be ascertained, the reasons for the disappointing results were :— (i) The soil is worn out and never allowed a rest, and no system of manuring is employed. (ii) Indifferent ploughing, which allowed the ground to become choked with grass and weeds. (iii) Natural poorness of the soil, which contains on the whole a large proportion of salt and weeds. (iv) Bad methods of cultivation due to scarcity of labour and lack of proper supervision. 2 3 4 5 (2) The results of the experiments were as follows : 3 donums of first, second, and third-class land (1 donum is 2,500 square metres) were sown with an identical quality of seed barley, the yield being 262, 88 , and 67 kilos per donum respectively {vide No. 19/2898 dated 22nd May 1918 from Political Officer, Karbala, to First Revenue Officer, Baghdad). The difference between the first, second, and third- class land is most marked and points the need for improved agricultural methods, particularly cleaning before sowing, and effective use of animal manure or the introduction of phosphates or other chemical manure. (3) The implements used in agriculture in this district are the fidan or plough, the mishah or long-handled spade, the minjal, a curved saw-toothed sythe for cutting grass, and the mirwah for winnowing. The standard of living of the fallah is very simple and he exists mainly on barley, millet, dates and sour milk. The Sarkal does not affect a much higher standard {vide Note from Major Pulley to First Revenue Officer, Baghdad, dated 16th April 1918). (4) Karbala being a Shi‘ah holy city, has attracted a large colony of Persians, who brought the art of gardening with them. The result is that Karbala gardeners are famed throughout ‘Iraq for the introduction of intensive cultivation. Stable manure used to be plentiful thanks to the caravans of pilgrims with their numerous animals. It is now scarce but the sites of ruined villages yield a certain fertilising substance not unlike dark sand, which is found to be a fairly satisfactory substitute. In the gardens in addition to dates are found pomegranates, oranges, limes, apricots, plums, grapes of five kinds, one of which fruits twice during the season, quince, figs and mulberries. There are a few “ maqtum ” dates, these being the best and rarest of all the kinds of dates in Mesopotamia. (Revenue note on Karbala, dated 23rd March 1918). (5) There is some confusion between land measurements in the district, and care must be taken to be certain about which any informant is speaking.A faddan tapu consists of 80 donums (200,000 square metres). A local faddan usually referred to in ordinary conversation with cultivators consists of 25 to 30 douums, and is the amount which one pair of bullocks with two men can cultivate during one year, viz., about 13 to 16 acres. ( 6 ) The land in Karbala district is irrigated chiefly by the Husainiyah canal, and there are a few waterlifts (Arabic karad, plural karud) which lift water by means of a large skin called a dalu, which carries from 16 to 20 gallons at each lift. The Dalu is hauled up by a rope pulled by one animal, which is either a pony, mule or, more usually, a bullock. There is ordinarily one attendant in charge of each animal working on the lift. A karad of this description with one animal and one attendant can irrigate 4 donums or about 3 acres. (7) Casual labourers working on the land in busy times are not paid by the landlord in cash, but in kind and the rate varies according to the terms arranged. ( 8 ) When the produce of the land has been gathered in, the Government takes a one-tenth share when the water has had to be lifted, and a one-fifth share when the water has not had to be lifted. There are several ways of arranging about the division of the remainder between the landowner and the tenants. In the case of a small estate the remnant is divided between the fallah and the landlord, the latter taking from one-third to one-half of the produce according to whether the seed was provided by the fallah or the landlord. The landlord and the cultivators then give one-tenth of each of their portion to the Sarkal; this is called Sarkaliyah. In the case of a large estate the landlord frequently sets aside a certain area for each Sarkal, which is called a “ mutlaq.” The Sarkal takes the whole produce of this “ mutlaq ” after payment of the Government share, and receives no Sarkaliyah either from the fallah or the landlord. The landlord takes one-third to one-half of the remaining produce according to whether the seed was provided by the fallah or by himself. Another system is for the Sarkal to take a certain proportion of grain which is previously arranged between him and the landlord according to the area cultivated, this is also called Sarkaliyah. The remainder being split up in the usual proportion between the fallah and the landlord according as to whether the seed is provided by the latter or not. (9) This year the landlords and tenants are evincing great anixetyto increase the area under cultivation, and this has been rendered possible by the reclamation of much flooded land. This question has been dealt with under the heading of “Irrigation.” ^ 1 ^ , (10) An agricultural calendar of the Karbala district is attached as Appendix C. 5. Municipal. (1) The Karbala municipality now consists of a president and six members, all leading men in their respective quarters. During the year there was considerable trouble over the municipality, all power being in the hands of the President, who unfortunately was not as upright an individual as might be desired As a result of an exhaustive enquiry and trial he was finally removed m July and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for receiving bribes, and for theft ot municipal funds. , ., ,, • • i i- i j n (2) The results were immediate and remarkable, the municipal funds gradually increasing under new management by about one thousand pounds in six months, with no diminution in the expenditure. , (3) The municipal committee deals with questions affecting the lighting, cleanliness and general welfare of the town. . . . „ . (4) The chief question affecting Karbala town as a whole is that of the food supply, particularly grain. Owing to periodical large influx of pilgrims and to the considerable population of the town itself, the question of the food supply is an ever-present anxiety. But ground exists for hoping that owing to increase of local cultivation the state of affairs will shortly entirely disappear or be mitigated. (5) The municipal supervisory establishment consists of 1 Head Clerk and Treasurer. 1 Assistant Clerk. 8 Municipal Inspectors. ( 6 ) Details of taxes levied by the Karbala municipality are shown as Appendix D.190 (7) The total receipts from 1st January 1918 to 10th December 1918 were Rs. 51,746/13/6. The expenditure during the same period being Rs. 36,442. ( 8 ) It may be remarked, in conclusion, that under the presidency of an energetic and capable merchant of the town, placed above temptation by his financial position and commercial reputation, the Karbala municipality is making steady progress towards financial stability and administrative efficiency. 6. Judicial — {a) Judicial cases dealt with in Karbala maybe divided into civil, criminal, and tribal cases. (a) Civil .—The judicial administration of Karbala as regards civil disputes was, in the time of the Turks, carried on by means of a qadhi and two assistants, but, in nearly all cases involving the religious law, the people preferred to consult their own Mujtahids direct. The Turks did not take official cognisance of the findings of these Mujtahids unless the parties concerned had been referred to them by the qadhi. An exception to this rule was made in the case of Saiyid Kadhim al Yazdi, the noted mujtahid of Najaf, which place was in Turkish times regarded as an appanage of Karbala. At the present time practically all the Shar‘ah cases are taken by the people to the Assistant Political Officer, whom they frequently ask to decide the case himself, in preference to transferring them to the Shar‘ah courts. Owing to the complicated state of the Muhammadan law of inheritance, and the, if possible, even more complicated condition of the domestic affairs of the parties concerned, some of whom have been frequently married and divorced several times as well as a question of policy, it had not been considered advisable to adjudicate in these cases and they have all been transferred. Ordinary civil disputes of a straightforward nature not involving questions of inheritance are settled by the Assistant Political Officer. A certain proportion of petitioners in these cases fail to appear, having settled their differences amongst themselves. The following is the method of dealing with civil disputes. When a complainant files a suit in the Political Office the defendant and witnesses are summoned, and if the case appears to be one in which the Muhammadan religious law is involved, the parties are asked to select a mujtahid to whom they would like the case referred. The case is then transferred in accordance with their choice and both parties are warned that they must attend the hearing without delay. The Assistant Political Officer sees that they do so and that the decisions of the Shara‘ are duly enforced. Che principal mujtahids to whom cases are transferred are :— Shaikh Husain al Mazandarani. Saiyid Muhammad Sadiq al Tabatabai. Saiyid ‘Abdul Husain al Tabatabai. Saiyid Muhammad Mahdi al Hujjah. 7 * * * 11 A summary of all civil cases dealt with in 1918 up to the end of November is attached as Appendix E. {b) Criminal CWes.—These are dealt with by the Assistant Political Officer only, preliminary investigations being made by the Inspector of Police when necessary. A summary of all such cases from January to November is attached as Appendix F. (c) Tribal Oases.—Tribal cases are settled by the Political Officer through the medium of the shaikhs in accordance with tribal custom Tribal oases under the jurisdiction of Karbala have been comparatively few and unimportant. This is due to the fact that the most numerous tribe to the south and east of Karbala has been under the jurisdiction of Tuwairij whilst the Eadawin and others to the west have been controlled by the Political Officer Desert. ’ 7. Education. (1) On loth April 1918 a Government primary school for boys was opened m Karbala, and it is now attended by aboul 70 boys, between the ages of 14 and 7 years. J ’ masters 61 ' 6 ^ ^ ClaSS6S ^ ^ ^ COnsists of one headmaster and six assistant 1 he subjects of instruction include reading, writing, arithmetic, geography history, reading the Quran and religious studies, and English. 8 4 I 'Physical drill and games are included in the curriculum, and should be attended with beneficial results. ( 2 ) In June 1918 a Government primary school for girls was opened in Karbala and it is attended by 20 girls between the ages of 7 and 13 years. There are two classes and the staff consists of one headmistress and one assistant. The course of study consists of reading, writing, reading from the Quran, sewing and fancy work. (3) The premises of both the Government schools are well chosen, the buildings being light and with good ventilation, and both the staff and the pupils seem keen and eager to do their best. (4) In addition to the two Government schools there exists in Karbala a Persian school called the Husainiyah school, founded in 1908 by certain educated Persians resident in Karbala. At present the school numbers 108 pupils, and the daily attendance averages about 80. The staff consists of a headmaster and six assistant masters, and instruction is given in Persian. The curriculum includes the study of English, Arabic, reading, writing, mathematics, geography, history, religious instruction. In Turkish times the school was assisted by the Government and this assistance has been continued under the present regime. The pupils in this institution strike one as particularly keen and well disciplined. The premises are not entirely suitable for use as a school. 8 . Medical and Sanitation. —(1) During the year the general health of Karbala may be considered to have been satisfactory considering the primitive ideas of the people regarding sanitation. Fifteen cases of cholera occurred during the year under Report, but fortunately the disease did not spread. Malaria and diseases of the eye claim by far the larger proportion of victims, which is not surprising considering the surroundings of the people. (2) The Municipality, with zeal for progress, have built public latrines in various places throughout the town, the population generally, however, apparently regard them as more for ornament than for use. (3) The streets are swept under municipal arrangements and are kept in a satisfactorily clean condition. (4) A small matter, but one of some interest, is the presence in Karbala of a sort of hereditary vaccinator. This man is a Christian, and is the only one in Karbala. He states that he prepares his vaccine himself, chiefly from individuals suffering from smallpox, and that this has been the trade of his family for some generations. Although a Christian he moves freely amongst the people and visits all classes for purposes of vaccination. He also tours amongst the ‘Anizah and any tribes visiting the neighbourhood. His ordinary fee for a vaccination is Re. 1/-, but rich people pay him as much as Rs. 5/-. (5) The Karbala dispensary has been much appreciated and extensively patronised during the year, chiefly by poor people who wish to get their medicines free. On 30th January 1918 a small ward for 10 in-patients was opened to the public and this is practically always full. ( 6 ) A synopsis of work done in the Civil Dispensary from the 1st of January until the 1st of November is attached as Appendix G. Considering that many in-door cases are only brought to hospital when practically in a dying condition and past treatment, the mortality amongst these cases should not be regarded as excessive. (7) The Sub-Assistant Surgeon in charge of the dispensary has carried out his work with ability and energy, and he enjoys the confidence of the people. 9. Police and Shabanah. —(1) The Karbala police consists of 1 officer and 132 rank and file in the foot police, and 1 officer and 25 rank and file in the mounted police. They are all under the local supervision of a Sub-Inspector of Police, and are borne on the strength of the district Shabanah, no separate police force for Karbala town having yet been formed, though it is hoped to introduce this in due course. (2) The Karbala Police Force maintains order in a town of some 40,000 inhabitants, liable to sudden influx of pilgrims, which may number as many as 300,000 on the occasion of an important festival. In addition, they are charged with the duty of preventing the entry or export of contraband; they are employed on escort duties, and to assist the revenueofficials in the collection of Government dues and guarding of the crops, as well as maintenance of order in the district. (3) The men recruited are local men of a good stamp, and show promise of developing into a smart body of men. They are very keen on improving their drill and turnout. The men are sent to Hillah for training under the supervision of the Assistant Political Officer Commanding Shabanah. 10. Establishment and Personnel. —The subordinate establishment of the Karbala district is contained in the “ Nominal Roll of Civil Sub-Ordinates and Miscellaneous Establishment in the Baghdad Wilayat,” which is a periodical publication. The establishment laid down in that list is considered satisfactory for present requirements. As far as can be judged, after an experience of less than one month in charge of the district, the subordinate Staff generally appear to have carried out their duties satisfactorily.7 July. 8 August. 9 September. 10 October. 11 November. 12 December.

Administration Report of Diwaniyah District. 1. Political and Tribal : Geographical .—The Diwaniyah district comprises an area of approximately 2,800 square miles, extending along the Hillah branch of the Euphrates for 45 miles, and East and West of that river for a total distance of about 65 miles. The northern boundary, on the left bank of the Shatt al Hillah, coincides, for some 6 miles, with the ancient bed of the Shatt al A‘mah—sometimes known as the Solumbah; it then turns N.E., following a line of artificial landmarks erected between the lands of Abu Chumak, cultivated by the Al ‘Uwaidiyin tribe, and situated in the Hillah district, and the lands of the tribe of Al ‘Amar, in Diwaniyah district; thence it follows the outer fringe of cultivation along the left bank of the Shatt al Dagharah, curving South parallel to the river, to its termination South of Al Budair. From thence it again runs East, curving later to the South so as to include the major portion of the cultivated lands of Tarkhumah, situated in the Jazirah between Al Budair and the Shatt al Gharraf, and ultimately the boundary turns West, forming the southern boundary on the left bank of the Hillah branch, which it crosses some 12 miles North of Rumaithah, demarcating at that point the border between Al Jubur tribe of Rumaithah, on the one hand, and Al Quwan al Hamzah of Diwaniyah district, on the other. The Northern boundary on the right bank Shatt ai Hillah coincides with the Muhannawiah canal, the lands watered from it being Diwaniyah district, and continues West to Hor Ibn Najm; thence South, including in Diwaniyah district, the lands of Wuraiji, Tar, Tahaniyah, Rishadah, and Shijr, the border between Abu Sukhair district being defined by artificial landmarks recently erected. The boundary continues South, including in Diwaniyah the extensive lands of Sanniyah and Shufaiyah and, further South, the ancient ruins of the Rumahiyah, and, finally, bends East till it reaches the Hillah branch at the northern limit of the'Tapu estate of Saiyid Muhsin Abu Tabikh, at a point some 8 miles upstream of Rumaithah. Character of Inhabitants. —The tribes located on the Shatt al Dagharah have from time immemorial held a reputation for reckless lawlessness, which they well merited. Except in the immediate vicinity of Diwaniyah, the Turkish Government was able to exercise a merely nominal control, and resorts to armed force met with indifferent, or purely local, success, while occasions are recorded, on which Govern ment troops retired precipitately, having been decidedly worsted. Intertribal warfare on a large scale was very frequent, and the district was at all times infested with bands of marauders. The townspeople of Diwaniyah. Dagharah, Qakat Haji Mukhif, and ‘Afaj were the victims of incessant robberies py night, while cold-blooded murders were of almost daily occunence. The presence of strong forts at intervals of about a quarter of a mile from each other bore eloquent testimony to the unsettled state of the country. No shaikh dared leave the limits of his tribe, and at all times an armed bodyguard was necessary. The history of the shaikhly houses records the names of but few who died a natural death. Political. For some months previous to the appointment of a British Assistant Political Officer, in April of the year under review, an Arab Government agent had represented Government. He arrived at a time when a small detached garrison of the Turkish force, which had retired up the Euphrates, was being besieged by the inhabitants of Diwaniyah, and the town was in an uproar. He, therefore, remained for some time in Dagharah town. There the tribes demanded salaries for keeping the peace, though at the time a severe intertribal fight was in progress They besieged the Government agent in the Sarai, and exercised a mild form of torture by denying him rest, employing the simple process of executing an incessant war dance on the roof and around the building, until money was forthcoming. His arrival was, therefore, inauspicious, and general lawlessness continued throughout his tenure. . A British Assistant Political Officer was appointed m April 1918, and about a month later a small garrison of troops was sent to Diwaniyah. Najaf affairs x IO 1162—1 °198 were at the time being closely watched by all the tribes, and there is little doubt that, had the disturbances not been dealt with in a firm manner, the Diwaniyah district would have been seriously affected. A small faction existed in Diwaniyah strongly suspected of being in close alliance with the Najaf insurgents. Their ringleader was deported, and three others were executed as the results of two singularly cold-blooded murders. This action definitely cleared the air, as far as the townfolk were concerned, and acted as a useful warning to the tribes. The law-abiding inhabitants were much relieved at the action taken. Salaries which had been granted in the time of the Arab agent to tribal shaikhs for nominal safeguarding of roads were discontinued and each shaikh informed that he was personally responsible within his tribal limits. This action, credible shaikhs have since remarked, gave the impression of intent and power to insist on order being kept, more than would have at that time resulted from the arrival of a considerable force. The main object to be achieved was to establish law and order, to enable revenue to be collected in kind and purchases made, grain being urgently needed by the Army, and the district containing very extensive crops. Time available for the purpose was short, and the Turks had never been able to collect revenue, so that it was by no means certain whether the tribes would accept the situation. The main obstacle to the establishment of order was the existence of some 400 forts. Troops were not available to demolish these, even should the use of force have been considered desirable. A beginning was made, by ordering one or two forts to be demolished as punishment for offences, care being taken to select those within easy reach, which could have been dealt with by the small Diwaniyah garrison had necessity arisen. The system was gradually extended as a means of settling disputes resulting from capture of neighbouring forts, &amp;c. After a few weeks the idea of demolition was no longer so abhorrent, and a tribe was induced to offer to destroy all their forts. Although they, perhaps, did not expect the offer to be taken too literally, an excellent loophole was thus afforded the A.P.O. A council of selected Shaikhs was called, and they were asked to co-operate for the common weal. They agreed that, if the order were made universal, they would begin demolition on a given date. On the day in question work started, each section demolishing, almost brick by brick, with its neighbour, on whom a watchful eye was kept. By constant exhortation to further efforts, and frequent inspections of each tribe, the last of 380 odd forts and towers was destroyed *a few weeks later. Some attempts to rebuild were nipped in the bud, after which a period of peace and safety ensued, which has endured. The general opinion is undoubtedly to the effect that the revenue exacted has been more than compensated for by complete safety now enjoyed, not to mention the immense saving in expenditure, such as wages of sentries and bodv- guards, watchmen, on crops, purchase of arms and ammunition, &amp;e. He who sows has now reasonable expectation of reaping, and the former professional fighter has become an honest tiller of the soil. General Distribution of Inhabitants .—The towns of Diwaniyah, Dagharah, Qakat Haji Mukhif (Jikah) and ‘Afaj, have each a fixed population of, roughly! 8,000 souls. They were formerly invariably on bad terms with the surrounding tribes, due to the depredations of the latter. The tribes of the district fall into four main groups :— (A) The Khazahl, who cultivate on the shores of Hor ibn Najm. (B) The ‘Aqrah group, whose lands extend along both banks of the Dagharah from its mouth to near QaTat Haji Mukhif. (C) The ‘Afaj group, from Qal‘at Haji Mukhif to south of ‘Afaj. (D) The A1 Budair group, at the tail of the Shatt Dagharah. There are, in addition, two important separate tribes: (1) A1 Sa‘id and (2) A1 Jalihah. Since this is the first annual report on the district, it may not be out of place to comment on these groups in some detail. The Khaza‘il, ‘Afaj and A1 Budair groups have recognised paramount shaikhs. The shaikhly house of A1 ‘Aqrah has, however, long since become impoverished, and has no power. The Khaza‘il, by reason of their originally having come from the neighbourhood of the Holy City of Mecca, rank first in the social scale, and are treated with arespect almost equal to that manifested towards the Saiyids. As a result they are overbearing m them attitude to others. The only Khaza'il Shaikhs with whom the Diwamyah Administration is concerned are ( 1 ) Chassab al Hamadi. ( 2 ) Sahan al Shadan. (3) Ghazi al Dirs. rs ’ ^ 10 18 ^ ie Paramount shaikh, is occupied in cultivation. He is s ow-wi ed, and, as a result, was dilatory in compliance with Government orders, and had to be detained in Hillah as a corrective early in the year. He has since behaved well. Besides Khaza‘il, he has a conglomeration of tribes under him, as lallahs, over whom, until he received a measure of official support, he was able to exercise little control; moreover, he was involved in an interminable quarrel with j ^ re § a &gt; 1 ( ^ m 8 ’ ^ ie land boundaries, which had been the cause of much bloodshed previous to British occupation. The dispute involved many points of dimculty and provided the most intricate of many boundary problems settled during the year. Boundaries are now definitely fixed and the feud ended. Sahan al Sha lan has at present practically no cultivation, his section being camel owners. He is anxious to settle down, and it is hoped to provide him with suitable land at an early date. He exercises a somewhat flimsy control over the Beduin tribes of Al Qaraghul, Al Haraksah, and Al Shallal and has been most useful in dealing with them, whilst employed in transporting the harvest and bringing grain to Government Ambars. The ‘Aqrah group consists of the following tribes :— ( 1 ) Al Shabbanah. (2) Al Hamad. (3) Al ‘Amr (and Al Hulailat). (4) Al Qurush. (5) Albu Nail. ( 6 ) Al Majawir. (7) Al Zaiyad. ( 8 ) Al Murammadh. ( 1 ) The Shabbanah, numbering about 1,500 fighting men, cultivate on the Shatt Dagharah left bank, opposite Dagharah town. Shaikh Sha‘lan al ‘Atiyah has the tribe w^ell in hand, is popular, and has a high reputation for straightforwardness. He has been consistently well behaved and helpful since the occupation. (2) Al Hamad number some 1,800 fighting men, and include Al Zubaid, Al Manasir, &amp;c. They cultivate on the Dagharah right bank, downstream of the towm, drawing water from the Nahr Chaichah. The tribe has a bad reputation. They were all professional thieves and Shaikh Sa‘dun al Rasan is a crafty and unscrupulous person, incapable of speaking the truth. He requires constant attention, and, although his behaviour has improved, he would be the first to give trouble could he gain an opportunity. He is very unpopular with his tribe and other shaikhs. Under the Turks he was frequently in prison, and his tribe was once severely punished by a large force, while he himself fled for some years to Ibn Rashid. The actual management of the tribe is in the hands of his nephew Rasan, a promising young man who would serve Government well as Shaikh. Sa‘dun’s recreation is intrigue. (3) Al 'Amr and Al Hulailat cultivate on both banks of the Dagharah from its mouth to Lagharah town. The tribe had no recognised shaikh till, on admini strative grounds, Haji Hamzah was appointed. He has to be constantly supported in his position, but is gaining in efficiency. He is fortunate in possessing the support of Husain al Salih of the Hulailat, a far wiser man, who would, however, not be acceptable as Rais of Al ‘Amr. The tribe is poor and is ill-armed in comparison with other tribes. (4) Al Qurush, Shaikh Miz‘al al Raddam, are the original shaikhly house of Al ‘Aqrah. They are greatly impoverished and for some years have led a precarious existence, being in turn championed by Al Shabbanah, al Hamad, and Al ‘Amr, and as often looted by the opposing party, and thus a constant cause of warfare. To settle the difficulty and to provide for their inability, owing to prestige, to reconcile themselves to a subordinate position, they have been permitted to deal with Government direct, as a tribe—an arrangement which has met with universal200 satisfaction. They are still much respected and do not intermarry with the rest of A1 ‘Aqrah. (5) Albu Nail, numbering about 1,500 fighting men, possess lands on the Dagharah right bank behind A1 ‘Amr, like whom they had no recognised shaikh. ‘Abd al Risalah was selected. He has no personality and requires constant support, but is the best of the many Sarkals of the tribe, which very loosely holds together. ( 6 ) Al Majawir are much scattered, some cultivating in Shafahyah on the Hillah branch, right bank, others on the left bank near Diwaniyah. Their Shaikh, Salman al Hasan, lives in the town, and they are losing tribal cohesion. (7) Al Zaiyad, Shaikh ‘Alwan al Chahali, cultivate behind Al Hamad, drawing water from the same canal, formerly a cause of incessant quarrels. They have suffered much from the intrigues of Sa‘dun al Rasan, who strives always to under mine ‘Alwan’s authority in his tribe. During the first few days after the appointment of an A.P.O. a serious fight took place between the tribes, resulting in approximately 100 deaths. No fighting has since occurred, though feelings have, on occasions, run high, and prompt action was necessary to check a tendency to fly to arms. ( 8 ) Al Murramadh, under Dohan al Challab, are a peaceful tribe, formerly oppressed by Al Hamid. The ‘Afaj group are a wealthy confederation, formerly under Haji Mukhif as paramount Shaikh, he having wrested the position from Mandhur al ‘Abdullah, the hereditary Shaikh. The former, learning that certain objectionable dealings with Revenue Officials had become known, tendered his resignation, which was accepted. At the request of the tribes, Mandhur was reinstated. Haji Mukhif, after some futile attempts to cause inconvenience, has apparently reconciled himself to his position as a wealthy merchant and owner of a valuable Tapu estate. The ‘Afaj Shaikhs are, on the whole, well able to control their tribes and are pleasant mannered. They have never been directly disobedient to Government orders, but are prone to delay in compliance, prone also to petty intrigue, and are more inclined to deal unfairly with their Sarkals than the Dagharah Shaikhs. This is probably due to the fact that in Turkish times they were not controlled and used to combine to oppress their Sarkals. Such a combination gave the Shaikhs considerable power, which they were not slow to abuse. Cases of severe oppression are not infrequent, and reliable information is difficult to obtain, since Shaikhs support one another to an extent unusual in a country where every man is, as a rule, willing to inform against his neighbour. The group comprises :— ( 1 ) Al Bahahithah, under Shaikh Haji Barman, a powerful tribe numbering about 3,000 fighting men. (2) Al Hamzah are under ‘Abbud al Hamad, an old man, of genial disposition but very close-fisted. Fighting men about 3,000. (3) Al Sha‘bah under Rasan al Shabib, numbering about 1,800 men. (4) Albu Nashi, Shaikh Badr Abu Hasanah. They share with Al Sha‘bah a reputation for bravery which was doubtless needed to protect themselves from the larger tribes of Bahahithah and Al Hamzah. (5) Al Makhadharah under Dhahir al Farman, 1,000 fighting men. ( 6 ) Al Ghanim, Mandhur al ‘Abdullah the paramount Shaikh of ‘Afaj. Since his appointment he has dealt with his tribes tactfully and is improving in control. (7) Al Chuhaish under Manahi al Muqotar, nephew of Mandhur al ‘Abdullah, and his right hand man. A quiet and reserved character, he sets a good example to less obedient shaikhs. The Al Budair group comprises— ( 1 ) Al Farahanah, who cultivate on both banks, and on the right bank are subject to Shaik Sha‘lan al Haji Shahad, a verj^ trustworthy and useful Shaikh, and on the left bank are under Shaikh Haji Saqban, an amusing person, the local wit, who is an inveterate schemer, endeavouring to conceal his intrigues under a guise of senile stupidity. He is an extraordinarily good judge of character. (2) Albu Husain, under Faisal ibn Miz‘al al ‘Aufi. These tribes are subdivided into many sections and number in all some 15,000 men, of whom about 7,000 have now returned to their lands, and others are constantly arriving. When the ShattHillah failed, about 1898, these tribes dispersed. On its revival, due to the construc tion of the barrage, a few returned, but were at the mercy of the Dagharah and ‘Afaj tribes, who controlled the water supply. Last season the supply was ensured for the first time and considerable cultivation resulted. At present the tribes are rapidly collecting and there seems every probability of A1 Budair recovering. Years ago it was an important area and was the seat of a Quaimmaqam. AlSahd possess excellent flow lands near QaFat Haji Mukhif. They number some 1,500 men, and belong to the Zubaid confederation. Their Shaikh is Mudhhir ibn Saiqab. He had to be dealt with for dishonest practices with Revenue officials, but has since behaved exemplarily. A1 Jalihah, under Shaikh Marhun al Haji Khalkhal, cultivate west of ‘Afaj on the Shatt Ju‘an Canal, from the Dagharah. In the Shafahyah area there are a number of small sections of tribes from various parts of ‘Iraq, including the Cha‘ab, who originally came from the neighbourhood of Muhammarah. In addition, scattered throughout the district are many important Saiyids, who are successful cultivators, and often serve a useful purpose as a “ buffer,” their lands separating two hostile tribes. A section of Jubur under Furaiyih al Ta‘an, cultivate in Wuraiji, on Hor ibn Najm. In concluding this section of report it may be noted that the tribes have, on the whole, behaved remarkably well—far better than from their previous history would have been anticipated, and they fully realise that they are entering on a period of progress, which they welcome. 2. Revenue. —It may be fairly stated that the greater portion of the time of the A.P.O. is employed in Revenue work, or in affairs indirectly connected there with. The District will probably prove to be one of the largest Revenue-paying areas of ‘Iraq, and being almost entirely tribal cultivation, disputes as to land and water rights are innumerable. A statement of Revenue receipts is given in Appendix E. Land Revenue .—The procedure during Turkish times was for Mamurs to be sent out to measure and classify crops. “ Measurements ” were arrived at over a cup of coffee in the Shaikh’s Mudhif. One or two of the leading Shaikhs who owned property in the towns, and were on intimate terms with Government officials, used to pay a sum equivalent to 1 per cent, or 2 per cent., but the remainder paid absolutely nothing, their debts running on from year to year. Occasionally Government would select a tribe as an example, and despatch Mamurs with a considerable military force to collect revenue. On one occasion the garrisons of Hillah, Samawah and Diwaniyah, together with tribal assistance from Al Aqrah and the Muntaficj &gt; attacked Al Bahahithah and besieged them until Government dues were paid. The Shaikh and some relatives were publicly executed in Diwaniyah. A moderately successful revenue was collected the following year, after which payments again lapsed. Revenue on Miri land was in theory 40 per cent., though less than 2 per cent, was realised on the total crops of the district. There is little doubt that the tribes could not support such a high rate as 40 per cent., consequently they were informed that the official rate would be 331 per centIt might be argued that, since Government had hitherto been defrauded of revenue there was the more reason why it should now be exacted in full, but the Shaikhs and Sarkals had become accustomed to a certain standard of living, and entertained on a generous scale, and a man who suddenly finds his income considerably reduced, be it derived as it may, must necessarily experience hardship. For this reason a temporary reduction of 8 | per cent, was sanctioned. Measurements were made by the Irrigation Department, but they were found to be inaccurate—names of cultivators were incorrectly recorded—and therefore useless for assessing revenues; consequently a Committee was formed for each Shu‘bah and proceeded to measure and classify crops. The area under cultivation for winter crops totalled 125,927 masharahs or 78,704 acres, irrespective of lift lands, which provided a further 25,150 acres After making the necessary reductions according to classification, the net or safi ” total was 81,474 masharahs or 50,921 acres On this the Government share at 25 per cent, was 10,594 tons, being 3,330202 odd tons wheat and 7,263 odd tons barley. The Government share is thus arrived at:— (1) The crop is measured in masharahs (Kharbut). (2) It is classified (Tajbir) as 1st, 2nd, 3rd class or less (in which case percentage of loss is recorded, and the cause of failure). (3) From 1 st class one-sixth is deducted. From 2 nd class one-fifth is deducted. From 3rd class one-fourth is deducted. This is generally supposed to represent Government’s contribution towards the expense of harvesting, and threshing the official share. The number of masharahs finally arrived at (Safi), is multipled by 500 kilos, being the theoretical yield per masharah. Thus the net yield is arrived at, from which the Government percentage is calculated. The crop is equally divided, the fallah taking half and the Sarkal half, out of which the latter pays the Revenue. Crop experiments proved the theoretical yield per masharah to be a fair working average. Waterlifts were taken at a fixed assessment and crops were not measured. The rate levied was half ton barley, half ton wheat for each bucket on the Dagharah; and two-fifths ton barley, two-fifths ton wheat for the Shafafiyah area, where the lift is very high. The work of the Assessment Committees proved unexpectedly good. Some reliable landowners were induced to serve on each committee, a considerably better class of men than employed by the Turks. The tribes were greatly alarmed when measurements actually took place, such methods never having been experienced before. Complaints poured in at first, many of them before the petitioner had ascertained his measurements or classification, the mere sight of the measuring rope having filled him with forebodings of ruin and starvation. A meeting of Shaikhs and Sarkals took place at ‘Afaj, at which the tone was somewhat truculent. A few examples were worked out for their benefit to show how the official share was arrived at and what would remain for the Shaikh. They refused to understand and said they saw nothing but ruin before them. The meeting broke up in a happier mood on their being given a personal assurance that Revenue would not be more than they could comfortably support. All now agree that, after paying Revenue and selling a further 15 per cent, to the Army, they are as well off on the remainder as in former years, owing to great savings in expenditure on arms and ammunition, not to mention customary pourboires to Turkish officials. The system outlined above was also satisfactorily employed for summer crops, on which Revenue was similarly collected at 25 per cent. The data on which Government share is based are given in Appendix A. Summer crops covered 13,466 acres. Tapu .—With the exception of the large estate on the Shatt al Dagharah, owned by Haji Mukhif and his brother, Mushir, there is no Tapu of importance in the district. Revenue on winter crops, nominally 20 per cent., was reduced as a concession to 18 per cent. There is Tapu property in the towns, and the need of a Tapu office is becoming felt, where claims may be registered and sales recorded. Waqf .—There are no Waqf receipts or Waqf property in the area, which is singularly devoid of mosques. Such as exist are in bad repair. The Sunni mosque received its funds from the Baghdad Auqaf. Miscellaneous Revenues—Be&amp;ovQ the Shatt al Hillah failed the area was rich in date-palms. Young trees are coming on, and cultivation on land unsuitable for crops is being encouraged. Date-palm tax varied from As. 2 | to As. 8 /- per palm, according to locality. ^A flat rate of As. 6 /- has been temporarily fixed for Miri and As. 3/- for Tapu, without prejudice to future revision. Vegetables were assessed this year on the “ juwah ” or furrow system, each juwah paying Rs. 1 /-, the standaid length of a juwah being fixed at 10 metres. Vegetables grown in ^ains or small clusters were assessed similarly. The method has the disadvantage of being difficult to check, as the same juwah often produces several crops in succession, and correct assessment depends upon the ability of the Mamur and Qolchis to keep a careful and up-to-date record. It is, however, vastly superior to the method of pursuing vendors of vegetables in the markets for recovery of the tax, which causesmuch petty annoyance, and tends to keep vegetables out of the towns where they are required, so that most of the crop is consumed outside and escapes taxation. The tax from this source realised Rs. 50,000/-. Fish tax is collected at one-fifth, and a fair amount of fish is brought from Hor ibn Najm. Owing to the impossibility of controlling the tax, it was farmed. Kodah was arrived at by arrangement with the Shaikh of each tribe, who contracted for a fixed amount. It was not a farm, as in most cases only the actual amount contracted for was divided amongst the various sections of the tribe. The sheep are much dispersed, and counting in the district would certainly produce poor results, and probably lead to disturbances. The sum realised under this head was Rs. 63,521. Slaughter-house tax, as is customary, is divided between general revenue and Baladiyah funds. Other taxes are :— Wood and charcoal ------ One fifth, Matting ------- One fifth, Reeds One tenth, Brick kilns tax - — ‘Araq tax ------ - — —all realising small amounts. Customs. —Nil. Compensation .—A certain amount of revenue had to be remitted as compensation for damage to crops by locusts, bat this was not extensive. More damage was done by hailstorms accompanied by high winds. Compensation on Military grounds has been very little. 3. Irrigation.— Towards the end of 1917 attempts were made to re-dig the Yusufiyah Canal and the Bazul, but, owing to the unsettled state of the district, the projects were abandoned after a good deal of work had been done, as sufficient labour was not forthcoming. On the Shamiyah side an attempt has been made to revive the extensive lands of Shafafiyah, by the clearance of the Shafafiyah Canal. The work was carried out by allotting a fixed amount to each tribe in the district. The work was calculated to be 60,000 men-days. Some 2,500 men completed it in less than 15 days. The Shaikhs were each paid a lump sum representing the work of their tribe, and they bore the expense of feeding their men on the work, &amp;c. The system appears the only sure one for completing large works satisfactorily in tribal areas. Casual labour employed by the day is difficult to obtain and results are always poor. A scheme for connecting the ‘Aqar, by bunds across the Hor ibn Najm, to the Sanniyah Canal, to provide further water for Shafafiyah, had to be postponed till next year owing to rise of water in the Hor. On the Dagharah side no extensive works have yet been possible, but it is hoped tha.t, early in 1919, a new canal will be dug from 1 the Dagharah to the old Yusufiyah Canal, and thus again bring under cultivation the very fine lands of the Fawar, which, if sufficient water were available, are capable of bearing crops equal to both Dagharah and ‘Afaj Shu bahs. Attempts have been made by the Irrigation Department to control the water on the Dagharah, a good deal of which was certainly wasted; but, owing to the ignorance of subordinate officials, and the fact that the Arab A.I.O. who preceded the British A.I.O. now in charge had collected an exceedingly poor class of men for the posts, much unnecessary damage to summer crops occurred, and the tribes would have done better left alone. Great improvement is now becoming evident under the present A.I.O., who, however, in the Dagharah irrigation area, has moie work than is possible for one officer to efficiently supervise. At A1 Budair, crops will greatly increase this year, consequent on the digging of the Nahr Thuraimah and return of large numbers of tribesmen as a result. On the other hand, much land in Dagharah will require a rest, since the ground, having been cultivated continuously for several years, is impoverished. There appears a great need for subordinate British officials for supervision of the lowei^ grade of irrigation employees, who are in a position to cause much injustice to Shaikhs, if they consider themselves not sufficiently well provided for by the lattei. Theie have been a vast number of complaints on this score, and Shaikhs have constantly asked if British soldiers could not be employed on the work in lieu of untrained Arabs, who have almost invariably abused their position. The I irigation Officers have been at great pains to deal with such questions^ but aie handicapped by the difficultv of finding suitable men to replace offenders dismissed. 0 4204 The fact that the Irrigation Department has also been responsible for upkeep of roads and public works in the district, has still further reduced the time officers can find available for irrigation work, which must suffer in consequence. 4. Agricultural. —Wheat and barley are the principal crops of the district. Of the former, the wheat of Shafafiyah is particularly celebrated and is much sought after for seed. Varieties of wheat and barley grown are :— Wheat: Muhairmah—short, beardless ear, white; makes good bread. Daudiyah—long-bearded ear, dark red. Hunaishiyah—long-bearded ear, large grain, yellow ; bad for bread. Humairah—long-bearded ear, small grain, dark red; used for bread, used in cooking. Sinn al Fil—like Hunaishiyah. Judiriyah—short-bearded ear, yellow; good for bread. Barley : Only differentiation is “ black ” and “ white.” Grains are so mixed as to be almost impossible to identify a particular species as a crop. Both crops have suffered much from the seeds being mixed, and from the excessive amount of foreign grain and weeds. Bice is grown extensively on the Hor ibn Najm, three varieties, nafimah and huwaizawi and ‘ambar, being produced. Dukhn is the most extensive summer crop, both harfi and ‘afli crops being sown. On a lesser scale, simsim, mash idrah baidhah, and lubyah are also cultivated. Idrah safrah is not cultivated, and inquiries elicited the information that it had been tried years ago, but was always attacked by a small worm in the stalks, which ruined the crop. It is hoped to carry out some experiments this season. An experiment in potato cultivation was a failure owing to the seed potatoes being found to have mostly decayed in transit. Vegetables and melons are extensively cultivated, principally on river beds at low water, and by waterlifts. Irrigation Pumps. —There are 26 oil pumps in the district, mostly on the Shatt al Hillah. All of these had fallen into disuse during the war, and most of them had been robbed of essential working parts. A mechanic’s shop was set up, with three mechanics, under the supervision of the A.P.O., and a stock of spare parts was obtained from Baghdad for sale to owners. Seven machines were repaired in time for summer crops; and, an E. &amp; M. Section Officer having recently arrived at Hillah and inspected here, several more which required more extensive repairs will soon be available. Fourteen are now running for this season’s winter crops. Oil tanks have been erected and oil is distributed to cultivators as required. It is greatly to be hoped that experiments with agricultural machinery will be possible in the district this season. A simple form of reaper is much to be desired, as crops suffer from inability to reap sufficiently quickly after ripening of the grain. An agricultural calendar is given in Appendix B. 5. Municipalities. —Previous to our occupation of the district, Diwaniyah, alone of the towns, possessed a Baladiyah. During the year Baladiyahs have been formed at Dagharah, Qahat Haji Mukhif and ‘Afaj. The amount of work to be done is limited by the labour available, the small amount of existing skilled labour being nearly all required for public works and irrigation. Diwaniyah.—On taking over the district in April, the A.P.O. found the municipal safe depleted of cash, and a debt of Rs. 400/- due to political funds. There was little to be seen to justify expenditure, and funds had been swallowed up in the salaries of unnecessary officials. After an average monthly expenditure on improvements of Rs. 900/-, the funds now stand Rs. 4,500/- to the good. Improvements effected comprise construction of public latrines and dustbins sweeping of roads and removal of house refuse, construction of pavements in the streets, paving of the bazaar, building of a retaining wall to river front, with steps to the river, lighting of the town and bazaar, levelling and draining of roads, building of a sanitary slaughter-house, construction of municipal stables, and other minor improvements. The former title given to Diwaniyah, “ Mother of refuse ” is no longer applicable, and the inhabitants have begun to take a laudable pride in the cleanliness of the town. rDagharah, QaVat Haji Mukhif and ‘Afaj .—The new Baladiyahs formed have done excellent work. By Faz^s of the neighbouring tribes, immense pits in the streets of all three towns, formerly full of foul water, have been filled in. At QaFat Haji Mukhif and ‘Afaj, they were particularly bad. At the latter place, pits covered nearly two acres of ground and were in places 20 feet deep, earth having been taken for building purposes for years past. At Dagharah and QaTat Haji Mukhif the river front has been repaired and bridges over canals constructed within municipal limits. At ‘Afaj a river front, 1,500 yards in length and 8 to 10 yards wide, was made, thus saving the town, which was rapidly being destroyed by the river. Masonry steps to the water have been built. In all three municipalities, lighting and sanitation have been undertaken, new roads made, and existing roads repaired and widened. Brick kilns have been built, and bricks will shortly be available for construction of permanent public latrines, paving of bazaars and re-roofing, which is essential. The inhabitants have co-operated in effecting improvements, and now fully recognise the benefits of sanitation. A table showing municipal establishments and average incomes is given in Appendix C. 6 . Judicial. —The inhabitants increasingly resort to Government for redress in cases of debt, land and water disputes, &amp;c. Petitions dealt with now vary from 500-800 monthly. Official Shi‘ah ‘Alims have been appointed at Diwaniyah and ‘Afaj, and are of great assistance in dealing with cases under Shara‘ law, reporting their decisions to the A.P.O. A proposal for appointment of an ‘Alim at Dagharah is being submitted. The maximum punishment of death had to be inflicted in three cases of cold blooded murder. A considerable number of murder cases have been disposed of by Fasl, under tribal law. The crime of homicide was appallingly frequent, and the A.P.O. was granted the powers of a Military Governor, by the Civil Commissioner, to enable him to deal with the situation. Fortunately, with the exception of the three cases mentioned, death sentences have not been necessary, and in the past few months there has beeji a marked decrease in serious crime. One serious case only of highway robbery has taken place in the past six months, and the offenders were arrested and dealt with. Several small tribal fights, resulting in one or two deaths, have taken place; but it has always been possible by early intervention to stop the affair after the first outbreak, and no serious fighting has taken place since A.pril last. In spite of the fact that small camps of troops have been distributed about the district, getting in the harvest, no case of interference with troops or thefts from camps has been reported, though thefts of Government grain by Mahailah men and others have been frequent, and the offenders generally brought to book. 7. Education. —A boys’ school has been opened in Diwaniyah wdth staff of four masters, and over 200 pupils are now attending. A school for small girls has just been started, and is proving successful. Arrangements are being made for elementary technical instruction in carpentry and building. The inhabitants of Dagharah and ‘Afaj have applied for educational facilities, and a proposal is being submitted for orders. Inhabitants report a marked improvement in the health of children since the inauguration of the school. A sick parade is held daily, and ailing childien are sent to the Dispensary for treatment. 8 . Medical. —A Civil Dispensary was opened in July, and an average of 80-90 out-patients attend daily. A considerable number of minor operations have taken place, and a few in-patients are taken. The need for a whole-time Civil Surgeon, who could visit Dagharah and ‘Afaj, is great; and it is hoped that one may be avail able in the coming year. A mild form of cholera ran through the district m August, and a large number of deaths occurred. The epidemic reached Diwaniyah, but prompt measures were taken by the M.O. i an isolation hospital was established and all cases and known contacts removed, and houses disinfected. Deaths in Diwaniyah numbered 19 Small-pox was rampant in August and September, and infant mortality, particularly among the tribes, was very high. Owing to the requirements of the Army, it was impossible to obtain lymph to vaccinate. The tribes and townspeople a: IO 1162—1 P206 are anxious for vaccination of children, and it is hoped that an ample supply of lymph may be forthcoming shortly. 9. Police.-— The Police force, raised as a temporary measure in 1917 by the Arab Agent, was found to contain a number of bad characters, who had to be gradually eliminated. The force has now been reorganised as Shabanah, and proposals as to strength and future organisation submitted for approval. Recruits are coming in satisfactorily, and drills have been started. The men are happy and pleased with their work; but it is essential that discipline should be inculcated slowly, as the tribes are still nervous of anything approaching Military service. The Shabanah are already very usefully carrying out the work required of them. 10. Labour.— Demands for labour for military purposes have fortunately been light. Labour for irrigation work can be provided by Faza‘ of tribes, provided the season be chosen so as not to seriously impede Cultivation. Skilled labour for build ings, bridges, &amp;c., is very scarce. 11 . Miscellaneous : Treasury. — The Irrigation Department has hitherto drawn its cash requirements from the Military Paymaster and, owing to Revenue having been collected in kind, cash receipts have not been great. The F.T.C.O. is likely to be removed shortly, and Revenue receipts are likely to be approximately 20-25 lakhs of rupees. The establishment of a Civil Treasury mil shortly be a necessity. Buildings .—The Government Sarai at Dagharah has been rebuilt, and a political house is in process of construction at ‘Afaj. A small rest house at Qakat Haji Mukhif has been sanctioned for the use of touring officers. 12 . Establishment and Personnel.— Owing to the continued increase of work, it has been necessary to expand the establishment from time to time. B.O.s .—An assistant to the A.P.O. was appointed in October. Owing to the opening up of ‘Afaj, and particularly the rapid expansion of A1 Budair, it is essential that an officer should be stationed at ‘Afaj shortly, and it will in all probability be necessary for a second assistant to be appointed to Headquarters of the district. The revival of the Fawar and Shafa‘iyah lands, the prospective advent of the railway, and new irrigation projects, will very greatly increase the area under cultivation and work of the district. Without an Officer at Headquarters, it is impossible for the A.P.O. to devote the time to touring which, in a large tribal, agricultural district, is essential. Capt. C. K. Daly, I.A., was in charge from April 1918 till the close of the year. Capt. Chaning Pearce, A.P.O., was appointed assistant to the A.P.O. in September, and proceeded on force leave in December, being relieved'by Capt. Webb. Personnel: (a) Political Office.—The office staff consists of— 1 Head Clerk. 1 Despatch Clerk. 1 Accountant. 4 Arab Clerks. A second general clerk and typewriter is urgently required. (b) Revenue.—The Revenue establishment is shown in Appendix D It will very shortly be necessary to form a separate Shu‘bah for A1 Budair, and Fawai bbu bah will require an increased establishment as soon as the canal is completed It is estimated that Revenue work will increase to nearly double its presenl amount with the schemes to be carried out in the ensuing year. Both the Political and the Revenue staffs have been heavily worked, particular^ durmg the past six months, and have, with few exceptions, done excellent service. C. K. Daly, Capt.

Political and Tribal : ( 1 ) Shifathah .—Is a large oasis situated about 30 miles west of Karbala in the desert. It is watered by three large and nine small springs, which are slightly sulphurous, but good for purposes of drinking and cultivation. Shifathah consists of a large date grove, containing about 281,500 trees in bearing and about 57,500 trees not in bearing. In addition, there are estimated to be 31,000 fruit trees in bearing. The inhabitants of Shifathah are estimated to consist of about 8,000 souls in all; they do not belong to any particular tribe, being merely known as the people of Shifathah. , (2) Rahhaliyah.—Is a similar but smaller oasis to Shifathah, from which it lies about 25 miles north-west. It is watered by five springs of a similar quality to those at Shifathah. It contains 42,600 date-trees in bearing and 6,000 trees not yet in bearing. Fruit trees number 1,969. The inhabitants number about 1,000 souls, of whom about 160 belong to a small tribe called the A1 Bu Shibil. (3) Until October 1918, these two places were administered by a muclir under orders of the Political Officer, Desert. They are at present being administered from Karbala. ( 4 ) The people are indifferently armed with obsolete rifles. They are at present law-abiding, and have given no trouble. (5) Shifathah and Rahhaliyah exist chiefly by selling their date crops to the ‘Anizah and the Dulaim. Previously these places were not self-supporting in the matter of cereals, but this year it is hoped that sufficient grain has been sown to render them independent of outside assistance. ( 6 ) As far as one can judge after having been in charge of this district for just under one month, it is efficiently run by the Mudir in charge, who appears to be an energetic and capable man. 2. Revenue: Land Revenue. —(1) The major portion of the land is derived from the date crop. Each date-tree in bearing in Shifathah pays 2 annas 3 pies, and in Rahhaliyah 4 annas. It is estimated that in 1918 this will amount in the case of— Rs. As. P. Shifathah to - - - - - 35,447 8 0 Rahhaliyah, date-trees - 10,652 0 0 These amounts have not yet been collected, but will probably be received before the end of December 1918. (2) The taxes on fruit trees are expected to yield- Rs. As. P. For Rahhaliyah - - 61 7 6 For Shifathah - - 875 0 0 (3) The land revenue paid on account of one -fifth share of the miri for Shifathah is— As. Rs. P.

Irrigation and Agriculture. —The irrigation in Shifathah and Rahhaliyah is entirely in the hands of the people themselves, and is all by direct flow from the various springs, none of the irrigation being by lift. This year the people are being encouraged to sow more wheat and barley, by which means it is hoped that they will become independent of imports from outside. 4. Shabanah.— The Shabanah in Shifathah number 22, 2 mounted and 20 foot; and in Rahhaliyah, 7 foot Shabanah. They perform the duties of police and patrol the district and gardens in the interests of general security. 5. Judicial.— The administration of justice and the settlement of disputes is in the hands of the Mudir, who reports that no cases of importance have occurred, and that the people are easy to deal with.

Administration Report for the Dulaim Division for 1918. 1. Political and Tribal.— Only recently has the whole of the Dulaim Division come under our administration. At the commencement of the year our advanced troops were just up-stream of Ramadi, facing the Turks in Hit, while in between was no man’s land. The occupation of Hit on 9th March 1918 was followed by the battle of Khan Baghdadi on 26th March 1918, and the pursuit of the Turks to ‘Anah and beyond, and our administration was extended to the Wadi Mu‘aliyah (T.C. 146A.DD 36 a.c.), the boundary of the Turkish nahiyah of Hit. The Turks re-occupied ‘Anah towards the end of April; but, although our advanced troops were not above Sahiliyah, no difficulty was found in administering the area in front of our line. In fact the inhabitants from Jubbah and ‘Alus were continually coming in and asking to have their cases tried and settled by the Assistant Political Officer at Hit. Some it was found possible to deal with, but a number, necessitating recovering from tribes not under our control, had to be left, as Nijris al Qa‘ud, the hostile Shaikh of the Albu Nimr, was encamped below Hadithah and the Wadi Mffialiyah was found to be the limit of safety for any action by Shabanahs. On 6 th October 1918 the Turks left ‘Anah and the inhabitants of ‘Anah coming down river reported that the town was anxiously awaiting our arrival. On 31st October 1918, attended by L.A.M., cars, and a tribal escort under three of the leading Dulaim Shaikhs, a Political Officer established himself in ‘Anah without interference or opposition, and to the great relief of the population. The Shaikhs of the local tribes came ip to see him at once, and Nijris al Qa‘ud, who had fled into the desert, sent to ask under what terms he might be allowed in. Shortly after Al Qaim was visited, and the occupation of the Dulaim Division was completed. The main portion of the inhabitants belong to the large group of tribes of Zubaid stock from which the Division takes its name. The Dulaim, however, are not united under one Shaikh. The confederation can be split into eight main sections :— Section. ■ . - Shaikh. (1) Albu ‘Alwan - - - Jasim al Muhammad, Muhannah al Muhammad. (2) Albu Dhiyab - - - Mushin ibn Hardan, Shaukah ibn Mutlaq. (3) Albu Fahad - - - Abdul Jabbar al Bishar. (4) Albu Tsa - - - - Harat al Jasim. (5) Al Jumailah - - - ‘Abbas al Jassam. ( 6 ) Al Muhamdah - - - Habib al Shallal. (7) Albu Nimr - - Fahad al Hillal, Nijris al Qa‘ud. ( 8 ) Albu Rudaini - - - ‘Ali ibn Sulaiman. Of these sections, the Albu Tsa and Al Jumailah are not Dulaim by race. In. addition there are several subsections who have broken away and whose shaikhs have become entirely independent. The largest tribe in the Division not connected with Dulaim are the Zoba‘ (Shammar) who, united under Dhari ibn Dhahir, cultivate the lands watered by the Abu Ghuraib and Radhwaniyah Canals. In addition there are various extraneous tribes, but most of these are dependent. A peculiarity of the Division are the non-tribal communities of Anah, Hadithah, ‘Alus, Jubbah, and Hit. Q ?212 The inhabitants have date gardens which are mulk, in the vicinity of these various towns and live in dread of the surrounding tribes. Finally the inhabitants of the desert town of Kubaisah, dependent on a few springs and their lucrative trade with Arabia, claim to be made up of the following tribes :— Tribe. Shaikh. ( 1 ) Diriyah (2) Albu Hamad and Bait Kamal (3) Albu Haidar - (4) Mathuthah (5) Haji Tsa ( 6 ) Bait Farajullah Faraj ‘Abdullah. Muhammad al Ahmad al Shuwaikh. ’Abdul Razaq al Hajji Muhammad (Sa‘id). Kassar al Shawwaf. Sa‘ud al Haji Najm. Humaiyid al Khusaib. They have no tribal characteristics and it is more in keeping when they claim to be Bani Kubaisah. • At the time of writing the northern boundary line runs from a point on the left bank of the Euphrates, in the vicinity of Abu Kamal (T.C. 146 DD 35 c.) in an E.N.E. direction, curving round to meet the boundary of the Samarra Division. Then, running southwards, its eastern boundary marches first with the Samarra and later with the Baghdad Divisions. Until the Saklawiyah Canal is reached at Imam Ibrahim al ‘Ali (T.C. 99B. AE 35 D 8 / 8 ) the boundaries have not yet been defined. From this point until the river is reached again, the boundary, starting from Imam Ibrahim al ‘Ali, runs in direct line to Tak Tsa (T.C. 99 square AE 57A 9/9), and thence, following the ancient canal line southwards to a point (AE 77A 3/7), turns eastwards about half a mile along the same old canal to junction with Bisaitin (AE 87 a. 8/0). Thence south-eastwards along a pathway to masonry bridge (T.C. 102B W 2 b 8 / 6 ), and onwards to Tak Muhawwish point 134 (W. 3c. 10/1), Tah Muchari point 5 R. (W. 20 b 3/5), Tali Dubbiyah (W. 21 c. 7/1), besides the old Decauville railway embankment, where it touches the Hillah Division boundary for the first time. Note. —Reference maps for Divisional boundaries :—T.C. 210—4 miles, 1 inch; T.C. 99 B —2 miles, 1 inch; T.C. 102B—2 miles, 1 inch. From Tal Dubbiyah the boundary running S.W. along the railway embankment to Kushuk'(W. 28 D 8 / 8 ) turns westward along the faintly-marked channel running into the old Radhwaniyah Canal at (W 28 A 4/1), and continuing westwards along the Canal to a point south of Imam Hamzah (W 28 c 8/2), joins the river at (W 28 c 7/1). Grossing to the right bank where the high ground approaches the river (T.C. 102 B W 41 6 / 0 ) it proceeds, no longer defined in a W.S.W. direction, to approximately Rahiliyah (inclusive), where, turning N.W., it leaves the Hillah Division and, bounded only by the desert, strikes the river again in the vicinity of Abu Kamal. Fqr administrative purposes the Division is split into the districts of— ‘Anah, Hit, Ramadi, and Fallujah. Kubaisah is under an Arab Government Agent responsible to the headquarters of the Division at Ramadi. The ‘Anah district extends from the northern limits of the Division to the Wadi Mu‘aliyah (T.C. 146A. DD 36 a.c.). On its northern confines are the ‘Aqaidat, whose Shaikh Mushin ibn Muhammad Dundun lives at Abu Kama!. This tribe is on friendly terms with their nearest neighbours down-stream, the Albu Mahal, cultivators in the neighbourhood of Al Qaim (T.C. 210 c. A 47). Note. —Reference maps :—T.C. 210—4 miles = 1 inch; T.C. 146A^—4 miles = 1 inch; T.G. 144—4 miles = 1 inch. The last-named tribe, who are a subsection of the Albu Rudaini, are the chief tribe in the Anah district. Their Shaikh, ‘Aftan ibn Sharqi, is now independent. They are part cultivators, but also own very large flocks of sheep and a certain number of camels.213 •&gt; The only other tribes that cultivate at all in this district are the A1 MaTadhid A1 Laghar - A1 Jaghaif - Albu Haiyat Albu Ghanam On the left bank in the vicinity of Susah. On the left bank. On the right bank. On the right bank. On the right bank. All these tribes are alien, but follow Dulaim Shaikhs. Until the fall of Ramadi they turned to Shaikh ‘Ali ibn Sulaiman, but from that time until ‘Anah was occupied he has been out of touch with them, and consequently they have fallen away from their allegiance. They are mostly nomadic sheep-breeders, and only a very small portion of them cultivate. The remainder of the population in the district is non-tribal. Until recently the whole of the district below ‘Anah lay between our advanced troops and the Turks, consequently the district suffered and a large portion of the population drifted down-stream into our lines for safety and work. This has also affected the trend of tribal feeling, ‘Aftan ibn Sharqi being in the Turkish area and Nijris al Qa‘ud of the Albu Nimr, who openly sided with the Turks, naturally feel sore against the Shaikhs lower down the river who submitted to us on the occupation of Ramadi and benefitted accordingly. The Hit district, which extends southward of the ‘Anah district to the Wadi Suwaib (T.C. 146A. DD 61 a.), on the left bank and to the Wadi Muhammadi (T.C. 146A. DD 61 c. d.) on the right bank, is peculiar in that it is entirely non-tribal. The conditions prevailing of non-tribal mulk holdings are very similar to those in the southern portion of the ‘Anah district and the advisability of extending its boundaries northwards to include Hadithah might be considered. The Ramadi district is entirely Dulaim, stretching from the Hit district to the north of the Saqlawiyah Canal on the left bank and on the right bank to Sinn al Dhibban (T.C. 144B 20 c.). Between the Wadi Suwaib and the Saqlawiyah on the Jazirah are the cultivators of the Albu Nimr and the Albu Dhiyab, separated by the Albu ‘Assaf, a subsection of the Albu Rudaini. All the subsections up-river of the line AA on the tribal map acknowledge Shaukah ibn Mutlaq of the Albu Muhammad al Dhiyab, except the Albu Ali al Jasim and the Albu ‘Assaf. In addition, Shaukah controls the Albu Farraj (‘Azzah) and Albu Mijbil (Wa‘idh) extraneous tribes. The heads of the two sub-sections of the Albu Nimr, the Albu Hillah and Albu Hamad al Husain, are Ikhtiyars of Shaukah, but the sheep and camel-breeders of these two sections still turn to Nijris al Qa‘ud as their Shaikh. Fahad al Hillal, who set up as Shaikh of the Albu Nimr and claimed to be able to control the whole of the tribe, has failed miserably and there are signs that even his sub-sections, the Albu Hamid al Husain, are getting tired of his incapacity. Perhaps when Nijris is properly chastised he may be prepared to return to his former allegiance to Shaukah. Below the line “ A ” already mentioned, Mushin al Hardan controls the tribes to the Saklawiyah as well as the Albu ‘Ali al Jasim. , On the right bank from the Wadi Muhammadi down-stream to Sinn al Dhibban extend the cultivators of various sections of the Albu Rudaini, Albu ‘Assaf and Albu ‘Alwan. All these turn to Ali ibn Sulaiman. This Shaikh controls by far the largest portion of the Dulaim and has considerable influence with the other independent Shaikhs of the Dulaim. This completes the Ramadi district and the Fallujah district extends to the Southern boundaries of the Division. Below the mouth of the Saklawiyah Canal to Fallujah and across to the Saklawiyah and for a shortd istance below Sinn al Dhibban on the right bank, are the Muhamdah under Habib al Shillal. Between the Muhamdah on the left bank and the Zoba* lay the Jumailah under ‘Abbas al Jassam. On the right bank are the remaining large section of the Dulaim, the Albu Tsa extending down stream to the limits of the Division and to the Jannabiyin. The 'remaining large tribe in this district are the Zoba‘ under the Shaikhship of Dhari ibn Dhahir. This in the course of time has absorbed a few settled sections of other tribes of extraneous origin, such as the Albu Sodah, Hitawiyin and the Qaraghul (Dulaim) and the Al Haib (Jubur). X 10 1162—1 Q 3214 The dispositions and numbers of the chief Zobah sections are as follows :— Name of Section. Total Strength. Situation and Remarks. Hitawiyin - 250 On Euphrates left bank down-stream of the Abu Ghurait canal. Shiti - - . - 200 Down-stream of the Hitawivin. Sa‘adan 900 Cultivating portions of the Abu Ghuraib and Radhwaniyah canals and the Euphrates left bank. Kurushiyin 800 Cultivating portions of the Abu Ghuraib and Radhwaniyah canals. Falluj iyin - 150 Cultivating left bank Euphrates down-stream of Kurushiyin. Chadadah (including 500 Left bank of the Euphrates for the remainder of the Qurtan). district. This section was formerly much stronger, but most of them have moved away out of Falluj ah district to cultivate the new Yusufivah. Shuwartan 150 All these sections cultivate the upper reaches of the Sumailat - 150 Saqlawiyah canal in that portion called the Gurmah and Bani Zaid - 150 Abadi. A1 Haib - 350 A1 Hamam 250 Various other minor sections, of less than 100 persons each, mingled among the above larger sections, are the A1 Fayadh, Albu Sodah, Qaraghul, Ghuraibawin, Subaihat, Quwaidat and Harasah, totalling about 450 persons all told. ' Total of the Zoba‘ in Fallujah district, 4,300 all told. Full details of the various sub-sections of the Dulaim can be obtained from the tribal list of the tribes of Baghdad wilayat issued by the Arab Bureau. A tribal map is attached giving the position of the cultivators of the various sections of tribes in the Division and the Divisional and District boundaries. The various sections of the tribes have settled down quietly as they came under our administration in a way which shows that they prefer ordered government and justice, if they can depend on it, rather than lawlessness. Nowhere in the Division is there friction between the tribes or intertribal fighting. During the year the intertribal boundary between the Zoba c and Bani Tamin in the Duwairtan lands has been demarkated in the presence of a majlis composed of Shaikhs of both tribes. The result has been to do away with a former cause of friction between the tribes. Counter claims for sheep raiding between the ‘Anizah and the Albu Murai, a subsection of the Albu Rudaini, have been settled amicably. The ‘Aqaidat asked for assistance to settle their outstanding feud with the ‘Anizah and this was easily arranged. More and more are the tribes realising that the rulings of the British Government are just and peaceable. Negotiation under Government supervision is now generally sought after. For long, certain sections of the Dulaim have been renowned for their thieving and it is difficult to eradicate an acquired habit in a short time. Thefts have been oi fiequent occurrence from the camps. Adequate steps, however, have been taken to show the thieves that it does .not pay in the long run. 1 nci o is still a tendency on the part of the Shaikhs to shirk their responsibility in assisting to maintain law and order; but, in proportion as they realise that the Government demands are just and for the benefit of the community as a whole, so they exert a greater measure of their influence with their tribes. The cultivators are beginning to lose their suspicion that Government is only prepared to take and give nothing in exchange. On the whole, looking back through the year, the tribes have been favourably impressed and they are gradually placing their confidence in Government. It only remains in the future to see that they have no cause to think their confidence has been misplaced. 2 . Re\ enue . (A) Land ItEvcnua. — From the most Northerly point of the Division to where the hills fall away, from the river Euphrates just below Hit, so far as investigation has shown, the majority of the cultivated land is tapu and the chief source of land revenue is that derived irom date-trees, fruit trees, vegetables and a certain quantity of shitwi and saifi crops.i or shitwi crops in this stretch more wheat is sown than barley, the proportions being f to Below Hit the hills recede from the river and from here onwards extends the main corn-growing district. The whole of the Ramadi district is “ miri ” except the ‘Aziziyah (Tash) Canal and the lands dependent thereon, which is a Sanniyah estate. The Fallujah district is also miri, with the exception of the two large canals of the Abu Ghuraib and that portion of the Saqlawiyah Canal called the Qurmah (i.e., that eastwards of Raufat Shammar (T.C. 100 B, 817d), where the canal bends), which are Sanniyah land and the Radhwaniyah Canal, which is tapu, together with most of the land on the right bank of the Euphrates which is also tapu. ‘Anah. —The land taxes are collected as follows :— Winter karads.—294 huggas wheat; 94 huggas barley. Summer karads.—Crops are estimated and taken at the rate of one in 10 on shitwi and saifi sown on land watered solely by rain or flow water ; the tax is 1/10 taken by estimation. The collection on a baqrah is half for winter crops and estimated in a similar fashion to karads for the summer crops. Na'urs. —Na'urs are reckoned as baqrahs. There are two exceptions, however :— (1) A baqrah is reckoned to water 14 donums. If the na‘ur waters either very much more or very much less, the tax is adjusted by estimation. (2) If a na‘ur waters palm-trees with crops among them, the crops are taxed by estimation. There were 228 na‘urs and 259 baqrahs working in the district last saifi, but this number will be very largely increased with settled Government aid with the advances of grain which have been sanctioned this winter. Date-trees are taxed at 4.1 annas on each fruit-bearing tree. Other fruit trees are taxed at 1 anna. Wood Tar .—The tax on wood brought in from miri land is one-fifth and on that from tapu one-tenth. Hit. —In this district all saifi and shitwi crops are estimated, Government taking one-tenth. There is no fixed assessment for na‘urs in this district, due to the fact that only very few are used solely for cultivating grain crops. When a new na‘ur is built date-trees are planted at once. The tax collected this year on date-trees was 4 annas a bearing tree. No tax is collected on other fruit trees, but Government takes one-tenth of the sum realised on all sales of vegetables and fruit from the gardens. No wood tax is collected at present, as there is practically a fuel famine in the district. Full information of the land revenue of Ramadi and Fallujah districts is contained in the Land Revenue Notes issued by the Revenue Board. Kodak realised a sum of only just over Rs. 45,000. This was partially due to the diminished number of sheep through the requirements of the Force, and to an unfavourable year due to drought, but also to the fact that a large portion of the grazing grounds of the tribes around the Wadi Hauran on the Shamiyah side and Wadi Tharthar on the Jazirah side were not in our control and the kodah collection had to be done through tribal mamurs. There should be a large increase in the coming year. No difficulty has been encountered in the collection of land taxes from either the shitwi or saifi crops. In the Hit and Ramadi districts collection has been completed and in the Fallujah district the saifi collection has been completed and the outstanding demands on the shitwi are small. Ramadi. —The rice crops on the Tash lands were a failure owing to the drying up of the ‘Aziziyah Canal; but this has been cleared and was opened on 10th November 1918 in time for the shitwi sowing. In addition a number of new karads have been erected on the river. Fallujah. —The Abu Ghuraib Canal was only opened in January of this year, far too late to derive the greatest advantage from it. Winter crops also suffered from lack of earlv rain. *216 The summer crops suffered from the exceptionally low level of the Euphrates. Further, the Saqlawiyah was bunded and no sweet water w r as allowed in. The prospects in the Division for the coming year, however, are hopeful and everything points to a large increase in the land revenue. (B) Tapu. —A Mamur Tapu was appointed to the Division at the end of October. Up to date he has been engaged in the verification of existing tapu deeds of the house properties of Ramadi and Eallujah. The whole of the cultivators in ‘Anah and Hit districts claim that their land is tapu and the coming year it should be possible to verify this. In Ramadi district, except for house properties in the Ramadi towm, there is no tapu. In Fallujah district there is very little tapu, w r ith the exception of the following estates mentioned below-. These are the tapu estates of Hassai, Nassaf, ‘Amriyah Muwailiyah, all on the right bank of the Euphrates, extending nearly the whole length of the district, and owned by the Bait Kuyumjian, an Armenian family. The Radhwaniyah estate, owned by Salim Zaibaq, Pachahji and Co., on the left bank all along the Radhwaniyah Canal. Salim Zaibaq also owns ‘Ujair, Batrah and Buzaibis on the right bank. Two small tapu properties cultivated by the Albu ‘Alwan and Halabsah on the right bank where marked on the accompanying map. Jubail, owned by Isma‘il Effendi on the left bank below T Fallujah. Kharab, owned by Hasan Beg, on the left bank below r Fallujah, and the estate of Mahmud Shahbandar (prisoner of w r ar), rented to Mohammad Said of Fallujah at Rs. 2,000 per annum. This is the Abu Sudairah estate. (C) Waqf. —All Waqf throughout the Division is Sunni. The only district in which there is no waqf is Ramadi. 'Anah. —There is waqf land at Hadithah, Jubbah and ‘Anah. Up to date it has not been possible to find out the exact revenues derived from these lands. At present, after Government has taken the usual taxes, the Imams of the various mosques take what is left as their right and carry out any necessary repairs to the mosques. Further investigation is required. Hit. —Waqf property consists of one house and 10 shops and a portion of a date garden. It is too early yet to say whether the revenues will be sufficient to meet the salaries of the waqf establishment and cover incidental expenditures and the necessary repairs to the mosque. Ramadi. —At the present time the mosque is being re-built by public subscriptions and, when completed, should be a very fine structure. Fallujah. —The revenues derived from shop property, a large ambar and coffee shop, bring in a monthly rental of Rs. 142/- to Rs. 167/-. The pay of the establishment only amounts to Rs. 45/-. So that Fallujah waqf is entirely self-supporting and leaves a good margin of profit over for repairs and upkeep to the mosque, which is in a very good state of repair. (D) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues. —Petition stamps realise from Rs. 70/- to Rs. 100/- per month. The profits derived from the fish tax in Fallujah, Ramadi and Hit are small. The fish tax in the ‘Anah district appears to be more profitable, as from the beginning of January to the end of March, the Wadi Haqlan (T.C. 146 (A) DD a.b.) is full of fish, possibly owing to the hot spring which runs into the river here. The most profitable miscellaneous source of revenue is from the lime and bitumen in the Hit district. The taxes collected are :— Bitumen - - - - - Rs. 2/8 per ton. Lime - - - - . - Rs. 1/8 „ The average monthly receipts at present are between Rs. 2,500 to 3,000. No revenue has been derived from salt this year, and, run on Turkish lines, this would not be a profitable ‘source of income. There are, however, three large sources of salt. Government property, from which, at a later date, it maybe possible to derive revenue :— {a) Two days’ journey into the Jazirah from ‘Anah. ( 6 ) The salt pans in the vicinity of Hit. (c) The salt deposits in the vicinitv of Umm Rahal (T.C. 1464. DD 39 DD. 40).(E) Customs. -Customs duties were collected earlier in the y&amp;ar on imports of tobacco, but after the prohibition of future direct imports and the diversion of this traffic to Baghdad customs receipts ceased. There are no other sources of customs at present. (F) Compensation. All claims for compensation in the Division have been small, which is noteworthy considering that military operations have taken place on a large scale and speaks well for the troops taking part in the operations. All claims have been investigated with despatch and the rapiditv with which all just claims have been settled has had a good political effect. 3. Irrigation. There have been three noteworthy irrigation works carried out in the Dulaim Division during the past year. Ramadi.- The ‘Aziziyah Canal has been deepened by tribal labour and a regulator built near the mouth. This has opened up the whole of the Tash flow lands, which are all Sanniyah, for cultivation. With the Habbaniyah Lake at its present low level, a large area is available for cultivation; but how much will be available if the lake is used as a storage reservoir is not certain. The ‘Aziziyah Canal was reopened on the 10th of November 1918. Fallujah .—The existing Abu Ghuraib Canal has been thoroughly cleared out and, where necessary, levelled and deepened. It is an important canal, watering a considerable area both in Fallujah, Kadhimain and Baghdad districts. The land it feeds is Sanniyah land, and consequently it is highly remunerative to keep the canal in good repair. The Turks had not excavated it well, and in places rock outcrops had to be removed to keep the level. Its present condition is infinitely better than it has ever been before. This fact is fully realised by the local inhabitants. The work has been carried out free by tribal labour supplied almost entirely by the Zoba‘ in Fallujah district. These did not need much pressure to keep them on the work, and worked very well throughout. The canal was opened on the 25th November, ensuring ample time for this winter’s crops’ cultivation. The second and largest scheme has been the cutting of a large, deep-feeder channel from the Euphrates in T.C. 100B, square s. 34 central, to the depression running into the old Saqlawiyah Canal, N.E. of it. This will bring the Saqlawiyah Canal into cultivation again, eventually making it capable of watering 250,000 acres of remarkably rich soil, 40,000 acres of which will be perennial. Tribal holdings are shown on the attached map. The feeder channel is a fine piece of work, and the Saqlawiyah will be one of the largest canals opened in ‘Iraq this year. The labour supplied has been entirely tribal, composed of the tribes actually intending to cultivate from the canal. These are the Jumailah (who have continually supplied their full share of labour and have done the lion’s share of the excavation), the Zoba‘, the Halabsah and the Muhamdah. At the present time the area of irrigated land in the Division is sufficient for the whole population. 4. Agriculture.— Agriculture in that part of the Division which was in our occupation at the beginning of this year was hampered by scarcity of early rain during the winter and by an abnormally low river-level during the summer. Owing to the proximity to the Turkish lines little encouragement could be given to the cultivators in the forward areas. The price of all grains in the Turkish area was far higher than that prevailing in our lines and there was a great temptation to the tribal cultivators to run grain through up-stream to get the better price. The seed advances issued last year proved a failure, either because the seed was eaten and not planted or was poor. This year the plan has been adopted of providing seed for sale. During the past year the Arabs have earned plenty of money and most of them are in a position to purchase their seed requirements. Mention has been made that the Euphrates emerges from the hills just below Hit. From the northern boundary to this point the only flat river plain suitable for planting cereals is in the vicinity of Al Qaim. Through the remainder of the gorge the river is flanked by narrow strips of none too fertile soil, varying in breadth from ten to three or four hundred yards. The river running through this gorge varies its course very little from year to year. The bed is rock and the current more rapid than in the lower reaches.218 These three factors have rendered possible the planting of date gardens watered from the large waterwheels, called na‘urs, with their masonry supports and long arched stone aqueducts, and their dams reaching out across the river and nearly meeting in the centre. The initial outlay on one of these na‘urs and the length of time it takes to develop a date garden account for the large amount of non-tribal cultivation in this reach of the river. There is no doubt that in time, with settled government, the number of trees in this area can be increased tenfold. In the date gardens, fruit trees of every description have been grown; but they were ruthlessly cut down by the Turks. Those that have died, however, have been replaced and in a few years fruit should again become common. Once out of this gorge, the hills recede and the river wanders through a more open plain; owing, however, to it continually shifting its bed, date gardens are not common, but the remainder of the Division, as far as agriculture is concerned, is entirely a grain-growing area. Luckily, the occupation of ‘Anah came at a time when it was still possible to extend facilities for cultivation of the shitwi crops. Early rains, increasing confidence, and improved irrigation have all helped to improve the prospects for next year. The readiness with which engines for irrigation are applied for is encouraging showing the readiness of the Arab cultivator to realise the value and superiority of agricultural machinery over old methods. Including the engines already working in the Division, applications have been received for 17 additional ones. The Government farms throughout the Division have been an unqualified success, and, when the time comes for them to be discontinued, there will be no difficulty in getting ready bidders for them among the local inhabitants. 5. Municipalities. —There are nine municipalities in this Division, of which five are in the ’Anah district and have only been recently occupied. The table below shows the district in which they are situated and the approximate population at present and approximate number of houses and shops as far as they are known :— District. Town. Population. House. Shop. ‘Anah - - - - ‘Anah . . . Rawah - Hadithah ‘Alus . . . 7,000 400 Hit - - - - Hit ... 5,600 625 84 Ramadi Ramadi - 3,200 300 120 Ful lu j ah Fullujah 2,000 180 80 Saqlawiyah 400 50 20 Anah. In the short time that the five towns in the ‘Anah district have been in our possession it has been possible to do little more than clean them. Of these, Anah is by far the largest, but of late the population has greatly decreased. Of no depth, it struggles along about 5 miles of the right bank of the river. Above it rise the cliffs of the higher desert. Under the hills and behind the town runs the main high road. Parallel runs one long narrow lane through the length of the town. At present baladiyah taxes are collected from Paswaniyah, butchery fees, ferry tolls and a baladiyah tax on all imported wood. The town is divided into eight mahallahs, each under a mukhtar, and each mahallah consists of people of same origin. Opposite the town are many islands planted with date-trees and along the right bank stretch date and vegetable gardens, all the property of the inhabitants. Raw ah is a small town of crooked lanes on the left bank. The inhabitants are more enterprising as traders and own date gardens on the left bank, extending up to near A1 Qaim. Both these municipalities should be quite solvent.Hadithah, Jubbah, 'Alus .—All these communities are of the same type. Their villages are on islands and they cultivate the island and the river banks facing them. The people are purely agriculturists and carry on no bazaar trade with the tribes. The population of all these towns is much reduced at the present time and it is not possible at present to estimate what the baladiyah receipts will be when normal conditions return. With regard to the remaining towns in the Division, as there was considerable variation in the taxes collected by the different baladiyahs, sanction was obtained to co-ordinate them and the following taxes have now been fixed:— Bridge Toll- Sheep - - - - - - i anna. Loaded donkey - Unloaded ,, Loaded horse, cow, or camel - Unloaded ,, ,, ,, - Ferry— Men - Sheep - Donkey Horse - Cow Camel - Load - Camel load Paswaniyah— Houses Shops - Weighing Fee— Per load Ardhiyah— Per load Butchery— Sheep,large - 4 , small - Cattle, large - ,, small - Camel - 8 as., 3 as. by assessment. Rs. 1/8 and II- by assess ment. 1 anna. 6 „ 3 „ Re. |. 9 annas. Rs. 1/14. Maidaniyah— 2 | per cent. Also in Hit special tax for contractors using foreshore for slaking lime, 2 annas. The baladiyah of Hit is quite prosperous, with a balance of Rs. 4,754/- after eight months’ occupation. The chief industries are the lime and bitumen and, in addition, the inhabitants own large date and vegetable gardens. Ramadi .—At the present time has only a balance of Rs. 1,246/-. Owing to the fact that the ferry tolls are no longer credited to the baladiyah a grant-m-aid of Rs. 70/- monthlv has been sanctioned. Its finance will have to be watched carefully in the future if it is to remain solvent. It has a large bazaar, which is gradually extending and supplies the needs of the surrounding tn es ’ Saqlawiyah is a small village lying well back from the river. Its financial position is satisfactory and at present has a credit balance of over Rs. 900/ . Fallujah is singularly prosperous for so small a town, with a present credit balance of Rs. 5,500. The market is prosperous and the town is, if anything, overcrowded. In time this town should increase in size. 6 Judicial —There has been little judicial work of importance. On the whole the inhabitants of the Division are law-abiding and there have been no cases of outstanding interest. Petty thefts or non-payment of debts, which require little Owin' to the tribal preponderance in the Division, a large number of the petty cases are referred to the leading Shaikhs, who deal with them according to tribal custom and report their findings for confirmation.220 Sari‘ah courts have been opened with a qadhi at Ramadi and naib-qadhis in. the districts and all matters that come within their scope are referred to them. Their findings are also referred for confirmation. 7. Education.— A municipal elementary school has been opened at Ramadi and from 50 to 60 boys attend. It is a start, but properly trained teachers are badly required. The inhabitants of both Fallujah and Hit have also asked to have schools, but any idea of opening them has had to be temporarily abandoned owing to the teacher question. In the meantime in these two towns the local mudarris teach a certain number to read and write. There is a strong feeling that the schools should be free, based chiefly on the fact that the schools were free in Turkish times. 8. Medical and Sanitation.— Civil dispensaries have been opened in Hit, Ram adi and Fallujah. The services of a Medical Officer or a Sub-Assistant Surgeon are lent by the A.D.M.S., 15th Division, and the dispensaries and attendants are supplied by the Civil Administration. In addition to the treatment of minor ailments, a considerable amount of vaccination has been carried out. As well as having a good effect politically, they have been very useful in reporting the outbreak of any epidemic. This has made it possible to take quick measure to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Each of these towns is provided with a sanitary section supervised by a British rank. In Fallujah and Ramadi refuse is incinerated; but in Hit, owing to the value of the refuse as manure to the garden owners, arrangements have been made to sell it to them—garden owners being responsible for its quick removal. Public latrines have been built in the towns and fines are taken in all cases of public nuisance. Householders of obviously dirty houses are also fined. In the bazaars measures are taken to see that all food that attracts flics is properly covered and the inside of the shops are kept clean. It cannot be expected that in such a short time the inhabitants should understand the necessity of cleanliness as a preventive of disease, but there is no doubt that they appreciate a clean town. 9. Police.— During the period that the blockade was all important, the town police were abolished and their work was performed by shabanahs. This was necessary so that there should not be two distinct bodies engaged on the same work. As the necessity for the blockade ceases, the question of re-establishing the town police as distinct from the shabanahs will have to be considered. 10 . Shabanahs.— In July, foot and mounted shabanahs were organised and given uniforms. The police of Hit, Ramadi and Fallujah formed nucleus for the foot shabanahs. B.O.R.s were obtained as instructors and in a very short time a promising shabanah force was developed. By means of the shabanahs it was possible to enforce a rigorous blockade, and the reports received from outside the occupied area on the decrease in blockade running were most encouraging. Necessity dictated that the force should be used at once with very little training and some control was, therefore, required when sending them out to enforce orders. The custom of always sending a trustworthy B.O.R. with them has proved a success and has done a lot to steady them up. It has also helped to teach the N.C.O.s their responsibilities. In the intervals, training has gone on steadily, and in October it was found possible to take over certain military guards. ... an Assistant Political Officer was appointed in charge of shabanahs, and in the near future the various bodies at present working direct under the orders of A.P.O.s should be linked together into a combined force tor use m any portion of the Division. The following military guards have been taken over : Fallujah - - _ ?? - - - Railway police Khan Nuqtah Muhammad Sa‘id Radhwaniyah Abu Ghuraib - - Sirriyah Bund.' Survey Party, Hadithah. . — - Supply Depot. - Railway station. - Dhibban. - Railway stations. - Anbars.They have also been of the greatest assistance both during and after the occupation of 4 Anah and as convoy guards on the road between ‘Anah and Hit. At the present time the Shabanah strength is :— — Arab Officers. j Mounted. Foot. Sanctioned - 1 142 105 Actual - 1 112 86 11. Labour. —In a Division where the population is hardly sufficient to meet the needs of agriculture, the demands for labour sometimes have been difficult to meet. For the last tw r o or three months, however, all labour required for military purposes has been forthcoming and from between 1,500 to 2,500 coolies have been continually employed. The tribes have been called on to excavate canals and to repair roads passing through their lands. At one time the tribes were finding daily :— On the ‘Aziziyah Canal - - - - 700 Saqlawdyah Canal _ . - - 500-800 Abu Ghuraib - - - 500-600 Owing to the increased cultivation, however, unless the labour demands decrease in the coming year, difficulty will be encountered in meeting them. 12. Miscellaneous. —The signing of the Armistice and the relaxation of the various restrictions on the local inhabitants were a source of great satisfaction, and the resultant increased activity in trade, followed by an all-round reduction of prices, has added to their satisfaction. 13. Establishment and Personal. —Revised lists of establishments suitable now and for post-bellum staff are being considered throughout the Division. There has been no difficulty in getting Arab establishment, but considerable difficulty has been experienced in finding men suitable for responsible positions of trust. (Signed) L. M. Yetts, Captain. For Political Officer.222 Administration Report for the Fallujah District for 1918. 1. Political and Tribal.— The tribes of the Fallujah district fall naturally under two heads, the Zoba‘ and the Dulaim; the Zoba‘ being of Shammar origin. The Zoba‘ are united under the Shaikhship of Shaikh Dhari Ibn Dhahir, and have also, in the course of time, absorbed a few small cultivating and settled sections of other tribes. Thus there appear sections of extraneous origin, such as the Albu Sodah, the Hitawiyin, the Qaraghul (Dulaim), and the A1 Haib (Jubur), mingled among the real Zoba‘ sections, and under Shaikh Dhari’s influence. The A1 Haib is the only large section of these, and has latterly shown a tendency to become independent of the Zoba‘. It is expedient, however, to keep them under Shaikh Dhari, for the present at all events, as they are cultivating in Zoba‘ land, and are only a small and isolated section of the Jubbur. The Zoba‘ sections are all situated on the left bank of the Euphrates, on the Abu Ghuraib and Radhwaniyah Canals, and on the upper reaches of the Saqlawiyah Canal. None of them are found on the right bank of the Euphrates. The Dulaim tribesmen in Fallujah district are not united, as are the Zoba 4 , under a single Shaikh. Although they acknowledge Shaikh ‘Ali Sulaiman as the ultimate Shaikh of the Dulaim, they are grouped under the virtually independent Shaikhs of the large Dulaim sections of the Jumailah, the Albu ‘Isa, and the Muhamdah, and a smaller section of the Dulaim, the Halabsah. By far the largest of these is the Albu Ts^i tribe, containing various subdivisions and occupying nearly the whole of the right bank of the Euphrates in the Fallujah district as far as the desert. These are under Shaikh Harat, now a very old man, but enjoying a wide reputation as a good Shaikh. His work is now mostly carried on by his son, ‘Aifan, who appears capable. The Albu Tsa are some 3,500 strong, and also comprise several sheep grazing sections. A small section of the Dulaim, some 250 strong, cultivate property on the right bank opposite Abu Faiyadh. These are the Albu ‘Alwan. The next largest Dulaim section, after the Albu Tsa, is the Jumailah, some 2,500 strong, of whom about 200 cultivate the right bank opposite the head of the Abu Ghuraib Canal. The Jumailah are under Shaikh ‘Abbas al Jassam, a pleasant, extremely capable, and energetic elderly man, with a strong hold on his tribe. The Jumailah, besides the section on the right bank, cultivate along the mouth of the Abu Ghuraib Canal, and a wide portion of the Saqlawiyah Canal. They have supplied the best labour in the excavation of the new feeder channel into the old Saqlawiyah Canal, which work was accomplished this year. The Muhamadah, some 2,400 strong, are the third largest Dulaim section in the district. Three hundred of them, the Fulaihat section, cultivate the right bank down-stream of Sinn al Dhibban. The remainder, comprising the Albu Shijal, the Albu ‘Adham, Al Musalhah, Albu ‘Akash, and Al Shihah, cultivate the left bank, between the old mouth of the Saqlawiyah Canal and Fallujah, also the portion of the Saqlawiyah Canal from the mouth to Raufat Shammar, where a section of the Baqarah, forming part of the Muhamdah, cultivate the North bank. The Shaikh of the Muhamdah is Shaikh Habib al Shallal, a well-meaning Shaikh, but poor, and consequently with rather a weak hold on his tribe. It is possible that the opening up of the Saqlawiyah Canal will improve his circumstances and his prestige. The Halabsah are the small Dulaim section cultivating the North bank of the Saqlawiyah Canal between the Zoba and the Jumailah. A portion of them, 100 strong, cultivate part of the right bank down-stream of the Albu ‘Alwan. The Halabsah are about 800 strong, all told. Their Shaikh is Shaikh ‘Abdullah al Muhammad al Dhahir. the dispositions of the sections and the boundaries of the tribal groups are shown on the accompanying map. . oaa he t J otal j strell g th of the Zoba‘ in Fallujah district under Shaikh Dhari is about 4,300. A reduction in the numbers of the Zoba' in Fallujah district was effected when most of the strong Zoba section of the Chadadah were moved from the Radhwaniyah Canal out of Fallujah district on to the more favourable cultivation ot the Yusufiyah, excavated this year in Musaiyib district.The dispositions and numbers of the chief Zoba c sections are as follows :— Name of Section. Total Strength. Situation and Remarks. 1 Hitawiyin 250 On Euphrates left bank down-stream of the Abu Ghurab canal. Shiti 200 Down-stream of the Hitawiyin. Sa’adan - 900 Cultivating portions of the Abu Ghuraib and Radhwaniyah canals and the Euphrates left bank. Kurushiyin - 800 Cultivating portions of the Abu Ghuraib and Radhwaniyah canals. Falujiyin 150 Cultivating left bank Euphrates down-stream of the Kuru- shijin. Chadadah (including 500 Left bank of the Euphrates for the remainder of the district, Qurtan). * This section was formerly much stronger, but most of them have moved away out of Fallujah district to cultivate the new Yusufiyah. Shuwartan 150 All these sections cultivate the upper reaches of the Saqlawiyah Sumailat 150 canal in that portion called the Qurmah and ‘Abadi. Bani Zaid 150 A1 Haib - 350 A1 Haman 250 Various other minor sections, of less than 100 persons each, mingled among the above larger sections, are the A1 Fayadh, Albu Sodah, Qaraghul, Ghuraibawin, Subaihat, Quwaidat, and Hurusah, totalling about 450 persons all told. Total of the Zoba‘ in Fallujah district, 4,300 all told. The conduct of the tribes has been so peaceful, both towards each other and towards the British administration, that it is hardly deserving of comment. A former cause of considerable friction and intertribal fighting between the Zoba‘ and the Bani Tamim regarding the. intertribal (and consequently interdistrict) boundary of the Duwairtan lands, was removed in April this year by a redelimi tation of the boundary in question in the presence of a majlis composed of shaikhs of both tribes. They were admittedly unable to come to a peaceful understanding themselves, and welcomed the arbitration of the Government. A definite boundary, based on clear natural features of the ground, was drawn up and sanads were taken acknowledging and ratifying it. Both parties were relieved at the solution of the problem which for years past had rendered cultivation in the Duwairtan lands unsafe for either tribe. It is generally recognised that the rulings of the British Government are just, and peaceable negotiation under Government supervision is now generally sought after. A tribal majlis assembled by order of Government for the solution of intertribal difficulties carries considerable weight. The large number of petitions received daily for the restitution of property in petty cases of theft is also a sign of reliance on English justice. In short, the tribes welcome the British occupation and appear ready to cultivate and improve their circumstances as peaceably as they can. Thefts from camp have been of frequent occurrence. The habit of ages cannot be eradicated in a short time. Fines have been inflicted on the tribes nearest to the camps, and the few thieves caught have been suitably punished, though without appreciable effect. It remains to be seen whether increasing prosperity will stop theft by removing the necessity for it. In brief, reviewing the political situation, the tribes have been favourably impressed by the efforts Government has made to improve cultivation. They have been impressed by the good treatment they have received fiom the army of occupation. They have been impressed by the accessibility of justice, and also its fairness as compared with the old regime. They appreciate payment of compensation for damage done through unavoid able causes, and they appreciate ready payment for labour or supplies. They contrast the old regime with ours, and are satisfied. The boundaries of Fallujah district, defined by T. C. map references, are attached herewith separately. Page (5). Boundaries of Fallujah District.—The following T. C. Map references describe the boundaries of the Fallujah district as recently corrected and biought up to date. The cultivation of the Saqlawiyah canal and the Mahmudiyah or \ usufiyah canal224 has caused a few minor alterations, and last spring it became necessary to deliminate a definite boundary between the Zoba s and the Bani Tamin, to put an end to intertribal fighting regarding the rights of cultivation in the Duwairthan, which for years past both had contested. The line of the Saqlawiyah canal has been given' as the northern boundary of Fallujah, but in reality the boundary will have to become dependent on the limit of the land cultivated from the Saqlawiyah. The tribes on both banks are those from this district, and it will be simplest to keep them under Fallujah. Left Bank Boundary.— Reierence T. C. 100 B.

The sketch-map showing tribal boundaries submitted with the report is reduced from the T.C. maps mentioned. 2. Revenue : (a) Land Revenue .—Fallujah district is miri land, with the exception of the two large canals of the Abu Ghuraib and that portion of the Saqlawiyah canal called the Qurmah {i.e., that eastwards of Rauf at Shammar in T.C. map 100 B square S 17 D, where the canal bends), which are sanniyah land, the Radhwaniyah canal, which is tapu, and most of the right bank land, w T hich is also tapu. The miri and tapu lands pay one-fifth of the total produce to Government, while the Sanniyah, as usual, pays two-fifths. As regards karads in sanniyah land, they pay at a fixed assessment of Rs. 25 and 500 huqqahs of wheat and 500 huqqahs of barley each karad. From summer crops of sanniyah karads Government takes a fixed assessment of Rs. 12— 8 , and 500 huqqahs of whatever crop is grown, convertible into cash. Other karads pay on a fixed assessment of Rs. 20 and 500 kilos (not huqqahs as in sanniyah land) of wheat and 500 kilos of barley. Abu Sudairah tapu is worthy of mention as an exception. This pays only one-tenth to Government, instead of the usual fifth. This is in the tapu sanad and dates from the time of giving the tapu, the reason being that the ground is rather high and was considered too poor to pay the usual fifth to Government. The land revenue was promptly paid this year, with very few exceptions of delayed payment, but has suffered from the unfavourable conditions prevailing. Regarding the Abu Ghuraib canal, this was only opened in January for last winter crop—far too late a date to derive the greatest advantage from it. In addition to this the district was still suffering from war conditions and scarcity, while there was insufficient rain at the proper time to assist the cultivation and the' crops. Last winter’s crop was according^ below the average for the district. Summer crops suffered from the exceptionally low level of the Euphrates The floods on the Tigris did not communicate themselves correspondingly to the Euphrates, and while the Tigris had a short severe flood, the Euphrates suffered from a paucity of water.225 Kodah, in spite of ^ the diminished number of sheep—due to the requirements of the Force, which seriously depleted the available stock last year (1917), and the unfavourable yeai that last year was for sheep, owing to the drought—has reached a satisfactory figure through careful collection, and has realised in Fallujah district, on camels, buffaloes, and sheep, a sum of over 35,000 rupees. Land revenue (from fixed assessments and conversion into cash of summer crops share) has already realised over 59,000 rupees, and is not yet finished. Last winter’s crops brought in a total of over 1,400 tons of barley and over 230 tons of wheat. As already stated, it was an unusually unfavourable season for winter and summer crops, and, with the assistance of the Saqlawiyah canal, newly opened, and the excellent excavation of the existing Abu Ghuraib canal, it is probable that these figures will be doubled in the coming year. (b) Tapu. There is very little tapu in the Fallujah district, with the exception of the following estates mentioned below. These are the tapu estates of Hassai, Nassaf, ‘Amriyah, Muwailhah, all on the right bank of the Euphrates, extending nearly the whole length of the district, and owned by the Bait Kuyumjian, an Armenian family. The Radhwaniyah estate, owned by Salim Zaibaq, Pachahji and Co., on the left bank all along the Radhwaniyah canal. Salim Zaibaq also owns ‘Ujair, Batrah, and Buzaibis on the right bank. Two small tapu properties cultivated by the Albu ‘Alwan and Halabsah on the right bank, where marked on the accompanying map. Jubail, owned by Ismail Effendi on the left bank below Fallujah. Kharab, owned by Hasan Beg on the left bank below Fallujah; and the estate of Mahmud Shahbandar (prisoner of war), rented to Muhammad Sa‘id of Fallujah at Rs. 2,000 per annum. This is the Abu Sudairah estate already mentioned. The Radhwaniyah property has undergone considerable changes since last year. The canal, being unfavourable, has not again been excavated this year, and accordingly most of the Chadadah tribe have moved away to cultivate the newly opened up Yusufiyah canal in Musaiyib district. As this is also largely in the property of the Radhwaniyah Company, the change is decidedly profitable to them. Tapu registration, or rather verification, of existing tapu deeds, has been recently commenced. (c) Waqf .—Fallujah contains a well-built mosque on the river front. The waqf endowment is Sunni waqi, and is employed for the upkeep of the mosque and waqf buildings, and payment of the salaries of the mudarris and mosque servants, etc. The waqf comprises rent-paying property of shops and a large ambar, and a coffee-house, bringing in a monthly rental of from Rs. 142 to Rs. 167. The pay of the establishment only amounts to Rs. 45 monthly; so that the Fallujah waqf is entirely self-supporting, and leaves a good margin of profit over for repairs and upkeep. (d) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues .—Petition stamps realise from. Rs. 100- 250 per month. The Fallujah fish tax is farmed, and brings in a total of about Rs. 450 per annum. There are practically no other small sources of revenue, except taxes on jus burning, etc. (e) Customs .—Customs duties were collected earlier in the year on imports of tobacco into Fallujah district, but, after the prohibition of future direct imports into Fallujah and the diversion of this traffic to Baghdad, customs receipts ceased, Over 3,300 rupees were, previous to the above orders, collected in Fallujah on importations of tobacco. There are no other sources of customs at present. (/) Compensation .—Claims for compensation have not been numerous during the past year. In May 1918 it became necessary to assess compensation payable on account of damages caused to crops by the construction of the railway to Sinn al Dhibban, and the formation of railhead camp there. Twelve cultivators were affected, and compensation paid amounted to Rs. 3,536/14/-. The only other case was compensation paid on account of inability to cultivate shitwi and saifi crops on a small plot of land ( 1 | bal::as tapu) owing to its occupation by the camp at Shaikh Habib. Compensation was paid amounting to Rs. 225. x IO 1162—1 R226 The few claims for compensation point strongly to the good behaviour of the large number of troops encamped in the district. In each case where compensation has been claimed, the damage has been caused by military necessity, never by wilfulness or neglect. The payment of compensation where damage has unavoidably been caused has a political effect strongly favourable to us. 3. Irrigation.— There have been two noteworthy irrigation works carried out in Fallujah district during the past year. Firstly, the existing Abu Ghuraib Canal (shown on the accompanying map) has been thoroughly cleaned out and, where necessary, levelled and deepened. It is an important canal, watering a considerable area both in Fallujah, Kadhimain and Baghdad districts. The land it feeds is sanniyah land, and consequently it is highly remunerative to keep the canal in good repair. The Turks had not excavated it well, and in places rock outcrops had to be removed to keep the level. Its present condition is infinitely better than it has even been before. This fact is fully realised by the local inhabitants. The work has been carried out free by tribal labour supplied almost entirely by the Zoba‘ in Fallujah district. These did not need much pressure to keep them on the work, and worked very well throughout. The canal was opened on the 25th November, ensuring ample time for this winter crop’s cultivation. The second and largest scheme has been the cutting of a large, deep, feeder channel from the Euphrates in T.C. 100 B square S 34 central to the depression running into the old Saqlawiyah canal N.E. of it. This will bring the Saqlawiyah canal into cultivation again, eventually making it capable of watering 250,000 acres of remarkably rich soil, 40,000 acres of which will be perennial. Tribal holdings are shown on the attached map. The feeder channel is a fine piece of work, and the Saqlawiyah will be one of the largest canals opened in ‘Iraq this year. The labour supplied has been entirely tribal, composed of the tribes actually intending to cultivate from the canal. These are the Jumailah (who have continually supplied their full share of labour and have done the lion’s share of the excavations), the Zoba‘, the Halabsah, and the Muhamdah. Work had to be stopped entirely for a whole month owing to two sharp outbreaks of cholera occurring consecutively among the labour, dispersing it each time; and finally the epidemic of Spanish influenza, which stopped work for a fortnight. Political pressure was throughout necessary to keep the tribal labour supplied up to full numbers, and several fines had to be inflicted. At the conclusion of the work, however, enthusiasm increased, and labour worked well to open up the canal and depart to cultivate it. Irrigation in this district is now sufficient to supply every Arab with cultivation. Consequently, the available supply of paid labour and of organised Arab labour for military requirements will tend to decrease. In various instances owners of property are now unable to cultivate the whole of it for lack of fallahs, who naturally prefer to cultivate their own land if they can get any. In short, the area of irrigated land is now fully sufficient for the whole population of this district. 4. Agriculture.- Agriculture in the Fallujah district during the past year has been hampered by scarcity of rain during the winter and by an abnormally low river-level during the summer. Winter and summer crops accordingly suffered. Nevertheless, Government received from the winter crops over 1,420 tons of barley and over 230 tons of wheat, and the cash equivalent for over 330 tons of summer crops. With the assistance of the Saqlawiyah Canal and favourable weather and water-level, the produce of the district should be nearly double the above figures. I he w heat advances issued last year or early this year were a complete failure and total remission was necessarily granted. The seed may have been poor or, being Indian seed, the cultivators did not water it at the right time. Advances of barley seed w^ere mostly recovered at cash conversion rates of Rs. 240/- per ton. Cash advances were a success. The plan adopted this year of issuing no advances, but providing grain for sale as seed at reasonable prices, is quite the most practical and the simplest to supervise, and guards Government from possible loss through misuse of advances of seed and consequent petitions for remissions, tallujah district has apparentlv sufficient seed grain, and no advances on cash payment have been asked for. The improvement of the gram and food situation this year, compared to that prevailing at the same time last year (when the district was suffering severely from the effects of the war and when great scarcity prevailed), is very marked. The readiness with which engines for irrigation are applied for and purchased by the local inhabitants is encouraging, showing the readiness of the Arab cultivator to realise the value and superiority of agricultural machinery over old methods. Including that of the Shaikh Habib grass farm, there are already six pumping engines situated in the district, while six more have already been applied for through Govern ment. Two more are also being privately obtained by the Bait Kuyumjian estate. There should be a profitable future for agricultural machinery in this country. Regarding Government farms, the Fallujah vegetable farm has been an unqualified success, supplying vegetables to the greater part of the division. The Shaikh Habib grass farm has been extremely successful, but may possibly be discontinued soon. In this event, it is hoped to sell the engine and farm as it stands to a local inhabitant willing to take it over. Bids have already been received. The provision of an oil depot at Fallujah for agricultural and civil purposes has been a great convenience compared with the old method of transporting oil fuel from Baghdad by road under private arrangements. 5. Municipalities.— The two municipalities in the district are Fallujah and Saqlawiyah; Fallujah being a small town with a population of 2,000, and Saqlawiyah being a village of some 400 inhabitants. Both baladiyahs are in reality self-supporting, but the Sinn al Dhibban bridge toll, formerly credited in Saqlawiyah baladiyah funds, has recently been credited to Military Estimates, and a grant in aid of the same value has now been credited to Saqlawiyah monthly to replace the deficit. In Saqlawiyah the taxes are collected under the Rais Baladiyah from ardhiyah, paswaniyah, butchery fees, &amp;c. The financial position of Saqlawiyah baladiyah is satisfactory, showing a credit balance at present of well over Rs. 900. In Fallujah the taxes are farmed as regards the following :—ferry toll, ardhiyah, butchery fees, weighing fees, maidaniyah, and paswaniyah, at favourable prices, while supervision renders it impossible for the tax collectors to charge more than their dues. The Fallujah Baladiyah also possesses shops whose rentals bring in Rs. 112/- per month. The Baladiyah is singularly self-supporting and prosperous for so small a town, the monthly receipts being roughly Rs. 1,000/- and the expenditure roughly Rs. 500/-. The present credit balance of the Fallujah Baladiyah funds is well over Rs. 5,500/-. The market is prosperous and the town is, if anything, overcrowded. Govern ment-owned buildings of a suitable pattern, to be rented to the local inhabitants, would be an immediately remunerative and beneficial investment to expend baladiyah funds upon, when these funds increase somewhat. 6. Judicial. —Judicial work here this year calls for very little comment. The inhabitants of the district have been singularly law-abiding on the whole. As already mentioned, cases of theft from camps are of frequent occurrence, but thieves are seldom arrested. The inhabitants continually bring forward petitions claiming restitution of property appropriated by others (some of these cases having long histories), and these cases are comparatively easily settled. No serious cases have been tried during the past year. As already stated elsewhere, it is noticeable that the local inhabitants realise the benefits they reap through living under a strong Government with easily- accessible justice. 7. Education. —The question of starting a boys’ school in Fallujah was referred to the Education Directorate this year, but had to be temporarily abandoned owing to the impossibility of obtaining a properly-trained teacher. In the meantime, reading and writing in Arabic is carried on under the local mudarris. It is hoped that a Government school will be started at the earliest possible date next year. 8. Medical and Sanitation. —The civil dispensary is here, as apparently everywhere else, of great benefit to the local inhabitants, especially the townsfolk actually living on the spot, though the tribes frequently send in persons for treatment.228 Patients as “ in-cases” cannot of course as yet be accepted; but by dressing wounds, by minor surgical treatment, by issuing medicines, and by vaccination and inoculation, very good work is done. An outbreak of small-pox this year (1918) in January was suitably dealt with by the vaccination of unprotected inhabitants and the isolation of the cases in a special isolation camp. The services of a medical officer or an Assistant Surgeon are lent by the Division to carry on the duties of O.C. Civil Dispensary. The dispensary and the attendant are supplied by the Civil Administration. The sanitary section, Fallujah, consists of one British private i/c Sanitary Section, eight sweepers, one sweeper and donkey, and two Turkish carts. Fallujah sanitation during the past year has been satisfactory. Public incinerators and latrines have been built, ruined buildings have been pulled down, and roads have been improved. Fines have been taken from house holders of obviously dirty houses as a commencement towards ensuring that cleanliness shall be observed inside as well as outside houses. Spanish influenza was very severe in this district, a high rate of mortality prevailing among the Arabs. In the town mortality was not so severe, but quite 70 per cent, of the population were incapacitated with the complaint at one time or another during the epidemic. 9. Police. —Police have now been abolished throughout the district, their duties being performed by shabanahs. Night watchmen in Fallujah and Saqlawiyah perform part of the old duties of the Baladiyah Police. 10. Shabanahs. —The foot and mounted shabanahs in Fallujah district were organised as such and given uniforms in July 1918. The previous Fallujah foot police formed the nucleus of the new foot shabanahs, while the un-uniformed mounted shabanahs, formerly employed at Abu Ghuraib and Radhwaniyah anbars, formed the nucleus of the mounted shabanah force. B.O.R.s were obtained as instructors, and from raw material a promising shabanah force has developed. The foot shabanahs, being longest at headquarters, have made the best progress, and are distinctly smart. Various military guards have already been taken over by shabanahs. The guards over the Fallujah Supplies Depot, the Fallujah railway station, and railway police duty at Dhibban, have been taken over by the foot shabanahs. The Khan Nuqtah, Muhammad Sa‘id, Ghuraib Road railway station guards have all been taken over by mounted shabanahs. Mounted shabanahs also supply the usual guards on anbars at Radhwaniyah and Abu Ghuraib. The shabanahs were of the greatest assistance in maintaining the blockade while it was in force. All blockade posts in Fallujah were supplied from the foot shabanahs, while posts and patrols of mounted shabanahs along the Saqlawiyah Canal (a favourite former route for smuggling) and along the entire river frontage of the district checked unauthorised exports of food or goods to the enemy. The rapidly enhanced prices in Mosul, which came into being soon after the shabanahs were put out on these posts, are the best comment on the efficiency of their work. By the sale of confiscated goods alone which they captured the shabanahs may be said to have paid for their upkeep. On the occasion of the escape of three German prisoners of war and an Indian interpreter from Advanced Base, the Fallujah shabanahs detected the attempt of this small party to escape across our frontier and arrested them. The foot shabanahs now consist of 1 chaush and 22 foot shabanahs. The mounted shabanahs consist of 5 chaushes and 62 mounted shabanahs. 11. Labour.— A large amount of labour, considering the population, is supplied from this district, as the following figures will show :— Dhibban Camp—Arab labour daily supplied - - - 600 Roads - 15 Q Fallujah, including labour supplied to ambars and at Khan Nuqtah railway station 150 Total - - 900 Ihe above labour is permanently in use and, in addition to it, large demands had to be made on tribes to excavate canals or to repair roads passing near their lands.The tribal labour employed in the excavation of the Abu Ghuraib Canal numbered over 500, mostly supphed by the Zoba‘ of this district. The numbers at the excavation of the Saqlawiyah Canal were, after pressure was applied, between 500 and 800 daily. To expedite the completion of the works final tasks were allotted and, after their completion, tribal labour was allowed to depart to the cultivation of their lands on the canal. For further remarks upon the subject of labour, please see para. (3) Irrigation. The supply of labour has been satisfactory during the past year, but with increasing cultivation it is possible that the available supply of paid daily labour may diminish. 12. Miscellaneous. —The ‘Anizah were encamped on the right bank of the Euphrates downstream of Fallujah for the greater part of the summer. Under orders from the Political Officer, Dulaim, a long outstanding series of claims and counter claims for raids and sheep thefts was finally settled at Fallujah between the ‘Anizah and the Albu Murai‘ section of the Dulaim, previous to the departure of the ‘Anizah. The announcement of the Armistice was gladly received by the local population, as also w T as the abolition of the old blockade restrictions, which, though necessary, were naturally irksome to merchants. 13. Establishment and Personnel. —Revised lists of establishments con sidered suitable both now and for a post-war staff have been submitted to the Political Officer for his information. Good work has been done by all branches, especially the Revenue establishment under the Mai Mudir. The district has quite recovered from the effects of the war, and the various branches of the establishment are now satisfactorily trained and used to their work. J. O’Sullivan, Captain I.A., A.P.O., Fallujah.230 Administrative Report for Hit District for the Year 1918. 1. Political and Tribal. —On our occupation of Hit in March the town was found to be dirtier even than most towns in the province of Iraq, and provided a parallel in this respect to the town of Mosul, which fell months later. Cultivation had almost completely ceased, land lay fallow, and trade was at a standstill. This was due more to the ravages of the Turkish soldiery as they passed through, than to the conditions brought about by war. What had once been a flourishing industrial town and the centre of important trades, became a city of the dead, and what had been before a district producing such valuable fruit as apricots, peaches, apples, and pears, was found on our entry to be a barren, untilled region in which little was produced beyond wheat, barley, and rice in small quantities. There is little tribal work to be done in the area. The Albu Nimr inhabit the left bank of the Euphrates river (the so-called “ Jazirah ”). Nijris al Qa‘ud of this tribe has given some trouble by paying periodical visits into the district and organising looting parties. But after obstinately refusing to come in for several months, though the defeat of the Turks was obvious, he has at length surrendered and is now with the Political Officer at ‘Anab. His future area of overlordship is in course of settlement. 2. Revenue : (a) Land Revenue .—This has come in fairly well, and no particular dissatisfaction has been felt. (b) Tapu .—The tapu situation has not yet been investigated in Hit district. (c) Waqf .—One house and ten shops are owned and five pieces of land which are ‘uqr. There is one garden ‘(Mulhaqah Auqaf), but no agricultural land. The revenue is small and not sufficient even to meet the salaries of the Waqf establishment, though the shop rentals were increased in September. 3. Irrigation.— The whole of the cultivation is irrigated in the district by lift. Waterwheels (na‘urs), which first appear at Hit, are here built at intervals of from 500 to 600 yards along the bank. Several, however, are out of action, chiefly owing to the lack of wood, and if oil engines are not soon available steps should be taken to repair these. The cost of construction of a waterwdieel is about Rs. 400/-, though in Turkish times the cost was as low T as Rs. 150/-. Where wood is scarce there is, therefore, a considerable initial outlay and the efficiency of the waterwheel is not such as entirely to justify the expenditure. Some of the cultivators are specially keen on the introduction of the oil engine, and any hesitation there is in coming forward with demands is attributable in part to the uncertainty as to who will look after them when once they have been installed. But supervision should not be difficult, since one engineer could keep an eye on a large number. The Euphrates is navigable for anything larger than shahturs only up to Hit, though Turkish launches have gone up higher. When the river is in flood, navigation is difficult and uncertain even up to Hit, owing to the presence of the weirs which lead the water to the waterwheels, and information has been received that shahturs cannot proceed beyond Hadithah when the river is at its highest; but this is no doubt without foundation, for the draught of a shahtur is only about 22 inches when laden and 6 inches when empty. 4. Agricultural.— The cultivation in the district consists of a series of narrow strips lining the river bank up-stream as far as Wadi MiTaliyah and down-stream as far as Wadi Muhammadi and Wadi Suwaib. These strips vary from 10 yards to 600 or 700. With the introduction of the oil engine and its greater power these should broaden out, and the area fit for cultivation should increase. The soil is not exceptionally good, though it appears pre-eminently suited to such fruits as the apricot, pear, apple, orange, bitter lime, citron, grape, fig and plum. Before the war these grew in abundance, but the trees were ruthlessly cut down and the wood used as fuel by the Turks, as they passed through. Hence little of this fruit is now produced. But the cultivators are particularly keen on obtaining cuttings or slips with a view to their re-introduction and this desire is in every way to be encouraged. A letter on the subject has already been despatched to theproper authorities, but, so far, no very definite promises have been made. Every effort should be made to get up the cuttings and it is to be hoped that we shall not be without them when the season arrives for planting (spring). The main crops grown are barley, wheat, dukhn, lucerne, rice, adds, hartaman, sesame (or simsim). Dates appear to thrive and large quantities are exported into places both inside and outside the Dulaim area. At the last date count the following figures were obtained :— Bearing trees - - - - - - 35,584 Fruitless, but of a bearing age - - - -10,014 But many have since been planted. The vegetable crops have not come up to expectation, and it has been difficult to supply the needs of the troops, even though every inducement was offered to the landowners. An interesting experiment is being made at the time of writing with the co-operation of the 15th Division. Two professional gardeners have been lent for a week or two to give the land-owner some idea of how his fruit trees should be pruned and looked after. A majlis of .all the land-owners in the district was assembled, pamphlets on the diseases of the dates were read out, and other advice given. A practical demonstration was then given. A Hitawi, who appeared especially keen, allowed his garden to be divided into two portions, of which one was given over to the care of the two gardeners. ‘ They are now working hard at pruning and trimming the trees, and it is hoped that next season the difference in the crops (both quantity and quality) will be evident to all. In places, stretching out from the bank to the middle of the river, may be seen the ruins of old mills which were used in times past to grind the corn for the Baladiyah. These might be rebuilt, but it is hoped that more modern methods will be introduced in a short time. One or two attempts have been made to get the cultivators to manure their land and to remove the litter from the camps in the neighbourhood for this purpose. At Hit the suggestion has not been too eagerly carried out, owing to the distance of the camps from the gardens and the consequent cost of transport, though at Sahiliyah, where troops were nearer, the plan met with more success. Before and since our occupation there was a considerable shortage of plough cattle, and this deficiency was made up to some extent by bullocks purchased from Government in Baghdad. . . . „ For further notes under this heading vide “ Agricultural Report—Hit District, forwarded to Revenue, Baghdad, under my No. 1643 of 26th September 1918. 5. Baladiyah. —On our entry into Hit the town was perhaps one of the filthiest in the province of ‘Iraq. It was, therefore, difficult in the first place to make a beginning. So many schemes seemed of prime importance. But the matter upon which attention was immediately concentrated was the provision of suitable latrines for the use of the population. After plans had been made and estimates drawn up, it was decided that the best form of latrines would be a series of square brick-built enclosures. These were accordingly constructed and contracts were made for the removal of the fsscal matter. This has been, on the whole, faiily well carried out. A butchery was then constructed and butchery tax collected, the number of sweepers employed formerly by the Turks for tne Baladiyah were added to, and during the last month sanction has been obtained for a further increase. The streets in Hit are exceptionally narrow owing to the large number of houses and the smallness of the baladiyah site. It has been, and still is, a matter of con siderable difficulty to keep filth from accumulating and stenches from appearing. One great advantage, however, is that the streets are paved throughout with bitumen, and this most effectively prevents the accumulation of stagnant and dirty water. A sanitary orderly was lent by the 50th Brigade in May, and, although this orderly has been changed several times, most of them have done good work in assisting in the abolition of insanitary conditions. But a lot remains still to be done, and sanitation schemes are more difficult of accomplishment than in most towns as a result of the narrowness of the streets, the reeking bituminous atmosphere from the neighbouring bitumen kilns, and the general state of decay manifest throughout the town It is, in fact, an almost hopeless task, and the only real remedy appears to be the razing of the present site of the town to the ground and the erection of a larger and cleaner one outside. T . Lamps have been provided for all the streets. Houses have been numbered and the streets named.232 A Baladiyah majlis assembles weekly under the chairmanship of the Rais al Baladiyah, though, so far, no particularly valuable suggestions have been put forward. The population at the time of the last census (September 1918) amounted approximately to 5,000, but there is reason to think that this is an underestimate, raison d'etre of the census is still considered as the impulse to our work in this direction—estimation of army figures. The last assessment of property in the town showed that there were :— A Civil Dispensary was opened in June. The difficulty has been all along to get people to attend it, and it is unfortunate that the majority of the Arabs who come up for treatment, even now, are the halt, the maim, and the blind— cases often incurable even by the most advanced surgery. But now that there is a British Medical Officer in charge, we have noticed a considerable increase in the number of patients and the population are rapidly ridding themselves of their distrust of something which they get for nothing. It is intended shortly to erect a bed, and the Medical Officer has promised that, as soon as this has been fitted up, he will make provision for surgical cases. None have as yet been attempted. The Hit Civil Post Office was opened in November 1918, and is apparently very much appreciated by all in the town. We have secured the services of an ex-Turkish telegraphist and it should not be difficult, later, to add a telegraph office. The financial basis of the Baladiyah is fairly sound. The balance in hand at the end of November last was Rs. 4,636/-, but the monthly income is still slightly below the expenditure. This will be placed upon a sounder footing as soon as it is found possible to introduce new taxes. The Rais al Baladiyah and the Qadhi have throughout given every satisfaction, especially the former, who has done all in his power to assist in the administration. 6. Shabanahs. —There is difficulty in Hit district in recruiting the Shabanah force from the proper quarter. Since it is not possible to recruit from the families of Shaikhs as in most districts, the majority of the Shabanahs are Hitawis and townsmen. This plan, however, has not been found to be particularly bad. There are a few ex-Turkish gendarmes amongst the force who give colour to the military spirit and appearance of the corps. The strength at first sanctioned was : In September it was found necessary to establish a post at Anqal Hawa for blockade purposes. A fort was constructed and sanction obtained for an additional 10 horse and 5 foot to man it. The force was nearly useless without rifles, but these were eventually supplied by the military authorities. 1 Discipline on the whole has been good, though cases of bribery have been brought to light on a few occasions. Generally speaking, attempts at drill have not been welcomed; there appears to be a constant fear that the force is to be made a military one, in spite of repeated assurances that this is not what is desired. The Shabanahs were not fully equipped with rifles and uniforms until November, when summer clothing was issued. It would appear advisable to provide them with something warmer than khaki drill during the winter months. Attempts have been made to train the mounted Shabanahs in the proper care of their horses, but little can be done in this direction until arrangements are made for the supply of some sort of veterinary chest. Sores and wounds are continually appearing and, for want of stores, they have to be left to heal as best they can. Mounted Shabanahs are difficult to recruit in this area and the utmost economy in horseflesh should be practised. owing to the suspicion with which the compilation is viewed.

Miscellaneous : (a) Law and Order. — This has been fairly good in the district during our occupation. Two Arabs were hanged on the Hit—Kubaisah road in July 1918 for the murder of two sepoys of the 97th Infantry, and it is considered that this produced a good effect on the local population. One of the most serious robberies reported was a case in which Rs. 2,615 and £T.12 were taken. This occurred in July also. The inhabitants of the district, being for the most part peaceful townsmen or cultivators, are content to remain unaffected by tribal jealousy and quarrels, provided they are allowed to pursue their several occupations unhindered. (b) Resources and Industries .—Hit is said to owe its origin to its lime and bitumen kilns just outside, which are said to have been worked for several thousand years. Since our occupation, large quantities both of lime and bitumen have been exported for the use of the Military; but, though it was necessary to concentrate chiefly on their requirements, it seemed advisable to encourage private enterprise as far as possible. A product of the lime is the “ jus,” which is used extensively as cement. But it has the disadvantage of not being impervious to water. It is very cheap, costing even now, during the war, only Rs. 20/- a ton, but it could never be exported for use in a wet climate. Several salt pans lie just outside the town. These have hitherto been managed by the local produce officer, but now that this Department is no longer represented in Hit, the advisability of the Political Department taking them over is being considered. It is questionable, however, whether this course is to be recommended, since bv far the largest issues have been made to the Military, and but little revenue would come in from this source. Naphtha springs are said to exist to the north of Hit on the left bank. Pottery is made on a fairly large scale, the chief demand being for the small earthenware jars which, attached to the na urs, raise the water from the river. Hit has a considerable export trade in the vessels in which Arab women through out the country carry water from riverside to house. They are made from plaited palm fronds and are finally given a waterproof covering of bitumen. Dibs, or date treacle, is made on a small scale. Weaving is a minor industry. Four or five years ago there was quite an important shipbuilding industry, bitumen beino- used to render the craft waterproof. Large building yards were situated on the southern outskirts of the'town, but the war has hampered the trade and only a small number of cc asbiyahs,” u shahturs,” and qufahs ^ are built at the present time. Every encouragement is being given to the expansion of what will no doubt be, in time, one of the leading industries of ‘Iraq. , r/ Wood is exceedingly scarce, such supplies as there are coming from Dair al Zor, 250 miles upstream. 9 Conclusion. —The war has played havoc with this district as with every other ’ and it cannot fail to leave its mark, which will be apparent for many generations to come. But, even now, -trade, industries, and agriculture are showing signs of a revival. It is, therefore, confidently to be expected that the Hit district will become an important trade centre, for it has possibilities above those of the average district in ‘Iraq in this respect. G.S.S.

Basrah Municipal Area .—Lying within the Sanjaq limits is the Basrah Municipal Area, which extends from the Sarraji creek on the south to the Euphrates on the north; on the right bank, the desert being the western boundary, while on the left bank it comprises the Tanumah Military Area, which is bounded on the east by the desert, on the west by the Shatt, and on the north and south by lines drawn at right angles from the mouth of the Chabasi creek and from a point opposite Sarraji creek respectively. Zubair Tribes .—Description of political and tribal affairs in this district must keep Zubair very much in a separate compartment, and I quote below in extenso that portion of the report of the Assistant Political Officer which falls within the scope of this chapter: “ (a) Dhafir.— The Dhafir tribes occupy the northern area of the district. They were, in the beginning of this year, at Shaqrah, Dafinah, and Jahb Sadun. Durmg the hot weather most of the tribes lived near the river off Safar m Nasariyah Division, the remainder were at Jalib Sa dun and Haisamah. They have now all moved out to Shaqrah again. _ i ^i • + “The Shaikh, Humud Suwait, is wily and elusive and nothing great can be expected ot him. He is weak in character and easily cowed to submission. He has been pinned down to providing his share of men for Shabanah work on the B N Railway line, but he did not take to it with good grace and the men are poor in quahty. Humud was brought to make peace with the A.] man on their arrival in this area, and later with the Shammar when they flocked m from the Tawal. He kept his pact with the ‘Ajman, but allowed, and I believe encouraged his men to annoy the Shammar in every possible way. This tribe is not as in come as its neighbours the Shammar ^ ‘Ajman and its ^ nearly as independent in character. Many of them come to Zubair foi coolie “ (b) Shammar.— The Shammar tribes, under our control during cold weather, occupy he d't called the Tawal, which includes Bir Umm Rahumah and Bir UnsTb and in the summer months were , near the river between Luqait and Rumailah. They went to Chabdah at the end of summer a„ d have now moved out to Ichlawi. The tribes are very scattered, the reason being that their paramount Chief, Ibn Rashid, remained in the pay of the enemy and was away fighting his battles.238 “ His tribes in and around Hail and in the Tawal, being without a leader and short of provisions, went where they could best provide for themselves. About 3,000 tents joined the late Shaikh, Sa‘ud al Salih, a number joined the Dhafir, and some went north to the ‘Anizah. They have given no trouble beyond raiding, which is common to all, and it was alleged by the Dhafir that they had tampered with the railway line and telegraph poles. It is strongly suspected that the Dhafir Shabanah were the offenders and that it was done in order to implicate the Shammar tribes then living in that area. The late Shaikh, Sa‘ud al Salih Subhan, was murdered at Ichlawi in November by a sub-shaikh of his tribe, who claimed that SaTid was responsible for the death of his brother. “ Sa‘ud was well liked by most of the tribes for his personal qualities as a desert fighter and strategist, but had not sufficient prestige as a shaikh, and the general opinion among them was that they were as good as he in that respect. Sa‘ud was unstable in character and reckless in speech. He aimed at becoming the recognised chief of all Shammar and to that end did his best lately to work in with us. He was the best informed man on desert affairs in the whole district, and his friendship was of great value in a political sense. No one has yet been nominated in his place. “ Shaikh Dhari ibn Tawalah of Aslam, Shammar, keeps entirely aloof from other Shammar tribes; but most of his followers have been scattered during the whole time he has been in this area, some were at Hafar and others in Sa‘ud’s camp, whilst his camp at Safwan Wells was filled with elements from the ‘Anizah and ‘Ajman. He had only about 50 tents of his own people with him there. He has now moved to Shaqaq, a place about 30 miles south-west of Jabal Sanam. Dhari is a man of very pleasing exterior and frank open manner, giving one the impression that he is sincere. His conduct during the last year has shown him to be the reverse. He has been convicted of procuring food for the enemy, disregard of orders given to him by the Political Officers who had charge of his affairs, and obtaining Rs. 6,000/- in subsidies from one officer which he had already received in advance from another. He is low and cunning in his dealings and has very little intelligence. He hated and feared the late Sa‘ud al Salih, and is utterly despised by Ibn Rashid. His subsidy was reduced this year from Rs. 3,000/- to Rs. 1,000/-. ( c ) Ajman. The Ajman tribe under Shaikh Dhaidan ibn Hithlain came into this area in May, having been ordered here from Kuwait. They settled at Chubaibdah and Rafadhiyah and gave no trouble. They moved out to the desert when the rains came and are now about midway between Jabal Sanam and Hafar, to the north of the Batin. They number about 600 tents and are rich in camels. Their camels are the best to be found in Arabia, and about 1,000 were purchased from them for the Government during ]\Iay and June. The ‘Ajman are very small in stature, but strong and wiry. I hey are reputed to be good fighters and extremely rapacious, and are feared and respected by most other tribes. Their women enjoy more personal liberty and have more influence in affairs than those of most other tribes. They often take part in the fighting, and it is common to see them carry arms when coming in here with their caravans. Their Shaikh, Dahidan, is a typical Ajman, short and thickset, with strong features and sinister look. He is very independent in character, speaks his mind and loses no time in coming to the point. He would be very useful on our side if there were fighting with Bedouins to be done, provided always his heart were in it. His hold over his tribe is rather loose, but that is due to their unruly nature. His cousin, Sultan Hithlain, is a dwarf, but gives the impression of being very hardy. Shaikh Khumais ibn Munaikhir is the head of the Safran sub-tribe of ‘Ajman, consisting of about 200 tents. They are a separate tribe and Dhaidan has no control over them, but the whole live together amicably* Khumais is a battered old warrior of about 50, lame through wounds and limps badly. He is said to be the best fighting leader m the whole desert. He is strong and independent in character, and, like Dhaidan, does not waste time m words. He also would be useful on our side. “(d) About 200 tents of Dahamshah, ‘Anizah, have been in this area since May They have lived the whole time on the river near Rumailah and have given no trouble They have now moved out to Ichlawi with the Shammar. They were suspected of being here only in order to obtain food and were simply 1S ’ ^ here J or f: kn ? wn about them. Their Shaikh, Sa‘ad ibn Mijlad, was sent for from time to time in order to keep us in touch with them. Heis a young man of about 30, of medium height and build, and looks strong and capable. He says that he has completely broken relations with his tribe and wishes to remain in this area. There is, to my knowledge, no present objection. “ Inter-tribal Raiding.—'YYiis pastime has been indulged in as usual throughout the summer, and, with the exception of one unfortunate raid by combined ‘Ajman and Shammar on a trader’s caravan going from Kuwait to ‘Anizah, and some annoyance given to Zubair traders on the caravan roads leading from Kuwait and Nasiriyah by Mutair parties raiding in this district, it has been confined to old standing feuds, irrespective of whether the tribes were friendly to us or not. “ Shammar and “A]man joined hands against the Mutair, Subai 4 and Bani Hajr of Najd. Some Shammar raided the Rawalah and ‘Anizah in the west and north. The Dhafir, with the Sudaid and Toman of Shammar, who were living with them, devoted most of their attention to the ‘Anizah, but were also kept busy by the Najd tribes, who were here in great force during July and August. From all accounts the honours appeared to be even. Our tribes have in any case not complained of their luck. The Beduin call this sport their trade and resent interference in it. Attempts were made this year to suppress it, but with little success. When threatened with loss of subsidies and food, the shaikhs promised to cease altogether if the order was imposed on all concerned. The shaikhs are inot in a position to stop it completely, but if the practice were discountenanced and examples made of the culprits in some cases, it would gradually die out. Another method of putting an end to it would be to prohibit the sale and importation of arms and ammunition to Iraq. The Beduin have not more than an average of 20 rounds per rifle, and when this is expended their raids will revolve themselves into robbery with no fatal results. They might then be more easily made amenable to useful occupations, such as policing and trade. Zubair Town : (a) The Shaikh. —Shaikh Ibrahim ‘Abdullah is intelligent and experienced in desert politics. He is tactful and winning in his manner towards Europeans. He is not so towards his own people, and he is often arrogant and overbearing in his dealings with them. He exercises the power vested in him to the fullest extent, and he is feared in consequence, but has no influence with his people beyond that. His aim is to keep the town and its inhabitants in its present unde veloped state, and he has hitherto resisted all encroachments of modern progress. He is an extremist in his religious views. He always takes care to veil his opinions when in opposition to our policy, and I have had no difficulty in keeping on good terms with him. (b) Population. —The inhabitants are chiefly descendants of the group of emigrants that came here from Najd about 250 years ago, and others that followed in their train. Thev are of the Sunni sect, but not Wahhabi. “ There are no' Europeans. Jews and Christians have been consistently dis couraged from settling here. The people are intelligent above the average and some of them have ideals worthy of note. Their want of enterprise, which is evident everywhere, would appear to be due to lack of encouragement. The population is not at present known, but is estimated to be about 8 to 10,000. “ The old town is purely Arab in its construction and much of it is crumbling into decay. A considerable addition was made to it during the 30 years preceding the war, and this part, with its wide and well-aligned streets and large roomy houses, is a credit to the administrators of that time. The old wall, which originally surrounded the town, marks distinctly the division between the two periods. “ (c) Trade. All the trade of the town is done in the market, which is composed of the usual small shops with an open front, cramped into a few narrow closed-in lanes. Rice, dates, &amp;c., required for the desert are in stores bordering on open spaces suitable for loading caravans. “ (d) Industry. There are no productive industries in the town, and it owes its existence to being the distributing centre for trade between the western desert and Basrah. Beduin bring in their animals, wools, skins, &amp;c., for sale, and take their requirements, which are chiefly rice, dates, barley, coffee, and cloth. I here are no evidences of wealth, nor of extreme poverty. The proportion of rich people in the town is small. Street begging is unknown. There are few coffee-shops, and no places of amusement. “ (e) Water Supply. Water is scarce in Zubair. The sole source of supply is Dirhamiyeh Wells. This is a natural basin an acre in extent situated 2 miles240 South of Zubair. The rainfall for miles around flows almost naturally into it and forms a lake. The Jabal Sanam Railway now passes near the wells and has interrupted the flow, with the result that the water has made a new channel for itself and is lost. The lake usually runs dry in March, and then the wells are opened. “ About 100 shallow wells exist, which are worked about 20 at a time. A well is closed wheij the water becomes brackish and another opened. As the whole of Zubair inhabitants draw their water from it, the place is thoroughly drained towards the end of the summer, and at times there has been a considerable amount of sickness due to this fact. Lack of water is, in fact, one of the chief drawbacks to living in Zubair, and a movement is on foot to obtain water direct from the river by pipes. The matter has been discussed with some prominent members of the town, and the cost of the installation would be partly covered by voluntary contributions. It is considered that the town would willingly provide the whole sum. I am of opinion that, if this were done and road communications improved, Zubair would become the favoured residential quarter of Basrah.” Conclusion of Zubair Report. —I have little to add to the Assistant Political Officer’s report. He himself has done good work among the tribes, and I look to him to gradually instil in the mind of Shaikh Ibrahim the idea that his best interests in the future lie in recognition of his nearness to modern progress as it will be exempli fied in Basrah, and to the ordering of his conduct of affairs in harmony with the desert on one side and urban stable civilisation on the other. The continuance of Government in the settled portions of ‘Iraq will spread its sure, if slow, influence on the Beduin mind, paving the way, perhaps, for that greater Arab State which is one of the dreams of the scheme of the political heaven. Basrah Sanjaq Society. —The Basrah Sanjaq comprises a portion of the marshes formed by the Euphrates in the effort to carve for itself a southern channel for its junction with the Shatt-al-‘Arab. The marsh Arabs of this area are nomads who make a livelihood as fishermen and in the rearing of cattle for dairy produce. They carry on their occupations peaceably and have given no trouble. For the other part, the Sanjaq is a settled district, the land along both banks of the river under rich date plantation owned by landlords, chiefly Arabs, but comprising also some Jews and Christians. These landlords are men of gentility and pride, occupying a position of influence and status reminiscent of that of the feudal landlords in English history, their fallaheen subject to their will, but showing now a spirit of some independence born in their work in Army Labour Corps at the base. They are men of little education, but, if ignorant under modern standards, a tolerant and fair-minded class on the whole. Their sons will, under a sound system of education, form a. society of Arab squires and business men which will be a factor of great importance in the political development of this country. This class is instinct with many of the feelings which are productive of the best English types, and, led with right understanding, it will form with men of English race a fit comrade in the march of progress and good government in Iraq. The landlord class has naturally suffered much in the impressment of labour and of river craft in the service of the Army, and the rough methods of military exigency have brought coldness of heart in many men, formerly the friends and admirers of the British. They have, however, shown themselves reasonable and in the officers of the Civil Administration they have evidence of a character of official treatment and race relationship which goes to soften the bluntness of an arnry’s ways. This coldness of heart will pass away; but it points strongly to the need of careful selection of British officers for service in this administration. To the best type of English gentlemen, strong, manly, just, and considerate, the better class will respond in the same measure as he detests and fears some of the lesser virtues of the “ British other rank ” and often of the officer of our army of to-day. Hostility between Shi‘ah and Sunni. —The cultivators of the Sanjaq are for the most part Shi ah, as are the majority of the people of the town. The most influential of the landlords are Sunni, the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who owns much property in this district, a notable exception. He exercises great authority over many of the Muhaisin tribe who live in the Sanjaq and acknowledge the Shaikh as their overlord. In the town of Basrah also the leaders of Arab society are Sunni, though the Shi ah Ulama occupy a position of prominence. The feeling between the two sects is very strong and it will be an achievement for an impartial rule to weld them together m affairs temporal for the common good of the whole.Jews and Christians. In the town of Basrah the Jews are in strong force with a total number of 6,499 (census 1918). Christians number 2,240. While the Moham medans of this district are, as a body, somewhat apathetic and lethargic in their outlook on life and in need of stimulus, the Jews and Christians are alert. The Mohammedans must not only be set on the new track of progress, but exhorted and encouraged to move along it; while it will be sufficient for the Jew and Christian that the tract be laid, they will be on it before it is ready. So it is we have an urgent demand on the part of the non-Moslems for British rule and an acquiescence in the idea of the necessity of it on the part of the Moslems, with a wistful eye on the red tarbush which the Osmanli made the young Arab wear. But the Mohamme dan will advance, and he has not the vulgarity which the Jew has in his haste and which excites Mohammedan contempt. But let us hope that the culture of ‘Iraq will be common to its people, identical not in expression but in its essence. 2. Revenue : Land Revenue. —The Zubair district brings in no revenue to Government, the Shaikh having the benefit of local taxation. In the Basrah Sanjaq date plantations provide all but a small part of the land revenue of the Sanjaq, and revenue on such lands is collected according to the Turkish assessment. This assessment is based on an old survey made some 40 years ago, and represents the cash equivalent of the State’s demand as it then was. In the period during which this assessment has been in force the value of dates has increased, it is computed, by 500 to 600 per cent, or more. Estates have also grown in extent, while in a few cases they have deteriorated. So it comes about that the Revenue demand is far short of what it should be on the recognised basis of assessment, while in exceptional cases the demand may be much greater than the whole produce is worth. This matter was dealt with in last year’s report, but it has not been possible to carry out a fresh survey and assessment. The year opened with arrears to the extent of Rs. 43,478. Of this sum, Rs. 39,493 have been collected. The total demand for the current year is Rs. 7,67,824, less remission to the Shaikhs of Muhammarah and Kuwait on their properties in this district to the extent of Rs. 1,04,658 for services rendered to Government. Collection has been much delayed owing to the lateness of the date season, but is now proceeding rapidly. Remissions have again been made in cases of damage caused by military occupation. Tapu. —The tapu office was formerly part of that of the Political Officer. It was transferred in 1916 to the control of the Revenue Officer and has recently returned to its old home as part of the Divisional Administration. Statistics for the year 1917 and 1918 are given below and show marked increase in work during the management of Captain Brown, whose personal inspections throughout the district have been the subject of popular and favourable comment. The strong advance in acquisition of landed and house property by Jews and Christians is a noticeable feature and one in keeping with the political situation, these two classes being prepared to take advantage of the liberty found and expected to continue. 1917. 1918.

A survey must be undertaken as soon as possible. The law is difficult to ascertain, but the position in this respect will improve:— “ There are certain matters which ought to receive attention at a very early date if the work of land registration is ever to be satisfactory. “ (A) The fundamental defect in the Tapu system is the lack of a survey. Before the British occupation no survey operations were undertaken even in individual transactions. Now an unconnected plan accompanies every Kashi report. But even that plan is, to my mind, of little permanent value. It is impossible to identify with accuracy the position and boundaries of any holding. Though a tapu sanad is supposed to be final proof of title, title to a piece of land which cannot be accurately localised is far from complete. The Turkish law provided for a survey, but it has never been undertaken. “(B) It has been frequently pointed out that the tapu registers are registers of title to the neglect of actual possession. One important case has come to my notice where a sanad was granted for part of a holding that had long been registered. The new sanad was issued in Turkish times following on a Shar‘ah decree and a decision of the Majlis Idarah, but the old sanad was never cancelled or amended. “(C) In the absence of a survey too much depends on the Ilm wa Khabr of the Mukhtar. Even when a kashf takes place the kashf clerk or officer has to depend on the Mukhtar for very important information regarding the extent and boundaries of the land in question. If a Mukhtar is corrupt, and the Turks had no very high opinion of a Mukhtar’s honesty, his opportunity is almost unlimited. (D) The method of sale of mortgaged lands by brokers is undoubtedly unsatisfactory. Whether any better method can be introduced I am not prepared to say; but prices are certainly low and dalals are not angels. (E) No one at any rate in Basrah—appears to know what is the actual tapu law. I have recently received from Baghdad a translation of a number of new laws which are absolutely unknown to local tapu officials and the general public in Basrah. Noi do I myself know whether these new Turkish laws are to be followed or not. ( I) The question of wafq arises out of this question of the tapu law. A law of 1329 actually states that wafq may be sold or mortgaged. That law strikes at the very loot of waqf. Is it to be introduced among so religiously conservative a people as the Shi ahs of ‘Iraq ? ” &amp; J Waqf. The religious endowments of the Sunni sect are under the control of t le Assistant Political Officer, Basrah Sanjaq, management being in the hands of Khan Sahib Muzaffar Shah, who has, to assist him on matters of principle, a com mittee ot two imams and a Sunni lawyer. (a) Turkish Corruption.-The Turkish Administration of waqf was notoriously inefficient and many properties were encroached upon and many completely mis- appropnated. Bribery was rampant and full revenue was never collected. A good example of former practice is to be found in a lease of house property in ‘Ashar which was given m the early days of our own administration to a local Mohammedan o some m iience for an annual rent of Rs. 17,000/-. The lease will expire on 31st March, and we then expect to obtain, by leasing each house separately, an annualrent of about a lakh, of rupees. The lessee is now making a profit of a sum represented by the difference between these two figures. (b) Effort 8 towards Efficiency. —Khan Sahib Muzaffar Shah has worked hard in the discovery and correct assessment of rent of house property in Basrah, ably assisted by Sulaiman Faizi, the third member of the Arab Committee. Their labours have been regarded with alarm by those, great and small, who have enriched them selves by illegal means on wafq property, but the people generally have watched their work with strong approval. To instance the advance in efficiency in this department I quote the estimated income for the current financial year as Rs. 2,75,886/-, an increase of Rs. 1,18,351/— on that of the previous year. The credit for this great improvement is due chiefly to the Khan Sahib. (c) Property. —TheAuqaf of this Division comprise some 300 shops and houses, 749 date gardens, and 234 plots of ‘arasah land. The want of a survey and the consequent laxness of description of property in Turkish registers conspired with the corrupt spirit of the former Administration in the prevention of the too rapid growth of religious endowments; and the Assistant Political Officer notes, in his report, on the danger to the State of the excessive growth of such endowments likely to ensue from the combination of the continuance of the pious sentiment which is responsible for them and of an honest Government. (d) Expenditure. —Expenditure in administration, in the upkeep of mosque establishments, maintenance of property, &amp;c., will fall within Rs. 60,000/- for the current financial year. When the restrictions imposed by the Military occupation have been removed, much renovation and repair of house property and improvement in garden lands will be necessary. There is, further, great demand for the con struction in Basrah of a mosque of more pretension than any that now exists, a work which will call for funds greater than we have at our disposal. The good administration of auqaf in Basrah will bring in a greatly enhanced and growing revenue during the next decade, and it is to be hoped that there will be no demand for the complete management of affairs by Mohammedans without the supervision of a British official. Popular sentiment does now T call for direct management by an Arab under British control, and I hope that some person suitable for the post will soon be discovered. Sanniyah. —The Sanniyah Department was, for a time, under the Revenue Board, but was placed again under the Assistant Political Officer on the 1st of April 1918. Origin of Sanniyah. —The Dairah Sanniyah originally controlled estates that were the private property of the Sultan of Turkey. When the young Turks rebelled and established the parliamentary system in Turkey, the Sultan’s estates w r ere confiscated and made the property of the Government. The revenues derived therefrom are said to have been appropriated by the Union and Progress Party at that time in power. All Government buildings, such as barracks and store houses, were then entered upon the Sanniyah registers. In order to increase their party funds all ‘Amiriyah lands that were cultivated solely in winter rain crops, were also entered on these registers. These ‘Amiriyah lands do not properly belong to Sanniyah and should revert to the former status under the control of the Land Revenue Department. They are cultivated by any who choose to take them up and pay revenue at a tenth of the produce. Property.—A.t present Sanniyah property consists of :—(1) a certain number of buildings such as the ‘Ashar Barracks, the Indian base depot or ex-Turkish naval base headquarters, the sto're houses and ex-Turkish Military bakeries near the Customs House, ‘Ashar, &amp;e.; (2) certain date gardens near ‘Ashar and Manawi; (3) large agricultural estates in the district, viz. :— Dawasir - Aradhah - - - - - Du‘aiji - - - - ■ ‘Amiyah - Qaus - Harthah - (4) the ‘Amiriyah lands in Harthah and those behind the palm belt in the Shatt- al-‘Arab Nahiyah such as Daimat Ghadhban and Bab Zaid. Over 3,000 jaribs. „ U200 „ „ 2,300 „ „ 800 „ • „ 100 „ 200 „ .. S 2244 Buildings .—The Sanniyah buildings have all been occupied by the Military authorities. Gardens .—The few date gardens near ‘Ashar have all been occupied by the Military authorities and have been rendered useless for agricultural purposes. They are occupied for the most part by the I.W.T. dockyard and camps, and have become very valuable owing to the development of the areas in which they are situated. Harthah Estates .—The most important part of Sanniyah property consists of the large estates in the district. In Harthah the Sanniyah gardens are small and scattered all over the Nahiyah. As all other date gardens in Harthah, they are in poor condition, having suffered badly from the floods in 1915 and 1916. As a rule ta‘abs here are wealthy men, who live in Basrah and have a fallah looking after the land. This is a bad system, and efforts are being made to secure resident ta‘abs. Dawasir Estate .—Dawasir is a large estate, fairly well planted. There is, however, much to be done by way of improvement. ‘Aradhah Estate .—The ‘ Aradhah Estate was put under cultivation some 15 years ago. It is well planted, but there is still much land vacant and awaiting tenants. Du'aiji Estate. —Du‘aijiis in somewhat poor condition. In this estate Sanniyah as landlord is responsible for the clearing of the main creeks, which have been rapidly silting up and preventing the free action of tidal irrigation to the detriment of the gardens. It is hoped that a small dredger will shortly be obtained from the I.W.T. for this service. ‘Amiyah Estate .—‘Amiyah is a very poor estate, and much work remains to be done on it. Qaus Estate .—Qaus is a small but very flourishing estate and forms a very pleasant contrast with ‘Amiyah. Effect of War. —Sanniyah, like all other landlords, has suffered badly from the effect of the present war. In the earlier stages the estates were, more or less, left to look after themselves, no personnel being available for supervision. Then, as on the land were sent to the Labour Corps, being relieved at regular intervals. The cleaning of creeks and digging up and manuring of the soil were largely suspended, and, as work on the land decreased, the date crops decreased. We have now to make up much leeway. We are starting by having the main Du‘aiji creek dredged and the main creek at Dawasir cleaned by hand, while every effort is being made to encourage cultivation and to secure release of labour from Army work as early as possible. Revenues .—The revenue derived from Sanniyah from the time of the British occupation to the present day is as follows :— The gradual increase in revenue is due to the fact that the officers in charge have been able to gain more knowledge as to prices of dates, auctions, and local business transactions generally. This year dates sold for a high price, and, though considerably higher prices would have been obtained by Sanniyah had I felt justified in taking the risk of holding up produce a little longer, the result was very satisfactory^. The success obtained is due in part to greater efficiency and honesty in the work of crop estimation. Crop Estimation. In this respect an important innovation was made this year. Previously the crop on any one Sanniyah estate was estimated as a whole, and the landlord’s share was fixed at the usual rate of 60 per cent. The responsibility of apportioning his spare to each tenent was left to the Sarkals. These men thereby gained extraoi dinary power and had full opportunity for its improper exercise. The first thing they are reported to have done was to increase the shares due by the ta abs to the landlord and to decrease their own to zero, their favourites by the the Army’s demands for labour increased, a large proportion of the natives working 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 Rs. 130,482 126,984 176,015 227,629 291,907estimated separately and the tenant received in writing from the officer present the account of dates due from him to Sanniyah. This caused great satisfaction among the ta abs and no little chagrin to the sarkals, who had sought to cloak their eyac ions by excessive declaration before the Political Officers of their fealty amd devotion to good works. The individual estimation was carried out by Khan bahib Muzzaffar Shah with his customary zeal and efficiency. Amb Manager—It is now proposed to appoint an Arab landowner of high position and integrity as manager of the Sanniyah Estates, as direct management by officials more or less tied down to headquarters (however capable thev be) cannot be so effective as supervision by one man with minute local knowledge and experience. Under British supervision such a manager will make of Sanniyah model estates. J _ Miscellaneous and Special J?eve^e.—Miscellaneous and special revenue will bring m about Rs. 5,00,000/-. Detail is shown in Appendix A., from which it will be seen there is an advance of Rs. 1,20,000/- over last year. I quote below the Assistant Political Officer s report on the items Araq, tobacco, and opium. ( a ) Araq. The ‘araq monopoly for the current financial year has been auctioned and taken up by a Jew for Rs. 20,000 a month—a figure which must leave him only a small margin of profit in view of the high price of dates. The distillery was burnt down at the beginning of September for the second time within 12 months, and as materials for reconstruction could not at once be obtained it was necessary to remit the distiller’s fee wffiolly for September and in part for October and November. During these three months his output was very low, and retail sellers were permitted to bring supplies from Nasiriyah and Muhammarah. This unfortunate accident has robbed Government of the expected increment over last year in the price received for the monopoly ; but the distiller is building now according to expert specification, so that there should be no reoccurrence of these fires. The number of retail shops remains the same, and, except during the period of scarcity, there has been no rise in the retail price of araq. (b) Tobacco. —There are now 108 wholesale and 511 retail tobacco merchants, also 123 hawkers. Decrease in number is due to the high price of tobacco and the enhancement of licence fees. The tax paid by hawkers has recently been raised from Rs. 20/- to Rs. 30/-, and the cost of a wholesale licence from’ Rs. 100/- to Rs. 150/-. A number of tobacco licencees are Indians, who own coffee-shops and cater for the troops. The retail rate is assessed at a round figure of Rs. 10/- per annum for shops in the Sanjaq; but in the municipal area the old Turkish rule by which 30/- per cent, of the rental of the shop is charged, is still followed. The tobacco revenue last year was Rs. 34,126/-, and for the eight months now^ ended receipts amount to Rs. 33,793. (c) Opium. —The Mudir of tobacco has also charge of opium licensing. A licencee has now been found for Basrah City, and the ‘ashar licence holders have been permitted to appoint three sub-agents for the sale of opium to Persian Labour Corps in Nahr ‘Umar, Ma‘qil and Khorah. The excise revenue this year should be nearly thrice what it was in 1917. The hashish licencees in ‘Ashar were imprisoned for smuggling by the Port Officer, Tanumah, in October and the licencees are at present in abeyance. There is no doubt a good deal of smuggling which is undetected in spite of police vigilance, the middle men being persons employed on hospital ships and other vessels coming from India. Customs .—Customs will be dealt with separately by the Chief Collector of Customs. Compensation .—The Assistant Political Officer has carried out the duties of Compensation Officer throughout the year; it is important work, which requires considerable time and care if it is to be properly done. General Routine Order, No. 1307 of 20th November has now abolished the cumbersome procedure of refer ence first to Area Commandants and then to a committee at base headquarters, and the Assistant Political Officer is disposing of claims himself in direct commu nication with the Military Departments concerned. During the year 458 claims have been examined and settled, and a sum of Rs. 416,363/- has been paid in com pensation. The large increase is due to the systematic disposal of claims by procedure winch had not been introduced in 1917. In the Ma‘qil area compensation has not been paid since August in view of land acquisition proposals.246 rs 3. Irrigation. —There is nothing to report under this head. There are no schemes of note under immediate consideration in this district and our only special activity in irrigation is in the improvement of the main canals which silt up and for which I am arranging to procure, on loan, a small dredger. 4. Agriculture. —Under this head I quote from the reports of the Assistant Political Officers as follows :— “ ( a ) Basrah Sanjaq.—One cannot point to much improvement in agricultural conditions in the Sanjaq during the year. The Military demands on nati\e labour continued to dominate the situation, and the supply available for landowners has been further reduced bv the devastating effects of broncho-pneumonia which swept the Sanjaq in the last quarter of the year. Little has, therefore, been done in the way of canal clearance or extension of the cultivated area. At the beginning of the year it was anticipated that all, or nearly all, Arab labour would be released in time for the winter sowing, and in this hope the Agricultural Department was asked to make provision for advances to cultivators of wheat seed from the Ivarun. Expectation has not, however, been fulfilled in this respect, and we have been unable to induce anyone to take advantage of the facilities offered. A large supply of agricultural irrigation pumps was expected from India; but the few that have arrived prove too large and too expensive to be suitable for Sanjaq landlords. The date crop was good in quality, but in quantity about 30 per cent, less than normal, owing to low water and the attacks of the hamirah insect. A good deal of damage was done by the early rain in November to dates awaiting packing in the chardaghs. “ Zubair .—^Agriculture in Zubair is undeveloped. The system is to sink a series of wells and work them alternately. This is necessary because the water, which is brackish at all times, becomes extremely so after a well has been worked a year, and if continued into the second year wall kill the crops. A w r ell is, therefore, filled in on the water becoming bad and another is worked. The first one is again purified by being partly filled in and left idle. There are about 95 such wells with gardens near Zubair, at 20 of which bersim is growm and the crops continue throughout the year. The value of this crop is about Rs. 1,17,000 yearly. “ The remaining 75 gardens grow melons, pumpkins, tomatoes, brinjals, and onions during the season. The total value of the crop is about Rs. 2,00,000 yearly. “ Wheat is sown as soon as the first rain falls, both in these gardens and in patches where water collects. The soil is productive provided there is a sufficient rainfall, but the crops are often lost through drought. This year is considered good, the rains having come early. About 45 tons of seed have been used. This is estimated to produce from 300 to 500 tons, according to the weather. The cost of labour is now high, and agriculture is not considered here to be very lucrative.” 5. Basrah Municipality. —The Basrah municipal area extends over a district some 18 square miles in extent and comprises the towns of Basrah and ‘Ashar and 23 villages. These villages are subject to no taxation except a levy for sanitary services. It will be convenient to touch on a few salient features and then embody in my report extracts from that of the Municipal Commissioner and of the Assistant Military Governor. Municipal Control .—The continuation of Basrah city and ‘Ashar as separate municipalities within a greater wTiole is unprofitable. We require now a single municipal fund in place of the two which exist and steps will be taken to this end. The separate Advisory Councils have already been abolished and a single council constituted under the presidency of the Municipal Commissioner. The members of this Council are nominated, as were those of its predecessors. Its proceedings are made public in the press and its w-ork has served well to lead us up to fuller corporate control at the hands of a more formally constituted council wTiich we hope to create early in the new year. Financial .—The estimated revenue collection for the current year is Rs. 3,64,000 in Basrah city and Rs. 3,18,000 in ‘Ashar, a total of Rs. 6,82,000/-, as against last year’s figures of Rs. 3,01,000/- in Basrah and Rs. 2,85,000/-in ‘Ashar. a total of Rs. 5,86,000/-. The surplus receipts over expenditure will be roughly Rs. 93,000/-. Add to this Rs. 3,14,000/-, the previous balance in hand, and we shall have to our credit at the end of the financial year four lakhs of rupees. The position is therefore satisfactory. We are about to embark on a constructive policy, however, and stand in need of liberal funds. Water supply, now a special dole at the hands of Military services, will, I hope, be speedily taken up by a private company soas to mee u y the needs of the people. This will throw no charge on municipal funds. Am emcient scheme of sanitation, with the erection of destructors and provision of carriage, will be a costly matter, involving increase of taxation. The provision and maintenance of metalled roads is an equally urgent matter with similar financial results. The improvement of the town generally, the broadening of streets, demolition of dangerous houses, clearance of unsanitary areas, erection of municipal markets, improvement and extension of waterways and bridges and many other projects of pressing need will likewise make heavy demand on the civil purse. Taxation is, however, not now heavy. The house tax of 10 per cent, of the assessed rent is lenient in that, in our wish to prevent rack-renting, we have assessed our figures on a scale far below the actual rates obtaining, thus designedly sacrificing a very considerable increment to revenue. The conditions which made this action advisable, and which led to the introduction of the Restriction of Rent Regulation (which prevents a suit for rent in excess of assessed rent) are now tending to disappear with the repatriation of the refugees to Baghdad, and the municipality will be in a position at the beginning of the new financial year to levy its house tax on the market rent value. What increase on the percentage levied and what other modifications in the existing scheme of taxation should be provided for are matters for future decision. Heads of income are shown in Appendices A. and B. in the Municipal Commissioner’s report attached. Works. —The Deputy Assistant Director of Works (Civil) carried out 26 major works, i. e., works of Rs. 5,000/— and over, at a cost of Rs. 6,50,000/— during the year, and over 400 minor works at a cost of Rs. 1,60,000/-. He worked against great difficulty, army demand on labour and materials causing the starvation of the Civil Works Department in these respects. It has been impossible to proceed with the many urgent schemes of improvement which are continually put forward, and municipal work has been a long series of disappointments to those who have had the welfare of the town at heart. And, further, it has been impossible to demonstrate to the people of Basrah the anxiety and ability of its British guardians to administer their affairs in the terms of their profession, thus losing much in political influence. Nevertheless much has been accomplished in petty works in the face of what often seemed insurmountable obstacles. Extracts from Report by the. Municipal Commissioner :— Municipal Improvements. —Several schemes for the improvement of the towns of ‘Aahar and Basrah have been worked out and are now ready for sanction. Sarai Road, Basrah. —The first is the widening of the road through the Sarai (Basrah). This work comes under the head of military necessity, the object being to create a means whereby the fire-engine can get from its headquarters to Basrah City. An extension of this scheme provides for the widening of the road from the Serai onwards to Ottoman Bank Square. This extension has been voted by the Municipal Council as a work of primary importance and the necessary details in connection with compensation, &amp;c. are being taken in hand. Baluch Street.—The next scheme is “ the Baluch Street Improvement Scheme.” This scheme has been completed in all its details and now only awaits the sanction of higher authority for execution. It provides for widening the road between Baghdad Road and Baluch Street, and, when given effect to, will be a very great improvement. Baghdad Bridge. —The present Baghdad Bridge is merely a temporary structure. Mr. Meer recently offered £1,000 for the construction of a new bridge and plans have been drawn up. This scheme involves the widening of both approaches to the bridge and it is gratifying to be able to state that, for this purpose, Mr. Yarri of Messrs. E. D. Sasun, has made a gift to the municipality of a portion of the firm’s property involved in The scheme; and has promised to use his influence with the firm’s directors to bring about the presentation of a further piece of land involved, which it is anticipated will shortly be bought up by Sasun Brothers. It might here be mentioned that, for the most part, the leading people are quick to appreciate the great advantages which will accrue to themselves through municipal improvements of this nature. Club Road Improvement Scheme. —A scheme is in hand for the improvement of the road from Y.M.C.A. palm gardens past the Basrah Club, on to Qazarah,248 Church Street and Crooked Lane (‘Ashar) Improvement Scheme. —A scheme is in hand for the improvement of communication to and in Church Street. The preliminaries have been completed and sanction will shortly be asked. Jews' Bazaar. —This was recently destroyed by fire. D.A.D.W. (Civil) has prepared a plan for reconstruction to meet modern requirements, which has received the approval of the Military Governor. Improvement of Creeks. —It has not been possible to achieve anything in this direction, but that such improvements are necessary and must be undertaken at no very distant date is a fact which must be faced and provided for. Housing. —The occupation of Baghdad by British forces led to a serious rush down to Basrah, and when one considers the extent of this influx and the already congested state of Basrah and ‘Ashar it is remarkable how it has been met. It would be idle to deny that the civil population have suffered in the matter of comfort and convenience and in some cases to a small extent in business; but on the whole they have accepted the situation philosophically, and, though anxiously awaiting the time when they will once more be able to call their homes their own, they realise that the process of returning their homes to them must be a long one. In order to meet Military requirements in the first instance many, indeed almost all, of the better-class houses had to be commandeered, thus leading to considerable doubling up of the civil population. On the top of this came the rush of refugees from Baghdad, and to meet this it was found necessary to build a large encampment of huts, known as the Refugee Camp. The control of this camp was at first under taken by the Military Governor, and was subsequently handed over to the Municipal Commissioner. It comprises 832 huts, with accommodation for 3,183 souls. The cost of construction is a Military charge, and the small rental charged is collected by the Civil Department and credited to Military funds. It is satisfactory to note that, after allowing 10 per cent, for annual repairs, the rent collected and credited repre sents about 2 per cent, return on outlay. The actual amount taken on account of rent since the construction of the camp, 12 months ago, is Rs. 27,999/-, average of Rs. 2,155/- per mensem. Since the removal of restrictions upon travel, sums collected on account of rent will fall; and a further loss of income will be incurred through the Military Authorities’ demand for accommodation at very short notice in this camp for their repatriated prisoners of war. The refugees in this camp have been ever well cared for. The huts are comfortable, sanitary arrangements good, an ample supply of pipe water laid on, and the Civil Health Department have an all-time Medical Inspector attached to the camp. Billets. —As mentioned above, the great majority of the better-class houses in both Basrah and ‘Ashar had to be commandeered for the accommodation of British officers, subordinate staff, officers, &amp;e., &amp;e. This dates back considerably beyond the year under review, and it is only necessary to touch upon this question in order to state how the matter now stands. The question of rents paid for these houses has recently been reviewed. A Committee was formed for this purpose, and brought to light certain instances in which it was found that rents paid were insufficient. Recommendations for the equitable adjustment of this have been forwarded to the proper authorities. The Committee (partly Military, partly Civil) were, however, of opinion that, n there were any prospect of a return of their houses to owners within a reasonable period, it were better not to raise the question. The following system is followed on the question of repairs to billets :—In first instance, the land lord is given the option of undertaking repairs. Should he fail to do so within a reasonable period, the D.A.D.W. (Civil) is called upon to do the work, and his charges are deducted from the rent due to the landlord. inters—There are 39 Mukhtars in the municipality. Their duties have been clearly defined and are well known; and if, on a somewhat limited experience, 1 may venture an opinion, I would say that Mukhtars render very valuable service, a service indeed for the performance of which it would be difficult to find, at present, men so capable as themselves. At the same time, the position, particularly in respect of their emoluments, is unsatisfactory and needs remedying. The war being over, it will now be possible to take steps in this matter, and, in the first instance, I would advocate the principle of largely increasing the responsibilities of Mukhtars—converting them, as it were,into circle officers and building up for them, and under their control, a suitably paid subordinate staff. ♦ This will involve a considerable financial outlay, but it is unthinkable that, when peace reigns once more, we should attempt or desire to carry on the present scheme, viz., the employment of a large number of men in appointments partly honorary—though, by virtue of a totally inadequate monthly salary, not wholly so—and yet, not in any sense a paid appointment. Municipal Garden. —A scheme for a municipal nursery garden, for the growing of trees, shrubs and flowers which in due course will be distributed throughout the municipality, was evolved by the Military Governor; and an excellent site on Khandaq Creek was procured by agreement with a palm-garden owner, free of cost. The management of this garden is now in the hands of the Municipal Commissioner. Progress has been considerably retarded through want of a knowledgable head gardener. The appointment of a head gardener on Rs. 75/- per mensem has received approval, and an Arab was sent from Karbala to fill the appointment. He proved a complete failure and was returned. At the moment of writing, news has been received from Baghdad of the loan from Military of a B.O.R., a trained landscape gardener, and much is hoped for from this appointment. Meanwhile a not incon siderable progress has been made with a willing staff of six Arab gardeners under the supervision of a part-time B.O.R. on loan from the Agricultural Department: some thousands of trees are springing up, and a large number of flower seeds have been planted. Street Lighting. —Progress in this matter has been as poor in ‘Ashar as it has been good in Basrah. Basrah’s lighting may be called good. Very great improve ment is desirable in ‘Ashar, which at present is only lighted by a few sparsely separated dingy lamps, as compared with Basrah’s pearl lamps, which are very well reported on. The Health Officer has frequently called attention to the necessity for improve ment for the better conduct of sanitary arrangements, and a request was recently made to Local Army Headquarters for an all-night current to the existing installations. This could not be granted. Steps are now being taken to extend the lamp system. I confess to great reluctance to any considerable outlay in this direction now that the prospects of the municipality’s taking over the power-house looms very near. Lamps are of inferior quality and most costly, and with the increase of lamps a parallel increase in supervising establishment has to be considered. Still, some improvement is immediately necessary and is being under taken. Food Prices. —It will be noticed that during the last quarter of the year prices came down somewhat in almost every instance. As regards meat, vegetables and such like things, prices show a tendency to fall. The situation during the first half of December, as compared with the latter part of November, is about 1 anna to 1J annas in the rupee better. A considerable amount of labour has been given to watching food prices, ami I hold the opinion that bazaar profiteering does not exist to any great extent. The price of mutton (Rs. 8/- per waqiyah of 7| lbs.) alone shows no tendency to improve; but so long as people as a whole are rich as they now are, and the supply far short of the demand, it is bound to remain so. The forthcoming demobilisation in this country on the one hand and the possible famine conditions in India on the other, and their effect upon local food prices, will be watched with interest and will demand thoughtful attention. Census. —A census of the municipality is now in progress. It is hoped to be able to give figures before the close of the year. Basrah Development Committee. —This Committee, composed entirely of political and civil administration officers, with one civilian gentleman, all under the presidentship of A.Q.M.G., Base, held 10 meetings during the year. The efforts of the Committee were only partially successful; for, while called upon to discuss development, the Committee was not permitted to enter into any questions of post-bellum development. Hampered by such a restriction, its early demise was to be expected, and the end came in October 1918. Civil development was handed over, practically without restrictions, to the local head of the civil administration.Municipal Council.—The moment was opportune, for the Basrah Municipal Council had just come into being. This council as it exists at present requires to be looked upon as the beginning only of a bolder conception. It comprises eight of the leading gentlemen of the towns of Basrah and ‘Ashar, selected by the Municipal Commissioner. The Municipal Commissioner is the President, and the Assistant Military Governor acts as Secretary. Several council meetings have been held and various subjects touching the welfare of the municipality discussed. It is interesting to note how quickly this council found its feet after the first few meetings. At first they were slow to come forward with suggestions. Each meeting has seen a great increase in initiative and readiness for debate. This bodes well for the future of the new council, to come into being on 1st January 1919. • _ Recommendations.—\i the coming year is to be fruitful of the progress all would wish to see, the first and most important consideration is that Government should lose no time in giving expression to their policy regarding the future administration of the country. Much thought has been expended upon devising schemes for development on a large scale. Every opportunity has been taken by the Military Governor to obtain the advice of experts, whenever available, upon the large range of subjects under the heading of “ development.” Town planning has been fully discussed, water schemes, drainage, &amp;c.; but until our policy is clearly defined it is impossible to go beyond the stage of discussion. Our higher policy once declared, the next step (and the step which most concerns the subject under reference) will be to come to an early decision regarding the amount in pounds sterling which will be made available for works. The importance of settling this point early lies very greatly, I think, in the effect it will have upon the public* the more generous provision made by Government, the more will the public be inclined to open their bulging coffers and invest capital in schemes of town develop ment. Building sites will be eagerly sought, and money will be freely spent in constructing houses of imposing and beautiful design. Basrah and its 'people are na ^ anxi ous to spend freely. They are animated with the keenest desire that then* town should now come forward and take its place as a city of the world to which its geographical position entitles it.

Owners now pay Re. 1/- per horse per month as stabling rent, out of which four annas are paid to the owner of the site, while the balance is credited to the municipality towards the upkeep of the Civil Veterinary Dispensary. Some 400 horses are kept in the Public Gharry Stables, thus bringing some Rs. 300/- per month to the municipality. The site of the public gharry stables is not too good. In rainy season, the place being much below the level of the roads, becomes a veritable quagmire, and the horses suffer considerably. But it would be difficult to find a more convenient situation, and for the present steps are being taken to keep the water out by mud walls and improving the roofing. Civil Veterinary Dispensary .—A Civil Veterinary Dispensary has been established near Bait Naqib, Basrah City. A building and the necessary ground were given to the municipality free of rent by the Naqib, and the D.A.D.W., Civil, converted it into a not inferior hospital, at an initial expense of some Rs. 2,300/-. Repairs have been necessary from time to time, and a cholic box and dark room have been added. But the dispensary is already paying its way, as will be seen from the statement of its accounts in Appendix F. It has accommodation for 39 horses and, since its inception in June, has treated 250 horses. A scale of charges and further information will be found in Appendix H, while a classification of diseases, &amp;c., treated has been made in the same appendix. Attached to the Dispensary is an open isolation hospital in a date garden. Sheds for these isolation cases are now in process of erection, the materials having been procured from the destruction of Old gharry stables near Ottoman Square. The work at the Civil Dispensary is giving great satisfaction both to the authorities and to the gharry owners, and for this credit is due to Sgt. Favell. With the installation of a field forge, the municipality will become independent of the Military Authorities, and the revenue of the dispensary will be increased. Rack Renting .—If rents were high last year, they have become higher this year. The assessment of this year did its best to bring the municipal registers level with the actual state of affairs. But, although the increase in the assessed rents was on the whole nearly 100 per cent, above those of the previous year, although the policy of the Assistant Military Governor has generally been against allowing eviction unless some such omission as non-payment of rent, &amp;c., could be proved, although a 50 per cent, or 30 per cent, tax on the assessed rent was levied in the cases of houses which were wholly or partly converted into godowns, in spite of the Rent Restriction Proclamation of July, it has been found impossible to stop rack renting. But it must not be thought that all the sin is on the part of the landlords. In the general prosperity of Basrah, tenants have been willing to pay much more than the assessed rents, and it seems to me that, even were there rack-renting laws, it would be impossible, in the combined circumstances of a prospering Basrah and a scarcity of houses, to prevent tenants from paying and landlords from accepting more than the legal rent. People will tell one that rents nowadays, compared with pre-war rents, are absurdly high; but I think the philosophic calm with which they will pay these absurd rents is the outcome, to a great extent, of the knowledge that they can afford them in these days of comparative prosperity. Certainly the Rent Restriction Proclamation has failed entirely to keep rents down. It would be no exaggeration to sav that not a single tenant in Basrah pays only the legal rent, nor would a single tenant bring before the Military Governor a landlord for having taken or demanded more than such rent. If one tenant will not pay what the landlord asks, another will, and the Military Governor will never know. By the Rent Restriction Rules, registration of lease is optional j but, even weie it compulsory, the state of affairs would not be much better, for the reason explained above and because the Arab is not naturally a litigious being and would rather enjoy the excitement of bargaining for his rent than have it fixed for him by an outsider, while the Jews and Christians are small, almost self-contained, communities with a laissez faire attitude towards the rest of their members. Taxation. At the beginning of the year the third house rent assessment was made The result was that the total of assessed rents rose from Rs 510,000/- of the previous year to Rs. 960,000/-, and an increase of some-Rs. 45,000/- by way of house tax was brought to municipal revenues. With effect from 1st April, the Military Governor ordered that, in the case of houses of an annual assessed rental of less than Rs 120/-, the 10 per cent, house tax should be suspended and a tax levied of not less than Rs. 12/- per annum, in this way bringing such houses on a level with sarifahs. Meanwhile, the outlying villages were brought under a hut252 l 1 i sanitary cess tax. At first, this was levied at the rate of Re. 1/- per sarifah; but later the Military Governor altered it to Re. 1/— per household. While coffee-shop licences were taxed, if the liquor were kept in a shop the usual shop tax was charged, while the 30 per cent, godown tax was levied if the liquor were kept in a house. In view of the fact that coffee-houses have a tendency to spread their benches over the street, whereby municipal ground is consumed and traffic thoroughfares curtailed, it has been proposed that coffee-shop licences should revert to the former scale, which was about 40 per cent, higher than the present scale. Coffee-houses are very paying concerns, and can well afford the increase. A small search fee of Re. 1/- has been ifnposed by way of fine for the extra work caused by hawkers, &amp;c., who lose their licences. But the success of the year under the head of taxation has been the abolition of the farming of the ground rent tax and the 2J per cent, brokerage on animals sold in Suq-al-Dijaj. The collection of these two taxes is now in the hands of a municipal tax-collector, who in one month collected an amount equal to the price paid for the farm for a quarter. Pauper Burial and Poor Relief .—During the past year Rs. 3,186/12/-, exclusive of Rs. 15/- paid monthly to an undertaker, have been expended on pauper burial by the Basrah municipality, this figure representing the burial expenses of nearly 300 paupers. The tendency is for this form of relief to increase. In Turkish times there was very little pauper burial. The reason for the increase under the present administration seems to me to lie in the fact that Government has established a civil hospital and an isolation hospital. Poor people who die in these institutions are left by their friends and relations to the charity of the municipality. It practically never happens that poor people who die outside these institutions are buried by the municipality. Such being the case, I am of opinion that, in default of preventive checks to be exercised at the isolation hospital and the civil hospital, the various communities of Basrah should subscribe a proportion of the annual expenditure. The great majority of paupers buried by the municipality are Mohammedans, and I think that the municipality should receive help from the Moslem Relief Fund. For the present, the monthly allowance to the undertaker has been cut, in view of the fact that he is paid for each burial, and it has been arranged that the civil jail shall bury the paupers who die there. Subsistence cases and poor relief have been transferred to the Municipal Commissioner, c Ashar. But sometimes this office, in exceptional circumstances, releases a poor widow &amp;c.' from house tax or some other such imposition of Government. Trade.—!t is not easy to write in detail under this head, because statistics are too difficult to obtain. The piece goods trade, which makes or mars Basrah, has flourished all the year. Prices have been high and the merchants have made big profits. But the signing of the Armistice with Germany has caused for the moment a complete suspension of piece goods trade. Merchants have on their hands large stocks of bales, for which there is no market. There are no buyers at the old prices in Basrah, and the communications and transport to Mosul and Persia, the chief market for piece goods, are not yet available to any extent There is complete confidence among the bigger merchants that the market will rise again withm a month or two, because of the urgent need of enemy countries for cotton goods, the probability of a big rise m the cost of labour, which would prevent cotton and r th 0 pNnrfih k T1 pre ' war pn( k e ’ a f d the eventual opening of the roads to Persia t But tlie smaIler men &gt; acquired their bales on compialas, ’ will be broken if they cannot sell now and in a favourable market. For it must be remembered that the success of the piece goods trade durmg the war had induced a considerable number of smaller men to sneculate and to borrow much beyond their means. A scheme has been stS syndicate of the bigger merchants, with a big capital, and to put this syndicate on the market as one buyer and seller. The syndicate will buy from the smaller e me T5 r ^ ^ “ n °l to sdl * Price to be ZtL K rl th ( V There , 1S much t0 be s aid for this idea. But it means the abolition of the smaller merchants and the concentration of the piece coods trade in a few hands, a result which might one day develop into a dangerous condole! le scheme has not yet advanced beyond the stage of discussion. But it seems to me the solution of the whole question lies in the speedy opening of the Persian market Were it possible to do that at once the situation would become normal again, there would be no need of a combine, and the smaller merchants wouid rema n During the process of demobilisation, when trucks and ships will be cominv downto Basrah loaded, but returning empty, Government should be able to give considerable help in the matter of transport. Coinage .—Early in the year large quantities of Turkish silver and copper coins appeared in Basrah. Baghdad had put a check on their circulation, and Basrah merchants bought stocks of them at something like 40 per cent, below par value and attempted to circulate them at par value in the Basrah markets. This action caused great discontent, the shopkeepers refusing to take the coin except at a discount. The Military Governor had to interfere. He ordered that no one should be compelled to accept the small Turkish coins. The result was a disappearance, as speedy as their introduction, of these coins from Basrah circulation. Record of Rights .—In April a “ yoklamah ” of Basrah City began. So far the Sif quarter has been completed, and the mukhtar of the quarter gave very valuable assistance. Oil .—In the early part of the year, owing to the great consumption of oil by the Government, the price of the commodity in the bazaars rose rapidly. Oil dealers took to hoarding oil, and it became impossible to purchase oil even at the rate of Rs. 20/- per tin. The question became almost a crisis. Government arranged that Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Co. should purchase oil at rates fixed by Government and should be the sole suppliers at a fixed rate of Rs. 3/4/- per tin to selected retailers, who, in their turn, were to sell at Government rates. 6. Judicial : (1) Judicial .—The Senior Judicial Officer is submitting separately a report on the magisterial work which has been conducted under my control as District Magistrate under the Criminal Procedure Code, and I need not repeat here what has been dealt with elsewhere. Suffice it to say in general terms that the people have been of orderly behaviour in town and district and given me no cause for anxiety. As Military Governor I tried 43 cases during the year, none of serious nature. The Deputy Military Governor, ‘Ashar, tried 540 petty cases—drunkenness, being in possession of Government property, contravention of other military rules, and breach of licence regulations being the common offences. The Assistant Military Governor, Basrah, disposed of 231 cases—drunkenness, cruelty to animals, rash driving, and breach of sanitary rules, being the principal offences. Commandants of the Military Encampment Areas, who have powers of punishment in respect of inhabitants of the country, dealt with 224 cases, the common offences being damaging bunds, being in possession of Government rations, Army clothing, drunkenness, breach of licence rules, neglect of duty, breach of rules regarding entry in prohibited area. The total fines collected in the Military Governor’s area was Rs. 27,656/10/-. In the Basrah Sanjaq the Mudirs have used the magisterial powers with which they have been invested and have imposed fines to the extent of some Rs. 4,000/—. As Political Officer I tried and convicted 10 accused and the Assistant Political Officer, Basrah Sanjaq, tried and convicted 33 persons. The offences were chiefly against Army labour rules. The Assistant Political Officer, Zubair, tried only two cases during the year. Tribal Disputes Regidation .—Two murders occurred in the Fao Nahiyah, and in both cases the accused absconded into Persia. Two others were committed near Abul Khasib, and, though full and prompt inquiry was made by both police and Political Officers, the accused have not been arrested. In one of these cases it was clear that information was being withheld by the inhabitan^ of the village concerned, upon whom a heavy collective fine has been imposed. The inhabitants paid according to their status: a fellah Rs. 15/-, a watchman Rs. 30/- a small mallak Rs. 60/-, a big landowner Rs. 150/-; a total sum of Rs. 9,525/- in all has been paid. The conditions under which fellahs live during the date season in remote unguarded huts among the palm trees make the committal of such ciimes easy, and detection extremely difficult. Only one large case of theft occurred, m which a helium is alleged to have been cut adrift during the night and robbed of Rs. 11,000/-. No evidence of any kind is forthcoming. „ . u , , There has been little tribal crime during the year. Security has been taken as a preventive measure from several habitual offenders in Harthah and Abul Khasib. Under the Tribal Civil and Criminal Disputes Regulation (the revised issue of which is now being followed) 23 cases were registered and 20 cases disposed of. Most came from the Harthah Nahiyah; 16 cases were referred to a majlis and settled; four were referred to shara‘. In one an accused (one of the Ma dan tube)254 was sentenced to three months’ rigorous imprisonment in addition to the majlis decision, as the accused absconded and disobeyed the order of the Political Officer. There were seven miscellaneous petitions regarding refusal to marry according to tribal custom. Both the parties in all the cases came to a settlement when they were referred to their Shaikhs through Mudirs. Details of cases settled by majlis and approved of by the Political Officer are as follows :— Offence. No. of Cases. Murder - - - - - - -3 Theft and mischief - - - - - - 1 Robbery - - - - - - -1 Adultery - - ' - - - -2 Divorce - - - - - - -1 Elopement - - - - - - -1 Dispossession by use of criminal force causing breach of peace 1 Against marriage according to tribal law - - - 5 In one case the parties agreed to settle the dispute by going to Karbala and swearing at the shrine of ‘Abbas. It should be noted that out of the three cases of murder attributed to tribal disputes, one refers to murders committed twenty and six years ago by both parties, who were tribes of Qaramshah of Nahr ‘Umar and Hamadnah of Qurmat ‘Ali. In a case of breach of peace, one accused was discharged and two were bound over to keep the peace for one year. 7. Education.— Education is now under a qualified Director and we have a feeling of confidence that the difficulties which have stood in the way of advance will be surely overcome. There is lively interest everywhere in education and trained teachers have been made available to meet the demand of the villages for schools and to improve the condition of the Government schools now in existence. The American Mission boys’ school in ‘Ashar continues its excellent work in primary and secondary teaching, with 100 boys on the roll. The same Mission has a small girls’ school in Basrah City teaching the three Rs. and sewing. I am particularly anxious to see established a Government girls’ school for Mahommedans. a school for the daughters of men of good social standing who could afford to pay high fees for its upkeep. Some of the leading men of the town have intimated their wish to support such an institution. A college for the sons of well-to-do men of all denominations seems very necessary. A central college at Baghdad such as is under the consideration of the Director may suffice, but I think we shall have to have our own institution here. I quote below extracts from the reports of Assistant Political Officers :— “ Basrah City Non-Government Schools .—There are in Basrah four schools for boys and two for gills. Of the boys schools, the best is the Albert School, under the Carmelite Fathers. It has an attendance of about 100 boys. The boys are very keen and work hard. Their discipline is excellent, and the Fathers are to be complimented on their work. The Fathers are now starting evening classes in French, Arabic, English, bookkeeping and shorthand; but are badly 'in need of electric light to carry out this evening study. The Chaldean School is insignificant, having not more than 25 unhappy-looking boys in attendance. I have an idea that discipline sometimes in this school verges on bullying. I should like to see the school closed down. “ Ttie Jewish Boys’ School has an attendance of over 600 boys. It is very much overcrowded and understaffed, and in the preparatory classes there is an insufficiency of instruction. But under these difficulties the school does good work. 4 ‘ The Carmelite Convent School is hopelessly overcrowded. The French Sisters do admirable work there with 300 girls and small boys. Like the Albert School it stands in need of funds and support. The Jewish Girls’ School has an attendance of some 220 girls. The attendance has considerably decreased during the year owing to the return of Jewish families to Baghdad. •‘On the whole there is a great insufficiency of education in Basrah. The suggestion put forward by the President of the Court of Wards for the beginning of evening classes tor adult boys deserves recognition, and would, I think orove a success, ’ ^“Government and Waqf Schools .—The Abdul Khasib School is in a flourishing condition, and has been relieved of the close proximity of the police station which hampered it before. It still requires further accommodation, and I have asked the Director of Education for permission to build three new rooms at a cost of about Rs. 3,000/-. Nearly all the boys are Sunni, and there are very few non-Mussulmans. An attempt has been made to interest them in gardening, but has not been very successful so far. The school in Basrah does not compare favourably with the Abdul Khasib School: it has suffered from a bad position in the town, and from competition with the flourishing Jewish and Armenian schools; but a new building is being found for it, and there is every hope of an early improvement. In the middle of November a new school was opened in ‘Ashar, and in less than a month attracted 90 pupils, Mohammedans, with three exceptions. By the end of the year this number will have doubled and the school will have outgrown the billet which has been allotted to it. The Head Master has come from Zubair and seems a keen and capable man. All three schools suffer from shortage of books (especially in the primary classes) and lack of playgrounds. The first defect is due to war conditions and will now soon be made good; the second is a more difficult problem, which cannot well be solved until the schools are housed in properly constructed buildings of their own. The presence of Quran teachers has proved a great induce ment to parents to send their boys to school; these men were formerly appointed and paid by the Waqf Department, but from 1st October they have been taken on to the establishment of the schools and draw Rs. 85/- per month. Meetings of Mukhtars have been held and they have been urged to use their influence in the cause of education. There are several Quran schools in Basrah and ‘Ashar, and one at Sibah opposite ‘Abadan; these are controlled by Waqf, and at the end of the month of November the Department re-opened a large Quran school in the Mishraq quarter, which had been temporarily closed. These and a few other private institutions form the nucleus of what may be flourishing Government schools ere long; but, as Mr. Bullard noted in 1915, little progress can be expected from untrained teachers. During the year six young men from the Sanjaq have been sent to Baghdad for training in the Normal School there, and when they return to us it will be possible to make a real advance in opening schools in outlying districts. “ Zubair .—The Assistant Political Officer of Zubair reports that the Shaikh has shown little interest in the school there. It has, however, done fairly well under existing circumstances and it will have its share in the coming education prosperity and do much for the future welfare of this desert town.” 8a. Sanitation. —The 62 following paragraphs are contributed by Captain F. T. H. Wood, M.D., D.P.H., Health Officer of Basrah and Ashar; followed, again, by 20 paragraphs contributed by Captain I. Mackenzie, R.A.M.C. (S.R.), Port Health Officer :— (1) Area .—The boundaries of the Basrah municipality remain as described in the last annual report and enclose an area of about 18 square miles. In general, the same districts are occupied by military and civil populations respectively as was the case in 1917; the civil being mainly resident in the district lying between Khorah Creek on the South, Robat Creek on the North, the river on the East, and a line joining the extremities of Khorah Creek and Robat Creek on the West. In the 4 square miles thus contained the principal civil development has been the completion of 200 huts on the North bank of ‘Ashar Creek for occupation by refugees from Baghdad. Outside this area (with which this report mainly deals) and excluding land occupied by the military, the ground is intersected with creeks and irrigation channels for cultivation as date gardens, with hamlets and villages dotted throughout. Early in the year the sanitary survey of these villages was completed, the recommendations made were approved, and the necessary work has been finished in Tanumah and Qardalan on the left bank of the river, and in Akwat Raznah and Kut-al-Hajaj on the right bank near Basrah proper. (2) Population .—Last year the population was estimated at 59,000, of whom 26,000 were living in Basrah City and its immediate neighbourhood, with 19,000 in ‘Ashar and its immediate neighbourhood. These figures were derived from rough corrections applied to the 1916 census after consideration of the numbers obtainable from villages for labour purposes and of the number of immigrants from Baghdad. A further formal census was taken by the Municipal Commissioner in December 1918, and the population was then computed at 25,382 in and around Basrah (including the refugee camps), with 14,292 in the Ashar neighbourhood,256 and the total in the whole municipal area at 49,194. The decrease is in part due to the exodus to Baghdad which followed the removal of travel restrictions in November. (3) Establishment of Health Department .—The post of Health Officer, Basrah and ‘Ashar, is a whole-time appointment, the duties of which include those of the Medical Officer of Health of an English town, with the addition of the collection and disposal of refuse. The Health Officer is assisted by a second Medical Officer, Capt. H. M. Jackson filling the post until he was invalided to India in July; Capt. J. W. Patterson succeeded him as assistant M.O.H. on 2nd July and did valuable work in that capacity and as deputy during the Health Officer s absence on leave.' Capt. Patterson, unfortunately, contracted influenza on 8th October and was invalided to India on 24th November, and since October the Health Officer has been without a medical assistant. (4) The Health Officer was at first assisted in the technical sanitary work by three N.C.O.s of No. 99 Sanitary Section (formerly in civil sanitary employ in England), and such work suffered in the second half of the year through the invaliding to India of one of these N.C.O.s in June and the procedure on leave to England of a second in October. (5) The conservancy arrangements continue to be supervised in Basrah by an Indian Inspector, Mr. P. B. Dalvi. In ‘Ashar they were in the hands of Sgt. A. J. Horne, R.A.M.C., until 6th October, when the department suffered a severe loss by the death of this N.C.O., who had rendered good service in the capacity of Conservancy Superintendent for a period of three years. Sgt. Horne was succeeded by another British rank who had been working in the Department since February 1917. (6) The remainder of the sanctioned staff, 478 in all, and the transport are as follows ; it may be noted, however, that although the number sanctioned exceeds last year’s figures on account of new work in the refugee camps and outlying villages, the actual number of employees on 31st December w T as only 338, as against 346 in the previous year :— ‘Ashar with Basrah with Refugee outlying Camps. Villages. Superior Staff — Clerical - Sanitary inspectors Women health visitors - Sanitary orderlies (B.O.R.Rs.) For Collection of Refuse — (i) Arab — Supt. of sweepers Area jamadars - Road sweepers - Carters - - - - Donkey boys Cesspit jamadar Cesspit coolies - - - (ii) Indian — Sweeper drivers - For Destruction of Refuse — Incinerator men - Slaughter-house coolies For Latrines and Incinerators — (i) Arab — Jamadar - Latrine sweepers - (i) Indian — Latrine sweepers - 1 3 1 5 2 3 2 2 1 10 56 6 38 1 8 1 8 50 6 44 1 9 3 7 3 8 5 — 1 42 33 17 8M iscellaneous — Sanitary sub-inspectors Disinfecting men - Anti-malaria coolies Bhoosa carriers Syces - Rat-catchers Messenger - Watchmen - - - Labour corps coolies ‘Ashar with Basrah with Refugee outlying Camps. Villages. 1 1 10 20 2 — 1 4 1 — 1 1 3 1 - 25 — Transport — Wooden rubbish carts Open iron filth carts Crowley carts Bullocks Horses Donkeys Mules - 13 3 3 33 1 29 8 5 3 6 9 9 25 6 (7) Suggestions as to the supervisory establishment required after withdrawal of the military personnel from civil employment were put forward in November. They provide for the union of the two departments, with the appointment of one British Chief Sanitary Inspector in control of the technical work and one Conservancy Superintendant in charge of refuse disposal. In addition to the appointment of suitable men to these posts, there is also the difficulty of the menial establishment to be faced—the removal of travel restrictions in November imme diately resulted in the departure to Baghdad of some 30 Arabs who had been working as sweepers and sanitary coolies; while the replacement of the 25 Indian sweepers by local labour will not easily be made. (8) Vital Statistics .—In January the Military Governor ordered notification of births to be made by the householders, through the mukhtar, to the Health Department within seven days of birth; but the scheme has not been a success, an average of 12 births only being reported weekly when at least 30 or 40 might be expected. An improvement has been sought, but the Mukhtars have pointed out that their relationship to the people is altering, and that in the towns proper the mukhtar is less in touch with comings and goings in his district than was formerly the case; accordingly, an attempt will be made to enforce notification direct to the Health Department by the parent or the person in attendance on the mother at the time of birth. (9) The practice with regard to death registration is that the mukhtar is respons ible that no unnotified burial occurs in his area, and the watchmen on the ‘Ashar cemetery require the production of a pass provided by this Department before allowing burial to take place. These passes are issued either on the certificate ot a medicaf practitioner or after enquiries made by one of the civil sanitary inspectors. (10) In the ‘Ashar district it is believed that few unnotified deaths now occur, inasmuch as there is but one main burial-ground, and on this it is practicable to keep a watchman; in Basrah, however, the position is not so satisfactory m that there are some 16 burial grounds, which it is not possible to supervise. Importance is attached to this matter, not merely on statistical grounds, but because m a country where notification is in its infancy a rise in the death rate may be the first indication of an outbreak of infectious disease. A recommendation was accordingly made early in the year that the smaller of these burial grounds should be abandoned, and that burials should be allowed only in specially authorised cemeteries, over which this Department could keep a watch. Although for the time various considerations have prevented this recommendation being approved the recognition of five cemeteries only—one each for Jews, Christians, Sunnis, the Jafanyah subsect and the Shaikh subsect of the Shi‘ahs—should be aimed at. (11) An analysis of the death register shows that in 19 per cent, of the cases in ‘Ashar and 58 per cent, of the cases in Basrah, the cause of death was certified by a258 medical practitioner; in the remaining cases it is not claimed that a diagnosis is possible from the vague histories of illness obtained by the inspector, but a rough grouping of the commonest fatal illnesses is as under :— ‘Ashar. Basrah. Total deaths analysed - _ 1,225 1,465 Respiratory diseases* - - 124 49{ Intestinal diseases! - 73 694 Senile decay - 95 894 Malaria and “ fever ” - - 95 59{ Cholera - 107 63 Plague - 71 121 Small-pox - 58 31 Influenza - 279 450 (12) The death rates both for ‘Ashar and Basrah compare unfavourably with the 1917 figures, the rise being due to an outbreak of cholera in May and of influenza in September and October. The average weekly deaths in ‘Ashar and Basrah respectively were 14-0 and 11-0 in the first quarter, 30-0 and 28-5 in the second, 16*2 and 23-9 in the third, and 36-0 and 51-8 in the last quarter of the year. Crude death rates have been calculated on the basis of the December census figures, although it is probable that these figures were exceeded during the second and third quarters of the year by two or three thousand. These crude death rates are, for ‘Ashar: 50-9 per 1,000 for the first quarter, 109-1 per 1,000 for the second, 58- 8 per 1,000 for the third, and 130-9 per 1,000 for the last quarter, or 85-2 per 1,000 for the whole year; and for Basrah: 22-5 per 1,000 for the first quarter, 59- 3 per 1,000 for the second, 49-7 per 1,000 for the third, 107-9 per 1,000 for the last quarter, or 58-6 per 1,000 for the whole year. (13) Infantile Mortality .—In the absence of any reliable record of births, it is regretted that the infantile mortality rate, which is presumably high, cannot be calculated; but 14 per cent, of the registered deaths occurred in' infants below the age of 12 months. A rough classification of the causes of death in these infants shows 67 per cent, to have been due to inanition, 6 per cent, to intestinal diseases, 12 per cent, to respiratory diseases, and 8 per cent, to small-pox. The appointment of two additional w*omen health visitors wall enable advantage to be taken of future notifications of births, in that advice and instruction will be given on infant care as well as on the general sanitation of the house. (14) Infectious Diseases. The scheme of notification of infectious diseases bv medical practitioners, mukhtars and others, instituted by order of the Military Governor, dated 26th October 1916, remains in force. Notification is not vet satisfactory, but consistent attempts have been made throughout the year by pro clamation, by adveitisement, and by prosecution of defaulters, to bring home to the public the importance of complying with the order, and it is believed that some improvement has been effected. Further, an article on vaccination was written for the local newspaper at the time small-pox was prevalent, and Arabic leaflets, giving advice on precautions to be taken, were largely distributed during the cholera and plague seasons. (15) After notification, a search is made in the neighbourhood for unreported cases, and the patients and, where necessary, the contacts—are removed to the civil isolation hospital. Remaining contacts are treated bv vaccination or inocu lation if applicable, and the usual disinfection is done by' this Department 4t present the Department relies on the Military for the loan of a motor ambulance for removal of infectious cases, and arrangements for purchase should shortly be made. (lb) The unsatisfactory situation and structure of the present civil isolation hospital were pointed out in the last annual report, and in February the Military Governor and A. D.M. S., Base, approved the suggestions of the Civil Surgeon and the Health Officer as to the minimum alterations required to put the hospital on a more satisfactory basis. These alterations were in part carried out; but during the rams m November a large portion of the hospital collapsed, leaving only 20 beds avail able. In vi ew of the fact that earlier in the year accommodation for * Including phthisis, excluding influenza. finding cholera, f Figures for six months only.80 patients had been required, it became necessary to take immediate action, and it was agreed to erect a tented hospital on the same site to accommodate 100 patients. This is looked upon as a temporary measure, and a modern isolation hospital, with suitable quarters for staff, capable of expansion in times of epidemic and on a convenient site a short distance from Basrah, is urgently required. (17) Plague .—‘Ashar had remained free from plague from June 1917 until the notification of a case from the police station on ‘Ashar Creek on 20th January 1918; eight further cases occurred in March, and the outbreak assumed epidemic pro portions in the second half of April. From 1st April until 21st May, 81 cases in all were reported and all four quarters of the town, together with its purely Arab environs Umm-al-Dijaj, Mahallat-al-Sai and Qazarah, were affected—a quarter of the cases arising in the low-lying reed hut encampment at Mahallat-al-Sai. The notified cases showed a progressive decline weekly during June, in which month 25 cases only were registered, and the epidemic may be considered to have come to an end in July, although two further cases occurred during August and a third in September, making a total for the year of 121. (18) Basrah City continued free from plague from June 1917 until April 1918: nine cases were reported. In May, however, the disease flared up, and the weekly notifications until the end of June were, respectively, 12, 35, 39, 40, 23, 30, 21, 14 and 7; seven further cases occurred during July and August, with a doubtful final case in November, making a total for the year of 236 cases. The spot map prepared shows the main infected areas to have been Suq-al-Dijaj in the centre of the town, and Mujasah in the north-west quarter. (19) Apart from the outbreaks in the town proper, Akhwat Raznah (a hut village with population of 2,000 to 3,000) was severely attacked by plague in April and May, and reports were received of excessive sickness and many deaths. This village had not previously been under sanitary control, and it needed several visits to induce confidence ; but, once this was established, fresh cases to the number of 20 daily were discovered. Inoculation was successfully offered, and later, by arrange ment with the Civil Surgeon, a temporary dispensary was established on the spot. (20) The above figures compare unfavourably with the 40 cases of plague reported in ‘Ashar and Basrah during 1917; but, as noted in the last annual report, with rats numerous and infected foci well scattered it needed but some additional factor for the production of a really serious epidemic. The usual rat-reduction measures were carried on throughout the year, but no rat caught after the middle of June was found to be suffering from plague. (21) Cholera .—In ‘Ashar the first case of cholera was notified on 13th May, and this was speedily followed by the sharpest outbreak that has occurred since the British occupation; and by the end of that month 131 cases were registered, the maximum in any one day being 17. This outbreak may then be considered to have expired, although further cases were reported in small numbers each month until the end of the year, by which time 171 cases had occurred. A study of the incidence of both civil and military cases was made by the Officer Commanding the Central Laboratory at the Base, and he reported that the epidemic appeared to have started as the result of the infection of the ‘Ashar Creek by a military case at its mouth on 12th May; and the subsequent grouping of cases supported his view that the river and creek waters were the source of the epidemic. (22) In Basrah the first case was notified on 16th May, but, although 48 cases were reported by the end of the month, the disease did not assume the proportions of the ‘Ashar outbreak; 35 other cases occurred during June, followed by odd notifications monthly to the end of the year. A large part of the Basrah water supply had been obtained from the municipal stand pipes during the whole of this year, and to this may be ascribed the slightness of the outbreak, which in general was limited to the poorer, dirty and careless classes having few facilities for the clean storage of either food or water—the overcrowded Jews’ quarter in the centre of the town suffering heavily for this reason. (23) Small-pox .—The mild outbreak of small-pox which had started in December 1917 died out by the end of January, and ‘Ashar may be said to have been free from small-pox from then up to midsummer, only 18 cases being reported by the end of July; from then onwards, however, cases occurred more frequently, the greatest incidence being in Mahallat-al-Sai village, where the disease originated, in theneighbouring refugee camp, and only to a small extent in the town proper. By the end of the year, 98 cases had been reported. (24) In Basrah an average of four or five cases monthly was reported throughout the first three quarters, but in October the numbers increased, and in all 110 cases occurred. From evidence which was forthcoming at intervals, it would appear that small-pox was continually being introduced into surrounding villages from places lower down the river, and that the town was infected and reinfected in the same way. For example, the Assistant Political Officer reported in July excessive sickness among the Bani Hawa encampment near Qurmat ‘Ali, and in August among the villages of Qardalan and Salhiyah, and inspection by this Department resulted in the discovery of a large number of cases. When village epidemics were thus discovered, this Department arranged for vaccination on the spot. (25) Difficulties arise in the control of small-pox in Basrah from the light estimation in which the disease is held by the public generally, and from their confidence in the efficacy of the one vaccination in childhood which is commonly practised, except among the poorer Mahommedans. Every endeavour has, however, been made to bring home to the people the necessity of complying with the Military Governor’s order requiring notification of infectious disease, and somewhat better results are now being obtained, in part due to successful prosecutions undertaken. As regards vaccination of contacts in the town, it is difficult to get attendance at the hospitals or dispensaries, and the Woman Health Visitor has been sent into the homes for this purpose. (26) Malaria .—The ordinary anti-malarial measures were continued in force from preceding years, and wells, cesspools and borrow pits were sprayed with oil at frequent intervals. Water in the domestic wells in Basrah showed considerable culex breeding, and opportunities were taken for the abolition of such wells in the city, while new constructions were forbidden. It is not possible to give an accurate statement as to the deaths due to malaria, but, including those registered as “ fever,” malaria was ascribed as the cause of death in 7 per cent, of cases in ‘Ashar and in 5 per cent, of cases in Basrah. (27) Influenza .—The pandemic of influenza, which, beginning in Spain in the spring, spread northward through Europe and eastward to India, began to be evident in the Basrah civil area in the first week of September, co-incident with a general outbreak throughout the whole of the Base. The death rate rose sharply to a figure not previously recorded even during the cholera epidemic in May; and, during the first week in October, when the epidemic was at its height in Basrah City’ 164 deaths were registered (the average weekly death rate in 1917 being 10*3). The infection in ‘Ashar was slightly retarded and first showed its influence on the death rate in the first week of October, the height of the curve being reached in the following week with 75 deaths (as against the 1917 weekly average of 13-3). (28) From observations collected from the civil hospital and from local practi tioners, it was found that about one-fourth or one-fifth of the cases were complicated with pneumonia, and to this the high mortality may be ascribed. In all it is estimated that the epidemic, which lasted seven or eight weeks, resulted in about 700 deaths in the urban district alone. (29) Puerperal Fever.—During the last six months of the year in Basrah (earlier records were lost in the Health Office fire), 16 deaths were registered as due to puerperal fever, with 18 deaths during the year in ‘Ashar. In October the Civil burgeon, Basrah, raised the question as to the necessity of the registration of midwives in practice, and as to the importance of superseding the present “ iiddah ” or grandmother, by women who had received an elementary nursing and obstetric trammg at the civil hospital ; and as a result the following scheme, framed by the Ciyfi Surgeon and the Health Officer, was approved by the Military Governor and will shortly be acted upon :— (i) Registration with the Health Department of present midwives, i.e., of women who prove that they have attended women in childbirth in the past, and who signify their intention of continuing to do so for gain. (n) Engagement by Civil Surgeon of two trained midwives for domiciliary ^ e T? C u Ur S ged t0 take pUpils in the hos Pital, who would be admitted to the Midwives Roll after approval by Civil Surgeon. (in) Inspection of midwiyes, who would be required to conform to a code of rules, and who would be able to call on Civil Hospital for help in difficult cases.(iv) Extension and enforcement of present scheme of notification of births. (v) Appointment of two additional women health visitors—who will act as inspectors of midwives, and advise on infant care and domestic sanitation generally. (30) Venereal Disease. —An enquiry was conducted in July and August by the Civil Surgeon, in conjunction with the Health Officer, into the incidence of venereal disease among the prostitutes in Basrah and 161 women and girls were examined. Twenty clinical cases of primary or secondary syphilis were discovered (Wassermann reaction not being done), together with 102 cases—62 per cent.—of gonorrhoea, all diagnosed by bacteriological examination and most showing obvious clinical signs also. (31) It was felt that the concentration of the majority of the prostitutes into one quarter, and the comparatively small amount of irregular intercourse among the women outside the quarter, rendered the problem of the control of venereal disease easier than in a European community. Accordingly, proposals were again put forward for the institution of periodical inspections of these women, combined with treatment in a lock hospital; a house was taken for this purpose, but the scheme is not yet working owing to the lack of suitable staff. (32) Collection of Refuse. —For the purpose of street cleaning, ‘Ashar and Basrah towns are divided into nine districts, over each of which is placed an Arab Jamadar responsible for the sweeper personnel. A reduction has been made in the number of Jamadars without any detriment to the results obtained, owing to the fact that Arab supervisory labour of this class does not prove very satisfactory. (33) The same type of refuse bin (a galvanised iron sheet rolled on itself) is in use in the streets as in previous years. Refuse is collected from these bins twice or three times daily, and is taken on carts or on donkeys or mules from ‘Ashar to the incinerating grounds in the cemetery, and from Basrah to one or other of the seven dumping grounds, five of which are provided with incinerators. The average amount of rubbish so collected daily amounts to 131 donkey loads and 25 cart loads in ‘Ashar and 173 donkey loads and 30 cart loads in Basrah—or, roughly, 35 tons per day. (34) Destruction of Refuse. —Refuse thus collected is dealt with in ‘Ashar on the open ground adjoining the civil cemetery, on one closed and five open grid incinerators; a satisfactory though bulky ash remains and is used in reclaiming low-lying ground in the neighbourhood. During the year some 7,000 cart loads and 26,000 donkey loads were thus dumped, and an extensive area adjoining the butchery was raised above flood level. (35) In Basrah a portion of the refuse is directly dumped without incineration, but the greater part first goes through incinerators; as, in ‘Ashar, low-lying ground is chosen for this work—a departure from the Turkish practice which resulted in the building up of several mounds on the town outskirts—and the dumping areas have been so chosen that the completed work lessens opportunities for fly-breeding, widens the road or prepares sites for future buildings. , (36) In April it became necessary on account of the prevalence of glanders to remove the gharri horses from their stables in the city and collect them, to the number of 300 in lines between ‘Ashar and Basrah. As horse manure is not much used in the date gardens, the sanitary disposal of the litter was an important point, and 300 square feet of grid incinerator were asked for. Pending completion of this, the litter has been in part burnt on the neighbouring refuse incinerator and the rest has been dumped in nullahs and covered with earth; an attempt made to secure the biological treatment by close packing was abandoned owing to the lack of intelligent supervision One further difficulty always met with in the Basrah stables arises from the practice of keeping a certain amount of litter on the premises as bedding for the animals, straw not being available. (37) The ‘objections to the indefinite continuance of the present method of refuse disposal are obvious, and a scheme for the installation of refuse bins in the houses instead of the streets, for the carriage of refuse by light railway to a point on the desert outside Basrah City, and for its incineration there m high temperature destructors is under consideration. It must be pointed out, however, that, although such a scheme is scientifically sound and would add to the amenities of the town, its adoption would result in a heavy initial outlay as well as a greater cost of upkeep. F rp o X IO 1162—1262 (38) Conservancy. —An important section of the Department’s work consists in the maintenance of public latrines and the disposal of excreta therefrom, as well as from the private cesspit latrines possessed by all permanent dwelling-houses. (39) The type of public latrine used in the ‘Ashar district is two cut kerosene tins, one behind the other, with a raised concrete foot-rest on either side. There are now 36 blocks of these with 230 compartments for males, and 30 blocks with 147 compartments for females; further, eight blocks of pit latrines at points where height of ground permits of this type have been constructed. (40) In the refugee camps between ‘Ashar and Basrah there are 24 blocks of latrines with 144 compartments; a tin type of latrine is in use on account of the low level of the ground. Both in ‘Ashar and in the camps the contents of the latrine tins are disposed of in beehive incinerators, after mixture with dried horse litter or with bhoosa; there are 27 of these incinerators in ‘Ashar, and nine in the refugee camps. (41) In Basrah deep pit latrines covered by a slotted wooden platform are in public use; 15 blocks with 56 compartments have been provided. This type was first constructed early in 1917, and has proved satisfactory as regards comparative freedom from either attraction or breeding of flies. It has, however, been found necessary to introduce modifications to prevent the crumbling away of the sides of the pit, and a pigeon-holed brick lining is now built, together with a small brick surround on which the platform rests. Such a pit is emptied as required into closed iron filth-carts, and its contents are dumped in date gardens adjoining the town. (42) In addition to the above, eight public urinals have been erected in ‘Ashar and Basrah; the principle adopted is the use of a brick-lined pit with a concrete roof perforated to admit four funnels, with a ventilating shaft and with an emptying eye. (43) Private house cesspits and the covered cesspools for domestic suilage water constructed within each courtyard are also dealt with by this Department. These cesspools serve a useful purpose in the absence of any drainage scheme in that they keep the domestic waste water from being thrown on the roads, but it will be advantageous if gully-traps can be introduced to prevent the effluvia from rising into the houses. Earlier in the year considerable difficulty was experienced in emptying these cesspits owing to insufficient transport, but this is now satisfactory and there only remains the ever-present difficulty of keeping the cesspit gang up to strength—for the Arab does not take kindly to this work and vacancies cannot be filled by the usual labour organisations. (44) Anti-Fly Measures. —The year under review proved to be as satisfactory as 1917 from the point of view of comparative freedom from flies, although Basrah, with its greater proportion of native dwellings, was less favoured than ‘Ashar. The somewhat higher standard of attention to the ordinary details of practical sanitation, combined with additional provision of public latrines, has lessened the amount of material suitable for the deposit of eggs, while the use of sprays and traps has directly killed off many adults. It may be noted that routine inspection during the year revealed extensive breeding in stacks of dates and in heaps of damaged grain, in addition to the common breeding places dealt with in the ordinary course of scavenging. (45) Sanitary Works. —Sanitary works, in the nature of the, construction of soakage pits, latrines, incinerators or slaughter-houses, recommended by this Department, are executed by D.A.D.W. (Civil). In the first half of the year much delay was caused b} 7- difficulty in obtaining materials, but the position is now more satisfactory, and new work, of the estimated cost of Rs. 36,000, has been completed or is in progress, while repairs to existing structures have been effected at an estimated cost of Rs. 14,000/—. In all, 92 items were sanctioned during the year, and work to the value of Rs. 9,000 remains outstanding. (46) Water Supply.—Daring the whole of the year chlorinated water has been available for Basrah and the refugee camps, and in May it was found possible for the military to extend the piped supply so as to provide 15,000 gallons daily to the civil population in ‘Ashar. The necessary branch mains were laid and six stand pipes were erected at selected spots in the town and, although only an intermittent supply could be gi\ en, the installation was much appreciated; this provision was under contemplation at the time of the cholera outbreak, and its execution was hurried forward on that account. It was, however, pointed out that for a population of 19,000 this daily supply was insufficient to warrant the policing of the creeks andthe prohibition of the use of creek water, and later in the year it was found possible to augment it so that now two gallons per head per day are available—-Basrah taking 30,000 gallons, and ‘Ashar with the refugee camps 35,000 gallons. (47) Food Inspection .—Two whole-time inspectors are engaged in the work of food inspection, spending the early part of the day in the municipal slaughter houses and visiting the fish markets and food bazaars later. As regards the slaughter-house, the same method of disposal of offal and intestinal contents by incineration (with burial in the three or four cold months of the year) is in force and is satisfactory. (48) The diseases most commonly found during inspection are hydatid cysts of the liver (about 1 in 4 of both beasts and sheep affected), liver-fluke (about 1 in 10 for beasts and 1 in 20 for sheep), and cysticercus bovis (about 2 per cent, of beasts affected); less common is hydatid disease of the lungs, while tuberculosis is exceedingly rare. The following figures account for the work done at the slaughter houses :— Number Slaughtered. Number in which Parts were Condemned. ‘Ashar. Basrah (for Six Months only). ‘Ashar. Basrah (for Six Months only), Sheep - 31,900 21,712 11,379 4,660 Cattle - 3,819 670 1,843 290 Buffaloes 911 — 906 — Camels - 46 10 29 (49) Further, during their visits to the bazaars, the inspectors condemned and destroyed 156 lb. of meat, 10,395 lb. of fish, and 9,028 lb. of vegetables in ‘Ashar; and 140 lb. of meat, 323 lb. of fish, and 821 lb. of vegetables in Basrah. (50) The adoption of the regulations referred to last year regarding the sanitary requirements in butchers’ shops has much improved the appearance and cleanliness of these bazaars. The policy of collecting such trades into one area is commendable from a sanitary point of view, and a special quarter for the bakers of ‘Ashar would be advantageous.' The routine inspection of bakehouses, eating-houses and teashops has continued, and the general conditions found are satisfactory. (51) During the cholera season samples of icecream were submitted for bacterio logical examination and were found to be contaminated; the sanitary control of this industry proves difficult, inasmuch as small itinerant vendors prepare and sell the material in the bazaars and supervision is accordingly not possible. (52) The date picking and packing industry has received attention and, at the request of the Military Governor, draft sanitary regulations for its control were submitted. The regulations provided for the approval of the site and the structure of chardaghs (or packing stores) before licensing, for sanitary accommodation for the employees, for the cleanliness of workers and their methods, and for the protection of the fruit from dust and flies. (53) Housing and Town - Planning .—The Basrah Development Committee (consisting of the heads of the interested civil departments with a military repre sentative as president) held 10 further meetings until its dissolution on 27th October. During this period many questions as to future developments were discussed, but the reference of the Committee prevented the consideration of post-bellum problems. From among the Committee’s recommendations action, however, has up to date been taken in respect of— (i) Widening Club Road. (ii) Improvements at corner of Strand. (hi) Registering ideal width for all streets in ‘Ashar and Basrah. (iv) Plan for reconstruction as one wide bazaar of two narrow ‘Ashar bazaars, destroyed by fire. (v) Widening creek roadway by Baghdad Gate Bridge. (vi) Appointment of inspectors to prevent encroachments in municipal area through the erection of unauthorised huts and sarifahs. (vii) Laying out of municipal garden and nursery.264 (54) It is satisfactory to know that, with the dissolution of this Committee, the importance of guidance and control in the future development of the town and port of Basrah has not been lost sight of, and that steps will be taken to prepare schemes for water supply, drainage and refuse disposal, and to delimit industrial, residential and commercial areas. (55) Two areas (the cloth bazaar in ‘Ashar town and a sarifah encampment near the ‘Ashar butchery) suffered clearance through fire, and in both cases oppor tunity was taken to keep them as open spaces until a considered plan of reconstruction could be carried out. (56) The housing inspection register, first started last year, has continued in use as other duties of the inspectors have permitted, and 3,254 houses (figures for six months only for Basrah) have been inspected, sanitary defects have been reported, and the necessary following up has been done until improvement has been obtained. (57) Inspection of Nuisances. —Nuisances detected thus, or in the execution of the inspectors’ other work in connection with enquiries into deaths and infectious disease, are dealt with in the usual way, by verbal or written notice, followed by prosecution before the Military Governor if necessary. During the year, 393 written notices were served and 91 prosecutions were taken (including 21 for concealment of infectious disease). (58) A few offensive trades, such as the drying and salting of hides and the sorting and packing of wool, are supervised by this Department. The former trade is limited to an area beyond the Basrah slaughter-houses, and the distance from the city makes the nuisance of no importance, and for the control of both the necessary sanitary regulations have been framed and approved. (59) Carriage of Corpses to Holy Cities. —The custom of disinterring corpses and transferring the remains for burial at Najaf and Karbala results in a considerable traffic through the port from the Persian Gulf, in addition to the numbers carried from Basrah itself. The traffic was stopped in April, and was resumed in November by permission of G.O.C.-in-Chief, under certain conditions requiring inspection by this Department, and during the year passes were issued in respect of 626 bodies. (60) Sanitary Progress. —At the end of the last annual report the following four points were submitted as needing attention :— (i) The conservancy transport in ‘Ashar : an establishment has now been fixed and no difficulty is experienced in maintaining it at strength, and it is assumed that the various draught animals loaned by the Military will shortly be purchased by the municipality, as has been done in Basrah. (ii) A water supply for ‘Ashar: now obtained to the extent of about 25,000 gallons daily through standpipes. (hi) A drainage scheme: no comprehensive scheme has yet been framed, but following upon the recent rains an attempt has been made at procuring better surface drainage of the more important roads. (iv) A modern isolation hospital: although the matter has been discussed, nothing has yet been done. (61) In addition to the results reported above, the following sanitary progress during 1918 may be noted :— (i) Completion of sanitary survey of all Arab villages within the extended municipal area and approval of recommendations made. (ii) Execution of above recommendations in Akhwat Raznah, Kut-al-Hijaj, Tanumah and Qardalan. (hi) Removal of animal transport from Basrah City and provision of suitable stables outside the town. (iv) Extension of latrine and incinerator provision and erection of urinals in ‘Ashar and Basrah. (v) Institution of notification of births. (vi) Registration and inspection of mid wives. (62) Recommendations. Attention may be drawn to the following points needing attention in the near future :— (i) The erection of a modern isolation hospital with accommodation for 100 patients, and capable of temporary expansion if required. . (ii) A lock hospital for the inspection and treatment of prostitutes is required: the provision of a new isolation hospital will free a suitable site.(iii) A drainage scheme for the disposal of rain water and domestic sullage water should be taken in hand. (iv) Present methods of refuse disposal need replacing by combustion of refuse in high temperature destructors, collected in one spot outside Basrah. (v) Limitation of the number of burial grounds is desirable in order to procure better control of infectious disease. (vi) The provision of suitable Health Department offices in ‘Ashar and Basrah is required. (vii) A large extension of the present street lighting arrangements is desirable from a sanitary point of view. (63) Conclusion. —In concluding this, my third annual report on the sanitary circumstances of Basrah, I desire to record my great indebtedness to the Military Governor, the Municipal Commissioner, and the other officers of the civil admini stration for the sympathetic reception accorded to my proposals in the past and for the stimulating interest taken by them in the working of this Department; and I take this opportunity of sincerely thanking the departmental staff, without whose energy and ability no measure of sanitary progress would have been possible. N. H. Wood, Captain, R.A.M.C., Health Officer, Basrah and ‘Ashar. 2nd January 1919. Annual Report of the Port Health Officer, Basrah, 1918. (1) Obituary. —The regretted death of Capt. G. Finch, R.A.M.C. (T.F.) occurred at Bait Na‘mah Officers’ Hospital on the 8th October 1918. He had held the appointment of Port Health Officer, Basrah, since 4th October 1916, and during his two years’ tenure of the position had completed the reorganisation of the Health Department of the port on its present basis. During the influenza epidemic in September his duty exposed him to infection, and, at the end of the month, he unfortunately contracted the disease himself, and pneumonia supervened. His professional ability and administrative capacity were held in much esteem, and I desire to add a personal tribute of my admiration for them. (2) Appointment. —My appointment as Port Health Officer, Basrah, by the D.M.S., Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, is dated as from 9th October 1918. I had assisted in the work of the Department since 19th May 1918, and in June had officiated as Port Health Officer during the absence on leave of the late Capt. Finch. (3) Introductory. —In compiling this report, I shall endeavour to present a review of the complete year’s work, although my personal experience does not extend over the whole period. My information with regard to the first four months of the year has been derived from the office records. Capt. M. D. Mackenzie, R.A.M.C., has also kindly assisted by placing his personal experience of the work during this period at my disposal. I desire to acknowledge his collaboration, especially in connection with the account of anti-plague measures adopted on the H.T. “ Scottier ” during the earlier part of the year. The amount of work accomplished by the Department had been steadily increasing throughout 1917 until, during the second half of that year, a very high standard had been attained. This has been more or less maintained during 1918. The quarantine work has been greater during the year under review; but it is, I think, very satisfactory to record that the amount of ordinary sickness on ships in port has shown quite a substantial decrease on the figures for the previous year. The amount of sickness prevailing on board ships in port can, I consider, be roughly estimated by the number of vessels visited to afford medical attention in response to “ D ” flags. This calculation is open to error, but, on the whole, my impression is that, in spite of the influenza epidemic, the amount of ordinary illness has been comparatively small. . j _ . „ . ^ x1 Outbreaks of influenza on several ships necessitated, in some lew instances, the removal of most of the personnel on board to hospital. The sudden rise in the number of patients removed to hospital in October, without a proportionate increase in the number of ships visited, is explained by this fact. In the case of one store-ship as many as 20 of the crew were removed to hospital during her five days’ stay in the port.266 Owing to the mildness of the summer, no heat-stroke cases occurred. (4) Comparative Table of Visits to Ships, 1917-1918.—The following table has been prepared, and the available records of two complete years are offered for contrast:— Month. Number of Vessels Arriving. ' Vessels hqPort on 1st of the Month. Number of Visits to Ships for— Sickness. Removals to Hospital. 1918. 1917. 1918. 1917. 1918. 1917. 1918.

The average number of ships arriving daily was three. Practically all those ships entered the port in quarantine, and were examined by the boarding medical officers before pratique was given. The average number of ships in port on the first day of the month was 19. The number of visits paid to ships to afford medical attention to ordinary sick was 498. Five hundred and eighteen persons were removed to hospital. Eighty-six ships w~ere visited for inspection of coolies, and it may be added that, during the ordinary visits to ships in port, the health conditions and sanitary environ ment of the coolie gangs were closely watched and supervision exercised. Sixty-two ships were visited in order to perform vaccinations and inocidations. Forty-eight dead bodies were removed from ships for post-mortem examination and disposal. Although most of the work of the Department is undertaken in connection with Government hired transports, a moderate amount of it is concerned with the civilian passenger trade. During the year, 147 first class, 228 second class, 2,595 third class (deck) passengers, and 5,651 Persian coolies were examined before pratique was given. The civilian passenger trade from a port sanitary standpoint is discussed later. (5) Establishment. —Capt. M. D. Mackenzie, R.A.M.C. (T.C.) had been appointed in December 1917 by the A.D.M.S., Base, to assist in the work of the Department. In June 1918 he left to assume command of the 29th Sanitary Section, Ma‘qil. I assisted from 9th May until 8th October. During the early part of October 1918, Capt. R ; H. Yolland, R.A.M.C. (S.R.) assisted, but was transferred to the command of No. 27 Sanitary Section, Ashar. At the end of October, Capt. E. H. R. Harries, R.A.M.C. (T.C.) was appointed from the Base Isolation Hospital. He remains on the attached strength of the establishment. L.-Cpl. Edwards, J., R.A.M.C. (T.F.), who had been appointed from the 99th Sanitary Section m April 1917, carried out the duties of Port Sanitary Inspector. Debility following on an attack of influenza necessitated his evacuation to England in December 1918. I desire to report that this B.O.R. discharged his duties°m a most conscientious and able manner while attached to this Department Faweett, E R.A.M.C. (T.F.), from the 99th Sanitary Section, succeeded L.-Cpl. Edwards in December. Pte. Robson, P. C., R.A.M.C., has acted as clerk during the year. (6) Menial Establishment.-—During the earlier part of the year the Arab staff consisted of two guardians and three balamjis.One balamji was dispensed with at the end of the summer, and, for the present, the total Arab staff has been reduced to one guardian. This, however, is only a temporary measure, and the number will have to be increased in the near future. (7) Transport. —One motor launch, with a British R.E. driver and two lascars, is supplied by the D.I.W.T., R.E. One motor launch is placed at the disposal of the Department by the Red Cross Society. A second Red Cross launch is also now available when required. (8) Premises.- —The Port Health Office is located in a house in Pasha Lane, Khudhairi Street, ‘Ashar. The transfer of the Department to Quarantine Island has been sanctioned by the Base authorities. This change has been necessitated by the anticipated resumption of the pilgrim traffic, and will take place at an early date in 1919. (9) Equipment. —A new Clayton machine, mounted on a barge (Disinfector 1), arrived at the beginning of the year. It has been loaned temporarily to the Military Authorities for disinfection work at the Central Disinfecting Station, Base. It has been found to be satisfactory and is available at any time, if required, by this Department. A stock of drugs, vaccines, disinfecting apparatus and rat traps is kept at the office. A Field Medical Companion and dressing box with sterilisers, &amp;c., are kept on each launch. (10) Quarantine Measures. —In compliance with port rules, all ships, except H.M. ships and ambulance transports, enter the port in quarantine, whether from, infected or healthy ports or ferrying from transports at the Shatt-al-‘Arab bar. All ships arriving in quarantine, whether coming to a berth in Basrah or passing through to Nahr ‘Umar, are examined by the boarding medical officers before pratique is given. . Any infectious disease occurring on board ships at Nahr ‘Umar is dealt with by the medical authorities there, a report being telephoned to this office stating the preventive measures adopted. If it is considered necessary, the ship is visited while passing through this port on her outward journey. Bills of health are issued to out-bound ships when required. The constant direct supervision by this Department of the health conditions on board ships while in oort compensates, to a great extent, for examination of crews before departure. Routine inspection of native sailing craft is not carried out, but visits are paid to sea-going native vessels when opportunity permits. The late Port Health Officer was of the opinion that the expense entailed in the supervision of all native sailing craft bv a large staff of Arab guardians and boatmen was not justified by the results obtained. He entertained the view, as expressed in his last annual report, that there was no reason to believe that any ill consequences have resulted from not adopting more extensive measures than those in force at present. I will allude to this problem in a later part of the report. . . ^ 1 ^ x The sanitary control of the river steamer service is vested m another Department. Under peace conditions this duty will probably h%ve to be undertaken in Basrah by the Sanitary Department of the port. (11) Delay to Shipping. —Delay to shipping was reduced to a minimum; one cargo transport was detained five days in order to carry out rat destruction for plague. (12) Vaccination and Inoculation—It is known that the Department is willing to perform vaccination against small-pox, and inoculation against the enteric group of fevers and cholera, on board ships when requested. Several officers of ships have availed themselves of the opportunity during the year. (13) Coolie Labour on Board Ships.—The work of unloading ships in the port is carried out by coolie gangs, composed of Indians, Chinese and Persians from the The sanitarv conditions under which these men live have been much improved by the establishment of camps-on shore for the Chinese and Persians; while the Indians, for the most part, hve on barges on the river. The personal habits of the Persian coolies while on board ships still offer a grave menace to the health of the crews of vessels. These coolies show a very marked reluctance to reporting sick, and cases have occurred where they have died on board without the officers in charge being aware that they were ill.268 i ^ During the year two coolies died on board ships from septicsemic plague con tracted on shore. This state of affairs is very regrettable and difficult to combat. The only solution appears to lie in increased watchfulness on the part of officers of ships and stevedores and the reporting of any signs of illness among the gangs on board. This, combined with transport daily to and from the shore, would tend to obviate a repetition of the above occurrences. In the case of most ships, this is now accomplished; but transport from all ships still seems too difficult for the Port Traffic Department to carry out. (14) Infectious Disease .—The incidence of infectious disease on board ships arriving depends, to a large extent, on the existence of epidemic disease in Indian ports. The following particulars of the more important infectious diseases which occurred are gvien :— (a) Plague. —H.T* “ Scottier ” reported on arrival an unusual rat mortality. Two cases of plague were discovered among the crew. Rat destruction was carried out on board, before and after the discharge of the cargo, by fumigation with sulphur dioxide generated by burning sulphur in double iron pots. The crew and coolies unloading the cargo were inoculated with prophylactic vaccine, and quarantined on shore. The cargo was unloaded into barges, which were also fumigated. One case, disembarked ex H.T. “ Elephanta,” developed plague on shore. One coolie on H.T. “ Zira ” died of septicsemic plague, discovered post-mortem. Another coolie on H.T. “ Fooshing ” died of septicsemic plague, discovered post mortem. These three cases were probably infected on shore. The vessels having sailed, the Health Officers of the ports of destination were informed by telegram. The method of evolving sulphur dioxide by burning sulphur in iron pots has been found to be very efficient. The Clayton machine will be employed in the future, but it is satisfactory to know that a simple and efficient method is available as an alternative in the event of any breakdown in the complicated mechanical means adopted in the Clayton apparatus. (b) Cholera .—Eight cases of true cholera occurred on eight vessels in the port. Four cases occurred on ocean-going ships and four on port barges. Several other cases of gastro-enteritis clinically resembling cholera, but unconfirmed bacteriologically, also occurred. The definite cases of cholera occurred during an epidemic on shore, but the sporadic nature of the outbreak in the port makes an answer as to the source of infection rather difficult. Impure river water is drunk freely by the coolies unloading ships, in spite of the provision of sterilised water in tanks. Probably a massive infection of some portion of river water drunk determines the development of the disease. On the other hand, food sold by Arab women on the river is by no means above suspicion. Quarantine - of contacts on board was employed in some of these cases. Quarters and latrines were thoroughly disinfected, and the water on board was chlorinated. In some cases anti-cholera inoculation was done. These measures were found to be successful, and further cases did not occur. No apparent delay was occasioned to the traffic of the port. (c) Smallpox. —Twenty-one ships arrived with cases of smallpox on board. One ship had two cases, and 20 ships a single case each. In the case of four other ships, notifications were received that smallpox cases had been disembarked at ports of call in the Persian Gulf; these were treated as suspected vessels. Also, in the case of four other ships, notifications were received that smallpox had developed among troops disembarked. Two of these were ambulance transports. Preventive measures were carried out in each instance by vaccination of all contacts where necessary, and with disinfection of quarters and bedding. Area Sanitary Officers were notified through the Area Commandants, for surveillance or observation of contacts on shore. Fresh cases did not arise. In one or two instances the ship had sailed, and the Health Officers of the ports of destination were informed by telegram. (d) Cerebrospinal Fever .—Thirteen cases of cerebro-spinal fever occurred on ships arriving. One store-ship had two cases, and 11 other ships had one case each.In the case of three other ships, notifications of the development of the disease (one case each) among details disembarked were received. Disinfection of quarters and bedding was done, and notifications were sent to Sanitary Officers of areas. The sporadic nature of the disease is generally remarked, so that the develop ment of two cases among the crew of the small store-ship ‘is of epidemological interest. (e) Typhus Fever. —Two cases occurred within a few days of each other in May among the Persian coolies working ships at Ma‘qil. The gangs were cleansed at the Central Disinfecting Station, and no fresh cases occurred. The crews of the ships were inspected for the presence of vermin, and dealt with accordingly. (f) Diphtheria. —Five cases of diphtheria occurred on five ships; one case on each. (g) Chickenpox and Measles. —Eleven cases of chickenpox occurred on nine ships; one ship having three cases and eight ships a single case each. Eleven cases of measles occurred on six ships; one had five cases, one had two, and four had each a single case. (h) Leprosy. —One case of leprosy ansesthetica was removed to hospital from H.T. “ Fooshing.” The crew were examined and the quarters disinfected. (i) Enteric Group Fevers. —Six ships had one case each, notified after removal to hospital. (j) Beri-beri. —No extensive outbreak of beri-beri occurred on any ship in this port. Four ships were found to be slightly affected, and five cases of ship’s beri-beri were removed from one transport. Thorough disinfection of quarters and revision of dietary were the preventive measures taken, where necessary. (k) Relapsing Fever. —Fifteen notifications of relapsing fever among troops disembarked were received. (l) Influenza. —The spread of pandemic influenza, originating in Spain, affected this port during the autumn months. Figures are not available, but it may be said that in some cases more than half of the crews of vessels in the port had to be removed to hospital. Masters of ships were advised to keep their crews on board ships while in this and other ports. Disinfection of quarters was done when necessary, and gargling with mild antiseptics was advised. The epidemic subsided towards the end of October. Notifications, on the arrival of transports with a large number of cases on board, were sent to Area Sanitary Officers. (m) Yellow Fever and Scarlet Fever. —No cases. (15) Medical Attention.—Most of the Government ships in port have no medical officer on board, and medical attention is supplied by this Department. This is in addition to the quarantine duties undertaken at other ports. A special round of the ships in the river is paid every morning to treat ordinary sickness and, if necessary, to remove patients to hospital. A very large number of non-infectious sick have been treated on board and the sanitary condition of the ships is supervised, as well as observation of the health conditions of the coolies on board being undertaken. It was estimated by the late Port Health Officer that, at any one time, the officers of the Department were in medical charge of between 2,000-3,000 persons. (16) Heat Stroke. —The arrangements made for treatment of heat-stroke cases were, fortunately, not required. If cases had occurred, it was arranged that the “ D.E.” flags were to be hoisted on board, and the Embarkation Medical Officer notified by telephone. The A.D.M.S., Base, had prepared an arrangement by which a medical officer from No. 3 B.G.H. was to visit the ship and remove the case, ice being supplied on his launch. (17) The Future Port Sanitary Service of Basrah.—The approach of peace conditions and the anticipated resumption of the Shi ah pilgrim traffic from overseas, afford an opportunity for the discussion in this report of the future organisation of the sanitary defences of Southern Mesopotamia. The international aspect of the question will in the future demand even more consideration than it did in the past. The rate of human travel from Mesopotamia to Europe will be greatlv hastened within a few years, and it is almost an axiom to270 state that cholera (to take a typical example of diseases which are feared in Europe) spreads at the same rate. The responsibility for the provision of a defensive sanitary organisation in Basrah before the war was assumed under signature of the International Sanitary Conventions of 1903 and 1912 by the Turkish Government. The actual duty of framing regulations in accordance with these Conventions, and of establishing sanitary stations, was delegated to the Constantinople Superior Board of Health. A quarantine station was established near Basrah, and existed for some years. In 1912 this station was inspected by a Commission and was found to require reorganisation. Plans were drawn up, but the outbreak of war cancelled all arrangements. After the British occupation, the buildings were handed over to the military as the nucleus of an Isolation Hospital at the Base. This is the position at present. During the war the principle of surveillance has been necessarily adopted in dealing with troops. This has been quite satisfactory. The Regulations of the International Sanitary Convention of 1912 were signed by the British delegates, with the stipulation that all the Colonies, Possessions and Protectorates of the British Government were to be free to choose for themselves whether they decided to be governed by the Convention’s articles or not, notice being given to the French Government of the terms of their intentions in regard to the matter. As soon as a Civil Government for Mesopotamia is established, it will be necessary for it to decide whether a Port Sanitary Service is to be instituted in Basrah. If it is decided that this is requisite, the next duty will be to have regulations formulated for its administration. These regulations may be in con formity with the provisions of the International Sanitary Conventions, in which case a notification to this effect would be sent to the Foreign Ministry of the French Republic. It should be understood that the details for a sanitary service in Basrah have not been framed in the International Sanitary Convention Regulations, but certain articles therein are intended as a general guide for the drawing up of special regulations for this port. I quote the most important article, part 2, sect. 6, art. 83, Sanitary Control of the Persian Gulf :— “ The sanitary regulations prescribed in the articles of this Convention shall be applied to ships entering the Persian Gulf by the Sanitary Authorities of the ports of arrival. These regulations, in so far as they relate to the classification of ships and the measures to be undergone in the Persian Gulf, are subject to the three following modifications :— 1. Observation, for the same period, shall always be substituted for surveillance of passengers and crew. 2. Healthy ships cannot be granted free pratique unless they have completed five full days since leaving the last infected port at which they have touched. 3. In the case of suspected ships, the period of five days’ observation of passengers and crew shall be reckoned from the time at which there ceased to be a case of plague or of cholera on board.” In order to carry out without delay to shipping the provisions of this article, a quarantine station on shore is necessary. In the case of healthy ordinary ships, which have been five days out from an infected port, pratique should be granted immediately. In the case of infected ships, i.e., ships having a case of plague or of cholera on board, quarantine on shore is necessary for a period of five days. In the case of suspected ships, quarantine on shore may be necessary in order to complete the required period of observation. .x 1 already stated, in my Memo. No. 500 Port, dated 9th December 1918, to the A.D.M.b., Base, with a copy to the M.G. and P.O., Basrah, that in my opinion, this quarantine station will be necessary if the health of the military and civil population of the country is to be safeguarded in the event of a resumption of the pilgrim tramc. ^ In tins letter I outlined the requirements for an observation establishment on Quarantme Island, near Basrah, stipulating for huts for the accommodation of 1,000 persons, with all sanitary arrangements, ablution places, disinfectors, &amp;c.I foresee that the treatment accorded to all passengers on arrival will not differ much from that undertaken on the arrival at Kamaran of pilgrim ships destined for the Hijaz. The future Civil Health Service of the City of Basrah may permit of some mitigation of the severity of the quarantine measures which may be adopted, especially in the case of first and second class passengers on ordinary infected ships arriving. It may be found possible to substitute surveillance for observation. In the case of ordinary deck passengers and of pilgrims, I do not see that the system of surveillance adopted in Western ports can be applied with any hope of success. This is especially true in the case of the latter class. If a distinction is to be made between ordinary and pilgrim ships in the future, special regulations will have to be framed with regard to them. In the Hijaz the position is very much simpler than it is in these regions. Most of the ships sail from Indian ports as pilgrim ships, but in the Persian Gulf ports it is evident that, owing to the class of passengers who ordinarily travel for business reasons or for labour purposes being more or less recruited from among the same social grade as the pilgrim class, it is somewhat easy for the latter to mingle with the former and travel on ordinary ships as ordinary passengers. The possibility of sea-going native craft carrying pilgrims to the Shatt-al-Arab from Persian ports is also a problem to be entertained. In the river it is possible for them to transfer to balams, by which means examination may be avoided. All these considerations incline me to submit the following proposals :— (i) That a civil port sanitary authority be constituted in Basrah on a peace-time basis. (ii) That regulations be framed in detail for the administration of the Depart ment in conformity with the International Sanitary Convention of 1912, especially articles 21 to 35 inclusive, 54, and 83 to 126 inclusive. (iii) That regulations for the sanitary control of river steamers and native sailing craft be framed, especially with regard to sea-going native craft entering the river from ports in the Persian Gulf. (iv) That a permanent quarantine station with accommodation for 1,000 persons, with all sanitary requirements, disinfectors, &amp;c., be erected. (v) That a pure water supply be provided in the port for the use of shipping. Rules for the purpose of facilitating the operations of the (Indian) Pilgrim Ships Act (XIV. of 1895), as amended by Article 3 of King’s Regulations, No. 1, dated 16th July 1912, have been made by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Pars, Khuzistan, &amp;c., and published for general information. These are intended to apply to pilgrims from the Persian Gulf destined for the Hijaz, and may be adopted as operative with regard to this port, if approved by the Civil Government of Mesopotamia. I submit the above proposals for your consideration. The actual details for the reorganisation of the port Sanitary Department on a peace-time basis depend on the decisions which may be made by the Civil Government of Mesopotamia with regard to the wider aspects of the question. These I have attempted to outline within the scope of this report. (18) Acknowledgements .—The various departments connected with the admini stration of the port, viz., the Port and Sea Transport Directorates, including the Director of Port Traffic, the Port Officer, the Director of Sea Transport, and their officers, have fully co-operated with the Officers of the Port Health Department during the year. I' especially desire to acknowledge the assistance of the Harbour Masters in facilitating the work of the Boarding Medical Officers in the performance of their examining duties on the river. J. Mackenzie, Captain, R.A.M.C. (S.R.), Port Health Officer, Basrah. {Subsidiary Report.) (19) Mahaulah Wharf .—The sanitation of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co.’s camp for Persian labour at Mahaulah Wharf has been undertaken by this Department during the year. It is satisfactory to state that good progress has been made. Huts have been erected, latrines built, and a pure water supply provided.272 A threatened outbreak of smallpox was checked by vaccination. Two cases occurred in the camp area. Four cases of smallpox were removed from the surrounding Arab villages, and preventive measures taken. . (2^ Harbour Masters, Sarraji .^—Medical attention and superintendence of the sanitation of this Department have been carried out. One case of smallpox occurred, but further spread was prevented by the usual measures. J. Mackenzie, Captain, R.A.M.C. (S.R.), Port Health Officer, Basrah. 8b. Medical.— The remaining paragraphs of this chapter are contributed by Capt. D. F. Borrie, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., O.B.E., Civil Surgeon, Basrah:— Civil Hospital .—The hospital at the beginning of this year had grown till it contained 150 beds. It has not since increased in size, and efforts have been con centrated this year on improving and rendering it more efficient; these efforts have been much hampered by the inability of the Civil Works Department to complete estimates sanctioned early in the year. However, in spite of all difficulties, a real advance has been made, more particularly in the training of people of this country tor work in the Hospital and in attention to the actual nursing of patients. Two thousand three hundred and eighty-three patients were treated in all departments. Ihese are dealt with under the separate departments. Medical Wards. 1,307 patients have been treated in this Department during the past 12 months. These are classified as follows :— Admission. Cured. Relieved. Deaths. Transfers. 1,307 1,070 37 119 47 The death-rate is large owing to the outbreak of influenza and pneumonia, in which very many cases were admitted. 9. Police : (l) Introductory. —The following paragraphs of this chapter an from the reports of the Deputy-Commissioner of Police and of the Criminal Investi- gation Department.

The Janub continues to be troublesome with offences of the more violent kind. So far as figures are a guide, it is at least a matter for partial satisfaction that, with a considerably larger number of cases to investigate, the police managed to detect, send for trial, and get convicted appreciably more cases than they did last year. On the other hand, the amount of property stolen during the year has trebled, while recoveries have only risen about 64 per cent. The proportion of convictions to cases sent for trial is still phenomenally large, as are convictions to investigations; but it is necessary to look beyond statistics when judging police work, and I am of opinion that we have not yet got very much reason for satisfaction. A noticeable feature is the absence of action under the preventive sections. The fact is, so little is at present known of the true history of the criminal element, and so little help is to be obtained from Mukhtars and public, that the police have not been in a position to produce evidence of bad livelihood. I have started the collection of information about the history and antecedents of all bad characters, and hope to ensure that more is done in the way of controlling known depredators in the future. Formerly it appears that very little interest was taken in a convict once he had completed liis sentence. This is very largely due to the low standard of training of the rank and hie, who show little keenness or ability towards bringing in useful information. In the near future a further problem will be set to the police in the return to their homes of many of the worst characters of Turkish times. It is, however, a point of some interest that many of the old badmashes who were not deported have now settled down as law-abiding citizens, and are ever ready to assist the police with information. * I will now proceed to note briefly on the different classes of crime. (2) Class I. : Offences against the State, the.—There was one case of rioting, in which there is strong suspicion that homicide was committed; the evidence from post-mortem examination, however, showed death due to natural causes. The cause of the riot was a dispute as to the possession of a dancing boy. This case was important also for the reason that one Fath, Mukhtar of the Shatt, who worked a kind of unofficial balam patrol and was nominally supposed to help the police in running down crime on the river, was the principal accused. He had long been suspected of using his position for himself committing crime on the river, and his conviction and sentencing to a year’s imprisonment were satisfactory. There was also a somewhat serious riot between watchmen on the B.I. Wharf at Mahaulah and Richardson and Crudda’s workmen. Also another at ‘Abadan between Persian coolies and men of a Burmese Porter Corps. There was one bad escape from custody: a prisoner condemned to death got out of the Basrah Jail under the eyes of the sentries; one of the latter, a jail warder, was armed with smooth bore Martini, but did not use it; the other, a police constable, had only a baton and was engaged in rousing his relief. Both were convicted and sentenced, the warder to two years, the policeman to four. In another case Hidayat, the ex-Sub-Inspector, and a companion, escaped from the jail and were caught at some personal risk by two police constables; the convicts had provided themselves in jail with disguise, and a weapon in the shape of a large pair of tailor’s scissors. Section 240/24 : Coining. —There has been a fairly constant, though from such information as has reached the police not a large, influx of counterfeit coin. I he common opinion is that it comes from Persia, and certainly a run of cases seemed to coincide with the sojourn, in the vicinity of Basrah, of Persian kaulis (gipsies). Police action has met with indifferent success, but adequate evidence is difficult to obtain; as a rule the “ utterer ” has been found to be himself a dupe who did not know' he was passing bad coin. The workmanship is very crude in all cases that have come under my observation, the coin being moulded, not struck. (3) Class II. : Serious Offences against the Person.—There is a small rise in this class of offences, particularly in the most serious offences, viz., murder, culpable homicide, and attempted murder, which show 13 true cases as against five in 1917. On the other hand no cases of 1917 were detected, whereas in 1918 two murders,274 a culpable homicide and three attempted murders were convicted. One case of culpable homicide was dealt with as a tribal case by the Assistant Political Officer and convicted. The Police had practically laid their hands on the offender, and the case should count as detected. For one case that ended in conviction and the death sentence, the chief credit is due to a head constable and his men, who took prompt action and ran the accused to earth on a hot scent. The murderer was a previous convict who did not hesitate to stab when disturbed in a theft. This occurred in ‘Ashar (Mahallat-al-Sai). Taking the class as a whole, success has been very fair, with nearly 50 per cent, of convictions to case investigated. At the same time, there can be no blinking the fact that there have been one or two deliberate murders in which no sort of clue was obtained. In one at Abul Khasib, a man was shot through the head as he lay asleep in his garden; no motive, even, has come to light in this case. In another, two Persian coolies were shot late in the evening near Barradhiyah village as they were returning from ‘Ashar to Sarraji. I suggested in this case that disci plinary action should be taken against the neighbouring villages, as the murder was committed on a fairly well frequented road, close to two large villages, well inside the Military Governor’s area. The motive in this case was possibly robbery, but this is not certain. (4) Class III. : Serious Offences against the Person and Property, &lt;Tc.—There has been a very considerable increase of crime in this class. Robberies and dacoities have gone up from five in 1917 to 15 in 1918; house-breaking from 37 to 91. Stolen property for the same two sub-heads was Rs. 34,104/- and Rs. 65,161/- in 1918 as against Rs. 8,051/- and Rs. 12,766/- in 1917. Police action has been no more unsuccessful, so far as the percentage of cases brought to trial goes, than in 1918; both sets of figures are, however, anything but good. I have mentioned briefly above some of the factors now operating which may be expected to send up crime. There are other special factors in the case of serious offences against property. The ease with which stolen property can be disposed of is one. There seems to be little sense of responsibility among the local gold smiths in this matter, and they will have to be educated by a series of prosecutions and convictions. And here I would beg for a liberal interpretation of the law as regards presumption of guilty knowledge on the part of the person in whose possession stolen property is found. I have recently impressed on all concerned the prime importance of pressing home every case of receiving, and am glad to say that these instructions are bearing fruit. Apart from regular receivers, about whom it must be admitted w^e know very little, the public generally seem quite leady to buy articles of \alue from any one offering them for sale in the street; heie again much can be done by the Police by running in all unlicensed hawkers, and this is receiving attention. It is one of the commonest practices this selling goods of all desciiptions in the street, and large hauls have been made of persons infringing the regulations in this way. 1 ha ve mentioned overcrowding and the advent of undesirable outsiders as factors affecting crime. The confused collection of huts and shelters known as Mahallat-al-Sai, just outside Ashar town, as well as the more orderly refugees’ quarters, harbour a large population of disreputable characters. The balamji class appears to be a specially criminal one, and a gang of these who had their head quarters at Mahallat-al-Sai has been marked down who undoubtedlv were in the habit of committing house-breakings in Basrah and removing the property, generally piece goods by the ‘Ashar creek. The Military Governor has since, at my request, issued orders regulating the movement of goods on the creek by night and special I ohce watch and ward measures have been taken. Action under the preventive sections is intended against the members of this gang, but most of them Muhammarah is still supposed to be the receiving depot for a great deal of stolen pioperty, as well as the asylum of absconding offenders; other resorts of these gentry are said to be Hawizah and Failiyah. The ease with which absconders can get away into foreign and tribal territory and the marshes and leave no trace of their whereabouts is one of the most baffling factors with which the Police have to contend. I am now making a special point descSelr^t CnmmalS Photographed: this will be a useful addition to descuptive rolls that are now circulated to all likely agencies. Political Officers in charge of districts are notified as well as Police stations.The proper surveillance of ex-convicts who are likely to return to crime is one of the most important safeguards that the Police have it in their power to apply. So far the system whereby the Police get intimation from the jail authorities of the impending release of convicts is not being worked properly, but I hope to enlist the co-operation of the Superintendent to this end. The same may be said about arrangements for transferring convicts, before release, to the jail at their old residence, so that the Police who know them may at once get in touch with them. This is a system which it might perhaps be worth while to extend to the Police agency that is worked by Political Officers of districts, more especially for the control of town badmashes. The question of responsibility of Mukhtars in the matter of assisting the Police with information is an important one. The Mukhtars of Basrah town are inclined to disclaim responsibility for knowing what is going on and reporting to the Police, on the score that they have no naturs. With one or two notable exceptions, the Mukhtars are of negligible value from a Police point of view. Personally, I am of opinion that the natur system is a necessary one at the present stage of development, and that its abolition is a mistake. Crime in the Janub requires special notice. There have been a number of cases of a serious nature, including murder, and dacoity with and without murder. This tract is notorious from Turkish times; it is close to Muhammerah territory, and so easily accessible to gangs from there. More than one organised dacoity, in which murder was done, was committed in this circle during the year, and these cases remained untraced. Disciplinary action against the village was, I believe, taken by the Political Officer in one case. A large proportion of the cases of violent crime that took place during the year are reported from this (Abul Khasib) Police Station, and the portion of the Port Police Station area on the opposite bank; but, except for a river dacoity in November, these were confined to the earlier part of the year. It is possible that, without knowing it, we may in other cases have laid our hands on some of the ringleaders. In this connection a valuable capture was made at Nahr ‘Umar by the C.LD. in the shape of three men armed with revolvers and daggers, two of whom turned out to be absconders in old dacoity cases. All three men were tried by a Military Commission and sentenced to five years’ rigorous imprisonment each; evidence of general bad repute was admitted. One of these men will be run in in the original dacoity case. There were two cases of dacoity on booms lying in the river, and also a number of cases of dacoity and aggravated house-breaking on the islands and mainland on the left bank, opposite and up and down stream of Bait Na‘mah Hospital. There is, undoubtedly, still a dangerous criminal population floating about in these parts. The first step towards controlling this element must be more intimate relations between the local Police and the Mukhtars and villagers, coupled with a rigid insistance on the responsibility of the Mukhtars for reporting all matters affecting crime direct to the Inspector of Police. Up to date there has been, I am afraid, considerable waste of effort, owing to the Police and the Revenue authorities conducting separate investigations, instead of collaborating, and the village authorities have not realised their responsibility to the Police. As last year, no special measures were taken during the date-packing season. Only one serious dacoity on a date boom took place; this remains untraced. Little can be done to deal with this sort of crime till the Police are provided with better means of communication and patrolling than the tortoise-like helium, and have more posts up and down the river. A serious case of house trespass by night with assault was committed early in July in the Sisters’ Quarters of 40 British General Hospital at Makinah. The motive was undoubtedly robbery, but two sisters were seriously injured with blows on the head. The shattered remains of a glass bottle were found on the pillow of one of them. Only Rs. lo/— in notes was stolen. ^No clue 01 trace was ever found. The Sisters’ Quarters w r ere in the most exposed part of a very exposed area. Since the occurrence a more adequate guard and a barbed wore fence ha\e been provided. Suspicion turned naturally to members of Labour and loiter Corps, especially those in the Labour Depot just opposite, but all efforts failed to trace the crime. The swarm of jail-recruited personnel that is scattered all over the Military Governor’s area is another of the anomalous factors in the situation as regards crime. It is not so much the regular Jail Corps that are a danger, since the personnel of these are well known to be criminals and their officers have them under proper control. But scattered through every kind of unit at the base are convict sweepers, u 2276 convict dhobis, convict bullock drivers, convict syces, &amp;c. It is rarely that their commanding officers have been given any information as to their pievious history, and the result is that there is a varied assortment of the choicest blackguards of the Indian jails, freed from practical^ all surveillance, about whom the Police know nothing until they happen to land one for crime committed here. Men with as many as 10 previous convictions have been caught. There seems to be no real remedy for this state of affairs. The chief obstacle to any purely local registration and surveillance by the Civil Police (apart from probable objections by commanding officers) is that the crime records of convicts other than those belonging to Disci plinary Corps do not appear to be available in this country. I should add that commanding officers are, as a rule, ready enough to hand over their men for civil trial, and we have put away one at least for a term of seven years and others for shorter periods. (5) Class IV. : Minor Offences against the Person. —There are no cases of offences coming under this head. (6) Class V. : Minor Offences against Property. —This class includes, as the commonest offences, theft of all kinds, cheating, receiving stolen property, and criminal breach of trust. There is, again, an increase for the class as a whole amounting to 75 per cent, over last year. In the case of theft of the commonest kinds, “ receiving,” and cheating, stolen property has risen to 200 per cent. (Rs. 30,000/- to Rs. 90,000/-) and the percentage of recoveries has fallen from 39 per cent, to 26 per cent. In the case of the two last-named classes, offences under which are double last year’s figures, much may fairly be attributed to increased Police activity. Action as regards these last two classes has also been commendably successful, nearly 80 per cent, of cases investigated having ended in conviction. The commoner offences of theft have not been so successfully dealt with. I would, however, repeat here, that there are many factors militating against good statistical results, not forgetting the probability of better registration, and would urge that not too much reliance be placed on the figures (themselves by no means absolutely reliable) in judging Police action. A class of theft which has occupied a considerable place in the work of the year is that of pilfering on the river, particularly from Government store ships, barges, and mahailahs. In the early part of the year I was asked by the I.G.C. to establish the river patrol of balams to watch for this. There is no doubt that looting does go on from mahailahs and barges which, after loading from ocean-going ships, fre quently lie up in the stream for some time waiting to discharge at the wharves. The booty is easily got away in balams to the left bank and concealed in villages among the date groves. The patrol put on, of four balams, did a certain amount of useful work, but could not be expected to be a really efficient blockade, con sidering the great extent of the port area. Even in its most restricted sense this includes the stretch of river from Qurmat ‘Ali to Sarraji Creek, a distance of nearly 8 miles. Later in the year an officer on special duty from England reviewed the arrangements for safeguarding Government stores in the port, and I was again asked for proposals. These when completed provided for six launches for a motor-boat patrol and an increased staff of 14 British other ranks and 40 Arab rank and file and the establishment of a subsidiary river police station at Ma‘qil. The proposals for launches were negatived by G.H.Q. and modified proposals for an increased bellam patrol are now before the I.G.C. The river Police will, I apprehend, be an increasingly important agency as time goes on. The river and creeks are so essentially the ordinary means of transit of goods, and the methods of trade in Basrah and the Sanjaq generally, and of handling merchandise, lend themselves so readily to every kind of pilfering, theft and swindling, that there is a very large field open for work in this direction, and expansion must certainly take place quite apart from Military requirements. Here again the co operation of Mukhtars must be obtained, and this part of the Sanjaq, particularly the left bank, must be brought under Police control. One of the commonest of the lesser forms of crime in the towns is pickpocketting. Boys who take to this seem quickly to become incorrigible; certainly the mild sentences of caning usually inflicted are no deterrant whatever. I approached the Military Governor on the subject of the provision of some sort of special accom modation in the jail for juvenile offenders, but this was not considered feasible. It is a pity that so much potential criminality cannot be nipped in the bud.There have been, on and off throughout the year, a number of thefts from officers’ quarters and billets. Most of these maj^ probably be put down to the criminal element among Indian followers, to which I have referred earlier in this Report. Owing to the circumstances already described, the Police are under a heavy handicap in checking and detecting crime of this sort. (7) Class VI .—This class includes all petty offences and offences against Army Commander’s proclamations, dealt with summarily. No figures are given, as this was not done last year. There is, however, one class of offence coming under this head which is of importance, viz., smuggling of opium and other drugs. Another is the offence of being found in possession of Government property. The expansion of the river Police should assist largely in checking these forms of crime. (8) General Development of the Force .—The strength of the force underwent modification twice during the year. A new sanctioned establishment reducing the number of all ranks from 731 to 535 was introduced in March and again in September a reduction was made from 535 to 440. At the time of the second reduction ration allowance of Rs. 15/- per month was introduced and also three allowances of Rs. 5/- each for (1) proficiency, (2) extra proficiency, and (3) long service (three years). With an initial rate of pay of Rs. 30/- a constable who is literate and has three years’ service can now draw as much as Rs. 60/- per month. It was hoped that this increase of pay would bring in recruits, but it has not done so. It may be that all available material has already been absorbed by the Labour Directorate, and in putting in proposals recently for the river patrol I asked the I.G.C. to assist me with 150 Arabs from this source. In all probability, when the demand for labour eases off, recruits may be glad to come in; at present they will not. I could get Persians, but do not wish to enlist any more of these, as there is too large a proportion of them in the force already. The men already in the force seem on the whole contented. There have been only 19 desertions this year, as against 115 last. If once a good flow of recruiting could be started and the excessively long hours of duty cut down, I believe the force would increase in popularity. My intention is to develope the Military side of the men’s training, give them more frequent changes of duty and less exacting tedious stretches of point duty. Nothing can, however, be done as long as the present shortage of men continues, and I am anxiously awaiting the result of my application to the I.G.C. for help in this direction. Training .—The sanctioned strength of British instructors is now 11, and these have proved useful in smartening the men up and keeping them up to the mark on their duties. They have also had to be employed to supervise Police guards put on store ships to stop pilfering and on the river patrols. Training of the Head quarters Reserve has suffered much from the absence for long periods (as much as six weeks at a time) of escorts sent to Bombay. The Headquarter Police have charge of two manual fire-engines, and have proved useful in dealing with minor outbreaks of fire. Instruction of constables in the rudiments of law and procedure is given, and I am negotiating for a schoolmaster to teach recruits their letters. There are not enough Arab drill instructors; though I have one good Egyptian; also a good Egyptian armourer, who has been put through a course with the Ordnance Depart ment, and now carries out all ordinary repairs to arms. Training of the higher ranks has been chiefly in the hard school of practical work, though classes in law have been held for native officers, and will be resumed as soon as the Public Prosecutor returns from leave. Improvement in procedure is slow, very largely from the absence of law books and manuals in the vernacular. I have just bought copies of the Central Provinces Police Manual for all Police stations and offices, and this will simplify very much the issue of instructions as it will only be necessary to quote the manual and indicate any required modifications. Any up-to-date Police manual would have served the purpose. I chose that of my owii Province, because any single one must have been strange to the majority of the users, and the one with which I was familiar would be the easiest for me to issue instructions from. In the absence of a manual, long circular orders on procedure have been necessary, involving great waste of time. There is still, however, no Arabic text-book, and this means that the majority of the Police station investigating and clerical staff can only learn by repeated mistake. Much of the routine work of a Police station is simple enough to be done by a well-trained writer head constable, but accuracy is important; the station house officers themselves have not the time to278 check the work minutely and the present Police station clerks are many of them not intimately conversant with Police procedure and have not a high degree of education. Thus diaries, &amp;c., are inaccurately written up and magistrates complain, particularly those who are accustomed to administer the Criminal Procedure Code in India. I have recently promoted two senior head constables to the rank of clerk sub-inspector, and hope in time to eliminate the local babu type from Police stations. Four non-gazetted officers have been trained and have qualified as finger-print proficients, and four others have been trained in the method of taking impressions. (9) Recruitment of Local Inhabitants as Native Officers. —There are now 10 locally born Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors, five of these being probationers under training. All are Mohammedans except two, who are Armenian and Jew respect ively. Half of these local men are quite untrained, having only very recently joined. (10) Relations between the Police and the Public. —I am told at somewhat frequent intervals that the Police are very unpopular with the people, but there have been very few actual complaints of acts of oppression or high handedness, and this makes it difficult for me to gauge the situation. The people who complained, as far as I can make out, are the well-to-do merchant class; some of these, I suspect, look for preferential treatment in matters like traffic control, which they probably got in Turkish times; all probably forget the centuries of bad tradition behind all subordinate Government officials in this country, and expect too much improve ment in a short time. Moreover, the people in general use the word “ Police 55 for every kind of official of the lower ranks, jail warders, labour Police, fire brigade— anything, in fact, in uniform. I have had several concrete instances of complaints against the Police, turning out to refer to men of entirely other departments. The fact remains that the number of charges of rough treatment, oppression, or extortion is practically nil. I should be the first to take up and punish severely any such cases that were brought before me, and all ranks have been strictly warned on the subject. (11) Health of the Force. —There was a great deal of sickness in the latter part of the hot weather, particularly among the office clerks and the influenza epidemic took its toll. In this connection I may remark that money spent on fans and comfortable quarters is never wasted in a climate so trying as that of Basrah. (12) Buildings. —New Police lines are badly needed, and I intend to apply for the present Indian Base Depot (old Turkish barracks) at Qazarah to be ear marked for future Police lines when vacated by the Military. Houses for station house officers are also badly needed; the Police station is much too public a place for persons to bring information to. A good hutment has been provided for the Ma‘qil Police by the area Commandant. 10. Shabanahs : (1) Zubair. — The Assistant Political Officer, Zubair, reports as follows :— ,&lt; . &gt; It was decided in March to form a local Shabanah force for the policing of the B.N. Railways. The pa^ decided upon was : Chaush, Rs. 50/- ; Onbashi, Rs. 40/-; Nafar, Rs. 30/—. One hundred and forty-seven was thv number fixed and the men were icciuited, half from Zubair and the other half from Dhafir tribes. They were armed and equipped with the *303 long Lee-Knfield, Mark I., rifle, 50 rounds of ammunition, bandoliers, and water-bottles, but had no uniform. The posts from Zubair station to Ghabashiyah, with the exception of SlnFaibah station, were taken o\er fiom the Military on the 11th May, and Yadillah to Muraijib, excluding Luqait and Tall-al-Lahm, on the 20th May. Shaikh Ibrahim had warned me that the men would not submit to being drilled, so I contented myself with teaching them to cairy their arms and salute. Their duties were to guard the railway personnel and property , and for this purpose they were required to provide patrols of two men to accompany coolie gangs. The Zubair group, which occupies the posts from here to Ghabashiyah, have done their work well, and their conduct has been almost exemplary. ^FP^Afir, who occupy the remaining posts, demurred at accompanying coolie gangs. ns was brought to my notice by report of an alleged case of removing bolts from the line by desert Beduin. There were no witnesses to support the story of the keyman, and as the question of escorting coolies w as being pressed at th same time it was considered to have been made up by them. The Shabanah were made to provide patrols for the coolies and there was no further complaint on thatscore. Later on, some little damage was done to the telegraph poles in the Dhafir area. The Shammar near by were fined and the Dhafir Shabanah warned that they too would, in future, be punished if they did not discover the offenders. Then the nuisance stopped. It is considered that the Dhafir themselves did it to injure the Shammar. Their conduct on the whole has not been as good as that of the Zubair men. “ The force was increased to 177 in July in order to take over the guarding of Jabal Sanam Railway. This was done on the 1st August. The men were recruited from Zubair and have given every satisfaction. “ The Arab Superintendent was engaged in June, and has been found very useful in connection with rations and equipment. Two B.O.R. instructors were engaged in June, making now a total of three; one of whom is employed as acting Quarter master Sergeant in charge of the office and stores ; one is in charge of the Zubair Company, now including 23 men at Shu‘aibah station, which was taken over on the 29th September; and a third is in charge of the Dhafir Company, now increased by 40 to include Luqait and Tall-al-Lahm, taken over on the 27th and 28th September, respectively. The men are now all provided with uniform, consisting of a khaki daqlas of native cut, c aqal, kafiyah, and native sandals. They have been informally 5 taught a certain amount of drill and cleanliness by their B.O.R. instructors, and present a good appearance. There has been no difficulty in obtaining recruits since the men were posted, and we have a reserve of 73 men that were engaged for blockade work and then discharged. “ (2) Basrah .—The Basrah Sanjaq Shabanah are isolated groups of watchmen at the Local Resources Wharf at Fijjat-al-Arab, at Bait Na‘mah Hospital, at Quliyan Station, and at Nahr ‘Umr, and do not form an organised body. “ 11. Labour : Labour .—Military demands on Arab labour have been insistent and exacting throughout the year and the strictest measures have been necessary in order to keep the supply approximate to the demand. This is always difficult during the date season, and it was quite impossible during the ravages of influenza. It is a task which must be distasteful to a Political Officer, since inclination and duty are so much at variance. However fully he may realise the necessity of providing labour for the needs of the Army, his sympathies are bound to be with the Mallaks and their fellahs who suffer—the only class in this country that has not made profit from the war. It is to be hoped that one of the earliest signs of the dawn of peace may be the abolition of this impressment; so long as it remains one cannot expect the rural population to appreciate the sincerity of our protesta tions of goodwill, notwithstanding the removal of restrictions on trade and travel which marked the morrow of the Armistice. The total number of coolies demanded for labour corps is 2,239, and this number is gradually being reached again after the lapse which took place during the epidemic. Besides this, some 8,000 men are obtained from the municipal area as casual labourers; this work is not so irksome as that of the labour corps, in which men remain for a fortnight or a month at a time, though the rates paid by Government cannot compare with those offered by merchants in the bazaar. The Assistant Political Officer has also to find labour for detached work at Nahr ‘Umr, and the dairy farm at Harthah, the Bait Na‘mah Hospital, and the camp at Fao, and he recruits Arab guards for duty on the railway and elsewhere. A number of men are permanently employed by the Works Directorate and the Inland Water Transport.” 12. Miscellaneous : (1) Jail .—The Civil jail has been efficiently managed by the Superintendent and his Deputies, Mr. Finnimore and late Sergeant-Major Melling. The following paragraphs form the report of the Superintendent, Captain D. F. Borrie :— “ The population of the jail has remained about the same during the year, and any increase above the proper number of convicts has been rectified by the despatch of long-term convicts to India. In this way 30 pf. long-term convicts have been despatched, vide D.C.C.’s No. 6735/166/6, dated the 15th May 1918. The greatest number of convicts on any day was 30 /, compared with 286 during the previous year. “ The following tables show the number of prisoners passed through the jail during the year :— All classes remaining on the 1st January 1918 All classes received during the period - All classes released during the period - All classes remaining on the 31st December 1918 of all classes who have - 260 - 790 - 783 - 263fc r j ']^0 convicts received into tlie jciil tire clnssed ns lictbitunls nnd cnsunls . Habituals. Casuals. 15 239 “ of habitual convicts there are few, and most of these are Indians. The part of those classed under casual are not criminals in the real sense of the word. Many of their offences are technical, owing to the Occupation. Many more are sentenced to terms of imprisonment for having Government materials in their possession. These men are often not thieves in ordinary life, and only the ease with which Government stores can be got has tempted them to retain them. This class, after the war, will be unlikely to come to jail again. It is probable, therefore, that the total admissions for real offences will diminish as the chances for pilfering lessen. “ Most of the convicts are well-behaved in jail, but great difficulty is experienced in stopping the introduction into jail of prohibited articles, owing to the fact that convicts work outside in gangs in close proximity to the population. It will be seen later that, from this cause, the number of minor punishments is very large, while the number of major offences is small. Minor offences are mainly quarrelling, and possession of prohibited articles. “ Qf major offences, five were escapes, of which three were recaptured. I wo are still at large. In addition to these, a convict who escaped in 1917 was recaptured. Of the escapes, two were captured immediately outside the jail, they having got out along the creek, which runs through the jail. One, a woman, was placed in an open^room in the female jail (with a wardress sleeping beside her), owing to a very bad attack of pneumonia. She got out of a window, and wandered away in delirium. I fear her body lies in some creek, as no trace of her has been found yet, and as her condition was very critical. One escaped from a working party that was sent to Qurnah, vide D.C.C.’s No. 15,921, dated the 6 th November 1917. The party was disbanded shortly after. He was recaptured some time later. The fifth, who is still at large, escaped while under sentence of death. He was guarded by a policeman at his door and a warder on duty near the door. There is little doubt that the warder and policeman connived at his escape, opening the door by forcing the bolt. The warder and the policeman on duty at the time of the escape were sentenced by the Military Governor to two years and four years respectively. The convict is still at large. The other major offence was a murderous attack on a convict overseer, in the carpenters’ shop, by a convict serving five years for murder. The injured man recovered, and the convict who attacked him was sentenced to transportation for life. Minor offences were - 234 Major offences were ------ 6 “ (a) Warders .—Improvement is seen in the warder establishment, though they are still very poor. An increase in pay to Rs. 30/-, and Rs. 15/- ration allowance, and increase in the number employed, so as to allow of more reasonable hours, has led to a better class of men being available. Fifteen Soudanese have just arrived from Egypt for duty. They may be of great use, though their knowledge of drill is very small. All warders are now being drilled periodically in groups of 10. ‘‘( 6 ) Offences of Warders .—Of major offences there were three. One was sentenced to 2 years R.I. for “ allowing a condemned prisoner to escape.” One was sentenced to 3 months’ R.I. and 20 lashes, for “ Abetting a prisoner in communication with friends,” and the other, the Head Warder, was fined Rs. 50/, in default 21 days, for being absent for four days. He had to be brought to the jail by an escort. Taken all round, the general discipline of the jail has improved during the past 12 months. “ (c) Industrial, Outdoor .—The jail garden has been extended, and is now supplying a large quantity of vegetables to the jail. 6,093 lbs. have been supplied from the 2nd September 1918 to the 13th December 1918, equalling a sum worth while showing in accounts. The garden should do much better this year, as the initial work is done and few convicts are now needed for upkeep. “ General fFor&amp;.—Gangs of convicts have been supplied since April, at 12 annas per diem, to railways, brickfields, and municipality for general work. “From these sources, Rs. 13,913/4/- has been received for labour. The labour is considered good and there is a great demand for it. About 100 convicts workoutside daily. The work is very good for the health of the convicts, but unfortu nately, as said before, it interferes with the discipline of the jail, owing to the chances the convicts have of mixing with the population in crowded thoroughfares. This class of work should be discontinued as soon as possible, and it is owing to the extreme difficulty of obtaining other labour that the convicts are, for the present, used for this work. “ Indoor Work. —The carpenters’ shop has almost closed down, owing to the difficulty in obtaining timber. This is regrettable as several excellent carpenters are in jail at present. “ Breadmaking. —The bakery bakes all the bread for the jail and on this a saving of Rs. 7,494/1/2 has been effected. “ Coir Matting. —Making of coir matting is carried out as usual, but owing, to the rise in the price of coir, it is now very expensive, very little profit is made on it. 44 Envelope-making. —Envelope making for the Force is one of our most paying industries, and it is most useful, apart from profits, as it provides a good form of work for old and infirm convicts. Rs. 3,990/9/4 has been taken in payment for this work. 44 {d) Finance. —Cost of upkeep for the 12 months ending 31st December is Rs. 80,684/3/10. Rs. 5,700/15/1 has been spent on raw material, and the total profits from all labours amount to Rs. 18,833/-. The actual cost to Government, therefore, is Rs. 61,851/3/10. 44 The cost per head of diet has risen to 7 annas 11 pies owing to the great increase in the price of S. and T. stores, and also of local produce. The average cost per head of diet for the year is Rs. -/6/5. 44 (e) Equipment. —Equipment has also risen in price, so that the cost per head is nearly double that of last year, R. -/I/ll. 44 (/) Buildings. —The jail occupies the same buildings as last year. It is small and cramped and a new jail is required as soon as building material and labour are available. 44 [g) Medical. —Total admission to jail hospital during, the year is 349. Of this, 336 recovered; 13 died. The prevailing diseases were :— Malaria; venereal; eye disease; diarrhoea and dysentery; and minor accidents. 44 The minimum number of admissions on any one day was 29 (17th August). During September an outbreak of scurvy occurred, there being 22 cases in all. Most of these only suffered from sore gums. Prompt measures to ensure a full diet of meat and vegetables stamped it out at once. No deaths occurred. The general health of convicts has been good.” (2) Acquisition. —The expenditure of 20 lakhs of rupees on the acquisition of land occupied by, and in, the neighbourhood of the new port at Ma w qil has been sanctioned, and a special officer, styled the Acquisition Officer, has been appointed to carry out this duty. Captain Bourdillon, I.C.S., who drew up the regulation under which compulsory acquisition of all lands required for public purposes may be made on conditions prohibitive of speculation, was appointed Acquisition Officer, but was unable to proceed with the work owing to illness. Captain Brown, I.C.S., succeeded him, and is now engaged in preliminary inquiries as to ownership and values under the terms of the regulation. He has made rapid progress, which will ensure the speedy application of the funds made available. It will then be for consideration what further lands should be acquired in this district for the development of Basrah in whatever manner may be deemed essential to its future interests. (3) The Development of Basrah. —Consideration of the question of the develop ment of Basrah has been lately accorded official recognition. With peace in sight it is matter of urgent concern that the future of the toAvn and port be envisaged with a view to the drawing up of plans which will ensure ordered and economical evolution. So many alternatives present themselves to view that it is not merely the allotment of space in a given area that we have to decide. We have a new port already in great part constructed, and an old town in existence some miles distant from it. ”The port is fixed, and we have to ask ourselves whether we shall abandon the town and lay out our new plan on virgin ground Without reference to the existing town or to immediate local interests, or whether we shall begin from282 our existing position in the town we have, and endeavour to order its growth in the line of natural development which would ensue without forcible direction. Meetings have been held to ascertain the views of the local inhabitants and of the European and American trading community, but no definite decision has been reached. The subject is one of urgency, in that there is strong demand for the construction of business offices, warehouses, and of residential quarters, all of which are required immediately. But it would be a mistake to embark on a scheme not fully matured, and it is matter of regret that this contingency was not kept in view and officially examined, as military works have progressed throughout the long period of army occupation—a warning continually urged by myself during the past 18 months. (4) Court of Wards .—The following paragraphs are taken from the report of Chaudhri Allah Bakhsh, B.A., who succeeded Khan Sahib Mirza Muhammad as President of the Court of Wards on 3rd April. He has shown ability, keenness and tact in the conduct of his duties and his physical activity in visiting his estates has contributed very largely to the success of his work. (a) Extension of Jurisdiction .—On 1st April 1918 the jurisdiction of the Court of Wards was extended to the whole of the Basrah district under G.O.C., Regulation No. 2 of 1918. G.O.C., Regulation No. 2 of 1915 was repealed and the new “ Court of Wards Regulation ” was substituted therefor. It came into force from the 1st August 1918 and the control of the Court of Wards was transferred from the Senior Judicial Officer to the Political Officer, Basrah, from the same date. (b) Estates in Charge .—At the beginning of the year there were 40 estates under management amounting to Rs. 6,93,078/4/- in the aggregate. Sixteen estates aggregating Rs. 4,63,420/8/- were taken over during the year under report. These include one estate under provisional superintendence for which the Civil Commis sioner’s sanction is awaited. Superintendence was withdrawn from one estate of the value of Rs. 10,795/-, the wards having attained majority. Partial superin tendence was withdrawn from two other estates aggregating Rs. 17,697/14/- for similar reason, thus leaving 55 estates aggregating Rs. 11,28,635/14/- under the superintendence of the Court of Wards at the close of the year. Of these, six belong to Jews and the rest to Mohammedans. There are no estates under management belonging to Christians. (c) Income.—The gross income of the estates rose from Rs. 1,10,437/4/- to Rs. 2,76,005/-, including Government levy. The net income rose from Rs. 78,208/- to Rs. 1,23,443/6/11. During the year the yield of date crop was far below the normal, but this deficiency was made up in better prices prevailing this year as compared with last year. There was good prospect of increase under rents of buildings. The promulgation of the Rent Restrictions Rules in July 1918, however, adversely affected the incomes under this heading. Of the 16 estates taken over this year, four came under management so late in the year that no income could be collected. (d) Expenditure .—The total gross expenditure, inclusive of loans advanced and investments made, rose from Rs. 1,30,486/- to Rs. 2,25,691/-. The increase is due to a large number of loans advanced and payment of the shares of wards from whose estates the superintendence was withdrawn during the year. (e) Investment of Savings. Considerable sums of money are advanced in loans at 12 per cent, per annum interest. Rs. 98,319/6/- were due in 1918. Of this, Rs. 87,273/6/- were recovered and Rs. 11,046/- are outstanding. A sum of Ks. 11,446/12/— was earned as interest during the year. Loans to the value of Ivs. 1,02,350/6/— were issued during the year under report. Of a total of 72 loans issued during the year, 51 loans amounting to Rs. 33,439/— were given on personal security, and 21, amounting to Rs. 68,911/6/—, on mortgage of landed property. Investment of savings on purchase of gardens and house property is a profitable expedient and is looked upon by the local Mallak with much favour. Moreover, immovable piopeity is moie secure than cash in the hands of a young ward newly taking up the responsibility of managing his own estate. Action has been taken in this direction towards the close of the year, and it is proposed to spend more money on purchase of immovable properties in future. (f) Loans. There has been no difficulty in recovering the loans with interest. There are more applications for loans than the Court of Wards can advance. This i' s ( lue to the fact that our rate of interest (viz., 12 per cent, per annum) is lower than that of the town moneylender, who charges as much as 25 per cent, per annum. Besides that, the Court of Wards loans save all the annoyances accompanying aloan from a regular moneylender. A suggestion for the increase of our rate of interest has been given up on the consideration that it makes the transaction less secure. With savings accumulating year after year, the number of transactions is daily increasing. This will be met by the diversion of capital from loans to purchase of immovable properties and cultivation of gardens. (g) Collection of Estates' 1 Dues. —The incomes of the Courts of Wards’ estates are derived chiefly from three sources, viz., house rents, produce of gardens and interest on loans. A complete list of all immovable property, comprising gardens, with full details, has been prepared on a form approved by the Senior Judicial Officer this year. A demand register of all house property was prepared and systematic quarterly collection of rents introduced. There are 193 buildings in all under the management of the Court of Wards. The President was able to visit all the estates twice during the past nine months. A point was made of deciding all cases affecting properties on the spot. This has kept the President in close touch with the fallahs. (h) Sale of Dates. —The date produce of most of the big gardens was farmed for cash. Out of a total value of the year’s date crop, estimated at Rs. 71,000/-, a sum of Rs. 58,445/- was thus realised. The customers had a very sanguine view of the date prices this year and consequently we realised a very good sum. The estate of Haji Ibrahim al Zuhair, taken over this year, fetched a record price. Our other procedure was to farm the produce to fallahs in kind. This was done in some of the gardens that remained undisposed of. This method is not profitable, and it is not looked upon by the Mallaks with much favour. Direct collection was arranged in the remaining gardens, as the offers of the fallahs were not acceptable. This method has its own drawbacks. It is not always possible to get a trustworthy watchman and a good man seldom takes up the job. Naturs were, however, appointed in consultation with the village headman and occasional surprise visits were made to the gardens. (j) Suits for Debt. —There were five decrees payable at the beginning of the year. The judgment debtors having failed to satisfy the claim, applications were made in two cases for execution of decrees against their person. The first has served his six months and has been released and the second is in jail. The third is in Bombay and action has been postponed pending his return. It is now proposed to apply for execution against the property of the second judgment debtor. The property of the first would not sell, as he is a tribal Arab, and a moneyed townsman is loth to make a bad investment. The judgment debtors in two other cases are too poor to pay anything, and the estates are too poor to maintain them in jail. (k) Damage to Property. —Damage was done to five gardens by reason of their beino- occupied by the troops. Compensation has been applied for in three cases for date-trees cut down and in five cases for damage caused by the closing of water channels and consequent failure of date crop. These are under investigation by the Compensation Officer. A sum of Rs. 1,555/- has been recovered during the year for compensation applied for in the preceding year. (l) Claims of Estates. —Several claims of different estates were investigated durino- the year. Some of them were found barred by limitation. In one case, however, the debtor was too honest to take advantage of limitation and he was kind enough to give a new bond binding himself to pay the claim in 24 months* Rs. 7,884/- in all were collected in claims. There was one important pre-emption suit pending in the Junior Court at the beginning of the year. After several hearings it was decided in favour of the Court of Wards. Three new suits were instituted during the year. Two were decided in favour of the Court of Wards, and the third was 'adjourned sine die, the defendant having died before the case came up for hearing. All these cases were pursued by the President in person. (m) Brick Kiln. The Court of Wards came in possession of a ruined brick kiln, situate at Qurmat Ali, on taking over the estate of Haji ‘Ali Khaqi this year. The' kiln was repaired and worked. Bricks have been successfully burnt for the first time, but no definite results can be recorded this year, as the military have temporarily stopped the purchase of bricks. It is hoped that it will prove a profitable business, but it requires constant supervision and watching. (n) Government Revenues and Taxes .—The total amount which the estates paid to Government on account of revenue* &amp;c.* was Rs. 5,61 o/4/9. Rs, 3,614/15/9 werepaid on account of land revenue and Rs. 2,000j^j— on account of house tax. Remission of land revenue was applied for in three cases. This was not granted. (o) Cost of Management. —The Court of Wards’ office and establishment lived on the charity of the Law Courts up to 1st of April 1918. It now stands on its own feet. 5 per cent. Government levy, amounting to Rs. 4,410/-, was collected for the year 1917 from the net incomes of the estates under management. (p) Maintenance and Education of Wards. —The total amount under this head was Rs. 19,259/5/- as against Rs. 10,577/- spent in the previous year. There are 30 families receiving maintenance of Rs. 1,572/- every month. There are 81 wards in all. Of these, 31 males and 18 females are of schoolgoing age. There were 11 male wards at school at the beginning of the year, and 11 more were sent during the year 1918. Total number of wards attending school came to 22 at the close of the 'year. In the case of female wards of schoolgoing age, action is confined to advising the guardians to provide for their religious education. (q) Education of Wards. —The effective control of the wards presents the greatest difficulty. Relatives and guardians are generally indifferent to the education of wards. The stoppage and reduction of maintenance allowances was used as a lever to make them send the ivards to school, and maintenance allowances were in some cases paid only on the production of a letter from headmasters saying that the wards had been admitted into school and were regular in attendance. The opening of Government schools at Basrah and ‘Ashar has made it easy for several of the young boys to attend the school. The school at Bait Wali was too far for young children of tender age. The introduction of religious education into Government Schools is looked upon with much favour by the Mohammedan population. Three students were consequently withdrawn from the American Mission school and sent to Government primary schools. There are only four boys at the American Mission, three of whom are boarders and one is studying in the secondary department. There are two wards studying at the Cathedral high school, Fort Bombay, and their conduct and progress are reported to be excellent. Considerable difficulty was felt in keeping three young wards of Khalid Pasha al ‘Ami’s estate at school. They came from Zubair and were in the habit of running away to the place, one by one, so that the office peons had sometimes to be employed to fetch them. This difficulty was overcome by the appointment of an old slave of the family as their muhafidh. They are now behaving well. (r) Training of Wards in Trade. —Wards of grown-up age are assisted in acquiring experience of some profession. One ward, coming from Salih Effendi Khaiyal’s estate, has been advanced Rs. 1,000/- to open a shop. An apprenticeship was obtained for another ward of ‘Abdul Wahid’s estate in the military mechanical shops. He is now learning the work of a motor-boat driver and receives Rs. 45/- per month. Government service has been obtained for four wards in the Police Department during the year under report. (s) Payments of Debts and existing Liabilities. —Out of a total of 55 estates, 43 are entirely free from debt. The number of encumbered estates was 12 at the close of the year. 28 claims, amounting to Rs. 76,264/-, were received against the ' estates under the management of the Court of Wards during the year. These were minutely examined and 19 of them, amounting to Rs. 40,642/7/6, were proved to be valid and accepted. Rs. 11,14//— have been paid in satisfaction of nine claims out of the current incomes of the estates. It is open to all claimants to institute suits against the Court of Wards when a claim has been refused, but none has done so, so far. (t) Death Reports. A total number of 83 death reports were received during the year. The prevalence of influenza brought in a very large number of death reports in the months of October and November. On the receipt of a report, a local inquiry was immediately made and report submitted to the Political Officer. The anxiety of the Government to protect the rights of the orphans and disabled persons has thus been thoroughly impressed upon the minds of the public. It is not seldom that administrators and executors of wills play havoc with their charge, while wills are sometimes forged by greedy relatives. The reputation and character o! the \\ asi were, therefore, always inquired into and in doubtful cases they were required to apply to the District Court for probate of will. These local inquiries■ “A . • afford considerable opportunities of studying^ local conditions. For instance, it was found that in most cases the lands were not registered in tapu. (u) Applications for Superintendence .—There were 19 applications asking for assumption of superintendence of estates during the year. Four of these were sanctioned by the Senior Judicial Officer and two by the Political Officer, and 13 were refused. The number of applications submitted testifies to the appreciation by the public of the advantage of management by the Court of Wards. Much favourable comment has been made by the public on the assumption of the superintendence of the estates of Haji Ibrahim al Zubair, Sion Nassim and Haji ‘All al Khafi. The first estate was saved from the hands of a young heir, who was hurling it headlong into ruin. He was an enthusiastic visitor of theatres and undesirable quarters and is now a useful member of society and an officer of police. The major daughters in the estate have received their share for the first time. The minor children, with their mother, who had suffered most, now receive a monthly allowance. The second, named Sion Nassim, was addicted to excessive drinking, and was starving his wife and young children. The wife made an application to the Senior Judicial Officer for assumption of superintendence. Sion Nassim was declared malign and the estate was handed over to the Court of Wards. Action was taken to close all the public-houses to this man. He is now behaving better. In the third estate, ‘Abdul Khudhair, the eldest son of the family, found himself in full possession of a big landed property and a considerable amount of cash, shared by a long line of children. He lost his head and was declared malign by the District Court before much loss could be done to the estate. He was kept under medical treatment and is now under training in the police lines. He is likely to become a useful Government servant. Much interest was excited bv a Beduin woman of Shuraifat tribe. She had &gt; married a Mallak of Hamdan and had a son by him. She had returned to her tribe after the death of her husband and had taken the boy with her. The uncle of the child was misappropriating the boy's share of income from the property. She found her way to the Court of Wards and the estate was taken over with the sanction of the Political Officer. She next applied for money. The estate was small and the income hardly enough for the education of the ward. She was asked to leave the boy at Basrah, so that he may be sent to school. She has disappeared with the bov and has not been heard of since. The incomes are being collected and will be handed over when the boy comes of age. (v) Caution .—In making any further extension of the jurisdiction of the Court of Wards, it will be advisable to proceed with caution in the light of experience crained. The townsman is familiar with the work of the C ourt and welcomes its interference. But it is a new thing to the country people. Phis was shown in the difficultv experienced in dealing with fallahs in the Nahiyah of Shatt-al- Arab, which is a tribal area. They Were, however, handled with moderation and firmness with good results. APPENDICES. APPENDIX A. Land Revenue for the Year 1018-19.

Political and Tribal.— The tribes of the Qurnah Division, with three exceptions, are all in the Ahl al Jazair confederacy. These three exceptions are Dair, Nashwah, and Suwaib; but, even of these, Dair and Suwaib are so closely connected with the confederacy as almost to be regarded as members of it. Whether the Albu Salih, under Badr al Rumaiyidh, which are now included in the Nasiriyah Division, belong actually to the Ahl al Jazair is at present a moot point, but they are claimed as members by the other Ahl al Jazair shaikhs. If Albu Salih are not Ahl al Jazair, then the whole confederacy in included in this Division, and the western boundary of the Division in the Hammar Lake marks the boundary between the Ahl al Jazair and the Bani Khaiqan. The boundaries of the Division have been finally decided during the year, and are as under Eastern Boundary, from Pillar No. 14 on the Turco-Persian line to a point 3 miles north of parallel 31*15 North long. Northern Boundary, from this point runs almost due West along the boundary between Albu Muhammad and Bani Malik lands to the river, which it reaches \ mile below Ezra’s Tomb. It runs diagonally across the river and leaves it | mile above the Tomb. From there it follows the same tribal boundary to a point about 2 miles south of Saiqal. Eastern Boundary. —Due south from this point past Al-‘Abid (included) to Hammar (Bani Hutait), where it runs through the middle of the village. Thence it passes south of Mukabbah, and west of Tbadah (following the Albu Shamah and Bani Hutait tribal boundary) in a south-westerly direction across the lake. From the high-water mark of the lake southwards to Luqait station (excluded). Southern Boundary. —From Luqait Station (excluded) along the northern edge of the Basrah-Nasiriyah Railway to Rumailah Station (excluded), thence to ‘Aluwi (excluded) and north-east through the marsh fro Nahr Shudhail, the northern boundary of the Nahr ‘Umar estate, and down this Nahr to the river. The line runs diagonally across the river to the mouth of the Nahr Abu Gharab and follows the existing boundary between Nashwah and Zuraiji along the Abu Gharab, the Urman Canal and the Abu Tabar Channel, until it reaches the desert, where it goes in a straight line to No. 14 boundary pillar. The division has not yet been divided into districts, but it is proposed to do so as soon as another political officer is available. The new officer will be in charge of the Hammar district, which will include Ibadah, Bani Musharraf, Bani Hutait, Al Husaini, and Chabaish, and will have its headquarters at Bani Hutait. It will, perhaps, be best to take each Nahiyah separately and note on each. (1) Sakhrichah. —This Nahiyah runs along both banks of the Tigris from Ezra’s Tomb inclusive to Nahr ‘Ajaimi, where it joins the Nuhairat Nahiyah. It contains the Bani Malik tribe, who live between Nahr Ajaimi and Sakhrichah, the Albu Bukhit, Bait Haddad, and one small section of the Al Fartus. These tribes all live on the right bank of the river. On the left bank there are only two small settlements, one at Al Khidhr at the mouth of the Rot ah Canal, and Silk Humaiyun south of the Rotah Canal. These two settlements are composed of a mixture of tribes, who cultivate the lands round their settlements. They own allegiance to no big shaikh, but are under the authority of theii \ illage headman. The Bani Malik were originally nominally under Shaikh Malzum, but he never appears to have had much control over any but his own section of the tube, and finally there remained three definite sections, each under its own head. It was found impossible to deal with these other sections through Shaikh Malzum, and so in September 1917 Muhammad Nuri, an ex Turkish official, was appointed Mudir. He at first showed signs of capability, and appeared to be doing well; but later fell away, and there was more than a suspicion that he had been mixed up with robberies of supply trains, and he was accordingly dismissed in February 1918,300 and Shaikh Qubashi was appointed Mudir in his place. This step received a little feeble opposition from Malzum, but Qubashi soon made good his position, and now has the Bani Malik thoroughly in hand. The Albu Bakhit are a lawless marsh tribe, inhabiting the marshes along the railway between Sakhrichah and Ezra’s Tomb. They had given considerable trouble in petty thefts from the road and river, but they surpassed all their previous efforts by perpetrating robberies on a big scale from supply trains, and it was with these people that Muhammad Nuri was suspected of conniving. In January, five of their villages were burnt, and that action was effectual in stopping their thefts, the more so as immediately after that action had been taken a spell of particularly cold wet weather was experienced. Shaikh Qubashi has them now well in hand, and they are giving no trouble. Bait Haddad and the section of the A1 Fartus near Ezra’s Tomb are well- behaved semi-marsh tribes, whose chief occupation is breeding buffaloes. Almost all the land in this Nahiyah belongs to the Mandils of Basrah, and is very fertile. Owing to road and railway construction having taken away all the people, no cultivation was done during the first three years of British occupation; but this year the whole of the cultivable land was made use of and good results obtained. The people are good cultivators and, the women especially, good coolies for building bunds and making roads. (2) Nuhairat, Bani Mansur, and Muzair'ah .—The Nuhairat Nahiyah includes also Nahr al Pasha and Huwair al Sa‘ad. Its Shaikh is Qubashi, who is a man of very great influence and no small capability. He keeps his Nahiyah in good order, and readity gives any assistance he can in the work of Government. The tribesmen are closely related to those of Bani Mansur and to MuzaiFah, though the latter has a considerable admixture of tribesmen from Huwaizah district. They are mostly river men and the bulk of the muhailah crews are recruited from them. • Of Bani Mansur, half is enclosed by a circular bund and half is not, the former part being very well kept, containing very fine date gardens and producing some wheat. The unenclosed part has patches of date-trees and produces a considerable quantity of millet. The Muz air 4 ah lands are owned by ‘Abdul Karim ibn Falih Pasha al Sa‘dun and have been sequestrated during the war. Much of the estate has not been cultivated within the memory of man. The inhabitants of MuzaiPah are industrious cultivators, who make the best use of the land which can be cultivated. Nuhairat, Bani Mansur, and Muzair ah are all under Shaikh Qubashi, and each Division of the Nahiyah is under the direct supervision of one of his sons, Jasim being responsible to him for Bani Mansur, Qata‘*for Muzair‘ah, and Paris assisting him at Nuhairat. (3) Suwaib. The Suwaib Nahiyah lies on the left bank of the Suwaib River and the left bank of the Shatt al Arab, but includes also an estate on the right bank of the Suwaib River which belongs to Haji Musa al ‘Ataiyah of Basrah.° Shaikh Chiyad has a somewhat flimsy hold over most of the tribesmen, as those on the Shatt al Arab, who are settled and belong to the Maivah tribe, are very largely under the influence of Saiyid Musa, who is no friend of Chiyad’s, while the tribesmen along the Suwaib are nomads who live part of the year in Suwaib and part of the year in Huwaizah. The greater part of the Nahiyah becomes totally submerged during the flood season, and the only cultivation is done on a small strip of land along the Shatt al Arab and on small pieces at the mouth of the Suwaib. There is considerable ill-feeling between Suwaib and Nashwah, which is always liable to give a little trouble. t This Nahiyah, which lies along the left bank of the Shatt al Arab from the boundary of the Suwaib Nahiyah to the boundary of the Basrah Sanjaq opposite Nahr Umr, has suffered very largely from the drain of coolie labour for Basrah The destruction caused by the high floods of 1914 and 1915 caused considerable agricultural depression, and the bait offered by the high wages prevalent m Basrah drew away large numbers of the inhabitants of Nashwah. These have remame m asrah, leaving their lands uncultivated, and the result is that there are scarcely enough people left to cultivate the lands at their disposal. In this Nahiyah the cultivated belt on the river bank widens considerably, but the lands have for a long time been badly tended, with the result that what was once covered with date gardens is now almost innocent of trees, though the gardens immediately round the village are well tended and fruitful. The Mandils and certain Sa‘dunsare said to have mulk rights in all or part of the land, but no claims from them have yet been received. Shaikh ‘Abdul Hadi al Suwaichit keeps his tribe well in hand, but is much depressed at the loss of his cultivators, and frequently complains that he can make no improvements in his nahiyah for want of men. A road from Huwaizah, known as the Darb Nashwah, comes in here, and it is said to be passable for horses all the year round, as it only floods in one or two places, and even then to no great depth. (5) Dair .—The nahiyah of Dair is situated on the right bank of the Shatt al Arab from Nahr ‘Umr to Sharish. There were two houses in Dair each claiming the shaikhship, one headed by Ahmad al Rashid and the other by Hachim al Sa‘ud. As a result of a fight between the two parties these two men were both exiled to Basrah and ‘Ati al Sa‘ad, a half-brother of Shaikh Qubashi, was appointed Mudir. He was at first very weak and seemed quite unable to assert himself, but he has now improved and is doing well. Ahmad al Rashid and Hachim al Sa‘ud have now been allowed to return to Dair. The survey and record of rights about to be made in Dair will be dealt with under Revenue. The people of Dair claim to be of Rabi‘ah extraction. (6) Sharish .—Sharish is a thickly populated nahiyah lying along the right bank of the Shatt al ‘Arab from the junction of the Euphrates and the Tigris to the Dair boundary. Its Shaikh, Husain al Fadhl, is of ‘Anizah extraction, while most of the tribesmen belong to the Halaf tribe. They are good cultivators and make good use of all the land at their disposal. Shaikh Husain had for some time considerable trouble in bringing to heel one of his mukhtars, who had assumed an independent attitude; but, with Government behind him he has now made his position good, and has the whole tribe well under control. A landing-place for aeroplanes has been reserved at Sharish and a store for petrol and lubricating oil has been erected on the spot. (7) Madinah .—Madinah always has been a troublesome nahiyah, and it does not yet show any signs of improvement. During the lifetime of Shaikh Hamid the mukhtars gave frequent trouble with their complaints against him that he was treating them too hardly. On his death they all agreed to help and obey Hamid, a boy of 15, who was Hamid’s eldest surviving son, and Hamid was accordingly made Shaikh and Mudir. He elected to take as his mustashar Mizyad ibn Habib, a man little known to us at the time, and refused Saiyid Abdul Hasan, who had been his late father’s mustashar. Mizyad soon showed signs of being quite unfitted for his position, but Hamid would listen to no word against him until, in Ramadhan 1917, he was proved to have been systematically robbing Hamid, and he was accordingly banished from the occupied territories. Meanwhile, in March 1917, Hassich had made his “ dakhalah ” and on the fall of Mizyad peace was made between him and Hamid through the medium of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, and Hassich became Hamid’s mustashar. Hamid, however, had never really liked Hassich and soon began to grow jealous of him. This jealousy was played on by Muhammad al Jasim, a cousin of Hamid’s, who had wormed his way into the boy’s affections, with the result that an estrangement took place between Hamid and Hassich, and Hamid at once took to himself Muhammad ibn Jasim as mustashar, although warned not to do so on several occasions by me and also by Colonel Howell. This combination was by no means a success and complaints against Muhammad al Jasim and Hamid began to be received from all sides. Muhammad al Jasim was removed from Madinah and made to live in Qurnah, in the hope that away from such an evil influence Hamid would recover from his bad ways He has not done so, however, but has succeeded in estranging from himself all the mukhtars, even those who had hitherto supported him most loyally, with the result that they are now clamouring for his removal. Hamid has been given his last chance and has been told by the Civil Commissioner that, unless he changes his ways at once, other arrangements will have to be made for the shaikhship of Madinah. The ruling house at Madinah is of the ‘Amarah tribe and.the tribesmen are of mixed origin and are known collectively as the Siyamar. They are largely river men and supply large numbers of boats and crews to the muhailah fleet, most of which boats are built at Huwair or Khas. , There is also at Madinah a considerable Sabeaan element, most of whom live at Khas or Khumaisah and are employed as boatbuilders, ironworkers and silver smiths.302 The main part of the nahiyah, namely the part situated on the right bank of the Euphrates, is enclosed by a circular bund and contains good date gardens, but that on the left bank is, except for small isolated gardens, unenclosed and open to floods. There are, however, good date gardens on the left bank at Huwair. (8) Chabaish .—In Chabaish too there was at the beginning of the year considerable trouble. Shaikh Majid, who had been made Shaikh of Chabaish when Shaikh Salim had been sent to India as a prisoner of war, had proved consistently unsatisfactory. In November it was found necessary to remove him, and Shaikh ‘Abdul Hasan was appointed Mudir. He did not act with sufficient tact in his dealings with the people, and was suspected of having taken bribes from several parties and consequently he so enraged the people against him that he had to be removed. It was then decided to make Ealih, Shaikh Salim’s young brother, Wakil-Shaikh until Salim should come back from India. No small difficulty was experienced in finding him a mustashar, but, after a time, Salih al Hajjaj, the Basrah agent of the Chabaish Shaikhs, was persuaded to accept the position, and things have since then been satisfactory. Salih has shown ability in his work, tact in dealing with the people, and commendable firmness in dealing with his young ward, and Falih should have learned a lot from him. Falih is intelligent, but very ignorant, but it is hoped to get him away to school shortly. He should then be of use as a Government servant. With the cessation of hostilities Shaikh Salim will soon return to Chabaish and another change will take place. He will be welcomed there, as he is extremely popular. Chabaish is divided into two sections: the Bani Asad, to which the ruling house belongs, and the Al Ghuraij. There has always been antagonism between the two sections, partly no doubt owing to the partiality shown by the shaikhs for the Bani Asad, but the feeling has now improved and there has been no trouble between them for some time. The Bani Asad tribesmen are chiefly employed in making mats, while the Al Ghuraij tribesmen are boatbuilders and cultivators. Here, too, there is a strong Sabaean element. They claim to have been very much oppressed under the Turks, but no complaints of oppression have been made of late. (9) Bani Hutait .—The nahiyah of Bani Hutait includes Bani Hutait, Bani Musharraf, Al Husaini and Tbadah. In the flood season the greater part of the nahiyah is submerged, but in the low flood season there is a large area which produces rice and millet. The nahiyah is in charge of a Mudir, Ibrahim al ‘Amari, who was appointed in November 1917 when Saiyid ‘Abdul Hasan was transferred to Chabaish. He had a very difficult position for some time owing to the intrigues of Sabti ibn Shunaiyan, the late Shaikh of Bani Hutait, whose idea was to keep the mukhtars in a constant state of opposition to the mudir in order to discredit him in the eyes of Government. He succeeded in causing constant trouble, but since his death in August there has been no further trouble. The four Mukhtars of Bani Hutait signed an agreement to keep the peace and to keep their hamulahs in order, and were made directly responsible to the Mudir for the good behaviour of their hamulahs. Bani Musharraf is owned entirely by Mutlaq al Humad as Sa‘dun and is almost entirely submerged in the flood season. It is divided into seven hamulahs, each with its mukhtar directly responsible to the mudir. One of these mukhtars, Faraj al Dahash, picked a quarrel with two other mukhtars in June, but his troubles were easily settled. Al Husaini is a small piece of land adjoining Bani Musharraf and under its Mukhtar, Qannas al Mozan. It is important as being one of the principal stopping places on the mahailah route from Suq al Shuyukh and Nasiriyah to Qurmat ‘Ali. Ibadah lies to the west of Bani Musharraf and is divided into four hamoulahs, each with its mukhtar. Of these by far the most influential is Haji Sharif al Haji Asad, who is rapidly spreading his influence over the mukhtars of Bani Musharraf. He is most helpful in all matters connected with the affairs of the nahiyah and is of the greatest assistance to the mudir. The spread of his influence alarmed his next-door neighbour and rival, Yasir al Najm, who immediately tried to pick a quarrel with him and caused some trouble for a time. The cause of the quarrel was the boundaries of the two hamoulahs, but the matter was settled to the satisfaction of both parties by refereece to the ‘ Ahl al Khibrah.’ Every year at the harvest time in Hammar there is a large influx of Arabs from the Gharraf, who come to assist in gathering in the harvest, and cause trouble when they depart by stealing everything they can lay their hands on.(10) Ma l dan .—-The Ma‘dan are in this district by no means a negligible element. Almost every Shaikh has his own Ma‘dans, who are regarded as a valuable asset to his nahiyah. On them the Shaikh is dependent for the reeds and mats with which to build his mudhif, and to a very large extent for his milk and ghi, for large herds of buffaloes are kept by them. Naturally a wild and uncontrollable element, they frequently endanger the tranquillity of the district by indulging in impromptu battles in the marshes. Usually there are no casualties, but if there are and the two sides in the contest belong to different shaikhs, the shaikhs at once rush to the Political Officer declaring that his tribe has been attacked and demanding reparation. Probably the wildest and most troublesome of the Ma'dans are the A1 Partus and the Shighanbar, living near A1 ‘Abid in the Chabaish nahiyah. During the flood season they come down to the Euphrates and make travelling by night by muhailah a matter of no small risk. To obviate the risk of such robberies muhailahs and balams are not allowed to pass Madinah if going up stream, or Chabaish if going down stream, unless there is a reasonable chance of reaching Chabaish or Madinah before dark. 2. Revenue : (a) Land Revenue .—The total demand of land revenue in this Division for the year ending 31st March 1919 is Rs. 207,146/1/6, and of this sum Rs. 100,996/8/- had been collected up to the end of December 1918. This is well above the demand for the year ending 31st March 1918, when the demand was Rs. 154,463/1/9. The desirability of the speedy abolition of the Khars was well shown in the absurd and utterly useless assessment made by the Khawaris this year in Hammar. The man who was sent with the Khawaris as clerk and who knew little or nothing about crops appears to have taken things into his own hands and paid no heed to' the estimate made by the Khawaris, but to have put down fanciful figures of his own. It is to be hoped that some better means of assessing the Government share in the produce will soon be devised. i • . p • An interesting piece of work is about to commence in the nahiyah of Dair, where a survey and record of rights will be made. While an examination of a comparatively unimportant land dispute was in progress an unexpected spirit o conciliation in the matter of ownership of the land was found to exist between the Sa‘dun overlords and the local inhabitants. A little discussion elicited facts which shed rays of light on the actual state of affairs, and the result was that I felt justified in proposing an experimental land settlement. The proposal was approved by the Civil Commissioner and preliminary investigation of titles commenced, partly in Qurnah and partlv before the Revenue Officer, Basrah wilayat. Though further examination showed that the question of ownership was not quite so simple as had at first appeared, yet the examination has already brought to light several interesting points, and, as the work proceeds, no doubt facts will be obtained of considerable help in the final settlement of the difficult Sa dun question. (b) Tapu. There has been very little tapu work during the year, as the town of Qurnah is small and few transactions in land take place therein. It cannot be said that tapu has been much encouraged, as pressure of other work has made one hesitate to touch any cases which may provoke a controversy The extension of tapu work to the districts is quite impossible until land settlement is complete, as there seems to be hardly a square yard of ground which cannot draw out three or four claimants of ownership. (c) Warif There are only very small pieces of ground here belonging to the Waqf administration, and these are all well tended. No money has been spent on them but little can be done on such small places unless all the surrounding owners spend money on their estates in the building of bunds or the cleaning out of 0 Jd£Ljzi.r).0].s* (d) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues.—Vmlev these headings come (1) reeds and mats tax (21 fish tax, (3) ferry tax, and (4) kodah. The reeds and mats tax has been almost in abeyance owing to the fact that the whole output was required for Military purposes. Large numbers of mats have been produced at prices considerably below those paid in 1916 and the early part of 1917, and the supply for the civil population was confined to those mats which could be smuggled through the marshes and sold for Rs. 2/- each when they reached their destination. With the raising of the embargo on the sale of mats to the public, however, the amount collected In taxes should be by no means inconsiderable The collection of the tax for the remainder of the financial year is by farm, but at the beginmng of the new financial year arrangements will be made for direct collection.304 Fish tax has been confined to fish landed for sale in Qurnah itself. The ferry tolls at the Suwaib ferry are collected by a farmer and credited to the general revenues. The tolls at the ferry from Qurnah to Mazair‘ah are credited to the Qurnah municipality. Kodak .—The buffalo kodah was farmed for Rs. 8,350/-. As buffaloes are kept only by the Ma‘dan out in the marshes any count of them is quite impossible, and collection through the medium of a farmer is the only way to get the tax collected. The sheepi kodah has been abolished and compensated for by doubling the slaughter-house tax at .Qurnah and crediting half the proceeds to general revenues and half to the municipality. There is a slaughter-house in Madinah too, and the collection of the fees there was farmed this year for Rs. 455/-. (e) Customs.—Nil. (f) Compensation .—The compensations due for the damage done at the beginning of the operations in this country have now been estimated and await the sanction of the Military authorities. A large area at Qurnah was commandeered early in the campaign for wharves, railway sidings, and military lines, and no record of the damage done was kept. Whole date gardens were cut down and the face of the ground so changed that owners did not know where their boundaries had been. An estimation has now been made and boundaries of holdings reconstructed for the purpose to the satisfaction of all concerned. 3. Irrigation.— Although irrigation works on a large scale will be difficult, if not impossible, in the Qurnah Division until an effective check has been placed on the escape of the Tigris water down the Butairah and the Chahalah, yet the preliminary work has been done in preparation for some smaller works, and in one case plans have been formulated for a large and ambitious scheme. This large scheme is connected with the work of the dredgers in Hammar Lake. They have now dredged a channel right across the lake and have, by throwing the spoil on the south side, formed a bund which is everywhere nearly above high-water level, and in many places is entirely so. This is now being raised and revetted so that it will be preserved permanently above high-water level. The work of the dredgers alone, however, is of little or no avail for irrigation purposes, a^s the water of Hammar Lake, which hitherto spread itself to the south as soon as it reached A1 Ismafil, is now only kept in the lake until it reaches the end of the bund at Bani Hutait and then banks up behind it. Hence the spilling of the water over the south side of the lake is not prevented. The Irrigation Department have examined the question during the year and plans have actuallv been formulated for continuing by manual labour the dredger bund from Bani Hutait to Qurnah, and thus preventing the water from spilling over the south side of Hammar Lake, or the right bank of the Euphrates. Added to this bund are other necessary concomitants, such as the dredging out of the mouth of the Euphrates at Qurnah in older to allow of a greater discharge than at present. If these plans were put into execution it is estimated that about 700 square miles of what is now marsh would become available for cultivation. The amount of labour required for the work and the fact that it would be impossible at present to find cultivators for so large an area make it improbable that the scheme will be put into execution immediately, and, in view of the fact that the amount of earthwork required in the bund would be very considerably decreased if the Butairah were under control, it is not impi obable that its execution will be delayed until the Butairah has been attended to. Meanwhile, however, levels are being taken with a view to a smaller scheme, which will take advantage of the dredger bund and render cultivable the marsh immediately behind it. lo effect this it is proposed to build a cross bund through the marsh from the end of the dredger bund at Bani Hutait to some point on the Basrah—Nasiriyah Railway. The Irrigation Department has already taken levels across the niarsh from Bani Hutait to Luqait and now proposes to do so from Bani lutait to Ghabashiyah. A bund from Bani Hutait to either Luqait or Ghabashiyah would prevent the water banking up behind the dredger bund and would make p ±0 F ? u . va ^ 1 lon area considerable in extent, but not so big as to be impossible ot cultivation by the existing population. Only one irrigation scheme has actually been taken in hand during the year, and work on that is now in progress. The Muzair‘ah estate opposite Qurnah is owned by Abdul Karim ibn Falih Pasha al Sa‘dun and is now sequestrated. Abelt of land along the river bank varying in depth from a few yards to f mile is cultivated regularly, and behind this belt lies a wide plain which has not been cultivated within the memory of living man, largely because there is difficulty in obtaining sufficient water to grow crops there. This plain is liable to flood at the high flood season, but the water comes and goes so quickly that cultivation is not aided thereby. The soil was inspected by a member of the Agricultural Depart ment and pronounced good, and the irrigation Department was then asked to inspect the ground and see if its Irrigation was possible. The report was that, though a gravity canal was not possible, yet pump irrigation was possible, and plans were made to that end. One pump has been obtained and a considerable part of the canal has been completed. As the ground has not been cultivated for so many years, a question of escheat will arise, if ‘Adbul Karim’s tapu Sanad, which has not yet been seen, shows that the land is miri land. Hence, for the present, the irrigated land is to be run as a Government estate. Another piece of land inspected by the Irrigation Department was the ground running from the Snwaib River to Nahr Kutaiban. This piece, like Muzair‘ah, is submerged for a short time at high flood season, but not for long enough to make it of any use for cultivation. It was found here that the ground was so flat that pump irrigation would be uneconomical and the idea of irrigating this tract has been dropped for the present. Levels were taken, too, on a piece of ground known as the Muhairah, lying behind Bani Hutait. It was found, however, that the length and size of the bund required in proportion to the amount to be reclaimed and irrigated was such as to make the work unadvisable, and this too has been dropped. Though nothing has been done in the matter yet, it is hoped shortly to have levels taken in the marshes bordering on the Suwaib River with a view to making these marshes a large rice-producing area. The idea certainly sounds promising, and it is hoped that some move in the matter will shortly be made. There are several small schemes which might be worth while taking up, but to go into which the presence of an irrigation officer for the Qurnah Division would be necessary. At present for any work on the Euphrates reference has to be made to the District Irrigation Officer, Nasiriyah and for any work on the Tigris or the Shatt al Arab to the District Irrigation Officer, ‘Amarah, and it is often found that, owing to the pressure of larger schemes nearer home, they are unable to spare time to come and consider smaller schemes in this Division. Until, however, the population of the country is considerably increased it would appear to be more profitable to take up small schemes in which the whole of the ground reclaimed or irrigated can be at once brought under cultivation than to spend time even considering big schemes, the benefit of which cannot be felt for at any rate a generation. 4. Agricultural. —Winter crops were grown in this Division in 1918 almost for the first time since the British occupation of this country. This was so in the Bani Malik district, where no winter crops at all had been grown prior to this year. The winter crops in all parts of the nahiyah were a great success, as the rains were frequent and well distributed. The success of last year s winter crops has greatly encouraged the sowing of wheat and several areas are under cultivation this year which have not been cultivated hitherto. The summer crops were well up to the average ; but the influenza epidemic, which attacked this Division very badly, caused delay in harvesting them, and the heavy rain in the middle of November caused great damage, especially in the Hammar nahiyah, where the damage from all causes is now estimated at over 60 per cent, of the whole crop. The date crop was bad, the badness being entirely due to the ravages of the hashaf disease, which caused immense damage. The bacteriologist who went to examine the cause of the disease estimated the loss in this Division at 40 to 50 per cent, of the whole crop. In view of his opinion, that cultivation of the ground under the trees tends to prevent the disease, it is interesting to note that in this Division the greatest damage was caused in Madinah, where there is no cultivation under the trees, and the least damage in Sharish, where there is heavy cultivation under the trees. 5. Municipalities. —There is little to report concerning the municipality of Qurnah. The municipal council remains as before, and now meets regularly under306 the presidency of A.P.O. (Shabanahs), who does this work in addition to his duties as Shabanah Officer. The town is kept clean by the sanitary squad, which works under the orders of the Civil Surgeon. The most urgent needs of the town are, a new roof to the bazaar and more shops, baths, and water supply, and it is hoped that some, at any rate, of these needs will be attended to shortly. The difficulty of obtaining materials has prevented their being taken in hand hitherto, but, with the removal of the large demand for material for Military purposes, material for works of this nature should soon become available. An epidemic of petty burglaries broke out towards the end of November, but the action of the town guards and the Shabanahs quickly put an end to them, and none have since occurred. A census is now being made, and it is hoped shortly to have an accurate map made showing each house and compound. The meat supply is now in the hands of the municipality owing to troubles caused bv the local butchers, who refused to kill unless they were allowed to sell at exorbitant prices. After inquiry into the price of cattle and sheep and the expenses incurred by the butchers, a maximum price was fixed, and on their refusing to sell at that price the supply was taken over by the municipality and a profit is now accruing to municipal funds. There are advantages in having the supply of so important an article of food under municipal control, as the sanitary measures required are more easily carried into execution. . The shops are now under the direct supervision of the Civil Surgeon. During October an examination of various weights used in the bazaar was made, and it was found that many of the shopkeepers were giving short weights. Twelve shopkeepers, whose weights were very short, were fined and all shopkeepers were told to bring their weights for examination and check. Those checked were marked, and the correct weight was written on each one. This has had the effect of stopping complaints of short weight, and periodical inspections should have the necessary effect of making shopkeepers careful to keep their weights correct. A word of praise is due to the work of the Rais al Baladiyah, Saiyid ‘Abel ‘Ali. He takes keen interest in his work and is always ready to undertake any work for the improvement of the town and for its sanitation, while his advice on local matters is extremely useful and singularly free from bias. 6. Judicial. —During the year 36 criminal cases have been disposed of by the Political Officer direct, and 58 cases, criminal and civil, have been disposed of under the Tribal Criminal and Civil Disputes Regulation. The use of the Tribal Criminal and Civil Disputes Regulation takes a lot of work off the Political Officer’s shoulders, and often disposes of cases in a way which causes greater satisfaction to the people concerned than would a decision given by the Political Officer direct without reference to tribal customary law. Cases occurring in the municipal area are referred to the municipal council, and cases occurring in the districts are referred to the shaikhs or the mudir of the nahiyah in which the cases occurred or to which the disputants belong. When important cases arise which are considered too important to be dealt with by one man, a majlis of notables is appointed to sit and try the case. Their decisions in all such cases are not valid until confirmed by the Political Officer. Several boundary disputes in the Hammar Lake district were settled in this way. A man of note well-versed in local affairs was agreed on by both sides in the dispute, and they took an oath on the Quran to abide by his decision. The chosen man then walked along what he considered to be the boundary, having first taken an oath to mark out the boundary according to what as far as he knew was correct, and to show no bias for or against either party. This way of marking a boundary usually satisfies both parties, even though in some cases they feel that they have been wronged. In one case four men who had been caught by the Shabanahs for attempting to raid supply trains were tried by a Military court.' 7. Education. —The school at Qurnah is flourishing and many of the boys are taking great interest in their work. Early in the year, on the vacation of billets by the Military authorities, a house was obtained for the school and furniture was made locally, so that, as far as housing and furniture are concerned, the school is well equipped. There is, however, a lamentable lack of books, which forms a greatbar to satisfactory progress. Elementary English books are especially needed, and no printed English alphabets have yet been issued for school use, as the alphabet was omitted from the only book the masters have received. An examination was held in June before the summer holidays began, and prizes were given on the result of the examination. The result showed a satisfactory progress. A girls’ class has been started and eight small girls attend each day. One of them reads and writes Arabic well and assists at times in the instruction of the others. She is now beginning to learn English. I am convinced that this class would prosper greatly if a Muhammadan lady teacher could be obtained to take charge of it. An evening class has also been started for the instruction of men who are at work all day. Those who can already read and write Arabic are taught English and those who cannot are taught Arabic. The success of the school has largely been due to the energy and ability of the headmaster Khalil Amin. Being a Qurnah man he was able to persuade boys to attend the school who would not have come to another man. He, too, is entirely responsible for the institution of the evening classes. Now, however, his services have been placed at the disposal of the Judicial Department, and I am sure that, by his removal, education in Qurnah has received a distinct set-back. Not only has the native headmaster been removed, but for the present the school has to carry on with no English master, and so evening continuation classes will close, and I fear the local attendance will tend to go down. A school was opened at Madinah during the year. A house was placed at our disposal by Shaikh Hamid, and Saiyid Mirza was sent there as master. The average attendance is about 12, and the boys are making good progress with their work. No English is taught here, but any boy wishing to continue his education beyond the elementary stage can come in to the Qurnah school to do so. Football has been introduced into the school curriculum and has become very popular. The boys have not yet begun to have any idea of the rules, but they have now learned'to kick the ball properly and put great energy into their games. One boy from the Qurnah school has been sent to the teachers’ training school at Baghdad' and good reports have been received of his work there. 8. Medical and Sanitation.— A medical and sanitary report by Captain L Wynn Davies, R.A.M.C., Civil Surgeon, is attached hereto as Appendix A. Captain Wynn Davies has shown the greatest interest in his work here, and has gained the confidence of the Arab to a remarkable degree, and his departure from Qurnah would be a great loss. Many of the operations done m the Civil hospital have been the result of confidence not in the medical art, as propounded by English doctors in general, but solely of confidence in the medical art as propounded by Captain Wynn Davies personally. . . . f S Sarfaraz Husain, who was Sub-Assistant Surgeon here m the early part of the year, was able, through being a Shkah, to do much work which others might not have been able to do. _ * . . ,,. , T +1 Sub-Assistant Surgeon ‘Abdul Hamid, who is now here, is getting to know the people and to gain their confidence. Being a Sunni, however, he is regarded with mixed feelings in some quarters. 9. Police. —Nil. 10 Shabanahs— In the Shabanah force and its organisation very great change' has taken place during the year.. Until the beginning of March no attempt had ever been made to drill the Shabanahs of this district, and when the attempt was made the men at once took fright, and, under the conviction that they would all be made soldiers and sent to London or some other place overseas they all wanted to resign, and, in fact, desertions were frequent. After a good deal of nersuasion however, the bash chaush and the chaush, with some of the unbashiyah, were persuaded to come into Qurnah for a month to learn their drill and at the close of that time were sent back to their posts to instil as much as they could of vhat they had learned into the minds of the nafarat. This however did not remove from the minds of the majority of the men the fear that they would be sent abroad to fight and desertions continued to be frequent. More talking was necessary, but at this point the whole aspect of affairs was changed by the efforts of Mardan Mulazim who having become satisfied that there was no intention on the part o308 the Government to send Shabanahs away from the Qurnah Division, put his whole heart and soul into the business of bringing the men to their senses and getting them to do their drills. His efforts had good results and since then no trouble has been experienced in getting them to drill. On the contrary, they have got to like it, and take no small pride in themselves and their personal smartness. In August the experiment was tried of putting all the Shabanahs between Nahr ‘Umr and ‘Amarah under the control of one officer, who should have his headquarters at Ezra’s Tomb. The experiment was not a success, and toward the end of September an officer was sent to take charge of the Shabanahs of the Qurnah Division and another officer took charge of those in ‘Amarah Division. The Shabanahs, having an officer to themselves and a staff of British instructors, are now very much better looked after than was ever possible before, and the benefit of this improved supervision is apparent in the change in the appearance of the men. The men are all volunteers and, on enlistment, sign an agreement to serve for six months, at the end of which time it is open to them to renew the agreement or to resign. The men all come to Qurnah in turn for one month, during which time they do their drills and guards under the supervision of the British instructors. Their work includes 1|- hours per day drill, half an hour physical exercises, and half an hour musketry training, while as a rule they are on guard about one night in five. At the close of their month’s training they go on to range for their firing, the range at Qurnah having been put at their disposal by the Military authorities. When the first range practices were fired the S.S.O. Nabha Imperial Service troops kindly lent us a party of the Nabha Imperial Service troops, who were stationed in Qurnah, to instruct the Shabanahs in butts duties and also lent us the services of a bugler. A musketry course has been devised for the Shabanahs as under :— (i) Table A .—This is intended to enable men to get accustomed to their rifles and to pick out hopeless men before the classification practices commence. The practices are :— - Grouping. Lying. - Application. Lying with rest. - Snap shooting. Target exposed for 5 seconds. - Rapid. Five rounds in 30 seconds. - Application. Lying with rest. (a) 100 yards {b) 200 yards (c) 200 yards (d) 200 yards (e) 300 yards (ii) Table B .—No man fires in this table unless he does sufficiently well in Table A. In Table B the maximum possible is 140. Men scoring 95 or over are classified as marksmen; 75, or over, as first-class shots; 55 or over as second-class shots; and 40 or over as third-class shots. The practices are :— (a) 100 yards \b) 100 yards ,(c) 200 yards (d) 200 yards (e) 300 yards (/ ) 300 yards Grouping. Application. Application. Snap shooting. Application. Rapid. Lying. Standing in the open. Lying without rest. Target exposed for 5 seconds. Standing in a trench. Five rounds in 30 seconds. Of the 42 Shabanahs who have fired hitherto, 12 failed to qualify in Table A. Of the remaining 30, one qualified as marksman, four as first-class shots, and 11 scored under 40 points. Particular attention is paid to the discipline of the men, and it is satisfactory to record that there are very few men who have not maintained clean crime-sheets. A coffee-shop has been opened in the Shabanahs’ quarters at Qurnah, where the men can obtain their tea and coffee at a rate approximately half that at which it is obtained in the coffee-shops in the bazaar. The profits go to the welfare of the men themselves. In the early months of the year, when raids made by the Albu Bukhit on the railway line were frequent, the Shabanahs jiatrolled the whole line from Qurnah to Ezra’s Tomb every night and also for some months x^rovided the train guards. They caught four men raiding trains and killed three. Since then there have been no big robberies, though one or two petty cases of theft of wood and clothes have occurred. The Yuzbashi Hashim ibn Shaikh Qubashi lives in Sakhrichah, and, though he is no disciplinarian and no judge of the fitness of a man for promotion, thereis no doubt that the fact of his being Shaikh Qubashi’s son and heir does much to keep the Shabanahs together and to keep the tribes in order. Mulazim Hattab ibn Shaikh Qubashi has not been an unqualified success hitherto. He does not put enough backbone into his work and spends too much time worrying about his personal position. Mulazim Mardan as Sa‘ad is by far the best Arab officer in the Qurnah force. Keen and intelligent, he has a great influence over the men. It was largely through his efforts that the trouble over the dislike of drill was got over. 11. Labour. —-The demands for labour for military works have been very small during the year. A few coolies have been employed with the dredgers in Hammar Lake and a few on the maintenance of the railway and the Tigris marching road. Apart from these, no large numbers have been employed anywhere and the whole population has been enabled to devote its attention to the development of the land and the repair of the necessary bunds. 12. Miscellaneous.—N il. 13. Establishment and Personnel.— In the early part of the year Lieut. E. M. Hopkins was my assistant at Qurnah. When he went on leave to England Capt. 0. C. Mylles, M.C., was sent; but he, after a stay of a few months, was sent to Qahat Sikar. Finally, Lieut. C. C. C. Lewis, I.A., was sent as Shabanah Officer. He has helped me in much of the political work in addition to his duties with the Shabanahs. The Mudirs have all done good work. Shaikh Qubashi has been especially useful, while Ibrahim al ‘Amari has done extraordinarily well in a difficult position as Mudir of Bani Hutait. ‘Ati al Sa‘ad has improved very much at Hair, and now has the nahiyah well under control. My head revenue clerk, Tsa Effendi, has been of the greatest help to me. He is a tireless worker, and his great local knowledge has been found extremely useful. He is quite the most reliable man in my office. J. B. Mackie, Captain, Political Officer, Qurnah.APPENDIX A. Report, Medical and Sanitary, Civil Hospital and Population, Qurnah, January-December 1918. The number of out-patients attending the hospital during this period were well over 8,000. One may safely say that the number would have touched 10,000 had it not been for the following un avoidable reasons :—(a) Two months’ leave in India of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, and later the Civil Surgeon, (b) Absence of Sub-Assistant Surgeon for one month in Qal‘at Salih on special plague duty, (c) An interregnum of three weeks between the departure of one Sub-Assistant Surgeon and the appointment of his successor. The diseases that were chiefly treated in this department come under the following headings :— (a) Eye Diseases of all descriptions, and most of them hopelessly incurable from their chronicity. There are very few operable cataracts that would give a hope of restored vision. (b) Skin Diseases and Ulcers .—Venereal disease is well in evidence under this category. (c) Caries of Teeth .—The Arabs, from their habits of eating much sweet food, also their constant drinking of coffee and sweet tea, and disinclination to use some form of mouth toilet, are fast becoming a race of dyspeptics and ansemics, following on a large amount of dental caries and infective atematitis and gingivitis. It will be well to impress this and other lessons of personal cleanliness, and both house and compound sanitation, among the younger generation in the municipal schools. (d) Diseases of the Chest .—Bronchitis is common. Tubercular disease of the lungs is also a not infrequent occurrence and is usually pretty rapidly fatal. Byelaws as to expectoration on the floors of houses, coffee-shops, and places of meeting are very necessary. (e) Malaria .—At certain seasons is very common, usually the benign tertian form. There is very little fatality from it and it is not easy to find large spleens in the younger children. There is sallowness of complexion in those who live in the date-palm groves, where the mosquitoes breed out from the nullahs in great numbers. (f) Syphilis —It is fairly commonly seen, both the acquired and congenital forms. In consequence of the disastrous effect of this disease on the infant population it is necessary to consider at an early date the adoption of the most modern treatment for this disease and, as soon as supplies are available, to begin the intravenous inoculations of salvarsan or its substitutes. This alone, with mercurial after-treatment, holds out a hope of cure. (g) Leprosy is seen among those who come from the marshes and remoter riverain villages. A policy of segregation in industrial and farming colonies of their own should be adopted as in the British West and East African Protectorates. (h) Billharziasis is extremely common among the riverain populations of the Euphrates, and to a lesser extent on the Tigris and Swaib rivers. It is the cause of both acute and chronic ill-health and almost invariably the forerunner of “ vesical calculi.” Out of 70 male coolies from the Madinah district on the Euphrates working with the 27th Arab Labour Corps at Qurnah, the urines of 14 were taken without any selection at all, and, of these 12 were found heavily infected with the ova of this worm. There is thus well over 90 per cent, infection. This will be a matter for future preventive legislation. There has been an increased desire on the part of the population to ask for the Civil Surgeon or Sub-Assistant Surgeon to attend those who are very acutely sick m their homes. There has been much encouragement from some of the Shaikhs in this respect. Religious and social barriers still prevent us from attending their womenfolk to any extent. Operation Work .--Minor operations are of daily occurrence. Major operations include several amputations of legs following gangrene and shark-bites, abdominal section (for hydatid cj^sts) suprapubic cystotomy for vesical calculi, removal of cysts and tumours, resection for tubercular bone and joint disease. There is an increasing confidence evinced in the efficiency of surgical treatment. However ones cases must be well chosen and one must not experiment with obviously hopeless conditions’ 1 hope for more success as time goes on and when successful results are more published abroad The saddest cases are those gross lesions of the eye which are seen daily. There should be printed warnings in Arabic in every home on the dangers of the neglect of eye-inflammation. Infectious Diseases.—Small-pox is more or less endemic in the area, and one hears of sporadic cases here and there very frequently. In the Bani Mansur district they had several in the early and middle part of the year. Several hundreds of children were brought in by their parents for vaccination In Nuhairat we vaccinated about 500 children, and from MuzaiPah and Sharish and Shallah also several hundreds were brought for vaccination. Sharish and Shallah suffered from small nox in the spring time. 1 Qurnah itself had sporadic cases (three) in March, and during September eight cases were reported. Vaccination of the unprotected children and some adults was enforced. The town of Chabaish, near the entrance to Hammar Lake, was infected in the late summer months children 1 ^ quarantme - The Assistant Surgeon from the dredgers vaccinated several hundred During this year about 4,000 have been vaccinated in the area. Cholera. Two cases only among the civil population deaths from diarrhoea away in the marshes among Arabs cholera or dysentery. of Qurnah, one fatal. One heard of suspicious during the late summer. This may have been Plague. None in Qurnah nor its environments, as happened the year before. Qal‘at Salih had an epidemic in May and June of this year. This followed on plague in ‘Amarah There were over 20 cases, with 13 deaths. piague in Amaran -Influenza .—During the latter end of September, the months of October and November of this year, influenza was very rife in the district. As elsewhere, it was of a very severe type, several cases having the fatal pneumonic complication. The deaths in the district amounted to between 300 or 400. All possible medical aid and advice was given, but it spread with extraordinary rapidity and virulence in an unprotected soil. Death-rate and Birth-rate Statistics .—It has been impossible to gauge correctly the former until recently, as several cases, when severely ill, were taken out of the town before they died, and were buried outside without our knowledge. Such cases we shall be able to check now as there is a municipal register. Birth-rate. —This, in future, will become a very important branch of vital statistics. It will give us an idea of the infant mortality rate in the town, which one knows is considerable, but which was hidden from us, as the children are buried surreptitiously in the gardens. The necessity of a large virile Arab population is the burning question of Mesopotamia, and it will rest with the instructors in sanitation, whether medical or lay, to ensure a good healthy beginning and environment for the infant after birth. Sanitation.—The town is divided into three districts, each of which is supervised by an Arab sanitary havildar, under the instruction of the Civil Surgeon. In each district there are large open cane incinerators—six in all—to which the refuse of the compounds and streets is brought each day by donkey boys with their charges. The householders either carry their rubbish direct to the incinerators or empty it into refuse tins which are placed at advantageous points. This side of the sanitary problem is very satisfactorily carried out. The question of latrines is another tale. Those compounds which possess privies (in short, those inhabited by the rich) are quite sanitary, as these pits are very large and deep and have covered tops. These are practically septic tanks and sterilise themselves. The other compounds, which form the larger portion, require a very constant supervision, and, in some, finings are necessary before a proper state of affairs is reached. They were all supplied with latrine tins this year, which, after use, were to be covered with ashes and then carried to the nearest incinerators each day. Some carried out the orders, but others used the tins for culinary and other purposes, and deposited their excreta in any odd corner of the compound, where it afforded a happy resting place and breeding ground for iiies, and, besides being offensive, was a direct means of spreading disease by the fly carriers passing from faecal matter on to the food. The making of privies in every compound has been encouraged and in some cases, such as the milk purveyor’s compound, taken in hand and made by the sanitary section attached to the Qurnah area. It has been found that public latrines are quite hopeless in Qurnah. They were only used by a few odd boys and men, and the problem of the compound latrines still remained and remains acute, for the women and girls and most of the men just act as they always have done. I should suggest to the Political Authorities that the construction of privies in each compound be made compulsory during the next year. a u + i The problem of sweepers among the Arabs is an extraordinarily difficult one, as the Arab takes very unkindly to this work, there being no sweeper caste among them. At present the municipal incinerator work is done by Indian sweepers of the Expeditionary Force, and I do not know what will happen on complete demobilisation. The work at present is being done very efficiently, and there are some Arab understudies, who come whenever they like, and disappear when they hke, sometimes for days on end. I can only suggest that work of this prime importance should be paid well, so as to be attractive. Let the pay be at least equivalent to that of an adult Arab coolie, with a bonus each month for good work. Supervision of the municipal milk supply, the municipal slaughter-house and butchers shops and coffee-houses is close, and there is a regular spraying of these premises. The butchers shops and slaughter-house slabs are sprayed daily. The milk is kept in properly covered tins. In connection with shops, especially those which purvey food, I should suggest that gauze cloths be spread over these wares to keep away numerous flies and hornets. The butchers shops sell out their meat so quickly that these precautions are hardly necessary. Cqffee-shops have their water supply frequentlv inspected, and all the refuse is swept into refuse tins twice daily. There; are two municipal soda-water factories, with modern machinery and chlorinated water laid on. The tanks and cisterns are kept scrupulously clean. It was insisted upon m the first instance that if these factories were allowed to be put up they should have the advantage of the best water supply drainage, lighting, and structural completeness. Under sanction from the Military authorities the work was done by “ E ” and “ M ” sections. The beverages are sold only to die Arab population. The sanitation of the school (boys and girls) is also watched, and spraying each morning at 8 a.m. will become the rule. In addition the latrines are supervised. These are privies. The Shabanah Police force is a problem presenting a little more difficulty as these men are country born largely and recruited from villages where such a thing as modern sanitation is unknown. Object lessons, with an exercise of patience, are helping us among these rather elementary people. Street Drainaae.—This for surface rain water is accomplished by means of the central channel and proves for the most part satisfactory, where there is sufficient fall The main river front street through Qurnah north to south is very well metalled with broken brick and is standing weather and wear very well The roofing-in of the bazaar and the building of public baths, efficient street lighting, with the erection of more booths in the meat, fish, and the odd hawker market-places, are questions which need taking in hand. Dunn' the year electric light and fans were placed in the Civil Hospital and much appreciated by both patients and Sub-Assistant Surgeon. The departure of units from the town has released certain civil billets and areas for Arab re-occupation. A proper supervision is necessary to see that in rebuilding no overcrowding of new huts be allowed. Y 4312 +i^ S re ? ardR wa ^ er s^PPly&gt; as soon as piping is available T should advise the setting up of standpipes a 1 through the town so that clean sterilised chlorinated water may be drunk and so diminish the risk or dysentery, cholera and other water-borne diseases. This could be done at very reasonable cost. It is on the younger generation now being educated that we depend for future sanitary cleanliness. Lhe old prejudices must go and it is up to Muhammadanism, which is often stated to be inimical to free democratic principles, to prove the contrary in the evolution of this country. (Signed) L.

I spent nearly three months in ‘Amarah, from the middle of July to early in October, and returned on 23rd December. I found on my return that the officiating Political Officers had not themselves taken any steps to write up the year or collect figures, and that the Assistant Political Officer, QaPat Salih, had left for leave in England without leaving a solitary sentence or note or figure of any description which could be of service to me for the compilation of a report (independently of his last Monthly Report, to which I have referred in the list of my reports, and which furnishes the only available comment on the district). The Assistant Political Officer, ‘Ali Gharbi, furnished his report about 1st January, and the Assistant Political Officer, ‘Amarah district, and the Assistant Political Officer, Town, sent theirs about the same time. In all cases these reports are lacking in detail and in careful study of conditions and possibilities. I found it impossible to move from ‘Amarah and visit ‘Ali Gharbi and Qal‘at Salih owing to the number of legacies which had been left to me to settle. Moreover, the Judicial Officer had left, and I found myself saddled with a number of criminal cases, some of them of first-class importance, which could normally have been referred to the local court, had it been in existence. In addition, I was faced with the necessity of preparing a budget estimate in time for it to reach Baghdad by 20th January. The result is that I have not been able to do more than supply a few general comments on the tribes and their shaikhs and incorporate in the body of the Report the remarks of the Assistant Political Officers on details. These details are mostly inadequate, but I am unable to offer comments on them because I have never seen the districts. Further, Major Warburton asked the various departments, which, though Military, concern civil activities intimately, for reports; but their reports have not yet arrived, with the exception of one from the District Irrigation Officer, which has arrived too late for me to make use of it. The report of the District Irrigation Officer is accompanied by maps of such great interest that I feel it my duty to add a few words on the department’s work. Hence I have added as an Appendix a further note on irrigation and agriculture. R. Marks, Captain, Political Officer and Military Governor, ‘Amarah.

It will be seen that Division and Districts, more especially the ‘Ali Gharbi district, have suffered many changes, and if they have changed into something strange and new, there would have been sufficient excuse. But we have good friends among the Shaikhs and their staunchness has not diminished under the strain of adapting themselves to changing temperaments. The Shaikhs of the ‘Amarah Division are an unusually reasonable lot, and the Division generally has rendered signal services to the Government in the shape of supplies and orderly behaviour. The system of joint responsibility for thefts introduced by Major Mackenzie in May 1917, has worked well, and few thefts, of any significance have occurred. The roads have been secure to travellers and traders, and tribal fighting may be said to have ceased. Petty thefts there will always be so long as the ‘Amarah tribes harbour offshoots or outcasts of the Hai, and so long as the marsh Arabs exist on their borders. The scheme of joint responsibility has induced Shaikhs to practise some control over their criminal elements, while Captain Hedgecock’s admirable efforts at Qahat Salih have rendered the marsh Arabs of that district comparatively innocuous. In the ‘Ali Gharbi district the existing Muqata‘ah holders owe the British Government so much that they have conspired with us to control and almost stamp out marauding elements. One theft of considerable proportions may be recorded. A serious theft of 30 wooden sleepers from three railway culverts took place between Qal‘at Salih and Majar Kabir Canal in June 1918. With the sanction of the Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah, an amount of Rs. 5,000/- was recovered proportionately from Majid, Muhammad, ‘Usman and Falih as security pending further inquiries. From further inquiries it was quite clear that all the sleepers did not disappear in one night, but had been moved during the past three months, since the highest flood, either by thieves or “ acts of God,” the rapidly rising floods shifting the sleepers from their loose position under the culverts. Hence their absence was not detected till the waters subsided and the canals were reblocked (a few days before the discovery). As the thieves were never discovered, the security was converted into a fine.As regards the Qal at Salih district reference may be made to the Monthly Report up to September 1918 by the Assistant Political Officer as an interesting and valuable record of the first successful attempt to bring in the marsh Arabs. Azairij. At the beginning of the year Ziyarah was installed in ‘Audah and Shattaniyah. Though this move was bitterly resented by Shawwai and Salman, they accepted it with a fair grace. It is unfortunate that Ziyarah has lately resumed the character of a rake and consorted with dancing girls, who are hardly distinguishable from prostitutes, if at all. In December 1918 he was bold enough to take a “ theatre ” to his Muqata‘ah at the tails of the Butairah, to the amusement and disgust of all Shaikhs. 'Hie other Azairij Shaikhs, Shawwai and Salman, are good farmers, and, considering the tribe they have to control, deserve great credit for its comparative orderliness. Shawwai is the big man of the tribe. Albu dfWhzmmac?.—Muhammad al ‘Araibi has behaved consistently well as regards surrender of grain and payment of revenue. But he is himself a man of weak character and commands little respect. His agent, Mulla Muhsin, has the reputation of grinding the faces of the poor, but he is a strong man, and if forced to take the side of Government can induce Muhammad and his tribe to satisfy all Government demands. When it seemed that trouble might arise owing to the damming of the Chahalah, I officially recognised his position as Muhammad’s Mulla, knowing that he was capable of ruling the tribe with a strong hand and preventing any unseemly occurrence. Even if I had not done this, he was at any rate the true ruler of the tribe. He has been warned that any suspicion of mal practice on his part will lead to his expulsion altogether from the Muqata‘ah. Majid is a good farmer and keeps, his tribe in order. Laziness is probably his worst fault. On the whole he controlled his tribe well during the period when they feared great destruction to their crops owing to the damming of the Majar Canal. {Vide Report by the Political Officer for August and September for a comment on the damming of Majar.) Falih al Saihud, of the Qabat Salih district, remains the graceful and dignified figure he always was; and he remains, but with the added grace, a combination of strength and cunning worthy of his illustrious father. i Usman .—‘Usman could never be other than he is, a timid, colourless but crafty individual, requiring a strong hand to keep him ordinarily straight and compel him to keep his section of the Albu Muhammad in order. Tahir. —Tahir, the farmer of the Jurait Muqata‘ah, is not powerful enough to do harm, but he is also not good or wise enough to do good. Bani Lam .—In the ‘Ali Gharbi district, Juwi, Kamandar, and Abu Rishah have remained staunch friends. They tend to trade on their past services, but with a strong hand could be made to satisfy most requirements. They are extra ordinarily selfish and have not allowed others to share in their good fortune. Hence the problem of the so-called landless Shaikhs, though most of these have little claim to be considered potential farmers of Muqata‘ahs or Shaikhs. It is too much to expect that an Arab who is established by Government in sole possession of a large tract of land will voluntarily forgo one acre of it, except the sub-farmer accept a position of subordination under himself. In the ‘Amarah district Shabib has succeeded in keeping his tribe in order, and his history for this year is colourless. He is respected by the Bani Lam as the wisest of their Shaikhs, and his opinion is of great value in tribal disputes, if his own interests are not involved. Falih is a poor type, and it is fortunate that he has so little land to play with. Ghadhban. —Ghadhban’s pay has been increased from Rs. 1,000/-to Rs. 2,000/-, and he has been assigned the Duwairij muqata‘ah, with the following limits :— East —Thailah to Qabr-al-Saiyir to Ras-al-Kachah and Rushaidah to • Qabur-al- ‘Abtal to Fakkah ; W es t —Sadar-al-Karkhah to Abu Fujairah and Abu Miarish and Huwaitat and Al ‘Antariyah to Qabr Muktah; South —Hor Sinf of Musharrah, which is the end of ‘Awayah and Musa‘dah of Khor ‘Ubaid, on condition that he guarantees the safety of the rOads in his territory and ceases to take toll of travellers. Most of his time he has spent in Muhammarah. He has become in part a satellite of Shaikh Khaz‘al. He is in any case a much316 discredited and weakened power in the land. JBut his name is great, and he requires watching. His attachment to Shaikh Khaz‘al should keep him out oi mischief. His eldest son is in every way contemptible. Suwa‘ad. —The Shaikhs of this tribe are an orderly and peaceable lot. The best of them is Thamir, head of Bait Korjah. They all suffer from inroads made on the Musharrah Canal in flood time by the Tib and the Duwairij. Until these are dammed and diverted, they cannot hope to make anything of their muqata ahs. They certainly make the most of the material they have. But the Musharrah requires much digging. Sudan. —Saihud-al-‘Ajil has justified himself as Shaikh of the Sudan. He also is colourless. Albu Darraj. —This tribe is ruled by three bad Shaikhs, Mutashshar, Shia 6 and Shah ‘Ali. As there is no one in the tribe who could take their place, nothing can be done to improve its prospects. Mutashshar could not retain his position in place of competition. He has little control over his tribe, who, at the best of times, are a poor lot. Bahadil. —The appointment of Shaikh Kadhim-al-Sidqan to the Abu Hallanah muqata‘ah has been justified by results. It was not without considerable difficulty that I persuaded the various sections to settle their many blood feuds, and induced Harchan and Humud, son and agent of Hasan-al-Khafi, to bow to the decree which made Kadhim the responsible head of the tribe. As it is, neither Kadhim nor Humud has any real Bahadili following in the Muqata'ah. They sow mainly by means of foreign fallahs. But Kadhim has worked hard to satisfy the various Government demands and has been strong enough to enforce the various sections to obedience. He is inclined to tyranny and unjust exactions. But he has been a useful ally in controlling the many predatory elements in his district. Situated as he is on all sides of the perimeter on the right bank, he has had great responsibilities. A man of less strength would have found the task beyond his power. I append (Appendix A.) an account of the sections of tribes now settled in Abu Hallanah. The muqata‘ah is now well filled with cultivators, and it would be pointless to insist on Kadhim and Humud keeping to their agreement to bring Bahadilis to sow with them. Saiyid Hasan. —The Rumailah and ‘Ubaijah muqata‘ahs were under Saiyid Hasan until his death on 29th November 1918. I cannot but think my predecessor was right in objecting to the appointment of Saiyid Hasan. A Shaikh without a nose is an offensive object. He is now dead, and Saiyid Namuq has been appointed in his place. This appointment was not considered altogether just by other Shaikhs. However, by persuading Saiyid Namuq to give a third of his muqata'ah to Saiyid Mahmud and another third to Saiyid Humud on the understanding that Saiyid Namuq is the holder of the muqata'ah for Government purposes, not only has a certain appearance of injustice been dispelled, but the three Saiyids have gone away happy at last in a means of subsistence which is in accordance with their notions of personal dignity, and the Political Officer has ceased to be troubled by three of the most melancholy “ landless ” faces ever seen. One wonders whether Saiyid Hasan would have looked equally melancholy if he had possessed a nose. Boundary Dispute between Azairij Shaikhs. —The most interesting and difficult tribal dispute of the year has been over the boundary separating the Shattaniyah muqata‘ah from the territory of Shaikh Shawwai and Salman. The history of the boundary is as follows :— A sharatnamah of some 17 years ago places it at Duwaimah, a canal which forms the eastern limit of lands called Shati. Gradually the Azairij Shaikhs encroached on the Muntafiq elements, then in possession of ‘Audah and Shattaniyah, and secured a sharatnamah stating, at the dictation of Shawwai apparently, that Shati was in Shattaniyah. When Ziyarah was given the muqata'ah of 'Audah and Shattaniyah by my predecessor, he compromised the boundary problem by apportioning the Shati to Ziyarah and making a temporary boundary down the Sharmukhiyah and Abu Jassasin Canals, leaving to Shawwai the Jazrat and Abu ‘Aran. Unfortunately the Sharmukhiyah, shortly before it branches off into the Abu Jassasin, has to be bunded each year to prevent the water from overflooding the low-lying lands south of the bund, and at the same time to push back water into the higher lands of Shawwai. No definite arrangement was made as to the respective shares of work of the parties in this year’s bunding operation, thoughthe boundary cuts right through the centre of the bund, the difficulty being that the various sections are not of equal difficulty and to give half to one and half to the other party to bund would not be just. The result was bickering between the two sides and constant accusations of neglect by one party against the other. Yet the natural boundary must run through this bund and would give the Jazrat and Abu ‘Aran to Shaikh Ziyarah. Shawwai and Salman would bitterly resent this, and the friction caused this year by the lack of any definite order as regards the respective shares in the work of the two parties would be repeated, whatever orders were given. The matter may be easier of settlement now that Ziyarah has misbehaved himself in a way that would justify his being deprived of the Shati as a punishment and our putting back the Shattaniyah boundary to its old position at the Duwaimah Canal. This would end the trouble of the bund (known as Umm-al-Tuwaiyil). Ziyarah’s delinquencies consist in his selling the Karun wheat advanced to him for seed in the ‘Amarah bazaar to assist him to meet his more pressing debts. His debts are due to his relations with a certain dancing girl called ‘Atiyah, with whom he has contracted an immoral alliance. Careless of the “ Maradh Faring! ” which he has contracted, he has now taken her off, with her attendant pimps and with other dancing girls, to his muqata‘ah, where, I hear, performances are given for the delectation of the unsophisticated fallah at a rupee a man. Ziyarah has become a joke and a sore shame to the other Shaikhs and deserves, to my mind, the sharpest lesson. General [vide also Report of Political Officer for August and September 1918 and previous diaries by Political Officer and Assistant Political Officer).—It has helped us in war-time to retain single Shaikhs in large holdings, but there is no doubt that the muqata‘ahs are in many cases too large for a single farmer. This applies particularly to the holdings of Muhammad-al-‘Araibi, Majid, Juwi, and Abu Rishah. As, however, the various Shaikhs have consistently helped Govern ment, it is not yet the time to split up their holdings into various parts. Nor will it be easy when the time comes to effect such division. It will only be possible if we have been able to discover this, and that other Shaikhs or men of Shaikhly family who have a following and who by virtue of their following and in viev of their good fortune are able to detract from and counterbalance any foice which the former holder of the monopoly can bring to bear on the situation. But these are problems of the future, when the fate of the country has been decided and a settled administration, shared by the Shaikhs themselves, has come into being. Oj 16 thing is certain: if the Shaikhs were left to determine themselves, there would be no law save— “ The good old law, the simple plan That he should take who has the power, And he should keep who can.” Tribesmen, even Shaikhs, have a simple faith politically. They ^ realise the essential jealousy of each other and readiness to fight, and look to a ^ u j iuma , 1 ,, to sit in justice over their contentions, and they are content with such a hukumah if it is impartial and has a genuine interest in their welfare. They expect and respect strength in their governors. But they look also for good manners and a knowledge of their language. They will use to the full readiness to intrigue and corruption, md for the 5 moment appreciate it as something familiar and therefore in their element But they will not respect it, nor will they fear it, since it is a weapon familiar* to them. But they fear justice as a weapon, with whose use they are not acouainted and, on the principle “ omne ignotum pro magnifico,” respect it It is one of their theoretical virtues whose lack is pardoned m practice as a thing nprVmman though it figures in their stories in certain examplars as a practicable md desirable proposition. Wise and respectable Shaikhs will permit themselves to be bribed a £100 (not less) to cover a crime, but they will appreciate your acumen •md vour justice if you bring the criminal to book over their heads, granted you dfnoUn eriere with their £100. And if you interfere with the r £100, other we md resoectable Arabs who were not fortunate in this opportunity of being bribed, will ill the more respect your action because they can without apparent hypocrisy nraise it Such is the Arab, so far as the ‘Amarah Division goes, where the wisest of all its Shaikhs has lately perjured himself into a solemn assurance of the sound318 morals of an almost professional criminal to the tune of £100, though he had himself proclaimed the same criminal the worst of men before he accepted him as a sarkal. Yet with all their defects of morality Arab Shaikhs can remain astonishingly loyal. If Juwi’s muqata‘ah were divided into two parts, I think his loyalty would still stand. As Shabib said, when I commented on Juwi’s latest delinquencies: 44 Juwi will remain loyal to your Government ‘ilat tali ”— 44 to the end.” The following are extracts from the reports of the Assistant Political Officer, ‘Amarah, and Assistant Political Officer, 4 Ali Gharbi (For a report on the Qal 4 at Salih District reference may be made to the Assistant Political Officer’s report for the period ending 30th September 1918):— Extract from Report by the Assistant Political Officer, District 'Amarah. The District has been quiet and the tribes seem to have settled down to peaceful occupations and agriculture. There has been no violent crime, I know of, for the time I have held the post of Assistant Political Officer, namely, from the 3rd of September 1918, and there have not been any really hard cases to decide, from the point of view of the judicial acumen of that official. During the period under report, of which I have knowledge, there has only been one case of considerable theft. This occurred on a Resources hay-baling barge near Kumait, and was eventually settled by a fine of £T50, part of which went to compensate the people from whom Government clothing had been stolen. During September and October there were numerous petty thefts of Government stores off moving trains. This epidemic died down, four Shabanahs having been traced as the culprits. They were sentenced to five years each, but, unfortunately, escaped while en route to Basrah jail, and, so far, no trace has been found of them. The boundary dispute between Shaikh Shawwai of the Azairij tribe and Shaikh Ziyarah of the same still continues, but there is a chance of settlement now that things are on a more normal basis, and there is no present likelihood of a change in Political Officers. There was a strained period when the Majar Canal was dammed in September, but things were eventually restored to a stable footing. Nothing in the nature of a raid has occurred in the tribal districts, and caravans of goods to Persia and elsewhere have been able to go their way unmolested by robbers, and are a fruitful source of revenue to the Customs Department. The news of the end of the war has been everywhere received with quiet satisfaction, the peace parade in December being attended by almost every Shaikh of the ‘Amarah Division. Another event which greatly attracted the Arab was the agricultural show held at ‘Amarah in October. The proclamation of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief on the conclusion of the armistice with Turkey, and the world-shaking changes it foreshadowed, have been received with acclamation, and there is a sense of security everywhere and of better days in store. The visit of the Civil Commissioner by aeroplane in December and the document it resulted in, which was signed by all the important Shaikhs of this Division, is a token that they do not hunger after the old regime of the Turks in ‘Iraq. The institution of an oigamsed Shabanah force in the c Amarah Division is being well received, and promises well for the future and many recruits have been latterly coming in. The Police arrangements in the Baladiyahs are in good order, and, though they are not imposing, they undoubtedly help in keeping law and order in these places. The posts themselves are poorly-paid at present, and the cost of living somewhat high. In June, Hatim al Saihud, a former outlaw, asked for his “ safe conduct ” as he wanted to come in to the Government. This was granted, and he has since been continually visiting the authorities, on the look-out for some of his former power. (a) Inter-Tribal Relations—There is a certain degree of enmity between Shaikh Muhammad al ‘Araibi, Albu Muhammad, on the one hand, and Shaikhs Saihud al ‘Ajil, Sudan, and Tahir al Hatim, Albu Muhammad, on the other. Shaikh Falih a! Bunaiyah was of the latter party at one time, but his views have since changed. The origin of the enmity is, in my opinion, the fact that Muhammad al ‘Araibi will do nothing to help ‘Araibah, the mother of Tahir, financially. The reasonfor this is her disgraceful moral character. She was formerly a dependent of ‘Araibi. (b) Shaikh Mutashshar al Faisal, Albu Darraj, is very jealous of the way Shaikh Najm, of Kumait town, runs his District, and seems to be out to spoil the latter’s name in the eyes of the Government. He has tried this in several ways, viz., in the case of the theft on the hay-baling barge which was committed by one of the Albu Darraj in Najm’s territory. Shaikh Mutashshar seems to have also been associating with Shaikh Nasir, a bad man of the Muntafiq, who used to live in the muqata‘ah of Shaikh Kamandar, and has latterly come across to Mutashshar. (c) Shaikh Kadhim as Sidqan, Bahadil, is not on the best of terms with the Azairij. Possibly this may be due to a petty boundary dispute which I settled in the latter’s favour, making the Baduwiyah Canal the boundary between the Abu Hallanah and Azairij muqata’ah. He is playing up well with the supply of good men for Shabanah, and runs the muqata‘ah with great credit, considering it is such a difficult problem to face. Shaikh Kadhim should do well. (d) The Sawa'ad Shaikhs look after their lands in an exemplary way, and I was greatly struck by the neatness of the canal system during my tour of their muqata‘ah. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to reconcile the Bait Korjah Shaikhs, Thamir, Sadiq, ‘Ali, and Shabib. Thamir is the most suitable as a head to the house; and the contrast in the characters of the family is remarkable. Bait Zamil, headed by Musa, work together very well. (e) Shaikh Shabib al Mizban, Bani Lam, is very much perturbed at the prospect of having large numbers of troops camped on his land and wanted to absolve himself of all responsibility of thefts should they occur when the troops arrived. He seems to be getting somewhat feeble. (/) Shaikh Najm al ‘Abdullah is much respected as *an arbitrator by all the Shaikhs, and has been very useful to me on many occasions. (g) Shaikh Turki al ‘Afiat of Bughailah, Dur‘ai, shows great promise and is somewhat of a firebrand. He should be kept in mind for anything that may turn up. (h) Shaikh Shawwai, of the Azairij, is still a great enemy of Shaikh Ziyarah. The latter is ruining himself by his many and expensive “ amours,” which is a very great pity, as he has, but for this weakness, great energy and initiative. He is heavily in debt to several of the notables of ‘Amarah town. ( j) Shaikh Saihud al ‘Ajil, Sudan, although seeming to be a useful man, has not done much to help me when asked to do so. He seems to favour a policy of delaying things rather than doing things. (k) On the death of Saiyid Hasan, on the 16th December 1918, the Rumailah and ‘Ubaijah muqata‘ahs were divided between Saiyid Namuq, Saiyid Humud and Saiyid Mahmud, the first of the three being recognised as head. (l) Mulla Muhsin, the agent of Shaikh Muhammad al ‘Araibi, has done well in his post. He was the virtual head of the tribe at the time of the damming of the Chahalah, and kept them very well in hand. (m) Shaikh Ghadhban ibn Bunaiyah, Bani Lam, has been neglecting his tribes of late, having spent a long time with his friend Shaikh Khaz‘al of Muhammarah, in an extended tour to Kuwait and elsewhere. 1 Extracts from the Assistant Political Officer ‘AU Ghdrbrs, Report. ****** u Muqataahs and Shaikhs of l Ali Gharbi.—Alhc boundaries of this district and of the muqata‘ahs remain as described in last year’s report. There are only four muqata‘ah holders in this district, namely, Shaikhs Juwi, Kamandar, Abu Rishah and ‘Ubairah. ‘Ubairah, a boy under the guardianship of one Qu‘aiyid, succeeded his father Balasim in Ghuraibah when the latter died of galloping consumption in July last. This was arranged by the Deputy Civil Commissioner in ‘Amarah, at the 'request of the Bani Lam Shaikhs. Otherwise there have been no changes. There were no tribal disturbances throughout the year.“ Political Relations with Shaikhs .—On the whole relations with the Shaikhs have continued satisfactory, and there has been no real trouble with them. Abu Rishah has, however, a reputation for grinding the faces of the poor, while Juwi, whose dignified presence makes criticism seem indecorous, is perhaps not quite so innocent of al knowledge regarding certain happenings in his muqata‘ah as he would lead one to suppose. It took the Assistant Political Officer a month to extract a mare from him that had been stolen from one of his qolchis when on duty in his muqata’ah, Juwi’s own brother-in-law being strongly suspected of being the thief. “ There was also a scrap with a caravan a short time ago in which Juwi’s party had a mare shot, and the Kurds with the caravan had two of their number killed. As both parties were agreeable, this case was sent to Shaikh Najm of Kumait for settlement. The caravan routes will not be really safe until we have a few Shabanah posts out by the Persian border. “ The trouble is that with only four Shaikhs in the district, each with an ample muqata‘ah and with no real ill-feeling existing between them, they are able to form a ‘ combine ’ and arrive at complete agreement regarding the attitude they will assume towards the 1 hukumah ’ on any given question, thereby making it extremely difficult for any one outside to arrive at the real truth of things. “ As for the Shaikhs identifying themselves with the Government, as one would wish, I can see no prospect of it, excepting in so far as it suits their own ends. The dispossessed Shaikhs are always with us and spend as much time as they are permitted drinking coffee and pouring out the same old tale of woe in the Hakim al Siyasi’s office. “ Certain of them have grounds for asking that their claims may be considered sympathetically. Rut in any event I think they should no longer be left in doubt as to the manner in which Government is prepared to deal with them. “ There are more cultivators in the district than ever before, a fact that may be attributed to the Government’s policy of giving loans to Shaikhs, who in their turn are able to offer attractive advances to ‘Ashirahs. “ There have been very few cases of robbery amongst the tribes. Two or three Shabanah posts on the caravan routes to the Pusht-i-Kuh would be a boon to traders and would enable us to keep in touch with that large tract of country that lies between the river and the hills.” 32. Revenue : Land Revenue, 'Amafah .—There is, fortunately, little to say on this point. We were fortunate in good rains and the crops were everywhere good. The Assistant Director of Local Resources has been able to recover the 91 tons of wheat which were given to Shaikhs of ‘Amarah district on loan in 1917. In the Ali Gharbi district Ralasim lost considerably owing to a heavy hailstorm, but it is probable that he exaggerated his losses and sold considerable quantities to the Pusht-i-Kuh and Badrah districts. Mutashshar suffered considerably through the breach of the LJmaiyah bund. He was allowed a reduction on this account. Majid’s rice crop was materially affected by the damming of the Majar Canal. As compensation for his losses he has been allowed to retain the Jawwar muqata c ah for a further period and his revenue has been reduced by £T.4,000. All Shaikhs suffered to a certain extent by unusually heavy rains in November, which spoilt quantities of rice. The Shaikhs to whom the various muqata c ahs are farmed out are treated very generously and have no difficulty in paying their agricultural loans. The farming system affords an easy system of collection and probably saves in reduction of staff and the peace of the district as much as might be gained by a more direct system of management by Government. On the other hand it would put the sirkal and the fallah completely in the hands of the Shaikh if the Shaikh, fortunately, were not compelled to more or less just treatment by the independence of his fallahs, who, if they do not like a particular individual, can move to the seivice of another and do so. This is peculiarly the case with the 'Amarah Division owing to the familiarity of the tribes with each other. For instance, when the time comes to reap the rice, the threshers are not Albu Muhammad, but Rani Lam and other foreign tribes. And, again, the three or four big heads of the Albu Muhammad tribe compete against each other for fallahs. This competition explains the demand for agricultural loans which are to the Shaikhs an instrument whereby to attract fallahs in the shape of advances of ready cash. Below is an interesting estimate of the acreage of the Chahalah muqata‘ah, prepared by certain townsmen confidentially.“ Estimation of 1914 by the Turkish for paddy in the Chahalah district:— ‘Adil 10,000 ‘Aiwij - 7,000 Khur-al-Qahamah 2,500 Tala‘ah - - . 2,500 Ramahiyah 800 Dawawir - 1,200 Khur-al-Budair 300 Batul - - - 250 Umm-al-Tus 7,700- Government as to the area of land used ■Contain the following— Na‘na‘ah 500 Zalatah - - - 1,300 Umm-al-Hannah - 1,600 Massas - 1,700 Musfah - - - 1,500 Umm Tabiyah 300 Abu Sukhair - 800 7,700 Michairiyah ‘Asaichi - 9,700 As under— Manahyah - 2,000 Umm-al-Thuwaimat 500 Humairah - 600 Jarrayah - 3,000 Qattah - - 600 Tamamah - 200 A1 Mufaishij - 2,000 Sharmukh 800 9,700 Dhulaimah - - 1,000 Total - - - 43,250 qubalah = 20,000 acres (1 qubalah = ——— 2,228 sq. yards). One qubalah is 100 by 100 square yards (dhara‘ estimated 17 inches). Seed required for a qubalah is from 6 to 12 chailah, and estimated at 10 chailah per qubalah. One chailah equals 9 lbs.” The following is an estimate by the D.D.I., Tigris, of the amount of rice resulting from a normal crop of rice in the chief areas of cultivation in this district: Majar Chahalah - Musharrah Butairah - Michariyah 15.000 18.000 7.000 16,000 5.000 61,000 Put total at 55,000 as a conservative estimate. The yield of rice per acre is 1,400 lbs. or 5/8th of a ton (conservative estimate). The total yield at this rate would be about 35,000 tons. If Government share is l/5th, 7,200 tons can be expected as Government demand. ,, A reasonable average total yield for the Lower Tigris, including Qurnah, would Note that according to an estimate given m Turkish times (1914) the area in the Chahalah is 43,250 qubalas or 20,000 acres. One qubalah = 100 by 100 dhara 1 ; 1 dhara 1 X 17 inches. Say, 1 qubalah x 2,228 yards; 1 acre being 4,840 square yards.n 322 Report of Assistant Political Officer. “ (A) Land Revenue, ‘Amarah District. —The demands for the year ending 31st March 1919 amount to Rs. 12,61,990. Of this, Its. 7,42,088 has been collected to date. “ The collection of the same has not been attended with any difficulty, and the full collections will be realised when the Government demand of rice from the Shaikhs has been met. In fact, I consider that the Shaikhs especially have done well in surrendering so much cash, when they have had their markets closed to merchants owing to the Government demands of 12,000 tons from the ‘Amarah district. The collection of revenue in cash for shitwi crops was a trifle belated in some cases, notably those of Shaikhs Mutashshar and Tahir. Shabib and Najm paid up promptly, as also did Falih-al-Bunaiyah and Kadhim. “ The collection of paddy in kind from the Suwa‘ad Shaikhs is proceeding satisfactorily, their muqata‘ah being a revelation of what can be done by good management. “ (B) Opium Farm. —This has realised so far Rs. 2,816/-. There have been occasional cases of trying to avoid the rule that the contractor alone is allowed to sell, and in each case the opium has been confiscated and sold, the proceeds being credited to Government. “(C) Reeds and Mats. —This tax has brought in Rs. 40/- a month and the total now stands at Rs. 360/-. In addition to this, Rs. 542/- has been realised on ‘Amarah reeds and mats. “ (D) Kodak. —The demand for this is Rs. 71,350/- per year, and of this Rs. 44,718/- has been collected. The demand from each Shaikh seems fair, with the exception of £T. 1,000 from Muhammad-al-‘Araibi, which seems to me a trifle high, as he, being a rice Shaikh, has not a very large number of sheep. He tried to make up his payments by levying a tax of 10 annas on each sheep that came with the tribes to his land in ‘ shilb ’ time, irrespective of size. He tried to get out of the difficulty by calling this sum, ‘ shatt martah ’ or grazing tax. “ I eventually made him refund the money realised from his illegal exactions to the aggrieved parties, headed by Shaikhs Saihud and Tahir and the sheep contractor Rashid. The latter has done quite good work since.” From Report of Assistant Political Officer.

The Political323 Officer was unable to deal with the , tapu work himself and left the work to ‘Ali Elfendi, Mamur Tapu. As a result of which the tapu Mamur forwarded about 14 cases for approval to the Revenue Board, Basrah, up to end of June 1918. A notice was received from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, in June, forbidding persons other than Arabs of Mesopotamia to alienate immovable property situated within the occupied territories unless the previous sanction of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, or of some other person authorised by him on his behalf, had been obtained in writing. This notification was published accordingly. ‘Abbas Fadhli Effendi, Mustashar to the Revenue Board, was sent to ‘Amarah in August 1918 for preparation of a list of tapu transactions which had been carried through informally during the last three years, and for which formal sanction of the Army Commander was now required. He was put to work under Major Warburton, who was then supervising the tapu work in addition to his duties as District Judge, ‘Amarah. The following is a list of documents of transfer of immovable property not registered in the Tapu Department, but attested by the Political Officer, Assistant Political Officer, and Military Governor :— Year. Sales. Sales by Mohammedans to Jews. Others. Total. 1915 to 1916 - 89 21 63 173 1915 to 1917 - 94 11 47 152 1915 to 1918. - 4 1 — 5 330 On August 5th 1918 the following notice was issued :— “ Between the months of October 1915 and March 1918 there have been nearly 350 cases of immovable property which were registered in the presence of the Military Governor or his deputy at ‘Amarah. Any person who has any objection to any of these cases should give a petition to the Tapu Mamur at ‘Amarah or the Tapu at Basrah declaring his objection before 20th August, and after 20th August the Tapu Department will not listen to any objections.” The legacy of “ Tapu Officer ” was handed over to Capt. Rivett Carnac (Assistant Political Office district) by Major Warburton, on his departure to Tehran on duty. The work involved is exceedingly intricate. Having no time to attend to it properly he has represented the necessity of a special mamur for this work, which is considerable, and trusts that his amateur efforts at overcoming the difficulties have not as yet been attended by great loss to the State. The question of Tapu is of great importance, and he has not yet touched the Tapu Sanads appertaining to Tapu lands in muqata‘ah areas. There is a considerable amount of this type of land in Abu Hallanah muqata‘ah for example. The estab lishment of a Tapu Department, is of great importance from a Revenue point of view, and, so far, the Tapu registration fees have realised the sum of Rs. 15,022/-. (c) Waqf. —There is nothing of interest to report under this head. (d) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues. —Under this heading are included the following :— (A) ‘Araq Farm —The demand was Rs. 21,500/-. Of this, Rs. 16,125/- has so far been realised. This is a paying concern, and there does not seem to be any necessity for starting an ‘araq distillery in ‘Amarah. Liquor is sold at 5s. 8J. a bottle, and requirements for ‘Amarah can be supplied either from Basrah or from Kut, if the Basrah supply fails. (B) Fish Farm. —This was farmed out for Rs. 11,600/- for the year, and so far has brought in Rs. 8,694/-. (C) Salt Revenue.— This has brought in Rs. 2,021/- so far, and the supply in the Government anbar is adequate at present. There is not any very great demand for this commodity in ‘Amarah. (D) Foreign Liquor. —Foreign liquor licences bring in Rs. 50/- a month, there being one shop in Amarah selling the same.324 (E) Fishing Licences amount to Rs. 52/- and Tobacco Licences have so far produced Rs. 1,870/-. Spedal Revenues, ‘Ali Gharbi. —Special revenue receipts amount to Rs. 9,490/7, a drop of Rs. 3,000/- on last year’s receipts. This was chiefly due to the vegetable tax bringing in only Rs. 1,377/— as against Rs. 5,500/— the year before. It should be mentioned, however, that the person who bought the right to collect the tax last year lost heavily over the transaction, and consequently no one would bid for it this year. The sheep tax also declined from Rs. 3,600/- to Rs. 1,600/-. In passage fees Rs. 4,882/8 were received. There is no liquor tax as there are no liquor shops in this district, the majlis, which included a Jew, being dead against their introduction. (e) Customs (‘Amarah). —Sums amounting to Rs. 37,169/- have been collected in customs duty and on post parcels. Some Rs. 17,727 of the total is on parcels, and this latter brought in on an average Rs. 3,599/- a month till May, when facilities ceased. This when reopened will be a good source of revenue to Government. The average monthly sum realised in customs amounted to Rs. 2,500/-. There was very little attempted smuggling of goods into ‘Amarah to avoid customs duty, and in the cases where this was found out, double and sometimes triple duty was charged. Customs at ‘Ali Gharbi. —Customs dues amounted to Rs. 16,501/- or Rs. 3,300/- less than last year. This decline in receipts may be attributed to the more settled state of the country, allowing the caravans from Persia to traverse other routes to Kut, Baghdad, and ‘Amarah; also to the amount of sickness there has been in the Pusht-i-Kuh of late. The chief imports are wool, carpets, tobacco, tents, silk, and opium. (f) Compensation of 'Amarah (Town). —During the past few months the Govern ment has unavoidably taken over many houses and compounds belonging to civilians. Houses, walls, and date-palms have been demolished to make room for Government buildings and in many cases no records were kept as to damage done and the value thereof. There are at present 15 such cases of long standing, some of which date back to the occupation of ‘Amarah, in which very few previous records are traceable; but this matter has been referred to the General Headquarters and should be settled shortly. Two cases which had been outstanding since 1917 have been successfully settled. There still remain, however, a^ very large number of cases in which the claimants have not, up to the present, applied for compensation, and the formation of an Assessment Board has been suggested, with a British officer as President, who could make it their special work to go into such matters. It would, however, be a big task and would probably extend over at least two months. 3. Irrigation.— There were two measures urgently required which have not yet passed into effect, irrespective of schemes which would secure extended irrigation outside the present limits. One is the deepening of the Musharrah Canal, which requires the aid of a mechanical dredger, hitherto unobtainable. And the other is the deepening of the Mudailil Canal, not impracticable even without a mechanical dredger, but difficult to accomplish owing to scarcity of fallahs, along with attendant works such as a protective bund along the edge of the Dujailah Canal to guard against possible floods due to breaches higher up the river. In the latter case an effort was made to dig the canal by means of Arabs, but as Shaikh Mutashshar could only produce 100 men, instead of the 1,000 demanded, this work had to be abandoned. Late in the year, in September, sanction was accorded to a scheme for damming the Duwairij and diverting its waters into the Shatt-al-A‘mah. This work had to be abandoned for lack of labour. The same applies to a promising scheme proposed by the D.D.I., Tigris, for diverting the waters of the Tib from its inroads on the Nahar Sa‘ad by means of a protective bund. At the time the scheme might have been put into execution no labour was available. It may be observed, for the information of those who have charge of irrigation projects, that from September to December all tribesmen flock to the rice districts to assist in reaping and threshing, and the country is thus denuded of labour. It would be unfair to prevent this efflux of potential labour because, for generations, poor cultivators have looked to the rice-reaping season for a chance of earning theirsubsistence for the ensuing year, each man taking as a reward a certain quantity of rice, without which he would be compelled to buy in the towm markets. At other times of the year the fallah is well occupied with the cultivation of wheat and barley, except during the fertilising season for rice from June to September, when the heat is such as to make strenuous outdoor manual labour almost impossible. The conclusion seems to be that, if anything is to be done to extend or improve irrigation, either foreign cultivators must be introduced or we must place reliance on mechanical assistance. The latter seems the obvious solution. In the ‘Ali Gharbi district the Irrigation Department has undertaken the building of a regulator at Musandaq. A regulator, having two openings of one metre each, is being built for the purpose of letting water into the Musandaq depression. When this is completed “ shitwi ” crops will be assured in the area commanded and it may even be possible to cultivate saifi there. This is the only irrigation work which has been found practicable this year. But it is no fault of the Irrigation Department that considerable areas of fertile soil have not been brought under cultivation by means of new works. Lack of labour remains the constant cry throughout Mesopotamia—more especially in war-time, when all pressed labour is used for Military works. The Irrigation Department might have paid more attention to the effect of * the damming of the Majar Canal on the rice crops. It is evident now that if certain obvious works had been carried out to raise the level of the water by a series of hamals in the Majar Canal and insisted on a careful damming of the tails of the ‘Adil and the Wadiyah, much of the rice lost through conservancy operations might have been saved. For an account of the trouble over the Majar dam please see Diary by the Political Officer, ‘Amarah, for August and September 1918. It has been suggested by the D.D.I., Tigris, that the remedy for the problem of keeping the Tigris navigable and at the same time encouraging, or at least not interfering with, irrigation is to close the Majar altogether, and take off a new canal from the Butairah, which should be directed towards the Majar, but from and at a higher level, and thus ensure cultivation on the upper canals of the Majar without damage to the rice fields at the tails of the canal. It would be difficult to persuade Shaikh Majid that such a scheme is to his advantage, but that is no objection to the scheme from a theoretical point of view. 4. Agriculture. —Plenty of early rain has fallen, which has damaged the rice crops to a considerable extent, but benefitted the land for wheat and barley. A large acreage has been ploughed and this should ensure a good wheat and barley crop next year. Floods have been very bad in some parts, more notably in the lower reaches of the Butairah Canal. Shaikh Ziyarah-al-Mahi, of the Azairij, seems to have been the chief sufferer. Shaikh Tahir-al-Hatim, of the Albu Muhammad, has been allowed to let his land lie fallow this year, as is his custom once every five years. The vegetable crop of ‘Amarah seems to have been a bumper one, and there has been no lack of the same for the troops and population alike. The tribesmen do not seem to have been very keen on buying Karun wheat, the price being somewhat high, and they being suspicious of the results of planting the same, having had no luck with the Indian wheat issued to them last year. The rainfalT in the beginning of 1918 was excellent and this resulted in an excellent barley harvest. . The high river and late rain also produced a bumper rice crop. Ibis promised excellent results, but the abnormal rainfall in the autumn somewhat spoiled the promise of summer. The rains in the month of December have been timely and acceptable and the fallahin are to be seen everywhere busily engaged ploughing the land. Aqricultural Loans at ‘Ali Gharbi. —Last year’s loans in cash and grain were recovered in full, and the following amounts have now been advanced to the Shaikhs for the coming season’s cultivation : Shaikh Juwi - - ' “ - Fs. j^OO/- Shaikh Kamandar - - - - ” aaa/ Shaikh Abu Rishah - - ' ” o’aaa/ Shaikh ‘Ubairah - - - “ ” b,000/ 5 Municipality : ‘Amarah (Town) : Licences.—DuAng the early part of the year apparently no record was kept of the issue of licences to shopkeepers, coffee-326 shop owners, hawkers, &amp;c., except the counterfoil of the receipt slip for the fee paid. Now, however, a register has been commenced showing all particulars of owner and commodity offered for sale by him, and proper licence forms, printed and completed in English and in Arabic, have been issued. The vast majority of the old receipts slips (which served for licences) have now been called in and the first week in January should see the re-issue completed. Removal of Restrictions.—The effect of this measure has been indubitably great as is obvious from the plentiful supply of meat, grain, &amp;c., in the municipality, and also from the large number of mahailahs banked in near the bazaar conveying merchandise. Of the approximate number of refugees, 1,100, who have been located in ‘Amarah, already nearly all have been shipped to Baghdad and the remaining few will be taken there during the next few days. __The urgently needed repairs which were sanctioned some two months ago are now in process of construction. The result will be increased accommodation, security and sanitation. There are at present 12 convicts, 12 on remand and three civil debtors. These are employed partly in assisting with the work in the jail, and partly on municipal roads, where their work makes one realise what could be done w^ere a whole labour corps available. October marked the inauguration of a new feeding system. Hitherto a native contractor had supplied the convicts with food; but under the new arrangements the Deputy Superintendent now purchases the supplies from the bazaar. The installation of an oil-cooker has also been a distinct improvement and a saving of 25 per cent, has been effected. Census. —This is in course of operation at the present moment, and should be completed by the 7th January 1919. Oil. —During the latter part of the year, a new system of distribution of oil to the civilian population has been introduced. This has not been working long enough yet to enable us to judge its merits or otherwise. The supply of kerosene oil is not sufficient for the needs of the civilians, although an extra 3,000 gallons were obtained from the Inland Water Transport during December. The total supply is now 15,000 gallons per month. It is hoped in the near future, when transport difficulties are less pressing, to procure a further increase from the Assistant Director, Inland Water Transport. Kerosene.oil is now obtainable by the consumer at the following rates :— Four gallons (one tin) ----- R s . 4/4/- Per one gallon - - - - - - „ 1/2/- Per whiskey bottle - - - - - ,, 3/6 These rates seem to afford satisfaction to all concerned. Municipality at ‘Ali Gharbi.—The establishment consists of a mukhtar, a sanitary inspector, a chaush, and 12 sweepers. The expenditure for the year is Rs. 5,087/- and the income Rs. 13,045/-, leaving nearly Rs. 8,000/- surplus, out of which Rs. 5,000/- is to be contributed towards the cost of the river wall. The municipal income is derived from the following sources :— Ferry tax ------ p s . 4,000/- Slaughter tax - - - - - „ 1,900/- Shops, house, and hawkers’ taxes - - - 6,155/- Landing stage tax - - - - „ 1,090/- Total - - R S . 13,945/- Shaikh Sa‘ad Municipality .—Shaikh Sa‘ad became a Baladiyah last June. The establishment consists of a Rais-al-Baladiyah, a clerk, and four sweepers. The monthly expenditure averages Rs. 16/-, while the monthly income is only about Rs. 100/- derived from the ferry tax. A grant-in-aid from Government of Rs. 5,000/- enables the excess expenditure to be met. As the town is rapidly increasing in size and property it is proposed to introduce a house tax and thus make the village self-supporting. [Jp ‘'Ali Gharbi River Wall. Arrangements for building this were commenced late in the low-water season, so that it has been a rush to keep the work abovewater level. Unfortunately the Shaikhs let us down badly on the carriage of bricks from Sarut to the river bank for loading into mahailahs. There is no doubt that, had they not done so, the wall could have been completed without much trouble. As it is, the foundations are completed and the wall raised some six feet, so that only the easy part remains to be done, but the supply of bricks having been cut off and the river having risen covering the work, no further progress can be made at present. The cost of the wall is estimated at Rs. 30,000/-, to be raised as follows:— (1) Loan from Government (2) From municipal funds - - - (3) Landing stage tax doubled for one year (4) From Maude Memorial funds - Rs. 17,000/- „ 5,000/- „ L000/- „ 7,000/- Total Rs. 30,000/- 6. Judicial : ‘Amarah Town. —Major H. Warburton, District Judge, Law Courts, ‘Amarah, on his sudden departure to Tehran on duty, left his office to the Assistant Political Officer (Town). From a perusal of registers in his office numbers of cases were known as follows Settled. Unsettled. Total. (1) Civil suits - 10 34 47 (2) Criminal cases - 71 1 72 (3) Small cause cases, or pending. 274 in total. No remarks given whether settled Judicial Work at ‘Ali Gharbi. —In the village there is practically no crime, and any that there is, is of a very insignificant description. The ‘Ali Gharbi majlis has worked very well in settling petty cases about debts and other small disputes. 7. Education. —Lack of accommodation has made it impossible to open a Government school. There was a fine school building in ‘Amarah, but that has been occupied by the Military. The existent schools :— (a) Jewish School, (b) Muhammadan School, (c) Chaldean School, have carried on and have been assisted by grants-in-aid to the following extent. Jewish School - H s * UO/ - Muhammadan School - - ' ” 50/— Chaldean School - - - ' ” 30/- Arrangements are now almost complete for the opening of the Maude Memorial School in a temporary building. It is, perhaps, not a misfortune that Government has been able to do‘so little for education hitherto, as many principles have got to be approved which can only be judged in their practical application by the light Capt H. E. Bowman, Director of Education, visited ‘Amarah on 20th December 1918. A meeting of the Municipal Committee at the Political Office, Amarah, was held the same date. It was agreed that the building of such school should be postponed for six months or a year, when the cost of materials and construction will have diminished. At the request of certain members of the Committee it was explained that the policy of Government with regard to education is that the Maude Memorial School, like all Government schools will be open to all denomina tions, and special arrangements may have to be made with regard to the religious instructions of the non-Moslems. Education at ‘Ali Gharbi.—At ‘Ali Gharbi a maktab was opened last June. There are 92 scholars, of which 34 are Kurds, 32 Arabs, and 26 Jews. _ Teaching staff consists of one headmaster and two assistants. The school is working satisfactorily, but there is room for improvement. Education at QaVat Salih.—A school was opened at Qal at Salih in June 1917. There are at present 90 boys, of whom 44 are Moslems, 45 Sabeans and one Jew. Teaching staff consists of one headmaster and three assistants. The building is indifferent and can only be regarded as a makeshift until the Maude Memorial Scho^T C^rectecf C meeting of the Municipal Committee was held when the Z 4328 Director of Education visited QaPat Salih on 21st December 1918, and it was agreed to postpone the building of the school for six months or a year, when the cost of the materials, &amp;c., will, it is hoped, have been reduced. The site already selected, at the south end of the town, is Government property, and no expenditure will therefore be incurred beyond the actual construction. 8. Medical and Sanitation : ‘Amarah Town .—The present Medical Officer of the Town, Capt. P. A. With, R.A.M.C., has done much in the town, both by his work at the Civil Hospital and Dispensary and during the late outbreak of cholera and plague. An outbreak of the latter manifested itself in May, causing altogether 518 deaths. An isolation hospital wns at once formed, and the majority of the townspeople were inoculated. A pleasing feature is that this latter was done at the special request of the majlis. By special permission a set of presents of ‘Amarah silver work were given to the sisters who did such noble work in inoculating natives of ‘Amarah against plague, accompanied by a suitable letter expressing the admiration and gratitude of the town for their services. During the month of June the death-rate dropped considerably, while since July no further cases have occurred. An epidemic of small-pox occurred in September, but was brought under control by the end of November. This was responsible for 109 deaths in all. Sanitation .—During May last sanction was obtained for 10 extra coolies for sanitary work in addition to the permanent establishmnet, but these were subse quently taken away owing to labour shortage. There are now 14 coolies working on latrines, and all, except four Indian sweepers, have been returned to Military duty. Six public cesspits have been constructed in the place of public latrines and incinerators, and these have proved their value. A sanitary tramline erected in the town has proved of great use, but difficulty has been experienced in removing the kith, &amp;c., from the municipal slaughter-house, since the Military have, during the past year, been unable to supply any Crowley cart wheels. A comprehensive drainage scheme is needed. Proposals were made by the A.D. Works, but w r ere not recommended by the A.D. medical service or by the Deputy Director Works, Civil, Basrah. ‘Ali Gharbi .—Please see Appendix B., Report by Civil Surgeon, ‘Ali Gharbi. 9. Police : ^Amarah Town .—The establishment of the Civil Police in the municipality is as follows :— Designation. Sanctioned Strength. Actual Strength. Vacant. Inspector - - - - - _ 1 1 Sub-Inspector - - 2 1 1 Clerks ----- - - 5 3 2 Head Constables - - - 12 12 — M. Head Constable - - 1 1 — Ordinary Constables - - 111 103 8 Sowars - - - - - - 2 2 — Mamurs - - - - ' 4 4 Crime has sprung from three sources :— (1) External Arabs. (2) Indian criminals. (3) Ordinary or petty. (1) This is mainly due to lack of an effectual system of information from outside areas and loss of time in reporting when crime has been committed. (2) This is caused mainly by escaped Indian criminals. A recent case in point is as follows:—An Indian criminal, Veeru, whose robberies in ‘Amarah alone amount to the value of Rs. 10,000/-. He has twice been convicted, and has each time escaped from Military custody. This man is still at large. Until Indians recruited from jails and from criminal tribes are removed, this sort of thing will continue.(3) This has assumed quite small proportions in the past year and consists mainly of petty larceny and street rows, &amp;c. Police at ‘Ali Gharbi .—At ‘Ali Gharbi there are one chaush, one onbashi, and nine policemen, and at Shaikh Sa‘ad one chaush and three policemen. They discharge their duties, which are light, satisfactorily. 10. Shabanahs. —In the course of the year many posts have been taken over by Shabanahs. In the first place considerable stretches of the railway have been guarded and patrolled by these irregular police, and a long stretch of river frontage. Out of the old railway patrols and river police have sprung the Shabanah force of the ‘Amarah Division, which now has a strength of 424 rifles. In September it was decided to relieve all but the important central Military posts like ‘Amarah and ‘Ali Gharbi by locally enlisted men. The first steps had already been taken in the Qal‘at Salih area. Afterwards it was decided to take over all marching posts and enrol all men employed by the various Military depart ments, such as Agriculture and Resources, in an organised force under the authority of the Civil Commissioner or his local representatives. This was effected in October. The difficulties were great. The Shaikhs feared that their men were to be impressed into regular Military service, and when asked for Shabanahs, sent their oldest men. I have seen one man sent to a post as a Shabanah who must have been at least 80 years of age. But it did not take long to overcome the fear of conscription, and when this fear ceased to exist the men began to take a pride in themselves and did well. It is clear that the Shabanahs are useless without the goodwill of their Shaikhs, and we depend ultimately on the Shaikhs for the security of posts where six Shabanahs take over what was originally guarded by a company or half a company of soldiers. Nevertheless the Shabanahs, if they can be encouraged to some keenness in their profession and persuaded to operate in districts away from their own particular tribes and with other Shabanahs of other tribes, may help to weaken the obstinacy of tribal distinctions as well as the power of their own particular tribes. They may, therefore, become an important political weapon. They should form the nucleus of a future Arab army. 11. Labour. —The ‘Amarah district is well populated, but as it is also richly cultivated there is not sufficient surplus labour to carry out new and extensive schemes of irrigation. Nor is it so disposed at different seasons of the year as to be available for work at the right time. Military exigencies have necessitated the levy of a forced labour corps of tribesmen, amounting normally to some 1,300 men. Every man means the loss of a number of tons to crops. But the war has made this inevitable and the Division is rich enough to stand it. ^ # The difficulty has been greatest for the past year in the Ali Gharbi district, which owing to the ravages of war and the proximity of the enemy, has been sparsely populated. Towards the end of the year considerable sums were sanctioned in the shape of agricultural loans and the Shaikhs have thus been able to attract more fallahs than the district has seen for some time. As regards labour recruited from the town of Amarah,^ the numbers have dropped materially since an order was issued forbidding habitation in sareefahs, except in the case of Police and farrashes employed by Government During the last months very little labour has been available for work m the municipality, with a result that the roads and drains are still m a very bad state of repair, accentuated by the extremely heavy and early rams of a month ago At present all available labour is commandeered by the Military (Labour Bureau) for other and possibly more important work. This remains an obstacle to the undertaking of work on any large scale. Frequently it has been necessary to suspend the granting of building passes to civilians for periods of weeks at a time owing to every available coolie being required by the Labour Directorate This has militated against the successful solution of the housing problem and also has prevented the town from being kept in that good state of repair which is desired by both Military and civil authorities. Labour at ‘Ali Gharbi.-The demands for labour by the Military authorities have been increasing very much of late. At present there are roughly about 500 men sunolied from the tribes. In order to release labour for cultivation 230 p“fsoners of war are to be sent to ‘Ali Gharbi. When they arrive, all further complaints under this head should cease.330 12. Miscellaneous. —At the beginning of the year orders came from Baghdad to arrest and deport certain individuals who had been proved by captured corre spondence to be in regular communication with the enemy. The result of these deportations was that the Mohammadan Poor Relief Fund fell into abeyance. An effort has been made to engage the sympathy of the original supporters in a continu ance of this work. The names of the deportees are as follows, and include both townsmen and tribesmen :— (1) Ahmad al Mustafa, Chalabi. (2) ‘Abdul Wahab, Chalabi s/o Shaikh Latif. (3) Saiyid Salih Samirli. (4) Malik s/o H. ‘Abdul Qasim. (5) Haji Taha Chalabi. (6) ‘Abdullah Effendi s/o ‘Abdul Salam al ‘Adhmi. (7) Saiyid Ibrahim s/o Yusuf. (8) Haji Salman as Sidqan. (9) Muhammad s/o Shaikh Daud. (10) ‘Abdul Razzaq s/o Shaikh Latif. (11) Hidayat Effendi. (12) Khudhaiyir s/o Mulla Farman. (13) ‘Ali al Shaikh. (14) Saiyid Rasmi (or Rasan). (15) Ismahl al Mahmud. (16) Mustafa Agha Chakmakji. (17) Habib al Shati. (18) Muhammad Salim Effendi. Agricultural Show. —The local products section of the show was organised through the Deputy Military Governor’s office and was, together with the races, an event of outstanding interest. Rs. 1,400 were taken in gate money on the first day at annas 8 per head. Much credit is due to Capt. Pearson, D.M.G., for the admirable way in which he ran this section of the show. Those civilian exhibitors who received prizes were as pleased as they were surprised, since, in spite of repeated explanations, they had only the haziest idea of the meaning of a show. Another year it is possible that a proposed show would meet with a much more enthusiastic welcome, and would therefore become, from the exhibit point of view, infinitely more successful. Proclamation Parade. —This was remarkable as being an occasion on which the largest concourse of ‘Amarah townspeople assembled since the occupation. The conclusion of the Arabic translation of the G.O.C.’s Proclamation was greeted by three spontaneous cheers, and there is no doubt but that all present were greatly impressed with the ceremony, and satisfied at this official reognition of the conclusion of hostilities. The imposing array of troops made a considerable impression on the Arab mind. Meteorological. —This was recently transferred to the Civil Administration, and is being carried out by a clerk who can be ill-spared from office routine. There is an observatory near Norfolk House, which contains an anemometer, a wet and dry bulb thermometer, maximum and minimum thermometers, wind vane and rain gauge; also the rise and fall of the Tigris can be measured. Daily readings in all the above are taken at 8 hours and 16 hours, reports being sent daily to head quarters, ‘Amarah section, and Assistant Director, Medical Service. Weekly rain reports are sent to the Weather Bureau, Baghdad, and a very comprehensive monthly report submitted to Weather Bureau, Baghdad, I.G.C., Basrah, and A.D.M.S., ‘Amarah. The highest rainfall for one day, since 1st November 1918, was 2-93 inches, recorded on the 12th November 1918. The highest rainfall for a continuous period was 7-45 inches in nine days’ rain, recorded from 7th November to 15th November inclusive. Maximum rise of river since 1st November was 3 feet. Shabanah Village. —This has long been a thorn in the Military side, on account of its being a hot-bed of prostitution and disease. The question of its demolition was raised some months ago and an assessment of houses, walls, palms, &amp;c. has now been made. The inhabitants have had their marching orders, and by the331 middle of January 1919 there will have been a complete exodus. The majority of these people have already settled in Masikh. Model Villages .—This scheme was first tried in July, but was from the first an unmitigated failure. Only half of the proposed huts were erected, and it was hoped, by abolishing all sarifahs in the town, to induce the inhabitants of the latter to live in this more healthful and sanitary spot. The idea found no favour with the Arabs; and in spite of a bribe of two rupees and four pieces of Chittai he steadfastly refused ever to consider the proposition. The net result was the abolition of all sarifahs, in itself a great achievement, since the whole area between the Tigris and the Chahalah was cleared of reed huts. Land Rents .—This question, which has become acute, is one which needs the whole attention of a committee of assessment. Since our occupation of the town no rent has been paid by Government for land occupied, though rent has been paid for houses since 1st January 1917. For further report on this subject please see remarks under heading of “ Land Rent for Ground occupied by Government,” in Monthly Report for December by the Assistant Political Officer, Town ‘Amarah. Local Resources at ‘Ali Gharbi .—The Shaikhs at ‘Ali Gharbi supplied 410 cattle and 12,600 sheep. In the last two years we have received over 50,000 sheep from this district, and consequently I doubt whether we shall be able to obtain many more in the future. Eighty-nine tons of vegetables were supplied to the Local Produce Officer, and 767 tons of hay. 13. Establishment and Personnel. —The Political Officer and Military Governor’s office consists of the following establishment: Head clerk - - - - 1 general (English branch). Typist - - - - ' 1 5?

There have been many changes in the past year both in gazetted and sub ordinate staff in the office of the Deputy Military Governor or the Assistant Political Officer (Town), there having been no less than seven changes m the position of the D.M.G. or A.P.O. (Town) alone. This has militated against the inception and completion of any large schemes in municipal matters It is to be feared that the office work will suffer in near future when experienced B.O.R.s are recalled to their depots on demobilisation. There is at present urgent need of a skilled assistant engineer, to fill a vacant post on the establishment. Such work now has to be done by an M.E.F. corporal, who although he has done most excellent work, is not, after all, the specialist who is really needed As regards ‘Ali Gharbi, Mr. Baghdadi proceeded there m December as head clerk on probation. It is proposed ultimately to make him Arab assistant. The district has suffered much from frequent changes. . T . , -p Capt Hedgecock has left for England on lorce leave, and Lieut Sevan, Assistant Political Officer, Shabanahs, ‘Amarah Division, is officiating for him in addition to his other duties. R. Marks, Captain, Political Officer and Military Governor, ‘Amarah Division.333 APPENDIX B. Medical and Sanitation at ‘ Alt Gharbi. The Civil Surgeon at ‘Ali Gharbi writes :— ' The Hospital. The statistics of the Civil Hospital are few and somewhat misleading, so it will be better to consider them first. During the past eleven months there have been about 10,200 attendances at the hospital; the number of patients attending daily is, therefore, about 33. But of this number about 10 are children, most of whom require treatment for their eyes. Six others are ‘ dressing cases,’ while another six are old chronic cases, four or five more have minor complaints. The remaining four or five may be called itinerant patients, who just come to the hospital as they are passing through ‘Ali Gharbi. At times the number of these latter, or ‘ birds of passage,’ quadruple or sextuple itself, especially when a donkey or camel caravan is passing through on its way to the hills. Now, out of these groups of patients only about 18 attend the hospital regularly, so that much of one’s work is undone and treatment becomes in many cases symptomatic and not radical. The most cheering feature in a morning’s work is the regular attendance of the children. Something (if only a little) can be done for their eyes, but the principal thing which encourages one is that by systematic scolding and example they are induced to be cleaner, and that in 20 years’ time this pioneer work will bear fruit in a healthier generation. Acting on this assumption there has been instituted for the past month a regular inspection of school children every Tuesday. In this way one is not only able to detect the affected children, but also it compels them to wash their heads at least once a week. “ There have been about 80 operations this year, and every operated case may be considered as a success, for surgical cases (whether major or minor) amongst the Arabs are more satisfactory to treat than protracted medical cases. “ In prophylactic medicine about 500 children have been vaccinated. “ No maternity work has been done so far, but the women are becoming much less reserved, and in particular the Jewish women. “ Incidence of Diseases. —The number of deaths reported up to date is 87, the number of births being 34. The discrepancy in these two figures is accounted for by fact that in many cases the full- timo women leave the town and do not return until some time after the birth of the infant. Both these figures are below the actual birth and death rate, as it is difficult to obtain the exact figures. “ There is one thing which, although not mentioned in any nomenclature of diseases either military or civil, should be placed first in the list of Mesopotamian maladies, as it holds a place of paramount importance, being the father of all diseases. This is dirt. It is the dirty face and body and the dirty clothes and houses that are responsible for more than half the sickness amongst the Arab, Kurd and Jew alike. “ Concomitant with the above are the two commonest diseases, one being diseases of eyelids and conjunctivee and the other, septic wounds and sores. It is out of these two conditions that the Civil Surgeon gains most of his satisfaction and loses most of his temper. “ Of the infectious diseases, pneumonia may be placed first as a terminal event. “ This year the influenza epidemic reached ‘Ali Gharbi in the beginning of September, and a month later there was a second wave of infection. Many of those who were affected in the first attack suffered from a second attack. “ Tuberculosis is more common among the Arabs and Kurds than one would be led to expect. Pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common, then probably tuberculosis adenitis, with Pott’s disease close behind it. “ Syphilis.—Although there are no direct figures bearing on syphilis (I believe), it is not nearly so common as it is supposed to be in this country. This is certainly the case in this neighbourhood. “ Gonorrhoea. Gonorrhoea is, of course, seen among the men only; so far I have not seen a case of ophthalmia neoatorum. “ Dysentery. Dysentery does occur among the Arabs, but it seems to be comparatively uncommon when compared with the dysentery among the British and Indians. “ Malaria. As endemic, does not occur in ‘Ali Gharbi, cases of malaria treated in the hospital generally come from the hilss or from the mahailahs. . . . . “ No cases of plague, smallpox, relapsing fever, cholera or cerebro-spinal fever among the local inhabitants have come under the notice of the Civil Surgeon. No bilarzia ova were discovered in the urine of out-patients complaining of hamiaturia. About 20 cases were examined, which is too small a number from which to draw conclusions. “ Sanitation .—The latrines are divided into two groups : “ (1) Public, some being away from the town in the desert, others being off the main thoroughfares, near the outskirts of the town. . , „ , . “ (2) Private These are burnt, brick-lmed cesspits m the courtyards of houses. About 100 of these have been made this year. They are cleaned out at intervals by Jew sweepers from ‘Amarah. “ There are two groups of incinerators to burn latrine refuse and two little incinerators are being constructed.^ ^ plaoed in the streets and are cleared daily by donkey boys. “ Fiminre —It is verv difficult to arrive at an estimate for the future requirements of the Civil Hosnital as all money matters have been dealt with by the Assistant Political Officer, and due to the Hospital, s p r-J i officers Some of the hospital expenses have gone under the heading of Miscellaneous, while some sanitary charges have come into the Hospital Account. The money granted334 n to the Hospital at present is Rs. 5,000/-, but this sum will not suffice if the hospital is to be run as hitherto, for the following reasons :— “ (1) No account is taken of the Medical Officer’s or the British Sanitary Corporal’s military pay and the equivalent of pay received in rations and clothing. “ (2) Drugs, dressings and instruments have so far been obtained at almost cost price from the A.D.M. stores or from Ordnance. Although it is true that some drugs will fall in price, the Civil Hospital will have to enter the open market as a purchaser and will have to pay the freightage of drugs, etc. “ (3) A few things have been obtained from the Red Cross Society. “ To give a rough estimate of the expenses likely to be incurred the following table is appended :— Rs. p. m. “ Pay of Medical Officer (say Captain R.A.M.C.) - - - 450/- “ Pay of British Sanitary Orderly - - - - - 60/- “ Pay of Arab Personnel - - - - - - 100/- “ Drugs, Bandages and Instruments - - - - - 150/- “ Rent of Hospital - - - - - - 30/- “ Repairs, Clothing, Books and Miscellaneous - - - - 30/- “ All these estimates are on the low side. Even then the annual expenses amount to Rs. 9,840/-, in round figures Rs. 10,000/-. The expenses would probably be in practice Rs. 15,000/- or thereabouts. “ The suggestion made by the Director of Medical Services that in-patients in private wards should be charged Rs. 3/- per diem, apart from attendance, is not feasible in ‘Ali Gharbi, for the rental of the whole hospital building is only Rs. 30/- per mensem. It would be advisable to make out-patients pay a certain fee. They should at least be made to pay for medicines and, except in the case of paupers, a fee for professional attendance could be made. It would make the people more interested in the Hospital, and also make them more particular in following the instructions. “ The finance connected with sanitation has hitherto been separate from that of the Hospital, and comes under the Political Officer. There are six Arab sweepers and three donkey boys, who work under a Sanitary chaush: so the expenses for Sanitary personnel will be about Rs. 225/- a month, or Rs. 2,700/- a year. The tins and crude oil have so far been paid for by the Hospital, which i.s an expense of about Rs. 400/- per annum. If any of the improvements suggested hereafter are carried out the expenses for the following year on sanitation would be raised by Rs. 1,000/-. “ Conclusions and. Suggestions. —To express what the Arab thinks of the Civil Hospital and sanitation of ‘Ali Gharbi is almost impossible, as has already been explained. However one may give a picture of what the Civil Surgeon fancies the Arab does think of him. “ To begin. The Civil Hospital is a good thing; not that it is good in itself (for the Arab has not seen any other hospital) but it is better than that which existed before. “ To continue. Sanitation is a nuisance, but as it seems to be inextricably intertwined with the Civil Hospital it is worth while enduring a slight evil to obtain a greater good. Added to this there are certain disciplinary measures which make it worth while obeying sanitary regulations. “ The Civil Surgeon’s point of view may be simply stated. Much of the time and energy expended in the Civil Hospital is wasted because the individual patient will not obey instructions and the people are not sufficiently educated to understand that all cures are not effected in five davs. The only immediate benefits to be seen are in minor and major surgical cases and in minor medical ailments. However, one hopes by the slow process of educating the rising generation, the hospital may, in 15 or 20 years’ time, be able to extend its influence over a larger sphere. “ Secondly, it is better to prevent disease than to try to cure, and it is easier to handle the mass in a general way rather than the individual in a particular way. Therefore for the present make sanitation the main objective of the Civil Surgeon. “ Suggestions regarding the Hospital. —The hospital is very well equipped in surgical instruments. In the way of other applicances, a better operating table, with side tables and an operating stool and larger steriliser, might be added. A microscope would also be very useful. Repairs and alterations to the building such as glazing the windows, etc., can be left for the present. “ Suggestions as to Sanitation :— , . “ That the present latrines of mud brick be replaced by roofed burnt brick latrines, which could be washed down. “ (2) That a slaughter yard be constructed and the only butcher’s shop should be fitted out with a proper counter and fly-proof meat-safes and fly-proof doors. “ (3) That the present incinerators be replaced by those of burnt bricks. “(f) Tha ^ the s y stem of collecting the dust-bin rubbish by donkeys be replaced by using a Crowley and a conservancy cart. j » “ (5) That definite areas shall be allotted as cemeteries, which shall be marked out and held as municipal land. “ (6) That tents should be kept in reserve for infectious cases so that an isolation camp could be formed. r « • Pe fff^--- Ever y effort should be made to keep a British Medical Officer m Ah Gharbi, and it would be very regrettable if an Eurasian or an Indian were established as Civil Surgeon The Arab is not insensible to differences of race, and if he found an Indian as Civil Surgeon he would regard it as an insult which reduced him to a state like the slave of a servant For the same reason it is advisable to have a British orderly supervising the sanitation The more the British come mto contact with the Arab the sooner will the latter be able to manage his own affairs- but ifthe subordinate positions are filled by Indians, then the very first step of advancement for the Arab is removed already. “ Finally, the Civil Surgeons should not remain in one station for more than a year. In this monotonous country a change is essential, and it would also be better for the Arab; for if one Medical Officer, who had talked to them every day for a year, telling them to wash their faces, was replaced by another medical officer who said the same thing, then at the end of two or three years the Arab might come to believe there was something in what the doctor said.” APPENDIX C. Irrigation and Agriculture. (A)—The District Irrigation Officer has conducted certain surveys of especial interest. They include a survey of the Majar canal, the Chahalah, the Musharrah, and a part of the Butairah. They show how fertile these canals are in rice, and make two points clear : — (a) That the shaikhs concerned get their muqata‘ahs very cheap : (b) That the Butairah area has been hitherto a dark horse and is as rich as the Chahalah. A copy of the D.I.O.’s reports and maps will be available at the office of the Director of Irrigation in Baghdad and will show you the amount of valuable spade-work which has been done by the Department in this Division under the guidance of the Deputy Director of Irrigation and the District Irrigation Officer. The report makes clear the sphere in which the future activities of the Department will be directed. These can be summed up in the following :— (1) The damming and diverting of the Duwairij, which will renovate the soil on the Shatt al A‘mah and remove one of the main barriers to the utility of the Musharrah; (2) The diverting of the Tib to the benefit of the Nahr Sa‘ad and Musharrah areas; (3) The development of the Nahr Sa‘ad area; (4) The dredging of the Musharrah; (5) The dredging of the Mudailil and the bunding of the Dujailah canal, with the possibility of digging the Dujailah canal and connecting its waters with a famous old canal in the Jazirah called the Shatt-al-'Akhdhar : (6) The remodelling of the Majar canal by means of an offtake from the Butairah which will lead down to the Majar area from a much higher level than the Majar and enable the Majar to be closed and so remove a considerable drain on the navigable water of the Tigris; (7) The development of the tail ends of the Butairah on the Jazirah side. This combination of schemes would add a large area of cultivation to the ‘Amarah Division. (B) The report of the Agricultural Circle Officer is not yet to hand, but 1 have seen parts of it in manuscript and found it to contain interesting details of the agricultural possibilities of the Division. I am myself of opinion that the Arab, as a good and long experienced cultivator, has probed the cultivated area to its limit, and that not only has what he has chosen to grow been grown in quantities as great as the soil and the number of cultivators will permit, but that he has also grown just those crops which the soil will most fruitfully bear. Hence I am inclined to be distrustful of the experiments in wheat-growing. Actually a considerable portion of the wheat issued as seed by Government both last year and this year was sold in the bazaar as soon as it was taken over by the shaikhs and sirkals. If these districts had been capable of producing the excellent wheat that is produced in Huwaizah, I think it would have produced it. As it is, barley and rice are the predommant products, and the fact that these are encouraged more than anything else is probably a true indication of the nature and value of the soil. (C)—But the amounts of barley and rice actually produced are probably, m a year of good rain and floods, far above what we estimate. This is important from a revenue point of view It is well known that shaikhs are now rolling in wealth owing to the cheapness of their farm rents under our administration. If this is a poor country, then it might be made richer by an increase m the farm fees of the ‘Amarah muqata’ahs. It could probably be made richer m this way to the tune of, say £T. 10,000 without creating any tribal disturbance m the Division. We have pursued ii policy of generosity hitherto which has probably repaid us by inducing the shaikhs to help us to the best of their ability. But where we reduce, the shaikhs do not always reduce for their sirkals and fallahs, and the day will come when muqata‘ahs are split up into smaller tenancies and each tenancy will produce revenue more truly representative of its worth to Government The Chahalah, the Majar and the Butairah might well suffer a 10 per cent, increase of farm fees. But there will be no possibility of securing revenue reforms without tribal trouble until either the necessity ceases for damming the Majar and Chahalah and possibly the Butairah canals, or a remodelling of these canals takes place in a way which will help us to split up and revise the present holdings. The latter could only be done by enlisting the sympathy of the sirkals and fallahs so as to weaken the power of the shaikhs. As it has been our policy to strengthen the power of.the shaikhs and this policy has helped us to keep peace in the districts, considerable care will have to be taken to win the sympathy of the sirkals before any division of existing power can be made without imperilling the general peace of the districts. (D)—From this point of view the seeming problem of “ landless ” shaikhs may be of use. Every Wll J Shaikh who has any claim to a following will, by virtue of his following, if he is ever given a336 n tract of land, constitute on the occasion of his good fortune a diminution of the power of the existing holder. But the fate of the country must be settled, and the need of undivided rule over large tracts and tribes cease to exist, before we can safely try experiments of this type. One thing seems clear: the policy of backing up the big shaikhs is incompatible with the principle of a wide dispersion of wealth and prosperity. As it is, one thinks of Egypt in terms of “ fallahin,” but one thinks of Iraq in terms of shaikhs. Immediate needs make it necessary and politic to support the big shaikhs. But it will probably be politic in a not very remote future to reverse the procedure, politic from the point of view of breaking up the tribal system in the interests of the peace and prosperity of the majority, and politic from the point of view of the increase of the revenues of the Occupied Territories. If the Government took now, instead of the fees they take from the shaikhs in the ‘Amarah Division, the total amount collected by the shaikhs from the sub-farmers, it would be the richer by thousands of pounds.KUT DIVISION. Administration Report of Kut Division for tlie year ending 31st December, 1918. 1. Political and Tribal.— The last 12 months have for the Kut Division been in on is o expansion and rapid settlement. A year ago this Division only included the Qadhas of Kut, Hai and Badrah. In June last Bughailah was added, and m September ‘Aziziyah and all .the country on the left hank as far as the Diyalah also came under the control of the Political'Officer, Kut. The present Kut Division vpis between September 1915 and March 1917 the battlefield up and down which the armies fought with varying success, and it was only to be expected that the tribes who inhabited the land would be widely scattered, and then areas for cultivation seriously damaged by the construction of trenches and roads and the blocking of canals. During the last year the satisfactory re-settlement of tribes in their original areas has proceeded peacefully, and it is safe to say that now, without exception, all tribes are located, if not always on their original lands, at least on land sufficient for their maintenance. The towns in the Division are all flourishing once more, and the number of coffee and tea shops and tobacconists testifies adequately to the satisfactory condition of the pockets of the people. The Kut Division on the left bank extends from the Diyalah to the Wadi River and includes the Badrah Qadha. On the right bank the northern boundary is the Nahr Qutbah, 4 miles below Seleucia. North-West Boundary. —The ‘Aziziyah portion, where it marches with Baghdad, is bounded by the Diyalah and by the Tigris between the Diyalah confluence and the Ctesiphon bend. North Boundary. —The line across the desert described as the southern boundary of Ba‘qubah and the southern portion of Mandali district in the Khaniqin Division. North-East Boundary. —The Turco-Persian boundary line from the limits of Mandali to the Chayalah River. East Boundary. —The Changulah River and the Wadi down to the Tigris. The Kut al ‘Amarah Division includes ‘Aziziyah, Badrah, Bughailah and Hai. The tribes of the Hai, Kut and Bughailah Qadhas are practically all Bani Rabi‘ah, while those of the ‘Aziziyah area are Shammar and Zubaid. For details and locations of these latter tribes see Appendix A. 2. Revenue : {a) Land Revenue. —All Qadhas of the Kut Division are at present divided up into Shu‘bahs under Mamurs, each Mamur having a clerk and qolchis under him. This system, though producing revenue, is a most unsatisfactory one. The chief causes of its failure are as follows :— (2) The Inefficiency of the Mamurs. —Mamurs were in some cases enlisted locally, and in some cases sent from Baghdad. With few exceptions, these men were found to know nothing of their work, assessment of crops, &amp;c., and some of them were also lazy and delegated their duties to qolchis, who seized the opportunity to extort bribes in cash and kind from the sarkals. (2) The Dishonesty of the Mamurs. —A number of the mamurs were ex-Turkish officials, steeped in Turkish ideals or lack of them. The rates of pay, too, offered for mamurs are not high, and there were undoubtedly many cases when “ presents,” or the non-receipt of them, from sarkals caused the mamurs to look with lenient eye or the reverse on the assessment of crops. This year with a full complement of A.P.O.s, a very considerable number of checks of assessment of crops should be possible, and after the next saifi crop with two years’ shitwiand three years’ saifi estimates available, I hope to be in a position to put up sugges tions for altering the land revenue system of the area to a rental one. By this I do not mean “ iltizam ” in the ordinary sense of the word. With the above quoted Revenue figures it should be possible to form a pretty fair estimate of what the annual produce of each muqata‘ah is likely to be worth, and from this can be worked out the value of the Government share. 1 would suggest that all muqata‘ahs be then offered to their present holders at that rate for a period of from one to three years, according to the reliability or otherwise of the holder. I am confident that by the introduction of some such system not only would the Government revenue be considerably increased, but also that the land would be improved, as tenants would naturally work harder if they held the land for a fixed period. This system would also tend to settle the fallahs, who would in most cases be signed on by their sirkals for the period for which the latter held the muqata‘ali. It would also be welcomed by many Shaikhs who frequently complain of irregularities on the part of mamurs. A statement showing land revenue, shitwi and saifi realised in the Kut Division is attached as Appendix B. (b) Tapu .—The Kut Division has a very large number of complicated tapu questions awaiting the establishment of a branch of the Tapu Department at Kut. A very excellent tapu survey has been completed of Kut town, and it is hoped very shortly to commence tapu work. This is very necessary as, owing to the damage to house property during the siege, and the alteration and re-alignment of many streets, certain buildings have ceased to exist, while the boundaries of others have been considerably changed. At Hai the question of tapu property is a very difficult one, and a special land settlement will be necessary on the Gharraf. During the year a good survey of that area was completed, which will enable a definite settlement to be taken in hand ere long. The whole of the land in the district, with the exception of the Hamidlah lands to the North, which were miri, were originally tapu. The Dairat al Sanniyah acquired the Hamidlah lands and extended them to some originally tapu lands, and also acquired Sulaimaniyah and Umm al Qutaibah. Al ‘Audah passed to Government, as the tapu owner, ‘Abdullah Beg, made it over by deed of gift to the Turkish Government. The rest is all tapu, the owners being all Sa‘dun, except in the one case of Ya‘qub Sarkis, whose father was treasurer to Nasir Pasha. Some tapu sanads have disappeared, and such as exist appear very vague as to boundaries, &amp;c. The gardens around Hai were also originally tapu, farmed by the tenant by iltizam. One such remains, one has apparently been acquired by mugharisji rights, and the remainder by the conversion of Al ‘Audah to miri have also become miri. Tapu Badrah .—It has not been possible to do much in this direction. At a place where there are so many valuable gardens there are naturally many and important disputes about possession. There is reason also to believe that during the last twelve or eighteen months of his residence here, the Qaimmaqam irregularly granted several tapu sanads for a consideration. There was no one of my staff to deal with these questions, and the Revenue Office, Basrah, were unable to supply any one. I have, therefore, not permitted any fresh land to be enclosed. Sale of house property has taken place and this has been registered in the Baladiyah. There are 23 tapu estates in the ‘Aziziyah area. Of these the estate of ‘Ajil al Samarmad was sequestrated and handed over to the Agricultural Department as a demonstration farm. (c) Waqf. There is no waqf property in the Kut, Hai or Bughailah Qadhas. In the ‘Aziziyah district there are two waqf properties : (1) Salman Pak, the proceeds of which are devoted to the shrine there. This property (shortly before our occupation) was farmed to ‘Abdul Qadir Effendi Mutawalli (trustee of Salman Pak) for Rs. 17,650/- per annum ' (period of Abdul Qadir’s lease, from 1st September 1916 to August 1919). (2) The Ghusaibah land (at Bawi). Proceeds from this property are devoted to the shrine of Al A‘dhamiyah, situated in Baghdad district, ' This property was farmed by the Turks in September 1916 to ‘Abdul Wahab ibn Salwan al Jadir for a period of three years at Rs. 1,805/11/- per annum. The annual rent on both estates is due yearly, half in July and balance in August. Both the above Multazims are very dilatory in making payments,At Badrah there are extensive waqf properties. The waqf Madhbut have brought in about Ks. 19,000/— this year as compared with Rs. 10,215/— last year. The gardens are cultivated on the share system, so that, apart from the pay of the mamur, no expense is required to keep them in as good a condition as any private garden. 1 think it would be a good thing if part of the annual proceeds of waqf were disbursed locally. The two mosques are in a dilapidated condition, and it would seem that the building of a new mosque would be an excellent way of expending some of the money. Waqf Mulhaqah. —There are a few cases of this kind of waqf here. It is proposed to make a list of these, and insist on mutawallis producing receipts from the representatives of the pious foundation to which they are supposed to send the money. Waqf Dhurriyah. —It is also proposed to make a list of this property, and to exercise some sort of supervision over the mutawallis. A case was brought to notice recently in which the person in the enjoyment of one of these properties had put the garden out to iltizam and died before the expiration of the iltizam. The multazim was paid off out of the estate of the deceased. (d) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues : Fish Tax. —The taxes of the various Qadhas have been farmed out. The amounts realised by this tax are as follows — Kut ‘Aziziyah Bughailah Hai Badrah Rs. 1,200 „ 3,000 „ 855 „ 485 Nil. ‘Araq .—The tax on the distillation and sale of ‘araq for the Kut, Hai and Badrah Qadhas is farmed for :— Distillation - - - - - - Bs. 14,000 Sale „ 10,000 There is no licensed sale or manufacture at Bughailah and Suwairah. Stamp Duly Receipts. —This is a very profitable source of income in all Qadhas. For details see Appendix C. (e) Customs. —Badrah has a fairly large income from customs. This income is likely to increase considerably in future. In the other Qadhas customs income is practically nil. Kodak. —This was collected through Revenue Mamurs on sheep, camels and buffaloes, and the following table gives the details as collected in Kut Division . jq a l Rs. 43,669 ‘Aziziyah 74,578/8 Bughailah 24,970 Badrah 43,780 Kut 41,338 (f) Compensation : Kut. —During the year a Standing Committee investigated a very large number of claims in connection with damage or requisitions during the ^ The total amount of compensation awarded under this head was Rs. 56,952/-. Despite proclamations and notices many persons failed to put m claims until after the final committee on questions relating to the siege had been held. These persons were, therefore, sent empty away. , . ,, , . The settlement of the above claims was greatly facilitated by the production of all the original petitions submitted during the siege, together with the investigating 0ffi0&lt; kiesep°apers were buried by an employe of the Military Governor, who produced them for me soon after my arrival at Kut. , . . These papers also saved Government a very large sum, as on the evidence contained in them it was possible greatly to reduce claims. on non/ Under the heading of the Kut siege claims may be included the Rs. 20 000/- paid to the relatives of the late Shaikh, Namus of Jassan, who was hanged by the Turks at the fall of Kut, and all his property at Jassan destroyed or confiscated. The sums expended on. compensation in other Qadhas were insignificant. A a 2340 3. Irrigation. —In the ‘Aziziyah and Bughailah areas very considerable work has been undertaken by the Irrigation Department. Detail of this work is as follows :— i Aziziyah .—This j^ear the Irrigation Department have 47 canals under their supervision on the right bank, of which five have already this year been given openings under road and railroad, and similar arrangements are now being made for ten others. The A.I.O. has (as far as is compatible with engineering and material at hand) made arrangements for allotting a separate canal for all cultivators of any size. Smaller cultivators will be given water from main canals with openings already made beneath the railroad. The A.I.O. will control the head of these canals at the take-off and ensure that sufficient water is allowed for the acreage under cultivation, thus obviating, I trust, any squabbles regarding water supply. A two-span regulator has been completed over Bad‘at al Hamad, and at Sha‘urah a one-span regulator is nearing completion, in addition to which the canal is being cleared to a length of 5 miles. On the right bank all canals are being left to the cultivators’ hands, as there is no fear of military damage being caused through mouths washing out, &amp;c., and owners will naturally take precautions to prevent excessive flooding to their crops. On the whole, means of irrigation have been arranged which will suffice for an acreage far in excess of the district’s ability to cultivate, and as far as possible to the satisfaction of all concerned. Bughailah .—Work on the Husainiyah, the Mu‘aiqit and the Musahiyah regulators is nearing completion. This shitwi in this district will have five good canals with regulators—the Bughailah, the Shadi, the Husainiyah, the Mu‘aiqit and the Musahiyab. Last year there were only two canals with regulators, the Bughailah and the Shadi. Work on the Husainiyah regulator has progressed with varying fortunes owing to the demands on the iVmir for labour for other large works in his area, namely, the Husainiyah bunds and the Umm al Sizaj dam. The last is perhaps the most important of the three works. Were it breached, lands as far as Shatrah would be flooded. It is estimated that the Husainiyah regulator will cost Rs. 35,000/- and the Husaniyah bunds, and the Umm al Sizaj dam between them, another Rs. 13,200/-. The Amir of Rabi‘ah is bearing 40 per cent, of the cost of labour emploj^ed on works in his area. The MuWiyah flood-protection bund in the Albu Sultan lands has been completed. This bund involved about 43,000 cubic metres of earthwork and was built entirely by the Quraish. Work on the left bank bunds is progressing satisfactorily. Bunds on the right bank, between the Bughailah Canal and the Nahr Abu Zofar, are in the main completed. The Al Hadd ( anal, which was closed last year, has been opened and given a temporary regulator. The Main Canal, upstream of the Shadi, has also been given a temporary regulator. In addition to the above works the usual bund repair and canal clearance on both banks is being undertaken under the superintendence of irrigation officers. In some places, notably on the left bank between Diyalah and Kut, owing to the proximity of the railway, a very considerable construction is necessary, and it is only with great difficulty that labour can be procured. The early rains and conse quent early sowings have drawn the fallahs on to the land and it requires considerable coercion to make Shaikhs produce their tally of men. On the whole, however, the work is proceeding fairly satisfactorily, and it is hoped that in the coming year the railway will not be breached as was the case last spring. In the Badrah area no irrigation works have been undertaken, and, as a matter of fact, the system out there is an extremely clever one, and it w^ould probablv be difficult or impossible to improve on it. Below Hai town, the big projected scheme is the opening of the silted up Shatt al A‘mah. This is a work requiring very considerable labour and a clearly drawn-up scheme beforehand. Such a scheme has been prepared by the District Irrigation Officer,Kut Major I ounds and it is hoped that it may be put in hand towards the latter half of next year, after the Shatt al Gharraf has dried up. The land ownership and tenancy questions which will be raised by the opening of the Shatt al A mah are likely to be multitudinous and complicated. One of the chief difficulties is the fact that it flows through both Rabkah (Maiyah)and Muntafiq lands. It will probably be advisable to form a species of committee to deal with the division and tenancy of the lands freshly irrigated, such committee to be composed of the A.P.O.s’ Hai and Qahat Sikar, together with leading Shaikhs from the two areas. A special officer, with training in land settlement and revenue, should also be attached to the Committee until a definite and satisfactory conclusion is reached. 4. Agricultural.— There is at present no agricultural officer in the Kut Division. The Circle Officer from ‘Amarah has paid one or two flying visits, during which he visited Hai and Badrah. If any real progress is to be made in agricultural matters an officer should be posted to Kut. The present dairy farm at Kut is a very flourishing one, and a portion of it should be kept on after demobilisation, as an experimental farm where demonstrations and courses of instruction in the use of modern agricultural machinery could be given. The land at present occupied by the farm is tapu, shared by Bait Qadir Pasha of Baghdad and Bait Sabah of Kut. It would not, however, I think, be difficult to induce them to part with it. There are a very considerable and steadily increasing number of pumping engines and “ charads ” already at work in the Division, the 4 Aziziyah Qadha alone containing 24 of the former and 161 of the latter. The Division, and in particular the Hai area, is capable of producing very good hay, and during the year about 2,000 tons were brought in. Owing to lack of paulins, &amp;c., a considerable proportion of this was seriously damaged by the very heavy early rains. Last spring hail and locusts did some damage to crops in the Badrah area, but apart from this, with the exception of the serious damage sustained in the ‘Aziziyah, Bughailah and Kut areas by the bursting of bunds, the Division was very fortunate. 5. Municipalities. —During the year there has been a very considerable improvement in the financial condition of the various municipalities. Conditions call for the upkeep of a large sanitary staff, but owing to greater freedom of trade the income from such taxes as shop tax, wharf tax, &amp;c., is increasing. The approximate annual incomes and expenditures of the municipalities of the Kut Division are as follows :— Income. Expenditure. Kut Hai Bughailah Suwairah Salman Pak Jassan - Badrah - Zorbatiyah Rs. 20,000* „ 14,295/- „ 11,244/15/6 „ 5,500/- „ 1,260/- „ 2,172/- „ 8,126/- „ 1,452/- Rs. 19,710/- „ 17,135/- „ 3,911/8/11 „ 4,500/- „ L225/- „ 2,160/- „ 7,451/- „ L440/- 6. Judicial. Throughout the Kut Division a very large number of cases are settled b} 6 7- reference to one of the following three . {a) Shaikhs’ Majlis. \b) Merchants’ Council. (c) Hakim Shar‘ah. It has been found that such cases as are referred to any of the above are usually settled satisfactorily. _ . There are however, many cases pending, principally land disputes, which will have to be dealt with by a regular Court administering a regular code. * Includes grant in aid amounting to Rs. 6,050.342 7. Education. —The arrangements for education in the Division are still very elementary. Primary schools have been opened at Hai, Bughailah and Suwairah and have a good attendance. At Kut and Badrah there are only mosque schools, where the Quran is taught, and also the elements of reading and writing. The difficulty of obtaining suitable schoolmasters is still very great, and at Kut a suitable building for a school is not available. The average daily attendance at the various schools in the Division is as follows— Kut (Mosque School) - - - - - - 70 Badrah ,, ,, ----- 20 Hai (Elementary School) - - - - - 75 Bughailah ,, „ - - - - - 62 Suwairah - - - - 48 8. Medical and Sanitation. —Medical and sanitary work in the area is greatly handicapped by lack of personnel. At present the only Civil Surgeon in the district is located at Kut, where there is also a civil hospital. There are also dispensaries at Bughailah, Zor and Diyalah. The former is run by a Persian “ hakim ” of doubtful value. At Zor, Assistant Surgeon H. C. Pownes is doing very good work indeed, and at Diyalah there is a civil surgeon. During the last few months outbreaks of small-pox have occurred in nearly every part of the Kut Division, but each of these has been successfully stamped out. A very large number of vaccinations have been performed, but this number is limited by the supply of lymph, which is far from sufficient. Typhus at Diyalah, and cholera at Badrah, were also prevented from spreading. 9 and 10. Police and Shabanahs. —There are no civil police in the Kut Division, their duties being performed by Shabanahs. The Shabanahs of the Division are now organised as one unit and men are frequently drafted from one Qadha to another. During the last few months Shabanahs have taken over the protection of the railway from Diyalah to Kut, and also the marching posts between Kut and the Wadi River. The Hai garrison, too, has been relieved, and also the Kut bridge guards, the grain dump guard, and one of the redoubts on the defensive perimeter. In the Kut, Hai and Badrah areas recruits of a good stamp, both Arabs and Kurds, have been available, and drafts have been sent from Kut to Bughailah and ‘Aziziyah to form the nucleus of the detachments there. In the ‘Aziziyah area great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining recruits, and as it was necessary to take over the protection of the railway without delay, demands were made on local Shaikhs to supply men. Such a system is in many ways unsatisfactory, and only a very indifferent standard of drill and discipline can be exacted from such levies. The ‘Aziziyah Shabanahs are under the supervision of a British officer and an officer is shortly arriving at Kut to take over Shabanah charge there. One Arab officer, two N.C.O.s, and three good men have been sent from Kut to ‘Aziziyah, and it is hoped that in this way and by voluntary local enlistment, to eliminate gradually the men supplied by the Shaikhs. For detailed strengths and distribution of Shabanah in the Division see Appendix D. 11. Labour. —During the year the demands of the various military departments for labour have been very heavy. Both for purposes of porterage and for construction it has been necessary to maintain considerable contingents of Arab labour for work in Kut Camp. This labour has for the most part been supplied by the Maiyah and Sarraj tribes from the Hai District. The Bani ‘Amir and affiliated tribes have contributed only a very small quota, as large irrigation works, including the construction of brick regulators and extensive bund construction and repairs, have been taking place on their lands. Kurds from Pusht-i-Kuh and Karmanshah have proved the mainstay of the porterage labour, but during the summer months their numbers dwindle away to practically nothing.The Aziziyah Qadha, which is very sparsely populated, is supplying as many men as possible lor the river bunds, but cannot, of course, produce more than a very small proportion of the labour actually demanded by the Irrigation Department. 13. Establishment and Personnel. —The establishment of the Kut Division is now complete, A.P.O.s having been appointed for all five Qadhas, and also two A.P.O.s Shabanah for the Division. W. C. F.

As this is the first Report to be written on the working of the division since the cessation of hostilities, I propose writing as full a report as I can in the time at my disposal. 1 mention this last point, as it is difficult for one to devote the time that one would naturally like to devote to this subject, when one has side by side with it to attend to one’s daily duties and the many intricate points in administration which come before one almost hourly for settlement. It is hoped, therefore, that any shortcomings in this report will be duly allowed for and excused. The report will touch on every subject lightly, the principal points being discussed and shown in full Appendices. 1. General. —Up to the early part of 1918 the portion of the division directly administered by us was Nasiriyah and Suq al Shuyukh districts only. The entire Gharraf region for political reasons had not been penetrated. In March 1918 the G.O.C.-in-Chief sanctioned my proceeding to Shatrah, and shortly afterwards A.P.O.s were appointed to the Shatrah and QaTat Sikar districts. The whole of the Muntafiq is now under one administration. 2. Political and Tribal : {a) Boundaries .—The Nasiriyah Division now embraces all tribes that can be definitely called Muntafiq, and the boundaries between the division and Kut, SaniRwah, Qurnah and Zubair Divisions consist of tribal ones, no definite straight or arbitrary line forms the dividing points; in other words, anything Muntafiq comes under Nasiriyah and anything else falls outside it. Thus, on the North the Muntafiq are bounded by the Rabkah tribes (under Kut), on the West by the Bani Huchaim Confederation (under Samawah), on the South by the Desert tribes (under Zubair), and on the east by the Bani Asad group of tribes (under Qurnah). The North-Eastern boundary, where the Muntafiq approach the ‘Amarah tribes, a definite demarkation of boundaries has not yet been taken in hand. A tribal map of the whole Muntafiq is attached to this report, also the approximate boundaries on the North, South, East and West. (b) Tribes comprising the Muntafiq .—For a general history of the Muntafiq from the earliest times see Appendix T. attached. The name Muntafiq means m Arabic a joining together or confederacy, as opposed to the word Mutafarnq, which means separated or scattered apart. The name was first introduced by the Sa‘dun conquerors to denote their having collected a group of separate tribes and formed them into one whole under themselves. The Muntafiq consist of three great groups of tribes, the [а] Ajwad . (б) Bani Malik See tribal map for situation, (c) Bani Safid ) also the purely nomadic tribes, Dhafir, Jasham. The above may all be said to fall into three categories, viz. : settled tubes, semi-nmnadic and nonuidvc. To-day the following are the tribes which form each of the above groups : Bani Richab confederacy, consisting of : Al Salih Al Hatim Albu ‘Atallah Albu Ghuwainim Al ‘Aid Al Jabr Al Humaid confederacy, consisting of Shuwailat Qaraghol ‘Attab Suraifiyin Toqiyah / Hachcham Bani Tamim Ajwad. Titular head, Zamil al Manna 4 .350 ‘Abudah Bani Zaid Albu Sa‘ad Khafajah Azairij Husainat A1 Ghazzi Ahl al Kut Bani Zaid Dalichah Al Budur (semi-nomadic) Al Shuraifat ,, Al Zuhairiyah „ J a warm „ Rafi‘ah Humaid al ‘Arab „ Bani Kliaiqan confederation Mujarrah confederation Albu Salih confederation The many but little known wandering tribes who inhabit the desert land lying between the Tigris, the Gharraf, the Bad‘ah River and Hammar Lake. Ajwad. Titular head, Zamil al Manna‘. Bani Malik. Titular head, Badr al Rumaiyidh (deposed). Bani SaTd. Titular heads, ‘Ulaiwi al Mirhij, Sikar al Na‘mah. Note. —The Arabs distinguish between the three groups by calling the Ajwad and Bani Sa‘id, “ Arab,” as compared with the Bani Malik who are termed “ Ma‘dan.” For ^strength of fighting men of the Muntafiq see Appendix Q, which also shows Bam Malik in detail. (c) Religion. With the exception of the Dhafir and Jasham, who are Sunni ah the Muntafiq tribes are Shi‘ahs. (d) General Characteristics. —All are extremely warlike by nature They are very jealous of their freedom, and take pride in their boast that they are a fighting race and not given to doing manual labour such as coolie work. The only work to which they attach no disgrace is ploughing their fields. Doing coolie work for Government is an abomination for them, and is considered by ah as greatly lowering to their dignity ! his pride of race is particularly marked among the Shatrah Aasmyah and Suq tribes. The Qal‘at Sikar tribes are not quite so particular.’ hven m their case, however, it is on record that at A.P.O. QaTat Sikar’s reouest of about T d fr ° m , Q f^. Sikar to the Rabi‘ah boundary (Kut), a distance about ^0 miles, they made faz ah m their thousands, completed the road but refused to take any money payment; pleading that they were soldiers and’had oTa nar with k cn S r SUCh ’R d ‘mS' 1 they t0 ° k m0ney ’ the y would P ut themselves on a par with coolies and hired labourers. manna, bhonr^ Muntafit l wili uever allow their women to do any SW O t b )?em 1 P ‘ S N u, p0n aS i eVen a greater dis g ra oe than the men working. Some ot them however, notably certain sections of the Khafajah and Humaid do not object to going to Basrah and working for Government there, and also are not above picking and packing dates. 4 &lt; e) TR Fighting Qualities of the Muntafiq tribes have always been renowned.

The Division is divided into four subdivisions or Qadhas / Suq al Shuyukh - - _ _ Captain Ditchburn. _) Masinyah - - - - _ Lieutenant Orgill. - Captain Haysom. - Captain Barrett. also Nasiriyah town - - _ . Rushdi Effendi. I Shatrah CQakat Sikar Nasiriyah Town Each Qadha is run by an A.P.O. directly responsible to the Political Officer of the Division. Each A.P.O., in addition to his other duties, is responsible for the proper management of the municipality at his headquarters, and of any other town he may have in his Qadha. The municipality of Nasiriyah is an exception. It is run directly by a D.A.P.O., who, for the present, is responsible direct to the P.0, for his charge. The following nahiyahs now also exist, each controlled by a Mudir :— Suq al Shuyukh Nasiriyah Shatrah QaTat Sikar Mudir s. Shaikh Hamad al Khamis. Shaikh Farhud al Mughashghash. Saiyid Yusuf al Ba‘aj. Sulaiman al Nasrullah. Shaikh Hammudah. Khamisiyah Bani Khaiqan and Hammar. 'i Bani Sa‘id (Sorah) | Albu Salih Al Hasan - Bat-hah Nahiyah Shaikh Manshad al Habaiyib. ( Suwaij Nahiyah - ( Duwaiyah Nahiyah Taha al Ziyarah. Saiyid Ibrahim al Ba‘aj. Karradi Nahiyah - Hamid al Soz. The policy in the Muntafiq has been tried—and so far with conspicuous success— of appointing the Shaikh of the tribe to be also the local Mudir. Hence all the Mudirs above mentioned, with one or two exceptions, are the natural tribal leaders. This is in direct opposition to the Turkish policy. The next link in the chain of responsibility is the Shaikh of the tribe. It has been my endeavour during my last 31 years in the Muntafiq to get the power in each tribe in to the hands of one man. This person is the Shaikh, and he is selected by Government in each case. This policy has surpassed all expectations, and whereas one found six or seven Shaikhs in each tribe all of equal standing (to say nothing of a host of pretenders) when we first occupied Nasiriyah and Suq, now we find one strong man, who, as a general rule, gets a subsidy from Government and knows it is worth his while to play straight. The responsibilities of the Shaikh are :— (1) Collection of Revenue after the demand has been put on the tribe by the A.P.O. (2) The maintenance of law and order in the tribe. (3) Settling the smaller disputes among his tribesmen, and the larger • ones that may be referred to him by his A.P.O. (4) Providing labour (not casual but by tribe) when a demand is made on him. (5) The collection and handing over to the landlord of the annual rental, where such is possible. To assist the Shaikh there is the Mukhtar or—as he is better known, the Rais al Hamulah. Each tribe has usually four or five such, also selected and formally appointed by Government. The above system has more or less been introduced since the British occupation, and with careful handling will turn out as useful a system as one could want. The point to guard against is the abuse of his powers by the Shaikh. This does not often happen, as the Shaikh knows that he stands or falls largely by the way he treats his people, and is liked or otherwise by his tribesmen. Add to this the subsidy he draws from’ Government (usually Rs. 200/- per month). He values this out of all proportion to its worth and will obey any order rather than risk losing it. In my opinion the “ subsidy idea ” is chiefly responsible for the remarkable state of law and order which now exists throughout the whole Muntafiq confederation. The total cost of such subsidies is insignificant, and what cost there is is far outweighed by the splendid results this policy is obtaining.352 For list of 8a'duns and Shaikhs who draw a monthly subsidy from Government see Appendix U. (This does not include salaries of Mudirs.) For fuller details as to affairs of individual tribes see Appendices M., N., O., and P. for Suq, Shatrah, Qahat Sikar and Nasiriyah respectively. For names of tribes forming each subdivisional area see Appendix V. 3. Revenue.— The Revenue for the Division, I am pleased to report, is growing rapidly. The following figures show in round numbers the revenue takings from all sources for the subdivisions during 1918. For fuller details please see Appendices M., N., 0. and P. under A.P.O.’s reports, where they are dealt with at length. 1917-18. 1918-19. Increase. Expected 1919. Nasiriyah Suq Shatrah - QaTat Sikar Rs. 6,61,461/- 49,487/- Nil Nil Rs. 7,28,429/- 3,42,769/-* 36,820/-* 3,970/-* Rs. 66,968/- 2,93,282/- 36,820/- 3,970/- Rs. 2,38,000/- 4,18,990/- 2,43,940/- 2,23,750/- Nasiriyah. —This district generally will not for some time be a good Revenue paying subdivision, as the surrounding tribal country (Azairij, Ibrahim, and Hassunah), once very rich, has now become practically a desert owing mainly to the Gharraf rivers drying up and taking another course above Shatrah. (See note on Khafajah tribe and on irrigation, Appendix N.) Date Revenue. —Owing to the comparatively few date gardens in the area Rs. 30,000/- per annum will probably be the outside that can be taken for some years to come. Rice Revenue. —Nil. Wheat and Barley—Wi\\ be doubled in 1919. For 1918 it was considered advisable politically to collect one-tenth only, whereas one-fifth is the proper demand. The one-tenth rate was taken throughout Nasiriyah and Suq district, as it was the first time such revenue demand has been made for many vears, and it was thought advisable by the D.O.F. Basrah to enforce our demand gradually. Kodak Revenue (Sheep and Buffalo Tax) is to be taken in 1919 and should realise a further Rs. 50,000/-. Suq al Shuyukh. It is very pleasing to be able to report the progress that is being made in this subdivision. During 1916—1917 only the very smallest demands were made on the tribes, and these practically only on date-trees. The disturbed state generally of the Muntafiq tribes (more specially those round Suq), and the fact that they had never paid revenue to the Turks for the previous 15 to 20 years, made its re-introduction a very delicate matter indeed. In 1916 and 1917 the G.O.C. Euphrates hront, General Sir G. Brooking, K.C.B., issued orders that no revenue whatsoever was to be taken on cereals. This was a wise move, as probably any attempts at its collection would have resulted in armed resistance and possibly open rebellion. In this connection 4 would refer to Suq Administration Report for 1916—1/. Its perusal will show what great strides have been made in Revenue collection since then. During 1918 there has been a thorough count of all Suq date-trees. This, in itself, was a great triumph for the local A.P.O. Beyond a little opposition, the count was done without the need for armed force, beyond a gunboat which was placed at A.P.O.’s disposal to overawe any objectors. Shitwi or Wheat and Barley Revenue for 1918 was taken at one-tenth rate as above mentioned. Ibis again will be increased during 1919, and so Revenue from this source will be doubled, probably trebled, during the coming year Rice should bring in about the same yield next year as this. The demand was purposely on the small side, because of the fact that one has still to depend on the iniquitous Kharas, or estimation system. One knows this system invariably cheats Government of its proper dues, but any attempt to induce the “ Khawaris ” or estimators to improve their figures at once results in the universal cry that Government is pressing unduly on the cultivators. We can do nothing better, however, until a proper large-scale survey is made of the whole country, and Revenue * These are “ P rocess of collection. The figures quoted do not include municipal revenues^demands can be made on the area under cultivation simply by measurement off txlG IXlEtp. Rice Revenue was taken during 1918 for the first time for 15 years, and, as T P 0 C S S uq° f thG dat6 C ° Unt ’ reflects the very greatest credit on Captain Ditchburn, Saifi or Summer Crop Revenue was largely a failure during 1918, owing to floods and a violent hailstoim, which robbed Government of some 30,000 rupees. wpj 36 taken in 1919 for the first time and should realise about Rs. 30,000 For further details see Appendix M. (Revenue). Shatrah. This district was only taken over in May 1918 and it was thought advisable to refrain from taking any Revenue on the shitwi crop, though Khaiyun al Ubaid, Rais of Abudah, offered Rs. 50,000/— for the farm. The saifi crop will realise Rs. 38,300/- and should increase to about 60,000 during 1919. No proper _ haras was made, only an approximate demand. The 1919 shitwi crop should brino 1 in Rs. 80,000/— or thereabouts, while kodah should produce about Rs. 20,000/—. We may assume, therefore, that for 1919 the Shatrah subdivision will begin to pay a good revenue, where up to date we have made no demands at all. For further details see Appendix N. (Revenue). Qal at Sikar. Like Shatrah this district was only occupied last summer, and up to date no demands have been made on the tribes, for political reasons. ' Full shitwi, saifi and kodah revenues will be taken during 1919 and it is expected that a total of some Rs. 2,23,000/- will be obtained. In conclusion, circumstances and the peculiar conditions of the Muntafiq have in the past forced us to be content with a modicum of income. This state of affairs, I have every hope, will largely be put right by the end of 1919. At the same time in fairness to the local administration it should be realised that the pacification of the whole area, more especially the Gharraf and the maintenance of law and order is carried out entirely by locafShabanah forces (mounted and foot). One infantry regiment and one squadron cavalry only now exists at Nasiriyah, and, though our budget estimates for the Divisional Shabanah reaches the large total of Rs. 6,00,000/- for 1919-20, I think that, in fairness to us, there should be deducted from this total the estimated cost of military garrisons which might very easily have been necessary at such places as Suq al Shuyukh, Shatrah, Qakat Sikar and Karradi. I hope, therefore, due regard will be taken of this fact alone when our Shabanah estimates are considered, and when a general survey of the expenditure and income of the Muntafiq Administration is made. I think one can justly be proud of the fact that in probably the most turbulent division in Mesopotamia it is only considered necessary to maintain one Indian infantry regiment. As a matter of fact, in my opinion there is no longer any actual need of a regiment even at Nasiriyah, provided there is a strong striking force at Baghdad or Basrah. All that is required here is a few troops to guard military stores, &amp;c., in the vicinity of the railway station. What is needed is either a large force in Nasiriyah, which will absolve Baghdad or Basrah from responsibility on the middle Euphrates, or nothing at all. 4. Irrigation.—I am pleased to record that my relations between D.I.O. and myself continue to be most cordial. The following are the principal works completed and in hand :— (a) The Bad'ah bund and Shatrah scheme. (b) The Euphrates (Ghafiliyah) Khamisiyah canal. (c) The straightening and revetting of the left bank of the River Euphrates with stone facing in front Nasiriyah town. (d) The Hammar Lake scheme. As regards (a), the bund has been completed across the Bad‘ah and all bye passes dug, and to-day, the 6th January 1919, water has been let down the Shatrah river. For full description see under Irrigation, Appendix N. Owing to unavoidable labour troubles and the early rise of the Gharraf waters the scheme as originally arranged has not been completed. The actual cleaning out of the Shatrah river bed between that town and Hamzah has yet to be done. It is hoped that the autumn of 1919 will see this completed. The half-completed scheme is, however, of inestimable value. Fhe Khafajah tribal country will get a full flow of water two months earlier than usual and twice as much asthey have been accustomed to get for many years; and it is quite possible that the Azairij also will receive a proportion of water where they have had none for many years. In any case the major part of Khafajah country, desert for so many years, should recover its old fertility. The effect for good on this tribe will be of the best. In the past they have been forced to accept one of two courses : (1) to emigrate, or (2) to remain on their tribal lands and support themselves by 7 lobbery and violence. The majority accepted (2) and one cannot blame them; ratliei 1 think must one admire men who from sheer love of their tribal lands preferred to stick to them though reduced to an absolute desert waste and themselves beggared. I he comple tion of the scheme in the autumn of 1919 ought, with reasonable luck, to bring similar prosperity back to the Azairij and A1 Ibrahim tribes. From a revenue point of view the scheme should repay Government very easily, and is of the kind which does more than anything else to raise our prestige among the Arabs. Scheme (b). —Euphrates-Khamisiyah canal has been completed. It was started and completed by the Shaikh of Khamisiyah chiefly by loans made him by Government. The work being finished, the D.I.O. has stepped in and paid over the sum of Rs. 22,500/- to Shaikh Hamad. Government has thus bought out Shaikh Hamad’s rights to the canal, which will advantage him greatly. Khamisiyah should enter on a new period of prosperity now. Scheme (c). —Work on this scheme is in full progress and will effectually put Nasiriyah out of reach of floods from the breaking of its river banks, as used to happen so often in Turkish times. In conjunction with this work, the TXI.O has taken full controi of the whole system of Government protection round Nasiriyah. Scheme (d). —This is a very large scheme indeed and, when completed, should be one of the first magnitude. It should rightly be divided into three separate works :— (1) The complete dredged channel from Bani Hutait to Bani Sa'id. (2) The provision of a permanent bund along the southern edge of the channel above high flood level. This bund to be run along the top of the spoil excavated from the dredged channel. (3) The building of the Ghabishiyah-Chabaish protective bund. The scheme in its entirety will practically mean Nasir Pasha’s scheme over again, properly constructed and on sound engineering lines. % (1) has been finished, with the exception of about half a mile. (2) has just been started under D.l.O.’s supervision. (3) it is hoped to take in hand during autumn of 1919. The advantages to be gained from the above will be :— (1) A deep water channel fit for river steamers will be obtained all the year round across the shallow Hammar Lake. Trade will be enormously benefitted. Lastly, but almost more important than anything else, the political effect on the wild tribes of Suq and Hammar will be incalculable. Already an incredible change has come over the local tribesmen. This is directly due to the new water way and the astonishment and wonder with which the dredgers are looked upon. The fact that a brand new river, over 160 feet broad and 11 feet deep and some 25 miles long, has been made by the “ Inglis ” in so short a time has not only filled the marshmen with awe, but has given them an idea of Britain’s might more than anything else could have conveyed. Already we see a direct effect. The tribes have allowed the date-trees of Suq to be counted, and they have accepted the imposition of a full date and rice revenue without a murmur. Four years ago, if the Turks had been told this would happen, they would have laughed at the suggestion. (2) This bund will effectually prevent the excavated spoil falling back into the dredged channel at high water season, and when storms on the lake raise waves. The bund will also form part of the scheme for the eventual irrigation system which will be developed on the south side of it. (3) This work should, when completed, convert what is now a desolate marsh and no-man’s land into one of the richest wheat-growing areas in Mesopotamia. At a rough guess some 500,000 acres of land will be reclaimed.5. Agmcu^ure.- (1) There is not much to report under this head. 2) An a gi‘ 1 cultural experimental farm has been started at Nasiriyah, and should turn out a great success. (3) agi ieulture is so closely connected with irrigation, nothing much can be expec e until the new irrigation works are completed. In order to help agriculture on and extend the area under cultivation, I would very strongly advocate the purchase of mechanical drain diggers, of American pattern, capable of cutting a channel of the following shape and dimensions :— * —/tft ~ The D.I.O., Nasiriyah, has full specifications in his office, and is himself anxious that six or seven of these machines should be in his charge for improvement of local channels. Such channels or cuts if made on a proper system and under supervision would among other things turn the whole area on the right bank of the river between Nasiriyah and Suq and the railway line into a veritable garden of Eden. The present wheat belt only goes inland for about 4 miles, beyond that is a magnificent belt of arable land only wanting water channels taken out to it to make it yield vast returns at once. The local population is sufficient in number for the purpose, but has not the time, means or engineering skill to take out long canals 7 or 8 miles from the river. (4) A pleasing feature of local agriculture developments, for which credit is entirely due to one 'Abd al Amir, merchant of Nasiriyah, is the putting under wheat and barley of the whole country surrounding Nasiriyah town. Up to date this area has been an absolute desert, and whichever way one rode out of Nasiriyah one had to cross 3 miles of bare salty tract. This now has all been altered, and the spring should show Nasiriyah surrounded by a fine belt of waving corn. The watering of the newly-sown land depends on two oil engines and pumps situated upstream of the town. (5) Speaking generally, 1919 should show a greater yield in wheat and barley than in 1918. Owing to early rains much more land has been put under cultivation than in 1918. All subdivisional officers have issued out either loans in grain or money to help to develop agriculture in their areas. (See Appendices M., N., 0., P.) 6. Municipalities. —The municipalities of Shatrah, QaTat Sikar, Suq al Shuyukh are all in flourishing condition; that of Nasiriyah, I regret to say, not doing so well. The reason has been fully dealt with in Nasiriyah Municipal Officer’s Report to Civil Commissioner, No. 1887/25, dated 13th November 1918. If the suggestions made in that letter are approved and certain sums of money are recredited to the municipality which would appear to have wrongly been taken away, then the financial condition of the municipality will be put on a sound basis again. Recent Improvements .—Three small new municipalities have been recently started in the towns of Suwaij Shijar, Karracli, and Suwaij Khafajah; the first two in QaTat Sikar district and the third in Shatrah district. Rushdi Effendi, late Arab assistant to Political Officer, and an'Arab officer, has recently been put in charge of the Nasiriyah municipality with the rank of Deputy Assistant Political Officer. This is a distinct innovation, for an Arab so far has not yet been given the charge of such an important responsibility in the Nasiriyah Division. I am pleased to report that so far the experiment has been completely justified. Rushdi Effendi is working with commendable zeal, and is popular wherever he goes. Ihe appointment is looked upon with favour by the Arab population, as being both flattering to themselves and as a foretaste of future developments to come. Nothing will popularise our administration so much as the knowledge that important and lucrative posts are open to Arabs of good birth education, and character. I, of course, voice the popular feeling in the Muntafiq. For fuller details on the working of municipalities, see Appendices M., N., 0., P. 7. Judicial.— The “ Tribal Criminal and Civil Disputes ” Regulation continues to be of the greatest value. It is working remarkably well, and I put down the astonishing diminution of crime among the tribes to this excellent and wise Regulation. The tribes are widely content and pleased wdth a system which allows them to settle cases before the Political Officer more or less according to their own tribal laws356 and customs and in the presence of their own tribal majlis. In the towns we, of course, administer the ordinary laws of the land (Baghdad Penal Code). Here, again, the people thoroughly appreciate and understand our methods. The abolition of the ‘Iraq Criminal Procedure Code has been greatly appreciated by all. Crime continues to decrease in the towns. In Nasiriyah, it was proposed some time ago to appoint a Junior Judical Officer. I think this would be a mistake. There would certainly not be enough work for such an official, and secondly, his court would be at once flooded with petitions from Sa‘dun landlords for requests for mallakiyah, and demands to recover lands from the tribes. The result would be a good deal of extra work for Assistant Political Officers, who will be continually having to withdraw cases so opened, not to mention the withdrawal of the thousand and one cases of appeal which the defeated party in tribal cases would be sure to take to the Judicial Officer. The only satisfactory solution would be for such officer to be forbidden to touch either a land case or tribal case situate outside the municipal limits. There would only then be left the crime of the town, which certainly is not enough to justify the expense of keeping a Judicial Officer in the place. 8. Education.— Progress continues to be good all round. The recent inspection of the Director of Education resulted in a satisfactory report. The demand is still great for a religious education in our various schools. This has been successfully met by introducing the Quran everywhere as part of the daily curriculum. It will be necessary to have Shi‘ah teachers to instruct Shi‘ah boys, and Sunnis for the Sunni boys. At first sight the necessity for such a departure would not appear evident, but it has been found to be necessary nevertheless. The feeling against Sunnis in these parts is still very strong, probably due to the fact that under the Sa'dun the Shi‘ah was persecuted, the Sa‘dun rulers being without exception Sunnis. The l\asiriyah school building is a bad one. The administrative Commandant’s office is at present situated in the old Turkish school-house. This is the obvious place for the school. It is hoped that the Military authorities will shortly be able to let us have back the building. For further details re schools of each subdivision see Appendices M., N., 0., P. (under “ Education ”). 9. Medical.—I have nothing much to report under this head. (a] R.B.). A good Civil hospital exists at Nasiriyah (under S. A. S. Dev Raj, (b) A smaller but good hospital has also been recently opened at Suq (under charge of S.A.S. B. Ahmad). (c) At Shatrah and Qal at 8&gt;ikar neither dispensaries nor hospitals have so fai been started owing to the difficulty of getting medical subordinates. 1 hope this will be remedied during 1919, now that the war is over and medical men become available. It is needless for me here to dilate on the great popularity of our Civil medical institution. The attendance return for Nasiriyah alone (see Appendix P ) sufficiently proves this. It suffices to say that next to the efforts of Assistant Political Officers, the greatest factor m redeeming the Arab from his wild state is the doctor and hospital. The appointment of a C ivil burgeon for the Division is a necessity now, and I hope this matter will not be overlooked by higher authority. By special arrangement the S.M.O., Nasiriyah, at present lends us the services of a British medical man for major operations and for the general supervision of affairs in the Civil Hospital, Nasiriyah, whilst the S.M.O. very kindly also takes an interest in the Suq Hospital. These methods can only be regarded as of a “ stop-gap ” nature, and will only last while the 83 C.S.H. remains at Nasiriyah. As soon as that goes, as go it must, surely on demobilisation, we shall be thrown ?^T U ^ 0 T?n reSOUrCeS ' F ° r details of attendance, &amp;c., see Appendices P. and M. ( Medical ). 10. Police.—N il. (#ee Shabanah.) H Shabamh-TIib Shabanah force of the Muntafiq Division may be divided into three heads (A) The Muntafiq Horse (mounted gendarmerie). (B) Suq Scouts (Shabanah, dismounted). (( ) Town Police, Shabanah (for town duty only, dismounted).„ J he 7 ? b ° Ve are ab under tlie command of Lieut. F. W. Hall, Shabanah Officer for the Division, and were entirely reorganished, re-armed, and issued out with °! ie o tanC J ai i d fo l ra \ of .Nothing during 1918. The armament of the Shabanah consists of • 303 short rifles, and their uniform is somewhat similar to that worn by Indian Si ladar Cavalry, except for the headdress, which remains the kaffiyah and agal. 17 Munbafiq Horse (strength, 400).—This corps first came into being early m 191b, and its original strength was 30. In 1917 it was amalgamated with the then existing Muntafiq Scouts (a Military body), and the strength rose to 75 men. In the latter pait of 1917 it became necessary to raise the corps to 200 men, and finally, with our penetration of the Gharraf region, it was decided to raise the number to a corps of a full 400 men. This corps is now entirely responsible for the mainten ance of^ law and order in the Nasiriyah district and throughout the Gharraf (Muntafiq) area. L very effort is made to run the corps as a regiment, and the name Muntafiq Horse was introduced to encourage the spirit of esprit de corps among the men, who one and all are members of the Sa‘dun and Muntafiq tribes. The Duties of the corps are as follows :—(1) The guarding of the main line of communication by river and land in the Nasiriyah, Shatrah, and Qaflat Sikar districts, and making such safe for merchants and travellers. For this purpose a chain of fortified posts is maintained along the River Euphrates, the Gharraf River, and between Shatrah and Nasiriyah. The chain of posts on the Euphrates joins up with a similar chain in Suq district and Samawah (on the east and west). (2) The providing of a local garrison at Shatrah and Qal‘at Sikar in place of a Military one. (3) The finding of escorts for survey, telegraphs, railway, irrigation, revenue, agricultural parties who happen to require protection when out in the district. (4) The policing of the Gharraf and Nasiriyah districts and the general mainten ance of law and order in them. (5) The collection of revenue, and destruction of towers, &amp;c., of recalcitrant Shaikhs, should such action be necessary. Organisation .—The corps is organised as follows :— Headquarters : Lieut. Hall, O.C. Staff : One B.O.R. Quartermaster. Four B.O.R.s Acting Squadron Sergt.-Major’s instructors. One Bash Chaush (Arab regimental sergt.-major). One Arab writer. “ A” Squadron.—Leader : Hizam al Masharah (Sa‘dun). (100 N.C.O. and men). “ B ” ,, ,, Saqban al ‘Ali, s/o the Shaikh of Khafajah tribe. “ C ” „ ,, Yasir al Nahi, Shaikh of the ‘Attak tribe (Humaid). “ D ” „ ,, Faisal al Mashari (Sa‘dun). Each squadron has also an Arab officer second in command. The names of these are :— Mulazim Yunis (an Albanian of good family). „ Jabir (a Shaikh of the Suraifiyin (Humaid). Jabr (brother of the Shaikh of the Azairij tribe). „ (vacant). Each squadron (bulq) of 100 men is subdivided into 10 sections of 10 men (mankkar); each under a sergt. (chaush). One corporal exists per section, but he is unpaid and only wears the stripe. Pay, The pay of the officers and men is as follows :— Squadron leader - - - Squadron officers - Bash chaush regimental - - - - Chaush Sowar, proficient - Sowar, recruit Rs. 250/- p. m. 150/- 9? 100/- 99 80/- 99 70/- 99 60/- 99Regimental institutes consist of :— At Headquarters : Tailor’s shop (Arab) - Veterinary lines : Arab veterinary assistant trained in Rs. 100/- p. m. Armourer’s shop : Arab armourer trained at Ordnance Base depot - - - Carpenter’s shop : Arab carpenter local hospital - 80/- „ 80/- „ Menial Establishment: At Headquarters : 4 sweepers 4 watermen 1 coffee-man at 25/- each ,,25/- „ „ 20 /- „ Syllabus and Training : Recruits’ drill and manual exercise (dismounted). Riding school (rudiments only). Squadron drill. Special course of musketry. Terms of Service. —Six months, with the option of re-engaging as often as desired. Type of Recruit. —Entirely tribal, selections from the best men and families of the district. A demand for so many men is sent in to the various Shaikhs, and the latter supply them. At present each tribe of Nasiriyah and Gharraf has to supply 10 men each. Note. —The system of service is as nearly as possible that of the original Indian Silladar cavalry. Each man provides his horse, his saddlery, and his horse’s feed. He must have his horse passed by the O.C., before it is accepted. Afterwards he may not change it without sanction of the O.C. All that the man receives from Government is : uniform, rifle, equipment, and ammunition. At present, the corps being in its infancy, not a very high standard of efficiency is insisted upon. One’s idea is to popularise service in it. Too much discipline does not suit the Arab, and at the commencement of things it would be a pity to frighten the tribesmen off. As time progresses, discipline will be tightened up, and I have every hope of the Muntafiq Horse eventually becoming the first recognised Arab irregular cavalry in Mesopotamia. In conclusion, I cannot speak too highly of the work done by Lieut. Hall, Commanding Shabanahs. Originally a sergeant in the Queen’s, for the last three years he has been untiring in his efforts to work up his men and make them efficient. He has, I am glad to say, recently been rewarded by the grant of a commission. He deserves much credit for his past work, and I have every hopes of his continuing his good work and bringing his men up to that final standard of efficiency which is expected of them. Distribution. —Shatrah, 100 men (one squadron), finds two outposts : Suwaij, 10 ; Dawaiyah, 10. Qahat Sikar, 50 men (half squadron), finds one outpost: Karradi, 10 men. Albu Hawalah, 5 men, outposts (fortified). Albu Tabar, 5 men, outposts (fortified). ‘Asfuriyiyah, 10 men, outposts (fortified). Safhah Railway Station, 15 men, outposts (fortified). Tall al Muqaiyir Railway Station, 15 men, outposts (fortified). The other 200 men remain at Nasiriyah for training; also act as a striking force in the hands of the Political Officer or Assistant Political Officer, should such be required. B . Sug Shabanah Scouts (strength, 250).—Clothing and equipment is the same as the Muntafiq Horse. The corps is dismounted, and does most of its work in the marshes and among the more inaccessible tribes residing among them. Allthat I have said about the the only difference being the Muntafiq Horse applies equally to the Suq Scouts; organisation, which is as follows :— Headquarters.—O.C., Lieut. Hall; but as the Assistant Political Officer, Suq, takes the his work mostly keeps him in Nasiriyah, place of Officer Commanding. Two B.O.R. Sergt. Instructors; one per company. One writer at Rs. 40/- p. m. “ A ” Company.— 1 Yuzbashi (Muzai'il, minor Shaikh of Bani Khaiqan). 1 Mulazim (Mizhir ibn Qasid, s/o Shaikh of Hachcham). 13 Chaushes. 117 Men.

The corps has made very real strides during 1918, and this chiefly owing to the tact and keenness displayed by Capt. Ditchburn, Assistant Political Officer, Suq. The Muntafiq Horse and Suq Shabanah Scouts cannot, of course, yet be expected to undertake any sort of Military operations alone, but for district Police work and for accomplishing all that is necessary in the way of carrying out the district Civil Officer’s wishes, 1 am prepared to say that the above two bodies of levies are all that are required for the purpose. It may be necessary to raise slightly the numbers as one gets further control of the Bani Sa‘id elements, but that will be all.360 C ” Town Police (Shabanah),—Strength in the Division, 146 N.C.O.s and men. Distributed as under :— N.C.O.s and Men. Nasiriyah Town, one B.O.R. inspector - - - 75 Suq al Shuyukh - - - - - - 22 Shatrah, one sub-inspector - - - - - 28 QaFat Sikar - - - - - - -14 Karradi - - - - - - - 7 Pay is same as dismounted Shabanah. Uniform and equipment i&amp; the same as the Shabanah generally, except that only a belt with two pouches is worn (no bandolier), and the Police kaffiyah is white, instead of red and blue. The work of the Police is satisfactor}^. Recruits are rather hard to get, as it is insisted on the men’s eyesight being good, also a fairly good physique is required. No tribes are allowed in the Police. They have to be townsmen vouched for by the Mukhtars. Sergt. Jeffries, Inspector of the Nasiriyah Police, was a London constable before the war, and that alone, I think, is sufficient praise. He has worked up the men to a high standard of drill, and is untiring in his efforts to teach them the higher duties of Police. 12 . Miscellaneous. —Before closing the Report, I would like to put forward the following two suggestions :— {a) That the titles of Political Officer and Assistant Political Officer be discontinued, and substituted some such titles as Mutasarrif and Qaimmaqam ; or, if these savour too much of the Turkish regime, by some other name which the local Arab can appreciate and better understand. ( 6 ) That certain definite Arab titles and orders be instituted for rewarding of our many Arab friends who have stood by us in the Great War. Some thing after the nature of the “ Order of the Nile ” is, I think, wanted to meet present and future needs. H. R. P. Dickson, Major, Political Officer, Nasiriyah Division. 9th January 1919.Administration Report of Suq al Shuyukh and Hammar Districts for the Year 1918. 1 A.f°!' tTI ft L AND Tribal.—I n previous administration reports of this district the attitude oi feuq and Hammar tribes is said to have undergone a marked change ior the better, consequent upon the success of British arms, the principal events being the capture of Kut, the completion of the Nasiriyah railway line the fall of Baghdad, and the removal of Turkish propaganda in the Hai. This change for the year under review, has been no less marked and to realise fully the progress that has been made one has to try and picture present-day conditions and compare them with those existent prior to the outbreak of war, when for many years the tribes were completely out of control of Government and their own Shaikhs, and lawless chaos reigned throughout. The tranquillity of the present day is sufficient testimony to the signal success which has attended the policy of encouraging tribal responsibility, by backing up Shaikhs capable of controlling their turbulent units. Major H. R. P. Dickson, G.I.E., in his report on this district for the year 1917 briefly summarises the outlook of the Suq tribesman as follows : kC Firstly, no Government means that we retain crops or money, which woidd otherwise be taken from us in form of revenue. Secondly, we retain lands from which we have ejected the rightful owners, therefore we have to pay no mallakiyah (rent) to anyone and have gained good rice lands for nothing. Thirdly, we exist and are prepared to defend ourselves by light of our strong arm, which is always a popular form of existence among savages.” The position to-day is that, firstly, tribesmen are being made to pay revenue on all crops, and these are date, idhrah (millet), rice, wheat and barley. Secondly, the claims of Sa‘dun landlords are now being (poked into, and each case is being settled in amicable compromise. Thirdly, in spite of the fact that the tribes have not been disarmed and that probably 50 per cent, of each tribe could muster rifles, law and order prevails. The significance of this latter point should not be lost sight of, especially when it is remembered—and the tribesman is keenly alive to this fact—that Military garrisons have been considerably reduced and that all Military posts in this district have been relieved by Shabanahs. To turn to the land problems, with the conclusion of the Great War Suq troubles are not yet over. From the date when an Assistant Political Officer first took up his abode here, the agrarian problem of the Muntafiq has been perpetually shelved. It is only natural, therefore, that at this stage the burning question of the moment should now come to the fore with greater force and intensity. Both sides realise fully the issue at stake. They can both see that under a stable Government, and with the rapid development of the country, land must surely increase in value even beyone their wildest dreams in the past. If we intend to follow custom as to the division of crops between landlord, tenant, and cultivator, then we must set about deciding who is the landlord. When once the decisive step is taken and Government declares that it intends to enforce the payment of dues to the rightful owners, the tribes will realise that it is an order from Government and will bow to the inevitable. With the collection of revenue for the first time on all crops, Sa‘dun landlords are attracted from all quarters, and all and sundry with the slightest pretention, no matter how flimsy, to any land are now clamouring for rent. The strength of these claims may be gauged when it is understood that such claimants have probably never seen their alleged possessions, wdiile it is quite certain that, within the living memory of those in possession, they have never collected rents. The work entailed of investigating claims would keep an Assistant Political Officer fully employed, for there are few Sa‘dun cases which are not disputed. In the first place, there are several claimants to the same estate. Secondly, acreage and donums are completely at variance. Thirdly, the boundaries on the sanadsn 362 are sometimes incorrectly spelt; moreover, in cases tliey appear to have been tampered with and are more than confusing. Fourthly, with the gradual reclama tion of land from the marshes, it is extremely difficult to discriminate between the boundaries shown on the sanads as existing when they were drawn up and those of the present day. The most that can be done for the moment is to in\estigate all demands for mallakiyah, and, provided that the mallak produces documentary evidence to support his claim, to arrange an amicable compromise between landlord and serf. This, however, is purely a temporary measure and settles non-disputed Cases. The crux of the acute agrarian discontent which prevails concerns the tribes who have never hitherto acquiesced in the change of status from landlord to tenant, and it is with these we must concern ourselves. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that in many cases a tenant is not averse to paying a small rent to a so-called landlord, for he realises fully that, should his land be declared to be miri, he may be mulcted of a much heavier rent to Government. The work of investigating claims is one that would keep a Lands Officer fully employed. A special Officer, if provided with the necessary machinery, could work on the following lines: First, carry out a complete survey of the whole district; secondly, scrutinise title deeds and demarkate boundaries; thirdly, register in detail the claims of different landlords to the same estate. If some such system was adopted, the work of the land commission would be greatly facilitated. A map of Suq district, giving the names of claimants’ to tribal lands, is being forwarded under separate cover (Appendix F.). Apart from the agrarian problem between landlord and tenant, much land grabbing between tenants or Shaikhs of tribes is attempted. During the past year over three hundred land disputes have cropped up, and a temporary settlement effected in each case. Land disputes between tribes to-day are mainfy due to the chaos that reigned in the past, when each braggart Shaikh was a law unto himself. A common form of land-grabbing was to build towers in a strategic position on the land coveted. In many cases, I have been told, these towers were erected in a night, full preparations were made beforehand, all materials were conveyed to the site, and in the morning the temporary owner of the land upon which the tower had been built found himself the victim of an aggressive neighbour. The next step then would either be an attempt to drive off the invader, ending up probably by bringing all the tribes round and about into the fight, or a retirement from the holding until a favourable opportunity occurred for downing the invader and getting back the land. These towers were manned day and night, usually one man being told off to live there. For a certain period this man’s pay, generally in kind, was not uncommonly a levy upon the whole tribe. The tribesman of to-day having turned his sword into a ploughshare, these towers are now nothing but a landmark of past battle fields. Many have been demolished at one time or the other by Government, others have collapsed, and, again, others are being used as granaries. In connection with towers, it is laid down in para. 35, chapter V., clause I. of the Tribal Criminal and Civil Disputes Regulation, that no tower may be constructed without the previous sanction of the Political Officer. This law puts a stop to the building of fresh towers, but the process of demolishing old ones is slow, and, in view of the fact that they are a constant menace, it is suggested that time nas now come for demolishing all towers once and for all. But to return to the question of land grabbing. Tribes are constantly trespassing upon each others’ territory, and disputes in the past on account of tribal boundaries have been the cause of much bloodshed. After fighting on this score, the usual rule was to declare the land in dispute neutral territory, and a saiyid would invariably be installed in this land to keep the peace. To turn now to the events that have occurred during the year under review. Two incidents are worthy of mention, necessitating the presence of gunboats. The first was to quell, disturbances in the Umm Nakhlah, where two subsections of A1 Sorah, A1 Busharah and Albu Jasim were giving trouble. After a short bombardment five towers were destroyed. The root of the trouble in this case was general misrule by Shaikh Muzai‘il al Busharah, a hardy veteran reputed to be over 100 years of age. In March, this Shaikh was superannuated, and, shortly after, his son Shaikh Hammudah was appointed Mudir of Al Hasan, and the following tribes were included in his Nahiyab : Albu Hamdan, Albu Humaidi, Mushairjah, Bani Muslim, Shahlawiyah, Al Sorah.greatl^Tdcfe^ to 0 the m effioiMcy k of^h™™dmtnistration 1 ' S / £ th' f 0 - 3 + together the once independent and hosfale section^wWoh had^l by brm / ,n § the A1 Hasan group. sections which had broken away from Albu T Salih 00 As T'wa'rriof- , 0 H,i &gt;laCe , oarl &gt;’ m .

Two gunboats and some troops were sent to visit Badr al Rumaiyidh on the 5th instant As Badr refused to come in, his tower was shelled, several of his people killed much damage done, and he was formally outlawed. His rival Sulaiman al Nasrullah, has been appointed Rais of the Bani Malik in his place Nasirjah.™ bU SaMl - Badr ’ S S0D ’ Hasan ’ is bein g detained in Hasan eventually escaped from Nasiriyah and returned to his tribe, and Badr rom this date has not done any overt act against Government. At the present moment, although keenly anxious to come in, he is still hoping against hope that the Turks will return to rule Mesopotamia. ^ £ i A P al ] | U / na ! yid}l 1 l las ^ een a Perpetual thorn in the side of the A.P.O. of this district, and to-day this is especially the case, as Badr’s is the only vi age in this district not paying revenue. The charges against Badr are many, tlie mam one being that he refuses to recognise British rule, has harboured Turkish spies and accepted subsidies from the Turks. His present attitude is disturbing political influences, as any criminal or malcontent has only to step over the boundary into Badr’s territory to find himself safe for the moment from Government. It now remains to be seen whether Badr will come in of his own accord or whether another punitive expedition will be necessary during the next flood season to drive him out from his territory and bring the Albu Salih into line with other tribes of this district. During the past year there has been no intertribal fighting, but several murders have occurred. In July, one in Al Shadid, a subsection of Al JumaPan This tribe is closely connected with the Albu Salih tribe. An attempt was made by some tribesmen of Al Muhawwis, a subsection of Al Shadid, to murder their Rais. These men treacherously attacked at night the hut in which their Rais was living, killed the latter’s brother, and injured two other occupants of the hut. Full blood-money was exacted according to tribal custom. In this case, owino - to the fact that the deceased was a Shaikh, blood-money amounted to Rs. 1 , 000 /- plus “ hishm ” Rs. 500/-. These amounts were paid up, and the cause of the trouble a land dispute has been settled. Since this settlement law and order has prevailed. Another affray occurred in the Hammar Lake among Al ‘Amairah tribe. The trouble in this case was due to a woman’s misconduct. All parties concerned took to arms, and in the fighting that ensued three deaths occurred. This case was settled up according to tribal custom, full blood-money was exacted, a fine levied, and a written agreement taken from both sides to keep the peace/ Since the settlement, no further trouble has occurred. In May, a small affray occurred between Al Juwarin and Al Sumaiyin, two migratory Shamiyah tribes. A Rais, brother of Husain al Qubaih, Rais of Al Juwarin, was killed by a man of Al Sumaiyin. This case was tried in Nasiriyah by the Political Officer. Blood-money, in this case, was Rs. 800/-; the tribe was also fined Rs. 800/-, and the murderers sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment in Nasiriyah Civil Jail. Two tribal towers of Al Sumaiyin were demolished. Since this settlement no further trouble has occurred in this quarter. Other murders have occurred, but these without exception have been due to women. A tribesman sees red at once where his woman or his land are concerned. When it is anything to do with his womenfolk he knows of but one law—the law to kill to avenge his honour. In one case that occurred a lad of about 20 years of age was sent to the Political Officer, charged with murdering his mother. He had little to say, except to own up with disconcerting sincerity to the crime. To the matricide it was not a case for arbitration or for his Shaikh to settle. He briefly stated that he could never have held up his head in his tribes again if he had failed to take the law into his own hands and act according to tribal law.m 364 In other respects the killing vice is, under British rule, not nearly so prevalent as in former years. Rifles are now rusting in their owners’ huts. Indiscriminate firing goes on at night during the date season either by date-garden owners, firing to frighten away thieves, or, on the other hand, thieves firing on the garden owners whilst stealing fruit. No casualties were reported this year, so, presumably, no one was injured. On the whole the Hammar Lake tribes are the most unruly, though, since their inclusion in the Bani Khaiqan Confederation under the Mudirship of Shaikh Farhud al Mughashghash, there has been a noticeable and welcome change for the better. The settling down of these tribes I attribute largely to the Hammar Lake dredging operations. These tribes, knowing little of and caring less for the outside world, and to whom the sight of a tax collector was unknown, now see large steamers, gunboats, and an unending line of balams passing constantly to and fro, and are made to realise the trend of events of the outer world. Shaikh Hatim al Mozan, Rais of Al Juwaibir, who at one time exacted a fee for every balam that passed by his way into the lake, is now one of Government’s staunchest supporters. The boundaries of Suq al Shuyukh and Hammar districts are as follows :— • To the North : Albu Salih, tribal boundary inclusive. To the South : Khamisiyah, inclusive to the railway line beyond. To the East: Albu Shamah, tribal boundary inclusive. To the West: Al ‘Asachrah, tribal boundary inclusive (left bank of river). To the West: Ahl al Kut, tribal boundary inclusive (right bank of river). A statement of confederations and tribes in Suq al Shuyukh and Hammar district, showing names of Shaikhs and approximate strength of tribes, is attached, see Appendix E. . A revised map, showing tribal boundaries, has been compiled and is being forwarded under separate cover (Appendix G.). 2. Land Revenues : Date Revenue. —The basis of date revenue collection in this district is the tree count. A very rough count of trees took place some 20 years ago, and was chiefly confined to the areas round about Suq town. In 1917, as a rough way of raising revenue without disturbing the tribes by tree-counting, a 30 per cent, increase was made on all the old Turkish “ buslah ” (revenue receipt) figures. In August last a count of trees was made throughout Suq district, including the Hammar Lake. As was to be expected, the systematic counting of date-trees for the first time, was the signal for the opening up of all land disputes, and in all about 50 disputes have, been settled. All these have been chiefly in connection with disputes over tribal boundaries or disputes of tribes inter se. A short explana tion may, perhaps, be useful. Each tribe is split up into subsections, and each of these in turn is under its own headman. The actual payment of the taxes due by the tribes is made either through the Shaikh or else by other sarkals (or headmen) of the tribe, that is to say, the headman of each subsection of each tribe. These pay all taxes into the Government Treasury direct. It has been customary for these Shaikhs or Sarkals to levy a small tax (sarkalah). on their own fallahs, but such sarkalah rarely exceeds one anna per tree. Hence the count of date-trees this year has witnessed each sarkal doing his utmost to get as many fallahs as he could entered up under his own name. In the case of disputes over tribal boundaries, the trouble has generally been due to the fact that each Shaikh has attempted to get all fallahs on or near a boundary line entered up under his own name. In settling these disputes I have been guided by the fallah himself. If he owned allegiance to Shaikh “ A ” he would, therefore, be entered on “ A’s ” buslah. If, on the other hand, it was proved that he belonged to, say, Shaikh “ B’s ” tribe, he would be entered as “ B’s ” fallah in “ B’s ” buslah. In the case of disputes within tribes, most of these have been due to the numerous claimants to the role of headman. With the settlement of all disputes this year, collection of date revenue next year should be a much easier matter. Hate-garden taxes, in this district, are assessed at double rates, if the ground under the date-trees is not cultivated. Until this year the rate per tree for land under cultivation (‘ammar) was two annas six pies, that for the other gardens (kharrab) was four annas nine pies. In order to bring the Muntafiq Division intoline throughout, these rates have been revised, and are now two annas six pies and five annas respectively. r The result of the count is as follows :— ( Fruit-bearing trees (‘ammar) ( Fruit-bearing trees (kharrab) - (ii) Non fruit-bearing trees with trunks - (iii) Three years old and upwards without trunks 157,479 172,565 148,873 198,836 Total - - 677,753 Revenue is only collected on fruit-bearing trees. From the large percentage of non fruit-bearing trees the 1918 date crop cannot now be said to have been £n average one, and Suq appears to have suffered in a minor degree from the blight that prevailed generally this year. Items (ii) and (iii) will, therefore, be useful in computing estimates of future revenue. Ruling the count, every effort was made to prevent bribery and corruption of the parties at woik. Fi\e parties in all were sent out, each one with a trust worthy man—in three cases a B.O.R,—in charge. Apart from these, one party remained with me at &gt;Suq. As each party was visited in turn, it was possible to check the work by iccounting occasional gardens. Several discrepancies were thus brought to light. The result of the count will be seen in Appendix A. The revenue from date- trees, already collected, is more than double the amount collected last year. As regards date revenue from the 1919 crops, to avoid another wholesale count, and in order to arrive at a more accurate figure of fruit-bearing trees, two suggestions are put forward. First, by careful scrutiny of the date revenue demand register, any garden with a large percentage of non fruit-bearing trees can be recounted; secondly, by the levy of a general increase all round of, say, 10 per cent, or 15 per cent. To sum up, the effect of the count has been, apart from increase in revenue, that a record of rights has now been made. The date revenue demand registers are in English and Arabic and give full details, such as name of landlord, tenant and cultivator, as well as the number of trees in each holding. Wheat and Barley Revenues .—It was definitely decided early in the year to collect revenue on the shitwi crop at the “ ushr ”'(one-tenth) rate, as it was not thought advisable, for political reasons, to charge the full “ khums ” (one-fifth) rate. The crop was estimated by eye. The evils of this pernicious system are well known, and need not be dilated upon here. The total estimate for the whole district was as follows :— Serial Number. Names. Wheat. Barley. 1 Shamiyah . . - . Maund (168 lbs.) 2,450 Maund (168 lbs.) 3,241 2 Hachcham .... 2,981 1,382 3 Bani Sa'id - - - - 3,292 1.537 4 A1 ‘Asachrah 4,857 3,313 5 Hammar .... 1,828 5,836 Total 15,408 15,309 From Appendix A. it will be seen that the amount of revenue collected this year from this crop was six times more than that collected from the 1917 crop. Owing to the breaking of small bunds on the right bank of the river between Junction Camp and ‘Akaikah, a large proportion of the Bani Khaiqan crops was destroyed by floods. There is every prospect of 1919 crop being an exceptionally good one, especially in the Shamiyah district. The possibilities of this huge district are immense. There are in Suq alone some 30,000 acres that could be put under cultivation provided proper drains and channels were constructed. One of the future works that the Divisional Irrigation Officer has in mind is to build a broad bund extending366 from Nasiriyah to Suq to protect this district, which would secure an area of 90,000 acres from floods during the flood season. In other parts of the district the tribesmen are chary of cultivating this year, owing to the change in local conditions, due to the Hammar Lake dredging operations, the results of which cannot be foreseen or calculated. The river, too, is unprecedentedly high for this time of the year. Idhrah {Millet) Revenue. —This crop has likewise been estimated by eye. Ihe total crop, as estimated by local men, is as follows :— Serial Number. Name of Tribe. Quantity. Maund (168 lbs.) 1 Al Jumai‘an 1,150 2 Albu Salih 320 3 Al Rahamah 1,155 4 Al ‘Asachrah 340 5 Bani Khaiqan ------- 212 6 Al Juwaibir ------- 4,412 7 Hammar Lake 7,720 Total ------- 15,309 Of the above, revenue is being remitted from A1 Juwaibir crops, as these were unfortunately totally ruined through flood water. This at one time escaped from the south side of the Hammar Lake, but was held up this year by the new dredger bund. The result in this case was that cultivated land lying in the north side of the lake was flooded and all crops were lost. I visited the whole of this area myself and found that the crops were then under about one foot of water. This was duly reported to the Political Officer, who ordered total remission of revenue on all crops damaged by floods. Revenue has not hitherto been collected from idhrah crop. The amount due this year is • Rs. 15,256/11/- and is shown in Appendix A. Rice Revenue. —On the whole the rice crop this year is said to have been a good one, but here, again, owing to the sudden rise in the river at the most critical period, due to the opening of the Hindiyah Barrage, large areas of paddy fields were flooded and totally ruined. The work of measuring up paddy fields was entrusted to two Mudirs. Shaikh Farhud al Mughashghash, Mudir of ‘Akaikah and Hammar, and Shaikh Hammudah, Mudir of Al Hasan, the former measuring all rice lands in the Bani Khaiqan Confederation, and the latter all lands in the Mujarrah Confederation. This work has just been completed, and the results are as follows :— Serial Number. Name. Gubbalah, (51 of acre.) Ruined by Floods. Total. Rs. Rs. Rs. 1 Bani Kahiqan 4,682 1,792 6,474 2 Mujarrah 6,403 1,745 8,148 Total - 11,085 3,537 14,622 Apart from the heavy damage caused by floods, a certain amount of damage was caused by early rains and a hailstorm. The revenue that it is estimated will be collected from this crop is shown in Appendix A. and amounts to Rs. 173,058/-. As will be noted, rice revenue will be one of the main sources of income of this district; but it now remains to be seen whether Government will continue to take such a high tax, as it may be impossible for this country to compete with others as regards export trade. Miscellaneous and Special Revenues : Fish Tax. —This tax is farmed. The increase in revenue, compared with last year’s receipts, amounts to Rs. 4,800/-. Tohacco Tax. —In accordance with instructions received from the Revenue Officer, Basrah, a tax was levied on tobacco on 1st April 1917. The increase inrevenue for the period ending 31st December 1918 as compared with the same period of 1917 amounts to Rs. 276/4/-. A proposal has been put before the Revenue Officer to the wholesale dealers in tobacco. If sanctioned, this will bring in a further sum of Rs. 480/- per annum. Shopkeepers dealing in tobacco are at present taxed at the rate of Rs. 15/- per annum. Hawkers are licensed at the rate of Rs. 7 /— per annum. ‘Araq. —Very little ‘araq is sold in Suq. The contractor Ya‘qub al Yahudi manufactures the liquor in Nasiriyah. Rs. 150/- per mensem is derived from the sale of this liquor. Sale of Stamps .—With the abolition of the blockade and permits to travel by rail, the sale of stamps has fallen considerably. Tapu.—ln accordance with instructions received from the Revenue Officer, Basrah, letter No. C. 69, dated 1st December 1917, the copying of sanads was discontinued. This work was restarted on receipt of orders from the Revenue Officer, letter No. 939, dated 5th March 1918, on the condition that it was made clear to all holders of tapu sanads that copies could not be produced as evidence if the original deeds were lost. Further, that the copying of a deed in no way implied an admission on the part of Government of the validity of the deed. The post of Mamur of Tapu, Suq, was abolished from 1st November. This work is now being done by the Mamur of Tapu, Nasiriyah. Waqf. —Suq Waqf is a branch of the Waqf Department under the direct control of the A.P.O., but subject to the supervision and general control of the Head Waqf Department, Basrah. The mosques, of which there are three belonging to the Auqaf Department, are not in good repair. A petition was recently presented by the Sunni community asking that extensive repairs be carried out on two mosques. I am submitting a report on this case to the Political Officer. It has, however, already been made clear to the Sunni community that Government is only administering the property, and that it will only assist if it is clear that Waqf funds will not meet expenditures. A statement of income and expenditure of Waqf property is attached, see Appendix D. In all there is an increase on the income side of Rs. 1,085/10/- and a slight decrease in expenditure. A sum of Rs. 1,769/4/- has been expended on construction of mud walls round the following date gardens :— (1) Bustan Fatimah. (2) Bustan al Jazrah. (3) Shuwailish. (4) Al ‘Aquli. Compensation. —The amount of compensation paid from this office for the period 1st April to 31st December 1918 :— Rs. Debitable to Military estimates - - - - 1,700 ,, Civil Revenues ------ 295 „ Municipal „ 820 Total - - - 2,815 Compensation for trees, &amp;c., cut down in connection with the Hammar Lake dredging operations is estimated at Rs. 25,000/-. 3. Irrigation. —The principal work of this year has been the Hammar Lake dredging operations. This is a military work, and is being carried out by the Conservancy and Reclamation Department of the Inland Water Transport. The importance of this work, which has opened up a navigable channel from Basrah to Nasiriyah, has already been dwelt upon. I am not competent to touch upon anything but the physical features of this work. Briefly, the length of the new channel, in Suq district alone, is about 10 miles, the width is about 170 feet and the average depth 10 feet. The distance of the “ dry cut ” still undredged is about one mile,'and it is expected that the work will take another month before reaching Bani Said. Another dredger, named the “ Quorra,” is now starting to cut her way in from Bani Sa‘id. The object of this is, I understand, to enable the junction of the new channel with the Euphrates to be made gradually and so give the river above Bani Sa‘id time to adjust itself to the altered conditions.n 368 Apart from the work on the new channel, the entrance to the Mazliq Channel has been slightly improved by dredging, and since this channel was connected up to the new dredged channel a means of communication by river has been established between Basrah and Nasiriyah. In this respect it will be of interest to note that during the last quarter of the year about 3,500 balams have passed through the Mazliq Channel, exclusive of numerous steamers and gunboats. Preparations are now afoot to heighten the existing dredger bund, from the entrance to the Mazliq Channel to Bani Hutait, to above known flood level. This work is of the utmost importance, as last year a good deal of the bund was washed away by floods owing to it being below flood level. The decision to carry on this work has been arrived at none too soon, as there will be barely time now to complete this work before the next flood season. It will be carried out by tribal labour, and the usual labour troubles are anticipated, especially as the Hammar Lake tribesmen will be called upon to do this. But it is hoped they will realise that it is all to their benefit and that they will respond accordingly. Apart from actual dredging, the following works have been carried out:— Detail survey of the Hammar Lake. The river has been surveyed and sounded from Qurnah to Nasiriyah. Levels have been run and bench-marks established from Bani Sa‘id to Nasiriyah. Bearing in mind last flood season’s experiences, early precautions have been taken to cope with the 1919 flood. At the instance of the District Irrigation Officer, a Committee meeting was held in September at Suq, at which all Shaikhs of tribes were asked to attend. It was then explained to them that, according to a report from the District Irrigation Officer, the Euphrates at Nasiriyah was capable of carrying seven times as much water as the Euphrates at Suq. In pre-war days, flood water used to escape over the left bank of the river and found its way eventually into the Hammar Lake. Through the bunding of these channels, flood water that could not escape imperilled not only Suq town, but all date gardens. The result of this meeting was that all channels required by the District Irrigation Officer to be left open are to be left open, and written agreements have been taken from all Shaikhs concerned that they are responsible that these orders are complied with. Bunds .—All works, carried out by the tribes this year, have been in the nature of building of bunds to protect their lands from flood waters. In the Hammar Lake a ring bund has been built by the tribes to protect their lands from floods. The total length of this bund is about 6 miles. The tribes concerned in building this were those living on the north side of the lake and are A1 Fuhud, A1 Hawal, A1 ‘ Amairah, Albu ‘ Ayidh al Dabbat and Albu Shamah. The area of land protected and now brought under wheat and barley (winter grains) and idhrah (summer grain) cultivation is estimated at, roughly, 4,000 acres. As has already been stated, owing to the breaking of bunds on the left bank of the Safhah Channel, a large proportion of the Bani Khaiqan wheat and barley crop was destroyed by floods. This also resulted in the whole of the date gardens between the Mujashiyah Canal and Safhah being flooded. These date gardens are said to have produced some of the best fruit grown in this district. Many thousands of date-trees were destroyed, as also grape vines and fruit trees. In order to protect these gardens a “ ring bund ” has been built by garden owners and tribesmen. The length of this is about 5 miles, and, apart from protecting gardens it will also bring under wheat and barley cultivation about 750 acres. Khamisiyah Canal has been completed this year, and proposals have now been sanctioned for the purchase of this canal from Shaikh Hamid of Khamisiyah. The work carried out has been measured up and comes to about 3,000,000 cubic feet. The cost of the canal will be Rs. 22,500/-. Shaikh Hamid agrees to’relinquish his claim as owner of the canal. In connection with this scheme, the following is an extract from a letter No. 1c, dated 26th May 1918, from the District Irrigation Officer to the Assistant Political Officer, Suq al Shuyukh :— “ The acreage is probably over 10,000 commanded. The water supply will, however, only suffice for, perhaps, 3,000 odd. At Rs. 5/- per acre revenue, the canal would almost pay for itself in a year.” In the Albu IChalifah tribal area, a bund is now in course of construction to protect lands from being flooded from Umm Nakhlah waters. The length of thisbuHd iS estimated at about 4 miles, and is only required to be built to a height of about 2 feet. With strong east winds the waters from the Umm Nakhlah are carried to the cultivable land, and actually resulted in considerable damage to rice this year during the treading in process. ’ ... ? ie cro P s cultivated in this district are wheat, barley, rice, mi et and mash. In a large portion of the district two crops are sown yearly. Appendix B. attached to this report, gives the names of all tribes of this district, and shows the quantities of all crops estimated this year. This will be of assistance, as it will show at a glance local conditions in regard to agriculture. Conditions heie are in a state of transition and the fallah is now anxiously waiting to see what effect the dredging operations will have on his rice lands. * ® ar ly fhc year, 32 tons of wheat and 41 tons of barley seed were issued on loan to shaikhs, mostly to those with land in the Shamiyah. This has all been collected. Three hundred and two tons of rice seed were issued. This is now being collected. ® This distiict is self-supporting and no wlieat and barley seed has been issued on loan for the next crop. For various reasons it was not possible to cut one-tenth acre plots of rice fields this year and so arrive at an average figure of the yield per acre in this district. It is hoped that this will be done on all crops next year. 5. Municipality : General —al Shuyukh, “ the bazaar of the shaikhs,” is a famous old Euphrates town, dating back to the “ Muntafiq ” period, when it was the entrepot for the Beduin and the riverain tribesman. Its fame continued unchecked until a rival in Khamisiyah sprang up and deprived it of some of those functions which had given rise to its name. A further blow came when Nasir Pasha al Sa dun built the town of Nasiriyah some 20 miles up stream. It is, however, by no means a decayed or decaying town, occupying as it does so important a position in the heart of a thickly populated area of the Muntafiq countrv ; and if its importance has been eclipsed by other more modern towns in Traq, its lesser importance to-day, as compared with bygone times, is relative rather than actual. Trade and Commerce .—Suq al Shuyukh is one of those few towns in the occupied territories to which the war has not brought prosperity. In Turkish times it had been the river port for one of the desert routes into the interior of Arabia. The establishment of our blockade crippled this caravan track, besides reducing to a shadow the up-river re-export trade from which the Suq merchants had derived much of their wealth. Since that blockade has been removed a revival may be looked for. The most important imports into Suq comprise piece goods, sugar, coffee and tea, while the exports are abas wool, dates, rice, wheat, barley and millet. As reclamation and irrigation schemes bring vast new areas under cultivation, exports must in nearly every particular expand. To tap these resources the building of a railway from Suq to join up with the main line from Basrah, a matter of 15 or 20 miles, would, it seems, be a sound proposition. On the other hand, the present conservancy scheme in the Hammar Lake at once establishes a deep navigable waterway down stream. Presuming, however, that the bulk of exports is for European markets and would be sent northwards to a port on the Levantine coast, the case for joining up Suq al Shuyukh to the main railway remains. An interesting experiment was made during the past year to control prices of foodstuffs in the Baladiyah. A representative meeting of local merchants and notables was called to inquire into the increased cost of living and the means to be employed to check soaring prices. Where they were considered unwarrantable, maximum prices were fixed for a short term, after which they were to be revised in accordance with the state of supply and demand. The almost immediate results were:— (i) The maximum price also became the minimum price. (ii) For a few days supplies threatened to cease and people began to make representation to me to remove the control, saying that half a loaf was better than none. (hi) One became pestered with innumerable petty cases of evasion. In the end I was forced to admit defeat and withdraw the scheme, after it had had only a very hasty trial.1 n 370 Financial .—Suq al Shuyukh has, during the year under review, paid its way. Under the 1919-20 budget it is anticipated that this financial stability ol our baladiyah will be added to during the coming year, enabling many much needed improvements to be carried out. . In one or two cases a modification in our method of collecting taxes has been made, but has not, I fear, had the result looked for by the Revenue Board. While it is agreed that the system of farming taxes is in theory wasteful, in practice it has been found to yield a much bigger revenue than does direct taxation collected by an Arab tax collector. This is due to the Arab instinct, born of long years oi habit, to take backsheesh and allow, in return, the evasion of Government taxes by friends and brother Mussulmans. In principle, the system of farming taxes may possibly operate oppressively on the people, and may further be a sign of weak Government control, but as a revenue producer (in cases where the nature of the taxed article, e.g., reeds and mats, makes supervision of the tax collectors methods impossible) this system is from the point of view of the A.P.O., if of an impecunious and struggling baladiyah, the most successful one. The following figures are illuminating :— R s . Average of five months, February-June, farmed per mensem 130/- (reeds, mats). Average of five months, July-December, direct collection per 100/- mensem. Baladiyah ImpTove 7 ncnts. —Suq al Shuyukh, like most other Arab towns, affords wide scope for improvements, and during the past year many useful schemes have been carried through. Chief among these has been an extension of road along the river front. During last season’s floods the town was threatened with inundation owing to inadequate bunds, but several hundred tribesmen were brought in and the situation was saved. The idea of a broad promenade along the river bank then suggested itself. The chief obstacle to this was a date garden which, for a distance of 150 feet, came down to within two yards of the river, leaving a narrow and dangerous path. A scheme was outlined and sanction sought to cut through this date garden to a depth of 25 feet. To-day a broad and imposing road is the first sight the visitor has on landing at Suq al Shuyukh. On the side opposite stand the Shabanah Headquarters. These are a neat and newly repaired block of buildings, standing in a large open space, where last year stood a dozen or more filthy sarifahs. This w~ork was carried out under my direction, but at military expense, to accommodate the Military Garrison. When the latter was evacuated these premises were immediately taken for the Shabanah Force. Another town improvement which gave much satisfaction to the inhabitants was the laying out of a market place, a scheme which had the advantage of being a sanitary measure as well. The particular site was an area covered by a deep deposit of town refuse. Where it met the bazaar, tribeswomen were wont to fore gather to sell their wares, making the bazaar entrance, ugly and dirty. The area was cleared and a commodious sarifah built to attract these ladies from the bazaar and afford them protection during the hot weather. An innovation, and consequently not so popular a scheme, was the building of public latrines and incinerators. The latter have been utilised for destroying all kinds of town refuse, and the laborious and insanitary arrangement of taking rubbish outside the city walls for burial has at last become but an unpleasant memory. An attempt was made to turn to account the Maude Memorial Fund, but without success. A sum of Rs. 16,000/- was originally subscribed in this district, invested and ear-marked for a boat bridge at Suq al Shuyukh. The difficulty of obtaining materials, and their great cost owing to the war, had brought about an indefinite postponement of the plan. Now, however, that the war is over, it is devoutly to be hoped that the bridge will be able to be built in the ensuing year. For political reasons this is desirable, for Suq boasted of a bridge under the Turk. It had, too, a Turkish bath. This, also, is an important project for the new year, but should, I think, be left to private enterprise. With the hoped-for fall in the cost of material, and a little encouragement from Government, it ought not to be a difficult matter to bring about the floating of a company in the town for this purpose. Crime .—There has been a marked absence of any of the worse forms of crime during the past year, and Suq is maintaining its reputation for a law-abidingcommunity, which it has earned throughout the period of British occupation. During Ramadhan, when sickness was rife, several burglaries were committed, owing to householders having left the town and gone out into their gardens. Suspicion fell upon one man, who it was found, as the result of raiding his house, was the arch thief of Suq. Since his incarceration, burglaries have ceased. For the rest, petty thefts have probably been the work of tribesmen. Sometimes suspicion has fallen upon Shabanah, but in no case has sufficient evidence been forthcoming to convict. This suspicion is a relic of the old Turkish days, when Government existed in name only and when tribesmen—the source from which Shabanahs are drawn—came armed and looted the bazaar. The majlis continues to do good work. While it has no magisterial powers, it is extraordinarily useful in gathering or sifting evidence in cases sent to it by “ order of reference,” and if its judicial processes are elementary, its “ findings ” are usually sound or suggestive and of great help. Conclusion .—The temper of the people is good. A community of merchants, it is, without doubt, pro-British. The three leading citizens, Haji Hasan Hamdani, Haji Ibrahim al ‘Amari and Haji ‘Ali al Dabbus are always anxious to render the Assistant Political Officer their advice and help, while the people, as a whole, are appreciative of one’s efforts on their behalf and for the welfare of Suq al Shuyukh. 6. Judicial.— The majority of the disputes that arise in this district are settled under the terms of the Tribal Criminal and Civil Disputes Regulation. In Suq al Shuyukh, a majlis has been instituted composed of four of the leading citizens, two Sunnis and two Shkahs. Most of the cases referred to this majlis are suits for the recovery of debt. Tribal Disputes .—The evidence of an oath is accepted if the defendant swear to his own innocence in terms which are considered binding before a Saiyid. It has been found advisable, therefore, to appoint each Shaikh as arbitrator for his tribe. The advantages of this are that all minor disputes are settled according to tribal custom. It also serves to strengthen the position of the Shaikh in his tribe. The “ finding ” is submitted to the A.P.O. for ratification. In dealing with important cases, a majlis of tribal shaikhs is convened. The opinions and advice of these shaikhs help the A.P.O. considerably in fiaming a judgment. Shar‘ah Law.—The Qadhis of the ShaFah Court are Shaikh Nuri and Shaikh JaJar, who act as Hakim ShaFah to the Sunni and Shkah elements respectively. 7. Education. —The past year has been eventful for Suq al Shuyukh. It has witnessed the inauguration of the Government primary school, which promises to be of immense value in years to come to those with whom the work of civil administration will then rest. One has been glad of the opportunity of making the school a success, believing that it will be easier to govern a people trained m the means of correct thinking than to have always to combat the forces of ignorance. While it is hoped that the utilitarian side of education has not been neglected the teaching has throughout been based upon the maxim that the aim and end of true education is formation of the boy’s character, lo this end games have been introduced and encouraged. Football, in particular is very popular; physical drill under a qualified army instructor has been included m the curriculum; but over and above all, the virtue of personal cleanliness has been persistently taught from the first. In this connection there is an amusing incident to relate At the prize- giving proceedings following upon term examinations, I dilated at length upon the time-honoured theme of cleanliness. Just as the boys wene about to depart, I nut the question- “There is something of greater importance than English or Arab coHeWhy arithmetio-what is it?” I expected to be answered by a shout in unfson “Cleanliness,” and intended to send the youngsters away with this word on their lips. Instead, however, there was an embarrassing silence, which was at last broken by one bright boy who, rising, saluted and exclaimed, KS/'aB jlbbi l Shi'ah, who enjoy, the oonMenoo o! Sunni » well « of Ship in the town, is instructing all the boys m the Quran, while Shaikh Nun, the Sunni Imam, is instructing the Sunni section in the tenets of their sect C c 2n 372 It was pleasing to find that the Chief Inspector of the then Basrah wilayat. in his notes on June last, paid a tribute to the politeness and respectful behaviour of the boys of the Suq al Shuyukh school. Premises have been a difficult matter. Driven from pillar to post in search of suitable quarters, the school is at last housed in premises which, while not ideal, are the best that can be found in Suq. It is hoped that during the coming year sanction will be accorded to a scheme for building an imposing and worthy school- house. The school register contains the names of 56 scholars, showing an increase of nine, or over 15 per cent, during the last six months. The school is popular, and a further increase in numbers may be anticipated.. It is worthy of note in this connection that Shaikh Farhud al Mughashghash, the most influential tribal Shaikh in this district, has taken a house in Suq in order that his two sons may attend. His example is quite likely to be emulated by other Shaikhs, an event which would carry with it the possibility of doubling the present school attendance. 8 . Medical and Sanitation : Civil Dispensary. —A civil dispensary was first opened in Suq in 1917, the number of patients treated averaging 35 per day. During the last eight months of this year the dispensary has been under the very able charge of S.A.S. B. Ahmad. The total number of cases treated amounts to 14,731, an average of 59-3 per day. Three major and 367 minor operations have been performed. Medicines .—At present no charge is being made for medicines, as every effort is being concentrated towards making the dispensary popular and getting the Arab to realise that the white man has a better cure for disease. It has taken many years of slow and steady progress to make the fallahin of Egypt realise the benefits to be derived from Lady Cromer’s dispensaries. It will likewise be a long time before the marshman loses faith in his own native potions and superstitions. To realise the difficulties ahead it may not perhaps be out of place to mention here a few of the local methods:— In order to drive away fever, innumerable little white flags are placed on the river’s edge on Thursday evening. To get rid of jaundice, a yellow stone is worn round the wrist. Apoplexy (abu damghah).—A red hot iron is placed on the back of the neck. Wounds. —Gunpowder is placed on raw wounds to heal them. Smallpox .—Scabs are collected from a known case of smallpox by women, who then inoculate others by putting a scab, usually on the fore-arm, then pricking the flesh-until blood is drawn. To stop bleeding, a stone, called “ fas Sulaimani,” is worn. Scorpion Bite. —A special metal, if placed on the affected spot, is said to draw out poison. The greatest faith prevails in the wearing of amulets and Quranic verses. Diseases. —The most common diseases are minor intestinary ailments and eye diseases. In winter, pneumonia and bronchitis are very prevalent. Inoculation. —The townee was somewhat suspicious of inoculations, but is now beginning to realise the benefits of this treatment. The following inoculations were performed:— Plague, no record kept. Smallpox vaccinations, 226. A young Arab has been trained and is acting as a “ Public Vaccinator.” Infantile Mortality. —Infantile mortality is extraordinarily high. A certain Mirza Tnayah, a well-known and respected ‘Alim, residing in this district, informed me that he himself had buried 39 children. Several leading members of Suq community have also quoted figures of the number of children each has lost. These figures range from five to ten per man. Epidemics. —A plague epidemic broke out in May, and lasted about two months. Whenever such epidemics break out, the townspeople immediately leave the town and live in their date gardens. Vigorous measures were taken to cope with this plague epidemic, and a temporary hospital was erected outside the city walls, but only a very small percentage of cases were brought to this hospital. Twelve cases in all were admitted. Of these, seven died and five recovered. Owing to the factthat no instruments for performing inoculations were available, a medical officer was sent from Nasiriyah. As far as is known about 50 deaths occurred among townspeople. The number of deaths among tribesmen is unknown. In October the Spanish influenza broke out in this district, and about 40 deaths occurred among the townspeople and about 2,500 among the tribes. Civil Hospital. —-In November of this year a hospital was opened. This, it is hoped, will be the nucleus of a well-appointed and adequately equipped civil hospital. The number of cases treated since the date of opening is as follows :— Admissions: 108. Deaths : Six, chiefly influenza victims. Considerable improvements have been made to the billet taken over from the civil hospital, and, though the present building falls far short of the ideal, it is all that can be done for the moment. Sanitation. —Four public latrines and four bee-hive incinerators have been erected. The excreta of all latrines are removed daily and burnt. Dustbins for the collection of street and house refuse being unobtainable, 25 small open places all over the city have been erected for the collection of house and street refuse. All refuse is removed daily. Houses in Suq are provided with their own cess-pit. These cess-pits are cleaned regularly, but the streets of the city are so narrow that it is imposible to use filth carts for this purpose. 9. Police. —The town of Suq up to recently was policed by Shabanahs, but owing to the fact that demands were being made on the Suq Shabanah force more than it could meet in connection with “ dredger ” work, sanction was asked and obtained to employ an additional 22 men. These men were recruited from the town of Suq, and their duty consists in policing the town by day and by night. These men are put through the same training as Shabanahs. The force is shaping well. 10. Shabanahs. —The Suq Shabanah force has been recently reorganised. The original establishment consisted of :— 1 Mudir. 2 Yuzbashis. C 1 sergeant-major. 250 j 22 sergeants. (. 227 Shabanahs. 1 Arab clerk. The present establishment consists of :— Headquarter Staff. —Two British other ranks (instructors), one Arab clerk. “ A ” Company. “ B ” Company. 1 company commander. 1 company commander. 1 mulazim. 1 mulazim. 125 N.C.O.s and men. 125 N.C.O.s and men. All Military posts in the district were relieved some months ago by Shabanahs. Shabanah posts are established all over the district. Each company goes on outpost duty for one month at a time, and is then relieved and returns to head quarters, Suq al Shuyukh. The distribution of men in the district is as follows : Serial Number. Name of Post. Strength. Tribal Territory. 1 Al Khidhr 5 Al Kut. 2 3 Hadamiyah - ‘Akaikah 5 10 Al ‘Asachrah. Al Rahamah. 4 Ibn Hamdan - 5 Hamash. 5 Albu Humaidi 5 Albu Humaidi. 6 Umm al Wada‘ 5 Albu Hamdan. 7 Al Sorah Umm Nakhlah. 8 9 10 Albu Jasim - Bani Sa‘id - Mazliq 5/ 5 5 Bani Sa‘id. Al Juwaibir.n 374 Serial Number. Name of Post. Strength. Tribal Territory. Hammar. 11 Al Isma‘il 5 Al Ismahl. 12 Military Camp 10 Al Ismahl. 13 Albu Shamah 10 Albu Shamah. 14 Albu ‘Ayish - 10 Albu ‘Ayish. 15 Dredgers 10 Between Mazliq and Bani Sa‘id. 16 Albu Salih 10 Albu Salih. The distribution of the company at Headquarters is as follows :— At each of the five gates 5 men - - - - = 25 Headquarters (Sarai) - - - - - = 100 125 It has been found necessary to help Shaikhs of tribes in collecting revenue by the aid of Shabanahs. These are sent out from the force available at headquarters. The headquarters contingent is one of the Assistant Political Officer’s most valuable assets. It is a striking force, ready to deal with any emergency. Shabanahs are enlisted for a period of six months. Number of Shabanahs discharged since May - - - 40 Number of deaths (influenza cases) - - - - 7 Number of desertions since May - - - - 10 (Date of last desertion, 15th September 1918). Sergeant A. Attwell was appointed as instructor to the Suq Shabanah force, and took up his duties on the 20th April 1918. I cannot speak too highly of this instructor’s work. It is due to his perseverance that the force has attained its present standard of efficiency. The task of training a wild marshman to become a good Shabanah is one that would wear out the patience of many a drill instructor. In 1918 considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining clothing from Ordnance. The 1919 clothing and stores has now been received, and the men have taken quite readily to breeches and puttees. All the force has now been fitted out with clothing. The arrival of these stores has done more than anything else to popularise the force. Apart from the natural benefits to the men in the way of warm underclothing, the force is smartened up out of all recognition, as it was never possible to obtain any semblance of smartness as long as the long khaki “ dugla ” and sandals were worn. Another British other rank, Private. Jones, has been sent to act as instructor, as Sergeant Attwell will, it is expected, shortly be demobilised. The Arab officers are recruited from the tribes, with the exception of the last- named shown hereunder :— “ A ” Company Commander - Muzaihl ibn Jabr of A1 Rahamah tribe. Mulazim - - - Mizhir ibn Qasid son of Shaikh Qasid al Nahi, Shaikh of Hachcham. “ B ” Company Commander - Dulaiyif ibn Khaz‘al (Al Hasan). Mulazim - - - Hamid ibn ‘Ali, Suq. The officers’ dress consists of tunic, breeches, field boots, and Sam Browne belt. Up to recently the Suq Shabanah force was armed with the Mauser rifle. Lee- Enfield rifles have now been provided, and 40 rounds per man are carried. Finally, all efforts to get the men to sign on for a longer period have failed. The result is, therefore, that the force is constantly full of newly-joined men. This system has one good point: it puts a stop to desertions. As regards the leave question, the system adopted from the start—of granting four days’ leave in each month—-is still in vogue. Suc[ Sowars. Thamir Beg al &gt;Sa‘dun continues to maintain 30 horsemen on a monthly subsidy of Rs. 500/-. Their heauquarters is at lmm al Battush, and their duty consists in policing the Shamiyah district.This force is armed with • 303 Martini carbines, provided by Government, also 100 rounds per man, and is inspected regularly by Assistant Political Officer, Suq al Shuyukh. 11. Labour. A most interesting experiment was attempted in October. The Political Officer, Nasiriyah, was in urgent need of labour to complete work on the Sayih Channel, and Suq tribesmen were asked to provide 4,000 men. On the question being put to them, a unanimous decision to “ faz‘ah ” (call to arms) was decided upon. The result was most successful. On the appointed day all tribal banners were unfurled and each tribe in this district provided its quota of men, and proceeded, with its Shaikh at its head, to Sayih (about 14 miles above Nasiriyah). The tribes took with them all their coffee-pots and household stores and camped on the site of their work. Unfortunately the influenza scourge broke out just about this period and hampered the work considerably. Many deaths occurred. In all about 12 days were spent at Sayih, when, owing to the sickness, the work had to be abandoned. On the whole it was a most interesting experiment. Shaikhs who had control over their tribes were able to produce their full quota of men and to retain them at their work until released. It may be of interest also to note that the last time Suq tribes were asked to faz‘ah was by the Turks, when they fought against us at Shutaibah. The influenza epidemic for a time seriously hampered the work of the dredgers and also the harvesting of crops. Several hundred men have been supplied daily for several months now for work on the dredgers. Several thousand more will now be required to complete the scheme of raising the new dredger bund to above known flood level, and steps are now being taken to get them to “ faz‘ah ” again. The Suq tribesman is an independent man with his date-trees and rice land. He would rather pay a substitute at the Government hire than work as a coolie. He refuses to turn out in inclement weather. The job ahead required by the District Irrigation Officer will not be an easy matter, but will be done. 12. Miscellaneous.— On 5th June, Capt. R. A. Haysom was relieved by Capt. A. H. Ditchburn. Capt. B. S. Thomas joined as Assistant Political Officer, Suq al Shuyukh, and was relieved on the 17th December 1918 by Lieut. C. I. J. Berkeley. 13. Establishment and Personnel.— Lists of all personnel are attached herewith. A short note on good work done by officials is shown hereunder. Kadhirn Hamdani, Arab assistant to the Assistant Political Officer. Of all of the officials in Suq district, none more merits award and recognition than Kadhim Hamdani. During the various phases of the war, through fortune and misfortune alike, he has shown the same unflagging faithfulness and dogged purpose in the discharge of many and arduous duties. Mudirs : (1) Shaikh Farhud al Mughashghash, Mudir of Hammar and ‘Akaikah, has continued to show the same steadfast loyalty to Government which he displayed in the very early days of the war. The influence which he has wielded and continues to wield, not only'm Suq district but also among the Hammar Lake tribes, has contributed largely to the smooth running of the administration of this district. (2) Shaikh Hammudah al Busharah was appointed Mudir of Al Hasan on the 1st April 1918, and has contrived by his tact and good management to maintain order in Al Hasan. (3) Saiyid Yusuf al Ba‘aj, Mudir of Bani Sa‘id, continues to do good work. (4) Shaikh Hamid of Khamisiyah continues to show the same loyalty to Government as he has shown in the past. (5) Shaikh Sulaiman al Nasrullah, Mudir of Albu Salih, is carrying on well in a difficult position. ( 6 ) Thamir Beg al Sa‘dun, Commandant of the Suq Sowar force, a leading Sa‘duni notable and a staunch supporter of Government, has faithfully carried on all the work of maintaining order in the Shamiyah district. Fazal Qadir, Mamur of Revenue. A conscientious and hard worker. I cannot speak too highly of the way he has carried out his duties as head clerk. Respected and liked by the local community and tribal Shaikhs, I am confident that as Mamur of Revenue he will continue to work with the same honesty of purpose in a wider field for his capabilities. O C 4376 c No. 5674, Sergeant A. Attwell. —It is entirely due to this instructor’s patience and perseverance that the Suq Shabanah force has reached its present standard of efficiency. No. 202570, Sergeant Byrd. —Recently appointed to the head clerkship of this office. Has throughout shown considerable tact in dealing with Arab merchants in connection with his blockade duties. Is thought very highly of by the local community. 'Abdul Wahab Effendi has been in charge of the Revenue branch during the last year. The extra and added responsibility call for promotion. Saiyid Salih, Rais al Baladiyah, is deserving of promotion. An increase of pay is strongly recommended. Saiyid Saghir, Mir Bahr, Suq, is still the man to get a job of work done. Suq Majlis. —Four leading citizens— (1) Haji Hasan Hamdani. (2) Haji Ibrahim al ‘Amari. (3) Saiyid ‘Abdul Rahman. (4) Saiyid Hasan. A. H. Ditchburn, Captain, Assistant Political Officer, Suk al Shuyukh.381 Shatrah District Administration Report, 1918. 1. Political and Tribal. —Owing to the delayed submission of Shaikh Khaiyun al ‘Ubaid and the hostile attitude of the Azairij, Khafajah, and ‘Abudah tribes, it was not considered advisable to send a Government representative to Shatrah until early this year. Major Dickson, C.I.E., Political Officer, Nasiriyah, first visited Shatrah on 10 th March 1918. Until this date there was no actual control over any of the tribes of this district. An attempt had previously been made to appoint Hasan al Jasim as British representative in Shatrah, but this venture proved a failure owing solely to the fact that Hasan has practically no influence in matters either tribal or municipal. On this first visit the Political Officer, Nasiriyah, appointed Shaikh Khaiyun British representative in Shatrah. The wisdom of such a move was obvious. Khaiyun is easily the strongest and most influential man in this district. He has been Turkish Qaimmaqam of Shatrah on two different occasions. Cordially hated and inexpressibly feared, he has always ruled Shatrah with a rod of iron. To his strength alone is due the fact that Shatrah during the last four years has been able to continue its tribal trade. But for Khaiyun’s presence and rule every shop and house in Shatrah would have been looted and razed to the ground. The political situation in Shatrah still remained uncertain, even after Khaiyun’s appointment as British representative. Khaiyun still reigned supreme, still levied and collected whatever taxes he considered himself justified in taking, and still kept alive his deadly enmity with the adjoining section of the Abudah. Of this feud more will be mentioned later. Towards the middle of April, the political atmosphere became appreciably clearer, and the Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah, with the Political Officer, Nasiriyah, Revenue Officer, Basrah, and other officers rode out to Shatrah from Nasiriyah; while I, then Assistant Political Officer, Suq, joined them by journeying up the Bad‘ah from the Hammar Lake. The party proceeded up the Gharraf, and the Deputy Civil Commissioner was so impressed by the united petitions for a Political Officer, that shortly after I was appointed Assistant Political Officer, Gharraf, with headquarters at Qal‘at Sikar, from whence I had to keep an eye on Shatrah affairs. It immediately became apparent, however, that a reversal of the programme was essential, and that it was absolutely necessary to make Shatrah my headquarters, and from there keep in touch with Qal‘at Sikar affairs. The chief reason for this change was the fact that Khaiyun, on the advent of political officer to the Gharraf, declared himself freed of all further tribal or municipal responsibility, and retired to his own tribe in the Sudaifah. Thus commenced the administration of this district. Very shortly after this the Gharraf district was divided up Al Humaid and Bani Richab confederations going to the Assistant Political Officer, Qahat Sikar, and the ‘Abudah, Khafajah, Bani Zaid, Bani Sa‘id and Albu Sa‘ad being retained by the Assistant Political Officer, Shatrah. About this time came the news of Government’s action at Najaf. This news had more to do with the quietening of this district than anything else. The district, tribal and section boundaries are shown in the map attached hereto (Appendix A.). A list of the sections of each tribe is also attached (Appendix B.). Since the opening up of this district it has been very gratifying to note the way in which wild unruly tribes have kept themselves well in hand during crises. Until recently the killing of a man by a member of another tribe was invariably considered the signal for a “ faz‘ah ” and a battle. Now, however, the murdered man is brought in for inspection and justice is left in the hands of the Government official. This is the best sign one has of the settling down of the tribes. A better idea of the tribal situation can be gathered by dealing with the tribes individually. 'Abudah .—Head Shaikh, Khaiyun al ‘Ubaid. Kbaiyun’s own section of the ‘Abudah is the Sinajir, and it may be said roughly to surround Shatrah on the eastern side. The Sinajir still occupy several houses in the southern half of the town itself. The northern half of the town was, until recently, inhabited by the Albu Shamkhi, another section of the ‘Abudah, whose hatred towards the Sinajir is intense. On several occasions attempts have been made by the Albu Shamkhi382 to murder Khaiyun, and the Sinajir have often attempted to get rid of Hasan al Jasim, leader of the Albu Shamkhi. . . The feud between these two sections reached its culminating point in September 1917. The Albu Shamkhi held a secret meeting and decided once for all to rid Shatrah of Khaiyun and his clever secretary, Kadhim al ‘All Agha. Three men were drawn by lot—two for Khaiyun and one for Kadhim al Ali Agha. P was to shoot Kadhim al ‘ Ali Agha as he came out of the Serai one evening. At the same time the two men detailed for Khaiyun would be waiting in the dusk outside Khaiyun’s own house. It was anticipated that Khaiyun would rush out imme diately on hearing of the death of his secretary and would be fired upon. ^ The first part of the plan succeeded, and Kadhim al ‘Ali Agha was shot dead. Khaiyun, however, suspected a trap, remained in his own house that evening and sent out to faz‘ah the whole of the Sinajir. The next morning Khaiyun set out to exterminate the whole of the Albu Shamkhi. Khaiyun’s methods were very thorough He commenced with the houses of Salman and Hasan al Jasim and went through the whole of the Albu Shamkhi quarter of Shatrah driving men, women, and children before him. A party of Sinajir followed at leisure looting these houses and literally razing them to the ground. The ruins remain to this day a very convincing testimony of Khaiyun’s might and rage. The Albu Shamkhi were pursued to their towers, about 3 miles north-west of Shatrah, and were there besieged. All their villages to the north of Shatrah were ravaged, and not one hut was left standing. One of the Albu Shamkhi escaped to Nasiriyah, and not until orders came from the Political Officer there did Khaiyun return to Shatrah. The whole question of “ fasl ” was settled, but it was not until my arrival here that the Albu Shamkhi once more began to move freely in and out of the town. It was not until the beginning of September last that Hasan al Jasim considered the situation sufficiently quiet to visit Shatrah. I am pleased to report that this feud is dying rapidly. There should be no further trouble between these two sections. Of the other sections of the ‘Abudah easily the most troublesome is the Albu Nujaim. This section is situated directly west of Shatrah—about 6 miles out. Until recently, the section was divided between two factions, one under ‘Araibi al Wanis who looked to Suwailim al Hawowas for protection, and the other under Muhanna al Barghash who was supported by Khaiyun. Recently I was able to patch up the quarrel between these two turbulent spirits, and now they are great friends. Their mukhtars were not so easily pacified, and it was not until two of their towers were demolished that they became quiet. One more section of the ‘Abudah must be mentioned—Al Jahl. It must be mentioned only on account of its Shaikh—Suwailim al Hawwash. This Shaikh is exceptionally strong, and he runs Khaiyun very close in the tribal race for influence and support. Both are cruel—unmercifully cruel and unscrupulous. Khaiyun has behind him a wonderful prestige, due, of course, to his having been Turkish Qaimmaqam. This, however, Suwailim counterbalances by a nature more cunning than it is possible to conceive. Al Jahl causes very little trouble—Suwailim is much too strong to allow them to take liberties; but should, in future, any trouble arise in the ‘Abudah, Suwailim’s cunning must not be forgotten, and his interests in such troubles should be carefully investigated. Khafajah .—Head Shaikh, ‘Ali al Fadhl. The Khafajah up to a short time ago were the noted highwaymen of the district. The road from Nasiriyah to Shatrah was never safe. Merchants were looted, girls were kidnapped, and free fights over division of spoils were frequent. Nor can the tribe be called much to account for this spirit of lawlessness. Easily the largest tribe in the Muntafik as regards territory (of course, I exclude the Bani Sa‘id, which comprises a third of the whole of the Muntafiq), the Khafajah has gradually died on account of the silting up of the Shatrah River. The huge stretch of land between Shatrah and Nasiriyah, once so flourishing, had become a real wilderness. The tribesmen of the Khafajah found themselves without any means of livelihood. Two courses were only open to them—either to migrate to the Mujanah and become subservient to the tribes there, or else to gain their own living by resorting to lawlessness. There was no Government in Shatrah, and so, knowing the Arab’s love for his tribe, his love for raiding, and his hatred for anything which interferes with his freedom, it is not to be wondered at that he chose to live by plunder. One section, the Al Shamkhi, under Kazzar al ‘Ah, moved as a whole into Suq district, and settled down there in the Shamiyah, acknowledging no overlord but Government.383 There is, however, an annual exodus from the Khafajah territory, when hundreds of Khafajah men, women, and children move down to Basrah for the date harvest. When once again the Khafajah lands become available for cultiva tion, this will, to a large extent, cease, though, on account of the date harvest coming at a time when no work is possible on the land, it is improbable that this annual movement will die entirety. When the Political Officer, Nasiriyah, appointed ‘Ali al Fadhl head Shaikh of the Khafajah, the latter, well knowing the state of the tribe, flatty refused to become the Government nominee. For many days he sat on the Political Officer’s doorstep pleading old age and a hundred and one other excuses, and begging to be allowed to live quietly without the worry of .the tribe. He was, however, the man for the appointment, and when he saw there was no chance of release he set to work to repair the damage of years. That he has succeeded is fully proved by the fact that there has only been one robbery of any importance in the Khafajah territory during the past year. Of the various sections of the Khafajah very little need be said, as they cause no trouble. At one time it looked as though Muhsin al Salim, Rais of the Al Salim section, was attempting to usurp ‘Ali al Fadhl’s position, but the continued Govern ment support afforded to the latter settled the incident without the need of any drastic measures. Muhsin has now fallen very much into the background. ‘ Ali al Fadhl is a strong man, but his son Saqban is a man of still greater force of character. He is now an officer in the Muntafiq Horse, and is far and away the best officer in the Corps. In his present position he is receiving a thorough insight into Government methods and requirements, and one looks forward with keen anticipation to the time when he will take over the reins of Government of Khafajah. Then, with a plentiful supply of water, the tribe will grow once more into that former state of prosperity from which it has so unavoidably fallen. Bani Sa‘id .—Head Shaikh, Sulaiman al Sharif. Sulaiman al Sharif is unfortunate in having three powerful factors working against him in his own tribe. They are, firstly, ‘Uwaiyish al Jabbarah, of the Jabbarah section; secondly, Sirhan al Sharrad, Rais of the ‘Udhaimiyin, and thirdly, Shamki al Huwaichim, of Bani Zaid al Dachchah. The latter can almost be omitted, as his tribe is widely separated geographically from the remainder of the Bani Sa‘id (see map). The first two present a rather more difficult problem, as each man is working hard for independence. ‘Uwaiyish al Jabbarah is a weakling both in body and in character. He is at present away on a pilgrimage, and his place, as regards opposition towards Sulaiman, is most ably filled by his cousin Muhammad al Mulla Husain, now in prison. I have had continued trouble with this gentleman, and am now ordering the demolition of his tower. He has been in prison for over a month. This will, I hope, bring him to his senses. He is a land grabber of the worst type, and has before three different courts re-opened a question of talyah which was settled some long while ago by Colonel Howell. This man’s intrigues should be carefully watched, for he spends most of his time trying either to acquire some one else’s land or trying to lower Sulaiman al Sharif in the eyes of the Government. Of Sirhan al Sharrad little need be said. He is a powerful man, who had cut himself off from Sulaiman al Sharif. He, therefore, strongly resents the consolidation of the tribe. But for this, Sirhan is a man of pleasing demeanour, and is always anxious to please. This may, of course, be due to the fact that he wishes to be recognised as an independent Shaikh. Apart from the above, the Bani Zaid give little trouble. Sulaiman is sufficiently influential to keep the tribe in order, and he is generally able to deal with small tribal cases sent to him for settlement. Albu Sa'ad .—Head Shaikh, Husain al Ju‘aiyin. This is a small tribe, but it has given a considerable amount of trouble. It is composed of four sections (see Appendix B.), and the head of each section took very great pains, on my arrival here, to gather together all the influential people of the district for the purpose of informing me that the Albu Sa‘ad was not one tribe but four. Each was independent, and neither could on any account acknowledge the leadership of any one shaikh. For some time I allowed them to continue more or less independently, until I was in a position to ascertain who was the strongest man. The Shaikh with the prior claim to the shaikhship was Sa‘dun al Kuraidi, and I gave him every opportunity of proving his claim. He did not, however, avail himself of those opportunities and has turned out to be more or less a nonentity. His son ‘Ubaid, however, is a good384 worker and has much more influence than his father. He should eventually succeed Husain al Ju'aiyin. This latter, whom I chose after great deliberation, is more like Suwailim al Hawwash in character and bearing—thick set, heavy and extremely cunning, but strong; and it is strong men we require. There is now every prospect of the Albu Sa‘ad settling down quietly under Husain al JVaiyin, who is strong enough to enforce law and order. Their previous unsettled state was that of internal unrest. They did no harm to any one but themselves. Bani Sa‘id (Bad‘ah elements).—Head Shaikh, ‘Ulaiwi al Marhij. The Bani Sa‘id are a long way away and therefore difficult to control. They have caused a great deal of trouble over the supply of labour, and have without doubt played on the fact that they are away in the blue. There is a Mudir at Duwaiyah, but I am convinced that until a British officer can be spared especially for the Bani Sa‘id, difficulties will always arise. The Bani Sa‘id are to Shatrah what the Albu Salih are to Suq. The situation among the Bani Sa‘id is made more acute, of course, by the fact that they are practically next door to Badr al Rumaiyidh. With the latter’s malign influence at work it is not to be wondered at that the Bani Sa‘id are hard to control. Hasan al Badr visited ‘Ulaiwi al Marhij a short time ago, and no doubt tried to convince him that the Turkish Government would be soon returning to ‘Iraq and would reward all who had caused the British Government trouble. ‘Ulaiwi has not been into Shatrah for some long while, his excuse being that he is still very ill. This may or may not be true. Working hand in hand with ‘Ulaiwi is Naif al Mashai. The latter is more amenable to reason, but finds it difficult to work against ‘Ulaiwi’s wishes. Naif has now gone out to the Bani Sa‘id to collect labour for the completion of their work on the irrigation project, and the next few days will show definitely whether he wishes to play up or play the fool. The above applies generally to the whole of the Bani Sa‘id, but particularly to A1 Shams, ‘Ulaiwi and Naif’s own section. The two other sections under the jurisdiction of this district are Al Ma‘yuf and Al Ghashim. These are much more under control and do not give one such an uneasy time. With a British Officer at Duwaiyah the administration of the Bani Sa‘id would be easy, but at present, with a Mudir of little strength of character, control is difficult. There has not, of course, been any active hostility on the part of the Bani Sa‘id, but with one’s fingers on their pulse one can not help feeling that they are unsettled. I am expecting to collect revenue from them on this last summer crop, and I think they will pay up without any trouble. One would, however, like to see them playing up to one a little more. This may come as soon as they find that there will be no further demand on them for labour at present. 2. Revenue : (a) Land Revenue. — Sanction for the collection of revenue on the last summer crop came too late to admit of assessing the revenue in accordance with the khars system. It has, therefore, only been possible to make up one’s revenue demands by gathering together minute particles of information, such as old Turkish demands and mallaks’ dhumans, &amp;c. The result is that for this year a nominal revenue only will be taken. This will, however, prepare the way for a full collection of revenue on the coming winter crop. Attached, as Appendix C., is a list of the demands on the past summer crop. This district is at present being surveyed, but the maps will not, I fear, be large enough to use as the basis on which the revenue is to be collected. The coming winter crop revenue will, therefore, have to be assessed by khars. Much has been said about the inadvisability of this method, but it is the only means one has until a really good ground survey is available. Then one will be independent, and then only will an absolutely correct revenue be collected. Until the Khafajah and Albu Sa‘ad lands are once more put under cultivation the greatest revenue of this district will be derived from the summer crop, and not from wheat and barley as is the case in Qal‘at Sikar district. Attached, as Appendix D., is a list of the muqata‘ahs of this district. ( 6 ) Kodak .—Orders have just been received from the Political Officer, Nasiriyah, directing the collection of kodah on all sheep and buffaloes. It has not been possible yet to make any arrangements for this collection, but I am gathering together information. The Bani Sa‘id alone have very large flocks and the revenue from this tribe alone should be considerable. There are not many buffaloes in this district, and it is estimated that the income derived from buffalo kodah will not exceed a thousand rupees.(c) Tapu. —Up to the time of writing there is no Mamur of Tapu in this district, and thus no revenue has been derived from the registration of tapu documents. &gt; I am applying for a Mamur of Tapu, as I think the time has now come to register all immovable property in this district. (d) Waqf. —Shatrah seems to be exceptionally devoid of waqf property. No doubt the troublous times through which Shatrah has passed has made the acquisition of property far too difficult for owners to part with it lightly. (e) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues : ( 1 ) ‘Araq. —Owing to the fact that the majority of the inhabitants of Shatrah are Muhammadans, there has been very little sale of ‘araq in the town, and no ‘araq contract was made. With the safety of the place assured, the Jewish population are rapidly returning and sales will increase. It should be possible during the coming year to fix up a contract with the Nasiriyah contractor. ( 2 ) Fish Tax. —On arrival here I found that the Turkish Government official had “ farmed ” out the fish tax for three years. I considered it advisable to allow the contractor to complete the terms of his old agreement. The annual income derived from this farm is Rs. 833/8/-. (3) Tobacco Tax. —The usual fees are charged for licences to sell tobacco. They are Rs. 7/8/- per shop and Rs. 3/12/- per hawker for half-yearly licences. The amount realised for the last half-year has been approximately Rs. 210/-. (4) Balam Registration. —As the water has only just come down the Gharraf, the registration of balams is only now commencing. Before the flood subsided in August last it was possible to register about 30 balams. The income up to the present has been Rs. 109/8/-. 3. Irrigation. —One large irrigation project has been carried through, though its effect remains to be seen. For years past all the flood water of the Gharraf has been running practically to waste down to the Hammar Lake. A certain percentage of water found its way into the Hor Sudaifir and Hor Albu ‘Ajul and was used for rice cultivation, but the majority passed through to the chain of lakes between the Gharraf and the Hammar. The result was that year by year the Bad‘ah itself gradually enlarged, while the Shatrah River has been gradually silted up. Had no steps been taken to adjust this, the next few years would have found Shatrah without any river at all. It would then have automatically died or become a desert town such as Khamisiyah or Zubair. But this was only a secondary consideration compared with the irrigation of the Khafajah, A1 Ibrahim and Azairij lands. In years gone by all these tribes were in a most flourishing condition, and if the numbers of disused irrigation channels existent in these tribal territories can be considered any criterion, the winter crop must have been enormous. It was, therefore, to restore these lands to their former glory that the irrigation project was undertaken. The Bad‘ah has been bunded and four by-passes made to regulate the supply of water to the tribes down stream of the Bad‘ah bund. These tribes are the ‘Abudah, Bani Zaid and Bani Sa‘id. Certain short cuts have also been made to increase the capacity of the Shatrah river. A better idea of the scheme will be gathered from the attached map, in which all by-passes and short cuts have been shown. Up to the present, owing to unfinished work, no water has been allowed down the Shatrah River, but by the time this report is typed water should have reached Suwaij. This will be three months earlier than last year. It is hoped that water will to a certain extent scour out the old river bed. When the project was commenced at the end of August, it was hoped that it would be possible to clean out the river bed as far as Suwaij. This, owing to the labour difficulty, has been impossible, but the important items of the scheme have been carried through. The Bad‘ah is bunded, the four by-passes are made and five long short-cuts have been excavated. This year the water will not reach A1 Ibrahim or the Azarij, but it should be possible next year to enlarge upon the project, clean out the river bed, and force water down to these two tribes. 4. Agricultural. —It has been impossible to attempt to improve the wheat or barley cultivation. It was suggested that Karun wheat seed should be sold to the tribes of this district, but the supply was uncertain and the ’suggestion dropped. I have tried to persuade the sarkals to plant a larger percentage of wheat this year, but they do not like the idea. Barley is the safest and the most profitable crop in every way, and the Arab is, on the whole, very conservative.386 The Bani Sa c id had a very fine millet crop this last summer, while the a (Bad‘ah elements) and Bani Zaid both had good rice crops. Nothing has yet been attempted in the way of improving any of these crops. This will, no doubt, come along when the Agricultural Department’s experiments are finished. Agricultural loans up to Bs. 20,000/— have been disbursed. 5. Municipalities : (a) Shatrah Improvements. —The great municipal work of the year has been the building of the Shatrah wall. The work was commenced m June and is only just completed. Though Shatrah is only situated on the right bank of the river, I was compelled to build the wall on both banks—owing to the fact that for the six months of the year the river is dry. The wall has five gates and lour towers. Over the gates are posted Sowar guards day and night, while the towers are only occupied at nighttime by the town police. The wall is a good one, and will withstand a good number of tribal raids—should these ever again become the fashion. The effect of the wall has been all for good, and immovable property has risen three and four hundred per cent, in value. Merchants are now confident, and correspondingly more enterprising. Trade is rapidly increasing. On arrival in Shatrah I was faced with huge mountains of refuse, m some cases 15 to 20 feet high, and completely blocking wide roads. These I am pleased to report are nearly all removed, and only a few at the back of the town now remain. Street lamps have been purchased and the gloomy, uncared-for appearance which Shatrah at first presented has disappeared. The houses were all numbered prior to my arrival by Rushdi Effendi, now D.A.P.O., Nasiriyah. The process of evolution has been gradual, but nevertheless sure. Crime. —I have found exceptionally little crime in Shatrah since I have been here. There have been occasional cases of assault and one or two cases of burglary. Otherwise the town has been wonderfully free from crime of all kinds. Combined Civil Post and Telegraph Office. —About the middle of October a combined Post Office and Telegraph Office was opened in Shatrah. Its working has been most satisfactory. A tri-weekly postal service was arranged, first between Nasiriyah and Shatrah, and now also between Shatrah and Qal‘at Sikar. The post is conveyed by the Muntafiq Horse. On account of rains, &amp;c., it has been difficult to keep the sowars up to time, but on the whole the arrangement works very well indeed. The office more than justifies its existence and the inspector of Posts who visited the office a short while ago was quite satisfied with its efficiency. Water Supply. —This has been a most difficult problem. For six months in a year the river bed is dry, and during this period wells have to be dug in the river bed. The soil is very sandy, and no sooner is a well dug than its walls fall in. The wells have to be cleaned 'out daily. Now that the irrigation project is almost finished, it is hoped that Shatrah will enjoy water for the greater part of the year; but until there is a perennial flow, there will always be this difficulty. I have spoken to the Irrigation Officer on the subject and the matter will be looked into thoroughly as soon as the irrigation work slackens off. It may be -possible to obtain water from the Gharraf by pipe-line; but until the irrigation policy of the country is defined one can do little. General. —There has been a great deal of talk among the townspeople about the return of the Turkish Government to ‘Iraq. This talk has continued in spite of the Civil Commissioner’s declaration in Nasiriyah and subsequent notice in the Basrah Times. This subject became the favourite one for discussion in the diwans of the influential people of the town, and became so common that it was necessary to have copies of the Basrah Times notice posted in all prominent places in the town. This has to a very great extent had the effect of putting an end to such undesirable discussions. (b) Suwaij al DacJichah. —I have not yet considered it advisable to institute “ baladiyah ” arrangements in Suwaij. Everything is left to the Mudir, Tahir al Ziyarah, who is very energetic and keeps the bazaar and streets wonderfully clean. Just lately he has been busily engaged building bunds on either side of the river in readiness for the flood. I should here like to place on record my appreciation of Tahir’s work. He has not been given a very important position, but his work has always been very thorough. He is deserving of a higher billet, and I should like to see his keenness rewarded.(c) Duwaiyah .—This town is rather larger than Suwaij, but it is so very tribal that it is at present almost impossible to treat it as anything but a tribal settlement. It is not nearly as clean as Suwaij, and the very fact that the majority of the inhabit ants are tribesmen makes sanitation and cleanliness difficult in the extreme. Living in Duwaiyah itself is Muhammad al Husain’s section of A1 Ghashim (Bani Sa‘id) while on the opposite bank of the river (also called Duwaiyah) is the encampment of Fajar al Musbach, another section of Al Ghashim. It was suggested on one occasion that the Mudir of Bani Said (Bad‘ah elements) should become Mudir of Duwaiyah only; but it is quite impossible at present to separate the town of Dawaiyah from the tribe. To control the town the Mudir must control the tribe also. 6. Judicial.— The Tribal Criminal and Civil Disputes Regulation continues to meet all requirements. There is very little judicial work, in which only towns people are concerned. On arrival in Shatrah I asked the leading citizens to elect four members to form a majlis. The four were elected, and have ever since sat as a majlis within the meaning of the above-mentioned regulation. They are to all intents and purposes a board of honorary magistrates, though they have no powers. Cases sent to them are investigated and fully reported upon. They are not allowed to investigate any case unless it has been sent them by me under an order of refer ence, neither are they allowed to issue orders concerning the settlement of any case without my authority. It occasionally happens that one disagrees with the decision of the majlis. I have found it advisable to deal with most criminal cases personally. This applies to both tribal and municipal crime. 7. Education. —A small mulla’s school was existent in Shatrah in lurkish times and was still open when first I arrived. I asked for sanction to take it over as a Government school, and was informed that I could do so on the condition that undenominational policy was strictly adhered to. As an alternative it was suggested that an entirely new school should be opened in accordance with this policy. This I did not agree to. First, the Quran was the basis of the education given and it was impossible to effect so drastic a change in one blow. Secondly, I did not consider it politic to open an undenominational school which would have the appearance of being, and would actually be, in opposition to an existing Muhammadan school. In a large cosmopolitan town, this, no doubt, would have been sound, but not in a town 90 per cent, of whose population are Shi‘ahs. However, the Director of Education has laid down a new policy, and I have been able to take over the school. About a fortnight ago the Director of Education paid a visit to Shatrah and inspected the school. He seemed quite satisfied with his inspection and found the scholars quite up to the usual standard. The number of scholars on the register is 150, but the average daily attendance is about 60. , n t £ I hope shortly to send two young Arabs to Baghdad to undergo a course of instruction at Baghdad Teachers’ Training College. At present the teaching profession is not looked upon with favour by the majority of Arabs of good standing. 8 Medical and Sanitation. —A long while ago I applied for a Sub-Assistant Surgeon to open a Civil Dispensary at Shatrah, but there is such a shortage of trained medical men that up to the time of writing there is, I regret to say, no Sub-Assistant Surgeon and no Civil Dispensary. About two months ago a vaccinator was sent to Nasiriyah and properly trained. He has now returned and commenced operations I have suggested that he could do quite a considerable amount of medical work in a small way, if only he could be given a pannier of medicines. The patients would willingly pay for any medicines received. Should there at any time be a spare Sub-Assistant Surgeon, I trust the needs of Shatrah will not be forgotten, for, apart from the alleviation of suffering, the political value of a Civil dispensary is well known. As regards sanitation, I am pleased to report that a great improvement is noticeable in the town. The roads are kept clean and ma c allafs have been built, into which all rubbish is dumped. Up to the present I have not considered the building of public latrines necessary as nearly all houses have private latrines. Two or three public latrines can be built as soon as the .tribesmen become a little more civilised. Nor have I yet built any incinerators, as Shatrah possesses a good number of holes at the back of the town, which should be first of all filled up.n 388 . 9. Muntafiq Horse. —Two squadrons of the Muntafiq Horse are always stationed at Shatrah. The following posts are maintaned by these 100 men :— Duwaiyah—one chaush and 10 men; Suwaij—one chaush and 10 men; irrigation outposts (bund guards, &amp;c.)—two chaushes and 20 men; surveyors escort -two chaushes and 20 men. Thus, 60 are always out, leaving me with a striking force of 40 sowars, should it be necessary to bring any recalcitrant Shaikh to book. I should like to mention here the good work done by the Muntafiq Horse, and especially by Saqban ibn ‘Ali al Fadhl and his squadron. Saqban is always ready to serve no'matter when he is called u pon or what the nature of the work may be. His squadron is the smartest of the battalion. 10. Town Police. —The Shatrah Town Police Force consists of one inspector Husain Effendi, two Chaushes, two Onbashis, and 24 men. The men have been well drilled and are very smart in appearance. Their duties are those of ordinary town Police and they are, as a whole, quite an efficient body of men. The new winter clothing has just arrived and is being issued immediately. 11. Labour. —The providing of labour for various works has been one s greatest difficulty out here in this district. I have been called upon to supply labour for the irrigation project and also for the railway project at Sayih. This past season has been an exceptionally bad one for obtaining labour. The following are some of the difficulties with which one was faced. First, when work was in progress on the irrigation scheme, came the Sayih bombshell. Five hundred coolies were ordered to be sent to Sayih. The order was passed on to the Shaikhs, who refused point blank to send their men to Sayih. The question was asked whether they—the Muntafiq tribes—were considered common coolies to be ordered to work away from their homes like slaves ? Such was the feeling, and it required a great deal of persuasion to get them into Sayih. The very fact of getting them there was a triumph. They were not there very long when the influenza epidemic broke out. The Khafajah and the Albu Sa‘ad each had as many as 20 to 30 deaths a day. This naturally took all the heart out of these people, and they cared not what happened to them. At last the epidemic passed over and Muharram came along. When Muharram was over, one looked for two months’ good work. Then came the last blow—a very fine downpour of early rain. The opportunity was too good to be missed. Early rain such as this, comes very rarely, and the labour began to melt away and the ploughs become busy. These are a few of the difficulties one has had to contend with. It is certainly not to be wondered at that the supply did not come up to the demand. 12. Miscellaneous. —I should like to place on record, before closing, my appreciation of the valuable assistance given me by Shaikh Khaiyun al ‘Ubaid. Khaiyun’s position has been a most difficult one, for on my arrival he was compelled to relinquish that which the ordinary Arab dearly loves—exercising authority. It may be said that Khaiyun had his tribe to which to return. That is true. But it is also true that the majority of influential Shaikhs of this district looked upon Khaiyun’s return to Sudaifah as a defeat. It must have been a bitter pill for Khaiyun to swallow. His assistance was, therefore, all the more praiseworthy. He helped me to knock down idols which he himself had set up. This help, given when I most needed help, was of more value than it is possible to realise. I therefore hope that his good work will be placed on record. G. A. Haysom, Captain, Assistant Political Officer, Shatrah. Copy to— , ( 1 ) The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, through the Political Officer, Nasiriyah. (2) The Political Officer, Nasiriyah Division, Nasiriyah.Qarat Sikar Administration Report, 1918. 1. Introductory. —The administration of this district commenced in June of this year, when I was appointed A.P.O., Gharraf, with headquarters at Qal‘at Sikar. I remained at Qahat Sikar about eight days only, when the situation in Shatrah became acute and I was compelled to transfer my attentions there. During my short stay at Qakat Sikar, I was visited by all the Shaikhs and pretenders of the district, but had not sufficient time to gain that intimate knowledge which is so necessary to good administration. While in Shatrah I saw very few of the Qakat Sikar people, and the result was that, when Captain My lies, M.C., took over charge of the district towards the end of July, I was able to give him very little assistance indeed. He had to work out his own salvation. On the 27th November, Captain Mylles was transferred, and once more QaFat Sikar district has come temporarily under my care. My knowledge of the district is, therefore, very limited, and allowance must be made should this administration report appear sketchy. 2. Political and Tribal : (a) General .—In Turkish times, Qahat Sikar was a nahiyah, not a qadha, and it speaks extraordinarily well for the tribes that they were always more under control with a Mudir at their head than were the tribes of Shatrah who boasted of a Qaimmaqam and a garrison. Of late years the one outstanding personality on the Gharraf was Yusuf al Khairullah. He was to all intents and purposes Shaikh of the whole of the Gharraf—not merely Al Humaid. Nor was his position due entirely to his ability as a soldier. He was a warrior and a great one, but he was also a good administrator. To his strength of character alone is due the comparatively settled state of the Gharraf. Yusuf al Khairullah made his surrender to Government shortly before his death. By his untimely end, the British Administration lost a very valuable man. Of his murder, more will be mentioned later. Attached hereto as “Appendix A.” is a map of the Gharraf showing tribal boundaries; attached also, as Appendix B., is a list of all tribes in this district. Of the general situation little need be said. The tribes are well organised, and on the whole very well behaved. (b) Al Humaid .—Head Shaikh, Mohan al Khairullah. General. —x4I Humaid, who occupy the left bank of the Ghairaf, are kept veil in order by Mohan, who has to a very great extent inherited his father’s character. The wonderful respect which the Gharraf had for Yusuf al Khairullah has made it possible for his son Mohan to step in as head shaikh without any opposition whatso ever. Mohan is an exceptionally capable young man, and is managing the affairs of Al Humaid admirably. One or two attempts were at first made by his uncles to get the power into their own hands, but the attempts ceased as soon as it became evident to all that Mohan was the man chosen by Government. Al Khuwailid .—This section of the Al Humaid still remain outlawed. They were responsible for the murder of Yusuf al Khairullah, which was committed in a most cunnincr manner. One night Yusuf was sitting out in the open with a gathering of his own shaikhs when a runner brought him a letter. The matter appeared to be one of urgency, so a lamp was called for. This was brought and Yusuf bent down to read the letter. While he was reading, three shots rang out and each found its billet. Enquiries proved without doubt that Haji Bizi al Harchan, Rais of the Khuwailid, was responsible. Al Shuwailat (Yusuf’s own tribe) rose, and Al Khuwailid , fled to Khaiyun al TJbaid for protection. Mohan wrote to Khaiyun threatening to attack the ‘Abudah unless Haji Bizi was given up. Khaiyun refused to give him up, and preparations were being made for a battle when Khaiyun received an°order from Major Dickson to banish Al Khuwailid from the ‘Abudah territory. Khaiyun immediately complied with his order, and Al Khuwailid remain outlawed to this day. I have attempted at different times to persuade Mohan to accept fash This he refuses to do. He would take no revenge if Khuwailid returned to their lands unless he were given permission; but he will not lower himself, as he puts it, to accept fash.394 ) Suraijiyin .—A considerable amount of trouble has been caused in the past by this tribe. It is situated between QaFat Sikar and Hai, and hundreds of murders and robberies have been committed within its borders. The Suraifiyin own a very valuable muqata‘ah known as A1 Fahawah. For years A1 Maiyah, one of the Rabkah tribes, in fact the first tribe across the Muntafiq boundary, had cast longing eyes on this muqata‘ah. Last year they caught the Suraifiyin in a divided state, and took advantage of the fact by driving them out of the muqata‘ah. A1 Maiyah built a tower, made a new channel, and put a great deal of work into their newly acquired territory. The result was that this year’s harvest was an exceptionally fine one. Meanwhile the Suraifiyin had been quietly consolidating and preparing for battle. Their idea was to wait until the harvest was over and then attack A1 Maiyah before the grain was winnowed. Just then Government came along, and the Suraifiyin, too frightened to attack, were forced to lodge a formal complaint against A1 Maiyah. For some time the atmosphere was decidedly electric, but at last a settlement was effected. The Suraifiyin were prepared to pay compensation for all improvements carried out by A1 Maiyah. The only thing they asked was for ‘Abdullah ibn Muhammad al Yasin, Shaikh of A1 Maiyah, to take an oath as to the amount expended on the improvements. This for a long while ‘Abdullah refused to do, but a ruling was obtained from Basrah and at last he swore that his expenses were £T500/-, 60 taghars barley and 15 taghars wheat. The compensation w as eventually fixed at Rs. 20,000/-, which the Suraifiyin paid up without a murmur. A majlis was sent out to divide up the grain and the Suraifiyin returned to # their muqata‘ah. Guarantees of good behaviour for six months w-ere taken from both Al Maiyah and the Suraifiyin. Al Toqiyah .—A certain amount of trouble has been caused between Al Mushlib and Shaikh ‘Atiyah over the division of their muqata‘ahs. It was a case of talyah. Shaikh ‘Atiyah has had a strip of land as talyah for years, but the arrange ment was purely between themselves. The actual owner of the land knew nothing about it. This year the division of the land has been different from previous years and Al Mushlib, finding Shaikh ‘Atiyah in a weaker position than heretofore, have attempted to divide up the talyah as well. There is no reason why Shaikh ‘Atiyah should have this strip of talyah, but I considered it advisable to direct that for this year only the previous arrangement shall stand. After the harvesting of this winter’s crop, this question should be brought up again and the muqata‘ahs fairly divided. Otherwise there maj^ be trouble. When this district w r as first opened up, the Toqiyah were responsible for a nightly fusillade into the towm of Qal‘at Sikar. Strong measures were taken, however, and since then the Toqiyah have more or less behaved themselves. Al ‘Attab .—This tribe is in a rather curious position. It is one of Al Flumaid confederation; but not only does it border on ‘Abudah territory—it actually occupies a portion of Khaiyun al ‘Ubaid’s muqata‘ah, the Sudaifir. The Shaikh of Al ‘Atab lives in this portion. So he really lives in Shatrah district, while his tribe comes under the jurisdiction of Qal‘at Sikar district. The question is not yet settled, but is being dealt with. (c) Bani Richab .—No head shaikh at present. General. —Miz‘al al Shati was appointed head shaikh of Bani Richab, but his appointment was not a success. Miz‘al is exceptionally slow and stupid. He is, I am convinced, more fool than knave. I have just received a madhbatah from the various shaiks of the Bani Richab, asking for the appointment of Haji Manna‘ al Shati as their head shaikh. This appointment is well worth considering, for Haji Manna‘ is very influential and intelligent. He is, I believe, quite capable of handling the whole of the tribe, which Miz‘al certainly is not. The Bani Richab occupy the right bank of the Gharraf, and extend down to within a few miles to Shatrah. Albu Ghuwainim .—This tribe, as a tribe, gives no trouble, but the Shaikh’s family seem to be always in difficulties. Up to a year or so ago, the shaikh of the tribe was Hammadi al Shati—an exceptionally rich man, who was a great friend of Yusuf al Khairullah. During the latter years of Hammadi’s lifetime his elder sons were constantly away from home taking part in the wars, of which there were plenty in those days. His eldest son Miz‘al, though singularly devoid of brains, seems nevertheless to have been no coward, for he always led the Albu Ghuwainim inbattle if Hammadi was not present. He was engaged in one of his frequent battles when Hammadi died. Miz‘al returned home to find his father’s colossal wealth in the hands of his youngest brother Hallamah. To this day the question of the division of Hammadi’s wealth has not been settled. Strange to say, Miz‘al seems to have taken no steps to secure his share of his father‘s estate, so Hallamah used this wealth to secure popularity. The Arab invariably follows the man with the money. So Hallamah last year found himself in a position to take half of each of the two Albu Ghuwainim muqata‘ahs in his own name. They had previously been held in Miz‘al’s name. There is no doubt he would soon have turned his eldest brother out altogether. This year it was directed that the whole of the two muqata‘ahs should be dhamand in Miz‘al’s name, and that he should divide up the muqata‘ahs as they had been divided up in Hammadi’s lifetime. Then, both Miz‘al and Hallamah began to play the fool. Hallamah rushed off to the two mallaks and made a dhaman with them as he had done last year; and Miz‘al immediately set about turning out tribesmen who had tilled the ground for years. He very nearly caused serious trouble. Only Haji Manna’s influence kept the tribesmen quiet. Both these gentlemen, Miz‘al and Hallamah, have been suitably dealt with, and the case has, after a colossal amount of trouble, been settled. Among the sanads and guarantees taken was one to the effect that, as soon as possible, both Miz‘al and Hallamah are to proceed to Najaf and there settle the disposal of Hammadi’s property in accordance with Saiyid Kadhim al Yazdi s decision. This should be watched, for Hallamah will back out of this if he is given half a chance. Al Hatim. —-This tribe, which is situated just over the ‘Abudah’s borders, has a thoroughly bad reputation. It is known as a tribe of murderers and robbers, and its members are encouraged in lawlessness by their shaikhs. The strongest man in the tribe, and I suppose the biggest scoundrel, is ‘Ubaid al Qatran. On one occasion he practically exterminated the Manna 4 family, and it is a great wonder that ‘Abdul Karim and Zamil al Manna 4 are alive to-day. On the two occasions when labour was demanded, ‘Ubaid managed to place difficulties m the way and had to be severely dealt with. This tribe should be watched, for they are a long way from Qal‘at Sikar and need a firm hand. (d) Bani Sa‘id.—The northern elements of this tribe, Al ‘Isa, Al Bazzun, Al Muraiyan and Al Durai 4 , are supposed to come under this district, but they are actually fallahin of the Azairij and Albu Muhammad, and so come under the ‘Amarah Division. There will, I am convinced, be no effective control o\er the Bani Sa‘id until a British officer can be spared to devote the whole of his time to this—the Bani Sa‘id Division of the Muntafiq. 3. Revenue: (a) Land Revenue. —It was not possible to collect any revenue on the last winter crop, as the administration of this district was not commenced until the harvest was over. This coming crop should, however, yield a considerable revenue. It has not been decided how this revenue will be assessed. One suggestion was that the assessment should be based on the amount of the mallaks dhuman, but I am not in favour of the idea. I consider it would be better to reverse the or q er to take a Government khars and let the mallaks collect their mallakiya on Government figures. I am afraid the khars will be the only method of assessment until a really good ground survey is available. A list 'is g attached hereto (Appendix C.) showing the muqata ahs of this district. (b) Miscellaneous and Special Revenues— (1) ‘Araq. There is no sale whatsoever of ‘araq in this district. The inhabitants are all Muhammadans. . / 9 \ pioi p ax This was collected for the first four months of the administration of this district and was then abolished. It realised Rs. 40/- only per mensem. (3) Tobacco IVr.-Has not yet been established, but I propose issuing licences to all tobacco shops and hawkers for the last half-year at the usual fees. (4) Balam Registration.—No registration was possible before the subsiding of the flood in July. Registration is commencing just now, for the water has only just come down the Gharraf. 4 Irrigation.—T here is no large irrigation project in this district, but there are always a hundred and one questions concerning canals of greater or lesser importance, which demand settlement.396 The following are two of the many cases which have been brought to my notice:— {a) The canal made last year by A1 Maiyah for A1 Fahawah muqata‘ah {see previous note under heading Suraifiyin) takes off in A1 Maiyah territory and passes through the lands of one Hasan Zuraiji, before reaching A1 h ahawah muqata ah. When the Suraifiyin commenced cleaning out the canal, Hasan Zuraiji objected on the ground that water flowing through his lands would flood them and destroy his crops. A sanad has been taken from the Suraifiyin to the effect that they will make good any damage caused by this canal. (b) A muqata‘ah known as the Hamirah can be watered by one of two canals: the Qarmat Shurwah or the Umm al Tamr. The Hamirah muqata ah is inland and lies behind two other muqata‘ahs, each fed by one of the above-mentioned canals. The Qaimat Shurwah was made by Yusuf al Khairullah, and was taken through Ibrahim Beg’s property without the latter’s consent, in order to prevent the risk of his own muqata‘ah being flooded by supplying water to the Hamirah muqata‘ah from his own canal, the Umm al Tamr. Now Ibrahim Beg has taken a sanad from Mohan to the effect that the latter will keep the Shurwah bunded and not allow water down to the Hamirah. Mohan likewise wishes to keep the Umm al Tamr closed. The result was that the Hamirah muqata‘ah looked like being left high and dry without any irrigation canal whatever. I have decided to send a com mission of Bani Richab Shaikhs to inspect the canals and report on the likelihood of damage being caused to either of the muqata‘ahs through which these canals flow. It is to be hoped that very shortly the Irrigation Department will be able to deal with such cases as these, for very often all that is required is the taking of a few levels. It will, no doubt, be some time before the Irrigation Department can take over the regulation of all these small canals. This control is much to be desired, for at present water is either taken off indiscriminately and wasted, or else one man refuses to let another man have water because of the fear of damage to his own crops. 5. Agricultural.— There is not a great deal to report under this heading. The majority of the crops grown in this district are winter crops and the muqata‘ahs are very rich ones, indeed. There has been no attempt made to improve the crops. No new seed has been available. Agricultural loans up to Rs. 20,000/- have been sanctioned for cleaning out canals, purchase of ploughs, and the general improvement of the various muqata‘ahs. The early rain this year proved an unexpected boon. Ploughing and sowing are still being carried on as energetically as ever and in many muqata‘ahs the work is nearly over. 6 . Municipalities : (a) QaVat Silcar. — General .—Prior to the arrival of an Assistant Political Officer in Qahat Sikar the affairs of the town were managed by Shaikh ‘Atiyah. He kept the town clean, and as far as possible peaceful. He is a strong man, and, like Khaiyun in Shatrah, levied and collected any taxes to which he considered he had a right. Thus he is still cordially hated. However, he kept order, and great praise is due to him. The population of the town is a strange one—entirely Shi‘ah. Half of the population are Arabs and the other half Kurds. Improvements .—As in Shatrah, the great work of the year has been the building of a town wall. Here too, strangely to report, a passive opposition was experienced. This veiled hostility was no doubt caused by the merchants, who could see that with the wall surrounding the town it would be possible, should occasion arise, to control all merchandise. This opposition has, I am pleased to report, entirely disappeared, and the merchants now know for the first time in their lives what it means to live free from the constant anxiety of tribal raids. The town has now two very fine gates and two watch towers. As there is water at Qahat Sikar all the year around it has not been considered necessary to build any wall on the right bank of the Gharraf. A very fine market place has been built, in which the tribeswomen are able to sell their produce. This is greatly appreciated. Crime .—There has been exceptionally little crime in the town, an occasional robbery being all that has disturbed the peace.Telegraph Office.—Owing to the shortage of man-power, the military telegraphists were withdrawn at the beginning of September, and a telephone with a connection on to the Kut exchange was installed. The arrangement has worked quite well. CJp to the present Qahat Sikar and Shatrah remain unconnected. Qal‘at Sikar is in telephonic communication with Hai and Kut, while Shatrah has a telegraph line to Nasiriyah. Post Office .—An extra-departmental post office was opened about the middle of December. The political office head clerk officiates as postmaster in addition to his ordinary duties. A tri-weekly postal service has been instituted between Qal‘at Sikar and Shatrah, by means of the Muntafiq Horse. Up to the present the arrangement has been working quite well. V, (b) Karradi .—The cleanliness of Karradi is due to the energy of Yasir, one of the Muntafiq Horse Squadron Commanders. When first I visited Karradi, in April of this year, the filth was revolting and the lack of interest pitiful. On returning in June I found everything altered. The contrast was as striking as it was pleasing. Yasir had worked like a Trojan. The bazaar and streets were thoroughly cleaned, shelters had been built for shops, deep pits were being filled in and the whole atmosphere of the town had undergone a complete change. Then, and afterwards in Qahat Sikar, Yasir’s work was excellent and 1 have much pleasure in placing his good work on record. Shortly after my arrival Shaikh Hamid al Soz was appointed Mudir of Karradi and has worked well. He naturally attempted to extend his influence beyond the town, but this was only to be expected, as his tribal influence is considerable. It was pointed out to him that Karradi alone came under his jurisdiction and no further trouble was experienced. Shaikh Hamid has continued the good work commenced by Yasir and the town is wonderfully clean. Karradi has been organised as a proper baladiyah with its mukhtars, police, sweepers, rates, and taxes, and other benefits of a township. The shops and houses have all been numbered, and on my last visit I found Shaikh Hamid busily engaged in strengthening and heightening the bund along the river front. This work was of urgent necessity and has been well carried out. (c) Suwaij Shijar .—On two occasions last June I attempted to visit Suwaij, but each time my launch broke down and the attempt has been given up. On the day of my departure for Shatrah I temporarily appointed Shaikh ‘Atiyah’s son as Mudir on probation. I afterwards found that the lad was useless and his appointment could not be confirmed. Suwaij now boasts of a baladiyah organisation with one Saqban as rais baladiyah. Saqban is a very capable man, and takes a keen delight in keeping the small town scrupulously clean. 1 was much struck, on my last visit, by his keenness. Saqban deserves every encouragement. Suwaij Shijar will grow considerably on account of its being the junction of the various caravan routes. Caravans from Hai, Persia, ‘Amarah and Shatrah all call at Suwaij before proceeding across the desert to Ifaj en route for Najaf and Karbala. While at Suwaij I was astonished to see the number of corpses which were being brought into tne town. Generally these corpses are deposited in the town for a night or so before being taken on to Najaf. This did not strike me as being a particularly healthy practice, so I immediately ordered the construction of a small mortuary on the outskirts of the town. This is not yet complete. I also noticed a very menacing tower about 400 yards outside the town on the main desert road. Enquiries elicited the fact that this tower was occasionally used by highwaymen as a fine point of vantage from which caravans could be held up. I immediately ordered the demolition of the tower. The wood from its roof provided the material for the roofing of the mortuary. 7 . Judicial. —A town majlis was formed in June last, with Shaikh ‘Atiyah as the leading member. The majlis has done good work and is exceptionally useful as an investigating and advisory body. The majority of the judicial cases are so very closely concerned with tribesmen that the Tribal, Criminal, and Civil Disputes Regulation is invariably followed. If one can judge from the cases disposed of during the last six months, it will be some long while before Civil Court methods can be adopted. At first, cases of murder, robbery and debt—some dating back 50 years—simply poured in; but a ruling was obtained from the Political Officer,Nasiriyah, to the effect that only cases since the British occupation of Baghdad would be dealt with. This eased the pressure considerably. 8 . Education. —There is a great demand for a school in Qal at Sikar, but up to the present it has been impossible to open one. A suitable building is a great difficulty, but suitable schoolmasters are still more difficult to obtain. Two promising youths have already been sent to Baghdad to undergo a course of training there. On the completion of their course they will, it is hoped, return to Qahat Sikar. Only then will it be possible to open a school here. 9. Medical and Sanitation. —There is no Civil dispensary in Qal at Sikar, and the Assistant Political Officer is considered the doctor. He is expected by the populace to provide remedies for all maladies and a good stock of medicines is essential. The tribes suffered heavily from the epidemic of Spanish influenza. A con servative estimate gives the deaths at 40 men and 300 women and children. A vaccinator was sent to Nasiriyah for training and has now returned duly qualified. He has brought with him 'a certain amount of vaccine and has already commenced the vaccination of children. The sanitation of the three municipalities has been thoroughly attended to. Each town has an efficient body of sweepers and the cleanliness of the streets is striking. In Qakat Sikar six incinerators have been built and these satisfactorily dispose of all refuse. 10. Muntafiq Horse. —One squadron is always at QaTat Sikar, and the following outposts are maintained:—Karradi, one chaush and 10 men; Suwaij Shijar, one chaush and five men; Surveyors’ escort, one chaush and 15 men. Exceptionally good work was done by Yasir when first I arrived. He personally supervised the building of the stables, and during my absence he saw that no slackness was allowed to take place on the part of the sweepers, &amp;c. For a long while the policing of the town was in the hands of the Muntafiq Horse. The good work of Jabar should not be forgotten. Jabar is quite a young Squadron Commander, and his squadron is composed of many wild characters from the Suraifiyin and Toqiyah. He keeps them well in hand and has proved of the greatest assistance to the Assistant Political Officer. 11. Town Police. —Qakat Sikar force consists of one chaush, one onbashi, and 12 men, while the strength of Karradi is one onbashi and six men. For a considerable period there was the greatest difficulty in obtaining men. Why this should have been is hard to say. It was only after the mukhtars were ordered to produce guaranteed men that the force was brought up to strength. One of the Shatrah Chaushes is now in Qakat Sikar knocking the Police there into shape. I expect to find a great improvement when next I inspect them. The uniforms have only just been received for the Karradi Police, so these men- cannot be expected to be up to the standard. As soon as the Qakat Sikar men are more or less trained I intend sending the Chaush instructor to drill the Karradi men for a fortnight or so. 12. Labour. —Two large demands have been made on the Qakat Sikar tribes, and in each case the demands were met, though with considerable difficulty. Five hundred men worked at Sayih until their allotted task was completed, and 2,000 men came down to Shatrah and worked well on the irrigation project there for about 12 days, also finishing the work set them. The fact that these tribes, living in some cases 70 miles away from Nasiriyah, were persuaded to work at Sayih (6 miles beyond Nasiriyah) speaks exceptionally well for their settled condition and amenability to law and order. G. A. Haysom, Captain, (Officiating) Assistant Political Officer, Qal‘at Sikar. Copy to— ( 1 ) The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, through the Political Officer, Nasiriyah. (2) The Political Officer, Nasiriyah Division, Nasiriyah.Administration Report of the Nasiriyah District for 1918. 1. Political and Tribal.— As I have been in charge of the district for only one month, and as the amount which I know about it is infinitesimal compared with the Political Officer’s knowledge of it, I shall not attempt to say anything under this heading. The only case of any importance which I have had to deal has been a dispute between Haji Muhalhil of the Ibrahim and Rudani of the ‘Asachrah. This has been settled. 2. Revenue : (a) Land Revenue. —This is the first time since the British occupation that Shitwi has been collected in this district. Crops’ estimation was carried out in April, and the revenue demand was equivalent to one-tenth of the crop. The amount realised was Rs. 44,664/8/8/. The estimation for saifi was made in October, and the demand amounts to the value of one-fifth of the crop. The demand amounts to Rs. 5,845/12/6; it is being collected. As regards date revenue, I understand that a count of date-trees was made in 1917. Demands for revenue were made out according to the count. The revenue this year amounted to Rs. 15,489/11/-. Figures have been given me purporting to account for the number of gardens and date-trees in the district. According to these figures, there are 287 date gardens, containing 81,343 trees. Of these, 74 gardens, containing 20,808 trees, are ‘Ammar; 213 gardens, containing 39,568 trees, are Kharrab, and 20,967 trees are reported as being “ non-bearing.” If, however, 74 ‘Ammar gardens, which pay revenue at the low rate, contain 20,808 trees, it seems strange that 213 Kharrab gardens, which pay at the higher rate, should contain only 39,568 trees. Although the number of Kharrab gardens is three times the number of ‘Ammar gardens, yet the number of trees in them is less than twice the number in the ‘Ammar. It would also seem that an excessively high number of* trees have been classed as “ non-bearing.” The rates of tax are 5 annas per tree in Kharrab gardens, and 2 annas 6 pies on trees in ‘Ammar gardens. The following table shows the development of these three sources of revenue since 1915 :— f 1915-1916. 1916-1917. 1917-1918. 1918-1919. Shitwi .... Saifi ----- Date ----- RS.

(d) Miscellaneous ami Special Revenues : ‘Araq .—The contractor paid Rs. 15,000/- this year as against Rs. 9,500/- last year. The amount paid to Government should still further increase next year. Opium. —This brought in Rs. 400/-, as against Rs. 270/- last year. The import and sale of opium requires greater supervision than it at present obtains. Fish Tax .—This amounted to Rs. 14,000/-, as against Rs. 6,550/- last year. FLodah Tax. This has been in abeyance for the' last two years, but is to be revived from 1st January 1919. Vegetable Tax.—This brought in Rs. 1,887/- up to May. It was then abolished.403 Tobacco Ta#.-—This is levied at the rate of Rs. 7 /- per shop; Rs. 3/8/- per hawker. There are at present 87 shops and 17 hawkers’ licences, bringino- in Rs. 1,267/- up to the end of December. g ° Salt Tax .—Up to the end of December this brought in Rs. 1,143. It is beinv abolished with effect from the end of the year. g Boat Registration. —Brought in Rs. 3,487/- up to the end of December as compared with Rs. 1,732/-. Stamps. —Rs. 2,357/-, as against Rs. 1,158/- last year. The total revenue this year amounted to Rs. 1,05,541, as compared with Rs. 39,355/- last year. (e) Customs. —Nil. (f) Compensations. —-Nil. 3. Irrigation. —As far as irrigation is concerned, the chief work of importance is the building of a bund on the Bad‘ah and the diversion of the water southward into the territory of the Ibrahim and Azairij. The work has not been carried out on the scale intended by the District Irrigation Officer, owing to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient labour, but it is expected to bring down a considerable quantitv of water. The other work of importance is the Sayih Canal. This was made with the object of carrying water to the railway. It is of importance for irrigation also, and provides water for the A1 Ghazzi through whose territory it flows. 4. Agriculture.—I asked the A.C.O. for a note on the agriculture of the district. He has sent me a note on vegetable-growing, a copy of which has been sent direct to you. He does not say anything about the crops. 5. Municipality-: (a) Officers. —The following officers were in charge of the municipality during the year under report:— Capt. Fletcher. Capt. Suter. Capt. McDermott. Lieut. Orgill. Rushdi Effendi. (b) Works. —The two chief works completed during the year are the Women’s Market and the Bullock Lines. A certain amount of work was done also towards levelling and clearing up of roads. Much more of such work might have been done had finances permitted. (c) Finances. —Owing to the fact that large bills were sent in for rations consumed by B.O.R.s and I.O.R.s attached to the municipality, and bv the bullocks used for sanitation purposes; owing also to the fact that large refunds were demanded from municipal funds for the benefit of civil revenues, the finances of the municipality were not in a favourable position. Application has been made to the Civil Commissioner, however, for the refund to the municipality of certain sums paid for the benefit of the Civil Administration. If this refund is granted, it will put the municipality on its feet again. The other activities of the municipalities are dealt with under the headings Education, Sanitation, &amp;c. 6 . Judicial. —The following cases were dealt with during the nine months from April to December 1918 :— Civil cases ------- 430 Criminal - - - - - 60 Muhammadan law - - - - - -272 Application for passes ..... 32 $ Miscellaneous ------ 694 Tribal cases settled - - - - - - 127 7. Education. —There is one primary school in Nasiriyah, with a staff of three masters and two religious teachers. At the commencement of the year there were 48 boys on the rolls; there are now 126. Between January and April there was a steady increase in the number of boys attending the school, but after the latter month the numbers decreased, owing to the abolition of religious education. This has been reintroduced and the numbers have again increased. During the year the Directorate of Education was established. The Director himself came down on tour from Baghdad in December and visited the school. E e 2404 There has been a great improvement in the control and the organisation of the school during the last part of the year. Until about three months ago there were no proper syllabuses, and consequently the classes were working upon no definite lines. This has been changed, and syllabuses have now been issued in Arabic for the various standards. Like all other schools, this school is in need of more staff, more desks, more books. The need of staff will gradually be supplied by men passing out of the new Teachers’ Training School at Baghdad. Desks and books will be supplied as opportunity and finance permits. The expenditure on the school for the last nine months amounted to Rs. 3,790/—. The amount realised in fees was Rs. 199/—. 8. Medical and Sanitation : (a) Civil Hospital and Town .— 'Total attendance during the year - - - - 46,200 Total fresh attendances ------ 17,392 Daily average, all cases- - - - - * - 15,132 Indoor patients admitted during year - - - - 278 As will be seen from the figures quoted above, the hospital is popular with the inhabitants of Nasiriyah. This is very largely due to the personality of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Rai Sahib Dev Raj. The hospital is now well equipped with stores and instruments. (b) Sanitation .—During the year the town has been well equipped with latrines and incinerators of the bee-hive pattern, and covered sheds for the accommodation of bhoosa have also been built near most incinerators. The last two items enable sanitary work to be carried on effectively in the wet weather. This was not possible when the incinerators v r ere all of the open type, and there was no covered storage rooms for bhoosa. At the end of the period under report the B.O.R.s and Indian Sanitary Staff, together with most of the S. and T. bullocks which were previously in the use of the Municipality, have been returned to the base. Sanitary work is now carried out with an Arab staff, and by means of donkeys and donkey boys. (c) Health .—The health of the town has been good on the whole. There has been no outbreak of cholera; but there was an epidemic of gastro-enteritis in September. There was also an outbreak of influenza. Neither of these resulted in many deaths. There is a certain amount of small-pox always prevalent in the town, and efforts are being made to persuade people to be vaccinated themselves and let their children be vaccinated. Lymph for vaccination is now being made locally in the laboratory of the hospital. 9-13. Police and Shabanahs. —(a) I have nothing particular to note under these heads. The Police were put under the control of Lieut. Hall, Officer Com manding Muntafiq Horse, in October last, and this has both worked towards efficiency and towards diminishing the feeling that previously existed between the Police and the Sowaris. (b) Establishment .—As regards establishment, I should like to bring to notice the good work done by Sergt. Baker in the Municipal Office as accountant. He is fit to occupy a more responsible and better paid position than that which he occupies at present. I also wish to mention the name of Mr. H. A. Lobo, the Accountant in Assistant Political Officer’s office, who is as hardworking and reliable an officer as one could possibly wish; and who has coped single-handed, for a long period, with heavy pressure of work; and of Muhammad Ramzan Khan, until lately Head Clerk and now Mudir Mai, who has done very valuable work. I recommend both these officers for advancement whenever the occasion arises. (Signed) T. C. Orgill, Lieut., Assistant Political Officer, Nasiriyah. Nasiriyah, 31st December 1918. (No. 2016 A.P.)

The district is inhabited by the following tribes :— Budnr^ HuSainat; (2) A1 Ghazzi ’ ( 3 ) A1 Ibrahim; (4) A1 Azairij; (5) A1 The first four tribes are under Assistant Political Officer, and the last is under the Political Officer of the Division. • ii ?’ II EV ^ NIJE Collection.—T here are the following sources of general revenue in this district:— o &amp; n u crop (collected this year only); saifi; dates; ‘araq; opium; fish tax; tobacco; boat registration; stamp; kodah (to be started by 1 st January 1919); salt (abolished from 1 st January 1919). Saifi and Shitwi Crops : Saifi. Crops. —Saifi crops are mash, izrah and simsim, which are not cultivated much, hence the less income. One-fifth of the production is assessed by the Government. Shitwi Crop. Shitwi crops are wheat, barley (dukhan), both being grown on a large scale. One-tenth of the production goes to the Government. This is the first time that shitwi revenue was collected. Assessment is done by estimation of standing crop. Parties of Khawaris are detailed for this work (in October for saifii and in April for shitwi). The party for both crops consisted of :— 1 nadhir; 1 mamur; 1 khatib; 2 amdah; 1 kharus, to whom a remuneration for the work was paid. Though there is no other alternative but to adopt this system till such time as the land is surveyed, nevertheless I would suggest that, when the usual estimation is being carried out, the land under crop be classified :— {a) good crop; ( 6 ) fair crop; (c) poor crop, and taken as standard for revenue assessment. Crops from these three areas will be cut separately, thrashed and weighed in presence of Shaikhs, Sarkal and owner of the crop. On the experiment the assessment may be made for the future. To my mind this would be a system which will provide a check on estimation made by Khawaris as well as being a source of greater revenue. Dates. —This year trees were not counted, but the assessment was made on last year’s counting. The trees are said to vary every year, i.e., a very uncertain yield, and for this reason it seems necessary that the trees be counted every year, thus only actual yielding trees will be assessed and the revenue will fluctuate. There are 287 date gardens, and 13 kinds of dates are produced in Nasiriyah : 1. Khazarawi; 2 . Shawaisi; 3. Dori; 4. Zahdi; 5. Gantar; 6 . Maktun; 7 . Baraim; 8 . Shukkar; 9. Lilwi; 10. UsPamran; 11 . Chib Chap; 12 . Digal; 13. Habsi. Fruits and Vegetables. —Following fruits are produced in this district: Pomegranate (rumman), grapes (‘anab), figs (tin), apricot (mishmish), big orange, sour (dumbalan), sweet and sour orange (numi), oranges (purtugal), kumassrah (armut), apples (tuffah), quince (sifarjal), berries (nabuk), mulberry (tuki). nectarines (khakh). It is said that before the war there were more fruit trees. During the w T ar most of them have been cut by the Government for military necessities. Fruit gardens are not separate, but combined with date gardens. Vegetables, melons, &amp;c., are cultivated freely in the gardens, which are exempt from land revenue. Fodder. —Practically the only kind of green fodder is lucerne (jat) cultivated in gardens. This is grown extensively and very much liked by the animals. It is x TO 1162—1 E e 3said that, if it is once sown and properly looked after, the yielding of lucerne will last for five or seven years. Secondly, khasil (qasil) green crop of barley and wheat. Thirsly, achrish (grass) green grass in hot weather. Trees. —Following trees are found in Nasiriyah district:—Gharab, Sufsaf, and Isal (all in gardens); Tarfah, Shank, and Qawaq (all in maidans), which are proportionately few. There is a great scarcity of firewood trees and it would be a good thing to start arboriculture and a small forestry of Indian trees, such as Shisham, Ivikar, &amp;c., which need little care and bring much profit. Excise : ‘Araq. —It is given out on annual contract to one person, who does both the manufacturing and selling of it. There is no still head duty, and a bottle of ‘araq is still sold at Rs. 5/-. It is expected that an increment in revenue would be got if a separate retail shop were opened, in addition to the present one, without any restriction. (The present restriction is not to sell more than one bottle). There is no supervision on still nor any proper record of the quantity of ‘araq manufactured during the month. Opium. —This is given on farm. The import of opium is from Persia. The contractor receives the opium from the importers direct, without giving any know ledge to the Revenue officials. All imports and delivery to the contractors should be through the A.P.O.’s office, Revenue Branch. Irrigation. —In Nasiriyah district there are about 50 big and small canals, in existence since the Turkish times. The irrigation is mostly by flow, gardens (especially) by lift. Following methods of irrigation are adopted :— Flowing water; na‘ur (Persian wheel); karad; daki; pumps; Pumping engines are very much desired by the Shaikhs. Lands. —It is said that there are only two kinds of lands—miri and mamluk. 4. Education. —In the tribes there is no education. All are illiterate. If there is any, it is limited to Quran-reading to children in Mosque. 5. Agriculture. —During last year 54 tons and 18 mds. of wheat and 57 tons 6 mds. of barley seeds were advanced to the . Shaikhs. Partly it was recovered in kind and partly in cash. This year up to the end of 1918, 20 tons 2 mds. of Basrah wheat and 70 tons 19 mds. of Karun wheat have been advanced to the Shaikhs by the Agriculture Officer through the A.P.O. 6 . Establishment. —Up to November 1918 the Revenue staff consisted of :— 1 Revenue clerk, 1 Revenue assistant clerk, 1 tahsildar (for about two months). From December 1918, sanction was obtained for entertainment of a Mudir Mai (Revenue assistant to A.P.O.) and two Tehsildars. To the former post M. Muhammad Ramzan Khan, H.C., to A.P.O., has been appointed, and the entertain ment of two Tahsildars are to be considered next month from among good honest local Arabs. The appointment of Mudir Mai will relieve the A.P.O. of a great portion of the Revenue work (Supervision of Revenue establishment, to collect and check Revenue accounts and to furnish A.P.O. with knowledge of local conditions in Revenue matters). Also it will enable the A.P.O. to devote more of his time to tribal affairs. The defects as mentioned above will be greatly remedied by the appointment of Mudir Mai.

Administration Report for the Qadha of Kifri since its occupation (May 1918) to December 31st 1918. the qadha or qaimmaqamliq oe kifri. 1. Its Geographical Situation and Boundaries— The Qadha of Kifri is found in the corner formed by the meeting of the Jabal Hamrin range and the Diyalah River—the south-eastern limits of the vilayat of Mosul. In the Turkish administration, Kifri was a Qadha of the Kirkuk Sanjaq and was separated, geographically, from the Kirkuk Qadha by a line drawn roughly from the Jabal Hamrin at Hor al ‘Adhaim to halfway between Tuz and Tauq—(Quru Chai) and continued, along tribal boundaries, a little to the north of the Aq Su to Ibrahim Khanji. This line, continued eastward to meet the Diyalah just below Pivas, divided the Kifri Qadha from the Sanjaq governed from Sulaimaniyah. 2. Physical Features —It is a district of rich valleys separated by ranges of hills running from the north-west to the south-east. There are no high mountains. Between the Jabal Hamrin and the range known partly as Jabal Gilabat, partly as Jusbah Dagh, is the Qarah Tappah valley, which in Turk times constituted a nahiyah governed by a mudir at Qarah Tappah. This Jabal Gilabat does not extend to the western limits of the Qadha, leaving a vast plain between the Hamrin and the belt of hills which runs from Diyalah in a north-westerly direction just north of the Kifri-Tuz Khurmatu-Kirkuk road, but as far as it extends forming a second large valley in the Kifri district. North of the Jabal Qamr and Daudah ranges the hills become less regular and there are several small but exceedingly fertile valleys and particularly the great rolling plateau of Sar Qabah-Shakil-Shirwanah. The district is watered ( 1 ) by the Diyalah river, from which water is diverted into irrigation canals; ( 2 ) by a multitude of mountain springs and, in winter, rain torrents, all draining into the larger streams of the Salahiyah and Dolkhanah rivers, eventually, by means of the Narin, reaching the Diyalah near the Hamrin gorge. 3. Climate. —The climate is not much more temperate than that of the plains —in fact, Kifri is probably, in the hot weather, a hotter place than Ba^ubah; but the rainfall is probably much greater. The last fall of snow at Kifri was nine years ago and the poor condition of the date-trees at Tuz Khurmatu and Kifri is ascribed to that severe winter. There are very few date-trees in the Kifri district and practically none north of the district. 4. Minerals. —A coal mine exists at Na Salih, three miles from Kifri. The coal is of poor quality and contains a good deal of bitumen. Coal also exists in other parts of the hills north of Kifri; but no mines, save that of Na Salih, have been worked. Oil crops out at many places in the hills, and the oil well at Tuz is being worked. In the Turkish times a little oil was also obtained from Basha, near Na Salih coal mine. Copper, according to German maps, and according to the people, is to be found north of Kifri. Bitumen is common, and is collected by the people. There are several mines of fullers' earth in the district. It is sent to Baghdad for sale. v Alum, and a salt called “ zagh,” which is possibly, potassium nitrate, are found near the Tuz Khurmatu. Salt pans. Salt, as the name Tuz Khurmatu (“ salt and dates ”) suggests, is to be found near that town. Gypsum (juss) is found and is universally used in Kifri for house-building. Gypsum can also be obtained near Qarah Tappah. Nurah or lime can be made by burning a kind of limestone pebble common in all the river beds.A type of quartz or marble is called “ marmar,” and is used as marble in the houses. Sulphur is not uncommon, and, before the coming of matches, was used to make a kind of match. Silver is said to exist. 5. Fauna and Flora. — {a) The fauna of the district are the usual fauna familiar to us in the plains, except that the camel is not common in the Kifri district, and, in addition to the animals of the plain, there are to be found animals more common to hills and colder climates. The leopard is not unknown: a pair are said to have been seen last May near Kellar on the Diyalah. The black pig is at present very abundant in the forests of the Fiyalah. A large mountain goat—resembling the llama—is found in the hills, and its wool fetches a high price. The wolf, wild cat, fox, and hare are common. Large snakes are found. The Diyalah shelters, besides large fish, a turtle which grows to nearly as large a size as those seen in the larger rivers in India. {b) The flora resemble those of the plains, except that dates do not thrive so well, while vines produce a particularly luscious grape. The vines of Qarah Tappah were famous before the war, but they were cut down by the Turkish soldiery. Fruit trees flourish. A gum root is collected, called “ Arab qozi.” Flowers include the oleander and the hollyhock. 6. Hygiene. — Malaria is the worst and most prevalent disease in Kifri. Kifri town has now the reputation of having a bad climate. During the last hot weather there were several cases of typhoid, typhus, small-pox, and a dangerous epidemic of cholera, besides the universal epidemic of influenza. Venereal diseases are common in the town, but the country-dwellers, especially the Kurds, are free from them. Eye diseases amongst children are common. 7. History. —Little is known of the ancient history of the district, but there are interesting remains in the Diyalah of massive stone causeways, probably used as dams for irrigation purposes. The piers of these are still in good condition and remarkable for. the size and regularity of the stones. Kemains also exist of a huge canal system, when the water was carried over the torrent beds* in massive stone aqueducts. The origin of Kifri is not known, except that the original Kifri was a Kurdish city, the site of which is now marked by the hill called Eski Kifri (old Kifri). To permit water to reach the old town it was necessary to make and keep in repair a great dam in the Salahiyah river. Possibly the inhabitants of the old town became weary of the continual labour on this dam (the remains of which are still to be seen) and abandoned the old site for the new town, close to the water supply. That the old town was probably a rich town is evidenced by the stories of successful excavations for gold ornaments. The word “ kifri ” has nothing whatever to do with the word “ keupri,” a bridge, but has its origin in a kind of tree which was abundant near the old site and whose name is “ kifr.” 8 . Inhabitants. —The dividing line between the Arabs and the Kurds passes through the Kifri district. The greater part of the country-dwellers of the Qarah Tappah district are Arabs, the greater part of those in the Tuz and Kifri districts are Kurds. The majority of the townsmen call themselves Turkomans and there is some reason to imagine that they are the relics of a former migration from the direction of Van. The following is a statement of the inhabitants of the three towns of the district:— Kifri. Tuz Khurmatu. Qarah Tappah. Arab - - - None 14 23 Kurd - - 254 14 Turkoman - - - - - 1,650 1,713 920 Christian - - - - - 1 Jew- _ - - - - 211 200 47 Persian - - - 148 6 122 Total - - - 2,264 1,947 1,112With the big exception of the Jaf tribe, who enter the district for the cold weather, the population of the district may he said to be wholly sedentary. Excluding the Jaf, the population at present probably numbers between twenty-six and twenty-eight thousand. The Jaf possibly number between two and three times this number. There are three towns in the Kifri district, each constituted as a municipality. Most of the houses in Kifri and Tuz Khurmatu are built of stone and gypsum mortar. The roofs are built without iron or wooden supports of any kind. Grypsum arches are first made on the ground and left to dry. Then tbey are erected at intervals on the walls and the space between them built in of stones and gypsum. Such houses must be carefully re-covered with mud annually before the rains, which are other wise liable to soak through and cause the downfall of the structure. Bridges are made in the same way. The Qarah Tappah houses are built of mud, with the exception of the Sanniyah buildings and the houses of one or two notables, which are built extraordinarily well of bricks. The Sanniyah buildings were put up 17 years ago. Kifri has always been short of wood either for building purposes or for fuel, and at present wood is almost unobtainable. All the trees, with the exception of a few fruit trees in the gardens of influential notables, were cut down by the Turks. The inhabitants at present use brushwood for cooking and other purposes, or, more generally, charcoal, which is brought in mostly from a Jaf village on the Diyalah and sold at Ks. 6 a load. The lack of wood probably decided the peculiar system of building without its use, except as doors and window frames. Some of the houses display considerable art in decorated stone pillars and doorways and in the use of marble. The best masons come from Kirkuk. They appear to have lost all knowledge of the origin of the masonic signs they have been taught to work. The design of the Kifri house is a good one for the spring and dry weather. In winter the houses are cold and cheerless, and to move from upstairs to downstairs it is necessary in almost every case to go out of the shelter of the house. The inhabitants of the towns are either Government officials, traders or land- owners with a town residence. Outside the towns the inhabitants are entirely cultivators. In some villages, the peasants from several villages are of one tribe and as such accept the authority of the tribal shaikh, fn Sanniyah lands this shaikh does not customarily receive any dues from his followers, but the mukhtar of the Tillage was usually favoured by a light assessment for his services to Government, although even he received no dues from his fallah, except assistance in his house building or reaping operations. In other parts of the district a shaikh landowner is found with a position similar to that of an English squire; he has several villages, generally of his own tribe, but some from other tribes; there are also a few villages owned by townees who have no tribal authority over the peasants. In the Qarah Tappab Sanniyah lands are many villages of mixed inhabitants, who elect a mukhtar and are afterwards responsible to Government for his behaviour. 9. Industries. —In former times cloth of cotton and cloth of wool was woven locally at Kifri. At present there is no such industry. Dyeing is also at present a feeble industry, owing to lack of dyes. The Jaf make carpets of wools dyed with dyes obtained from Persia. There are practically no local vegetable dyes, except “ zerdik,” a shrub from which is extracted a yellow dye. Stockings are knitted of wool by local women. There are really no industries peculiar to Kifri, save those of the Jaf women, who make carpets and saddle-bags. There are no brick kilns. The mountain streams are utilised to mill grain. The flour mills are distinguishable by their minaret-like towers, from the top of which the mill-man may shout when he is ready for another customer, and also keep off thieves. Gypsum-preparing and lime-burning are local industries, which fell into abeyance during the war. 10. Trade.— The district of Kifri produces and exports, in ordinary times, large quantities of the following : — Horses (pack), mules, donkeys. These are bred and sold by the Jaf tribe and exported in all directions. Sheep and goats. As above.416 Hides and skins. These are exported to Baghdad. .Dibn or ghi is exported to Baghdad and is thence exported by sea. Wool, both Arabi and Kurdi, is extensively exported to Baghdad. A kind of llama goat wool is also exported. Several different kinds of carpets and saddle bags are exported. The following articles are imported and exported south :— Tobacco from Sulaimaniyah, a special kind or rice (zerdelikao) from Sulaim- maniyah, walnuts, pears, gum, grapes, raisins, dried mulberries from Sulaimaniyah, cigarette papers from, Mosul. Pullers’ earth, Arab cozi, Arab tents are exported to Baghdad. Imports from other districts include dates from Mandali, cotton goods and groceries from Baghdad, pomegranates and oranges from Ba qubah, silks from Persia. 11. Currency. —With the exception of the golden lira (now worth Bs. 18/8- in Kifri) the Turkish currency has disappeared. There was difficulty at first over the currency, which was alleviated by putting in the bazaar a sufficiency of Indian small coinage. 12. Weights and Measures. —Wheat and barley is measured by the waznah of 60 Stambul okes and rice by the manu of 10 Stamboul okes. Cotton is measured by the Aleppo yard. 13. Communication and Transport.— The caravan route from Baghdad is via Dali ‘Abbas, the Sakaltutan Pass, Qarah Tappah to Kifri. Prom Baghdad to Kirkuk the route branches to the east at Kami Kupri and joins the main road again at Tuz Khurmatu. Prom Kifri to Khanaqin is via the Dakkah ford. The recognised crossings of the Diyalah in winter are by kelik at the following places :—Qizil Robat (on the Mandali-Qarah Tappah route), Shaikh Babu, Dakkah, Kani Masi, Khidu. Prom Kifri to Sulaimaniyah, the caravan route is counted as 3| days’ journey, the stages being Ibrahim Khanji, Kirpachinah, Timar. This is a difficult track, even for mules, and impossible for carts and camels. It is little used at present owing to shortage of grain and fodder at the stages. The alternative route is via Tuz, Tauq, Lailan, Chamchamal (6 days). The route to Halabja is by the Diyalah. Transport at present is very scarce, practically all that exists coming from the Khalis or from Kirkuk or Sulaimaniyah. The present rates of mule hire are Rs. 5 per day. General Political Aefairs during British Administration. 1 . Officers. —Capt. R. W. Bullard, C.I.E., arrived at Kifri on May 3rd, a few days after the capture of the town, and took up his duties as P.O. He left for Kirkuk on May 9 th, leaving Capt. R. P. Jardine in charge. Capt. S. H. Longrigg, A.P.O Tuz, reached his post on May 9th. Capt. Bullard returned to Kifri after the evacuation of Kirkuk and returned to Baghdad at the end of July; Capt. S. H. Longrigg was transferred to A.P.O., Kirkuk, and handed over the nahiyah of Tuz Khurmatu at the end of October. Capt. S. A. Wright, M.C., arrived at Kifri in November as assistant to A.P.O., Kifri. 2. Condition of Kifri District.— At the capture of the town, the leading officials had fled and all the records had been removed or burnt. The population of the town consisted almost exclusively of women and children, the men having been taken for military service or run away to avoid it. These women and children were starving : many had had nothing but grass to eat for weeks, and deaths were occurring every day. The bazaar Avas empty ; trade had ceased. The toAvn presented a most dilapidated appearance, for in many cases the doors and window-frames of the houses had been taken by the Turkish troops for fuel, and in others the woodivork had been removed and concealed by the tenants to save it from being stolen, firstly by the Russians, latterly by the Turks. Peeling Avas more bitter against the Russians than against the Turks. Right up to the reoccupation of Kirkuk immigrants continued to leave the Turkish areas for ours. Most of them had determined to get to the Khalis and Baghdad. • Pood relief Avas arranged from Baghdad, and wheat, barley, and dates Avere got up. A Avorkhouse and reception compounds were instituted for the benefit of the starving poor and immigrants, who were fed until able to work fcir their food*417 Both these institutions have now heen abolished., a sum of Its. 400 having been expended to return the inmates to their homes. Vagrancy is now r of small extent being limited to a few immigrants from Sauj Bulaq area. ’ Diseased prostitutes were sent to the lock hospital at Baghdad. o. I ribal. VV e found the tribes in a very different state as to numbers than that described in Soane’s “ Notes.” I do not believe that all the tribes of this district; excepting the Jaf nomads, could collect more than 200 armed horse. After the evacuation of Kirkuk we continued inoccupation of and to administrate the Qadhaof Kifri. This included the Daudah, Zanganah, Baiyat, Dilo, Zand, Palani, Kumrijah, Gezh, and sections of the Jaf and Talabani tribes, A section of the Talabani, under the strong leadership of Sh. Hamid, though outside our defensive line, openly proclaimed themselves our friends and allies, and in return for this w^e showed him marks of special consideration among the chiefs of Kifri district, and at gatherings of chiefs gave him premier position among the chiefs of Kifri, to which he was not perhaps entitled either by birth or natural influence. At any rate, I w r as not allowed to forget that be 'was entitled to this special lionisation only as an appreciation of his alliance with us. The natural leader of the tribes of Kifri is Jamil Beg Baban, and next to him, Karim Beg Jaf is considered in influence. The tribal system of this Qadha is in a state of dissolution—a process fostered by the policy of the Turks since the Hurriyah : in some cases the village headman acknow ledges no one but the Political Officer as his superior. This seems to simplify w ork of revenue collection, but makes administration of justice and law 7 and order more difficult than it is in places where the tribal system persists in its primitive form. In several parts of the district I have managed to maintain the tribal system of responsibility for law and order, but all attempts to maintain it for revenue collection merely led to preposterous delay in its collection or intolerably unfair treatment of the fallah. But in spite of this the tribal system is worth a good trial. A description of the tribes as they exist to-day in the Qadha of Kifri is being given separately. The history of the tribes during our nine months of occupation is very shortly given. On the borders of the Qadha the Talabani under Sh. Hamid were several times engaged in fights with the Turk-inspired Jabbari tribe. An old internal feud in the Zanganah at Ibrahim Khanji broke out again and was patched up by several majlises, but will need a complete settlement. The ‘Azzah made one or two raids from the Dali ‘Abbas district, till one day they got such a sound drubbing from the Baiyat that they have been quiet since. With the exception of the above, the district has heen wonderfully quiet and normal. 4. Be venue : Land Tenure. —The ; following kinds of land tenure are found in this Qadha: — (1) Sanniyah (called Amlak ‘Amiriyah). ( 2 ) Miri Tapu. (3) Set aside for Auqaf. (4) Miri (wuth ‘Uqr set aside for Auqaf). (5) ‘Uqr ( 6 ) Tahrir. I believe no mulk exists apart from houses and buildings. Sultan ‘Abdul Hamid acquired some of the best lands in the Kifri district. In other districts these were called Mudawwarah at the time of the occupation, but in the Kifri district it seems to have gone a stage further, and they are called Amlak ‘Amiriyah by the ex-Sanniyah Mamurs of the three nahiyahs of the Kifri Qadha. Qarah Tappah is wliolly Sanniyah. Kifri nahiyah is half Sanniyah and Tuz Khurmatu is nearly all Sanniyah. One village (Saiyid Lan) in the Qarah Tappah district is Tapu of Jamil Beg Baban, principal notable of the district. The exceptions to Sanniyah in the Tuz Khurmatu district are very small Tapu estates of the Sadah family and of the Dauda chieftains,, and one or tw r o Auqaf estates. That part of the Kifri district which is not Sanniyah is mainly held (Tapu) by the Jaf Beg Zadah family, sons of Muhd. Pasha, chief of whom is Karim Beg-i-Eath U 10 1162—1 F f4d8 Beg-i-Muhd. Pasha, who must he one of, if not the biggest of, the landowners of the Kirkuk Sanjaq. The ancestor of the Talabani tribe, Shaikh Hakim, handed on lands at Qarah Bulaq now cultivated by Shaikh Wahab. Other Tapu estates were acquired by cultivators in small lots, especially round Kifri; but a great many of these have sold their rights to the members of the Baban and Sadah family. Of the third kind, Waqf land, the following rights have been noted :— Kifri District .—Rich lands at Zardao, totalling about 70 faddans, are allotted to the Shaikh ‘Abdul Qadir TVaqfs, Avith particular benefit for the Takiyah at Kirkuk. Both the Government share and the rent of the land are thus allotted. Tuz District .—The rent and Government share of four villages in the Tuz district are allotted to the service of the shrine of Shaikh Muhsin. These are the only instances in which estates are completely set aside for Waqf. Of Miri ground which has remained Miri since the time of Midhat Pasha there is none, save perhaps the small estate at Oniki Imam; one-fourth of the rent and Government share is set aside as Waqf for Oniki Imam. ‘Uqr is title in land, and it is not uncommon in the Kifri district. In some cases the rights of ‘Uqr are set aside as Waqf for particular pious or philanthropic purposes; in others it seems to be an additional right OAvned by the proprietor of the Tapu rights. In most cases it is 2| per cent., hut there are cases of 5 per cent, and of 3 J 0 th. The ‘Uqr is taken from the crop before di^sion. Sometimes called Malikanah. The sixth kind of title in land is one which I have discovered in the Zanganah tribe near Ibrahim Khanji and in the Jaf area at Sar QaTah. It is called tahrir. Apparently it is Miri land for Avhich a Tapu sanad has never been obtained, but for which the occupants paid Wargi assessed on the size of their holdings, and in respect of which they hold an order accepting them as occupants of the land, by proclaiming them liable to Wargi; this order they call tahrir, and regard as a kind of title. I have not yet fully investigated this kind of land title. Land Itevenue : Division of the Crop .—As in ‘Iraq, taxation of land is assessed according to the profits made. There are no exceptions to this in the Kifri district. The division of the crops, however, differs in a peculiar Avay according to the peculiar ease or difficulty with which the crops are irrigated. The Kifri and Qarah Tappah districts have one system and the Tuz nahiyah another system. In the Kifri and Qarah Tappah districts the crops are divided as folloAvs Winter Crops. !8aifi Crops. Net crop, if - - - - Irrigation. Rain. Irrigation. 100 100 100 Government Revenue share - - 10 10 10 Water (landowner) - Landowner’s share (rent) - - - - 10 * — 20 - - - 5 5 20 Turkish cesses - - _ ‘4 4 ' 2 | Peasant cultivator - ” - 82| That is to say, the Government receives from Sanniyah Irrigated 27J, from Sanniyah Daim I7i, from Sanniyah Saifi 52|, from Tapu Irrigated 12|, from Tapu Haim 12^, from Tapu Saifi 12 J. The water share is counted as a return for expense which was incurred, or ought to have been incurred, by the proprietor. From Tuz, however, the shares are similar, except the water share. In the Kifri and Qarah Tappah districts the rent, 5 percent., and the water share, 10 per cent., are both taken by the proprietor of the ground. In the Tuz Khurmatu district there are three systems: (i) that of the Baiyat Muqata‘ah ; (ii) that of the Haudah Muqata‘ah; (iii) that of the town itself. In the case of the Baiyat the water share is taken by the Government from both Sanniyah and Tapu, while in the Haudah and Tuz toAvn it is not imposed at all. The Saifi shares are exactly similar to those of Kifri, except that what few Tapu estates exist are not considered entitled to receive irrigation.419 Tuz Khurmatu Net crop if - - - Irrigated.

Tapu 17! 12! 12! 12! * t Compare with 27| in Kifri and Qarah Tappa] 12 | The only reason one can see for these differences is that— (i) In Kifri and Qarah Tappah the owner of the land has to incur expenses in order to provide irrigation, while in the Baiyat Muqata'ah of Tuz Khurmatu the only expenses are the wages of w r ater watchmen, for which Government takes 5 per cent, water share from sanniyah ; and apparently because the tapu lands are considered not entitled to water, the Government also takes 5 per cent, from the tapu owner. In the nuqata ahs of Daudah and Tuz itself the water (natural streams) is considered as causing neither the tapu owner nor the Government any expenses. (There is very little tapu in the Daudah district.) (ii) The saifi rents and water charges are high, apparently because it is considered that, while the fallah has to labour hard to produce winter crops, and is therefore entitled to large shares, he can produce rice and simsim (the usual crop of this district) without any trouble. AH the fallah need do is to shape his “ marazah ” and sow, and the earth and the w ater provided by the owmer of the ground do the rest. This theory would not work in the case of the Daudah muqata’ahs and Tuz town—wdiere the water is a natural river and an almost natural stream respectively—w r ere it not that in neither are saifi crops of any extent grown. Off saifi crops on tapu lands the owner of the land received 40 per cent, of the crop, and in sanniyah lands the Government received 52J per cent.—more than half the crop. Saifi crops are harvested, the first saifi in May and June, the second saifi in August, September, October. The first saifi is counted for purposes of revenue and rent as a shitwi crop. The reason of this seems to have been that it was sown very early and was ripe for harvest almost as soon as the wheat and that it was too small a quantity to trouble about. Also it was certainly a cheaper crop to produce and did not require, on the part of the tapu owner, so much labour or expenditure on the means of irrigation. This consideration, I feel, is the real reason of the great difference between the shares of winter and saifi crops. The effect of the low rates on winter crops and the high rates on saifi crops must have been to encourage the former and discourage the latter. In actual fact, from this cause or not, the cultivators of this district usually found the winter crop so profitable that many did not trouble to grow' saifi crops, except a little rice and simsim. . . . . * •' : j . ,j ■ .. . . * The rates of taxation and rent are much lower than in ‘Iraq generally, and, although supplemented as elsewhere by Wargi andTamattu, they do not seem to have been more than the country could hear. It is admitted that before the w r ar the peasantry were prosperous and would have been contented had their rulers governed, F f 2Their chief complaints are of unchecked lawlessness among the tribes, disorder, and injustice—or lack of justice. The allegation is too universal to be untrue— that their own chiejs and tribal heads were more tyrannous than their Turkish governors. As most of the chiefs or persons of local influence were allowed by the Turkish Government to farm their followers’revenue, one need not search far for corroboration of the allegation. Included in land revenue are the taxes on vegetables, date-trees, and fruit trees. The former in ‘Iraq are assessed when they are brought to the bazaar or to the municipal ‘alwa for sale and 10 per cent, is taken from the vendor. This custom does not obtain in this district; indeed, has never been heard of. V egetables, if grown in gardens or elsewhere than in river beds, are estimated by eye and 10 per cent, of their estimated sale value collected. If grown in river beds, a system of estimation known as the “ bel ” system is found; this is not found in ‘Iraq. One bel (Turkish for spade) is the area cultivated by one man and this is subjected to a fixed allotment (of 40 q.s. in Turkish times, w r hich increased to 80 q.s.) Date-trees were taxed at 8 annas per fruit-bearing tree. Gardens and fruit trees were in Turkish times assessed at 10 per cent, of the last sale price of the garden. The collection of this tax seemed to have suffered a good deal from the peculations of tahsildars in Turkish times. Collection of Land Revenue under British Administration of Kifri. —From the beginning of the war, cultivation became less and less, and in the year 1917-1918 it was approximately only 8 per cent, of the average pre-war year. At the time of our occupation harvest operations were about to commence, and estimators were at once sent out. After some discussion, it was considered necessary to collect revenue if only to regulate supplies, and orders were passed that for this year the cesses and one-third of the revenue should be remitted. The office was congratulated by the Revenue Board on the speed of collection. The following are the figures for wheat and barley: — Wheat. Shu 4 bah. Demands. Receipts. Outstanding. Kifri - Qarah Tappah - Tuz - 34,982 48,449 87,9391 34,038 43,351 87,939i 944 5,098 Total 171,3701 165,3281 6,042 Shu‘bah. Barley. Demands. Receipts. Outstanding.

The outstandings have now been issued to cultivators as advance of seed. The barley was collected, as shown above, in anbars at Kifri, Qarah Tappah, Tuz Khurmatu. A large proportion of it was then handed over to the military for use for horse rations. (Bhoosa was also collected, on payment, to assist the army.) Barley was also issued to the Mounted Police as horse rations and some issued as seed to cultivators. Wheats'was not brought to shu‘bah headquarters, but left in outside anbars, foi use as seed. The saifi crops, as the shitwi, were estimated by eye. Collection was made in cash, at conversion rates sanctioned by Revenue Board.421 The .tirSt saifi crops were small, as shown by the following figures : — ^ ro P- Government Share.

Fruit Trees .—The ‘ushr on fruit trees realised a total in the Qadha of Rs. 2,608/8/0. ‘Arab Qozi .—Land Revenue tithes are collected in this district from a root called ‘Arab qozi, whose uses are apparently that gum or the stiffening for cotton may be extracted from it. There appears to be a big demand for it at Baghdad. The collection of the tithe was farmed and so far Rs. 1,445 has been realised. Fullers Farth .—The Land Revenue ‘ushr is also collected from fuller’s earth, several mines of which are to be found in the district, and for which there is a large demand at Baghdad. As the earth is cheap, the revenue realised is very small. Tapu .—The Revenue Board asked in July if a Tapu Office could be opened at Kifri and a reply was at first given in the affirmative, as there were at the time two officers at Kifri. The project was temporarily abandoned when Capt. Bullard left Kifri. A register of the houses in Kifri, Tuz and Qarah Tappah was made for the purpose of the assessment and collection of the Municipal house-tax. There is a general desire for a Tapu Office to open, in order that sales of immovable property may be legalised. There is much mortgaged property. No sale of real property has so far been legalised since our occupation. Several have desired to sell real property and obtain my legalisation, but all have become shy when informed that U 10 1162—1 Ff;]422 T could commit myself no further than the witnessing of the sale, without any authentication of title. Tapu disputes have fortunately been few; all that I have heard, I have had to settle by enquiry of the peasants living in the place under dispute. There is likely to he a little friction when the Tapu Office is opened here and enquiries are made into the origin of certain sanads. The Sad ah (sometimes called the Tilishani family of Saiyids) had formerly great influence with the local Government. One of their number, Saiyid Mustafa, was Mamur Tapu. Unfortunately there are not few ugly stories of this man s methods and at least one of his sanads, confirming Tapu rights, would appear after enquiry to have been given on very strange evidence. Waqf: Auqaf Department .—The Auqaf Department offices are at Kirkuk, from the neighbourhood of which a certain amount of income is derived for the Auqaf. From the Kifri district there is no income for the Auqaf Department—if a single case at Qarah Tappah he excepted, where the produce (Gov. share and rent) of three faddans, allotted to the 1 Mosque at Qarah Tappah, is sent to the Auqaf at Kirkuk in return for the regular pay of the Mosque officials. The expenditure in the Kifri district has been so far the salaries of Mosque establishments, hut some of the Mosques are sadly in need of repair and these it is hoped to make next summer. In Turkish times the salaries of Mosque officials were at first paid from sanniyah funds, but since the Revolution they were paid by the Kirkuk Auqaf office. After our occupation they were paid from general revenues and are still being so paid. The following are the Mosques :— Kifri.—Jami‘ al Kabir. Jami‘ as Saghir. Jami‘ Khanaqah. Jami‘ Rashid. Qarah Tappah Jami‘. Tuz Khurmatu Jami*. Kulaju JarnT. Shaikh Baba Jami‘. The total expenditure on salaries comes to about Rs. 350 per annum. The following is a list, eo far as I have been able to discover, of Waqfs in the Kifri district. They are probably all Dhurriyah. Shaikh Muhsin lands near Tuz Khurmatu. Rent and Gov. share set aside for pious object (Imam-shrine of Shaikh Muhsin). Probably 40 faddans cultivable. Oniki Imam, Miri lands near Kifri. One quarter of rent and revenue set aside for service of shrines of Oniki Imam, also produce of one faddan ; lands probably 12 faddans. Shaikh Mahmud. One-tenth of the revenue tithe of 1 faddan in Qarah Tappah district set aside for pious object of Imam service. Ibrahim ‘Adhaim. Similar object. Share and rent of 1 faddan of Qarah Tappah district. Mosque Qarah Tappah. Case mentioned above. Single case of madbatah. Zardao lands. Dedicated to Takiyah of Kirkuk, Qadiri TTaqf. Revenue and rent allotted. In addition to above there are Waqfs Dhurriyah and Mulhaqah of ‘uqr allotted to various pious or charitable purposes. 1. Miscellaneous and Special Revenues. —Turkish Taxes: Wargi .—Wargi was an annual property tax. assessed on the sale value of all property at the time it changed hands last or on the value as assessed by a committee at the following percentages:— House property occupied by owner, 5 per 1,000. House property let by the owner to another, 10 per 1,000. Arable land and gardens, 10 per 1,000. Wargi was levied, as well as on Tapu lands, on the lands described above as Tahrir, and the Wargi receipt is produced by the villagers as their proof to a title. During the war heavy cesses were imposed on both Wargi and Tamattu taxes. Wargi, levied on other than house property in towns, must have been unprofitable and vexatious taxes.Tamattu was levied as in Baghdad. both a^^enUfuL taX 0 ' ?yPSUm (jaSS) W lime (nU1 ' ah) has been disc °vered, though Flour mills were taxed at the ordinary wargi rates. Though we did not collect wargi, except as a Municipal house-tax, we continued to tax flour mills which in most cases use water paid for by the Government or the public. Badal Tariq.^TiiQ Turks also collected badal tariq, a poll tax nominally imposed at a majidi a head on all adults for the upkeep of the roads. The Turks found it difficult, and in the case of the tribes, impossible to collect. This tax also we ignored. Grazing Tax Kodak.—Tha Turks had collected the Kodah for this year in some cases at much increased rates and in kind, and in other cases they had not been able to collect it. We found it possible to collect the balance, Rs. 3,958/8/-. The Kodah was levied here as elsewhere at 4 piastres per head of sheep under three years and 5 piastres per head over three years. Buffaloes, camels, cattle were taxed at 10 q s per head. ’ The main kodah payers of the district are the Jaf tribe. The numbers of the Jaf sheep were never estimated, hut a rough lump sum was assessed on every head of section and a force of about 200 troops was sent annually to the passes at Baneh, Khailan Khan, Gauiah Q,al ah, &amp;c., to intercept their passage north and extract the kodah from them. This year the Lurks tried the same methods to prevent the ingress of the Jafs to our territory. Intoxicants: ‘Araq. The people of Tuz Khurmatu, both Muslims and Jews, are great consumers of ‘Araq. In Kifri and Qarah Tappah it is drunk, as in other places, by the Jews mostly. The monopoly of distilling and selling was farmed separately, one at Tuz Khurmatu, one at Kifri and Qarah Tappah. The Tuz farm made in the time of the Turks was not yet closed. It was contracted in February 1917, for two years ending February 28th, 1919, for piastres 21,100, payable in notes. Of this we have collected Rs. 312/12/-’ The Kifri auction of the farm for live months ending December 31st reached Rs. 500. This has been collected. New auctions were put up for 1919. Public Debt: Salt. —There are large salt pans at Tuz Khurmatu. They had previously been farmed for £T1,100 per annum. When Kifri was occupied the town was without salt except for a small quantity in the Public Debt godown. In contrast with the position in ‘Iraq, the situation of the salt pans at Tuz, and the absence of salt in the district generally, made the continuance of the farm system practicable, and the monopoly right to dig and sell salt at Tuz has been farmed for eight months for Rs. 11,000, one of the conditions being that Kifri shall be adequately supplied. A maximum price of As. 1/6 per kilo for salt sold in the town of Tuz has been fixed. As elsewhere, economy in the collection of taxes allocated to the Public Debt has been effected by entrusting the work to the ordinary Revenue staff, and the Public Debt has ceased to exist as an independent organisation. llegie —Has ceased to exist at Kifri. Customs.—Sto customs house was ever, during our occupation, established at Kifri. A customs mamur and clerk, however, were employed up to the second occupation of Kirkuk, with duties of forwarding tobacco to Baghdad on duty payable passes, and collecting the customs dues on small consignments intended for local consumption. After the armistice and the new Regulations, a Preventive Mamur and a small staff of Preventive Police carried on these duties. Sulaimaniyah tobacco is rarely taken to Altun Keupri for downward transport, Kifri in ordinary times is on the direct route. Owing to the failure of supplies at Ibrahim Khanzi and at Kurpachineh, the route has moved to the route via Chamchamai and Tauq. Compensation. —Owing to the splendid discipline of the troops occupying this area there has been little need for compensation. A little damage Was done to early said crops during the first days of the occupation, but a Court of Assessment was promptly held and damages awarded. The town of Kifri was almost completely occupied for billets during the hot weather. The owners of the houses received the rent assessed by the Municipality. The town as a whole was more than compensatedfor the occupation by the amount of improvements in roads and bridges and in sanitation effected by the Military for their own use, and now left to be enjoyed by the inhabitants (except where canal bridges have been returned to their normal functions of house doors !). 2. Irrigation : District of Kifri .—The district is watered by many spring streams and one or two large rivers, not much use can be made of which for irrigation purposes. The district therefore is mainly either rain lands or irrigated by canals taking off' from the Diyalah. Qarah Tappah District —Is watered by two very large canals, taking off from the Diyalah, where dams are built in a side channel to direct the water, and running side by side till they part -one, the Kashkawil, to water the muqata‘ah of that name on the east of the Kifri-Qarah Tappah road, the Qarah Tappah continuing to irrigate the land to the west of the road. A smaller canal, the Saiyid Lan, runs between these two canals and Avaters a small Tapu estate in the middle of the Sanniyah grounds. The custom in the Sanniyah lands is that repairs must be done by the fallah th(‘inselves without special wages, but any repairs which cannot be so done must be paid for by the landowner,, in this case the Government. At the time of our occupation we found nearly all canals in a state of bad disrepair. The Qarah Tappah and Kashkul canals, tbe former 30 miles in length, were both seen to be sad ruins of their former selves. Arrangements were made to clear the canals sufficiently to irrigate all the land possible to bring under cultivation this year. The Kashkawil canal was also cleaned out. Besides these large canals, there are a dozen smaller ones. The following canals take off from the .Diyalah and water the Baradan district:— Mahmulah, Qizil Arq, Baradan, Bubah, and smaller canals. The following canals take off from the Diyalah and water the Mahnatabad and Xingabad areas : Kaukuz, Mahnatabat, Hajilar and Zangabat canals. All the canals of the district will need attention next February, and the Qearah Tappah, Kashkul and Zangabat will require tbe outlay of a considerable sum of money. Near Abu Zanabil a few Jubur raise water by means of tbe karad from a natural spring stream. The karad is not seen elsewhere in the district. Another method of irrigation to be seen in this district is the artifice of the kahriz or artificial underground channel. The course of a subterranean stream is followed by Avells dug at intervals of ten to twenty yards, and the channel bricked and roofed in. 3. Agriculture. —The Kifri district is famous for its winter crops, and contains the well-known Daudiyah Avheat-growing area. The winter crops are usually so profitable that cultivators do not trouble to cultivate saifi crops. The local people recognise six varieties of wheat, but it would appear that there are two main varieties, one called Kandahari, an excellent bread and biscuit wheat, the other called “ Khashn,” a much harder variety. There is only one variety of barley, the black type, and it is the unshakeable belief of the people, proved, it is stated, by experience, that whatever kind of barley is sown it will eventually all return to the Black variety The best crops are usually produced on the rain-watered lands. There are three distinct methods of cultivation :— (1) J he soundest method is ploughing the land first in winter and again in spring, and sowing in August or September on the dry ground and ploughing in the seed. Birds and mice are not so common here as in the Sulaimaniyah district. This method is called in Arabic and Turkish “ filhan,” and in Kurdish “ wushkawara,” and is called the “ sarmayah ” (capital) of the fallah. This method in moderate years gives a yield of 15 to 1, and usually more. All three methods are sown at the same rate per plough if the ground is alike. on the 2) The second method is called in Kurdish “ mevard,” and is an improvement e; first method, the land is ploughed as in the first method in the preceding wilder and spring, and after tbe first rains of tbe following autumn it is ploughed, sowed, and ploughed again. This method removes the grass and w r eeds and makes clean cultivation, but depends on very early rains for success. Given very early rains it may give a yield of 20 to 1. (3) The third method is called tarakal, and is only resorted to when there is no filhan or ward ready from the preceding spring. After the rains have fallen the land is ploughed and sown. This method depends entirely on the spring rains-425 it’ these are insufficient the crop fails. If rains are sufficient it will give a yield of 7 or 10 to 1. Cultivation on irrigated lands is called “ awaniyah 55 in Kurdish’. One azhgir of water suffices 10 faddans. The following are the rates of ploughing per plough:— Methods 1 and 2, /.&lt;?., where ploughed ground is ready— Mule plough ... . 2,200 to 2,500 kilos per faddan. Ox plough . . . _ 1^00 kilos per faddan. Method 3— Mule plough - - - . 1,000 Ox plough - . . _ 700 „ The latter is shortened not by the relative powers of the mule and oxen so much as by the time available for ploughing and sowing. Wheat and barley are cultivated in the proportion of 2 to 1 respectively. This year, owing to the ground not having been ploughed and prepared last spring, most of the crops this winter will be raised by method 3. In ‘Iraq I believe the usual arrangement is— 1 plough : two oxen : per 2 fallahs. In this district the arrangement is— 1 plough : two oxen : per single fallah. The distinction is caused by the difference in extra labour in keeping up canals. In Sanniyah lands the fallah, if advances of seed are necessary, expects to receive them on a seed for seed basis. In Tapu lands, the fallah is expected to bear all the expenses of cultivation and there are no rules as to the advance of seed by the proprietor. Kifri wheat is sought after in ‘Iraq for its pure quality—both for seed and for making bread and cakes. Summer Crops .—This year the most popular crop was millet (idhrah baidhah), but it is believed this w r as because of its patience in shortage of water and because of its great yield. In usual years only rice and simsim are growm. Maize of the ‘Iraq variety —a miserable type—is growm. Probably in future years wm shall find that rice is the most popular crop. Certainly in the valleys in the hills, where the step-method can be employed, rice is practically the only thing growm, besides vegetables, in the summer months. The type of rice grown is a kind of Naqqazah. A famous rice is growm at Zerdelikao in the Sulaimaniyah district. Vegetables. - -Mostly grown in river-beds. A small circle is cleared of pebbles and a hole dug and manure inserted, in which the seed is planted. Huge luscious water-melons and sugar-melons are produced in this way. Vegetables, especially tomatoes and brinjals, are also grown in the gardens. --Government forests exist on the banks of the Diyalah at Shaikh Baba, QaTah Shirwanah, Qarah Bulaq and between Bawa Nar and Piw r as, also at Hor al ‘Adhaim. ForestationAn ideal track for forestation, if such is needed or intended, exists in this area near Shaikh Baba on the Diyalah. Fruit Trees .—The follow ing is a list of fruit trees in this district:— Date-trees Bearing. - 1,000 Non-bearing. 1,215 Apricot - - - 9 r )0 1,802 Plums - - - - 379 246 Apples - - - 90 129 Pomegranates - - - - - 1,382 721 Pig-trees - - - (3,664 1,891 N ut-trees - - - 4 11 Vines - - - - 250 100 Sweet lime - - - 849 54 Mulberry - - - 123 137 Sour lime - - - 311 — Orange - - - 56 — Walnut - - - 10 —, Vast numbers were cut down by the Turks.426 l ) Tobacco .—Tobacco is grown at Bakr Baif, between Bawa Nur and Piwas on the Diyalah, and brought into Kifri for sale. No Turkish maps of boundaries exist, but the inhabitants as far as Piwas consider themselves as belonging to Kifri. Hence this tobacco is in the Kifri district. Agriculture under British Administration .—As stated above, we found the district inhabited by a mere fraction of its former population. Small winter crops existed, but no seed for saiti crops. Plough cattle were very scarce. In fact the district was a starving ruin. Measures were taken to resuscitate agricultural prosperity. In a completely agricultural people the only way to bring back prosperity is to provide them with the means of agriculture. The first step, therefore, was to provide seed for, and to assist cultivators to obtain seed for, saifi crops and to put canals into a state of repair. In May and June saiti seed was imported, with the assistance of Civil Officer Ba‘qubah, and the canal dams in the Diyalah built, and the Qarah Tappah, Kashkul, Baradan and Zangabat canals repaired. Cultivators were induced to return to their villages. No figures are available, but between May and September 30 villages were repaired and reinhabited. A very large saifi crop was produced, as a result of which price of wheat fell from Its. 800 to Rs. 350 a ton. On our first occupation it could not be obtained for Rs. 1,500 a ton. Merchants were persuaded to visit the Hai and these brought back, it is believed, over 300 head of cattle. Cattle are also being obtained from Revenue Board. Mules would be most useful and are considered more valuable than oxen. Money advances were sanctioned up to Rs. 50,000 for agricultural advances and were distributed whenever good security wns available. Wheat seed was brought up to Table Mountain by train. 250 tons were collected at Table Mountain, but owing to distance of Table Mountain and the shortage of local transport and the lack of assistance by military transport, the seed is not yet completely removed. The quality of the seed is favourably commented upon. 4. Municipalities. —There are three towns in the Kifri district, each constituted a'&gt; a Muncipality. For a month or two after our occupation the Municipalities were not solvent. In Turkish times the income was derived from octroi imposed on all imports, which brought in about 1,000 q.s. a month, from half slaughter-house tax 500 q.s. a month, from tax on transport animals about 250 q.s. a month, brokerage tax on sale of animals, ground tax, fines and an allotment from Tamattu income. At Tuz Khurmatu an c alwah for the sale of vegetables was instituted and the iltizam of this realised Rs. 470 for six months. The remaining taxes were collected by the Municipal staff. At Kifri Rs. 2.494 was realised in five months from the iltizam of the slaughter house, ground hawkers’ tax, transport animals’ tax, brokerage tax. For the forthcoming year the farm for these four taxes will be put up to auction in each of the three Municipalities. At Kifri a house tax was instituted, bringing in a monthly income of Rs. 500. Weighing fees were collected as a blockade measure, but it is very difficult to decide in what form they should become a Municipal tax. In Turkish times octroi was imposed on grain, but such a tax at present would discourage its import and this is the last thing we wish to do. It looks as if the backbone of Municipal revenue should be the house tax. One feels one wants to get at the tradesman more. A note on Municipalities by an experienced officer would be of great use. Perhaps the main duty of the Municipality is town conservancy, including both (1) town repairs and improvement and (2) sanitation. In most Municipalities there are to be found men who of themselves will turn their energies to the former, but there are few who will do aught but completely disregard the latter—at any rate’ as far as our methods of tins and incinerators are concerned. Khans .—There are 10 khans in Kifri, 3 in Qarah Tappah, 2 in Tuz Khurmatu.Shops. The following list shows number of shops in the three Municipalities: — Wholesale Traders Kifri. Tuz Khurmatu.

Medical and Sanitation : Medical .—So long as the troops were inoccupation of Kifri a civil dispensary—capable of being extended, should need arise, into a civil hospital—was run with the assistance of a visiting M.O. and a whole-time British staff from the local detachment of 39ih F.A. This arrangement proved of inestimable value when an epidemic of cholera overtook the town in August and September, and the inhabitants were grateful for its existence. The inhabitants were even persuaded by the gravity of the epidemic to allow their water to be chlorinated, but regretted their rashness when an epidemic of influenza followed, which all, without exception, put down to the chlorination of the water. A fitful spurt of sanitary zeal prevailed amongst the people while the cholera raged, but died off when the cholera disappeared. When the last of the troops left Kifri the M.O. and staff of the civil hospital also departed and the civil hospital has since been closed. Sanitation .—Kifri was almost completely a military town during the hot weather and town conservancy was completely military. During the stay of the troops, 11 latrines and 8 incinerators were built. The latrines were of the tin system. Very few people used them. A twelfth latrine was instituted, consisting of a large yard with no particular receptacle for the excreta, but from which the excreta were removed daily. This latrine was universally popular. The incinerators are kept busily burning, but do not make any impression on the vast piles of rubbish by their side. I am not sure that it would not be cheaper and safer to bury it and oil the surface. Remarks .—The military methods of sanitation cannot be applied to Arab or Kurd villages unless there exists a large staff of British overseers and Indian sweepers, When the British overseers and Indian sweepers are removed the sanitation fails. Tin latrines are worse than useless. Frequently cleaned pit latrines would probably be safer. 6. Education. —In Turkish times there was a primary school at Tuz Khurmatu. This was reopened in June and now contains between 40 and 50 pupils. The teachers are apparently favourably regarded by the inhabitants. In Kifri in Turkish times there were two schools, a primary (ibtidaiyah) and a secondary (rashdiyab) school. The secondary school before the war had four teachers and from 50 to 00 pupils. The primary school had 40 to 5C pupils and two teachers. The municipality and the Turkish Government had collected funds for the building of a fine municipal school building. The building was not completed and what part had been built was ruined by rain. The four teachers of the rashdiyah school were sent to Baghdad for a course in May and on their return in September the Kifri school was reopened. There are at present only 30 odd pupils, the small number being due, it is said, to the unattract iveness of the teachers. There is a great desire amongst the people for their children to learn English.428 7. Judicial. —Under the Turkish Government the Civil and Canonical Law' Courts were separate, hut the Qadhi presided over each. Otherwise there was a separate establishment for each. When we occupied Kifri, the Qadhi had fled with other departing officials, hut the Mufti remained. Muhd. Sa‘id Effendi. Muhd. Sa‘id Effendi was appointed Qadhi of the Shar‘ah Court. P. O. Kirkuk had appointed Ahmad Effendi, Peace Court Judge at Kirkuk, and this official returned with the troops to Kifri at the evacuation of Kirkuk. He was then appointed Peace Court Judge at Kifri, and heard cases up to Rs. 500. When Kirkuk was re-occupied he returned to his original appointment at Kirkuk, and I appointed Muhd. Sa‘id Effendi Rais of the Peace Court in addition to his duties of Sha‘rah Court. His establishment is small, consisting of a clerk, bailiff, doorkeeper, and peon. But occasionally, in commercial suits, local merchants are invited to sit as members of the court. Muhammed Sa‘id Effendi is possessed of considerable judicial and religious learning, but, unfortunately, has not the power of eloquent and conciliatory speech. 8. Police and Crime. —There has been little crime. Two murders were settled by A. P. O. Tuz by tribal fasl, and one by the exaction of the death sentence upon the murderer. Two murders only occurred in the nahiyahs of Kifri and Qarah Tappah, one of which w r as settled by tribal fasl and in the case of the other, the murderer was known, hut ran away and cannot he apprehended. About a dozen cases of burglary occurred, which required police action, and the offenders sentenced, except in one case at Qarah Tappah, in which the keepers of the canteen amongst the troops there alleged that they had been burgled of Rs. 12,000. No clue at all was found, and I have considerable doubts as to the genuineness of the claim. The lack of an honest yet capable police inspector is severely felt. In most cases of theft good detective work was done by Mukhtars and inhabitants of villages. There were not more than three cases of highway robbery within the district, though several Kifri caravans were robbed in the Dali ‘Abbas area by the ‘Azzah tribe. The people have a habit of losing donkeys at night, and petitioning that they were robbed of them. The donkey-loser is the most familiar petitioner. One case of extortion was tried and sentenced. The blockade was accompanied by several trials for bribery and abuse of passes. No police constables or detectives are really necessary in this district. It is better that the villagers should continue their detective energies, hut what is much needed is an honest and capable man who can he sent out to investigate cases, and who will put up cases in such a way that they may he immediately proceeded with. The combination of honesty and ability is difficult to find. 9. Shabanah. —No Shabanah force has been raised in this district. Sanction was obtained to arm 195 Political and Blockade sowars and footmen. I have yet no need of Shahanah in this district, and it would be difficult to raise a force of horsemen willing to accept military training. All posts, when necessary, are maintained by the tribal chiefs, and are more satisfactory in a tribal area. What is necessary is a number, and no very large number, of essentially “ odd job ” men. They carry mails, take messages, make arrests, escort convoys and Government officials, turn out and direct labour on canals and roads, guard Government offices and dumps. A number of trained foot police would be of use in the guards for the Political Office, hut the difficulty has been to find anyone to train them. Corp. Wooley was attached to this office as blockade policeman up to mid-November, when lie was transferred to duties of supervision of political sowars and foot. During the hot weather the greater part of the sowars were Kirkuk gendarmerie who came from Kirkuk with the evacuating troops. These made up for their extreme dishonesty by a comparative knowledge of discipline and care of horses. At the reoccupation of Kirkuk these, with a few exceptions, returned to Kirkuk. The sowars who remain are tribal, enlisted under security from their chiefs. These men require careful handling and cannot at once be forced to drill. On the other hand, a good uniform is necessary for purposes of attracting recruits.10, Labour. Military labour was almost completely recruited from immigrants; thus labour in this district has not caused any complaints. In the event of a railway being built through the district it would probably be difficult to obtain sufficient labour. All peasants are employed on their crops. All unemployed find employment on the Khanaqin road. 11. Miscellaneous : Sequestrated Estates .—A small house and garden exists at Qarah Tappah, the property of a Turkish officer who lias not yet returned. This has been administered in the usual way. 12. Blockade.^ —A stiff blockade was maintained up to its abolition. The blocKade was particularly annoying to tribal chiefs, whom no limit of sugar would satisfy. 13. Establishment and Personnel. —This office has been fortunate that its head clerk and record clerk has withstood the rigors of the Kifri climate. In the post of accountant the Office has not been so lucky and very many changes have been caused by sickness. The connection between the Accounts Office and the Headquarters Revenue Office is not so close as one Would like it to be. It seems to be almost invariably necessary for the A. P. O. himself to make out the statistics and returns prepared from the English cash accounts and the vernacular demand and receipt statements. The language barrier prevents the accountant from being able to thoroughly scrutinise the revenue demand and receipt statistics in vernacular and compare them with the actual cash receipts shown by the cashier or those in kind shown by Mamur ‘Anbar. The Mai Mudir of the qadha is ‘Uthman Effendi. I am bound to express my appreciation of this man’s energy and ability. He had an unblemished reputation for honesty in the time of the Turks and is extremely popular amongst the tribesmen and all inhabitants outside Kifri. In Kifri itself his bribe-proof nature puts him apparently outside the pale of Kifri society. The post of Mamur Shu hah, Kifri, is vacant at present, the late Mamur having been moved out to take charge of Qarah Tappah. The Mamur Shu‘bah, Tuz Khurmatu, has already twice earned official praise for his unremitting energy. R. S. Jardine, Captain, Asst. Political Officer, Kifri. 10th January 1919.Administrative Report, Kirkuk District, period October 26th— December 31st, 1918. 1. Political and Tribal: {a) Military .—During May P)18 British forces entered Kirkuk and remained in possession for 18 days, before withdrawing to Suz Khormatu. Capt. R. W. Bullard, C J.E., Political Officer, Kirkuk, during this period established touch with some tribal leaders, secured order in the town, distributed food, and was building up a staff and an administration when the work was broken off by the retirement. Jewish and Christian refugees were evacuated to the occupied territories. Upon our withdrawal, Turkish forces immediately reoccupied the town and the district as far south as the Tauq Chai. British forces again occupied the town on October 26th, and passed immediately through it, leaving a single company as garrison. An Assistant Political Officer, Capt. S. H. Longrigg, had accompanied the column, and assumed his duties immediately. (6) -Kirkuk was, under the Turks, the headquarters of a mutasarriflik, including the qadhas of Rowanduz, Rania, Arbil, Qoi Sanjaq, and Kifri. Under the British distribution it became the headquarters of a division, with A.P.O.s at Kirkuk, Altun Keupri, and Kifri. The officer, however, appointed as political officer, Kirkuk Division, did not assume charge of the area except in direction of the broadest policy, and in administrative matters A.P.O.s were under the direction of the Civil Commissioner direct. Capt. Hay, A.P.O., Altun Keupri, reached his headquarters town on November 2nd. Under this arrangement A.P.O., Kirkuk, administered the three Turkish nahiyahs of Kirkuk (strictly speaking, a “liwa”), Tauq, and Gil; and A.P.O., Altun Keupri, the nahiyahs of Altun Keupri, Malhah, and Shuan. Subsequently, A.P.O., Altun Keupri, removed to Qoi Sanjaq (December 15th). leaving the six nahiyahs to A.P.O., Kirkuk. These constitute the present Kirkuk district. (2) Its boundaries are: on the north the lesser Zab, with the villages of the Luk tribe beyond it; east, a line from Tak-tak on the Zab to Ibrahim Khanji westward to strike the Jabal Hamrin; and west, a shadowy line needless to delimitate, running up the Huwaijah to touch the Zab at Tall ‘Ali It embraces thus five to six thousand square miles of land, all cultivable, and none wholly unpopulated. There are hills west and south-west of Altun Keupri, and the flatness of the Huwaijah is broken by the Jabal Hamrin; otherwise, the main Kifri-Irbil road is the boundary of hill and plain, as well as of Kurd and Arab. (c) Communications. These are the main Baghdad-Mosul road running up the middle ; the Kirkuk-Sulaimaniyah road, barely passable for wheels; desert tracks to Tikrit and t athah, a road following the Zab from Altun Keupri to the Tigris ; mule- paths from Tauq to Chamchamal, and from Kirkuk to Qoi Sanjaq. The lesser Zab, bridged at Altun Keupri, is a formidable barrier, deep and rapid, and quickly responsive to floods. Its commercial use is as the route of laden kelleks to Baghdad. The “ Golden bridge ” was broken by the retiring Turks the day before the Armistice, leaving a span of 60 feet missing and still unrepaired. Generally speaking, com munications are made difficult in winter by the easy flooding of the numerous streams which run westward from the fringe of the Kurdish hills; by the softness of the ground which a sprinkling of rain turns to soft mud; by abrupt and irregular hills of steep giadients and destructive torrents. Nowhere, however, is the country impassable for pack animals. (2) lelegiaph lines followed the Kifri-Irbil and the Kirkuk-Sulaimaniyah roads, with offices at Tauq, Kirkuk and Altun Keupri. W Population.—'Vhfi Western flank of the district is populated by Arabs only, nomadic vithin limits, ihe pre\ailing tribe, the c Ubaid, are not cultivators, but breeders of flocks and camels; a small minority live in houses; the bulk in tents, wandeiing in quest of the best grass and water over all the country between the Zab Tigris, and ‘Adhaim. Only along the Zab, where excellent flat lands are watered by charaids, and on the western outskirts of Kirkuk and the Malhah nahiyah, is cultiva tion largely practised. In these areas the land is owned mainly by Kirkuklis, whose431 ploughs and sheep are tended by Arabs whom the example of the townsmen—and at times of imported Kurds and Turks—has taught a settled life. (2) Nominally and originally a single tribe, all the dwellers in the Huwaiiah owe a shadowy allegiance to Shaikh Husain al ‘Ali; but they are now split into 8 or 10 sections, each the followers of a Shaikh who is, in few cases, obedient to Shaikh Husain, and commonly denies being ‘Ubaid at all. Such are the Albu Kais, Albu Mufarraj, Albu Ali, Albu Hamdan, and several more. From the administrative point of view the tribe is intangible, and responsibility for the frequent robberies is difficult to fix. The Turk left the‘Ubaid almost entirely to its own resources and aquiesced in the levying of “ mudharrih ” and “fuqaq.” We, with the line of communications being more and more plainly indicated across the Huwaijah from Kirkuk to the Tigris, must ensure security for caravans. (3) Along the main Baghdad-Mosul road the villages are settled, but racially mixed. Tauq, Tazah Khurmatu, Kirkuk, Altun Keupri and most of the villages intermediate contain perhaps 25 per cent. Arabs, 35 per cent. Kurds, 40 per cent. Turcomans, fragments of Turkish stock left here at an early date, and still speaking Turkish. This language prevails in the villages along the stage-road and in Kirkuk itself. This strip is non-tribal therefore, and not purely Kurdish, except just around Tauq. Consequently, no attempt has been made to adopt such tribal scheme of government as has been very acceptable in other places. A couple of large non-tribal villages —Tazah Khurmatu and Bashir—are included in the beat of one set of tribal police, with satisfactory results ; but the feeling of these mongrel villages is all against apeing the tribe, and they state a decided preference for an ordinary mudir over an artificial shaikh. Included in this category are the Bibani just above Kirkuk, an authentic Kurdish tribe historically, but now shrunk to a few houses mixed with Turcoman cultivators and without ambition to see the tribe unified and restored. The pleasant hilly area of the Qarah Hasan, between Kirkuk and Chamchamal, is non-tribal also, but purely Kurdish. The leading families are mainly of Saiyid stock. Attempts were made here to induce some natural groups to form themselves, to be the units of government under heads generally acclaimed. But too many heads and too little acclamation prevented this ; and the present method of dealing with this area remains a compromise between the tribal and the official line. The invocation by 20 of these villages of a shaikh from without—Muhammad Habib of the Talabani—is perhaps a helpful indication of a method useful elsewhere. The leaders of the Qarah Hasan society are dark, wealthy, illiterate Kurds, highly intelligent. (4) The remainder of the area is that of Kurdish tribes. Across the Zab, the seven tillages of the Luk owe allegiance to a weak and unpromising chief, Kokha Nadir. These are sedentary, and unprogressive. South-west of Altun Keupri, the Salihi, under Shaikh Najm-ad-Din, own 10 or 12 villages and mix with the fringes of the Arabs of Barwar Dagh and the Huwaijah. There is a respectable tribe, mostly speaking Arabic as well as Kurdish. In each of these two tribes the paramount Shaikh has been made Mudir. East of the Kirkuk-Altun Keupri road, pressed between the Chamchamal road and the Shaikh Bazaini villages whch line the Zab, are the Shuan. Their two sections, Sarkasa and Kashik, are subdivided each into two or three groups. The Shuan air is thick with feuds and controversies, but the tribe as a whole—if it could let itself be such —is a strong and wealthy one, sedentary and cultivating on excellently watered hills. Politically, their position is still to be determined. Above them the Shaikh Bazaini are astride the Zab, only one section, on the left bank, being in the Shuan nahiyah. Here, too, no settled state of things has been reached and no aspirant for recognition has a satisfactory record. Possibly it may be found well to give this tribe complete to Qoi Sanjaq. The most important tribe of the district is the Talabani: Kurdish, sedentary, cultivating, and at present peaceful and particularly warm in their welcome to the British Government. The tribe falls into three divisions, which have all been recog nised and preserved : one at Tauq; one between Kirkuk and the Jabbari country; one at Gil. The second-named has now the Qarah Hasan villages merged with it, all under Shaikh Habib; the third is that of Shaikh Hamid, one of the best known men of southern Kurdistan, a warm friend of our Government from the earliest days of contact, and now (after a long lifetime of violence) a just and peaceful old man. Near Tauq are half-a-dozen villages of the Kakai, mixed Kurds under a family of Barzanji landowners, cultivating and peaceful; and a corner of the Daudi, across the Tauq Chai, five wealthy villages acquiescent in the mudirate of Dara Beg, whose elder brother was paramount Shaikh of the whole tribe. In the hills, between the Tauq Chai and the Hamawand country, are the Jabbari Saiyids, strongly tinged withreligion, quarrelsome rather than Avarlike, and on had terms with their Talabani neighbours. Here Shaikh Saiyid Muhammad has been given his group 25 Aullages to keep in order. All the tribes detailed above have been handed to their paramount shaiks, who have signed documents accepting responsibility for roads, telegraphs, security and revenue of their areas. This state of things—admittedly an experiment and one that asks^ ideal conditions—has been welcomed by the selected Shaikhs and has worked well in the brief period under report. The dangers of such a system are apparent; its advantages, that it fosters a national feeling in the Kurd which may have asset later on ; that it removes him from the offensive and corrupt ways of the professional Effendi, and reduces to one the possible offenders against justice and liberty. In the remainder of the district, the former machinery, modified, is working. The Tauq district being all tribal, no political or revenue staff is stationed there, except for a granary and a post of so Avars. Malhah has a revenue mamur, a granary and a police post; Altun Keupri a mudir, responsible for the law and order of the two nahiyahs, a revenue and customs staff, a granary and police-post. It is likely that the Shuan nahiyah will be similarly provided shortly. 2. Revenue : (a) Land Revenue. —The British occupation of the area was in time to collect the saifi revenues. The garden and vegetable dues Avere remitted; the remainder collected all in cash, except for maize, millet, and rice. Estimate was done partly by Revenue officials, partly by the tribal authorities for their own areas, and in places the Turkish estimation adopted. No trouble and feAV complaints have been brought to notice. The crops are in quantity probably not 25 per cent, of the average ante-bellum year ; in quality, uniformly good. (b) Tapn. —Nearly all the land in the Kirkuk neighbourhood is tapu; and Kirkuk landowners own estates in Malhah and elsewhere. The purchase of tapu has in some cases lead to the “ foundation ” of a tribe : a purchaser of estates settles on his land, attracts fallahs, multiplies villages, and is hailed as Shaikh. Conversely, it happens that the local shaikh, as in the Qarah Hasan hills, does not own the rights of the village, but is deputy for an absentee owner. In the tribes there is much land classed as tapu which has never passed through the register, but has fulfilled the conditions by length of occupancy; and some more whose ownership is too closely tied up Avith political rights to have undergone close, and possibly unpleasant, scrutiny as yet. There is no uniformity about the collecting rates, the shares consequent upon oAvnership of the Avater, the fallahs’ share, or anything else. All requires full and careful sifting, and probably will provide work for a special land record office for some months. Individual disputed cases—unfortunately often between claimants from differing tribes—have been settled, and others are warned to come up for judgment shortly. Boundary and ownership questions in this district have caused much blood to flow and a really effective settlement is a necessity. Past conditions have never allowed of this—as, for example, when the Hamawand, suspecting a man of owning title deeds, burnt doAvn the village to destroy them. There is one small patch of Sunniyah land—and, in the Arab part of this district, all is miri. (c) Waqf. —Kirkuk is a hotbed of Sunni waqf. The papers recovered from the Turkish Auqaf Mamur are not in good order, and the question of the cash deposited Avith him is still under inquiry. The monthly pay bill for mosque staff—now more or less in final shape—is about Bs. 800 monthly. Above this there are subsistence grants to the postnachins of takias, payable in kind or cash; there are honorary grants to ulama and professors ; there is a monthly grant of Rs. 1,010 to the Kirkuk Madrasah Ilmiyah. A very large number of waqfs are owned by mutawallis. The “ madhbat ” revenues—not yet completely ascertained—are certainly very rich, and it is said that in past years a considerable yearly balance was sent to Stambul. The lands of the Jahbari tribe are all mauquf to the family, but collection and payment is made by the Auqaf Department, the collection being let on iltizam. Up to the time of writing all the time of the Auqaf staff has been taken in trying to get some records together and verifying, from tattered firmans, the ravenous applications for salaries. Waqf properties—mosques, takias, &amp;c.—are mostly in battered condition. (d) Public Debt. —A staff of a mudir and several clerks was transacting the business of the Public Debt here up to the time of our arrival. Their revenues werefrom fences for seUing tumbak,” from fishing licences, from‘araq, stamps, and T a ^’ mu S * } im ^ e ^ ls ^ s m the Zab. Araq is brewed considerably among the Kirkuk Jews, ibe stamps tax is not now being levied. The salt mines worked from Kirkuk were three—that of iuz Khormatu, of Kom, and of the Jabal Hamrin. Prom now onwards only the last named is likely to be run from Kirkuk, and that is too far 0 , ™ a he any system but an iltizam desirable. The Tuz pans are run from Kifri, a, ad that ot Kom by Sulaimaniyah. In the Kirkuk office a portion of the Public Debt stall is now working as Miscellaneous Revenues Department. The Accounts can at any moment be detached from General Kevenues in favour of any adiustment that may be made. (e) Customs: (1) Regie. The Regie staff and their activities have been kept on here, the latter modified as the tobacco-growing areas have passed into the occupied territory. Generally speaking, the Regie pass, indicating that tobacco has been through the warehouse and has paid or undertakes to pay its dues, is honoured, and absolves from all further demands. With no pass, a consignment of tobacco is considered as smuggled. It has not been thought well to retain preventive service, therefore importation must he by specified routes and by day, or otherwise an intention to smuggle is assumed. Convoys caught entering the customs’ line—which is that of Kifri, Kirkuk, Altun Keupri—with a Regie pass, but at illegal times and places, are punished by double collection of duty; while if they are so caught without a pass confiscation follows. The duties of Regie officials at Kirkuk were to prevent smuggling and to issue licences. They are now expanded to include the registration of merchandise passing outside the customs line (whether dutiable articles or not), the keeping of trade records—somewhat inexact—of incoming convoys from Baghdad, &amp;c., and the control of customs. (b) Customs is leviable on articles from or proceeding to Persia or other foreign countries. The arrangements are doubtless being fully reported on by the department concerned. Here the trade with Persia is completely dormant—owing to the season, the scarceness of transport, and the brisk trade available nearer home. 3. Irrigation. This subject has not arisen in the two months of our occupation of Kirkuk, and will probably never do so on an important scale. The bulk of the winter grains, famed for their excellence, do with the rain alone, and the summer channelling of the water is, though thorough and ingenious, on a small scale. The nahiyah of Malhah, where the flat and level banks of the Lesser Zab allow for upwards of 200 Avaterlifts. is the most promising field for a scheme of canals. Traces are visible of at least three former canals running out of the Zab into the Huwaijah, and the area capable of being watered directly from such canals is at least 300 square miles. But in the present absence of cultivators, machines, and labour, tnis work is not immediately feasible, and its place is likely to be taken by pumping engines, which landowners of this area are eagerly demanding. 4. Agricultural. —The whole district, except the west flank of unsettled Arabs, is agricultural. War conditions, however, and very genuine oppression from the Turkish powers, have sadly reduced the vitality of a famous producing area. The grain of Shuan and Malhah is only less copious than that of the Dizai. To treat leniently the small summer crops, and do all possible to augment winter sowings, has been the policy clearly indicated here. At the outset it was decided, after consulting notables and landowners, that the issue of agricultural loans on a generous scale would be well repaid. Accordingly, Rs. 160,000 have been distributed in this district, without conditions, except that a specified number of ploughs (one to every Rs. 170 of the loan) must he sown. Bailing compliance with this, or failing repayment by- August 31st 1920, interest will be charged; otherwise none. To issue seed on loan has not been possible ,• it is available, excellent and fairly cheap for all who care to fetch it from the Dizai. Plough animals are scarce, and efforts to find a good source of supply have failed ; 600 Indian bulls are on order. The weather hitherto has been extraordinarily favourable, a blend of sun and rain having brought on all things sown abnormally early. Enthusiasts for the new Government deny that this is accidental. Sowings up to date—and they are practically complete—show a preponderance of barley over wheat as 4 to 1. The gross yield in both together in the harvest of 1919 will perhaps lie between 8 and 15 thousand tons. 5. Municipalities.— (a) Kirkuk .—The town of Kirkuk consists of some 5,000 houses, of which 3,200 are now occupied. The population at our occupation was434 14,500 souls ; it has now probably increased to 16,000, with a further floating popu lation of perhaps 1,500. As the head of a sanjaq and meeting place of Mosul, Baghdad, and Persian currents of trade, the town was a busy and wealthy one ; but the stress of war, and, in particular the blockade enforced in the occupied territories, had reduced the city at the time of our arrival to great poverty. TAe entered to find the town dirty and in ill-repair, wasted with fever and poverty, and in trade and produce paralysed. A large section of the officials (a most important stratum here) fled with the withdrawing government to Irbil, hundreds of Christians and Jews were absent as refugees in Baghdad, some of the most influential Muslims had withdrawn to remote estates in the district. The Baladiyah staff was found intact, except for the President, who shortly returned from Irbil. During the short period under report, their labours, combined with the sudden removal of war conditions and restrictions, have wrought a most gratifying change in the state of the town. Pood prices have dropped 300 per cent., partly owing to large imports from beyond the Zab, partly to free importation from ‘Iraq. The public health, owing to a prevailing malaria, remains indifferent. Every day brings refugees and emigrants back to their homes, while the bazaar, which 10 weeks ago blended the features of a seAver and a wilderness, is now the scene of much trade and bustle. The corps of sweepers employed by the municipality and controlled by a native sanitary officer has made some difference to the cleanliness of the streets, but the frequence of ruined buildings, and the too natural habits of the Kirkuklis, prevent a high standard in this direction. The municipal income, mostly let out on farm, is approximately Us. 7,000 a month—ample to support an adequate staff and do good work in cleaning, repairing, and improving the town and relieving poverty. In the earliest days of our occupation the remarkable number of destitute children called for an orphanage, which was at once started and holds 50 children. This has been paid for by General Besources. The improvement in the condition of the inmates has thoroughly justified it. (b) Altun Keupri.—AYAs Baladiyah is supported almost entirely by the fees from crossing the Zab. The breaking of the bridge has necessitated the use of the ferry under municipal arrangements. The town, shrunk to less than 2,000 souls, is any thing but prosperous, and was particularly dirty. The agricultural loans, the provision of skins for kelleks, and the prospect of the bridge being rebuilt, have done something to revive the inhabitants from a very noticeable apathy and dullness. In former times the revenues from the bridge tolls so far exceeded the needs of the place that large sums were remitted to public objects (such as the School of Arts and Crafts) in Kirkuk. (c) Tauq .—As the headquarters of a mudirate this has long been a baladiyah— but no municipal activities of any sort are discernable and cannot well be expected in view of the minute revenues. Just enough money can be scraped together to pay small wages to a clerk and a chaush, and occasionally sweep a road. Tauq, indeed, is a mere village and not the largest in the district. 6. Judicial. —Immediately upon the British occupation of Kirkuk the need for courts became apparent. The months of officialised pillage and the numerous civil cases arising from a period of instability and disrespect of rights, far exceeded the powers of a single officer to settle. A peace court, placed under Ahmad Hamdi Effendi, who was appointed Qadhi by Captain Bullard, was opened, with power to decide civil cases not affecting real property up to a value of Its. 500. He has proved an extremely energetic and efficient president. The court has averaged live or six cases a day and court fees have reached Its. 1,800 a month. * Petty criminal cases were left for a time in the hands of a police Mudir, since promoted to other work. They and others arising in Kirkuk town are now dealt with by the Assistant to A.P.O. A shaEah court will probably be opened shortly, as the need of it is becoming increasingly apparent. Some cases of land rights have been submitted for investigation to a special standing committee of three select notables, who have collected and sifted evidence to enable A.P.O. to give a ruling. It is realised that, pending a general settlement of the country by a specially qualified officer or committee, such a ruling can be little more than a personal opinion and does not confer a final and perfect right. 7 7. Education. —Judged by the number of schools and professors, Kirkuk, under the Turks, was very well supplied with educational facilities. There were seven schools supported hy Government; a large Madrasah Ilmiyah, paid for half by435 Zz'y Government and halt by Waqf; many small mosque schools and many “ mudarrisin ” piepaiec to consider pupils; also a well-equipped school of arts and crafts. The Jews and Christians each had schools. The Madrasah Ilmiyah has now reopened somewhat chastened by the withdrawal of the Government grant, which was formerly spent entirely on pay for an enormous number of unqualified teachers. The budget or the Madrasah showed that each pupil cost Us. 70 a month, and the education was a \ei 3 sketchy and backward type. The numbers of teachers has uoav been greatly reduced, and a stipulation made that none are appointed except by the majlis auqat. Lo this A.P.O. was careful to appoint men of modern ideas and independent incomes. the School of Arts and Crafts was completely stripped by the retreating Turks, and is now the civil hospital. Some of the equipment is being recovered from Irbil. As to the mosque schools and professors, some are now in receipt of pensions from auqaf and general revenues, and their pretensions to be school proprietors will be scrutinised. A Government school has been opened, with four masters and 90 boys. The boys should increase in a few weeks to at least 200. A most excellent building served the same purpose formerly, the best school building, probably, in Iraq. The headmaster, trained by the Department, brought with him from Baghdad an adequate supply of books and maps. He should fill the post well; the three assistant masters are not brilliant, but the best available and carefully chosen. The demand for English is very eager, but no teacher is available. It would probably double the attendance in a few days. Many of the leading Kirkuklis are nightly studying English. The language of instruction is Turkish ; Arabic is taught. 8. Medical and Sanitation. —A municipal doctor was among the refugees who left their houses in May and fled to Baghdad. A successor to him—also a Chaldean Christian and similarly trained at the French college at Beirut—was appointed by the Turkish Government and was working at the time of the British occupation. His instruments had largely been commandeered by the Turks, dressings and medicines he had none, and his pay had never been paid. 10(E. sent by him to Mosul to buy drugs has not reappeared. He was at once engaged as civil doctor for the town, and an assistant and 40 sweepers, with donkeys, taken on as permanent employees of the municipality. Work on cleaning has proceeded regularly since. A month later the original municipal doctor reappeared, and was shortly engaged as sanitary officer, while medical work was left in the hands of the other. During December the arrangements for a civil dispensary and hospital were made, a small store of drugs arrived, and supplies should in future do so at regular intervals; a trained dispenser and vaccinator were brought, with vaccinating material, from Baghdad. The Civil Hospital was opened to patients at the end of December and is now working smoothly. Equipment for 30 beds is actually in hand, and expansion to any extent is possible. An out-patient comes twice daily for treatment and medicines, and the number availing themselves of this is likely to be considerable. Those able to do so will pay for their drugs. The sanitary staff, except for the doctor in charge of it, is paid from the muni cipality, but is under his orders. He is responsible for the register of births, deaths, and infectious diseases ; for the enforcing of the rules already issued; for the proper regulation of shops, slaughter-houses, baths, coffee-houses, &amp;c.; for sanitary state of streets, public places, and canals, and for the public latrines, of which 40 have been erected or adapted. 9. Police. — Many of the regular Kirkuk police were enrolled as such by Capt. Bullard in May, and, on the British withdrawal ^accompanied him. They did duty in Kifri during the summer. Meanwhile their places in the Kirkuk police were in most cases not filled. On our re-occupation a proper town police force was an immediate necessity. The A.P.O. therefore brought up from Tuz with him some 30 police, and raised more in Kirkuk. Thirty of the Kirkuklis then at Kifri were returned. Unfortunately the Kirkuk police of Turkish times bear a uniformly bad name ; the best Kirkuklis have urged that none of these should be re-enrolled. This has, therefore, been largely avoided. The police in the district are now as follows:— At Kirkuk At Tauq At Altun Keupri At Malhah 29 horse; 59 foot. 14 „ 12 foot. 12 „ — Gg 2All the above, except the Kirkuk town police, are used principally as messengers, escorts, and postmen. Owing to their constant absence from their headquarters on duty, no training is practicable; and in no post, except Kirkuk, is there anybody capable of conducting it. It is, however, hoped shortly to tram at Kirkuk some N.C.O.’s and selected men in mounted work, and return them to tram ttie rest at their respective posts. Distances between posts are in every case a tuii day s journey. The Altun Keupri and Malhah posts were raised in those places, and lack uniforms All have rifles, some provided by the Government, some by themselves. The Kirkuk and Tauq sowars have a skeleton uniform of Kurdish pattern which will be used for all the sowars of the district, A sowar throughout the district receives Rs. 50 a month, with free fodder. . , , The Kirkuk town police are distributed at headquarters and m tour brancn police posts in the town. Night street patrols form their chief duty. Two hours a day (and one extra for N.C.O.s); they are drilled at headquarters by British N.C.O.s specially retained for this work, and have made remarkably good progress. They are enlisted for one year, at Its. 40 per month. All have rides, and khaki uniforms are on the way. # , t , p • The type of Kurd or Turkoman in this district willing to enlist for a year m tne police is not a high one. There are trustworthy men, but the majority are otherwise; and opportunities for misconduct are many. The cure for that lies in heightened discipline, in the self-respect which drill and uniform will help to produce, and in the severe and public punishment of detected crimes. 10. Shabanahs. —It has been proposed to form a Shabanah force for the Kirkuk-Kifri area, with headquarters at Kirkuk. This, however, belongs to a further report. 11. Labour. -Labour and engineer officers have from time to time raised labour for military objects. Early in our occupation a branch of the 48th Kurdish Labour Corps was enrolled in Kirkuk and worked, about 60 strong, for some weeks. At present practically no native labour is used in Kirkuk, though it is believed that some will shortly he raised for road work. Elsewhere, work on roads has been done by labour raised casually in the villages near the work. There exists in the district a surplus of men who this year have not necessary substance to cultivate, and are available for casual employment. This fact is responsible for much of the crime. But the population of the district generally is thin (about 14 to the square mile); and the labour possibly raisable would not exceed 1,000 men. 12. Miscellaneous : Newspapers.-- The presence of a small but complete press in Kirkuk lead to the inception of a small daily paper, the “ Kirkuk Star.” The printer was previously the propagandist agent of the \oung Turks. The paper, which includes Reuter’s summaries, official announcements, local and Baghdad news and prices, and contributions by “ Ashraf,” sells fairly well and has a wide area to monopolise. The circulation should reach four or five hundred. It started in Arabic, but was changed to the prevailing language, Turkish, at the general wish. S. H. Longrigg, Capt., Assistant Political Officer, 9.1.19. Kirkuk.437 KUWAIT AGENCY. Administration Report of the Kuwait Political Agency for the year 1918. 1. Political and Tribal: Introduction .—Thy irime Kuwait is the diminutive of Kut and means a small fort: it sufficiently indicates the insignificant origin of the thriving town of Kuwait, the capital of the principality which now shares its name. In old English records and books Kuwait is generally called “ Graine ” or “ Grane,” doubtless from the Island of Qurain, a short distance to the west of it. Boundaries .—The boundaries of Kuwait as defined in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 are as follows :— The line of demarkation starts from the side of the mouth of the Khor Zubair towards the north-west and passes immediately to the south of Umm Qasr, Safwan and Jabal Sanam in such a manner as to leave the wells of these places in the wilayat of Basrah; arrived at the Batin it follows it towards the south-west to Hafar al Batin, which it leaves on the side of Kuwait; from this point the said line goes to the south-east, leaving to Kuwait the wells of Al Safhah, A1 Qarah, Al Habah, Wabrah, and Anta‘, and joins the sea near Jabal Manifah. The islands of War bah, Bubiyan, Mashjan, Eailakah, ‘Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru, Maqta 4 , and Umm al Maradim, with their islands and adjacent waters, are comprised in Kuwait territory. Growth .—As more than a petty town shaikhdom, the Sultanate of Kuwait is quite modern. The actual ruler, indeed, is only the third either to be generally styled Sultan or to claim a wider area of jurisdiction than the immediate neighbour hood of the fort and townlet which an ancestor, driveu by the Turks out of his small holding at Umm Qasr on the Khor ‘Abdullah, built on the south side of the Grane inlet early in the eighteenth century. Growth has been fostered by the increased trade of the Gulf since piracy was suppressed and the pearl-fishing industry encouraged, and by the interest taken in the place by all concerned in the question of the Baghdad Bail way’s outlet on the sea. Political .—Nominally Kuwait w r as, until about twenty years ago, included, in the Ottoman province of Basrah, the shaikh, as de facto ruler, being accepted by the Porte as governor de jure, and in 1871, when Midhat Pasha occupied Hasa, the then .shaikh subscribed to this interpretation of his status. But the British Government of India, which bad never accepted it, insisted on dealing with him directly when the Baghdad Railway question began to loom on the horizon, and has since supported his house against the Turks, with whom the late Sultan, Shaikh Sir Mubarak al Sabbah, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., repudiated all relations on the outbreak of war in 1914. In 1899 the latter entered into an agreement with us and, four years later, he accepted a British political agent at his court. He subsequently regarded himself as under British protection, and made important exclusive concessions to us. Ruler .—In November 1915 Mubarak died and was succeeded by his eldest son Jabir, who died in Eebruary 1917, and was in turn succeeded by his brother Salim, the present ruler. Population .—The settled population of the Sultanate is estimated at about 65,000, of whom about 50,000 are resident in Kuwait town. Of the latter, about 25,000 are Kuwaitis, 15,000 Persians and Bahrainis and 10,000 Najdis, Beduins and natives of ‘Iraq. Tribes.— tribes, the ‘Awazim and the Rashaidah, together with a portion of the Mutair, form the bulk of the population outside that of Kuwait town. Small bands of other tribes, such as Dhafir, Bani Khalid, &amp;c. (who are merely visitors) enter Kuwait territory at certain seasons. Villages .—The principal villages in the district with their approximate populations are:—Jaharah, 500; Eantas, 400; Abu Hulaifah, 200; Euhaihil, 200; Shu‘aibah, 60. Blockade .—Eor a considerable time evidence had been accumulating which showed that Kuwait was being used as a base for supplying goods to the Turks and Gg 3to the tribes ranged on the Turkish side, and at the end of 1917 it was decided that the establishment of a blockade at Kuwait was essential. On January 4th, 1918, Shaikh Salim, the Kuler of Kuwait, agreed to our establishing a blockade for the control of exports to the interior ; hut a few days later withdrew his consent on the grounds that his honour and dignity would be affected, and even a visit on February 9th from the Deputy Political Resident, Bushire, hearing a message from the Civil Commissioner, failed to change the attitude of uncompromising opposition to the blockade which he had assumed. On February 10th the s.s. “ Zayani ” was ordered by the Political Agent, Colonel R. E. A. Hamilton, not to unload her cargo, which was subsequently overcarried to Basrah. An immediate improvement in the situation took place, and on February 16th Shaikh Salim accepted the blockade proposals without reservation. On February 22nd a British blockade officer, Lieut. D. V. McCollum, and four British other ranks, landed at Kuwait to control the blockade arrangements. Though this officer nominally received every assistance, considerable obstacles were placed in his way, and there was reason to believe that goods continued to leave Kuwait, which was full of piece stuffs and piece goods ; but, as the posts were manned by the Shaikh’s retainers, no proof was forthcoming, though it was evident that while the personnel were Kuwaitis leakage was hound to continue. At the beginning of April several large caravans, aggregating 4,900 camels, purporting to be from Qasim and other eastern parts of Bin Sa £ ud’s territory, but in reality composed largely of enemy elements, or traders with the enemy, and con siderable numbers of Beduin with some 3,000 camels, had congregated at Kuwait, and asked foi* blockade permits to export very abnormal quantities of supplies of all sorts. After reference to Baghdad it was decided to refuse these requests, with the exception of a few which were properly vouched for. On April 10th, H.M. ships “ Lawrence ” (Commander L. H. Crozier) and “ Bramble ” arrived at Kuwait, and the next morning the headmen of the caravans and tribes were summoned to the Shaikh s palace to receive the answer regarding the permits. The Political Agent and the blockade officer interviewed the Shaikh, informing him of the very abnormal quantities and kinds of goods exported in the preceding 15 months, and of the still more abnormal quantities asked for by the caravans and tribes then in Kuwait. After some demur the Shaikh agreed to turn them away empty, hut when the headmen were called in his resolution failed, and the orders had eventually to be issued by the Political Agent, A letter was sent to Bin Sa‘ud explaining the matter and asking him to come to some arrangement for the future regulation of traffic with Mr. Philby (an officer of the I.C.S. deputed to Bin Sa‘ud from the staff of the Civil Commissioner), and each caravan leader was given a letter to the Amir (Goveruor) of his district explaining why he was bringing no goods. During the succeeding three days the tribes and caravans left, always passing in view of the Agency so that it could be seen that no goods were taken out. As a precaution, in view of the large numbers involved, a machine gun was placed on the Agency roof, and subsequently a second was mounted. On the last days news was received that the one remaining caravan was smuggling out arms and ammunition concealed in their saddles, and a guard of marines and bluejackets was landed, and some of the camels searched, hut without success. The turning away passed off quietly, and after waiting a short time to see if there was any chance of getting goods out by driblets the caravans betook themselves to Bin SaTid, complaining bitterly. Considerable resentment was aroused in Najd at the time, hut died down owing to the sensible attitude taken up by Bin Sa 4 ud, who now has a properly accredited representative at Kuwait to vouch for his caravans. At the same time, in order to avoid the occupation of Kuwait, it was decided to try to settle the Kuwait problem by buying up all the stocks held in Kuwait and to limit imports in order to prevent their being replaced. The effect of the action taken on April 11th was that on May 4th the Shaikh wrote a letter to the Political Agent begging that Government would extend to him the same friendship and protection as his predecessors had received and pledging himself to complete responsibility for any thing which might take place in his territory, while a marked improvement took place in the general attitude of the Shaikh’s officials. The Shaikh’s overtures were submitted to Government, but owing to some delay in their acceptance the Shaikh grew restive and the Political Agent was authorised on June 3rd to inform him that Government were giving his letter their friendly consideration and that it was hoped that Sir Percy Cox would deliver their reply on his return to Mesopotamia.439 0 g 4 The purchases on behalf of Government amounted to Bice - - - - 56,753 bags ) Wheat - - - - - 1,640 „ | Barley - - - - - 2,900 „ | to a total value Sugar - - - - 7,805 r of Coffee - - - 10,665 „ j Bs. 26,52,943/12/ Pepper - - - - 350 5 5 Tea - - - - 1,658 cases j hut purchasing 1 was stopped on June 2nd at the express request of the Shaikh to the Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah, and the Political Agent, as a personal concession to himself. It was, however, found that such enormous orders were being placed in India and in other Gulf ports to replace the stocks bought by Government that further action became necessary, and on June 12th the Shaikh was informed that these goods could not be allowed to land pending the reply of Government to his letter and that the merchants could be given the option of shipping to Basrah under permit or selling to Government at cost price, plus five per cent., any goods which the blockade officer considered should not be landed at Kuwait. On June 26th the s.s. “ Zayani ” was ordered to overcarry her cargo, which included more than 21,000 packages, mostly foodstuffs, for Kuwait. On June 24th the Political Agent represented that occupation was still the only real solution of the Kuwait question, but that, if that were not feasible, the Shaikh’s offer must be accepted at once as any capital we might hope to make out of the acceptance would be lost by further delay: discontent was rife in the town among high and low and our failure to come to a decision was looked upon as due to the weakness of our position as regards the war. On June 28th the Government of India issued orders that the Shaikh’s offer should be accepted on certain conditions, which decision was communicated to the Shaikh in the letter quoted at length hereafter, while exports from India to Kuwait were to be prohibited except on permits signed by the Political Agent or his repre sentative, and such executive action as possible was to be taken to prevent exports to Kuwait from other Gulf ports. The following statement of policy was made: While the Government of India appreciate the desirability of checking trade with Kuwait they do not consider this of sufficient importance to justify the risk of an open breach with the Shaikh and the consequent necessity of military occupation with its possible far-reaching effect on other parts of Arabia.” On July 5th the following letter (dated July 4th) was handed to Shaikh Salim by the Political Agent:— tk After compliments. I have the honour to refer to your Excellency’s letter dated May 4th, 1918 = Bajab 24th, 1336, in which you say that since olden times there existed friendship full and perfect between the British Government and the rulers of Kuwait in the time of your late father and brother, and that you ask the high Government to extend this friendship and assistance to you, and that you therefore wrote the above-mentioned letter to say that you were ready to accept full responsi bility on yourself personally for all that happened in Kuwait and its territories, like wise and that you will not allow any acts to be done in Kuwait or its territory which may be against the interests of the Government by any persons, either by your subject or tribesmen or others who may come into your territories, and that you will allow no enemies of the Government to come into Kuwait territory; and that you will be personally responsible that no goods are sent to the enemies of the Govern ment on account of the friendship between you and the Government, and you request that Government will give you the assistance of the officer now here as Blockade Officer to help you in dealing with this matter; and that you wrote this because you desire that there should be nothing but friendship and the rights of friendship between the Government and yourself. “Your letter was communicated to the Government and on June 3rd = Sha‘ban 23rd I informed Your Excellency that the Honourable Major-General Sir Percy Cox was expected to return to 'Iraq after a short time and that I hoped that he would then deliver to you the reply of Government, but he has been delayed and therefore the Government have ordered me to communicate their reply to Your Excellency, and it is as follows : — “ The British Government have deeply regretted the events of the last two years at Kuwait, but they welcome your declaration as affording an opportunity for the440 reestablishment of the traditional friendship between themselves and the rulers of Kuwait, and, in order that there maybe no misunderstanding m the tuture, tliey desire to explain their policy towards Your Excellency. “ On the one hand, should you show to Government the same friendship and assistance which they have experienced for many years m their dealings wit e rulers of Kuwait, they will continue to you the assurances given to your illustnom father, the late Shaikh Mubarak al Sabbah, especially that the town of Kuwait and ‘ its boundaries likewise belong to Shaikh Mubarak al Sabbah, Ruler oi Kuwai , ‘ and to his heirs after him,’ and will extend to you the friendship and protection and assistance which they gave to him and finally they hope that you will ag a m raise the name of your house and of Kuwait to the high position which it held m the past m the eyes of the British Government and the peoples of Aiabia. “ On the other hand, it is the plain duty of the Ruler of a State which is on terms of friendship with the Government to prevent all acts, either by his own subiects or by other persons in his territory, which may be contrary to the interests ot the Government, and since they know that, if you wish to do so, you have the power to control your subjects and others in your territory, the Government will be compelled to hold Your Excellency personally responsible should any such act unfortunately be committed in the future. They hope that you will fully realise your responsibility as the Ruler of Kuwait towards the Government under whose protection and friendship Kuwait has so greatly prospered in the past, and will understand that that prosperity depends entirely on the preservation of true friendship both m word and deed with the Government. “ Government have decided to remove the blockade provided that Y r our Excellency takes measures of your own to prevent supplies being sent to enemies of the Government, and hope that in taking these measures you will not hesitate to consult the Political Agent and Lieutenant McCollum who wall remain at Kuwait as his assistant, but in order to prevent ill-disposed persons from endeavouring to smuggle ■mods no goods will be allowed to leave India for Kuwait in future by dhow or steamer without the production of a permit signed by the Political Agent or his duly authorised representative. Government desires that full consultation should take p.ace between you and the Political Agent regirding the quantities of goods required for your territory so that the legitimate needs of your people will be safeguarded, and permits will also be granted by the Political Agent for goods which may be necessary for lawful trade with the subjects of the friend of all Shaikh Abdul Aziz ibn Abdul Rahman ibn Eaisal al Sa’ud. “ gives me great pleasure to be the bearer of this message on behalf of Government and I trust that the friendship between us may increase. This is what had to be said and may you be preserved.” In a long interview, characterised by very plain speaking, the various points of the letter were discussed and the situation was made perfectly clear to Shaikh Salim who vowed friendship and professed to consider Government’s word as his laAV He issued a notice proclaiming his friendship and that anyone acting against Government in word or deed would have his property taken and be banished from Kuwait. He was rather frightened of personal responsibility, and expressed fear of our listening- to tale-bearers, on which point he was reassured. On July 7th Shaikh Salim replied in writing to the same effect, and a meeting was held between the Political Agent and the Blockade Officer and representatives of the Shaikh headed by the latter’s son, ‘ Abdullah, who was appointed to superintend the whole blockade ami in particular to deal with exports by land. It was decided that a manifest system should be instituted to check the exports by sea and that the existing system of checking exports by land should be continued. Stress was laid on the point that far more good would be done by Shaikh‘Abdullah s going round Kuwait and turning out any enemy elements than by any amount of written passes. Though arrangements for the issue of passes were made immediately after the delivery of the above letter to the Shaikh (5th July), no applications for passes were received before September 2nd. This was due to opposition on the part of the Shaikh, in the vain attempt to get us to withdraw the restrictions on imports which we had just instituted. Seeing, however, that it was useless to hold out further he gave in and applications came forward, .slowly at first, but freely afterwards.It is worthy of note that the opposition above referred to ceased a few days after the deportation of Yusuf al Duwairi (August 29th), elsewhere referred to in this report. Blockade restrictions were formally withdrawn on 3rd November under orders of Gr.H.Q. on conclusion of the armistice with Turkey, hut the shipping restrictions as regards exports from India to Kuwait were still in force at the close of the year. Deportation of Yusuf al Duwairi .—Bor a long time it had been recognised that the influence of a man named Yusuf ibu Muhammad al Minis (commonly called Yusuf al Duwairi) was one of the most anti-British forces in Kuwait, and Shaikh Salim’s succession placed him in full power. He had acted as Shaikh Salim’s jackal during the long years of his exile in the desert, and received his reward in the great influence he exerted over Shaikh Salim and the power this influence gave him in the town, where he was much disliked and even hated. No favourable opportunity was found of removing him. till Shaikh Salim made . his declaration of July 5th, 1918, that he would banish anyone acting against the British Government in word or deed. . On August 26th the matter was broached and on the 27th Shaikh Salim consented to send Yusuf al Duwairi to Bombay, where he was to receive quarters and a subsistence allowance; the next day, however, he endeavoured to beg him off on various pretexts and suggested among other things that he be sent to Bahrain or Hasa, or to Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair, to whom he is said to be related on the female side. The Civil Commissioner authorised the Political Agent to order the Shaikh to deport Yusuf al Duwairi if his advice were not accepted and telegraphed to the Shaikh advising him to comply with the Political Agent’s “ authoritative advice.” The Shaikh was very unwilling to take action even after the receipt of the Civil Commissioner’s message, but _ his advisers persuaded him that resistance was useless and Yusuf al Duwairi left in the B.M.S. Palitana on August 29th. Fearl Fishery .—The Kuwait pearling fleet returned from the banks during the first half of October. There were only 328 boats from Kuwait engaged in the fisheries in 1918 as against approximately 450, 500, and 600 in 1917, 1916, and 1915 respectively, The decrease in the number of boats is said to be due to the usual crews from Basrah and Nejd not arriving, as they had more profitable employment elsewhere. The takings were said to be only about three-fourths of what they were in 1917. . . „ . , An exceptionallv good pearl, said to he about the size of a pigeon s egg, was got by ‘Abdullah bin Ya‘qut of Kuwait. It was sold for Bs. 1,10,000 to Hamad bin ‘Ali Zayani of Bahrain, who was subsequently offered Bs. H lakhs for it by Shamlan of Kuwait, but would not accept it. The pearl is said to be worth Bs. 2,20,000. Arms Traffic .—Beports are still being received from different sources about the smuggling of arms and ammunition from Kuwait into Tangistan on the Persian OOctst; On 4th October reliable news was received here that certain Tangistanis sailed from here the previous night with ammunition for Tangistan. On 26th November the Vice-Consul Bushire, was informed by the Provincial Director of Customs, Bushire of a report received by the latter that 40 rifles and 50,000 cartridges from Kuwait’were landed at Dilvar (Tangistan) about the 20th November. Rewards have been offered here for the apprehension of arms smugglers, houses been searched by the Shaikh in company with the Political Agent, and the local director of Customs is continually on the look-out, but up to the present it has been impossible to lay hands on any of the smugglers. 2. Revenue.— The Shaikh’s principal sources of revenue are:- 1. Customs. 2. Pearl fishery. 3. Private property. Revenue derived from the customs has suffered a great deal in t rie year under •eview owing to the blockade restrictions which were in force To compensate the ■Shaikh for this the Government of India gave him a piesent of Rs. 3,00,000, and lave forgone the loan of Rs. 1,87,500 which was made him in 1915 for the erection 51 ^ThT^iafkh claims one diver’s share in each Kuwait pearling boat. r rhp qiioikb owns several large date gardens at lao and Basrah, which bring lim an annual revenue of about Bs. 7,09,000. H h442 3. Irrigation. —The land around Kuwait is rich and admirably suited to irrigation, hut is dependent on we]Is, of which there are not many, as a source of supply. Irrigation is therefore confined to a few centres where water is found. 4. Agriculture. —The area under cultivation is small owing to the scarcity of water. The principal cultivation centres are Jaharah, Hawalli, and a few villages along the Qusur coast. Wheat and barley are sown in the open desert in the rainy season and under favourable conditions as much as 60 tons is got in this way. Small quantities of vegetables are brought into Kuwait town from the surrounding villages, hut the town is dependent principally on the Shatt-al-Arab gardens for its green stuffs. 5. Municipalities. —These do not exist in Kuwait. 6. Judicial. —Justice is administered by the Shaikh, in the most arbitrary way, and his word is law. The Political Agent is not vested with judicial powers, and cases of British subjects are, therefore, settled by him informally, and those between British subjects and Arabs are referred to the Shaikh for equitable settlement. There has been very little serious crime in the town during the year. 7. Education. —Except for the Day and Night School conducted by the Bev. Mr. Calverley of the American Mission, there are no educational facilities outside those offered in the Quranic Schools, which here, as in other places, only teach a sufficiency of Arabic to enable the pupils to read the Quran. The Mission School did a lot of excellent work during the year, and great credit is due to the Bev. Mr. Calverley, who, in spite of being left without a teacher, due to the inducements of high pay offered by the Government in ‘Iraq, succeeded in bringing the average daily attendance to 16—a much higher figure than in former years—and worked very hard himself in the schools. 8. Medical and Sanitation : Medical. —The Agency dispensary closed on 1st September, on Honorary-Lieut. C. C. Kelly, I.S.M.D., who had been in charge of it, being posted to India for duty. Erom January 1st to August 31st, 1,714 outpatients were treated. There were 155 operations and 25 vaccinations. Eor the work done by the American Mission Hospital, see Appendix II. Sanitation. —No sanitary arrangements exist in Kuwait, and there is no idea of systematic conservancy. Those who live near the seashore use it for the purpose of nature; the inhabitants of the outskirts use the open desert, and those of the central quarters their house-tops, or pits dug on the roadside, or, in the less frequented quarters, the roadside itself. Here refuse matter is allowed to accumulate. There are no scavengers, hut the principal streets are generally fairly clean, being swept by the breeze which blows intermittently almost throughout the year. 9. Police. —The Shaikh does not keep special men for police work, but uses his retainers for this purpose whenever required. In addition to these there are about 60 night guards, mostly Beloochies from the Mel ran coast, for watching the shops at night. 10. Shabanahs. —Nil. 11. Labour.— Is expensive in Kuwait. The following are the present rates of daily wages for the different handicrafts :— Head mason - Assistant mason Master carpenter Assistant carpenter Nail driver Coolie - - Bs. 10/- 5/- 10 /- 5/- to 6/- 3/- to 4/- 2/- to 2/8/- The above rates were 50 to 75 per cent, lower before the war. There are about 300 Persian coolies in Kuwait and about 200 Najdi labourers. Some 542 labourers were sent to the Labour Corps, Basrah, in 1917 and 1918. 12. Miscellaneous. The Deputy Political Besident, Bushire, arrived in Kuwait by H.M.S. “ Muzaffar ” on Eebruary 9th, and left on the 11th idem. The Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah, Lieut.-Col. E. B. Howell, arrived from Basrah on 31st May, and left on the 2nd June.^ E ' S ^ h Sir Kha zal Khan, G.C.I.E, K.C.S.I., arriyed in Kuwait on Jbtn June and left on August 21st.

Gunter, Esquire, Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs, visited Kuwait on November 27th, and left for Bushire on 28th idem. Pilgrimage. Shaikh Ahmed ibn Jabir (nephew of Shaikh Salim) with a large number of retainers, and other pilgrims, numbering about 1,500, left Kuwait on August 8th for Mecca and arrived back on October 29th. The journey each way, exclusive of halts, took 32 days. They were very pleased with the reception given them by the Sharif, but state that while travelling through his territory they were harassed the whole time, whereas in Bin Sa‘ud’s country there was absolutely order and safety. Water Plant .—Arrangements have at length been made for the working of the Kuwait water plant. It is hoped that it will commence continuous work during the next month. 13. Establishment and Personnel. —The charge of the Political Agency continued to be held by Lieut.-Colonel 11. E. A. Hamilton to the afternoon of 15th March, when he proceeded on combined leave, and was relieved by Captain P. G. Loch. The latter proceeded on privilege leave on 19th September, handing over charge of the current duties to Captain D. Y. McCollum, who remained in office till the close of the year. Hon. Lieut. C. C. Kelly, I.S.M.D., continued to be in medical charge of the agency and quarantine arrangements to the 1st September 1918. He was transferred to India and his duties here were taken over temporarily by Dr. C. S. G. Mylrea of the American Mission. D. Y. McCollum, Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait. APPENDICES. APPENDIX A. THE ‘AJMAN QUESTION. At the end of 1914 fighting took place between Bin Sa‘ud and Ibn Kashid which was indecisive and ended in a truce. Amongst the tribes which had collected ostensibly for the support of Bin Sa‘ud on this occasion was the ‘Ajman, a Beduin tribe from Hasa, which failed to appear at the appointed time and was therefore suspected of treachery. Later they committed certain depreda tions and gave refuge to some rebellious cousins of Bin Sa‘ud known as the Araif, and in June 1915 Bin Sa‘ud decided to organise a campaign against them. He solicited aid from Kuwait and Sir Mubarak despatched a strong force of local tribesmen under his son, Shaikh Salim; but before their arrival Bin Sa‘ud made a night attack on the ‘Ajman, for which they were prepared, and was defeated losing his brother Sa‘ad among the killed. Later, however, with the aid of Sir Mubarak’s force he managed to hem in the ‘Ajman near the coast, a short distance north of Qatif. Here they were besieged for some little time, at the end of which they were badly defeated by the Bani Khalid and other Kuwait tribes in an attempt to break through, and then, despairing of escape, opened negotiations for peace with Shaikh Salim, who sent them to Kuwait, where their submission was accepted by Sir Mubarak against the wishes of Bin Sa‘ud, who desired further to avenge the death of his brother. This happened early in November 1915, and on the death of Sir Mubarak, which took place at the end of the month, his successor, Shaikh Jabir, in order to placate Bin Sa‘ud ejected the ‘Ajman from Kuwait territory and they dispersed, the majority making for the north west, as they feared to return to their former haunts in Hasa. The asylum given to the ‘Ajman tribe was one of the important factors leading to the unfortunate estrangement which has lately existed between Najd and Kuwait. In November 1916 a meeting took place at Kuwait between the three great chiefs of north-east Arabia, Bin Sa‘ud, Shaikh Jabir and the Shaikh of Muhammarah, under the aegis of the chief Political Officer, at which they openly declared their allegiance to the British Government. As one of the results of tins meeting a truce was arranged4*44 between Bin Sa‘ud and the ‘Ajman, who were then living with friendly tribes on the borders of the occupied territory, and instructions were drafted defining the position of the fugitive Shaikhs with respect to all the tribes under the protection of the Btitish Grovernment. On his return to Basrah the Chief Political Officer summoned the ‘Ajman leaders, and some of the more courageous came in to Zubair and the proposed terms were accepted. They expressed little doubt that the rest would come in on learning of the success of their own venture. Sultan, ibn Hithlain gave a written undertaking that the tribe would not leave our territory without permission, but they eventually went off to Ibn Rashid. . , In February 1917, Shaikh Jabir died and Salim reigned in his stead. In the middle of 1917 Bin Sated, who had already begun to tax the ‘Awazim, an essentially Kuwait tribe, induced them to leave Kuwait and settle in his own territory. Shaikh Salim’s reply to this move was to make advances to the Shammar and ‘ Ajman and by the beginning of October, 1917, the latter had moved “ en masse” into Kuwait territory. Much correspondence took place between the two rulers, but Bin Sated refused to restore the ‘Awazim, and, when Colonel Hamilton, political argent, Kuwait, visited Najd, he claimed that he was within his rights in his action in connection with this tribe. However, knowing that he was really in the wrong, he expressed himself ready to return the filched tribe if Shaikh Salim would turn out the ‘Ajman and cut off his relations with the Shammar, the enemies of himself and the British Government. Eventually an understanding was arrived at on these lines and the ‘Awazim were returned. Despite this the ‘Ajman remained, in Kuwait territory, and at the beginning of 1918 the disposal of this tribe had become a burning question. In February, 191.8, it was decided that the most satisfactory settlement of the matter would be for the British Government to take the ‘Ajman under their protection at Zubair or elsewhere on the Shamiyah side, and on March 6th, 1918, the following agreement was signed by the political agent (Colonel Hamilton), Shaikh Salim, and Dhaidan ibn Hithlain, the leading ‘Ajman Shaikh). “ After consulting the wishes of their friend and ally H. E. ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Sated, Imam of Riyadh and Hakim of Najd, Hasa and its Dependancies, “ After paying due regard to the intercession on their behalf of H E. Shaikh Salim al Mubarak, Hakim of the Sultanate of Kuwait and its dependancies, in whose territory and under whose pro tection the tribe of ‘Ajman are now dwelling, and having regard to the general policy of friendliness of the British Government towards the rulers, tribes and people of ‘Iraq and the Jazirat-al-Arab, it has seemed good to the British Government to overlook the breach of the agreement made last year with Sultan ibn Hithlain and some sections of the ‘Ajman and to enter into relations with this tribe for the second time : Therefore the British Government is willing to accept the submission of the ‘Ajman and to take them under its protection for the period of one year, or until the end of the war, on the conditions undermentioned :— “ (i) That Dhaidan ibn Hithlain, Sultan ibn Hithlain and all the Shaikhs of the ‘Ajman tribe now settled in Kuwait territories do subscribe in writing to this underiaking. “ (ii) That the ‘Ajman tribe will remove its encampment to within territories occupied or administered by the British Forces and will settle in a locality appointed by the British political authorities. “ (iii) That the ‘Ajman will not re-enter Kuwait territory or market in Kuwait (which must be regarded as absolutely out of bounds for the tribe) without permission of the British Officer in political charge of them and after notice has been previously given to H. E. Shaikh of Kuwait. “ (iv) That immediately after the execution of this undertaking by them, the ‘Ajman tribe will move in the direction of Zubair and await orders as to their destination. “ (v) If and when these terms have been subscribed to by Shaikhs Dhaidan ibn Hithlain, Sultan bin Hithlain and other sectional chiefs of the tribe, the British Government will extend to them the same measure of protection and place them on exactly the same allowances as in the case of Ibn Suwait and the Dhafir tribe. “ Note .—It should be understood that these restrictions do not refer to individuals of the ‘A jman tribe such as fidaiyiah, pearlers, and others of the tribe engaged in similar industries whose liveli hood is obtained in Kuwait. But the prohibition is absolutely in regard to the principal Shaikhs’ sections and their tribal followings.” After some delay the tribe took up their residence at Shuwaibdah, north of Zubair, but since then much raiding lias taken place between them and the Mutair and Bani Hajir, and they have also raided a number of Bin Sated’s caravans in Kuwait territory. Until the acceptance by the British Government in July, 1918, of certain friendly overtures made by Shaikh Salim, he did nothing to prevent this raiding in spite of the agreement on the subject. Bin Sated strongly resented this and represented that in this and other matters his interests were not being properly looked after by Government, and in August it was decided that a British post should be established to guard the Safwan wells, that Shaikh Salim should guard Jaharah and other Kuwait watering places, while, with his consent, Bin Sated was to be authorised to occupy Hafar on the boundary of Kuwait territory. In addition, hostages were to be taken from the leading Sheikhs of the ‘Ajman (and also from certain friendly Shammar who were implicated in the raiding) and further raiding be punished by stoppage of supplies. It was, however, subsequently decided not to occupy Safwan nor to take hostages, but the ‘Ajman were warned that if the raiding continued their small subsidies would be finally discontinued, they would be refused supplies, and thrown open to Bin Sated’s vengeance. At the same time Bin Sated was informed that he was at liberty, so far as we were concerned, to take action against them provided the safety of the Basrah-Nasiriyah Railway was not endangered and hostilities with Kuwait principality were not involved.APPENDIX B. THE AMERICAN MISSION. In two branches of their work in which the Administration is concerned, viz., medical and educational, the American Mission has done splendid work in the past year. The medical work for men continues to show progress, and this year has seen the doctor welcomed practically everywhere. The few men who held out against the Mission so many years have lately opened their doors—the last surrender being Shamlan, who has during the last two months availed himself of the services both of Mrs. (Dr.) Calverley on behalf of his harim, and of Dr. Mylrea on behalf of his small grandson. So that while last year’s report read “Most of “ the men of influence in Kuwait make use of the Mission doctors,” this year it should read “ Practically all.” Shaikh Salim broke his long silence on October 11th when he at last called on Dr. Mylrea, inspected the hospital, and took the doctor home to lunch with him. On December 14th, the Shaikh accepted an invitation to lunch with Dr. Mylrea, and afterwards presented him with a piece of land adjoining and to the south of the Mission compound. This piece of land, which will be a valuable addition to the Mission’s property, was promised to the Mission some two years ago by Shaikh Jabir, but Salim was in no hurry to fulfil his brother’s promises. Shaikh Khaz‘al, of Muhammarah, during his stay in Kuwait has been very friendly. He has given the Mission a special donation to be used in putting down clay on the roads bordering on and leading to the hospital. This will be a great improvement, for the deep soft sand was very trying to sick people walking to the hospital in the hot weather. Towards the end of October Kuwait was visited by an epidemic of influenza ; hardly a house escaped, and most of the cases complicated by pneumonia terminated fatally. The estimated mortality runs as high as 4,000—this estimate is possibly too high. In the month of November Dr. Mylrea made 238 professional visits. By the beginning of December the epidemic had spent itself. Hospital statistics are as follows 2,992 new cases and 8,365 repeat treatments; 379 professional visits were made to patients in their houses; 110 in-patients were received into the wards; 46 major operations and 148 minor operations; 50 intravenous injections for venereal disease. The Dispensary for Women treated 1,300 new cases, with 2,387 repeat treatments; 70 professional visits were made to patients in their houses; 8 in-patients were admitted into the female ward; 7 major operations and 71 minor operations were performed. Noife—The statistics date from November 1st, 1917, to October 31st, 1918.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000912.0x0000ab_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/250</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000912.0x0000ab</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/250</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Reports of administration for 1918 of divisions and districts of the occupied territories in Mesopotamia.
