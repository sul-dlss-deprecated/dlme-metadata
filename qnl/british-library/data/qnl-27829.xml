When we instructed him originally to consult the Political Resident as to the possibility of obtaining the deletion of the drilling obligation, we offered the postponement as an alternative. Our reason for prefering the deletion of the obligation was that no similar obligation is contained in the other Concessions held by us on the Trucial Coast and we preferred, for economic reasons, to be fr#e to locate our first test wells on structures, wherever situated, which geological and geophysical survey indicated to be the most favourable. For this purpose, we have obtained sufficient dollar —.- exchange from H.M. Treasury to enable us to employ American rTV^geophysists equipped with the most modern instruments and ’L' l methods. Naturally we wish to obtain the fullest possible value from the expenditure of Dollar Exchange and therefore wished to have a free hand as to where the first wells would be located. We also had in mind the uncertainty as regards the inter-State boundaries *on the Trucial Coast and the 7 ’ areas (such as Biraimi) in which the coastal Shaikhs have ^ control or influence. i However, an extension of six years will give us ample4 latitude, as we hope to be in a position both as regards the siting o± the first test wells and the supply of drilling equipment (some of which is now on order) to spud in our first well in 2/3 years from now, providing that no unforeseen difficulties arise preventing the free movement of our survey parties in the Trucial Coast area generally. A small party of geologists is now at work on the Trucial Coast preparing the way for the larger Geophysical Parties next year and, we' hope, making contacts which will enable such parties to obtain the maximum possible information during next working season.

If the period of 9 years stipulated above is expired and the Company did not do geological examination and field work etc. constantly with every diligence and activity then the Agreement shall be annulled” As you are doubtless aware geological explora tion on the frucial Coast was suspended during the war and without this essential prelude the commence ment of drilling cannot be justified. As you know the Company has already approached the Ruler of Sharjah with a view to resumption of geological work in the Jabal Faiyah area to commence in January 1946, but 6 years have been lost and the period allowed expires in September 1946. In these circumstances, we have been instructed by our Managing Director to approach the Ruler of Sharjah with a view to the cancellation of the drilling obligatior vide the abovementioned paragraph B. It is proposed that Mr. Lermitte should proceed shortly to Sharjah to arrange this cancellation. Copies of the letter to the Shaikh and the form of agreement he is to take with him are enclosed. You will note that provision has been made for a payment to the Ruler in return for the cancellation if this proves necessary.

INDIA OFFICE, , ^ Jaauary, 1946 . / i9 We understand from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulr that your Bahrein manager has been instructed to start negotiations with the Sheikh of Sharjah for the cancellation of paragraph B of Schedule No* 1 to your Sharjah Oil Concession agreement, with the object of relieving your Company of obligation to drill within &amp; stipulated period. We understand that it will be difficult, if not inroossible. for the Company to do any drilling before September this year when the present time-limit expires. We should prefer, however, that you should arrange with the Sheikh for the extension of the period for, say, up to another six years, to cover the war-time period of enforced inactivity, rather than attempt to persuade him to relieve the Company of all obligations in this connection. Would you kindly let me know whether your Company would be prepared to send revised instructions to your Bahrein manager in the above sense? H. H» Wheatley, Esq.Any reply to be addressed :— The Secretary. Telegrams: Telephone: Abbey 7000. “Minfupo, Sowest, London.” Petroleum Division, 7, Millbank, London, S.W.l. Reference: ^ January, 1946 Your Reference • 157 /45. 14 Dea* Donaldson, Thanks for your letter of the 11th January enclosing a telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about the Oil Concession in Sharjah. S’rom the point of view of the I.P.C. people, Sharjah is a goat among their sheep in the Persian Gulf, because it is the only territory in which their oil rights include an obligation to drill within a specified period or else clear out. This, no doubt, is the reason for their opening negotiations on the basis of substituting an indefinite development programme for this specific obligation. If the Political Resident is not in favour of this proposal by the Company we should certainly not object to the alternative he suggests, of obtaining an extension for a further 6 years representing the enforced inactivity of the war period. I also have reason to think that the Company will accept this. As regards your remarks concerning the Company’s exploration party in the Jebel Faiyah area, I think the Company oan appreciate that this area is within the territory claimed by the Sheik of Sharjah but I believe that this part of thb world is a subject of conflicting claims by different neighbouring rulers.* Also, I should think that the exploration party is unlikely to do any work which would relieve the Company^toat; their drilling obligation which falls due for execution by September this year. I am sending a copy of' this letter to Free se-Penne fat her at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, E.P. Donaldson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall. S.W.l. AL,fjrV- ^j( ■ (V) ivfr : &gt;elow. Please see the Political Residents telegram No.23 trr»k* i* Paragraph B of Schedule 1 of the Sharjah Oil Concession reads as follows: - 'The period allowed within which drilling shall begin is that of 9 calendar years from the date of signature of the Concession Agreement. If the peri 9 d of 9 years stipulated above is expired and the Company df^ not d^^eological examination and field work, etc. constantly with every diligence and activity then the agreement shall be annulled'. The date of the Concession was 17th September, 1937. j-fae action of the Company in proposing to cancel this provision is rather strange since the Jebel Faiyah area (to which the Company are, according to our information, proposing to send a survey party this month and of which they have hopes as an oil producing area) lies within the territory claimed by the Sheikh of Sharjah, although it is not within his effective Jurisdiction.. Before taking the matter up with the Company we might consult the Petroleum Division as in the attached draft.Ext# 157/tf b DRAFT LETsSt r'- K#L*Stock, Esq# , Ministry of Fuel and Power# 11 IP 1946 (io. 13 ).

I am now able to confirm that the text accepted by the Sheikh is that of the Debai Political Agreement which was signed on the 5th February 1937. Sir Trenchard Fowle considers that it would be most inadvisable at this stage to reopen the matter with the Sheikh, and on his recommendation it is proposed, if the Company see no objection, to conclude the Shargah agreement in the Debai form. The subsequent exchange of notes would of course also be the same as those exchanged with the Sheikh of Debai. We shall be glad to learn as soon as possible whether the above proposals are acceptable/^ 'AAs CcaA*C4**+*J , Youro 6fn66i*efy. f8gd.) J. P.

We ha^Frrow received a further telegram from the Acting Political Resident, stating that the text accepted by the Sheikh is that of the Debai Political Agreement which was signed on the 5th February, and it would, therefore, appear that not even the amendments &gt; introduced into the earlier draft enclosed with Clauson’s letter to Lewisohn of the 31st May have been put to the Sheikh. 3. Apart from the amendment to the Preamble (which was made at the Company’s suggestion) the amendments introduced into the earlier draft were based on suggestions contained in Beckett’s note of the 4th December, 1936, on the subject of the Debai Agreement (copy of which was' enclosed with your d.o. letter to Clauson of the 10th December, 1936); but as none appear to be of vital importance v/e are inclined to think that, having regard to the recommendation in Caroe’s telegram '.)]o .

This seems a little odd in view of the correspondence beginning with the Resident’s telegram of the 4th July at P.Z.437C/37, but as none of the amendments introduced into the original Sharjah draft are of vital importance (the majority are based on suggestions contained in Beckett’s note of the 4th December, 1935, on the subject of the Debai Agreement - see flag ’X’ in lower file) we might, if the Company agree, conclude the Agreement in the form used for the Debai Agreement. I mentioned the point to Mr.Longrigg on the telephone yesterday and gathered that the Company arenot likely to object; but before seeking their formal concurrence we should, I think, make sure that the Foreign Office have no objection to the course proposed. If you agree perhaps I might write to Hr.Brenan (with whom I have already discussed) on the lines of the attached draft.03$ (P.Z. 6410/37) r PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED, City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, London, E.C.2 27th September, 1937.

My dear Seal, Would you kindly refer to Bushire telegram of the 12th July, No.728, of which a copy was sent to the Admiralty on the 13th July, 1937, numbered P.Z.4578/37, regarding the reluctance of the Sheikh of Shargah to accept the Political conditions necessary for His Majesty's Governments approval of any oil concession# 2. It appears that the Sheikh objects to paragraph 3(a) of the first letter in the Exchange of Notes, addressed by the Political Agent to the Ruler, which runs as follows:~ ”Should any of the terms of the Agreement between you and the Company be inconsistent or in conflict with the terms of the Agreement between the Company and His Majesty T s Government signed in London on 'b ri0 Agreement between you and the Company will to the extent of any such inconsistency or conflict be subordinate to and be controlled by the terms of the Agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government.' 3. It has now been suggested by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. that it might resolve the deadlock with the Sheikh of Shargah if E. A. Seal, Esq., Admiralty, S. W. 1.&lt;- / 2 . this clause were modified in such a way as not to wound his pride, since it appears that what he really objects to is the '‘^'Arabic equivalent of the word ”controlled”. 4.

It appears that the Sheikh objects to paragraph 3(a) of the first letter in the Exchange of Notes, addressed by the Political Agent to the Ruler, which runs as follows:- 'Should any of the terms JSf~. ... the Company and His Majesty’s Government.' 3. It has now been suggested by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., that it might resolve the deadlock with the Sheikh of Shargah if this clause were modified in such a way as not to wound his pride, since it appears that what he really objects to is the Arabic equivalent of the word 'controlled'. 4« The paragraph in question is of course aj, vii-al one from His Majesty’s A Government/2 .

As you will see, there are the following differences from the draft as sent to Lewisohn with my letter of 26th May. In Article 3 we do not quite like the wording of the Company's suggestion, and we think it will be simplest merely to provide for the consent of His Majesty's Government or of the political nesident to be given, leaving us to decide which consent shall be given in which cases.

The end of Article 6 has been altered, since its appearance in the form sent to the Company on 25th May was the result of a misunderstanding here. The present form is the same as the Debai form, with the wording made slightly more precise. The reference to instructions by the Political Resident relates, of course, to the period before general regulations are made by the Sheikh (at present, of course, there are no general aircraft regulations on the Trucial Coast similar to those in Bahrein). In Article 7 we have introduced the first of the Company’s suggested amendments but not the second, which does not seem to us to fit, since the sites in question are in no way comparable to harbours. We have, however, inserted a reference to the use of aerodromes or seaplane bases. I think you will find that this article satisfactorily effects what Lewisohn’s suggested amendments were intended to effect. We have omitted Article 11 on the advice of our legal people, who have pointed out that it is really superfluous/superfluous, since the relationship between the commercial concession and the political agreement is primarily laid down in the exchange of notes and it would be tidier to have the whole thing done in the exchange of notes. Article 11 being emitted from the political agreement, it will merely be necessary to alter paragraph 3 (b) of the relevant draft note to the Sheikh so that the sentence in brackets will read 'which it is nerebp agreed shall be applicable to the case' instead of 'which is made applicable to the case by Article 11 of tne agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government”. As regards the amendment suggested by the Company in subclause (4) of the pre-emption clause, His Majesty’s Government prefer not to make this addition. Chilst there is no disposition on their part to suggest that a transfei price for oil sold to shareholders at a privileged rats would represent 'a fair price' for preemption purposes, they are anxious not to debar in advance any person wno might be charged with the duty of xixing a lair price from access to all da,ta which might possibly be relevant.The exchange of notes would he the same as those exchanged with the Sheikh of Dehai, subject to the amendment noted above, except that it will be unnecessary to bring in Petroleum Concessions Limited, as the political agreement in the present instance is with Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited. Will you kindly confirm that the Company have no further observations to make in regard to these documents ? Meanwhile the necessary steps are being taken to seek authority for the signature of the political agreement on behalf of His Majesty’s Government by an Under-Secretary at this Office. As I have informed you orally in reply to your enquiries, we understand from the Political Resident that it is the case that the Sheikh of Sharjah is raising difficulties over his recognition of the political agreement and over the exchange of notes.

S.H. Dear Mr. Longrigg, Would you kindly refer to your letter of the 23rd July, No.420, regarding your Company T s negotiations on the Trucial Coast. Mr. Clauson’s communication to you on the telephone was based on a telegram from Sir Trenchard Fowle in which he suggested that the Company could now safely postpone further negotiations until October, when the weather improves, and that the Comoany should inform the remaining Trucial Sheikhs accordingly. Since the receipt of that telegram we have received a further telegram from the Resident to the effect that he has received a report from the Political Agent, Bahrein, that the Company wish Mr. Lermitte to proceed to Abu Dhabi, Ras-al-Khaimah and Ajman as soon as possible. Sir Trenchard Fowle adds that he has telegraphed to the Political Agent that he has no objection. The position thus is that the Resident, while originally suggesting postponement till October, has no objection/ Longrigg, Esq., Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., City Gate House, Finsbury Square, E.C.2.2 . objection to negotiations 'being carried on forthwith if the Company so desire. v/e see no reason to dissent from his views, and it seems to us that the matter is one for the Company to decide in accordance with their own convenience. As regards the situation at Shargah, it is understood that the Sheikh is showing reluctance to accept the principles of the Political Agreement in their application to the commercial concession as laid down in the Exchange of Notes. The local authorities are in communication with him on this point, his acceptance is of course essential before the approval of His Majesty’s Government can be given to any oil concession which he may grant to any Company.

We are not, of course, concerned with the actual terms of the commercial concession, provided they do not affect the political interests of H.M.G. and provided they are reasonably fair to the Sheikh concerned. It appears that the shargah concession is practically the same as the Debai Concession, which is flagged on the file below. The changes, none of them of importance, are noted in the margin. It is therefore clearly unobjectionable. The procedure is that the commercial concession is signed between the Sheikh and the Company with a proviso that it is 'subject to the approval of H.M.G.' The approval of H.M.G. is contingent on the signature of the 'political agreement' by the Company and the acceptance by the Sheikh, in an exchange of notes, of the provisions of the Political Agreement in so far as they affect him, and of the overriding validity of the political Agreement I in any matter in which it may conflict with the Commercial concession. A draft political Agreement is ready (flag A in red ink) which is the same substantially as the Debai political/ K0C3 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 101’■ mm political agreement, but incorporates drafting improvements which have been suggested by Mr. Beckett of the Foreign Office, Legal Adviser 1 s Department and by the company themselves. The changes are indicated: they appear to be large, but actually they are not substantial. The other departments concerned are content with the draft as it now stands. It should be noted that one point is outstanding in connection with the Draft Political Agreement. The Company suggested an amendment of the Pre-emption clause in that Agreement (noted in pencil in the copy at flag C) designed to ensure that in fixing a price for pre-emption of oil by H.M.G. in time of war or emergency regard should not be paid to prices at which the Company may have been selling its oil to its own shareholders (i.e. the component parts of the Iraq petroleum Company) at privileged rates. The Admiralty do not like this, and we are going back to the Companyfon it (please see letter to Mr. Seal at Flag D). It is hoped that the Company will drop this proposal. The Exchange of Notes will be practically identical 3 »h JL.7 a* fin with the Debai Exchange of Notes flagged /6elow. a few minor necessary changes are marginally noted. It is nowjine cess ary to secure the formal concurrence of the other Departments in the signature of the Political Agreement and Exchange of Notes. Draft letters for this purpose are submitted. It may also be noted parenthetically that according to recent reports (political Residents telegram of the 12th July, P.Z.4578/37) the Sheikh of Shargah is jibbing at the Exchange of Notes. pressure by the local political authorities should suffice to remove his objections. Aftef all, he cannot grant a concession without H.M.G.’s consent, and H.M.G. 1 s consent will not be given - nor consequently will he be able to get his money from the company - until f he agrees to the political requirements of H.M.G.

This Concession will be on the same lines as the Debai Concession and no objection need be taken to its terms by H.M.G. 3. It is accordingly proposed to conclude wioh the Company a 'Shargah Political Agreement' on the same lines as the Debai Political Agreement, with certain amendments which have been the subject of inter-departmental discussion. A copy of the draft Agreement in its final form is enclosed.4. After the signature of the Political Agreement it is proposed to exchange notes with the Sheikh and the Company which will be substantially identical with the notes approved in the case of Debai. 5.

The reference to instructions by the Political Resident refers to the period before general regulations are made by the Sheikh (at present, of coarse, there are no general aircraft regulations on the Truexal Coast . In Article • we have introduced the first of the Company’s suggested amendments, but not the second, which does not seem to fit/fit, since the sites in question are in no way # (#&lt; fvHH t\AAMAHA*- iaaS'OvCc^ comparable to harbours ( Company it, we ■ -n i pr 'p' °^ ^ ^^ny i mf .1^4 -1 -n a reference to the use of aerodromes or seaplane bases).

As regards the amendment suggested by the Company in subclause (iv) of the pre-emption clause, we understand that the Admiralty see objection to the suggested addition, and we are proposing to leave the clause as it stands. We have now, I think, covered all Beckett’s points except that in regard to Article 10. In regard to this article we recognise that the wording may not be ideal from the legal point of view, but on political grounds we feel it is to retain the wording as it stands, particularly as it has been already accepted by the Company, who in the exchange of notes agree that in any conflict between the commercial concession and political agreement the latter shallprevail.

You will observe from these the lengths to which we have gone in meeting the wishes of the Shaikh of Sharjah, from whose signature nothing now appears to separate us, provided that he does not develop any additional demands. The fact that he seems to have declared his demands to Political on the spot may make it more difficult for him now to increase them. At the moment, therefore, we hope to conclude with Sharjah without further hitch, and to proceed there after to Has—al—Khaimah. We understand that Ajman and Umm-al-Quwain have no hinterland, and we should^probably be prepared to sign concessions with them only if they are content with modest sums. Yours sincerely.

If the Shaikh proves a reliable negotiator, and does not produce additional last minute demands, it seems that the difference between us is now not The revised offer implied in our telegram serious. The revised ofxer implied m our ueiegrcou of to-day represents an advance, to a certain extent on the offer' which the Shaikh of Dubai accepted and signed: to improve the offer still further, e.g. by additional financial inducement, would appear to us both unjust to the Shaikh of Dubai and dangerous as a precedent for the other Trucial Rulers.

If you agree we would propose to telegraph to the Resident that he may have discretion to communicate as and when necessary with the various Sheikhs on these (m We would also suggest to Longrigg that he should go immediately to the Gulf and &amp; keep in&gt; touch with Powle, and, moreover, that he should be prepared to make such generous financial offers to the various Sheikhs as would justify Powle in regarding the offers as completely satisfactory from the point Ut'i' f of view of the Sheikhs. ^ ^ We have considered whether we should be discriminating unfairly against the Standard Oil Company if we acted on these lines.

CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON • E.C.2 3rd June, 1957- ,, 1/ Dear Mr. Clauson. Your letter P.Z.2910/37 dated the 26 th May. The verbal amendments which you have suggested in the common form of the Political Agreements to be made between H.M.G. and the Company in respect of future oil concessions in the Persian Gulf have been duly considered and found to be unobjectionable. The Company has three small amendments to suggest. Clause 3. It is suggested that the words 'foreign^ native labour' might conceivably give offence, and that 'hhey should be replaced by the words 'artizans or other workers not indigenous to 11 o Clause 7 . It is suggested that there is no valid^ teason for excluding from the concession area sites selected for defence purposes, etc., provided the Com pany is precluded from occupying the surface thereof except with the specific consent of H.M.G. To give effect to this suggestion it is proposed that the following alterations should be made in Clause 7; - In lines 3 and 4, substitute for the words 'and shall not include in the areas to be acquired or utilised for the purposes of its operations2 the words 'the surface of'. And before the words 'such harbours' in the twelfth line insert the following 'such sites as aforesaid (which right shall be exclusive) and ' I enclose a re-draft of Clause 7 embodying these alterations. Sub-clsuse 4 of the Pre-emption Clause. Should oil be oroduced it is probable that the oil would be sold to shareholders at a privileged rate, which would be below the free market price. It is therefore suggested tnat after the words 'to other customers' in the fifth line of the second paragraph of this Sub-clause, the words 'other than shareholders' should be inserted. Yours sincerely Enel M.J. Clauson Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.RE-DRAFT OF CLAUSE 7 NOTWITHSTANDING anything contained in the Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh the Company shall not have the right to use or occupy the surface of any sites which may have been selected by or on behalf of the Sheikh or His Majesty's Government for defence purposes, for aerodromes, aeroplane or sea plane bases or for wireless and telegraph installations or in connection with the development of harbours, provided that with the consent of His Majesty's Govern ment which shall not be unreasonably withheld the Company shall have the right to use for the purposes of its operations such sites as aforesaid (which right shall be exclusive) and such harbours as may be developed by the Sheikh or His Majesty's Government if there is not reasonable harbour accommodation available elsewhere.

On (b) he said that I ajor Holmes already has the drafts of the concessions, and discretion as to the financial terms within the total amount which the Coy. are willing to spend on the Trucial Coast.

As it has now been confirmed, I have telephoned to Hr. Lewisohn that the Resident’s criticism of ajor Holmes is that he has been most dilatory - nothing more. Hr.
