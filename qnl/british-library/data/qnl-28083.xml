Apparently the first telegram that the Government of India received was a repetition of a telegram from Sir H.Bullard dated 30th August, in which he said that he and the Soviet Ambassador had seen the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and had presented their terms. This, of course, was altogether wrong and I have asked Mr.Plowman what happened to Foreign Office telegram No.575 dated 27th August which sent to Sir P.Bullard the draft of instructions which were then under discussion with the Soviet Government. 1 found that this was repeated to the Government of India and it v/as sent from here at 3.30 a.m. on 28th August. Unfortunately, however, the Foreign Office, in sending the telegram to our Telegraph Branch for repetition to India, gave no indication on it that it had been marked ’'Immediate' 1 . Accordingly it was given no priority^by the Telegraph Branch and apparently it had not been received by the Government of India at 11.45 last night v/hen they sent their telegram No.2131.S. This question had just been brought to our notice by Mr. Weightman's personal telegram to me of 1st September, in which he said that other F.O. telegrams to Tehran had been greatly delayed because they bore no priority marking. 1 have told Mr. Plowman that, subject to your approval, all telegrams on Persia for the present should be given the marking 'Immediate”. But 1 propose to take the matter up with the Foreign Office and suggest to them that they shouid indicate on all telegrams sent to us for repetition the priority given to the original telegram and that we should give the same priority to our repetition. 1 put up a draft personal telegram to Mr.V/eightman explaining what hashappenedwith suitable apologies.DRAFT TELEGRAM.
