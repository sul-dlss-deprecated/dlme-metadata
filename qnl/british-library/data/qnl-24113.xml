He told me that BAPCO have one bus for the use of Staff employees travelling to and from Manama and 3 buses for Indian employees travelling to and from Manama. In regard to local employees the position is that the Company give them each pay-day (i.e. twice a month) a 'Transportation Chit' on Kanoo. This chit entitles the recipient to one free Journey by a Kanoo bus to and from Manama. , 2. Since the Kanoo buses are an indispensable part of BAPCO'S transportation arrangements the Company will endeavour through the Petroleum Department to obtain tyres and tubes for use in these buses. 14/12/42.Telegram S.

If the cement from India arrives before the shipment from military sources, which Mir. Bowlby had arranged to divert for our use, it would ordinarily be satisfactory to cancel the cement diverted from the military source. Further, because of the uncertainty of the receipt of the Indian cement and the occasional unanticipated long delays that often occur from this source of supply, we would prefer to take delivery of the 500 tons of cement coming through from the military source. We have checked this point with the construction group and we would prefer to have some overage of cement rather than a shortage. Also, we have already borrowed heavily from the K.A.F. and B.O.A.C and are still without cement to continue operations. Yours ver uly, W. P.

Hickinbotham, BeQirein: June 7, 1944» n If 1800 tons of cement of a total of 2500 tons will be discharged for R.A.F. about July 6th, that has not been allocated it is recommended that consideration be given to allocate 1550 tons of this quantity to the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited for their present construction program. Tt Will you please advise as soon as possible concerning such reallocation, so that I may notify the Oil Company.^ Y/e would be very pleased to have you forward the above information to Mr. Van Sickle for his consideration. If sufficient cement cannot be obtained from India to meet the above requirements, it will probably mean delay in com pletion of our construction. We already have suffered one delay because of late shipment of Indian cement. If the Indian cement supply, upon which we have based our schedule, is cut off at this late date, we believe that procurement of cement from any other supply will greatly extend our com pletion date for the project.
