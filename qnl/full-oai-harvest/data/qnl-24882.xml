The report contained translation of an extract from the Pudh Akhbar, dated 3 January 1873, and described a Fakeer, Ameer Ally Sow [Amir Ali Sow], who was living in Bickaneer and giving his family background, how he became a Fakeer and his life and travels over the previous twenty-two years.The report also covered how he earned a living in Bickaneer, recent complaints against him and gave a full physical description.The letter also refers to Eunochs that came from Delhi to Bickaneer following the Indian mutiny but who were dismissed several years previously by the Maharaja.The letter concludes by stating that Burton's enquiries have been carefully but secretly made.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102679.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
