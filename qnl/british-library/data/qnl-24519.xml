The drawing shows the northern tip of the island of Angaum [Jazīreh-ye Hengām], with the following buildings identified and labelled A to G: [telegraph] office, superintendent’s office, clerk’s office, apothecary, storekeeper, store shed, coal shed. Each building has dimensions indicated for its length and breadth, presumably measured in Persian zers (a zer being equivalent to a cubit), which are also indicated on the drawing’s scale.The drawing accompanies copies of correspondence related to the establishment of the British telegraph station at Angaum, dated 1868 (ff 133-135).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100026969900.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
