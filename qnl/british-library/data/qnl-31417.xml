In certain cases these operators 1 have acquired a knowledge and experience of particular local internal routes to be included in the agreed schedule, upon which it may be in the public interest to draw.

In order to make this parallel system effective orei/nco: and economical, arrangements are being made as regards facilities at the cation 0 ‘terminals and along the routes. Provision will also be made for an equitable )n 1 G division of revenue and expenditure where it is agreed that a pooling arrange- i La ment is advantageous.

I would have preferred to defer comment until I had access to my own records, but my personal views, lor what they are worth, are as follows. Vi 2. By the final Act of the Conference it is apparently assumed under Recommendation 1 of Section Viii read wit Article Viii Section 2 ofAppendix 1, that His M 5 J®sry s Government have acquired the right to di sP°se ° f J*® ^ a ^ h ' doms interests in Civil Aviation. I submit that there is no foundation for this view^ 3. I will take the States in detail. First as regards the Trucial Shaikhs- the view is presumably based on the exclusive treaties of the 6th March, 1892. These treaties, however, do not code us any autuority grant concessions to foreigners without reference to the _ rulers, and the Shaikhs would certainly n °t/jjterpret t .eir agreements in this way. The rulers are, of course, well aware of their rights, and it will be recalled that we had the greatest difficulty in securing our own original ®£r h T.i.jbfs for ourselvesJ The Civil Air agreements with oh^rjah and olbai give^us-^ support as they are purely ad hoc arrangements for the benefit of B.O.A.o. ^ 4.

These treaties however are purely ne^tive The Shaikh binds himself not to enter into any •agreement with foreign powers but he do.s give us rtvte blanc to act for him and in the past he has always beer consulted in advance where his interests were affecte . in ArtrHtion the Civil Air Agreement expressly provides thrt we will no? allow foreign aircraft to use Bahrain aerodromes without the Shaikh’s consent, and this completely estops any claim on our part.

As you will see, the note has been written with particular reference to the Chicago Mr Agreements and the recent Petroleum agreement between the TT.TCi and U.S. Governments, with regard to the Chicago Air Agreements the Political Resident is at present considering the beat way of explaining to the Sheikhs that their territories will be regarded as British territory for the purpose of these agreements. ,e presume that it ie still the view of the other Departments concerned here (viz. the Noreign Office, Air Ministry and linietry of divil Aviation) that the Sheikhdoms should be so regarded, but we should be glad to have confirmation of this. e should also be glad to know whether you agree with the terms of the note or whether you have any amendments which you would wish to suggest. 3. 1 am sending a copy of this letter und enclosures to Chilver (Air Ministry), Jones (/of Civil Aviation) and ^tock (Mni&amp;try of Puel and iower) for any comments which they may have to offer.

The standard definition of the these Sheikhdoms is ’’independent ;a*ab States under protection but not British Protectorates*, 2. T he ^hluago --Ir /j-creementf . J-c considering the-'V^ oiiefs fox the U.K. and Indian delegations at Chicago it was thought desirable that the Sheikhdoms should be brought within the terms of the draft U.K. Air Convention in or»*er that traffic between the Sheikhdoms and other U.K„ territories should be reserved to the T.K. as '’cabotage.'' -this was considered to be effected by Section 2 of Article VIIT-of the Interim Agreement as signed, since this Section defined the territory ol a state as including 'territory under protection' and the Sheikhdoms are territories under -British protection. There was no liet or protected territories, etc., attached to the Chicago Agreements. it has since come to light that there are certain inconsistencies between the Chicago Air Agreements aud our livil Aviation Agreements with Bahrain and Koweit, as both the latter agreements provide that H.M.G. shall not grant the use of aerodromes to foreign aircraft without the consent of the Sheikh and that aircraft shall not fly over, or land in, the Sheikh’s territories except under special authorisation issued by the Sheikh. v n the other hand., in the Jhicago -’Two Freedoms' Agreement (International .lir Services Transit Agreement} each signatory state has granted the other contracting states the privilege of flying across the landing for non-traffic purposed in 'its territories' and the definition of 'territory' in Section 2 of .-o-ticle YIII of the Interim Agreement as including 'Territory under protection' is applicable to the Two Freedoms Agreement. Article VII of the I etroleum Agr eement between the U.S. Governments states that the Signatory Governments to 3. U.K. and agree '(a) That the general purpose of •facilitst? the orderly development of petroleum trade and that no provision the exception of Article II, is to be to the operation of the domestic petroleum industry within the country of either Government. tnis ^reement is the international in this Agreement, with construed as applying 1°) That for the purposes of this Article the word 'country' shall mean: (l) in relation to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United i&lt; giorn, those British Colonies, overseas territories protectorates, protected states and/mandated territories administered by that Government. litts of which as at the date of this agreement have been exchanged.' It will be seen xV i. . V T\ j\ that the definition of country \ \ appliedapplied o&amp;ly to ^irticle VII of the Agreement. the liete which were exchanged did not include the Arab Sheikhdoms. The Petroleum Agreement is a general declaration of intention and it would have made no practical difference if they had been so included. J 4. a® regards the Chicago agreements, more difficult. attention is invited to the 27th Septemoer, 1945 recorded by Sir Geoffrey subject (Copy attached « .oinexl) the position is note dated -trior on the On the general question of the international atatus of the Arab Sheikhdoms the position was expounded at some length in Foreign nffice letter Fo. E 647/4/91 of 12rh February, 1935 (copy attached- Annex II) in ' connection with the status of Bahrein for the purposes of the Import Duties Act, 1932. The general conclusion seems to be that, in cases .where H.M.G enter into inter national agreements covering territories under British protection, the Arab Sheikhdoms need not be regarded as automatically included, but that H.M.G. are at liberty to include them if they so wish oy specifically designating them. Before, however, so designating them the agreement of the Rulers is clearly desirable, since without it H.M.G. cannot normally implement the obligations which they may have undertaken internationally. Generally speaking, it is H.ll.G's policy so far as possible to lay emphasis vis-a-vis foreign countries, in the independent position of the Sheikhdoms in order to forestall foreign criticism of our privileged position there, and to counter foreign (in particular Persian) claims to sovereignty over the territory of the Sheikhdoms. i 6. i-n the particular case of the Chicago *iir agreements, the conclusion seems to be that, internationally speaking, we are able to include the bheikhdoras as territories covered by the U.X. signature, but the question of actually so designating them will not arise until the necessity occurs of designating airports v/ithin the Sheikhdoms. On this interpretation if may be comparatively easy for the Political Resident to secure the agreement of the Sheikhs to the application of the Chicago Air Agreements to their territories without their feeling that due consideration has not been paid by H.M.G. to their position. India Office, S.W.l, 14th November 1945. Annex I I have been shown the India office file regarding the position of the Persian Gulf “haikhdoma under the Chicago air Agreement, and understand that X am invited to comment on this subject. I would have preferred to defer comment had access to my own records, but my personal views they are worth, are as follows. until I t f or wha t » By the Final Act of the Conference it is apparently assumed under Recommendation l of Section VIII read with * article VIII Section 2 of Appendix i, that Mia Majesty’s i ! nt acquired the right to dispose of the Sheikhdoms intci ests in ^ivil Aviation. 1 submit that there is no foundation for this view. 3. wixl take the States in detail. First, at regards the Trucial Shaikhs, the viev. i K ^ based on the exclusive treaties of the 6 th Srch 1892 ' ^ A Iheae(^) lot treaties, however, do not cede us any authority to grant concessions to foreigners without reference to the rulers, and the Shaikhs would certainly not interpret their agreements in this way. The rulers are, of course, well aware of their rights, and it will be recalled thst we had the greatest difficulty in securing our own original air rights f o u 7 r eives / 'The Civil ^ir Agreement with Sharjah and Jebai give us no support as they are purely ad hoc agreements for the benefit of EiO.A.C. 4# B ahrai n. Here again our position is presumably bated on the exclusive Treaties of the 2£nd December, 168C, jwever and the 15th harch 1892* These treativs/aie purely negative. The Shaikh binds himself not to enter into any agreement with foreign powers, but he does not give us carte blanc to act for him and in the past he has aiways been consulted in advance where his interests were aifected. In addition Civil Air Agreement expressly provides that we w i“■ 1 not foreign aircraft to use .Bahrain aerodromes without the DhaiKh'e consent, and this completely estops any claim on our part. ^ ^ * &gt;# EuwaijU Here the exclusive treaty of 1899 is less emphatic tiian that of Bahrain and the Shaikh is not precluded from correspondence with foreign powers. His Civil Air Agreement is equally definite and'precludes us from without^t^^v^ ^ rCraft t0 U&amp;e the aer °drome or aerodromes without the ohaiKh s consent. In other words the -haikh expressly retains (and has been allowed by us to retain) the powei to permit foreign airorai t to uas his State. 6, in the been accepted that case of Muscat 1 understand that it has ^ the Sultan is not bound by the Chicago Agreement ana the question of bringing him into the picture is being pursued separately. to Gulf t re Zl ? clvance intimation of our requirements i . 14 0 -‘ ear t0 that their interests e vCiug s^xeguarded, and take care not to offend ti eir su so efti Dili ties, then it is usually ..ossiblP to obtain our r ithout ai i' fi oulty. if this is not done the jJ litioii Officer’s task it rendered immeasurably more difficull and a molehill may easily turn into a mountain. In this case 1 my.eli had not seen a copy of tne agreement until a «eek or 1 E,Ufet be remembered that our oosition in the , eraiar Gull has no otner foundation than the goodwill of the States ana ..u o c easily undermined if this is once lost. i think it is clear that our actions at Ghioa.n cannot be held in any way binding on the ; eie?an Gulf * inyolved Dh U ‘^ e 1 ab , aud “ util the &gt; have accepted the obligations involvede &gt;t,s 1 have temporarily vacated mv r &gt;o + ^ can consider the matter on the spot. fce and ■i_ r ..

(E 647/4/91) My dear Gilbert, With reference to your letter No. P.Z. 583/35 of the 26th January to Hendel, you will remember that I showed you yesterday a minute by lieckett on your draft rep / o the letter from the Board of Customs and Excise about the status of Bahrain, ^ince, however, Beckett sees grave objections to the draft which you sent us, I send you this record of his. views in writing. 2 . In general, Beckett*s position is that, although he fully appreciates the strenght of the political arguments against stating, at an* rate publicly, that Bahrain or any of the other Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf are part of the British Empire for any purpose, he considers that according to international ijw, since His ?; Government control the foreign relations of these u^eikhs (except of course the Sultan of Muscat) these are British protected states over which from the point of view of international law His Majesty possesses sovereignty and therefore we shall have to walk very warily in any official description of the status of the Sheikhdom of Bahrain. The position in international law is however not conclusive for the purposes of the interpretation of an Act of Par liament of the United Kingdom and tr.e following represents the best that he can do in the way of straining the law to meet political exigencies without absolutely misrepres enting it. 3, He suggests that your reply to the Solicitor of the Customs should begin by referring to Section 21 of the Import Duties Act (1932) and pointing out that this is a definition of the British Empire for the purposesof this Act and not for general purposes, arid that tie question at issue is merely whether Bahrain is or is not covered by any of the words of this definition Section. The words by which it could be covered, if it were covered at all. are 'territories under His Majesty’s protection . The letter should then go on to say that the position is that, under treaties concluded with the rulers of Bahrain, the Sheikh of Bahrain has no relations with any Power other than His Majesty*s Government, and His Majesty(s Government deal with foreign Powers over any questions which arise in relation to Bahrain and have also under taken certain obligations to protect the territories of the Bheikh from foreign aggression; tb as regards the internal government of his territory, the oheikh is left fSll independence except that jurisdiction over British c or'-- frvreikners is exercised by llis Majesty, who ls b represented in^ahr^in by a political agent. Though it must be recognised that the expression territories un* der His Majesty*s proteetion' is held to cover territorie such as the Malay States, Sarawak, Brunei and Zanzibar, /where there is...2 &gt;0 ( &lt; 6 where there is a native ruler who enjoys independence in the matter of the internal government of his territories in which His Majesty does not directly exercise jurisdict ion except over foreigners and where from the formal point of view the position is rather similar to that of Bahrain, nevertheless there are grounds for distinguishing Bahrain from these territories.. In the first place, the measure of control exercised in fact by His Majesty*s Government in the other territories mentioned above is greater than in Bahrain, and in the second place there are political difficulties which would be caused by regarding Bahrain as covered by these words in this Act which do not apply in the case of the other territories mentioned. For oolitical reasons it has been deemed expedient in commun ications to foreign Governments to stress the independence of Bahrain and further the ruler of Bahrain would probably take objection to the inclusion of his territories as part of the British Empire, even under a purely statutory definition of the British Empire for a particular purpose, the niceties of which he would never understand. There fore, although from the point of view of strict inter national law it would be correct to regard Bahrain as a tprritorv under His Majesty* s protection, it ooes not necessarily follow that Bahrain should oe regarded as coming under these words in this particular Act of Par liament. The view might be taken that the connection with Bahrain is in practice so loose that it should not be regarded as coming within the intention of Parliament in enacting this Section, and we should therefore suggest that the Customs should act on the view that Bahrain is not covered by the Section. If the ruling of the Customs in this sense were challenged, the question might come before a court, which would them have to decide the matter on the basis of such information as was officially comm unicated to the court on behalf of the Crown* 4, The letter might then go on to sa y that the position is the same in regard to Koweit and the' Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, but that the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman Is in any case in a wholly different position, and, though His Majesty*s Government exercise a particular influence there and protect nationals of the Sultanate in foreign countries, the Sultan is still free to enter into direct, relations with other Pov/ers, and therefore, even from the point of view of strict international law, his territories would not be covered by the expression ’’territories uncer His Majesty*s protection” and a fortiori not covered by this expression in an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom.

In view of considerations mentioned in the Government of India Express Letter quoted in paragraph 4 of your telegram under reference (a) would have to be based on the standard form of agreement for orovisional air routes adopted by the Chicago Conference. Clause giving His Majesty*s Government option of renewal could be added. 3. Even in prewar days (b) included a large number of facilities. List of land plane facilities was communicated to Government of India in Residency letter No.C/619 September 7th 1938 not repeated to India Office. It included the oil depot at fcasirah mentioned in paragraph 4 of your telegram under reference. In addition there were seaplane facilities at Muscat, Khor Jararaa, Masirah and Merbat. To these must be added the facilities mentioned in paragraph 3 of your telegram under 4 . / reference2 4. (a) will have to be paid for under terras to be negotiated. The Sultan has not been difficult in the past regarding grant of facilities to the Koyal Air Force and if we are generous over (a) we may not have to pay for (b). If he does ask for payment I think it should not be difficult to persuade him to accept his quid pro quo in the form of an increase in the total payment for (a). 5. In view of necessity of conforming with the standard form of agreement I think it would be more satisfactory if drafting of (a) and (b) were done in London or India. In order to avoid having to approach the Sultan again and again as in the past for additional facilities communicated piecemeal 9 I would stress the desirability of the drafts covering all our requirements for some years to come. In the case of (b) even if letter does not specify in detail facilities required a complete list will be necessary for discussions with Sultan.

To Sir, The Secretary to the Government of India in the internal affairs Department, -c- ■ 'i. I have the honour to refer to the minutes of the meeting held in the External Affairs Department on Tuesday the 11th December 1^45, to consider the question of civil aviation between India and Persian and to say that I discussed the question of these proposed air routes at a meeting rith Sir Gurunath Bewoor and Sir Frederick Tyraras during my recent visit to Delhi. 2* I pointed out that the proposed route (l) was a roundabout method of reaching Tehran and added that so far as (2) was concerned little payload could be expected along the South Persian coast and that the traffic between Bushire, Shiraz, Isfahan and Tehran would almost certainly be closed to an Indian line as a Persian line is already operating on this section. I added with regard.to the Air Attache’s objections regard ing the mountainous country between Shiraz and Isfahan, that this Persian air line was already covering it with out difficulty, and that 15 years ago Junkers had apparently experienced no difficulty with the primitive aeroplanes then available. As regards (3) and (4), I felt that I could offer no useful suggestions. 3. I then drew attention to an excellent open ing which existed for an Indian air line along the Arab shores of the Persian Gulf. The requisites of a profitable air line are that the distances/should not be too great, and that traffic should readily be available at all the stages. I suggest, therefore, that the Government of India sh mid encourage an air line to fly to Basra stopping at Jlwanl, Sharjah, Bahrain, Kuwait and finally Basra. 4. The present steamer service to Gwadur is very poor and there is little doubt that an air line would attract a considerable amount of air mail, in addition to such passengers as could not wait for a ship. It is true that the distance from Gwadur to Jiwani is consid erable, and at present owing to the indifferent nature of the road takes some 6 hours, but this would not affect air mail and passengers would be prepared to face this. The aerodrome at Jiwani is presumably the property of the Government of India and they could make their own terms /for an .' (^ 5 ) - 2 - for #n «lr line. Uhoild It be possible to utlllsa tha a«rodro;ii 0 at Gwadurf still *aora tramc would, ba avail** a bla y but in any case this distance provides a useful refuelling stop for the more economical ty es of aircraft* 5 # 3harja)i y this air line could land simply by paying:lending fees to His Majesty’s Jovernmnt who already maintain and administer the aerodrome and have an agreement with the Jhalkh of that place. There is a lar;;e Indian con* unity both here and In Dubai who already appreciate air faoilltles 9 and in addition the Indian t’ost Office at Sharjah or Dub/ii would naturally sent their postal oacicets, which can be quite considerable, by an Indian air line, which would be fully Justified since Indian internal air postage rates are now charged. 6. At Bahrain, the air line could land on similar terms and little expenditure would be required* Here again there is a very large Indian comrunity, a close c onnection with iCar M chi and Bombay, an Indian ^ost Office which would make available large quantities of postal air mail packets to and from India, and finally an Arab community fully olive to the advantages of air travel and the disadvantages which they now experience in endeavouring to secure passages on long distance aeroplanes. 7 . At Kuwait the aerodrove is not at present maintained, but it is an all-weather aerodrome (regularly used by Kuwait Oil Company planes up to Lockheed*) which has very seldom gone out of order, and meteorological reports of Basra would with very occasional exceptions suffice for Kuwait. Here a good deal of traffic co &gt;!d be expected since not merely Is there an Indian Post Office which would provide a quantity of air !flail, but there is a growing Indian community based upon the Kuwait Oil Company. 4n air line landing here would be most pooular with the Arabs in that they would not be obliged, as they are at present, to wait a month for a visa to Iraq in order to fly from Basra. , The distance frota Kuwait to Basra is a V'?ry short one but the traffic that Kuwait would provide w ould fully Justify a halt here. £* Basra is the logical terminus of this line and medium-sized aircraft could continue to land in the Basra air port Margil. There can be no doubt that with the close and rapidly increasing trade links that Iraq is forging with India, Basra would provide a considerable number of passengers, and in addition at certain tiies there would be a very large pilgrim traffic which might call for extra planes. * / 9* To sum up, this air line would only be required to fly short distances, through areas with large Indian interests and Indian Post Offices, and with a population well accustomed to air travel,. Potential passengers are at present badly served owing to the fact that the existing air lines cater to lo»£ distance travellers and give thera preference over local traffic. / If theAt / ) -s 3 - If thu jovcmnent of India ar?? contemplating any air llnas outa Ida their terrttorl«tt # I foal that thla Is the ona which la beat adapted to thalr purpose and which will yield the beat revenue with the least outlay of capital, I have the honour to be Sir, Your obedient servant Political ftesldeat, eraian Gulf* HDN.

Right of to contract engagements on behalf of the Arab Shaikhdoms of the Persian Gulf in International Agreements* Note b y iSxt emal Dept» India Office • The question of *8 right to speak on behalf of the Arab ShaikhdoBis of the Persian Gulf (Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Shaikhdoms) in international agree ments he*a recently come to the fore in connection with (l) the Chicago Air Agreements, (2) the recent Petroleum Agreement between the U*K* and U*S* Governments and (3) the Bret ton tfoods Agreements. The standard definition of the status of these Shaikhdoma is !! independent Arab States under British protection but not British Protector ates ** • © h „ 2* fhe Chicago Air Agreements . In considering the briefs i or the U.K. and Indian delegations at Chicago it was thought desirable that the ShaiKhdoms should be brought within the tetos of the draft il.K. Air Convention in order that traffic between the Shaikhdoms and other U.K. territories should be reserved to the U.K. as ”cabotage** • This was considered to be effected by Section 2 of Article VIII of the Interim Agreement as signed, since this Section defined the territory of a State as including w territory under protection** and the Shaikhdoms are territories under British protection. There was no list o£ protected territories, etc., attached to the Chicago Agreements. It has since come to light that there are certain inconsistencies between the Chicago Air Agree ments and o”r Civil Aviation Agreements with Bahrain and Kuwait, as both the latter agreements provide that K.M.G. shall not grant the use of aerodromes to foreign aircraft without the consent of the Shaikh, and that aircraft shall not fly over, or land in, the Shaikh’s territories except under special authorisation issued by the Shaikh. On the other hand, in the Chicago ’’Two Freedoms** Agreement (Inter national Air Services Transit Agreement) each signatory state has granted the other contracting states the privilege of flying across and landing for non-traffic purposes in ’’its territories' and the def inition of 'territory' in Section 2 of Article VIII of the Interim Agreement as in cluding 'Territory under protection' is applicable to the Two Freedoms Agreement. 3. A note on the implications involved was recorded by Sir Geoffrey Prior and will be found below (Annex I). The fact remains that the U.K. signature at Chicago was given to agreements which specifically and in terms applied to all territories under the Sovereignty, suzerainty, protection or mandate of the contracting Governments. The Shaikhdoms are unquestionably under our protection for international purposes and therefore the U.K. signature did cover them. So far as H.M.G. »s own relations with the Shaikhdofcs are concerned, it may not have been correct for H.M.G. to sign agreements covering the Shaikhdoms without consulting them. Nevertheless i t is certain that, internationally, the U.K. is committed in respect of the Shaikhdoms, as territories under H.M.G.»s protection, and it is therefore necessary to find some way of getting the Shaikhs to fulfil the obligations of the Chicago agreements vdaich the U.K. signed. The Political Resident stated in his telegram No.1774 of 2nd December, 1945, that he was proposing to take action to this end. * v e131 - 2 - 4« Article Vii of the letx^oleuTti Agreement between the U.K. arid U#3* Governments states that the signatory Governments agree (a) That the general purpose of this Agreement is to facilitate the orderly development of the international petroleum^ trade and that no provision in this Agreement, with the exception of Article II, is to be construed as applying to the operation of the domestic petroleum industry within the country of either Goverr&amp;iient; (b) That nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as in^airing or modifying any lav or regulation, or the right to enact any lav. or regulation, relating to the iiaportation of petroleum into the country of either Government; (c) That for the purposes of this Article the word 'country* shall mean: (i) k in relation to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, those British Colonies, overseas territories, protectorates, protectea states and all mandated territories a&amp;ainistered by that Government##. lists of \*i ich aB at that date of this Agreement have been exchanged.' It will be soon that the definition of country applied only to Article VII of the Agreement. The lists \niiich were exchanged did not include the Arab Shaikhdoms. The Petrcleua Agreement is a general declaration of intention and it would have made no practical difference ix they had been so included, except that it would then have bean possible to hold, that the oil trade be tv een the Persian Gulf Shaikl&amp;oms and the U.K. or other British territory was domestic trade, and to that extent the activities of the International Petroleum Commission in regard to the international Petroleum trade might have been impaired. 5. as regards the Bret ton Wo ods Agreements , the signatory governments, under Article XX Section 2(g) of the Monetary Fund Agreement and Article XI Section 2(g) of the International Bank Agreement, undertook to accept the Agreements both on their own bdhalf and in respect of all colonies, etc., including all terri t ories under their protection . In point of fact the obligations were not such that theywere likely to be of any practical effect so far as the Shaikhdoms were concerned, and h.M.G. , in the instrument of signature deposited with the U.S.Government, felt entitled to declare that they had taken ’'all steps necessary to carry out all of its obligations under the said Agreement*, in spite of the fact that the Shaikhs had not been consulted by th&gt;in:« 6. The ingpli cat ions involved are m uch the same as in the case oi the Chicago Air Agreements. It has however been considered sufficient in this case simply to inform the Rulers that H.M.G. have accepted certain obligations under the Bretton Woods Agreements which will have effect in their territory. ?• The general conclusion seems to be that if we are going to maintain the position that the Arab Shaikhdoms of the Persian Gulf (excluding Muscat) are British protected states and can have no international relations with other states except through H.M.G. » then we must from time to time under* take international obligations on their behalf, and must see, as a domestic matter between ourselves and the Shaikhdoms, that the latter fulfil those obligations so far as is required./ 33 / 8. ANNEX! I have 136611 shown the India Office file regarding the position of the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms under the Chicago air agreement» and understand that I am invited to comment on this subject* I would have preferred to defer comment until X had access to my own records, hut my personal views, for what they are worth, are as follows. 2. By the Pinal Act of the Conference it is apparently assumed under Recommendation 1 ox oection VIII read with Article VIII Section 2 of Appendix 1, that His Majesty's Government have acquired the right to dispose of the Shaikh doms interests in Civil Aviation. I submit that there is no foundation for this view. 3. I will take the States in detail. Pirst, as regards the Trueial Shaikhs - the view is presumably based on the exclusive treaties of the 6th March 1892. These treaties, however do not cede us any authority to grant concessions to foreigners without reference to the rulers, and tlie Shaikhs would certainly not interpret their agreements in this way. The rulers are # of course, well aware of their rights, and it will be recalled that we had the greatest difficulty in securing our own original air rights for our selves i The Civil Air Agreonents with Sharjah and Dubai give us no support as they are purely ad hoc arrangements for the benefit of B.G.JUC. Bali r a in # Here again our psoition is presu'Oably based on the exclusive Treaties of the 22nd December, 1380, and the 13th March, 1392* These treaties however are purely negative. The Shaikh binds himself not to enter into any agreanent with foreign powers, but he does not give us carte blanche to act for him and in the past he has always been consulted in advance where his interests were affected. In addition the Civil Air Agreement expressly provides that we will not allow foreign aircraft to use Bahrain aerodrome without the Shaikh's consent, and this oompletely estops any claim on our part. 5# Kuwait . Here the exclusive treaty of 1899 is less emphatic than that of Bahrain and the Shaikh is not precluded from correspondence with foreign powers. His Civil Air Agreement is equally definite and precludes us from allowing foreign aircraft to use the aerodrome or aerodromes without the Shaikhs consent. In other words the Shaikh expressly retains (and h&amp;s been allowed by us to retain) the power to permit foreign aircraft to use his State. 6. In the case of Muscat I understand that it has been accepted that the Sultan is not bound by the Chicago Agreement and the question of bringing him into the picture is being pursued separately. 7. Where we give advance intimation of our requirements to Gulf States, make it clear to them that their interests ere being safeguarded, and take care not to offend their susceptibilities, then it is usually possible to obtain our requirements without difficulty. If this is not done the Political Officer's task is rendered immeasurably more difficult and a molehill may easily turn into a mountain. In this case I myself had not seen a copy of the agreement until a week or so ago. It must be remembered that our position in the Persian Gulf has no other foundation than the goodwill of the States and can easily be undermined if this is once lost.3i Meant In* Us* &lt;3oWRM«nt ot India w&gt;uld ba grateful for nay eemfmntd Hie iajaetj^ • Oeeammaet may wtah to auto on the broad etoee exfeeeaed aboee. the lesue of the aboee hae beam authorltod* Sd.

Regional Meeting for the Middle East* 2. The Trucial Sheikhs consist of the rulers of Ajnan, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Kalba, Ras al Khainah, Unm al Qaiv/ain and Sharjah. I suspect however that Bowhill meant to refer also to Bahrein, Kuwait and Qatar. These'arc all British-protected States and their interests should as you say be represented by H.M.G-. Our representative at the Meeting will clearly need guidance as to the interests of those States - perhaps by the attachment to the U.K. delegation of a representative of the Political Resident, if the latter should recomend this course# 3. Muscat and Oman (which is one State) is an independent sovereign State and it would be correct for an invitation to be sent to the Sultan direct, if the fact that Muscat is not a party to the Chicago Agreements makes no difference. The Sultan is however unlikely to be able to send a representative and the State is not in a position itself to provide aerodrome installations, equipment etc., You will remember that in the draft Civil Air Agreement with Muscat, proposed a year ago by the Government of India (see my letter to Jones No, Ext. 2213/45 of 21st June 1945) the Government of India contemplated that they (or H.M.G#) might themselves establish aerodrome installations etc. in Muscat on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat, While therefore it would be appropriate for an invitation to the meeting to be sent to the Sultan direct it seems quite likely that the Sultan will on receipt of this turn to H.M.G. for advice, and if he so asks we think H.M.G. should be prepared to represent his interests at the meeting. 4. A copy of this correspondence is being sent by air mail to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf so that he may be informed of the position. Yours sincerely, fc A. K.

Facilities contemplated for Royal Air Force are so broad in scope as to permit the unlimited use of Muscat aerodromes for all purposes i.e. the permanent stationing of any number of squadrons as Air Ministry may desire. This is scarcely likely to be acceptable to the Sultan especially as no quid pro quo is apparently proposed, and as His Majesty^ Government are not prepared to allow a single aircraft stationed at these aerodromes to be used in the Sultan's interest. n «&gt;/ •r_ Ik ^ ) 3. Previous peace-time facilities for Royal Air Force are given in enclosures to Residency printed letter No.C.620 dated 7th September 1936. These amounted to(a) emergency facilities and (b) facilities for aircraft in transit. Practically speaking, no service personnel have ever been stationed permanently in Sultanate. Consider it therefore (a) essential that Rqyal 4. Air Force requirements be defined more specifically, particularly to cover question of stationing squadrons at aerodromes concerned; and (b) desirable that facilities should be related to peace-time require ments only, with idea of special war facilities, such as that conveyed in last sentence of your telegram, omitted. 5. For your information I predict that Sultan will agree to all facilities required for aircraft in transit but will object to stationing of combatant personnel in his territory, unless we are prepared to offer substantial quid pro quo as was considered in the case of Masirah island. -POLITICAL0 (R) Telegram En clair From Political Resident, Bahrain.

Enclosed for your information is a copy of letter No.C/4&gt; dated the 27th November, 1946, which I received from His Highness on this subject. I am forwarding it as it indicates the unfortunate impression which can be created in His Highness* mind if he is given little time to consider such important matters. I have little doubt that, when writing this letter, His Highness was thinking of his complaint of the short time given to him to consider the Oil Concession Agreements before he signed them in 1938. 3- In the discussion referred to in my telegram referred to above, I opened by referring to His Highness* letter and I assured him that everything possible had been done to place the matter before him at the earliest opportunity and that the delay in doing so should not in any way be taken as meaning that we wished to hurry him in so important a matter. I then brought to his notice that my country had just emerged victorious from the most destructive war in history and that the after-math of such a war inevitably produced a large number ofirery complex problems both national and international. I went on to inform him that it was unreasonable, in my view, to expect that such issues could be decided on our side with the same ease and expedition as had been possible before the war. I also took the opportunity of drav/ing his attention to the very great services which His Majesty’s Government had rendered to Muscat during the war. 4. In reply His Highness stated that he fully understood the position; that he was indeed appreciative of all the help and assistance given to him by His Majesty’s Government especially during (Signature) s. 44.

Political Agent, Muscat Political Resident, Pahrain No.C 522 Dated the 2C)th Novemher, 1946, Correspondence resting with your telegram No.1371 dated 27th November. Ail? Facilities. I had long preliminary discussion with Sultan on 23th which mainly concerned basic principles of draft agreement I am not reporting results in detail but have left record of my discussion for my successor. 2. First important reactions of Sultan are briefly (a) R.A F. facilities These he was prepared to grant as requested though he considered that regulations governing conduct of R.a.F. personnel at all aerodromes occupied by them might be necessary. He would expect that / American stone buildings at Masirah and Salalah and pump at Salalah would be made over to him or rent paid for their use. (b) Pis exceptions to the draft Civil Air Agree ment concerned articles 4,5, and 15. Article 4 he required to be re-drafted to make it clear that foreign Air lines would only be authorised to use air facilities in Muscat territory on regular commercial basis by himself. Article 5 he asked to be deleted. Article 15 paragraphs 1 and 2 be also suggested should be deleted. ne askeo for clarification of expression ’’Commercial entry” in Article 4* 3 # ( a ) Sultan insisted that authorisations for all commercial aircraft should be issued by Pis jovernment to whom fees for their issue would accrue( Article 6 of Air Con vention refers). (b) Regarding payments for facilities granted Sultan wished these to be treated separately for (a) Gwadur ) Oman including Masirah and Dhofar/// Payments were not discussed beyond this but impression gained was that satisfactory '’quid pro quo” for Civil racilites would lead him to drop any idea he may have of payments for Royal Air Force facilities apart from those mentioned in paragraph 2 (a) above. He stated that Royal Air Force had always been his friend concerning whose facilities he was sure there would be no difficulty. (c) Sultan wished period of agree^nt to be for 3 years only but* approved suggestion of exchange of letters for renewal of agreement for further.3. years subject to readjust ment for payments in the light of density of air traffic after expiry of first 3 year period. Politi calOn the 28th, I discussed In general terns the proposed Muscat Civil Air Agreement with His Highness the Sultan. I informed him that as I would shortly making over charge to my successor I thought that the best procedure would he for the discussion to ^ principles of the agreement and that I would leave record of these discussions which could then be continued by you. .be first point raised by His Highness was the meaning of ^Commercial entry'* in Article IV of the draft. I said that elucidation of this expression would be asked for (please see Residency telegram No.1371 dated the 27th November. 1946). The second point was that His Highness has no objection in particular to paragraph 2 of the Draft Agreement. His Highness did however object to Article IV of the Draft Agreement. In regard to this he stated that he would have no objection to our granting rights of transit, and non- 9 d 1Y traffic stop to cmr craft. I had previously pointed out to him that under the International Air Transport Agreement . * or 'The Two Freedoms' Agreement' to which we were^signatory-A we could not avoid granting rights of transit and non-traffic stops of foreign lines if we were appointed as his Agents. His Highness wished to make it clear that the granting of permission to use Air Facilities in Muscat to foreign air lines for commercial purposes is a matter which he wished to retain in his own hands. As a corollary of above paragraph, His Highness asked that paragraph 5 of Draft Agreement should be deleted. This request seems to me to be reasonable though an amendment to insist on correspondence on transactions with foreign companies' flights being conducted through us on purely technical matters might be acceptable. The next which His Highness raised was that he wished to insist on authorisations for aircraft using in, or facilities^ available in Muscat, being authorised to do so'by himself or his Government and that fees for such transactions would be retained by the Muscat Government. This view would appear to be reasonable.- 2 - His Highness took objection to Article XV para 1 of the Draft Agreement. He asked for its deletion. I do not consider this request unreasonable. He suggested that Article XV para 2 might be deleted also as it was redundant. I agree with this view. So far as the last para of Article XV is concerned, he stated that he would prefer this paragraph to be re-drafted 'so that Customs duty would be paid on all spares imported by B.O.A.C. into Muscat territory and subsequently refunded by him on re-export. He % insisted that this arrangement would be for B.O.A.C. only or for any other British Air Lines which might be in existence at the moment, and be included in the agreement. He ma im.lii'igwl le agiuu to Customs Duty^fee4**g refunded on spare parts issued Vy the Agents acting on his behalf to foreign air lines. His Highness himself raised the method of payments which he would prefer. He stated that he would like these to cover three areas in his territory: firstly Gwadur, secondly Oman including ?iasirah and thirdly Dhofar. In case of Gwadur, I pointed out that at present only emergency landings would be required and that the question of quid-pro-quo would hardly arise. His Highness agreed but that should in future Gwadur is required as a permanent landing area, he would expect payments for this. So far as the period of the Agreement was concerned, His Highness said that he would like this to be only for three years in the first instance as after that period re-examination of the fees payable might well be necessary if air transport had begun to use his territories on greatly increased scale. He said that in exchange of letters he would agree to extend the Civil Air Agreement for a further period of three years provided satisfactory understandings regarding payment had been arrived at. So far as R.A.F. requirements were concerned, His Highneds seemed quite prepared to grant these facilities hut mentioned the probability of certain rules and regulations being requiredconcerning the conduct personnel in his territories. fty impression was that he would agree to granting R.A.F. facilities without ciuid £ro auo provided payments for Civil Aviation facilities were to his satisfaction.Telegram Cypher O.T.P.

I suggested, and they agreed, that the Sultan should be asked by an exchange of letters appended to the proposed Civil Air Agreement to permit the stationing of a limited number of R.A.F, personnel at Salalah and Masirah for staging purposes whenever required. It should also be mentioned in the letters that if the R.A.F. wish at any time in the future to station personnel in excess of the stated number or aircraft on these islands application will be made to the Sultan accordingly. I suggested - and I understand that this is also the view* of the India Office - that the subsidy of £.5,000 per annum which is proposed in the draft Civil Air Agreement should be sufficient to cover the facilities for the R.A.F. for which it is now prpposed to ask. If extended facilities are required at any time in the future it may be necessary to increase the subsidy. I pointed out the necessity of reaching an early decision as the Sultan is due to leave Muscat about December 15th and an agreement must be reached with him before that date as present arrangements expire on December 31st. Air Commodore Brook promised that the Air Ministry^ proposals would be transmitted to the India Offifie at a every early date. It was agreed that it was unnecessary to discuss facilities for the R.A.F. at Sharjah on the assumption that the present Air Agreement will be slightly amended and continue in force until 1940 (?1948) May I kindly be given a topy of this note.

This point is discussed in Civil Aviation Ministry’s letter No. R.5806/45, of October 10th. I will call Sultan's attention to position regarding 1939 Fuel Convention, but I am doubtful if we shall be on good ground in insisting on anything which is not provided for in Article 24 of Chicago Convention. 9• Paragraph 2(c). We should try to persuade Sultan to recognise civil air agreement as being authori sation for British Overseas Airways Corporation and all other British Empire air lines including Indian lines for so long as India remains within Empire. 10. Paragraph 3. I do not understand why Sultan wishes separate payments for different regions and will discuss point further with him. 11. Paragraph 4. Period of agreement. This is a matter for bargaining. It may be possible to compromise on five years. 12V Sultan is leaving Muscat for Dhofar on December 16th and in view of numerous points requiring discussion]there is little or no hope of reaching final agreement before his departure. I therefore propose subject to concurrence of His Majesty’s Government to endeavour to persuade Sultan to agree to continuance of existing facilities for British Overseas Airways Corporation and Royal Air Force on cheapest possible basis making3 provision for use of aerodromes by other British (including Indian ) aircraft with previous permission of Sultan. i I • I expect be in Muscat on December 6th and again on December 10th and 11th.

It imicedietely became clear that (a) His Highness not only wanted the payment to be separate for each In~ivisual areasj but also wanted three separate and distinctive agreement covering each individual area: &amp;(b) with regard to Article 4 and 5 His Highness not only wanted to retain in his own hands the authority to grant rights of commercial entry to foreign planes but also to British planes. As regards (a) His Highness gave his reason for wishing to have three separate agreements the fact that he wished to impose separate conditions for each aerodrome. I suggested that it was a confusion to have three agreements and that his point regarding the conditions for the use of the individual aerodrome could be covered by specification in the schedule referred to in Article 6 of the agreement. His Highness finally agreed that provided this was done and note made in Article 17 specifying individual rentals for the use of each aerodrome ^ he would agree to one over all agreements being drawn up. -n.s regards Article 18. after discussion His Highness said that he would agree to the agreement being for 7 years provided a clause was inserted to the effect that payments negotiated in Article 17 could be subject to revision after three years in the light of the density of traffic. Regarding Articles 4 and 5, His Highness was most c authorisations of ^ . emphatic that any/flights over his territory should remain in his hands. I find on reference to the early in his hands. authorisations ofcorrespondence that all that was asked at least by the Government of India was that to ensure if possible that the Sultan should consult the representatives of th'e Government of India and His Majesty* 3 Government for making arrangements with other countries giving them rights to operate or use provided by His Majesty’s Government, vide No. F. 111/3/^/45, dated the 25th April, 1945 from the Government of India, * ' ^ ^ 0.3 iw now stands, was Inserted In spite Oi. ain anc: Iliiwait, Musc't’s position in this respect being admitted to be entirely different. It seems to me therefore that there is nc real necessity for us to insist on inclusion of Article 4 in this agreement or to insist on authorisation for commercial flights being granted by His Majesty’s Government. Though this is my view, in discussion with His Highness, I merely said that one valic reason at least for the inclusion of some such article was that His Majesty’s Government had undertaken to mainti in the previous facilities at the aerodromes It was obvious that aerodromes had limited capacity, whether this be 10 , £0 or 30 aeroplanes, and that unless the same party who maintained the aeroplanes also have some control ever the number of planes using the aerodrome, there may be a danger of overlapping. His Highness saw this and said that he would give verbal assurances not to grant any authorisation to use the aerodromes without reference to the appropriate authorities of His Majesty’s Government. I enquired whether he would not give a written letter to this effect. He seemed reluctant to this, therefore I did not press the point but merely contented myself by saying that there will be why His Majesty’s Government had asked other reasons3- (g) for the inclusion of this article and that after reference to higher authorities, I would take up the question again I am inclined to consider that if we get a written assurance that His Highness will not gr^nt without reference to His Majesty's Government, this would meet kk our requirements. Regarding authorisations for British planes, His Highness stressed that he would only authorise B.O.A.C. planes,and that he wished to grant separate authorisations to each individual plane. In this respect, I noticed that although the whole tenor of the agreement and air navigation regulation is to the effect that British planes will be permitted to use the aerodromes, the agreement is actually an agreement only to maintain the aerodromes and in no place it is specifically mentioned that we can use as well as maintain the aerodrome.. We talked round on this subject for a considerable time. Finally I formed the opinion that His « Highness would be prepared to grant at the beginning of each year a general authorisation for any plane specified by the B.O A.C., who may wish to use the aerodromes and that if occasionally planes not so specified use the aerodrome, His Highness would not object. His Highness however has certainly at the back of his mind the question of fees chargeable as for such authorisation which he would consider/separate from any sums negotiated under Article 17 of theEaP rJEa. l P From Secretary of stcte for India. • T° Politic^1 Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Dear Harrison, In his letter of the 5th September Jones explained to you the difxiculty that had suddenly confronted us in the matter of the T luscat Civil Air Agree 1 .lent, owing to the unexpected change of mind on the part oi B*0 # A#C« in respect of the commercial prospects of the Hadramaut route. ' e have given the matter careful consideration and the following appear to be the relevant factors (i) The H.A*F* have a strategic recuirement for this route; (ii) The Sultan, as experience has shown, is prepared to give facilities to the R.a.f. under the cover of a Civil Aviation facade, but it is by no means sure that he will be prepared to agree to the establishment of military bases in his territory. (iii) lf he will not agree to this, and no civil arrangement is made, there will be a dangerous vacuum, and some other power may offer to unuertrke the provision of facilities for Civil Aviation, as is shown by the correspondence of which you sent us copies with your No.Ext.6286 of 14th September, 1046, T.W.A. are already making approaches to the Sultan. (iv) B.O.A.Cts hesitancy is perhaps due to the calculation that in the immediate future the only means of providing e South Arabian service is by an extension of the U.K. - west Africa Tudor II service, since otherwise the aircraft would have no base. An operation by Tudor IIs along the Hadramaut route might certainly prove unprofitable, but we have other plans for the area and are at the moment considering setting up a local airline based on Aden which would serve the Aden Protectorate and British Somaliland, and also operate to Addis Ababa and Jedda and ultimately perhaps to Cairo and Nairobi and Karachi. In view of* the strong commercial ties between Aden and India such a line would almost certainly wish to operate a service along the Hadramaut Coast to Karachi. In short, whether immediately or in the future, we have a requirement for civil^facilities along this route, and it would be a short-sighted policy to allow the opportunity of securing them to lapse. We have accordingly reached the conclusion that the only proper course is to go ahead with the proposals for a Civil Aviation Agreement with the Sultan. As regards points of detail we have the following comments to make on the draft tonn ox Agreement which you prepared.grants exeruptiou in respsct of fuel and oil taken on ooard on aircraft for flignts abroad , in the case of v use at however, fuel may be taken on for flights beti'-een Masirah and Jjalalah both of which are within tne Sultan’s territory, and the difficulty of deter mining in practice what is intended for flights within uho territory, c;nd what for flights abroad, would introduce insuperable complications, (^) Schedule I, Landing fees. It is suggested that the revised scale of charges for hal'd runways in the U.K. as shown in the last colunn of Notice to Airmen No,98/46 (copy attached) should be substituted. It is possible that the scale may have again to be altered as a result of P.l.C.A.O, agreements, but provision for amendment existing in /rticle 9 of the Agreement. The scale of housing fees may remain for the present as it is. We should like in this connectio: to be clear that the power to amend the schedule effectively rests in His Majesty’s Government and that the Sultan’s consent is not required. The draft may be \\ ambiguous on this point. If you are satisfied that it gives us what we want let us Icnve it. But we should be grateful for y'Ur confirmation that it does. (6) Schedule II. /1 tend ..nee Fees. This should be omitted altogether. These fees date from an era when airfields were not permanently manned and the arrival of an aircraft necessitated the ad hoc assembly of the staff. Uhder modern conditions the landing fee is intended to cover the cost of the ordinary services. The omission of this schedule will involve a slight amendment to Article 13# I am sending copies of this letter to Varran at the Air -inistry and Nasmyth at the Treasury, Yours sincerely, (bClD, ; , , . .From To Repeated Copy by Political Resiaent, at Muscat.

ImPui.l, HT y telegram : iT o.T/6lO Decei.,ber 6th MUSCc t Civil Air Agreement. The following further points are for considera tion as a result of discussions with Sultan end further examination of draft here. Article Sultan wants assurance that he will not be called upon to bear expense in connection with quarantine arr ngements apart from allowance he a Ire: ay pays to q.m.Q. Muscat. Presumably I can give him this. 4. Article 6 . Sultan wishes to retain power i to issue authorisations for commercial aircraft only on payment of fee. His object is to increase his revenues and he informed me that Egyptian Government charge £62 per aircraft per annum for authorisations. The article r i q was presumably modifieu and rule 1 of part II of the agreement omitted on basis of Prior’s telegr. ms 17*4 and 1715 of December Lnd 194b, which do not apply to Muscat. Subject to pre-ctice elsewhere regarding which I have no information suggest Sultan be permitted to issue authorisations on payment of reasonable fee say • b per aircraft per annum. He might be persuaded to exempt B.O.A.C. in return for subsidy but this would perhcps be objectionable on grounds of discrimin: tion.*“ «• /rticle ,), Sultan will agree to article permitting correspondence on technical m*tters concern ing the management of the aerodromes being conducted through the relevant British authorities. Article 6, The reference to 'the Schedule” appears to me to be wrong. The conditions are contained in Part III of the draft. ^• Article 7, The Sultan wishes an addition made to the effect that if it is found necessary to establish a wireless st, tion outside the limits of an o.eroarome his prior approval shall be obtained to site. I can see no objection to this. B. Article la, Para 1. Sultan will not willingly agree to refund of Customs duty on oil and iuel. Re argues that as Muscat is a poor country he should be allowed to retain this duty. He might be persuaded to grant concession to B,0,A.C. only but this would probably be objectionable on grounds of discri.ina- tion c.f. the first enclosure to India Office express letter No.Ext.6970/46 October Elst, I recommend that the Sultan*s point be conceded. 7 9. Article 16, Is this article required ? The Suit/n will probably put up his price if we include Shines in the agreement c.f. para 10 below. 10. Article 17# The sultan is anxious to charge a separate rental for e; ch aerodrome, I have suggested a lump sum and mentioned a figure less than the maximum I am authorised to offer. The Sultan has promised to consider my suggested, figui'e and let me he.ve his reply when I return to Muscat on Pec ember loth. He will I feel sure wish us to have in the Agreement or in a schedule attached to it the aerodromes where we re uire facilities with the idea of demanding autitional subsidy if we wish to increase their number.I 1 . Article 10. T he Sultan will now agree -even year period provided ;n addition is made to the article allowing for a re-consideration of the -.'iibsidy oitcr the first three years. His intention is to ask for an Increased subsidy then if there is a substantial increase of traffic using the aerodromes. li. Part II. Apart from the possible restora tion in a modified form of rule 1 c.f. para 4 above tl. is Part Can probably stand with a few minor alterations which I will suggest later. Part HI, This requires recasting to cover general conditions and special conditions which the Sultan wishes observed at different aerodromes* He wishes elaborate rules framed to cover the behc viour movements etc* ol h*a«r. and personnel but will be satisfied for the purposes of the Agreement if a clause is included in Part ill making provision for the framing of these rules by himself and the Political Resident in consultation, 14.

Letter No.C.806-2/40, dfstori the 10th December, 1946, from the Political MUSCAT CIVIL AIR AGREEMENT Agent, Muscat, to the Suitan of ?«usc&amp;b and Oman.On the 10th when I visited His Highness I took copies of the drafi Air Agreement and Schedules which we drew up on board 'King Faisal'. We discussed them generally but not in detail as His Highness wanted time to study. On the 11th, we discussed in detail. His Highness' observations are roughly as follows: Article 2 of the Air Agreement, His Highness again pressed for an assurance that the Quarantine Medical Officer will be provided and paid by us. I said i-fcave referred ■ MkC,, a%r»it this to ygx* and would let him know the reply in due course. Article 4, His Highness wished this to be re-drafted to read as follows 'His Majesty's Government is authorised to grant on behalf of the Sultan the use of aerodromes for transit non stop and stops for non traffic purposes to Foreign aircraft.' Article 5, His Highness said that he did not want to bother in correspondence on technical matters and suggested A that the last sentence should be altered to read 'shall be addressed to' instead of 'shall be conducted through'. Article 15, His Highness did not like tiis. He wi shed this to he altered so that it would he more in Keeping with Article 24 (b) of the convention. His. object being I think that only spares required for an air service should be exempted from Customs Duty (i.e) not spares :or charter of private planes. His Highness had no more comments on the agreement except concerning the annual rental to be negotiated for which he suggested a sum amounting to double the sum mentioned by F.R. &lt; Regarding Schedule IT Air navigation Regulations, His Highness said that this mainly concerned technical matters and he would like more time to study it and in themeen time had the following remarks. Article 4, words 'His Highness' should be omitted. Art. ole 5, His Highness wished the word 'lawfully' to be omitted as he considered it redundant. We discussed this for some minutes and I considered it that KiS highness would ^ g ive &amp; nd JT did not think it worthwhile to press the matter too far at this stage. Article 14 (Hi) the words rt he shall be dealt with according to law'. His Highness was very emphatic in requesting the list of penalties should be drawn up and provision made for the application under the Order in Council. I think that we should be able to do this without too much difficulty under Article 16 (1) of tie Order in Council. Schedule III General conditions laid down by the Sultan. Article 1, His Highness wished the words 'as agents of the Sultan'to be inserted after words 'His Majesty’s Government' appearing in the second line. I see no olbjection to this. In the last line, His Highness wished the words 'through the neglect of' to he altered to read a* 'by'. I argued this for some time but His Highness was insisting# ' * article 4, His Highness wished this to be altered to read 'iiny special rules for the conduct and security of personnel stationed at, and passengers and personnel of aircraft yyrai passing through the aerodromes shall be complied with? His Highness’object was to a void a reference^ fco-any document which would be published.to His /ajesty’s Government as joint authors oj? rules which he maintained WCW 1 * purely his own concern. Ke said however that he had frsr no objection to an exchange of confidential letters ix which he would agree to frame the rules in consultation with thearticle 5, His Highness wished the words 'the Sultan , 'i»e Wormed' to be amended^o read 'the Sultan's pri. approval H . I see no objection to this. i or Special Rules. His Highness wished the heading to al + i:red 30 to omit the words 'His Britannic Majesty’s . ■ .epresentative in the Persian Gulf”. Article 11, His Highness wished the words ’’within the limits of the aerodrome”to be altered to read ’’within the aerodrome camp”. Article 12, H*3 Highness wished the words 'valid Muscat” to be inserted betw T eeh the words ’’shall possess a” and 'driving licence' in the last sentence. I see no objection to this. Article 14, His Highness again wished the words 'limits of the aerodromes' to be altered to read 'aerodrome camp”. His Highness further suggested insertion of a note to read 'Articles 4, 10 and 11 apply o&amp;Jv to Masirah”. A J* The draft letter regarding R.ii.F. requirements Para Is His Highness said that he had no comments. Para 2 (2): His Highness asked for a more precise definition of essential equipment by the insertion of the words (i.e.) rifles, revolvers, side arras and ammunition if for same. after Para 2 (4); /the words 'stone buildings',His Highness suggested to insert the words 'actually used'. His Highness also wished ground rent to be paid xor the existing buildings.

He showed an American statement of total capital cost for buildings at Masirah and Salalah which amounted to $ 1,000,000. He ad mitted this excessive but indicated he intended asking for rent of any buildings required based on 1/3 of American capital cost. POLITICAL.‘ A l n INDIA OFFICE.

As explained in my express letter under reference H.M.G. had it in mind that R,i ,F. requirements in Muscat would best be covered by an exchange of letters appended to this agreement. H.M.G. would be prepared to pay up to £ 5,000 a year for their overall requirements of both civil aviation and R*A*F. facilities and within this limit they would leave it to you to negotiate most favourable terms possible, and if £ 5,000 proved insufficient would require that you should refer to me again# They contemplated that period of agreement should be for seven years in first instance, renewable at option of H.M.G. with concurrence of Sultan. 3, I note however from your Express Letter No,829-S of 1st October that you consider that Sultan may not be willing to agree to grant oi facilities for the unlimited use by R.A#F. of aerodromes on Muscat territory, and in particular to the permanent stationing of R.A.i''# personnel there, without some substantial quid pro quo, and that you consider it essential that R.A.F. requirements should be defined more specifically. The latter point is being taken up with the Air Ministry, and a further communication will be sent to you in due course, 4. Meanwhile I should be glad if you would consider the proposals contained in this letter and let me have any comments. You will no doubt consider it undesirable to initiate any discussions with the Sultan until you receive the further communication promised in paragraph 3 above.

As is sho-./n by the correspondence 01 ymch you sent us copies with your N 0 . EXT.6286 of 14th September, 1946, T.7.A. are already making approaches to the Sultan. ^. 0 .a.C, ’ s nesitancy is perhaps duo to thc calculation that in thc immediate future the only means of providing a South Arabian service is by an extension of tho U.K. - ./cst fifrica Tudor II service, since otherwise thc aircraft would have no base, Jm operation by Tudor Us along the Hadramaut route might certainly prove unprofitable, but we have other plans for tho area and arc at the moment considering setting up a local airline based on Aden which would serve the Aden Protectorate and British Somaliland, and also operate to Addis Ababa and Jedda and ultimately perhaps to Cairo and Nairobi and Karachi. In view of thc strong commercial ties between Aden and India such a lino would almost certainly wish to operate a service along the Hadramaut Coast to Karachi, In short, whether immediately or in tho future, we have a requirement for civil facilities along this route, and it would be a short-sighted policy to allow the opportunity of securing them to lapse, Ac have accordingly reached thc conclusion that the only proper course is to go ahead with the proposals for a Civil Aviation Agreement with the Sultan. As regards points of detail wo have the following comments to make on the- draft form of Agreement which you prepared, (l) Article 15* Tc suggest that tho first paragraph should run as follows:- (iv) V n 15. Whilst all oil and petrol for the use of all aircraft, other than Royal Air Force requirements, '.ill be subject to thc importation duties at thc time existing, His Highnessaprecs to refund quarterly the duties collected on all oil and fuel that may have been actually issued to an aircraft for u°'G in flight a such amounts bcinq ccitiiied by the Sntlr ^onts a^ointoc as suppliers etc. etc' It mip-ht be possible to contend that b.O.A.C. should enjoy the privilege of remission of the duty on fuel and oix in return for the subsidy that the U.K. will pay the Sul tan j and that this does not amount to discriminations but the argument would be rati nr tnin, and \/c are of opinion that all international operators ’aill have to be put on the same footing. There is no universally accepted principle in regard to duties on fuel and oil, but the unratified 1939 Fuel Convention which is observed by many countries as a matter of courtesy grants exemption in respect of fuel and oil taken on board on aircraft for f lig hts abroad . In the case of Hus cat, however, fuel may be taken on for flights between Hasirah and Salaleh both of which ere within the bultan’s territory, and the difficulty of determining in practice what is intended for flights within the territory, and what for flights abroad, would introduce insuperable complications. (2) Schedule I. Landing Fees. It is suggested that the revised scale of charges for hard runways in the U.K. as shown in the last column of Notice to Airmen No, 93/46 (copy attached) should be substituted. It is possible that the scale may have again to be altered as a result of P.I.C.A.O. agreements, but provision for amendment existing in Article 9 of the .Agreement, The scale of housing fees may remain for the present as it is. We should like in this connection to be clear that the power to amend the schedule effectively rests in His Majesty 1 s Government and that the bultan 1 s consent is not required. The draft may be ambiguous on this point. If you are satisfied that it gives us what we want let us leave it. But we should be grateful for your confirmation that it does. (3) Schedule II. Attendance Fees. This should be omitted altogether. These fees date from an era when airfields were not permanently manned and the arrival of an aircraft necessitated the ad hoc assembly of the staff. Under modern conditions the landing fee is intended to cover the cost of the ordinary services. The omission of this schedule mil involve a slight amendment to Article 9.

After discussion Sultan has reduced his list of additions and amendments to following^ which I consider reason able. 3* Reference Schedule II Air Navigation Regulations after paragraph 1 insert paragraph 1(a) as follow*: 'The application for the grant of authorisation to an aircraft of a scheduled International Air service to fly over or within the Sultan*s terri tories and territorial waters shall be made by the registered owner of the aircraft or his proxy, and shall clearly state the class of authorisation required**. 4. After paragraph 13 insert 13(a) as follows: **Any laws and regulations not covered by the above paragraph but which are generally adopted by the International Air Navigation MwwAgotien Organisation shall also apply'. This is drqwn up more or less in accordance with Article 37 J of the Convention and is to replace a long list of / special customs regulations which the Sultan wished to specify in an additional schedule. Sultan wishes paragraphs 14&gt; 18 to 25 and 28 of the Draft Egyptian Air Navigation Regulations (Section I) suitably amended and altered to meet Muscat's requirements to be in- eluded somewhere in Schedule. Am sending copy of relevant paragraphs of Egyptian Regulations, which seems harmless, by mail together with copy of Sultan*s list of amendments as it stood before this morning's discussion. 7Sultan has been working out with his State engineer rents to be charged for buildings in Salalah and Masirah to on basis price paid by B.O*A*C* for Beach camps Salalah* They have arrived at total figure of 3,200/- pounds sterling Xl7 (g) [| repeat 3,200/- for all existing buildings. I have told him that this is far too high and I think he agrees but first mentioned this figure and his method of calculation to show me that we are expecting far too much when we asked for agreement plus rents all for 5,000/- pounds sterling. I have told him that the rent question is one which will have to be examined after I get to Salalah and after I have received fresh instructions from you. Sultan also said if we did not want the buildings he would like to dismantle them and use the materials for constructional works elsewhere. I mention this to indicate that he intends to stick out for stiff price for rents. P0LITCALTelegram From To Repeated Cypher India Office, London. Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

I presume that the India Office will be for warding to you the finally approved drafts by Air Mail some time towards the end of January, and as I should like to have an opportunity of discussing then wit}' you, before proceeding to Dhofar, I sruggont that, if you see no object ion, I should visit Bahrain in the second ’ralf of January travelling overland to Sharjah, ( this would give me an opportunity of touring the Ratinah, which I must in any case do shortly ) thence to Bahrain by air. If B.O.A.C arc no longer operating thds route, perhaps the Royal Air Force could fly me. From Bahrain I could fly to Phofar by P.Q.A.C* via Karachi, returning the same nay to report to you when the agreement is sirred. 3. I believe that it is necessary for all paaeengers from Salalah to Indie to be in possession of a Yellow fever inoculation certificate.

Dear Colonel Hay Please refer to your telegram No.16, dated the 6th January, 1947. 2. Under Article 2 of the Air Agreement, the sole di scretlon as to the appointment of agents to manage the aerodromes is vested in His Majesty's Government. I think it can be assumed that the authority appointing a Manager is that Manager's Director, and in consequence the term 'Director' wherever used, should mean His Majesty's Government. I suggest that we get the Sultan's verbal agreement to this interpretation, or, alternatively, to make the position quite clear, we should propose that the word 'Director' wherever it appears should be altered to read as 'Sultan's Agent'. On the same basis, I suggest that the word 'licensee' appearing in Article 28 should be altered to read as 'management'. 3. If these amendments are accepted, I suggest that the best way of incorporating these new regulations in the present draft would be to add a new paragraph 16 to Schedule 2 of Air Navigation Regulations to read as follows: '16. The Manager of any aerodrome, approved under Article 4 above, as a place of landing, or departure, shall be responsible for: (i) The control of air traffic on and in the vicinity of the aerodrome and the observance of the air navigation regulations that apply to the aerodrome, its equipment and management. (ii) Departure of aircraft shall be subject to the authorisation of the aerodrome Manager and the pilots of all incoming aircraft shall report to him on arrival. (iii) Breaches of the Air Navigation Regulations coming to his notice shall be reported to the Director (or, the Sultan Agent). (iv) Statistical information concerning the movements of aircraft, passengers and loads carried shall be supplied to the aerodrome Manager by aircraft operators, on demand. (v) The area reserved on an aerodrome for the operation of aircraft must be kept free of unauthorised persons, vehicles and animals not under proper control. (vi) No buildings or other obstructions shall be erected on an aerodrome without the authority of the Director (or, the Sultan’s Agent). (yH) Adequate precautions shall be taken for the pro tection of aircraft, hangars,buildings, installations and the aerodrome itself from fire. (viii) The Hon'ble Lt. Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf,(xi) Adequate first-aid equipment shall be provided a airports and at aerodromes where there is a resident 17. Any authorised person shall have the ri^ht of access at all reasonable times to ar^y aerodrome for the pur pose of inspecting the same, or to any place to which access is necessary for the purpose of carrying out his powers and duties under these regulations. 13. In the case of any contravention of or failure -to comply with the regulations relating to aerodromes, the management of the aerodrome shall be deemed to have acted in contravention of or, as the case may be, failed to comply with these regulations.” Yours sincerely, 0fh ;.&lt;• CONFIDENTIAL D.0.

I agree to your proposals in principle but it is difficult to arrange details until we know when final orders from His Majesty's Government about the Air Agreement are likely to be received. We can arrange for your yellow fever inoculation in Bahrain. 3. I expect to visit the Trucial Coast in the 'Nearchus' leaving here January 19th or 20th and returning about the 27th or 28th. You might in any case plan to reach Sharjah about the 24th or 25th. I could then bring you to Bahrain in the 'Nearchus' though I am afraid you would have to sleep on the. deck as the Galloways and Mary will probably be with me. It would, I hope, only be for one night. 4.
