Whatever may follow, will be of your own causing, I have done all I could to prevent ill happening to any one, and have been as always Your's most sincerely, (Signed) W. L. MEREWETHER. I must request you to make some better arrangement in your present office and with existing establishment. In the latter respect, you are not worse off* than others. My office is very under-handed and already overworked with current business, so that they cannot possibly copy long papers of another office in addition to their own labor. Kurrachee, 7th September 1870, M y D ear P a ay he, I received your letter of the 1st, yesterday, and can only say in reply, that I quite despair of getting you to understand in its proper light the position you have taken. You have quite forgotten that, as Political Superintendent on the Frontier of Sind, you were bound to follow the policy which I, as Commissioner of Sind, had pointed out to you was the correct one to follow. You have done what neither Jacob, nor I, nor Green, ever did, and that is, persistently adhered to your own views after they had been pointed out to you by me as wrong, and such as I did not wish to be held to. Green having, in communication with and with the assent of the Khan, promised Moolla Mahomed to endeavour to settle the latter's differences with the Khan, I fully con curred in the propriety of your carrying out that promise. But Moolla Mahomed having ill-advisedly and ungratefully rejected the clemency of the Khan, which the intervention of our good offices had secured for him, I pointed out to you that he, Moolla Mahomed, had forfeited all further consideration at our hands, and that nothing more was to be done for him by any British Officer. You, in the first instance, acted most properly in refusing to receive him, when he left Khelat with the expressed purpose of coming to you. Had you continued this course and abandoned all interest in one who had showed himself unworthy of it, all would perhaps have been well, but you still cling to the idea that more should be done for him, and that we were bound to force the Khan to act towards Moolla Mahomed and other Sirdars of Beloochistan according to your ideas, and not as I had laid down and as had been approved by Government, viz. that we were in no way to interfere with the Khan in the management of his country and subjects. This first appeared in your Administration Report of that year, and again, were more objectionable in the paper you submitted in December, the gist of which was that the Khan had behaved wrong only from the first, that all his arrangements for governing his country were wrong, and that we ought to withdraw any support we gave him until he should do what yoti considered justice to subjects who had been repeatedly and were still in open rebellion against his authority. If this was not adopting a course directly contrary to what I had enjoined, and what had been ordered by Government to be carried out, the English language fails to convey the meaning its words are supposed to bear.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/22, ff 142-143</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/22, ff 142-143</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Letter from William Lockyer Merewether, Kurrachee [Karāchi] to Colonel Robert Phayre</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1870/1870</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-29T16:23:19</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>2 folios</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Demi-official letter in which Merewether expresses his vexation at the course that Colonel Phayre has chosen to adopt and stating that he had patiently dealt with the Colonel's objections and mistaken views in the hope that he would eventually realise the errors he was making but that his latest manner towards Khelat [Kalāt], Captain Charles Henry Harrison and Merewether himself had resulted in him no longer being granted this patience.The letter also discusses George William Macauley, whose assistance Colonel Phayre chose not to take advantage of resulting in Macauley leaving both the frontier and the service as he could do not good there with the Colonel; and Captain Robert Sandeman who Merewether considers to be most ignorant on Khelat affairs and whose support was a blind following of Colonel Phayre's ideas.The letter concludes by informing the Colonel that all the papers in the matter have been sent on to the Government of Bomba.A postscript to the letter requests that Colonel Phayre make some better arrangements in his administration as Merewether's office is also under-staffed and cannot cope with the copying of papers for the Colonel on top of their own work.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
