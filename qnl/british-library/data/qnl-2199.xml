I did not see from which way Ahmad entered the Agency compound. At that time all the Agency gates were closed.

I at once went and found that half of the southern window of the Confidential room adjoining P.A f s room was burnt. There were no papers about and nothing was burnt except the half window. 3. - Rajagopalan f s report and the statements of tnose who participated in extinguishing tne fire are submitted here with. As there was no one in the Confidential office at the time it was left by Rajagopalan and Farrash it is difficult,without thorough investigation,to corroborate the statement of the one or the otner. I am, however, making further enquiries wnich will be reported in due course. 4. The window is under repairs. Repairs could not be undertaken earlier as it was decided, in the interest of economy, that we should not buy wood from market but use our own stock which was locked and the key was with Farrash Bashi who had gone to Qatar and came back only yesterday.

He gave the letters to me sealed and I went dov/nstairs to despatch them. 1 think that while sealing the far rash threw down a lighted match and did not see before he went down that everything was all right, and that slowly the wax ana candle have caught fire. When i closed the office at about 1 O’clock I dia not see anything unusual nor did I see anything burnirg - though 1 did not go there and examine it carefully -. I think the door of the window has gradually caught fire and sent out smokes and flame after some time. Fortunatley before any serious damage was done the fire was put out thanks to Muhammad bin Ali • s vl I &gt;« 7/8/37 Sd. K.O.Rajagopalan.Statement of Abdullah bin Fahad Farrash.

I sealed them and gave them to him. ne then returned tnem to me after he had put txiem in two outer covers and askeci me to seal them. I sealed them and while I was doing so at the window, he came near me ana took over the covers from me after tney had been sealed Then he told me to go. The candle stick was still burning when I left. I dia not put out the candle stick as I thought he required it.

From his note attached below you will observe that Mr.Sharma, still insists on hs burdening us with his work although we are already over worked in the absence of the 4th Clerk. You very well know that when Mr.Nasirul Haq fell sick Mr.Zafar Islam was doing the Accountant’s work including all typing in addition to his ow r n deapcth w T ork but ever since Mr.Sharma has taken over charge of the accounts instead of helping khs us he has relieved himself of many petty duties (i) maintenance of 4 private accounts (ii) issuing of chits (iii) maintenance of stores etc In accordance with the principals of office routine extra work is always divided among the various office personnel sol that one or two persons may not be enburdened. The Trade Report figures which Mr.Sharma was keeping from £xkx November last were handed over to me in March last with the pretext that he could not do them owing to his being busy in accounts although he could do them when he undertook to do them in addition to his wwn work since Mr.Zafar Islam-did the accounts in addition to his despatch work during and after Nasirul Haq’s sickness. I am afraid the lack of co-operation in the Government service for which all clerks ere paid may not cause matters worse than are at present in case one of the clerks in English Office may fall seriously sick. In 1937,when I was here I perfectly knrcw that the accounts clerk would type all account matters including office orders issued. Some office orders issued from 1936-1939 are flagged for your perusal v/hich are initialled by the accountant^land indicate that these office orders were typed by the then accountants.
