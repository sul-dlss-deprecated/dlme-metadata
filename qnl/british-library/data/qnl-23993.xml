Xo OMThe celebrations in honour of the Birthday of His Majesty King George VI took place on June 9th. They consisted of (i) Reception of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin »Isa al Khalifah, K.C.I.E.,0.8.1., and members of the Royal Family accompanied by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Mr.C. Dalrymple Belgrade, 6 .B.E. (ii) Reception for the notables of Bahrain (ill) A reception of the American and European communi ties (iv) The representatives of Shaikh »Abdullah bin Qassim of Qatar namely Shaikh Nasir and Saleh bin Mana were also invited separately to a short informal recep tion. (i) Owing to the proximity of the Coronation Cele brations it had been arranged that all receptions should, be of a very informal nature without their customary formality. Accordingly owing to this fact and also to the fact that the majority of the Bahrain Police were not available. His Highness agreed that for his reception a guard of honour should be dispensed with. His Highness and his suite accompanied by the Adviser arrived at 8.35 and were met by the Assistant Political Agent at the head of the stairs. Coffee was followed by sweetmeat and at 9,O’clock after tib and rose water His Highness departed. Shaikh Sir Hamad seemed in excellent spirits and made a very gracious little speech of congratulations on His Majesty’s Birthday. (ii) The Manama and Muharraq notables were received by the Assistant Political Agent in the Court Room of the Agency at 9 O’clock. The normal procedure of t l) Coffee 2) Speeches 3) Sweetmeats 4) Sharbat 5; Tib and rose water r ■was followed. Speeches w r ere read by the representatives-2 of the Arab Conmninity, the Persians, Bastakis, etcetera, the Shiah and Bushiri Persians, the Bahamas, the Muhar- raq Baladieh and the Jews. The Indian Assistant was seated on the right of the Assistant Political Agent and the 12 senior notables were also seated on the dais. The reception lasted about 45 minutes. (iii) Invitations in the usual form had been issued to the European and American communities. A very small number were able to come owing to the fact that it was a working day with the Oil Company. All together 11 guests arrived and were given drinks, biscuits, etcetera, upon the Agency verandah. (iv) Prior to this, the Qatar representatives had come and been given coffee, sweetmeats, sharbat, tib and rose water. They were asked separately as it was difficult either to place them with the Bah-^n merchants or the Royal Family. The general arrangements were very efficiently carried out by the Indian Assistant, the Head Clerk and the Interpreter. (B' r r Dictated on 10th June 1937.Res. P. G No. 32.

We are particularly happy in our good fortune that we have in yourself a member of the Great Indian Civil Service, a Service that always attracted the brilliant brains of the Empire. You have spent a good part of your life in the service of our Motherland, and that also has added to our feelings of regard and respect for you. $ f Allow us to assure you, Sir, of our loyalty to the Crown.
