Prom the letter below it appears that the M.o.1. are trying to go back on the arrangement which we made then for them to stand the expenditure. I rang Mr. Orew and he explained that many such arrangements were made in a hurry early on in the war and his Department were now trying to investigate and clear them up. I pointed out that we felt we had ample justification for asking the M.o.1. to continue to pay; not only had we reason to think that these periodicals were used in the Indian Trade Agent * s Office and public room and in other places, but recently H.M. Minister had asked the M*o. I. to stop the supply of similar periodicals i to Afghan addressees through the post. This small supply, therefore, represented the only expenditure on periodicals for Afghanistan which we asked the M.o.1. to pay. Mr. T&gt;rew saw the force of my argument and was quite prepared to agree to continue the arrangement, provided that we first reviewed the matter by sending a brief enquiry to Kabul on the lines of the attached draft.leleph'one No. EUSton 4321. —w Telegrams:—“MINIFQJE^ f5.\'Ut&gt;N ' In any furtho^ communicatRan on this subject the followinjj'reference should be quoted :— i^sT] ’ &lt; Your reference : * 4X (5 MINISTRY OF INFORMATION, MALET STREET, LONDON, W.C.l. lif&amp;h January, 1943* Dear Sir, ^ i 0 , /I O / I enclose for information a copy of an account rendered to this Department (in con tinuation) for periodicals supplied during the December 1942 quarter by Messrs W.
