By this Article the Government of Saudi Arabia undertook ton maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the •.••••»•*.Sheiks of Gat fir and the Oman Ooaat, who are in special treaty relatione with Him Britannic Majesty.' Hi® Majesty’s Government have, in the past, contended that this- under talcing committed the Gaudi Arabian Government to acceptance erf' the boundaries of those states, as they then existed. Sine© these boundaries have never been defined, the value of this argument is dubious except in the case of Khor-sl-Qdeid. The right of the Sheik of Abu Dhabi to this territory was specifically recognised by His Majesty’s Government as early as 1906 and it can be contended that the tlaudi Arabian Government are similarly committed by the Treaty of Jeda®.

I am told that the programme envisaged for this winter is to extend the work southwards from Dukhan, where a Seismic survey was carried out last winter. The area in which the Seismic party are likely to reach the southern limit of the concession is thus near the west coast, where Saudi Arabia is the adjacent State. In addition I understand that, if there is sufficient time during this cold season, it is proposed that the party should survey some lines right across the Qatar Peninsula. At present it is, however, not intended that these lines should extend to the southern limit of the concession area on the eastern shore of the Peninsula. It therefore seems to me that the subjects of telegram 77 No. 1266 and Longyigg’s letter of the 2nd December are separate. The first appears to refer to the Seismic survey described above, for which I vrould recommend that permission be granted, subject to the provisions of the second paragraph of telegram 1266. The second appears to relate to other activities of the Company and I agree with yourview that Abu Dhabi’s claim to the territory off Umm Said (the proposed pipeline terminal) appears very far /fetched.

The Qatar - Abu Dhabi boundary has never been found. In 1906 we recognised the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi’s title to the Khor al Odeid but we have never recognised any territory to the noth of this as belonging to Abu Dhabi, This is the first indication that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi claims territory lying within the Qatar Peninsula and we have no idea as to the basis of such a claim. On the information available here the Sheikh’s claim appears too far fetched to be taken seriously. It seems more than likely that his object is simply to try to obtain some benefit from oil development at Qatar. 3* I suggest that we inform the Political Resident of the information given to us by Longrigg and say that we do not consider the Sheikh's claim should holdup the Oil Company's survey programme.

Tfaktn the latter point first it seems to that if wc proimse a settlement in any one sec himself in other sectors for any concessions which he could rmlm out that he had offered. So it is very doubtful if it would be nos ibie to divide the frontier up for settlement purposes In any case the vagueness of the frontier between the various segments on the f *Britl8h t? side of the 11m? 9 e.g. hottoon Abti Bbabi and Muscat would make it almost impossible from our point oi view, Moreover previous negotiation© have Ibn Baud would nluost certainly try to componsats /alwaysalwsrs dftaU with the frontier ae a vfodle. Bo I think that it mnst he concluded that If there Is to he any attempt to settle the frontier the question must he tackled as a whole* m regards the desirability or otherwise of altesiptlng to settle the frontier the argument against is now, as always, that Xhn Baud will he upset by any attempt to settle the frontier except on his own taros and that we do not want to impair his goodwill which 1^ useful to ns in many ways, fhe argument in favour of making some attempt to settle the frontier is that the whole of the large area between th^ blue and violet line ana the m&amp; line is potentially oil-hearing. Th re is the danger on the one hand that both Arabian ricen^PotroleuEi Concessions may start prospectisji;40 all sorts of places within this / area* If either of them found oil there would be then a squabble over the royalties deriving there from which would create much more ill- will than any attempt to settle the frontier now* Th®?e is th© further practical disadvantage that if the surveyor© of either Company vmm murdered in the desert there is technically no sovereign in respect of this disputed area to which H*:i*G* or the American OovermiKsnt could turn for redress, m therefore tcilnk that on balance It would be worth making another attempt at persuading Tbn Band to e^groa on a frontier* Th© basis on which we should try to settle should in oar opinion be the RUtedh Line modified to accord with the revised position of the Safaq Hells. In putting it to Xta Baud it /couldAn ' coitld b e pointed out that the Bhole of the ama in dispute is potentially oil-hearing? that the Riyadh Line gives him a good deal more than half of the disputed area and^lt is surely worth his while to give up the fringes of his claim in order to obtain the formal recognition of that he is sovereign over the rest and as such the Ruler to whom royalties on oil found there will he payable. ' It could be suggested that this suggestion would be much better than the neutralisation for oil purposes of the whole area between trie Blue and Violet Lines end the Red Line which appear otherwise to be the only solution which could prevent competetiva drilling by the two oil companies in the disputed area* • 1 ■ &gt;' *■ Ibn Baud would no doubt start by insisting on his full claims* It might then be desirable to revive the suggestion that an Anglo-Smidl pirty should insxiect th© topographical future of th© Base of the Qatar Peninsula, end it might bo worth suggesting that a Joint party might also visit other places about the position of which there is doubt, 0 *g* th© Bofaq. wells* m would hope that this topographical party would establish to the satisfaction of th© yandis that the Jebsl MaJchsh is an integral part of the BuMian ana that the to is only on© Araiq. and that af th© south of the dohel Kakhsh (so© para 40 of Foreign Office printed Mamorandura Ho. 80 E 2203/2203/5). But in the end we shall probably get back * to the position reached in earlier negotiations that Ibn Send insists on receiving the /* 0 ior-ei-od^idKh©i-el-Odel&amp; and the Jebel Hakhah although he might he wil lag to accept the Yellow Line over the rest of its course. The first atgenpt to hresik. this decid^loclc night he to oifer hin dn exchange the extra strip of territor:/ in the south, provided K.M.O. are' still prepared to offer the cession of this territory a point on which are ere consulting the Colonial Office* If this is unsuccessful we might proceed to separate the question of the Khor-el-Odeid from that of the Jebel Hakhsh and offer the southern strip and a counterpart to the Khor-el-Odeid slone. The strip in the south may only he dessrt hut potentially oil-hen ring lihe the rest of the desert. Concurrently we might seek- some special arrangement in respect of the Jehel N&amp;khsh. Here various solutions will have to he consideredi (1) It was suggested in 195® that in respect of the Jehel Ifckhsh area .Petrol cub oncesair ns and Arahian—ainerican Oil. Co.'ipaiiy should reach an agreement for joint working and d! should pjs&amp;vide royalty payments between the Sheikh of Qatar and Xhn Baud. At the time this s^aggestion was rejected with some vigour hy Potroloum Concessions Limited. A nod Ihle variant of this Idea which occurs to us is that a joint zone should he created hut that the contribution should not come only froia our side. That is to say Qatar and Petroleum Concessions I would contribute the Jehel Hakhsh area while Ibn Saud and the Arabian-Arnerican Oil Company would contribute an equal adjacent area s nth of the Conceosion Line. (2) Another possibility 1. t the Jebel— Baud on condi tion that the ^ti*oXewa Oonaesaior Am _ Limited's ccmos#ion goes with it* file Sheikh of Qatar of course have to he c^pensated. It i© true that complaints might he m&amp;cle hy the rican-Aamhlan Company that the ceded territory was covered by their concession from Urn Baud* The answer to those would be l thli ! that whetevar concessions King rbn Bond, may hai given in the post to the American company woulc only apply to territoi-y than under his effective sovereignty or thereafter acquired by him free from all forms of servitude; that it had bean mm6 b clear both to King Ibn Baud and to the Comimny that in the view of His Majesty's Goveranont the legal boundary of Saudi. Arabia was the Blue line; that notwith standing this. His Mai«#t^r # fi Govemment had repaatedly mpTmoe d their wlXlingness to acknowledge mvM sovoreignty over large areas lying to the east of the Blue lin# and ^xtendia up to the so-called Riyadh line; that His Majesty’s Government ware willing to «*&amp;* this actoowled^ortti without Insisting on a farm #f words which would show that the amm had 7]$t been under Saudi sovereignty previously or indeed saying anything about their previous, sovereignty at all; that in thoao areas Ibn Baud would be free as soon a© his had been legally recognised to do as ha Ittad m regard# oil concessions and that from tint point of view of the American company they mlgh ba regarded as a gratuitous and. cost-free addition to the area of their original nonces At; but that on the other hand the territory which ttia MajwW*® Oovormont were yns*™* t0 S lv ® o /to \1 U •• 'r li I I.to King Ibn Saud east again of the Riyadh line (i#e. Jebel Kakhsh) was territory which could only be acknowledged to he under hi© sovereignty on the clear understanding that the instrument of recognition (!) tifeDle it clear that this was territory which had legally been Qatar territory previously and was now being formally ceded to Saudi Arabia (i*e* the instrument would not merely suggest that all that was happening was a conservation of an existing situation, as might happen In the case of the territory to the west of the Riyadh line) and (ii) made it clear that the territory was ceded subject to the acceptance b;/ the new ruler of the concessions granted by the former ruler. I think that on these lines a good case against any complaint by the American company could possibly be made out* (3) It might be possible simply to buy out Ibn Saud in respect of hie claim to the Jebel Kakhsh* Hone of these solution© are very attractive but we may yet be driven to one or other of them. ( 1 ) ie the most acceptable from the Governmental point of view since it involves paying no compensation to anybody. On the other hand it is likely to meet with considerable resistance from both companies. If negotiation© are taken up and despite everything we may be disposed to offer they fail there appear to be twomat. tim whole of the area hetrm&amp;n the Blue ond Violet Um&amp; and the Bed line i® not to be developed by either oil ccrrjpany. This io umacisfrietory on general grounds s ince the oil whioa may lie In this area is needed and it sc&lt;8ns Conceivable that Ibn Baud would accept it. He Bemm to exercise s rie sort of a uthor 1% In ®ost of the disputed area and if he chooses to send his oil company into prospect -•.v, i© In o. rosition to afford them protection* Vo are in a wition to do the sane for Petitions Concessions Limited in most of the disputed area* (ii) to try to arrfmg© with Ibn nrtid that tb® arm between the Riyadh line*Rea line shall iaOl&lt; be exploited by either oil company. Alys less 'Hatiefootony on general gr oun ds since the area sterilised would be relatively small, his course would however have the seriou disadvantage that m should for all practical purposes have recognised Ife«HSeud , s sovereignty up to the fallow itm without obtaining anything in return, on the other hand if he once agreed to tills Ibn Baud would, wo think, be debarred from malting further claiiiB beyond the Red line and m should bo able -to give Petroleum Concessions a reasonable assurance that they could explore up to the Hod line. It would not be entirely useless to have attained this position since there is otherwise the possibility that Ibn Baud may at some time or other claim the Bardhl Oasis which has been reported to ;po 0 scss oil possibilities.

Our Ref: Your Ref, LING HOUSE, DOMINION STREET, LONDON, E.C.2. .29Jb ^pril, 1947 The ^nder-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, ■Whitehall, S.W.l. I have the honour to refer to a conversation which took place at the Foreign Office on the afternoon of 28th April, between Ur. Neville Butler and Mr. Garron on the one side and the undersigned representative of this Company on the other. You are aware that this Company and/or its subsidiaries hold oil Concessions from the Shaikh of Qatar, the various Rulers on the Trucial Coast, and the Sultan of Unseat and Oman, which Concessions were acquired at various dates from 1934 to 1946, mainly between 1936 and 1939. It is the common feature of all these Concessions that the territories covered adjoin, on their inland side, the dominions of H.U. King Ibn Sa’ud: and it is understood that the latter’s frontiers, which thus automatically become the boundaries of the Company’s Concession, have never been delimited. In the case of Qatar, the Company's Concession indicates, by a line on an attached map across the Qatar Peninsula from hast to West towards its base, the boundary of the area covered. It is, however, believed that considerable territory south of that boundary belongs properly to the Shaikh: and in the event of a delimitation between the domaines of the Shaikh and of King Ibn Sa'ud, this Company would wish to extend its Concessional area, by arrangement ith the Shaikh, so as to cover whatever lend might be excluded from Sa’udi Arabia and included in Qatar by the boundary determined. On the Trucial Coast there hasbeen some hinterland demarkation and it would, therefore, be a matter of great interest to the Company to know what approximate or provisional frontier may at the present time be considered as valid vis a vis Sa’udi Arabia: what are the probabilities of a definitive boundary-drawing in the near or fairly near future: and whether in the event of such final boundary-drawing includingin Sa’udi Arabia areas hitherto and at present considered to belong to the Cooioanv’s concessionary territories, it could be arranged that King Ibn oa'ud should agree to respect the Company s acquired ri„ \ therein? i'he frontier as between the hinterland, the Sultanate of oman including its Dhofar province, and Sa’udi Arabia has similarly never been delimited and is equally a matter of interest to this Company, - 2 - Lr. Butler asked the undersigned in conversation what would be the Company’s orderof priority in such boundary delimitation if it should prove' possible to carry it out partially out not wholly. Such order would be, firstly, the boundary at the base o, ^atar Peninsul , secondly, the boun ary from (the neighbourhood of) the base of ^atar^ around the outskirts of the Ruba’ al Khali passing south o une ^ucial Coast and the Oman mountains; and thirdly, the boundary between the Oman Sultanate and Sa’udi Arabia to the South and South oast Ox Ruba al Anal .

RKCiRICrBD , In recent months the question of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and Qatar has come up here in connexion with the activities of Petr ole he Concessions Limited in Qatar and the Arabian American Oil Company in Saudi Arabia, and you should know what has been happening* 2 9 At one of a aeries of meetings in London in November 1946 between united States State Department Repreaentativea and the Ministry of Fuel and Power on oil matters generally, at which the Foreign Office was also represented, the Gaudl- atar Boundary question was raised by the Americans who felt that it was desirable, if possible, to avoid difficult political issues being raised as a result of the activities of the oil companies in the 'no man’s land” at the base of the Qatar Peninsula* The Ministry of Fuel and Power suggested that the British and American Departments concerned should find out from their respective oil companies what their development plans in the disputed area were likely to be and this was agreed upon. Subsequently, and rather over our heads - although the idea had been mooted, we had not agreed to it nor had the India Office — the Ministry of Fuel and Power took up with their United States opposite numbers, before their return to the United States, a suggestion of their own that the American and British Departmenti should make a private agreement with their respective oil companies not to operate in the disputed area at the neck of the Qatar on insula, except with the approval of the two Governments* 3* 'The grave objection to all this from the Foreign Office view point is, of course, that if Ibn Saud hears that we at an official level, have been discussing with the jne’-ienns what he regards as his territory he will be very nnnayed n 3 1c v^o 1” 1938 when a so--ewhat elnilar ■“Uunderetandii aro^e sith him over Qatar (Kastern (^raliia) prints ^.2^0^/2203/^11 of the 3cth June, 1940, paragraph 58). 1 U. .'e have warned tho Ministry of fuel and power and the ambaeay m -’ashlngton of the danger* involved ^t. of aQB rae, ^thaj Aamaam rnav have been done. 9* learn that the otate Department; i did^aas the suggestion on to Aramco who however quite naturally took “te line 6 that they felt entitled to proceed with any exploration or development they might wish in territories which !8 J 33?S*r&lt;w »• ^|‘* r .‘r; JS ” “‘ibfSS „«=» of' that Aramco may now go and s^y vrill net the cat among the pigeons. _ «»o 4 e. 4 thp no*} it ion up to date • We should be glad to U»fhafnc 1 ! ^ e L a LV n anrt^rto' I6n”Lud. «jalght, Jor ««ple, ^g^t^kS grud^lngly^lven in Baud,a reaf inn a ^ion or t E wo^eiirn office print above 1937 - eae paragraphs 50 and 51 ^ ^ 0 ^ eTer ffiucti we may wish to referred to.

The Arabian-American Oil Company considers itself unable to adopt any course but to look to the Saudi Arabian Government for delimitation of the territory in which the company must undertake drilling operations, and to be guided by the SAG in all questions involving such delimitation of that territory. Officials of the company have, therefore, taken the position that they cannot agree to refrain from drilling in territory which might be subject to dispute with some other state, or to enter into a commitment specifically to notify the Department in advance of beginning drilling operations in such territory. They further state.* that, while it was their intention to keep the Department informed concerning their drilling programs as a matter of general policy, such information was not to be considered as being supplied for the purpose of obtaining clearance, because they felt that none was required and that any objections the Department might have on political grounds to particular drilling locations would have to be conveyed by it to the SAG. With respect to the territorial waters of the Persian Gulf, the situation is somewhat less clear. The Arabian-Araerican Oil Company has indicated that it would be willing to delay for a reasonable time any contemplated drilling in territory that might later be subject to dispute, provided there was some prospect of a general settlement of the boundary and other questions certain to develop. They recognized that what constitutes territorial waters of the respective riparian states and what are the respective rights of those states in the sub-sea resources of the Persian Gulf beyond the limits of territorial waters are as yet undetermined; and that it would be in the interest of all concerned for these questions to be settled in advance of possible disputes. They feel, however, that if the natter is not otherwise to be settled, one method of promoting early action toward this ena would be to precipitate the issue by- initiation of drilling operations. The Department is not persuaded, however, that this is a desirable course and would appreciate being aavised whether the British government is prepared to reconsider the decision tentatively taken at London to resolve such matters on an ad hoc basis. The Department would welcome early conversations designed to disclose a feasible basis for general settlement of these questions. Sincerely yours. (Signed) John A.

The manner of our approach to this question must, of course, depend largely on whether the Saudi Government are now likely to be any more amenable than they were in 1933. Ck'afftey-Smith' last letter on this subject (of July 8 th* : 19 R 5 ) was pessimistic and the general concensus of opinion has been that we % are unlikely to get much change out of the Saudi Government at present. There is, however, I suppose. Just a possibility that we might obtain a bargaining counter if it emerged from the present enquiries from the oil companies that, whereas P.G.D. are not particularly anxious to enter the area under/2 . under dispute, P^eaoco are eager to do so. 2, So far as Arainco is concerned it is, strictly speaking, for the Saudi Governcoent rather than the U* 3* GoverYsnent to ensure that they do not enter the disputed area while the boundary is still undefined. would invite your attention in this connection to paragraph 51 of the Foreign Office Print No. 15996 of 30th June, 1940, which states that in 19^7 the &gt;aaudi icabiaTi Government had informed iramc-o (or C.A.3,0.0. as it then was) of the divergencies of opinion between the Saudi Arabian Government and on the matter of the frontier and that H.M. Minister was told that there was therefore no cause for fear that the company would take action in territory which was under dispute. It would therefore seem possible to ensure that no clash occurs between the oil/A oil conipanies (if this is all that is desired) merely by obtaining from the Saudi Government confirmation that Aramco are still under these instructions It does not appear, however, flora the Erint what the Saudi Governments lu definition of_'disputed area” then was , / v ^ and this is clearly a crucial point. If we pressed them for a definition, the Saudi Government would probably claim the Riyadh line as marking the western boundary of the disputed area and Ibn Baud’s red line claim in Qatar as marking the eastern or northern boundary. This would correspond with the arrangement suggested in your letter of 7th December^but we do not think it would be satisfactory since the Riyadh line is not so much a claim of H.M.G. as the most generous offer that H«M*G. are (or were) prepared to make, and IbnSaud*s claim in Qatar must be unacceptable to H.M.G. including as it does not only the Khor SI C^feid which we have recognised as belonging to Abu but also^Jebel Nakhsh which H.M.Ch have recognised as P.C.L’s Qatar concession. We feel, therefore, that if H.M.G. are going to define a ^neutral aone ” they ought to try to insist on a line further v/est than the iiiyadh line for the *4/ western boundary 6the Brown or Green line of 1937 ). At the same time, we have grave doubts whether it would be possible to agree to Tbn Sand’s red line forming the northern/boundary without coirpromising our position. fC* k* As regards ^ suggestion that JLt *f ^neutral zone 1 ’ might be carried right round the Arabian peninsula^ as far as the Men protectorate, we are inclined■ ^ 5. v inclined to think that it would be rvt» UmaJI better to restrict any neutral «cne-to the Qatar area and to try and get tbe Riyadh line accepted as the frontier elsewhere. operating well outside the line claimed by Ibn Saud, but in Lhofar their In Qman ; P.C.L. are exploration programme for the next year 4 ftrvrb M/Jty or so may take them -up to the Riyadh line. I understand that Thesiger, of the Anti-Locust Unit, recently travelled in the Ramlat Mughshin neighbourhood under the Sultan’s auspices and found that the local tribesmen def initely owed alle^gance to the Sultan. 5 . Our first reactions are then that, strictly speaking, the question of limiting tbe oil companies* operations is one between H.M.Gr. and the Saudi Government and,, we ought to be very wary of compromising our case by , ,;sr tki*&lt;4 1 an agreement a defined mutual zone. We/ 9MiA vie are not sure liow 'far it woula be proper to bring the Ansericati Covermsent into aT\y forxaal axrangeraenu but it seenis very difficult to rsake ajny ai'rangeuient with, the .Americans without the cooperation of the Saudi Government• Xt remains to await tne reuort of the U» S.

Loftus was inclined to think that the oil company might W ell be reluctant to disclose its intentions and v/as certainly unlikely to commit itself not to extend its investigations to the 'no-man's land' if the evidence should make this desirable from their point of view. He also felt that, in principle, it was desirable , if possible, to make arrangements whereby oil companies' operations could not precipitate political difficulties such as boundary disputes.-2 - Saudi Arabian Government during the past 30 years or so gested that one way out might be for and the U # S.G. to arrange with the respective oil concessionaires not to undertake any oil operations under their concession rights in disputed areas without first consulting their Government so as to give an opportunity of Anglo-American Government consultation and, if appropriate, consultation with the Saudi Arabian Government* For this purpose I suggested that it might be feasible to adopt as the boundaries of the M disputed areas' the boundary claim by Ibn Saud on the one hand, and the boundary which H.M*G. were prepared to recognise on the other hand; , it might be, I sug gested, that H.M.G’s yellow line and Ibn Saud’s red line would provide the appropriate definition. This would encroach Slightly on the area defined in P.C.L’s Qatar concession, but it does not appear that the Company at present contemplate operations south jof Ibn Saud’s red line, Loftus thought that Aramco were not, themselves, clear where they could or could not operate in the neighbourhood of the Qatar Peninsula and I said I thought that P,C # L, also were in some doubt, though they had been told by H,M.G. that their concession extended to the line marked in red circles on the map (which, in fact, is the line defined in P.C.L’s concession, though I did not explain this in so many words to Loftus). Loftus was generally inclined to favour an arrangement on these lines as an insurance against, random operations by the oil companies, and it was left that we would further consider this question and make proposals in due* course to the State Department* Ue would, however, first await information from the latter about tne result of their enquiries into Araxaco’s programme of development. /IfIf an arrangement on these lines appears satisfactory ?to you and the Foreign Office, it will have .the effect; defining ''i--' a 'neutral zone', not only between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, but i' between all the P.C.L. concessions in the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Oman on the one hand, and Aramco’s Saudi Arabian concession on the other; and the neutral zone would not be a no-man's- land except in the sense that prior notice would have to be given by the oil companies if any of them should wish to undertake operations in it* It may be that this kind of arrangement would have to be openly discussed by H.M*G* with Ibn Baud, and not confined to a working arrangement between H.M.G. and the U.S.G-* Sven so, this might be better than leaving the position in its present uncertainty* I am sending a copy of this i I .

Moreover, one of Ibn Baud 1 s claims intrudes on the P.C.L. concession area so defined. Would it, however, be feasible to offer the P.C.L. concession line, or some other similar line across the Qatar Peninsula, to the Americans as an informal frontier beyond vfoich we would arrange with P.C.L. that they also would not operate without consulting -H.M.

(d) It may be that an 'arrangement on these lines could not be put into ex pect by the State Department vis-€t—vis Csitex or that the arrangement would come to the ears of xfcn Baud. On the former point, however, it might /beI - 3 be worth at least discussing the possibility with the State Department; and onVfche.-I&amp;ttg jl^oint -j e should have been consistent with the attitude we took in our last discussions v/ith Ibn Saud and, in any case, would we be any worse off than without any attempt at an arrangement with the State Department on these lines $ Further, without some such arrangement, there is the risk that a discovery by one of the companies may precipitate all these difficulties in a more acute form 0 It may be that you would feel that this question should be Pefi- over until we hear from the State Department whether Caltex have in mind any investigations in this area. It seems possible, however, that we shall find that the companies will not be pre pared to commit themselves and it seems to me that any arrange ment on these lines which could be made with the State Department would help towards keeping the position under control.

Do you think that something on the following lines would be worth while ? . (a) To discuss in a little more detail with the State Department the uncertainty about the Qatar/Saudi Arabia boundary line.In essence, it amounts to this; oil has been proved in Qatar in the Jebal Dukhan area and more structures may wr be proved anywhere along the coastal strip on the West; side of Qatar* Elsewhere the oil possibilities are specu lative until the Company’s programme of geophysical exploration has been completed and the more promising structures tested by sinking a well* As regards the intentions of the Arabian American people, we are, relatively speaking, in the dark. Oil has been proved at Qatif, Danmam and Abqaiq lying in the coastal area of the Arabian mainland roughly west of Bahrein Island. How ARAMCO assess: the possibilities elsewhere in their concession area we do not know and we have no means of telling where they are likely to concentrate their search in the next year or ( two. They have shown some exploration activity at the head of the Bahr As Salwa which is, of course, quite close to the Qatar concession boundary; it is natural that they should be interested in the possibilities here in view of the alignment of the structures in Qatar and Bahrein, but we have no evidence to show that they are concentrating on this area more than others. I feel I should mention at this stage the possibility that frontier questions may be complicated by -the implications of the recent American and Mexican declaration c la lining jurisdiction over the sea bed opposite their coasts as far out as the 100 fathom line. If H.M.G. associates itself with the principles of the American action the whole of the Persian Gulf will, as you are well aware, come within the definition of ^continental shelf' as being shallower than 100 fathoms. A portioning of the sea bed of the Persian Gulf would be the logical conclusion and land under the waters of the Gulf of Bahrein seems likely to be an area of prime interest to dl companies. /The% - 2 - The foregoing suggests that the possibility does exist that ARAMCO and P.G*L. operations might converge in the neighbourhood of Salwa. Elsewhere the possibility of overlapping between the operations of the two companies seems relatively remote. We have good reason to believe that P.C.L. at present do not contemplate exploration or development in the hinterland of the coastal belt :r' ning from the Qatar peninsula through the Trucial Sheikhdoms, Muscat and Oman. Their views may change as they gather knowledge from their geophysical research, but, for the present at any rate, they are not interested in any area lying inland from even the outermost Saudi Arabian frontier discussed in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 30th June, 192*0 which is mentioned in your letter, i.e. the approximate line claimed as a frontier by Ibn Saud on the 3rd Apri^., 1935* I do not think that any pooling or joint operation arrangements on the lines contemplated in paragraph k of your letter would appeal to P.C.L. or AKAMCO. There are no trade connections between the American components in each of these groups or between the two groups themselves; in fact, competition between the two is one of the problems of the future. Moreover, joint arrangements of this kind have been tried and, in many cases, have come to grief from internal stresses caused by a divergence between the interests of the component groups. The International Petroleum Commission contemplated by the Anglo-American Oil Agreement might possibly^ help in finding a solution to a conflict of interests of this kind, but, with the resignation of Ickes, it is open to doubt whether the Agreement will be ratified by the Americans. The foregoing is necessarily rather speculative. From the oib point of view we would tend to favour sttlement of the frontiers fairly soon because the issues will become so complicated if oil is found in or near the undecided frontier areas. There will undoub tedly be large new discoveries of oil in the Persian Gulf area, but whether and, if so, when they will occur/ in the no s ^ are considering cannot he foreseen for the reasons I have indxcated.

Very briefly the position is that n in 1935 offered the so called Riyadh Line' to Ibn Saud f 4 in * which offer was rejected mainly an account of the Saudi Government’s reluctance to give up their claims to the » * ^ l* /J/Ca ftM+t*** y ^ebel Nakshs .on the western side of the base and the ^ i / 4 Khor El Odeid, an inlet opposite the Gebel Nakshs on the eastern side. H.M.G. subsequently considered whether they could meet Ibn Saud by accepting his claims to one or other of these places but they both had to be ruled out - the Gebel Nakshs because it is within theAJLO.C’s (present V ‘ Petroleum Concessions Ltd’s) Qatar concession and Lord Cadman strongly opposed any concession on the point; and +C- the Khor El Odeid because of a promise in 1906 to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that we regarded it as within hxs territory. £ There has recently been some correspondence between the Legation at Jedda)4 the Foreign Office, the Political Resident of the Government of India and ourselves on the question whether the present is a suitable time to make a move to come to some agreement with Ibn Saud on the question of the South-Eastern frontiers* The general opinion has u been that the present is not a suitable opportunity for re-opening this question. One ia&amp;er important aspect, however, about which we have been somewhat in the dark is the intentions of the Oil Companies, both C.A.S. Overseas in Saudi Arabia and P.C.L. in Qatar, the Trucial Coastand Muscat. There is ’^possibility, perhaps a probability, to consider that the question of the frontiers will/be brc '^^^ ^ in an acute form by the operations of the two Oil Companies/in an area regarded try both as being within the limits of their own concession. This is perhaps most likely to happen cm the Qatar itontier as we gather that P.C.L. are now going ahead in the^febel Dukhan Jrea which contains an established oilfield and from which they may possibly wish to extend their operations to the^ebel Nalpjh#. | We should, therefore, be glad of any information you can let us have as to the plans of the respective Oil Con^anies. P.C.L. were I think recently told by the foreign Ofiice in answer to ; f an enquiry by theca that it was not possible to give them any definite information about the location of the South Eastern ^ /f&amp;l h*-(**f a*v***# Frontiers of Saudi Arabia and alt hough-Ury .pnaaureafriy know^the ©osiLien about the frontier in the Qatar ^rea ao a reouI-4—ef the A f Xivt-' '-Vi *%-&gt;&lt; ^ discussions with Lord Cadtaan in 193^* we^think^git would be ) /% ~ desirable for you not to say anything to the Company at the moment juurU* to suggest that there is any possibility of adjustment with I bn Saud being negotiated.

Personally, I should not be inclined to reject Mr.Jordan’s opinion quite sc automatically as he and some others do. It is quite a long time - 7 or 8 years, I think - since this matter was discussed, except among ourselves, and a good deal has happened during those years. I do not see why one should necessarily conclude that the intervening events have hardened the attitude of the ether parties. It might, on the other hand, be worth while, I should have thought, to try some means of testing the attitude of the other parties to see whether it has not perhaps modified in a direction favourable to an understanding with us. Mr.Grafftey-Smith mentions two considerations as affecting Ibn Saud in this matter, apparently to the exclusion of any others, namely: (1) Ancestral piety; (2) A preference for tribal allegiancies in defining frontiers, rather than the factors which are more usually applied in different conditions elsewhere. No doubt there is great force in the latter point, ^especially as regards the vast desert spaces in the Muscat bulge^ covering the Ruba-al-Khali. Indeed, I fancy we may have somewhat weakened our case in the past by drawing the line too far westwards without any reasons of sufficient substance to support it. But I should think that the tribal allegiance argument applies with less force to the crucial strip at the ■Pr,n+. nf the Qatar peninsula, where at least we have geogiap y in our favour. As to ancestral piety, no doubt there is force m /'\n'K 4 - +hn-§-. this motive has been /strongly2. Strongly reinforced in the past by intense anxiety not to let L anything that might have a financial significance. This anxiety may now, as Jordan pointed out, be considerably weakened as regards the Qatar peninsula, by &amp; ' „ Saud has an assured prospect of riches beyond the dreams of avarice from other areas and need not bother rnueix acou apparently negligible strip where he is up against us. Let us not forget that Ibn Saud has a genuine feeling of regard and gratitude for H.M.G. It is not xor nothing that we coine next after Allah in his professions of faitn. I do not believe he relishes his increasing dependence on the Americans, still less the rather crude manner in which they are constantly trying to take advantage of it, and it may well be that the increasing closeness of his relations with the Americans serves as a factor inclining him to preserve and cultivate good relations with us rather than the contrary. The price of a settlement with us over the frontier, meeting our conditions as regards the foot of the Qatar peninsula while we make concessions to him lower down, may not seem to him so heavy as it did 8 or 10 years ago, and he may be more inclined to pay it. Assuming he would be glad to settle this difference on reasonable terms, I should have thought that it would be worth while to find out whether there isn't now a closer approximation between his and our ideas of what would be reasonable than there was when we last discussed it with him some 8 years ago. He and the Americans must know, one would suppose, of the recently re newed activities of the Petroleum Concessions Company in Qatar, which is very close to, if it doesn't actually touch upon, the disputed territory. Is it not odd that if their feelings have undergone no change they should not have made some move about it 1 ? It is a long time also since we had any news of the attitude of the Oil Companies. It was in 1938, I think, that the Foreign Office made a somewhat strange approach to lord Cadman (without apparently our knowing about it at the /timetime) and suggested that he should compromise with the American interests on the basis of joint exploitation of the disputed area in Q,atar. Lord Cadman naturally rejected this (paragraphs 54 and 55 of the main Foreign Office print). Now Petroleum Concessions ltd.* are on the verge of active operations in this neighbourhood, if they haven*t actually started them, and if there is anything like the same sensitivity as 'there was on the other side, it might be expected that the matter will come to a head at any moment. The only positive suggestion Mr .Graff tey-Smith makes is that in case| of sudden crisis we fall back on the idea of a unilateral declaration set out in paragraphs 43 - 45 of the Foreign Office memorandum. But I don't think the idea underlying those paragraphs was to wait until something happened before acting, but rather to forestall untoward developments by making the extent of our interest clear so that anyone encroaching upon it should at least know what they had to reckon with. If we knew more exactly what Petroleum Concessions Ltd., are now actually doing in the Qatar^ peninsula, we might feel that such unilateral action could not be further delayed. The Government of India, I see, deal with this aspect in their telegram of the 22nd May last. They say the decision must largely expend upon programmes of the Oil Companies regarding which &lt;c we^(i.e. the Government of India) have inadequate informa tion, and as far as I can see from the file we (i.e. the India Office) do not know much more than the Government of India did. Kas this idea of finding out what the Oil Companies^ are actually up to been followed up at all, or did the Foreign Office simply decide to accept Graff tey-Smith's view and lie low? If the latter, we cannot lie low indefinitely, and perhaps not very much longer, unless the idea of a unilatera declaration has been dropped. I should have thought (but I can see no sign of it on the file) that the Petroleum Department would have been brought into the discussion, and that throug them we should have been advised of the Oil Companies' plans on either side, and further, whether it is at all feasible to pursue eituei At between theOil Companies. Such an understanding would have to act end, I should think, beyond the disputed question of the Qatar peninsula (which was all that the Foreign Of!ice proposed to Lord Cadman in 193o, when they seem to have suggested that he should give something away without getting'anything in return), and might embrace an arrangement whereby they respected each others position mutually in areas already covered by active operations, or the subject of concessions providing for active operations, or the subject of indis putable concessions; disputed and unexploited areas would have to be neutralised or sterilised by an arrangement for joint operation, pooling royalties and. sharing profits. ITobably there is some relation between these difficulties over the Saudi Arabian frontier and the Anglo- American discussions which have been talcing place with a view to an international oil agreement. I am in the daric about this, and do not know whether they have yet terminated satisfactorily. Do they provide machinery for the settlement of territorial rivalries between different exploiting interests'? It may be that the answer to some of the points I have raised above is^m suspense pending the outcome of these discussions. Even so, does it not need to be borne in mind that the issue may be forced upon us and that we cannot wait too long*? ' * I am not quite clear as to the precise division of responsibility between us and the Foreign Office. Am I right in thinking that we are primarily responsible so far as the principalities on the Arabian seaboard of the Jersian Gulf are concerned, while the Foreign Office are primarily responsible for the mainland of the Arabian peninsula, except where it impinges upon the coastal principalities on the one hand, and the Colonial Office interests associated with Aden in the south and southwest, on the other. b (Ll //vXv li.i Under Secretary of State You may care ’to have a look at the papers on tais file on the%exed subject of the South Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia.

I regret that I can see no justification for the optimism expressed in Jordan’s letter to you of January 18th, last, which reads to me like wishful thinking carried to the point of self-deception. 3. Our case, in all its weakness, is summarised in paragraph 37 of the Foreign Office memorandum on Ibn Baud’s Claims (E 2203/2203/25: 15997). The King’s intransigeance is apparent in paragraphs 19—22, 33 and 40 of the companion memorandum on the South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia (15996). Bullard’s views in paragraphs 42 and 52 of that document are impressive. 4. We are up against two principles of policy which Ibn Saud has always followed: his sense of ancestral obligation to win back all the lands ever ruled by Saud ibn Abdel Aziz in the early XIX century, and his conviction that tribal allegiances count for more than co-ordinates on a map in defining the territorial limits of sovereignty. I cannot conceive of his abandoning these standards for the reasons given in the first and fourth sections of Jordan’s fourth paragraph. (The second section can hardly be taken seriously, and the third is out of date). 5. There was a good case for attempting settlement of this frontier question during the war period when Ibn Saud was solely dependent upon His Majesty’s Government for supplies and subsidy. But we have missed that boat. 1 e are now giving him notably less than the Americans are, and their power to injure him is greater than our own. In the matter of the South-Eastern frontier, their interests conflict with ours. 6. It is possible that, if negotiations were opened again on a 'poet-war'basis, Ibn Saud would raise the thorny question of Akaba and his Northern frontiers also. I doubt if wo want this. If the reason a or new negotiations is our own urgent need of a settlement, our chances are by that much less favourable. 7. I am sorry that this letter should be so unconst rue tive. Our Own policy has been somewhat passive during the twenty—odd years Baxter, Esq., C.M.G., M.C., Foreign Office. ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL LETTER No. 3 2 11 AUu id 4 o FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT., INDIA OFFICEyears since the Ojair meeting. Nothing seems to have been done to establish the authority of the Shaikhs, in whose name we speak, over the territories in dispute, although the Beckett minute of August 29th, 1934 made such authority the main criterion of sovereignty. I can only suggest that, in case of a sudden crisis, we fall back on the rather unsatis factory unilateral declaration suggested in paragraphs 43-45 of the Memorandum on Frontiers. The politically 'most comfortable solution would obvioualy be that vainly sought in January 1938, for an agreement between the British and American oil interests concerned. The next best, providing for a cession of the Khor—el—Odeid in exchange for recog— _ — nition of the Jebel Nakhsh as in Qatar, seems to be equally unobtainable, and this might well no longer be admitted as acceptable by Ibn Saud. J recommend, therefore, that we let sleeping dogs lie, though their sleep is by now very precarious. I recommend also, however, that in the course of the Amir Faisal s impending visit to London*, he should be allowed to hear how much His Majesty’s Government regret Ibn Baud’s inability to agree on a settlement of this problem. His Royal Highness will inevitably make to the Foreign Secretary many protestations of his father’s friendship and gratitude tov/ards His Majesty’s Government; and some such comment, uttered more in sorrow than anger, would do no harm at all, and might do good. 9. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Yours ever, (Signed) L.B. Grafftey-Smith.WitV! t* &lt; Under S e. - Jordan s letter was copied to the India Office who subsequently sent it to the Govermaent of India and the Political Resident for their observations# These have now come in and I enclose a copy of each. 3* As you will see there is a difference of opinion between Prior and the Government of India. The former considers that we should let the matter rest until Ibn Baud’s death (subject to your views), whereas the latter would like to adopt Jordan’s advice and try to get an agreed settlement now. The India Office have come to no decision so far. 4. A settlement of this long outstanding question is undoubtedly to be desired partly because the absence of any agreed frontier might lead to trouble between Ibn Baud and one of the Gulf rulers under our protection, but chiefly because the operations of one or other of the rival oil companies may at any moment raise the whole problem in a form which might create serious difficulties between us and the Americans. On the other hand, in view of Ibn Sand’s intransigeanee in the past, we hesitate to re-open this question unless we have some hope that he v/ill prove more accommodating than he has been hitherto. 5. Jordan thought there was such a hope, and he also felt that no harm would be done by discussing the problem with Ibn Saud, even if the discussions were to show that agreement could not be reached. 6. We shall be very glad to know how you regard this problem; it vrould, we think, be best not to mention the matter to the Saudis before it has been further considered here.

Our successive offers to Ibn Saud, his claims and those of the Sultan of Muscat can most clearly be seen from the map appended to Memorandum 'A'. Very briefly, the position is that in 1935 we offered the Riyadh Line to Ibn Saud which offer was rejected mainly on account of the Saudi Government’s reluctance to give up their claims to the Jebel Nakhsh and the Khor-El-Odeid. We subsequently considered whether we could meet him by accepting his claims* to one or other of these places but they both had to be ruled out^— £he Jebel Nakhsh because it is within the Anglo Iranian Oil Company’s Qatar concession and Lord Cadman was strongly opposed to any concession on the points and the Khor-El-Odeid because of H.M.G's statement in 1906 to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that we regarded it as within his territory, in view of which the India Office and the Government of India expressed themselves most strongly opposed to any concession to Ibn Saud. As regards the most recent correspondence which we now have under consideration, it will be seen that there is seme diversity of opinion as to what steps it may now be possible to take; (1) Sir Jordan, the late Minister at Jedda, expressed the opinion thar the present moment was a favourable opportunity for making some move, (2) Sir Geoffrey Prior is opposed to making any move and suggests that we should await Ibn Baud’s death, ( 3 ) The Government of India appear to be in favour of making some move, though they do not specify exactly what. ^ tW izj rj&amp;. 1 Mr.Grafftey-Smith, who has recently taken up the post as Minister in Jedda, has ^ j not yet expressed any opinion. The questions which will have to be decided are very briefly:- (1) Are we opposed to making any further concessions to Ibn Saud in respect of Jebel Nakhsh, Khor-El-Odeid or anywhere else? Petroleum Concessions Ltd. will no doubt be equally opposed to ng any concession as regards Jebel Nakhshj I do not see why we should modify our attitude as regards Khor-El-Odeid; as regards concessions elsewhere, there is very little more we can offer without coming into conflict with the Sultan of Muscat’s claims, and since we know so little about the oil potentialities of the Ruba-Al-Xhali any step will be a step rather in the dark. (2) If we do not make any concession, will Ibn Saud be likely to play? ^ Grafftey-Smith is in the best position to express an opinion on this and we must await his view* (3) If we come to no arrangement with Ibn Saud, is the situation likely to deteriorate still further or not? On the assumption that Ibn Saud’s influence will continue to increase with the tribes of South Eastern Arabia and that the American Oil Company will continue to press ahead with its oil exploration and development, it would appear likely that the situation will deteriorate. Much of the territory in question is“reskullius“and he who can exert his influence in it will be able 4 *~ «-im -for the sovereignty of the territory* t» x * - X PC auxe; to base a claim for the sovereignty of the territory* are in no position to make counter-penetration from Muscat or the We Trucial Coast. /wINDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL S.W.l.

Every time we have joined issue with Ibn Saud over this claim, however, we have yielded very substantial areas without gaining anything at all. The first concession was Rendel*s »deaert zone’ line (Foreign Office Despatch Fo . E 6769/279/91, dated 7th Novem ber 1934 ' * ' ~~ ' — t o India office). iText came the Green Line (Foreign office te legram Ho.8, dated 16th January 19 35 to Jeada), moving Ibn Baud’s line further East. This was followed by the Brown Line, making substantial concessions Eastwards (Foreign Office telegram ITo.7Q dated 1st May 1955 to Jedda)._ If this was insufficient the further concession of the Yellow Line was to be offered (ibid, para 6). Tnen came tne Riyadh Line , with the possibility of a further concession, suoject to Muscat interests (Enclosure 1 to Jedaa Despatch Lo.Soi, dated 10th December 1935 to the Foreign Office). Except for the Kadrarnaut and Aden areas this was not far short o± Ibn Baud’s claim. It is therefore difficult to agret with the remark in paragraph 7 of Jordan’s Despatch dated the 18th January 1945 that if agreement cannot be reached the present situation is in no way compromised. / 3 * n* * R.T.Feel Esquire, C.B.B., M.w., The India office?

You will see from Jordan’s letter of 18th January that he considers we should make another attempt to reach agreement with Ibn Saud on this question^ and that the present moment is probably as propitious a time for such an approach to Ibn Saud as we are likely to have in the forseeable future. The last sentence of the fourth paragraph of Jordan’s letter seems to suggest that we might be able to obtain an agreement regarding the Qatar frontier if we were prepared to concede territory in the south. i The question must be deferred until our new Minister at Jedda, Grafftey-Smith (to whom we showed the correspondence before he left London) has settled in and has been able to form an opinion on the subject. Meanwhile, we should be glad to receive any observations you may wish to offer.

He was activated more hy political reasons, e. g. 8 w ^ seri ^ n E - of the situation in the Middle East over Palestine or the Levant States though he was alive to the possibility of the Americans making every effort to induce Ibn Saud to stand °vQ ^ r)S ^ i an y cession of so-called tribal territory which, should Ibn Saud gain his l -point, would form part of the United States concession. . . ^ -f- given the matter considerable thought before raising it in the despatch above referred to, and it appears to me that we are, at the present time, in a more favourable position from which to effect a settlement than we have been in the past. ? ' „ . j Firstly, Miere is now no doubt in the mind of Ibn Saud that -he possesses in : Saudi Arabia oil resources which will bring J him and his successors a considerable revenue for hundreds of years to come. He has claimed to me that the richest oil bearing areas in his domains are not included in the United States company’s concession, but that he does not intend to grant any further concessions for oil at present. When the previous- negotiations were carried out there was no certainty that oil existed in its present known large quantities and consequently Tbn Saud, knowing of the Petroleum Concessions Ltd. ’s concession pn the Qatar peninsular may have attached considerable importance to the potential oil-bearing capacity of the Jebel Nakhsh area. I feel that with the vast reserves of oil now known to be in his country the small area embracing Jebel Nakhsh has lost much of its value for him and he may now be more amenable io a settlement than formerly when he no doubt considered that the area in question represented- wealth* Secondly, Ibn Saud has been impressing on his surrounding Arab neighbours the necessity of falling into line with British aims and policy, vide his advice to the Imam Yahya of the Yemen and more recently to Shukri Kuwaitli, and I think that it could C. W. Baxter, Esq., C. M. G. , M. C. , FOREIGN OFFICE, LONDON, /be&lt;? - ■ questions with us* ThircUv we have given him over the last five years something like ten million ooints sterling t&gt;y way of a subsidy to tide him ove? difficult war years when pilgrimages were impossible or restricted. This sum applied to the purpose, could ,a bought the Jebel Nakhsh area several times over and I do think that he is ungrateful for the assistance which we have given and are still giving to him. Fourthly, both Ihn Baud and the United States oil company consider that the Rubs’ - al—Khali is a potentially large oil-bearing area, consequently any territorial concession in that area has a greater attraction for thim now than it hap. formerly when it was considered only waste lands* 5* Certainly I do not think that much headway can be made by taking up the case on purely legal grounds. We have no legal justification for ceding Khor-el-Odeid to fon Baud against the Jebel Rakhsh area and our legal claim on behalf of the Sheikh of Qatar to Jebel Nakhsh is no stronger than, if as strong »as, Ibn Baud’s, though geographically there is no doubt that it forms an integral *part of the Qatar peninsula. 6 * Under .Article Three of the Concession Agreement the United States interests have ”a preference right- to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far West of the Westerly boundary of the exclusive area as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations.” This in fact means that they have a preference rpght to obtain an oil concession over the whole of the sedimentary formation of Eastern Saudi Arabia and the territory included in this preference area and outside the exclusive area is supposed to be some of the richest oil-bearing areas in the country. Distance and communications militate against developments in this area at present unless a pipe-line is built to the Mediterranean, but it means that the United States interests have a claim to the whole of the oil-bearing territory of Saudi Arabia, covering thousands of square miles and for them the Jebel Nakhsh area, except for its accessibility, represents but an infinitesimal section of the area available. Therefore they also may not be inclined to attach too great an importance to it at the present time in view of their gigantic prospects over the rest of the country. ' * 7 * While of course I cannot guarantee that discussions with, ibn Baud on the^ above lines will lead to a successful conclusion, I can see no reason why they should lead to acrimonious exchanges. They should stand a fair* chance of_ success and if agreement cannot oe reached the present situation is in no way compromised. Yours sincerely, (J 3 gd„ ) s. R.

If this difficulty were got out of fhe way it might be possible to reach a settlement with Ibn Saud over the rest of his south-eastern frontier, for with development at iias Tanura it may well be that Ibn Saud no longer regards his claim on Khor al Odeid as a vital interest, while his gratitude to His Majesty's Government for favoursIf I s ; . pCi e»' v ' favours received during the Y/ar and his continued dependence on their supporf might incline him to come to a settlement acceptable to His Majesty's Government, the Trucial Coast Shaikhs, the Sultan of Muscat, and Aden* Is there then any solution of ■'■he Jebel Hakhsh difficulty ? Would it be worth while considering here too, as we have suggested in the case of the Kuwait Heuiral Zone, a joint concession granted by the two Rulers to their two oil concessionaires ? We recognise the objections' to such a course, but it may.be that on a broad view the advantage of achieving a settled frontier to the South-last and South is sufficient to outweigh other considerations 5* It is of course true that even when Baud's 'Forward Policy' towards the south-east is checked by an agreed frontier definition there remains the considerable problem of sorting out the rival claims of frucial Coast Shaikhs and hinterland tribes over potentially valuable areas such as Jebel Jf’aiyah and Jebel Hafi+ ; arid we must not fMV.et that Muscat claims extend as far q north-west as the Baraimi oasis* This is a sufficiently ugly problem in itself but once given a settled frontier with Ita Baud it would not seem impossible to claim tha + the remaining problem is a more or less domestic aiiair ior se+tlement between the rival claimants under His Ma.iesty's Government's auspices, and that lor all Dractical purposes the whole area from Khor al Odeid round to Dhofar, east, south-east and south of acknowledged Saudi territory, is covered by concessions already granted to Petroleum . Companies Limited by the Sul -an and he irucial Coast•5^ aware,^the Persian Coast south-east of Bushire is geologically not particularly promising. But we understand that applications are being made for concessions in other parts of Persia both by Bri+ish and United States interests and we should be glad to be kept inf termed of developments, particularly in hast Persia, for it is perhaps not altogether unreasonable to expect that the interests succeeding in hast Persia would be well placed to extend into Afghanistan. There have been pointers to indicate an American interest in the Afghan oil potential and we have yet to learn that any Bri x ish company has displayed any concern. While admittedly we are dealing with possibly far-fetched hypotheses it is, we conceive, not impossible that there might be considerable oil strikes on both sides of the Helmand, and if these were of real significance then it is again not beyond the realm of possibility that in the absence of # deep water ports east, of Bandar Abbas a demand might arise for pipe-line construction to Karachi. However distant this prospect may be, i f is one which cannot be entirely^ ignored and it is not one which we should particularly wish to see developing from American enterprise. . /To revert to the @ulf. We recognise that Delhi is not the best centre from which to view the problems involved in their true perspective, since we have neither the close acquaintance with the problem on the ground that prior possesses nor the world view which can only be taken in London, fe are sending a copy or this letter to Prior and are asking him to telegraph briefly his comments both to you and to ourselves. Time is short for we gather that discussions on the m technicaltechnical level at any rate are likely to begin in the near future. Incidentally, when the discussions move to the political plane ancf if - as we hope - they take place in London, might we suggest that Laithwaite should be briefed to watch our corner so far as the Gulf goes ?

Copy No 79 (15998) T 1203/2203/25] Additional Memorandum on the Subject of the Correspondence exchanged during 1938 and 1939 between the Foreign Office and the India Office on the Subject of the proposed Cession of Khor-el-Odeid to the Government of Saudi Arabia. WHEN in March 1938 Sir R. Bullard received Fuad Bey’s plan for the settlement of the question of the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia( J ), of which the basis was the cession of either the Jebel Nakhsh or Khor-el-Odeid by His Majesty’s Government to Saudi Arabia, His Majesty’s Minister gave the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs no hint that he thought a compromise on these lines possible, and said that any reply he gave would be purely personal. 2 . For reasons explained elsewheref 1 ) it was impossible to consider the cession of the Jebel Nakhsh, and it was decided therefore to invite the views of His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the proposal to cede the area adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid. 3. In his report to the Foreign Office, Sir R. Bullard stated that in his opinion the scheme proposed offered the possibility of a final removal of the sole major obstacle in Anglo-Saudi relations—other than Palestine. 4. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India, however, put forward strong arguments against any further concession, and these considerations were repeated and reinforced in a letter which the India Office sent to the Foreign Office on the 3 rd May, 1938. 5 . The importance of retaining and promoting Ibn Sand’s goodwill towards e. 2679/150/ His Majesty’s Government was acknowledged in this letter, but doubts were 91 ( 1938 ). raised as to whether the offer of the cession of Khor-el-Odeid would go far towards promoting this aim, while it would certainly be a grave source of danger to British influence amongst the Trucial Sheikhs in the Persian Gulf. The opinion expressed by Sir R. Bullard in March 1937 was quoted, when he “ doubted whether the transfer would be worth the making, since it would not give Ibn Sand the port he needs, while we should have to make a political sacrifice without gaining the advantage which I think we should stand to gain from any improvement in Ibn Saud’s economic position.” The cession of the Khor-el-Odeid would be impossible without the consent of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and, as he was apparently in no danger from Saudi or Wahabi expansion, it would be superfluous to offer him financial compensation; in fact, any attempt to purchase his consent would react most unfavourably on British prestige among the protected rulers in the Gulf. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi could also reasonably expect an assurance that his frontier would be respected, and would probably demand not merely diplomatic intervention, but a guarantee of protection in the event of the violation of his territory. Finally, it was suggested that there were strong arguments against allowing Saudi Arabian expansion on the Trucial Coast, and allowing the line of protected States to be broken. It was maintained that these arguments had lost none of their former validity; that the strategic importance of the area along the Arab coast of the Gulf precluded any weakening of British influence among the minor sheikhs; and that the increase of Ibn Saud s influence at the expense of His Majesty’s Government, and the impression which might be spread abroad that His Majesty’s Government were in fact afraid of him, would be particularly unfortunate at a moment when the Trucial Sheikhs were in a difficult mood and inclined to flout the wishes of His Majesty s Government. . , i - T i • i 0 two months the Foreign Office replied on the 1st July in a letter e. 2579/150/ which set forth the point of view as a result of which the offei of cession of the ^ C) See separate memorandum, with maps, entitled “ The South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi u Arabia.” E 2203/2203/25 ; June 30, 1940 ; Confidential, No. 15996. 11306—3 [22284—3] B, „ , .

From the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, the second alternative was far and away the better. This could only be secured by ceding to Ibn Saud either the Jebel Nakhsh, which was impossible,( 3 ) or the Khor-el-Odeic It was suggested that the surrender of this small area of empty desert wouio oe a matter of little consequence to the sheikh, whereas it would please Ibn Saud toth on the grounds of prestige and as a possible corridor for an oil piped me. 11 tins argument had no force with the sheikh, it was suggested that some compensation would have to be considered either in the form of a money payment or a guarantee that, in the event of aggression, His Majesty’s Government would afford him more than merely diplomatic intervention. Payment of a sum of money was distasteful, in that it brought a questionable element into a settlement wnicn really could be justified on its merits, but, if some such arrangement was essentia , His Majesty’s Government ought to be prepared to pay £25,000, or even more, to secure a settlement. The alternative, an assurance of protection, could not be taken to apply to tribal raids from Saudi Arabia, and the undertaking should be so worded'that it applied only in the event of a major aggression against Abu Dhabi on the part of the territorial sovereign on the other side ot the frontier. The Foreign Office were inclined to think that some such settlement would not materially increase in practice the responsibilities of His Majesty a Government in that area. Their interests in the air route and in oil uiud necessarily make it impossible for them to be indifferent to any threat to the territories of the Tracial Sheikhs. The Foreign Office agreed, however, that every effort should be made to avoid giving the additional commitment involved in a definite guarantee of any frontier which might be subsequently demarcated, raid to limit our support to a promise of energetic intervention with Ibn Sand or his successors should they disregard the new frontiers. It was suggested that Has Majesty’s Government had in this matter a right to insist on their point of view, since in fact the Tracial Sheikhs could not hold out for a day against Ibn Baud without His Majesty’s Government’s protection and support. The danger tfiat might result from a diminution of the prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf was clearly realised, but the Foreign Office did not share the India Office’s view that this would be the inevitable consequence of the proposed action. ‘ l It might indeed be represented to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that Ibn Sand is the friend of the English, and has throughout his career (unlike certain lesser Arab rulers of no importance who are ignorant of world affairs) shown himself consistently well disposed to His Majesty’s Government and anxious in all circumstances to consult their interests, so that His Majesty s Government for their part have no hesitation in asking the sheikh to contribute his share towards an agreement which is considered to be advantageous to all parties. As for the objection raised by the Government of India, that there were political reasons against breaking the chain of territories under British control extending from Qatar to Muscat, the Service Departments concerned were understood to be satisfied that no strategic disadvantage would accrue from Saudi access to Khor-el-Odeid. Finally, a fixed frontier would have the effect of setting a limit to Saudi Arabian expansion. ( 2 ) See memorandum referred to in footnote ( 1 ). ( ■ q Owing to the attitude of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, See memorandum referred to in footnote (p.153 3 ctnu ixupeu LilcLL me secretary ot estate for Eon not to pursue the matter any further.' yj 6 rxovernment s own ■eign Affairs would agree was pointed out that not only were the proposals for a settlement of the frontier question justifiable on their own merits and in the interests of the Trucial Sheikhs, it was to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's advantage to have a definite frontier guaranteed throughout by His Majesty’s Government, even though that frontier embraced slightly less territory than an indefinite frontier of which only a small section was guaranteed by His Majesty’s Government. The Khor-el-Odeid was a small price to pay for this advantage. Moreover, some settlement of this long-out-standing question was most desirable from the point of view of Anglo-Saudi relations. 10 . To the argument employed by the India Office that Ibn Saud would be unlikely to respect a frontier line agreed upon between himself and His Majesty’s Government, since his policy in recent years had been to advance his spite of protests by His Majesty’s Government, it was argued that it was exactly the absence of a fixed frontier that had enabled Ibn Saud to extend his influence gradually over the territories of tribes which owed no allegiance to any other leader, and it was with the intention of arresting this process of encroachment that the Foreign Office had made proposals for a fixed frontier. If the frontier question remained unsettled, the process of encroachment would continue in such a way that Ibn Saud would probably eventually extend his rule over further territories till at length his domains would stretch to the shores of the Khor-el-Odeid. It was possible that, having regard to the general position in the Middle East and to the internationnal situation, His Majesty’s Government might not then be able to make more than a diplomatic protest to the Saudi Arabian Government, in which event the ultimate result would be infinitely more damaging to the prestige of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in the Persian Gulf area than the settlement proposed by the Foreign Office in the preceding July. Finally, emphasis was laid on the importance of retaining Ibn Saud’s goodwill (since, except for the question of Palestine, this frontier question was regarded by Ibn Saud as the only serious difficulty existing between himself and His Majesty’s Government) if only in the interests of ITis Majesty s Government’s own position in the Middle East in the event of an international emergency. If His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, wheneyei the question was raised on the Saudi Arabian side, showed that theii only wish was to Ipavp thp matter in abevance for an indefinite peiiod, while refusing to influence and his rule gradually and almost imperceptibly towards the coast in4 (1939). be in n q nr! from feel in a - resentment at the arbitral y manner e difficult to prevent Ibn Smid aI f(j i n the event of an international which his claims had been trea ^ Ma j esty ’s Government s enemies to emergency it would be all tne easiei igf ti of his territorial claims if m fiaLce Ibn Saud by a ^ dghip Great B ^^ n . he abandoned his traditional }»l ^ whole question might be discut d letter concluded with a suggesti office and the India Office at an orally between representatives oi the forei 0 informal meeting. suggestion and as a result of the divergence 11.

It was pointed out that, in this question, His Majesty’s Government stood m relation to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in two separate capacities—as the Power which was internationally responsible for his actions, and as the Power which was responsible to him only for the Khor-el-Odeid. The fact that His Majesty s Government told the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1906 that they regarded certain areas as lying in his territory did not constitute proof that that area did lie m his territory, or invalidate any claims which a third party— e.g., Saudi Arabia— might have to it; and if that party put forward these claims, His Majesty s Government in their capacity as the Power responsible for Abu Dhabi must, even out of merely neighbourly good feeling, take all responsible steps to reach a just settlement without regard to the difficulties in which their actions might involve them in their capacity as guarantor. In the second case, it was suggested that, if His Majesty’s Government could not grant Ibn Sand his request or even offer him a procedure by which he stood a chance of getting what he asked if he could make out any adequate case without breaking the pledge made to a neighbouring sheikh, His Majesty’s Government would have to find some method of compensating the sheikh in other directions. With regard to the nature of the pledge given in 1906 by His Majesty’s Government to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, it seemed to the Foreign Office to be clearly a pledge on the part of His Majesty’s Government to use their best endeavours to prevent the occupation by any other ruler of the area of undefined extent adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid. But the form of His Majesty’s Government’s endeavours would necessarily vary with the circumstances, and if, as a result of the employment of diplomatic methods, including, it might he, arbitration or mediation, the third party could make a justifiable claim to the area, it did not seem that His Majesty’s Government would remain under an obligation to resist by forcible methods the occupation of the area by the third party; His Majesty’s Govern ment could not do more for their client than they could do for themselves in similar circumstances, and it was suggested that the client similarly could not expect His Majesty’s Government to do more on his behalf than the intrinsic merits of his case permitted. It was also suggested that, if Ibn Baud wished to dispute the legal claim of the Sheikh of Abu Hhabi, and to claim that he was in law the owner of the territory, the 1906 pledge could not possibly mean that His Majesty s Government were bound to resist Ibn Baud by force and to refuse to submit the legal question to arbitration, which would be the normal course. If 18 Majesty s Government did so, it would be quite inconsistent with their continual pi of ess ions of attachment in principle to pacific settlement of inter- nfitronaJ disputes. In conclusion, the Foreign Office asked that the Sheikh of on Dhabi siiouId be warned that His Majesty’s Government might find it necessary to agree that the question of the frontier, including the section near \ oi-el-Odeid. should be submitted to some form of peaceful settlement, such asarbitration, and that, if this should prove to be the case, His Maiesty’s Govern CTentS 1 lef^Mm “ S i f“ I “ s to , the ut “ ost of their ability. If such arbitration eventually left him, as it certainly would, with a clearly-defined frontier which ^4t thtr^ldl^d f 611 10 res P ect ’, lt seemed t0 His Majesty’s Government f mplrt ill d f UCe T far m0r T stron g ] y t0 the security of his sheikhdom than . e piesent state of arfairs. It was, of course, added that, if the sheikh expressed strong- objection to any proposal of this nature, or asked whether any guarantee by His Majesty’s Government of his new frontier would be forth coming, me question would require further consideration. 13 The Tndia Office, on receipt of this letter, consulted all the local 01 l ties concerned, but although the Governor of Aden and the Resident at Mukalla were quite prepared to agree to the arbitration of the Saudi-Protectorate frontier it the question were decided on purely legal grounds, the India Office reply ot tne 10 th August stated that neither the Government of India nor the o itiCdl Resident in the Persian Gulf found it possible to support the proposed oner to submit the dispute to arbitration. The Government of India even felt considerable doubt whether an offer of arbitration would be welcome to Ibn Saud himself, and both they and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reiterated the argument that the mere suggestion to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that His s Government were contemplating arbitration in respect of territory which had been regarded as his possession for over sixty years would have a very damaging effect on His Majesty’s Government’s general prestige and influence m tne Persian Gulf; the Political Resident added the warning that the submission of the Khor-el-Odeid issue to arbitration would constitute a most dangerous precedent for the disposal of other claims to the territory of Persian Gulf rulers who enjoyed the protection of His Majesty’s Government. 14. Apart from the difficulties with regard to the choice of arbitrators, the terms of reference and the scope of the arbitration proceedings which were expounded in the Foreign Office letter, the India Office felt that, in the light of the opinion of the local authorities, His Majesty’s Government could not under take to solicit the consent of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. If the sheikh did agree to arbitration and the award went against him, he might well enquire what security he would have in the future against encroachments on the rest of his territory, since the mere fact that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to go back on their guarantee in respect of the Khor-el-Odeid showed that no reliance could be placed by him on any subsequent similar undertaking. 15. To arouse doubts of this nature with regard to His Majesty’s Govern ment’s good faith in the minds of the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf would, in the opinion of the India Office, be no less dangerous to our interests in the Middle East from the strategical point of view than the raising of dissatisfaction on the part of the Saudi Arabian Government should His Majesty’s Government maintain their previous attitude in the question of the frontiers, and, in view of the fact that Ibn Saud had not even made any reference to the matter in a letter which he had just addressed to the Prime Minister, the India Office could not believe that a refusal to meet Ibn Sand’s wishes would seriously prejudice Anglo- Saudi relations; they suggested that the question should be allowed to rest in the meantime, in the hope that the Saudi Arabian Goverument would be content not to raise the matter again. It was the India Office’s view that, if at some subsequent period it became necessary for His Majesty’s Government to give a definite answer, this should be to the effect that after the fullest consideration His Majesty’s Government regretted that undertakings to other rulers made it impossible for them to entertain the claim of the Saudi Arabian Government to territorial concessions in the Trueial Coast area. 16.

The last was described as the final offer, but the southern part of it was subsequently aiouified. The Saudi Arabian Government, however, have consistently adhered to the claims they put forward on April 3rd, 1935, to a frontier well in advance of any of these lines, But the last paragraph of memorandum A indicates that the frontier question was in abeyance ]qetween Kovegiber 1938 and the date of the memorandum; and so far as we know there have been no later developments, unless the rumours mentioned i n: Mr«.L ew i s ohn' s letter, which have also been reported by the Political Agent at Bahrein (see EXT, 1568/42) can be so described. 4. The Saudi claims advanced in April 1935 included the Jebel b&amp;khsh, which is a hill on the south western end of the Qatar peninsula forming part^of a larger range of low-lying hills called the *Jeb :1 Lukhan*. It lies north of the concession line which, as stated above, is regarded as equivalent to the Qatar frontier; but when^R a G agreed to this concessior. on Mayi 7 l 935 , they ha'd’not’ jet been informed of the Saudi claims out forward on TpfX r b P ?nX g - Ap R 1 3rd - IbE Saud ’ s ciaia to the'' naifhsh is discussed on page^ 5 ? of the m»r h a 3 ed 'Evf thft the contention onat he ha.s any right to it on the basis of the allegiance of the local tribes would be vigorously resisted by the Political authorities in the Gulf thTthfon iK P“rally recognised ’ E R-i noe ®“^°P majies it impossible for E./i.G. ,o aomit any such claira.

I have prepared a draft to the P. 0. consulting them on %inf^drsft reply to Mr Lewisohn, 11 seems probable that the F.O.will agree that it is undesirable that the Company should put up marks on the frontier, and that the Company will acquiesce in this view.

I also enclose a draft reply on which A I should be glad to have your comments. ® The statement that Ibn Saud has not raised with H.M.G.the question of his claim to the Jebel Nakhsh since 1938 is derived from the concluding paragraph of the memorandum / on ISon/South- easte^rcntier s of Saudi Arabia, of which you sent me a copy with your letter of February 18th last, No.E.2203/ 2203/25. I see that this memorandum is dated June 30th, 1940, and I should be glad if you would confirm my presumption that there have been no later develop ments which would make the statement' in our draft incorrect. For convenience I also enclose copies of our letters to the Company Kos.PZ,2795/39 of May 9th, 1939, and 2926/37 of May 18th, 1937, of which the former is referred to in the Company’s letter and the latter in our draft. The Company have in the past fully re- cognised that the Question of the frontier is a delicate one (see e.g, the note, copies of which were circulated under-3- our No, pz.4444/37, of a conversation which Clauson had with Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Jury loth, 1937, and the 4th paragraph of the Company's letter of January 30th, 1939 , copy of which was sent to the P.0.,undgr our No. PZ. 696/33) •lie therefore do not think that they will nuna be irg told not to set up marks along the frontier.

Packer, our Manager at Bahrain, mention is made of a rumour that the Shaikh of Qatar during his last visit to Mecca made some concession to the claims of Ibn Saud amounting to an agreement that the boundary between Qatar and Ibn Baud’s dominions should be a line running due East 'from Jebel Naksh. The fact that Ibn Saud had made some sort of claim to territory in this vicinity was referred to incidentally y Mr. Peel in his letter P.Z, 279 5/39 dated 9th May, 193,9^en the question of making^a landing ground for aeroplanes on - Qatar Peninsula was being discussed.

Their terms were not communicated at the time to Ibn Saud or to any other third party. Meanwhile, in May 1914. Ibn Sana himself concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Government, by which he was accorded the title of Vali of Nejd in return for an acknowledgment that he was an Ottoman subject and the servant of the Ottoman Government. No mention was made in the Conventions of the sovereignty of the territory to the east and south of the Blue and Violet lines, except that the Blue line was stated to separate the Ottoman Sanjak of Nejd from the territory of El Katr (Qatar). But it was clearly territory in which His Majesty’s Government were thereafter free, so far as the Ottoman Empire was concerned, to extend their influence and authority. 3. Ihe frontier question, which had, in its larger issues, lain dormant since e. 279 / 279 / 1914, was raised indirectly in November 1922, when Sir Percy Cox, the High 91 (1934). Commissioner in Mesopotamia, met Ibn Saud at Ojair in order to induce him to ratify the Treaty of Mohammerah of the 5th May, 1922, regulating frontier and other questions between Iraq and Nejd. The particular point involved was the boundaries of Qatar. Sir Percy had had no intention of entering upon a discussion of these boundaries, but he discovered that Ibn Saud proposed to grant to a body called the Eastern and General Syndicate a concession over an area including the whole of the Hasa Province of Nejd and the Qatar peninsula. The south-western and southern boundaries of this area were (according to a map produced at the meeting) to be a line drawn down the Wadi Faruk as far as Djau Dukhan (about latitude 24° North by longitude 49° East and not to be confused with Jebel Dukhan in the Qatar peninsula) and from there eastward to (9 The legal aspects of this question, and the policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to it, are discussed in a separate memorandum entitled “Ibn Sand’s Claims in respect of the South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia.” E 2203/2203/25 ; June 30, 1940 ; Confidential Number 15997.

At about the same time the United States Embassy at Angora enquired of His Majesty’s Embassy there the extent of the boundaries of Saudi Arabia, as the question had acquired importance to the American interests concerned in the oil concession. r . 5. Since Ibn Saud’s rise to power no special agreement had been concluded between him and His Majesty’s Government defining the boundaries of his territory in the east and south-east, and it was discovered that he had never been acquainted with the existence of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-14. It was decided, however, that, as the 1914 Convention, defining both the Blue and Violet lines, had been ratified, it was legally binding on Ibn Saud in his capacity of successor to the Ottoman Empire. The view was consequently taken at that time that, while the territories of the local Arab rulers under British protection in eastern and southern Arabia (i.e., the Trucial Sheikhs, of which the one with the largest nominal territory is the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and the rulers and tribes of the Aden Protectorate) did not necessarily extend westward and northward to the Blue and Violet lines, the area south and .east of those lines must be regarded as a British sphere of influence. Subsequently a reply to this effect couched in the least provocative terms possible was sent to the United States Embassy at Angora. It was considered advisable to inform the Saudi iMabian Government of the American enquiries, and a note addressed by His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda to the Saudi Arabian Government on the 28th April, 1934, gave the substance of His Majesty’s Government’s reply. 6. The United States Government apparently accepted the explanation and nothing further has been heard from them on the subject. But Ibn Saud refused, with some warmth, to accept the frontier laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Contentions as legally valid on the ground that the Ottoman Government had no right to dispose of his ancestral homeland. His reply was contained in a note dated the 13th May, 1934. from the Saudi Arabian Government. In this note the) refused tp admit that the 1913—14 Conventions had anv relevance, but expressed willingness to discuss the question further. A restatement of the British thesis m a note of the 15th June elicited a more reasoned statement of the Saudi case m a note ot the *20th June, in which it was argued that the Ottoman Government could have had no locus standi in the matter after Ibn Saud’s occupation ot Hasa on the 13th April. 1913. The Saudi Arabian Government further invoked the first Anglo-Saudi Treaty of the 29th December, 1915, by which His Majesty s Government had undertaken to recognize Ibn Saud’s sovereignty over the dominions of hts ancestors, and intimated that thev had\ 179 3 years previously established permanent settlements to the east of the northern end of the Blue line, whereas none of the Trueial Sheikhdoms on the coast of the Bersian bruit noi the Sultan of Muscat could possibly claim to exercise authority as far west as the Blue line. 8 . It was consequently decided to abandon a rigid adherence to the Anglo- e. 5858/2427/ Ottoman frontier, and the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs,( 3 ) Fuad 25(1934). Bey Hamza, was informed during his visit to London in September 1934 that His Majesty’s Government were prepared not to rest on the purely legal position, but to examine Ibn Sand’s claims in a generous spirit as part of a comprehensive settlement of all outstanding questions. It was not possible, however, to proceed further with the matter during these discussions, since Fuad Bey was unable to make any definite statement of Ibn Saud’s desiderata. In the meantime, His Majesty’s Government continued to seek a possible basis for a settlement, free from danger to their own interests or to those of their dependants in eastern Arabia, which might be proposed to the Saudi Arabian Government. 9. As a result of this further examination, instructions were sent to Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, early in 1935 (Foreign Office E 318/318/ telegram No. 8 of the 16th January, 1935) to pursue the following four stages in 25(1935). negotiation with the Saudi Arabian Government :— (i) To obtain a clear statement of Ibn Saud’s territorial claims to the east and south-east of the Blue and Violet lines. (ii) If these were not unreasonably vague or extensive, to offer, as part of a general settlement, to concede to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty a relatively small strip of territory immediately to the east of the Blue line. This strip would be bounded by a new line running from the head of the Dohat-as-Salwa to a point about five miles north-east of Sikak and from that point, in a direct line which would leave Banaiyan about five miles to the east, as far as the intersection of this line with parallel 20° North. The proposed boundary would run from this point of intersection in a south-westerly direction to a point, to be agreed later, on the Violet line. (The new line involved in this offer came to be called the “ Green line.”) (iii) If this offer failed to satisfy Ibn Saud, to propose the creation of a “ desert zone ” lying roughly between meridians 51 and 55 East, its northern and southern boundaries being drawn so as to leave a wide margin of territory in the hinterland to the Sheikhdoms of Qatar and Abu Dhabi (on the Trucial Coast) and the Aden Protectorate. This zone was to be subject for a fixed period of years to a special regime, under which neither Ibn Saud nor any other ruler would exercise any rights of territorial sovereignty (such as granting con cessions) ; but Ibn Saud would retain personal sovereignty over any of his tribes sojourning there. (iv) In that last resort, Ibn Saud might be granted the western part of the desert zone (i.e., west of meridian a2 Last) in full soveieignty. ( 3 ) The Minister for Foreign Affairs was and still is the Amir haisal, one of Ibn baud s sons,, but at that time his deputy did all the work.

These instructions formed part of a plan for a comprehensive settlement of all outstanding Anglo-Saudi questions but later this plan was found to be impracticable and was abandoned. In view of the importance oi the frontier question, however, His Majesty’s Government determined to pursue its settlement without reference to other problems in Anglo-Saudi relations. 11. The Saudi Arabian Government were therefore once more presses i the course of a private conversation between Fuad Bey and Sir A Kyan on the 21st January, 1935, to produce a precise statement of Ibn baud s desiderata. This request was subsequently renewed on the 1st Maich and a note containing the Saudi Arabian claims was eventually handed to Sir A. Ryan by I uad Bey Hamza on the 3rd April. The statement, though not clear on all points, made extensive demands. In the north Ibn Saud claimed as the boundary with Qatar a line starting from a point on the west coast of Qatar about fifteen miles north of Qasr-es-Salwa and running thence for a distance of about five miles in an easterly direction between the Jebel Nakhsh and the Jebel Dukhan, leaving the former to Saudi Arabia and the latter to Qatar. From there the line proceeded south-east and south for a distance of about twelve miles and then continued due east to a point on the coast of the Persian Gulf about seven miles north of the Khor-el- Odeid, thus leaving the latter in Saudi Arabia. The proposed boundary started again from a point on the Persian Gulf sixteen miles south of the Khor-el-Odeid and, after running to the south for a distance of about ten miles, turned east- south-east and followed a line curving slightly to the south until it reached the intersection of meridian 56° East and parallel 22 “ North. From there it followed meridian 56° East to parallel 19° North, and then ran in a straight line to the intersection of meridian 52° East and parallel 17° North, whence it continued along parallel 17° to the point of its intersection with the Violet line. 12. As the above demands (which were based on the areas frequented by certain tribes) seemed, extensive though they were, to be not unreasonable as an opening move in the negotiations, Sir A. Ryan proceeded forthwith to the second stage in the programme summarized in paragraph 9 above and offered the con cession described in sub-paragraph (ii) thereof. 13. No further important negotiations occurred until the problem was discussed with Fuad Bey Hamza in Eondon in June and July of the same year (1935). In the meanwhile, however, the whole question had been reconsidered by His Majesty’s Government as a result of a report received from the Resident at Aden in which it was pointed out that the tribes of the eastern Aden Protectorate exercised exclusive rights up to a line running from the intersection of meridian 55 East and parallel 20° North as far as the Violet line at the point of its intersection with parallel 18° North and that no Saudi tribes exercised any rights to the south oi that line. In view of this information it was agreed that the pi oposed desert zone was likely in the end to be too restricted in area to justify the complicated regime it would involve. Stages (iii) and (iv) in paragraph 9 abo\e were accordingly abandoned and replaced in His Majesty’s Government's programme by two further offers of territory in full sovereignty, viz. :— (a) a line running to a point at least five miles south-west of Banaiyan along t re line of the concession already offered (paragraph 9 (ii) above) and to th e intersection of meridian 52° East and parallel 22° 30' . ^ ’ fb enc e due south along meridian 52 c East to the point of its m ersec ion with parallel 19 North, and from there in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18° North with the Violet line (the boundaries of this proposed zone came to be called the “ Brown line ”), (5) the addition to vH of the area bounded by a line running from the inter- meHdb^^^^ 116 ! 2 ?n ^ ? ort - h an d meridian 52° East due east to zoo -p N ur t ^ eace ^ lle south to the intersection of meridian wLu W r 7u he P rolon ^ tio n in a straight line of the southern boundary of the concession offered ‘ (a) time it dpridAd fEof v&gt; as nope of its producing a settlement.

(Arabia) L Print: ^ Section 3 of areas where the inhabitants were subject to Saudi authority. In the north, in the neighbourhood of the Qatar peninsula, the political allegiance of actual settlements and recognized districts should be adopted as a guiding principle. In the desert aiea of the south, the proper method of delimiting the frontier would entail consideration of the most important factor in the desert namely the recognized grazing grounds or “ diras ” of the various nomadic tribes. He maintained that the statement of Ibn Saud's demands was formulated on the basis of the grazing grounds of four tribal groups which acknowledged Saudi sovereignty; in particular, of the widespread Murra tribe, and in support of the line claimed by Ibn Sand he communicated the names of 161 wells alleged e. 4314/77/91 to be owned by that tribe. Fuad Bey criticised the concessions offered by His (of Ju b 8 &gt; Majesty’s Government on the ground that they were purely arbitrary and not in 1935) ' accordance with the material facts of the situation in the desert.' The Saudi Arabian Government had, he said, worked out after the most careful investigation and enquiry a carefully plotted and rational boundary which took account of the political and tribal situation, and they were prepared to provide detailed evidence in support of their proposal. Hitherto His Majesty’s Government had merely replied to all Saudi proposals by a simple counter-offer of an arbitrarily limited and narrow area which failed to take account of the facts. In reply it was pointed out to Fuad Bey that there was a wide difference between the extreme limits of a tribe's wanderings (which would inevitably overlap with the limits of other tribes) and the actual territory within which a tribe was predominant. His Majesty’s Government had always been ready to recognize that territory in which a certain tribe w T as unquestionably the predominant influence belonged to that tribe, but it nevertheless seemed obvious that there would have to be a compromise between the extreme limits of the various tribal “ diras.” Furthermore, the question of allegiance was not always one which could be settled decisively. According to the information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government many of the tribes w r ere of uncertain and changing allegiance. There were, of course, certain areas which were predominantly or exclusively frequented by certain tribes owing a definite and exclusive allegiance to a particular ruler. His Majesty’s Government were prepared to take such considerations into full account in arriving at a settlement, and indeed had already done so in the formulation of their present proposals. But it seemed clear that a settlement could not be based on tribal considerations alone and that there existed other factors which should also be taken into account. 15. The discussions with Fuad Bey were necessarily inconclusive and productive of scant tangible result, beyond providing each side with a clearer knowledp’e of the basis of the other’s claims. It soon became apparent that thehalf tribes claimed by Ibn Saud, with particular ^ scmthern merit’s interest in the preservation of the existing position on the Trncial Coast, the reluctance of the Saudi Arabian Government to abandon their attitude was the direct cause of the complications which occurred in the succeeding months. 17 After long preliminary negotiations during the spring of 1935, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had on the 11th May addressed a note to the Sheikh of Qatar promising him British protection against attack on certain conditions, of which one was the grant to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company of a concession which was then under negotiation. This note did not indicate within what area this protection would be afforded, but His Majesty’s Government laid down for the guidance of their own representatives a “ protection line ” joining the top of the Dohat-as-Salwa to the coast immediately north of the Khor-el- Odeid. The concession was granted on the 17th May, 1935. It was accom panied by a map on which the southern boundaries of the concession area were shown by a line, later known as the “ concession line.” This line started from the Dohat-as-Salwa about 8 miles north of Qasr-as-Salwa, ran south- eastwards for about 12 miles, leaving the Jebel Nakhsh in Qatar and from /there eastwards to a point on the Persian Gulf about 8 miles north of the Khor- [el-Odeid. It has since been regarded as equivalent to the southern frontier of ' Qatar, although no attempt has been made to reach agreement about it with the 18. When news of the note reached Ibn Baud’s ears six weeks later he wrote direct to the Sheikh of Qatar on the 6th August, 1935, remonstrating with him for having granted, or intending to grant, an oil concession without waiting for some settlement of the question of the south-eastern frontiers. In the next month Sheikh Yusuf Yasin mentioned the matter to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda, and subsequently Mr. Calvert was instructed to take exception to Ibn Sand’s action in addressing the Sheikh on a matter concerning foreign affairs, and to defend the grant of the concession on the ground that the area lay in territory in which no rights of the Saudi Arabian Government could be admitted, for reasons which had been explained to Fuad Bey in July. He was also instructed to inform the Saudi Arabian Government that His Majesty’s Government had promised protection to the Sheikh against aggression, in particular of the oil concession area. Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda was also formally invoked. Mr. Calvert carried out his instructions in a letter addressed to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 26th September, 1935. The wording and inter- pretntion of this letter (which was, however, based strictly on the instructions of the Foreign Office) were the cause of considerable embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government m the course of 1938 (see paragraoh 59 belowY Sheikh. took with him entirely new instructions a great part of what he had originally7 demanded, subject to insistence on the attribution to Qatar of the whole of the mountains or hills (including the Jebel Nakhsh) composing its physical structure and to a refusal to entertain the Saudi demand for a boundary extending to the Persian Gulf east ol Qatar. Sir A. Ryan was instructed to emphasise to Ibn S ud that the present offer represented the utmost limits to which His Majesty’s ^rnment were prepared to go and that, indeed, they had only felt able to go tiius far on account of their strong desire to reach a final settlement; ami further that, while His Majesty’s Government had in no way abandoned their objections to basing the frontier solely on tribal considerations and were still strongly of the opinion that historical, geographical and strategic considerations must also be taken into account, their present offer in fact covered practically the whole “ dira ” of the Murra tribe (the most important of the three and a half tribes claimed by Ibn Baud), whose allegiance to him His Majesty’s Government were prepared in principle to recognise. 20. The boundary thus offered, which is known as the “ Riyadh line,” was defined as follows in a note handed to Fuad Bey at Riyadh on the 25th November, 1935, by Sir A. Ryan : (a) A line starting from a point on the eastern shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa Enclosure i in 4 miles to the north-east of the point where the sea is nearest to E ' 757 91 (i 935 ). Qasr-as-Salwa and- running in a straight line due south-eastwards for 10 miles (it was decided to indicate the terminal of this line as key-point A). (b) Thence the boundary would proceed in as straight a line as possible to a point (key-point B) midway between Haluwain and Nakhala, but drawn so as to leave Aqalat-al-Manasir, Farhad, Rimth, Khafur and the route between Doha and Abu Dhabi, which passes west of the Sabkhat-al-Amra, to Abu Dhabi, and Haluwain, Bil Deirish and Raghuwan to Saudi Arabia. (c) From this point (key-point B) the boundary was to proceed in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 23° north with meridian 52° east (key-point Cl; thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 22° 30' north and meridian 55° east (key-point F); and then along that meridian to its intersection with parallel 20° north (key-point G). (d) From there the boundary ran in an approximately straight line, but so as to leave the Sabkhat Mijora in baudi Arabia and the Ramlat Mugsnni in Muscat and Oman, to the intersection of meridian 52° east and parallel 19° north (key-point H) and thence m a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18° north with the Violet line of the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1914. 21. Sir A. Ryan, when making this offer, informed Fuad Bey that the sections between points G and H were under discussion wit ^ ^ Muscat and subject to his confirmation. He did, however h n t^k^tioif of He Bey that, subject to the Sultan’s views, it might be possibleHor this section of the line to be, drawn to include some territory lying to the east ot meridian 5o . th u. ^ new ofit™ rejected on the following day. the 26th November, mainly on account of the Saudi Arabian Government’s rel « c ‘*“ c « hji^that Vf Jebel Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid Fuad Bey, however more than hinted Hat,^it wS SSJSS iW&lt;l-Od.id „,d reduce b„ 23.

The claim to the Jebel Nakhsh also is based on the argument that the local tribes owe allegiance to Ibn Baud, but it is probable that toe real motive behind it is the desire to obtain an additional source of revenue—in recent years a very real and urgent necessity for the Saudi Government—since the Jebel as an oil-field. The legal justification for this claim does not appear to be any stronger than in the case of the Khor-el-Obeid, and topographically the Jebel Nakhsh should rightly belong to the Sheikh of Qatar. But the over-riding hindrance to a cession of the Jebel Nakhsh to the Saudi Arabian Government, which made it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to contemplate, was the circumstance that the Jebel Nakhsh was included in the concession which, with His Majesty’s Government’s full approval, had been granted in May 1935 to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by the Sheikh of Qatar (see paragraph 17 above) the approval of His Majesty’s Government having been given at a time when they had not received from Sir A. Ryan (though they did so very shortly afterwards) Ibn Sand’s proposal (see paragraph 11) showing that his claims extended as far as the Jebel Nakhsh. 26. In the early part of the year 1936 there was no further advance towards e. 606/152/ a settlement, and when Fuad Bey on the 3rd February made enquiries about the ' - problem His Majesty’s Minister discouraged him from hoping that FXis Maiesty s K 1 °^ 9 ] / ( 1936 ') Government could improve on the offer made at Riyadh (paragraph 20). 27. In the course of the conversations at Riyadh in 1935 Sir A. Ryan had restated the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the foreign affairs of the Trucial Sheikhs and the objections to Ibn Sand’s direct correspon dence with the Sheikh of Qatar. Fuad Bey did not contest the arguments, but advanced a new suggestion that a direct agreement between the Sheikh and Ibn Sand prior to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 vcas in existence and was therefore binding as the Sheikh must be held to have been a free agent before the date of the treaty. 28. This alleged agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and Ibn Sand led to a discussion lasting for several months during 1936. The Sheikh, challenged by the Political Agent at Bahrein, denied the assertion of Fuad Bey that there had been correspondence between him and Ibn Jiluwi, the Governor of Hasa. in which he had recognised Ibn Sand’s right to the Jebel Nakhsh. Fie could not even think of any correspondence into which such a meaning could be read, except that possibly (though about this he could not be certain^ Tbn Sand nr Jhn Jdnwi Nakhsh is about the only part of Qatar which is believed to have potential value9 tions^from His MaYest^rGovemmenrslrAZreTE, 1101 ? u f eSsf ^ 1 17 0n instruc ’ matter again before he left for Europe about a monih later Sheikh Yusuf YaJin Ibn Saud s private secretary (who acted for him in his absence) Droved to £ even more evasive, and eventuallv he informpri A T a P r ® ved to be said, consultation with Ibn Saud, that they did nofhsh to toh&amp;fr f ! 6 conversation with Fuad Bey about the agreement with Qatar Sir Andrew Rvan as^^iirrss!* w* s •ssJft Laviiroverboard To Saud threw Fuad Bey and the alleged agreement s AvA - ftftAtasr s d ss the exfstenc^of ^the jireYOl^agre^menl! 1 ^ end ° rSe hiS sta “'about • fl 29 ' ^t thls interview Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said that Ibn Saud had not m the past recognised any specific limits to the territories of the Persian Gulf rulers, though he always treated them in a liberal spirit. When the Ikhwan system was being organised he had directed the Ikhwan not to go into the Jebel Dukhan or the ^raiq (see paragraphs 40-41 below) in order that they should not incommode the Sheikh of Qatar. The conversation turned to the letter which Ibn Saud had written to the Sheikh of Qatar about the oil concession, and Sheikh lusut Yasin s attitude compelled Sir Andrew Ryan to repeat the warning that u the threat contained in Ibn Sand’s letter were carried out, His Maiesty’s Government would be bound to protect what they believed to be the territory of the Sheikh of Qatar. Sir Andrew Ryan also made His YUajesty’s Government’s attitude on the question of direct correspondence quite clear. The Saudi Arabian Government might think, contrary to the British view, that they were free to address the Sheikh of Qatar direct, but if the Sheikh received any communication from the Saudi Government, he was not merely free, but under an obligation, to inform His Majesty’s Government. 30. In October 1936 Petroleum Concessions, Limited, a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, informed the Foreign Office that the Ruba-al-Khali probably contained important oil resources, and that they would like to obtain from Ibn Saud a concession covering all the territory under his sovereignty east of meridian 48° up to such a boundary as might eventually be agreed upon between him and His Majesty’s Government. The Foreign Office pointed out that such an application might give Ibn Saud an exaggerated idea of the economic value of the area in dispute and make him even more intransigent in his dealings with His Majesty’s Government, and expressed the wish that the company should not approach Ibn Saud until the frontier negotiations had made some progress and, at any rate, not for another six months. 31. The frontier question was taken up with Fuad Bey later in the year, and on his return from a visit to Ibn Saud he expressed the following views to Sir Reader Bullard, who had by that time succeeded Sir A. Ryan: Any impression Sir A. Ryan might have had that the Saudi Arabian Government were prepared to compromise was due to a misunderstanding of his (Fuad Bey’s) ideas, which were that he should try to find some middle course to recommend to their Governments. He had no counter-proposals to make to the latest offer of His Majesty’s Government, since the southern boundary proposed by the Saudi Arabian Government was based on the essential needs of the tribes in that area. The British suggestion that the line along longitude 55° East might be moved eastwards was not of much interest to the Saudi Arabian Government, since the country in that region was desert. Fuad Bey appeared to be taking advantage of the change of Ministers when he suggested that His Majesty’s Government attached the greatest importance to the Khor-el-Odeid, but much less to the Jebel Nakhsh, which the Saudi Arabian Government regarded as most important. Sir R. Bullard held out no hope of any concession beyond that already mentioned, and could only promise to report to the Foreign Office. 32. Sir R. Bullard informed the Foreign Office that but for the complica tion introduced by the interests of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, in Qatar he [22284—1] c10 • f i, 0 „ 1 ,pot ion of the eastern and south-eastern would have been in favour were, he could only suggest- - frontiers in abeyance, but that a _ ■ order that the Saudi Arabian (1) that Fuad Bey sh( f ^ J^er’ no illusion on this point, that His Government might remain unJ ^ ^ Jebel Nakh sh and the Majesty’s Government g hould be aske d on what other tj Khor-el-Odeid as es^ntial, but h Majesty’s Minister could ^jS ^ofats^r- ^eal to their respective Governments; nnmidered whether His Majesty’s Govern- (2) that m f n ^ le X r S d h to offer further slight concessions on the borders of Muscat and the Aden Prot ® Ct ^ t ^ ifficulties inherent in this second sr pis-ri ‘sss.rst ssz —-—- b &gt;- ih - - of Petroleum Concessions, Limited R Bullard was instructed on the 33.

Minister. After a study of the evidence in Mr. Bertram Thomas s A mbui Sir R. Bullard wrote to Fuad Bey on the 12th February explaining that the evidence seemed to show— ^ , (1) That all four wells were in the steppe country which slopes from tfte coastal mountains to the sand; , , i (2) That the tribes within that belt were all tribes to which Ibn baud maue no claim; (3) That the Murra do not come as far south as these four wells. 35. So far as the Saudi Arabian Government were concerned, the only other development in the south-eastern frontier question during 1937 was PJ 0V hj ec \ | the discussions which took place in the course of the visit made by Mr. Kencie , the head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office, to Saudi Arabia during the early months of the year. 36. Mr. Kendel, on his way to Jedda by way of Bahrein, visited the Oatar peninsula with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in a Royal Air h°rce aeroplane. He made a sketch map of the whole Jehel Dukhan, of which the Jobe Nakhsh was found to be clearly an integral part, and on his arrival at Sir R. Bullard and he, in the course of prolonged discussions, showed the map to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Arabian Minister in London. Air. Rendel described the terrain fully, but althougb he dwelt on the fact that the Jebel Nakhsh formed an integral part of the Jebel Dukhan, and the Jebel Dukhan of the Qatar peninsula, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin reiterated the old argument based on tribes : that all the tribes in that area owed their allegiance to Ibn Saud, who might, he added, have put forward far wider claims than he had11 actually done, but that Ibn Baud H* t i i i , , abandon the rest of his claim in that coL te^Ilf 1? ^ g i Ven him &gt; would of the peninsula must be maintained Ind !?ro.„a i-b ? endel said tha t the integrity cl a 7 to the Jebel Nakhsh bad “put forward tha? the inept at an advanced stage and had come ■ ,« 7 ™ 7, 16 Saudl Arabian Govern- Go nment, it was not worth imperdHng a seTuement 1° U ^ st fs its account.

In any case, it was impossible for His Majesty s Government to go back on their undertaking of 38 Finally, the conversation turned to a locality called the Safaq wells which he on the caravan route from the Trucial coast to Qatar and Hasa at about longitude 52 East, and Mr. Rendel indicated that there was some hope that a concession might be made in that quarter. If, as he believed, the wells were much nearer the coast than appeared from the published maps, the Saudi frontier could be moved further towards the coast, on condition that Safaq itself and the caravan route remained in Abu Dhabi. But he could not admit the Saudi argument that Safaq was a Murra well. 39. In point of fact, a few days later information was received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, based on investigations made by the Royal Air Force, that Safaq was as much as three times nearer the coast than appeared on even the latest maps. 40. Mr. Rendel made a personal appeal to Ibn Saud for a settlement of the question at his third interview^ with him on the 21st March, 1937, and urged e. that, as His Majesty’s Government had made great concessions, Ibn Saud might make some concession in this quarter; to which Ibn Saud repeated the long standing argument that the whole of the coast had belonged to his ancestors and that the present rulers could not deny it. There was a limit beyond which he would not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik, but unfortunately this place did not appear on the accessible maps. Sir R. Bullard interposed that he believed it to lie south of the Jebel Nakhsh, and that, if this were so, there would no longer be any difference of opinion. As regards the Khor- el-Odeid, Ibn Saud advanced the argument that in claiming it for Saudi Arabia he had the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much at heart as his own, since no one, he alleged, but himself could maintain order there and when crimes were committed it was to him that the injured parties applied for redress. 41. Immediately after this interview Sir R. Bullard wrote to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin stating that, on a map in the possession of His Majesty s Legation at Jedda, Araik was situated between Qasr-as-Salwa and the Jebel Nakhsh and enquiring whether Ibn Saud’s definition did not on this basis leave the Jebel Nakhsh to Qatar. Ibn Saud’s reply, as transmitted by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, was to the effect that he was not referring to the “ Araik of Nakhsh ” but to the one lying south of Dukhan,” and that therefore the Jebel Nakhsh lay within Saudi Arabia, and that, anyhow, his statement was incidental and did not concern the details of the case. At the same time Sheikh Yusuf Yasin sent a protest from Ibn Saud against the policy of encirclement which he claimed His Majesty s Government were pursuing against him (a reference to His Majesty s Govern ment’s policy towards the Arab Sheikhdoms in the P^sian Gulf) 42. In reporting on these discussions, Sir R. Bullard urged that it was e. undesirable at that moment to endeavour to force a settlement. If, at the time ^ of Mr. Rendel’s visit, it had been possible to arrange for a settlement o e [22284—1] C 2 1961/92/ 25 (1937). 1705/258/ 91 (1937). 2124/258/ 91 (1937).1 12 , ri^irahle but the frontier question was whole question, it would have b ® en T P Saud and in these circumstances, and on evidently a cause of annoyanceJ,o^ ^ re iy geographical aspects of the account of the difference of ^ would be to endanger akhsh area, to conversations.

Sir R Bullafd urged therefore that, in order not to let the ^miyfaimsgoby default a special joint commission should be sent to examine Jn, purely Graphical'features of the Jebel Nakhsh area. At the same time he urged that Hi?Majesty’s Government should consider giving Ibn Sand a royalty on any oil which might be found in or near the Jebel Nakhsh, on the pretext that the oil-bearing strata must run partly under his territory (though a similar plan had been found impracticable when Iraq had endeavoured to buy oft ftiiKish intransigence about Mosul). Finally, he pointed out the strain that would be placed on Ibn Saud if the search for oil and minerals m Saudi Arabia continued to be unsuccessful, while oil were found, as in the case of Bahrein, in the territory of some completely unimportant ruler like the Sheikh of Qatar. e. 2124 / 258 / 43 . On the 7th May, 1937, the Foreign Office replied that, while the 91(1937) - undesirability of pressing Ibn Saud for a decision was appreciated, an undeter mined frontier must, in their opinion, constitute a continual source of danger and uncertainty, particularly since Petroleum Development (Qatar), Limited (a subsidiary of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, to whom the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had transferred their Qatar rights on the 5th February, 1937), were hoping to begin prospecting in the south-western area of the Qatar peninsula. If nothing were done to effect at least a crystallization of the frontier on lines which appeared reasonable to His Majesty’s Government, and therefore to fulfil their obligations to the Arab States on the Trucial Coast, it was always possible that Ibn Saud would continue to pursue his former tactics and seek to extend his influence, thereby rendering the possibility of effecting a territorial settlement increasingly remote, particularly if Anglo-Saudi relations deteriorated as a result of the imminent publication of the Report of the Royal Commission on Palestine. In the circumstances His Majesty’s Minister was asked whether he advocated a unilateral declaration by His Majesty’s Government, to be treated, if necessary, as confidential, defining the line which they regarded as the boundary. It was suggested that this might be done in an amicably phrased note explaining that, though His Majesty’s Government appreciated the reasons for Ibn Baud’s unwillingness to commit himself at this juncture, it was impossible for His Majesty s Government to allow the question to continue in its present indeter minate ^state. It was intended that the note, after defining the northern sector °y ^ ne frontier on the lines of the Riyadh proposals, modified to take account of the newly defined position of Safaq, should explain that His Majesty’s Govern- ment did not intend to claim territory either for themselves or for the Arab kAeikhs in the Fersian Gulf beyond that line; they proposed to treat the territorv on the Qatar and Abu Dhabi side of the line as either under the control of His rSfw - 8 T\T Yer . n ™ e n t or the suz , eramt y of the Arab rulers concerned; finally, . e • ; '' V a J®? y s ovemment desired to record their position in this question »te&amp;2r » ita *«* menCof ondrosoS ’ 8 ^ WaS that the P 08 ^^ of an early commenee- suwested that in order f' 1 ® U S 0 l /j) 3 u ?t , fy the proposed communication, but Zsf favourable relit rt the pl11 ’ U was ™Portant first to return the most favourable reply possible to a recent request of Ibn Sand’s for arms either 1 that h“ uJtltTcflA^ — in m9 atd sa'n| payment for the arms supplied tte^o^hse^eUe^stflCt^^tt ^ pl ' esent ', f f overlook the question of eventual ravmentN t’d k 1 ' th 4 tlle y proposed to about Ibn Sand’s complaints of Ms Maiestv^s Or v 6n * S ?&gt; ld a sympathetic note ment,” in which an offer should be mm ftls^ ^V - 8 ^ of enclr cle- His Majesty might care to niooini that d re P resen tative whom Jebel Dukhan.

The Foreign Office was, however, inclined to favour R. Bullard s suggestion of a communication to Ibn Saud on the subject of a survey of the disputed area, which might tahe the form of a rough topographical enquiry into the geographical features of the area followed by the submission of a report, though it was envisaged that it would be necessary to insist on the inclusion of a representative of the Sheikh of Qatar in the survey party Sir R. Bullard was authorised to speak to Ibn Saud or else to postpone the question till later, when it might be possible to put forward more detailed proposals. In virtue of these discretionary powers Sir R. Bullard, who was about to depart for Riyadh when the telegram arrived, decided to leave the matter until later, partly because all that he and, as it happened, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had had in mind was quite a short visit to the area in question in order that the Saudi representative might, with the evidence of his own eyes, see that the British contentions were correct and that the Jebel Nakhsh did, in fact, form part of the Jebel Dukhan. 46. Meanwhile, the Government of Aden were asked by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to consider whether some additional concession might not be made in the area between parallels 17° and 18°, particularly to the west of meridian 51°. The Secretary of State considered it desirable to examine the question from the point of view of the limits of the area over which Aden tribes had indubitable claims, rather than with the intention of excluding Ibn Saud from those districts of which the ownership was completely indeterminate. The Aden Government—although they expressed the hope that a smaller concession would be made—considered that the utmost concession which could be considered politically wise would be the cession to Saudi Arabia of an additional strip of territory by redrawing the frontier from the intersection of the Violet line with meridian 48° to a point on meridian 52°, 20 miles south of parallel 19°. This proposal received the concurrence of the Colonial Office, but His Majesty’s Minister was of the opinion that a strip of desert 20 miles wide by 300 long would not possess much value as a counter in the game, since Ibn Saud apparently attached no great importance to that part of the frontier at that moment. Sir R. Bullard further believed that, in view of the opinion expressed by the Governor of Aden, His Majesty’s Government should try to avoid making the suggested sacrifice, although, if a unilateral declaration were to be made with regard to the frontier of Qatar, he thought they should be prepared to leave to Ibn Saud the whole of the strip in question. On the 1st July the Foreign Office telegraphed to Jedda that the view of Flis Majesty s Government was that the balance of advantage lay in leaving the question of the southern^ section in abeyance for the present time. In conveying this decision to the Goveinor or Aden, the Colonial Office pointed out that the present policy of establishing British authority more firmly in the interior of the Protectorate wou d, .y facilitating the acquisition of more detailed knowledge on the region strengtaen His Majesty’s Government’s position for a subsequent statement of their claim 47. The Saudi Arabian-Muscat frontier, though it also was reviewed during the year 1937, was not discussed in Jedda, but formed the subject of coiisioerable correspondence between the Political Agent at Muscat and the Sultan The Sultan showed himself reluctant to define the western limits of his y. had never been done before. The possibility that tneie concessions had—it was believed—made the i-U-tan even m ,P . . . a would have been expected. However, in a letter f h d y® &amp; yL^Jkn.dfno obittMn on the 11th May, 1937, the Sultan fina ly stated that he ra . 1 p s ® if the eastern limits of the territory belonging to Ibn Sa ' d Vf • A by of the based on the following points (see those selected for the definition of the “ Riyadh ” line, paragraph 20) : C. The intersection of 52 D. The intersection of 54 E. The intersection of 55° 40 E. and 22 N. G. The intersection of 55° E. and 20 JN. H. The intersection of 52 E. and 23° N. 40' E. and 22' E. and 19° N. 40' N. E. 3612/258/ 91 (1937).

Apparently Ibn Saud has long had some shadowy claim to Baraimi, but it lies so far outside the extreme limit of the eastern frontier which he has claimed in the course of the negotiations during the last few years that it would be difficult for him to put forward a territorial claim to the oasis now. On the other hand, Baraimi seemed to be in the most promising area for oil in any territory adjacent to the Trucial Coast, and, if oil were actually to be discovered in the oasis and boring to begin, there would be strong temptation for Ibn Saud to put forward some kind of claim based on some shadowy show of right, such as visits which are reported occasionally by his officials to gather tribute. He would be helped in this by the fact that the authority of other rulers over the tribes of the oasis (both the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi have claims in this respect) seem to be af an uncertain kind. 50. The question of the Jebel Nakhsh, which had lapsed for several months, revived when news was received in the autumn that the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company, who hold the concession on the Saudi side of the frontier, were showing activity in the neighbourhood of Qasr-al-Salwa, and the moment for making a decision seemed to have arrived. On the 29th November, E 690 m 1937, further instructions were sent to Jedda, which formed the basis of a note m (1937 ). Jl 1 * ™ J H TT * IV /T * &gt; T i. * j_ j T. i * A 1 * r* Affairs. The most important passage of this note was as follows :— ' I have the honour to inform Your Royal Highness that, according to recent reports which have reached His Majesty’s Government, it appears that the Standard Oil Company of California, are prospecting in the neigh bourhood of Qasr-al-Salwa. The views of His Majesty’s Government wdth regard to the frontier in the said area have already been communicated to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and His Majesty’s Government are prepared to reopen negotiations for a settlement on the lines they have indicated. They assume that in the meantime no attempt will be made by the Californian Arabian Company to pass the line defined in the latest proposals b\ His Majesty s Government to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, so long as no final agicement has been reached as to that line. Since, however, there is some uncertainty as to the precise position of certain physical features concerned His Majesty’s Government propose that a joint Anglo-Saudi topogiaphical mission should be appointed to establish on the spot the exact nature and position of these features.” delivered by His Majesty’s Legation to the Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign15 185 un me question mignt De denned as follows : - E. 7656/258/ 91 (1937). (1) That until a final settlement was reached over the disputed area no oil ' company lepiesentatives from the Saudi side of the frontier would enter the area, provided that a similar assurance was given by the oil company which was operating in the Arab States on the Persian Gulf. (2) That the Saudi Arabian Government had always been ready to conclude an agreement, and that the obstacle had been the unwillingness of His Majesty’s Government to recognise officially what territory was in reality in the possession and under the influence of Ibn Saud; they therefore enquired whether— (3) His Majesty’s Government did not agree that it was preferable to define the frontier in principle first ‘ c by specifying either places or co-ordinates.” 52. In his report on the Saudi Arabian attitude, Sir P. Bullard stated that e. 7656/258/ Ibn Saud clung as tenaciously as ever to the Jebel Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid as 91 (1937). well as to Safaq, actuated as he was by considerations of prestige, poverty and the possibility of oil. He added that reports from the Persian Gulf Residency on the Legation file showed that, in point of fact, it was Ibn Saud who administered at least the first two of the places in dispute. Nevertheless, he was well aware that the history of the case went very much further back than the time of Ibn Saud, and that settlement on a purely tribal basis was out of the question. He did, however, want to avoid forcing an issue to the question at a time when European affairs loomed so large in international relations, and he thought it would be worth while to await some amelioration of the international situation before undertaking further oil prospecting in neutral areas. 53. Meanwhile, on the 22nd December, 1937, His Majesty’s Government had decided that various proposals should be considered “ for securing the good will of Ibn Saud ” in order to counteract, as far as possible, the inevitable ill effects on the Arab world of His Majesty’s Government’s policy in Palestine. In this connexion the suggestion was advanced that Ibn Saud might be given the Jebel Nakhsh and an outlet on the Khor-el-Odeid, and that compensation should be paid to the Arab rulers at whose expense these concessions would be made. 54. As a result of this decision and in an endeavour to meet the Saudi point of view as stated in (1) of paragraph 51, it was decided to ascertain whether the Petroleum Concessions, Limited, would, in fact, be willing to help His Majesty s Government in this matter. Early in January 1938, a memorandum giving a E. 410^50/ historical survey of the position and an explanation of the motives whicn led His Majesty’s Government to grant full approval to the Anglo-Iranian Oil - . y_ q Company concession secured in May 1935 from the Sheikh of Qatar was com municated privately and confidentially to Lord Cadman. It was explained that at that time nothing was known of Ibn Saud s claims, and the possibility that he J would ever seriously lay claim to territory as far east of the Blue line as the , Jebel Nakhsh seemed so remote as to be almost negligible. The concession was therefore approved by His Majesty s Government without misgiving. Its terms were never communicated to the Saudi Arabian Government, although they protested against its conclusion at the time, and from later indications it j16 i irnuression thcit it did not mclndG appeared that they may have h P j arisen as the result of a the Jebel Naktet-a mis^rs^d^ charg6 d’Affaires at letter addressed to Sheikh ^ui . ^ «, th concession does not extend to Jedda in September 1935, which stated that ^ - (se e paragraphs 18 any territory under discussion with the Saudi ^ ^ ^ the ^ , above and 59 below).

Lord Cadman made it clear m his reply that be was strongly opposed to any concession on this point and, as a result, it was decided to abandon the question of any cession in the Jebel Nakhsh, and to concentrate attention on the possibility of making some concession over the Khor-el-Odeid. 56. As a result of this decision consideration of the question of some cession in the Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud was renewed. According to views expressed on behalf of the Service Departments at this time, there was no objection on grounds of strategy to the cession of the Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Sand, or substance in the view that it was strategically important to have an unbroken line of British- controlled States along the Persian Gulf. Finally, it was decided early in 1938 to ascertain the views of His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, the Government of India, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the proposal to cede the area adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid. 57. Meanwhile, the controversy in its local aspect, which was already acute enough at the end of 1937, was further envenomed in 1938 as the result of two unfortunate incidents : an indiscretion on the part of the Jedda representative of the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company, as a consequence of which Ibn Sand learned that His Majesty’s Government had been in direct communica tion with the company about the frontier question; and the discovery that Ibn Saud had misread, or at any rate misinterpreted, the letter sent to Fuad Bey Hamza by Mr. Calvert in September 1935 (see paragraph 18). 58. As stated in paragraph 50, the Jedda representative of the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company, Mr. Lenahan, had been informed of the proposal to appoint a joint Anglo-Saudi frontier commission by His Majesty’s Minister, and warned of the line beyond which His Majesty’s Government considered no company ho] ding a Saudi concession had a right to go In a subsequent conversation with Fuad Bey, Mr. Lenahan most indiscreetly alluded i l- mforma , Tlon ’ whereupon the Saudi Arabian Government on the LnosnurTt'' 7 nu ' t a P, Iotesl y Majesty's Legation against communications rXL7o7r Hy 5 .Majesty s Minister or the Foreign Office and local repre- thev nointpH ont^ 3 •* P™, 1 ® 11 . ^yabum Standard Oil Company in a manner which, they pointed out, might be interpreted as implying the existence of doubts and suspicions about the attitude of Ibn Saud.

At the time it seemed possible that Fuad Bey hTd unearthed this matter in order further to delay and confuse the question, but this theory was discounted by his obvious consternation when His Maiesty’s Minister explained to him the real significance of the sentence in Mr. Calvert’s letter. It is true that the letter, which was copied word for word from the instructions sent from the Foreign Office, might have been less ambiguous, and it is unfortunate that it reached the Saudi Arabian Government when Fuad Bey was not in charge of the Ministry. But m spite of the explanations, the harm was done, it appeals that Ibn Saud was annoyed and that some suspicion of British good faith subsequently remained for a considerable time in his mind 61. It was stated at the end of paragraph 52 that Sir R. Bullard had advocated an agreement for the postponement of any oil prospecting in the disputed areas pending an amelioration of the international situation, but that the Foreign Office were unable to approve his proposal on the ground that to accept the Saudi suggestion would be virtually to concede the Saudi case. It was therefore necessary for Sir R. Bullard, in replying to the Saudi Arabian Government in January 1938, to refer to the merely oral statement made -by Fuad Bey that there was no cause to fear that the company would prospect in the afeas under dispute, and to ignore the Saudi note proposing mutual abstention from operations in that quarter. The Saudi Arabian Government refused to go beyond their written proposals, and although they failed to elicit any satisfactory reply from His Majesty’s Government, the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company did not, in fact, take any action thereafter, as far as was known to His Majesty’s Government, in the area under dispute. 62. It was, therefore, with the intention of preventing an endless exchange of tu quoque arguments, and in view of the proposed modification of policy with regard to the Khor-el-Odeid, that early in March 1938 Sir R. Bullard appealed to Fuad Bey, who was about to go on leave, to make some attempt to get out of the impasse, and suggested that Fuad Bey should give his personal opinion as to the nature of the solution which he thought might conceivably prove acceptable to the Saudi Arabian Government, promising that he himself would ponder the matter and give his personal views on the possibility of its acceptance by His Majesty’s Government. In this way neither Government would be irrevocably committed, and a solution might be found. Fuad Bey, aftei a delay of several days, ostensibly for ££ reflection,” during which he had doubtless ascertained Ibn Saud’s reactions to the proposal, advanced a suggestion in which he fiist all but insisted on the retention of the Jebel Nakhsh, but finally proposed, as a plan which might have some hope of acceptance by Ibn Saud, that His Maiesty’s Government should offer to abandon to Ibn Saud whichever of the two areas, the Jebel Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid, they considered the less important and that the line demarcating the nontiei should pass through the Safaq wells in such a way as to make them free of access to the population on both sides of ths frontier. 63.

His Majesty’s Government had acted in accordance with this practice in cases where important oil companies, whether of the same or of different nationalities, were operating in adjoining areas, and they regretted that the Saudi Arabian Government should take exception to a normal procedure designed to ensure the maintenance of good relations between the great oil companies and the countries in which they were registered. 65. In November 1938, when His Majesty’s Minister was at Riyadh. Fuad Bey interrogated him about the frontier question, and, emphasising the importance that attached to the question in Ibn Sand’s eyes, asked whether Sir R. Bullard was able to make some reply to the proposals which he had put forward in the spring. But as His Majesty’s Government had not been able to reach any agreement about the proposed cession of the Khor-el-Odeid owing to the existing rights of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, which it was suggested could not be disregarded even ii the sheikh were offered compensation in other directions, Sir R. Bullard was not, in the circumstances, able to give an encouraging reply to this question. 66. Since Fuad Bey’s conversation with Sir R. Bullard in November 1938 the Saudi Arabian Government have not raised the question again and it may apparently be considered to be in abeyance. No mention of it was made in Ibii Sand s letter to the Prime Minister which the Emir Feisal brought with him when he came to London for the Palestine Conferences early in 1939 nor d’d the Lmir bimseh mention the differences of opinion between His Majesty’s Govern rnent ana the Saudi Arabian Government on this question in the course of interviews with the Secretary of State and Sir L. Oliphant. Activity during this year was confined to an inconclusive exchange of views between the Fore en Office and the India Office in continuation of the attempt to discover some aS basis for the final settlement of the question of the south .eastern from During the first six months of 1940 there were no developments at aH iers. Eastern Department, June 30. 1940.2 0 The Doliev of His Majesty’s Government in this question, has since 'ef in W Mr. tcK S/lnd ^ n^iaS bS a-^'s-KtS” yf-i; = ■ - necessary to assert in public or in a negotiation that, pending such a settl. nt, the Blue and Miolct lines form the le^ul frontici. , . , . , “On a strict view of the legal position, it follows from what has been said in paragraph 4 that any territories to the east of the Blue line to which none of the local Arab rulers have an effective title may proper y he acquired by Tbn Sand. On the other hand, where a local sheikh can put ioi waul leasonable claim to a piece of territory such territory may be deemed to be lega ; v his, since, in virtue of the 1914 Convention, Ibn Sand cannot nase any claims to territory beyond the Blue line on the state of affairs existing befoie 1914. He can only base them on actual possession acquired ana exeicised since that date. 7 ^ The position of the local sheikhs as thus stated is further reinforced by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 (see Command Paper 2951), whereby Thn Sand nndertorkt— “ To maintain friendly and peaceful relations with Koweit and Bahrein, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman coast [?'.£•, the Trucial Sheikhs], who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Maj esty ’ s Government. 8. It is the view of His Majesty’s Government that, by recognising their special treaty relations with the local Arab States, Ibn Sand committed himself to the acceptance of the existing boundaries of those States. But here a new difficulty arises owing to the fact that, in most cases, these boundaries have never been clearly defined. The question is, whether the sheikhs are legally entitled to those territories which, though never clearly defined, have been commonly regarded in the past as falling within their dominions, even when they have in fact had no proper claim to those territories and have never exercised any effective authority over them. If the tribes which inhabit those territories now recognise the authority of Ibn Sand, the further question arises whether the Saudi Arabian Government are precluded from putting forward a claim by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda. It is difficult to show that they are so precluded. 9. The Saudi Arabian Government do not, it must be said, accept even the moderate view of the legal position described in paragraph 4. In the first place they deny that they are bound by the 1914 Convention at all. They maintain that this convention was concluded without the knowledge or consent of Ibn Sand, who had, by the time the two conventions were signed, succeeded in expelling all traces of Ottoman control or influence from the territories adjoining the Blue and Violet lines on the west and north, with a Power which His Majesty’s Government themselves recognised during the Great War to be a usurper and an oppressor of the Arab race. Since, however, Ibn Sand himself later in 1914 concluded a treaty formally recognising his dependence on the Ottoman Government, the Saudi contention would seem to have little real justification, and there can be little doubt that the 1914 Convention is, in fact, legally binding on Ibn Sand in his capacity of successor to the Ottoman Government (see paragraph 4 (ii) and (iii) above). 10. Secondly, the Saudi Arabian Government contend that article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda did not commit them to recognise any given frontiers claimed by the Arab sheikhs, a fortiori in cases where those frontiers had never been clearly defined. This argument has considerably more force than the one mentioned above, since a modification of the frontiers of Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms need not affect the special relations of His Majesty’s Government with those States. But at least it appears justifiable to maintain that article 6 ol the treaty of Jedda committed the Saudi Arabian Government to recognising the sovereignty of the Arab rulers over territories which had previously formed the subject of special agreements with His Majesty’s Government, 'and had been recognised by the latter in or before 1927 as falling within the dominions of those rulers. As will be seen later, this point is particularly relevant in the case of the Saudi claim to the territory adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid In other cases the varying interpretations given to article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda byI to the E. 4734/279/ to any 91 (1934). i 12. The ££ tribal” claims, however, need to be examined more closely, since I they are leaily the basis of the whole Saudi case. Briefly, the view put forward I by the Saudi Arabian Government is that, since much of the territory adjoining the Persian Gulf to the east of the Blue line is under no regular rule, the status of any part of that territory must be determined solely on the basis of tribal allegiances. This view has not been accepted unreservedly by His Majesty’s Government, who have pointed out on more than one occasion (e.q., at the meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 24th June, 1935; see Eastern (Arabia) Print of e. 3944/77/ the 25th June, 1935, Section 3) that, since many Arabian tribes are accustomed 91 (1935). to wander over a very wide area, it would be impossible to base territorial claims on the extent of those wanderings, or to establish a frontier line solely in accordance with fluctuating tribal allegiances; and further that a simple allo cation of tribal areas could not, as the Saudi Arabian Government are sometimes inclined to maintain, replace a territorial frontier. Subject to these reservations, however, it follows from what has already been said earlier in this memorandum that it is justifiable for the Saudi Arabian Government to contend that where a given area is inhabited by tribes the majority of which acknowledge their allegiance to Ibn Sand, and no other ruler has any effective claim to that territory, it may rightfully be claimed by the Saudi Arabian Government. 13. Moreover, it seems justifiable to contend, as the Saudi Arabian Govern ment do, that in the absence of other indications the payment of ££ zakat ” (a form of tribute or tax) may be regarded as the factor determining the allegiance of a particular tribe. The question to what extent it is admissible to invoke the payment of tribute as evidence of sovereignty has already formed the subject of exhaustive discussion. In his demi-official letter No. C/151 of the 30th March, e. 2332 / 279 / 1934, Sir T. Fowle maintained, with regard to payments made by certain Arab sheikhs, including the Sheikh of Qatar, to Ibn Sand, that these payments could in no way be regarded as formal tribute, or as constituting a recognition of Ibn Saud as the overlord of the payers. The observations of Sir T. Fowle referred, however, only to payments made to Ibn Saud by the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Trucial States, whose independence of Saudi Arabia was in any case safeguarded by the special engagements existing between them and His Majesty’s Government, which were recognised by the Saudi Arabian Government under article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda. Clearly there could be no question of these payments having involved in any way a recognition of Ibn Saud’s overlordship. 14. In the case of ££ zakat ” payments made by local tribal chiefs inhabiting territory to which no one has a legal claim and over which no ruler exercises any effective authority, the position is, however, somewhat different, since the status of those chiefs is nowhere established by treaty and may therefore be taken to depend on the degree of allegiance given by them to one or other of the recognised local rulers. Thus there would seem to be some force in the argument that in such cases the levy of ££ zakat,” whether it is called ££ blackmail ” or by some other name, may be regarded as taxation and consequently as providing evidence of [22284—2] b 24 * E, 4734/279/ 91 (1934).

Having established this principle m judging the Saudi case, it seems appropriate to consider briefly the mam claims hitherto out forward by the Saudi Arabian Government, their claims to the territory^dioining the Khor-el-Odeid, an inlet of the Persian Gulf to the south east of the Qatar peninsula, and to the Jebel Nakhsh, a mountain area to the south-west of the Qatar peninsula, claims to which the present deadlock m the frontier negotiations is mainly attributable, as well as Lie claims advanced by them in regard to the other sections of the frontier. (B)— The Saudi Claim to the Khor-el-Odeid. E. 212412581 91 (1934). E. 2180/279/ 91 (1934). E. 1513/81/ 91 (1934). E. 7615/279/ 91 (1934). 16. This is based (a) on historical arguments, and (b) on tribal allegiances 17. An effective refutation of (a) was contained in the note given to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin by Mr. Rendel after the conversation recorded in the enclosure to Jedda despatch No. 47 of the 20th March, 1937 (Eastern (Arabia) Print of the 19th April, 1937, Section 1). x\s stated already, the historical arguments put forward by the Saudi Arabian Government have not much force. 18. As regards (b), the Saudi Arabian Government claim that the tribes of the Khor-el-Odeid owe allegiance to Ibn Sand. This contention is supported by some of the available information, e.g., the statement made to Sir T. Eowle in 1934 by the Sheikh of Qatar to the effect that k £ a neutral zone between Qatar and Abu' Dhabi extended along the coast and some miles inland from Khor Odeid to Sabkhat Matti, but that this zone was not recognised by Ibn Sand, wdio took the revenue from it because he was strong enough to do so (see Sir T. Fowle’s telegram No. T/98 of the 6th April, 1934, paragraph 3 (c)). The alleged existence of a £t neutral zone ' is also mentioned in paragraph 2 of the enclosure to the letter No. C. 17 of the 18th January, 1934, from the Political Agent, Koweit, to Sir T. Fowle. As against this, however, Bahrein confidential despatch No. C/ 965-1.a/38 of the 12th December, 1934, and its enclosure suggest, on the strength of assertions by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and his family, that Ibn Sand has no claim to any part of the coast between Qatar and the Musandam peninsula, which belongs to one or other of the Trucial Sheikhs. 19. The practical justification for Ibn Saud’s claim to the Khor-el-Odeid is thus at best doubtful. But whatever foundation it might otherwise have had is weakened by the evidence which can be derived from the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the past. Thus in 1878 Sheikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi was assisted in sending an expedition to exterminate the pirates of Odeid. The pirates fled before the expedition arrived, but it was made dear that Her Majesty’s Government regarded the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi as responsible for what happened at Odeid and recognised that place as his territory. Later, in 1881 Sheikh Yasin-bin-Jhani of Qatar was told, in replv to his enquiries, that Her Majesty’s Government could not agree to his rebuilding Odeid, ££ as the place is an appanage of Abu Dhabi. ’ Again, in 1891, when the Ottoman Government tried to send a mudir to Odeid, diplomatic representations were immediately made on the ground that Odeid belonged to Abu Dhabi, and the Ottoman Govern ment abandoned their project in consequence.(a m [22284—2] b 3 5 Sheikh of AbfmaW 1 whereby Aefr^SredTKb gaV ? “ undert ^ing to the that ruler and undertook to prevent ^nvnne^l Kh ° I '‘ el -° deid as belonging to assurance was contained in a letter dated ^he l!l n occu Py in g it.

They also maintain— (a) that they need an additional outlet to the Persian Gulf more easy to develop and more accessible than their ports to the north of the Qatar peninsula; (b) that they need to be able to control smuggling from that part of the coast into Saudi Arabia. Their attitude is no doubt also influenced by considerations of prestige and bv a desire to secure as much territory as possible which may contain oil (C)— The Saudi claim to the Jebel Nakhsh. 23. With regard to the Jebel Nakhsh the position is more doubtful. The case for claiming it for the Sheikh of Qatar rests mainly on two arguments, (a) that in the past that area has been commonly regarded as falling within the State of Qatar, and (b) that topographically the Jebel Nakhsh forms part of the range of hills known as the Jebel Dukhan, which runs along the west coast of Qatar, and therefore properly belongs to the Qatar peninsula. 24. As regards (a), it will be seen from paragraph 4 of India Office memo randum B 430 of the 5th March, 1934, that, according to the information e. 1512 / 279 / contained in Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, the southern boundary! 91 ( 1934 ). of Qatar was, before the 1914-18 war, considered to run roughly south-east from the Dohat-es-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-el-Odeid. As against this the 1913 convention (which was, however, later in date than Mr. Lorimer’s work) definitely speaks of the Blue line separating Ottoman territory from “the territory of Qatar.” Lorimer admits, however, that the Qatar boundary was £ ‘ somewhat indeterminate ’ ’ in the part towards the Khor-el- Odeid and, although care was taken to collect what evidence was available, the above description of the pre-war boundary does not seem to have been based on any positive knowledge, but simply on what was, at the time, vaguely considered to be the true position. It has been suggested that the claim of the Sheikh of! Qatar to the whole of the Qatar peninsula was recognised by Ibn Sand on the occasion of his interview with Sir Percy Cox at Ojair in 1923, when he apparently accepted without demur the latter’s statement that he had no rights# o I ft ^ 7 Mnd section IV of the Appendix e. 15X2/279/ in the Qatar peninsula (see paragraphs 6 and aad paragraph 10 of Colonel 91 (1934). j n) ji a Office memorandum ^ ■, () . u { 0 the Political Resident); ' 91 (1934). “ IndTaOfffce memorandum B 430 ol ^ Pol meal Resident); R 1513 / 81 / Dickson’s letter No. C 17 of the 18th J “|’ discu ’ slons it is doubtful whether 91 (1934). but in view of the informal nature o, 1 ment Moreo ver, at this meeting Sir much reliance can he placed on tl s _ g pus p e( j the Saudi frontier ;k Percy Cox seems to have suggested a lm P unlikely that on. ins to the west of the southern part of ^^'^stood^hat was proposed, point, at any rate, Ibn baud can ha\ ^ ^ doubtful whether this can be P 25.

T yjss S” is; *8''“ ““ , “ i .^giession. mentioned here that, while the negotiations for the 01 1 con cession were in progress and before the Sheikh had indicated that he considered what eventually^became the boundary of the concession area to be the southern frontier of his State, the territory in respect of which His Majesty s Government proposed to promise him protection had been defined provisionally as no extending to the south of a line drawn straight across i rom the head of ti e Dohat-es-Salwa to the coast immediately north of the ixhor-el-( deid. I ms so-called “ protection line ” lay in places several miles to the south ot tfte tyatar frontier as later defined in the oil concession, but its location was never indicated to the Sheikh, who was simply assured of protection ‘ ‘ against serious and unprovoked attacks on your territory from outside your frontier.” ^ 28. In one important respect the assurance of His Majesty s Government in respect of the Jebel Nakhsh differs from that in respect of the Khor-el Odeid. The assurance about the latter was given in 1906, long before the present frontier dispute had arisen. But the assurance about the former was given—somewhat incautiously, as has since transpired—six weeks after the Saudi Arabian Govern ment had put forward, on the 3rd April, 1935, claims which embraced the Jebel Nakhsh. It can, however, be said that the Qatar frontier as finally recognised on the 10th July, 1935, was the outcome of occurrences dating from before the 3rd April, 1935. The Saudi Arabian Government protested against the oil concession at the time. E. 4734 / 279 /^ 29. With regard to the Saudi claims to this area it will be seen from 91 (1937V paragraph 4 0 f Bushire despatch No. 594—S of the 20th June, 1937, and the dates in Table B enclosed therein, that Ibn Sand can have very little claim of an 1 “ ancestral” nature to the Jebel Nakhsh. His claim, in fact, rests mainly on the argument that the tribes which frequent this area owe allegiance to him, ^ 1 4 - Vi -1 4 - rAVA 'rv&gt; /'ATY'i v* h 1 H /'v n / J -1 A -v* Vv -1 -r-k ^ * vyj. Much of the evidence available, however, tends to confirm the truth of the Saudi Arabian Government’s contention that many of the inhabitants of the Jebel Nakhsh owe allegiance to Ibn Sand. In paragraph 4 of his telegram No. T. 19 of the 11th January, 1934, to the India Office, Sir T. Fowle observed that ^ the Sheikh of Qatar is more a large merchant than a ruler and has practically no authority over the interior of his State .... where the strongest Bedouin elements are migratory tribes from Saudi Arabia.” This evidence isr / DiokKm’s^etter^o 13 ^ n® B- 0n T oontained in Paragraph 6 of Colonel A ^“ 17 of the 18th January, 1934, to the Political Resident and m the enclosure therein, where it is observed that the Sheikh of Qatar “ has Qatari^deDends^fn^b - C H' 11 ? , as own ' n Qatar■ ■ ■ • Ibn Thani thTsheikh of ^ Bini Mnrra Twn f fh fn g men draWn fr0m the Bini Ha i ar and I ' thirdtTbe is rManasfr- ree 68 PaStUrmg al ° ng the b ° rder of ( '&gt; atar ' 31 To sum up it may be that the Saudi Arabian Government do not administer the Jebel Nakhsh, even though they may say they do and even though the tribes of the area pay them tribute as a means of securing themselves against raids by tnbes under effective Saudi control. But neither does, for that matter, me bneikn 01 Qatar, and since this territory is directly ruled by nobody the most logical course might be, were it not for extraneous commitments, to attribute it to the Power to whom the local tribes recognise their allegiance. Indeed from the evidence at present available it seems that the Sheikh of Qatar exercises little if any, authority over most of the Qatar peninsula, let alone Jebel Nakhsh. furthermore, the boundaries of his State were never clearly defined until,Nn 1935, they were shown in the Qatar oil concession agreement to be the same as the limits of the area of the concession itself. 32. In these circumstances, it is difficult to rebut an argument to the effect that much of what has been regarded and recognised as Qatar territory is res nullius, as defined by Mr. Beckett in his minute of the 29th August, 1934, since the Sheikh of Qatar exercises no control over it and has no demonstrably valid claim to it, and that the Sheikh was exceeding his rights in including the Jebel Nakhsh or any other part of such territory in the area of the 1935 concession. The argument is strengthened by the consideration, which has already been discussed, that the position of local tribal chiefs exercising no established rule is fundamentally different from that of the rulers of recognised States whose independence is commonly recognised or guaranteed by His Majesty’s Government, and that in the case of the former the payment of tribute may legitimately be taken as a factor determining their allegiance to any particular ruler and consequently establishing their political status. If on this basis it can be shown that the local tribes owe allegiance to Ibn Sand, as appears to be the case, the latter may well consider himself fully justified in claiming the territory in question for Saudi Arabia. E. 1513/81/ 91 (1934). (H )—The Saudi claim to territory otherwise claimed for A bu Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate. 33. The Saudi Arabian claim to territory in South-Eastern Arabia formulated in 1934 is not limited to the Khor-el-Odeid and the Jebel Nakhsh, but also extends to territory otherwise claimed by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, the Sultan of Muscat, and certain rulers or tribes, of whom the most important is the Sultan of Shihr and Mokalla, in the Aden Protectorate. These claims appear, however, to be of less importance in Saudi eyes than the claims to the Khor-el-Odeid and the Jebel Nakhsh, and only require brief notice, particularly as the arguments advanced by Ibn Saud and the counter-arguments of His Majesty’s Government do not differ materially from those employed by the two parties over the two principal claims. 34. With regard to territory claimed by Saudi Arabia, but belonging, if it belongs to anybody, to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, most of what has been said concerning the claim to the Khor-el-Odeid also applies to the claim to territory further south and east. The Saudi claim is based on histoiical arguments and on tribal allegiances, and His Majesty’s Government’s counter-argument is based mainly on Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, whereby the Saudi Arabian Govein- ment undertook to recognise the special treaty relations existing between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Sheikhs. 35' In 1937 the question arose of determining the western frontiers of the territory of the Sultan of Muscat, so as to ensure that no offer made to Ibn Saud should unwittingly impinge on these frontiers. In spite of his suspicion and an ingrained unwillingness to formulate his claims with precision, the Sultan was finally persuaded to put forward a statement of the limits of the territory which he believed to belong to him. He stated that he would have no objection if the8 ass eftfjSyrsasaas »*'«« (S p^a|raph 20 of the memorandum referred to at the begmnmg of tin, memorandum) : The intersection of 52° E. and 23° N. ... The intersection of 54° 40' E. and 22° 40 N. The intersection of 55° 40' E. and 22° N. ... The intersection of 55° E. and 20° N. ... C D E G In August of that year, the Foreign Office suggested to the India Office that a communication might be addressed to the bultan, mentioning that His Majesty s Government had taken note of the fact that, while he could not state precisely the limits of his claims, he at any rate lodged no claim to territory beyond the points D, E, G, and H as defined by the above co-ordinates. It should be noted that, except for Dhofar, the hold of the Sultan over any territory west of the Ha jar mountains is exceedingly precarious. 36. Along the frontier of the Aden Protectorate, the claims of Ibn Saud are mainly based upon the “ Dira ” of the Murra tribe, which ranges over large parts of Ruba-al-Khali. The Aden Government maintain that tribes dependent on the Qu’aiti Sultan of Shi hr and Mukalla (including tribes belonging to the Kathiri Sultan of Seiyun) and the Mohri Sultan of Kishn and Socotra range as far north, when in search of grazingjgrounds, as a line joining the intersection of meridian 55° E. with parallel 20° N. and the intersection of the Violet line with parallel 18° N., although in the last resort a line running some twenty to thirty miles further south might be conceded. The tribes mainly concerned are the Seiar, Awamir, Manahil and Mahra. (E)— Conclusion. 37. The foregoing paragraphs show that the country adjoining the Khor- el-Odeid as well as the Jebel Nakhsh are areas inhabited by tribes who may owe allegiance and pay tribute to Ibn Saud. and are. at any rate, probably 7 bevond the effective control of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi or the Sheikh of Qatar; that in These circumstances Ibn Saud is legally entitled, in spite of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. to claim them as being under his sovereignty; but that His Majesty’s Government are precluded from admitting this claim by reason of the fact that they have in the past formally acknowledged these areas to be within the territory of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the Sheikh of Qatar respectively notwithstanding the absence of any clear ground on which the claims io sovereignty of these Sheikhs could he sustained. 38. The steps which have been taken since 1934 to find a solution of this problem are the sunject of a separate memorandum. Eastern Department, June 30, 1940. Appendix. Minute by Mr. W. E.

It is not by any means conclusive, because the agreement of 1915 proceeds on the tooting that the boundaries of Ibn Sand on one hand and Qatar on the other are all to be delimited by agreement. The most that can be said is that the 1915 agreement appears to proceed on the assumption that in the future delimitation by agree ment the criterion should be the areas over which Ibn Saud and his predecessors and the Sheikh of Qatar, &amp;c., possessed in the past, and this rather suggests that we did not think the blue line agreement with Turkey was necessarily to be relevant. This is, of course, not conclusive, because it may well be that Ibn Saud and his predecessors could not really establish claims on past history to territory crossing the blue line or even coming anywhere near it, and wm would not put the blue line into the agreement because we were not then prepared to admit that he could establish a claim that even went as far as this. I doubt very much if the 1927 treaty carries the matter any further. The 1922 agreement^ relates to am area which is so far distant from the blue line that it can hardly be said to be directly relevant at all. The most that can be said about it is that the frontier with Koweit there agreed upon is quite different from that laid down in the treaty with Turkey of 1913 and once again the arrangements w T ith Turkey do not appear to have oeen taken as the basis for fixing the new frontiers. The aigument alone is not, I think, very conclusive, but is, of course, a straw which acquires some force when added to other indications of the same kind More nearly relevant are the lines drawn by Sir Percy Cox in 1922 at liqair actually m the areas concerned (E. 1512, para. 4 of the India Office memorandum) limifs wTw d l?

This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Jebel Naksh</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khor-el-Odeid</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sea bed mining</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Eastern Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Qatar Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Iraq Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Department of State</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Division</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Frank Holmes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002a5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
