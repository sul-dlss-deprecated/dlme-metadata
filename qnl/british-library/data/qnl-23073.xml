Mr. Muntz who is a Director of Air Works Limited, Indian National Airways Limited, and Messrs. Misr Air Corpo ration called to see me this morning. He said that he had come here for the purpose of endeavouring to interest the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited in running an air service for their own business. Ke emphasised that his concern was entirely British and stated that he hoped to put British airways ahead of foreign competitors. Ke stated further that he was in close consultation with Air Marshal Sir Keith Park and that he would be granted adequate facilities by the Royal Air Force both in the provision of spare parts and in the use of landing grounds. 2. I said I could not understand why the Oil Company should wish to use aircraft and I said I thought that the Arabian American Oil Company on the mainland might be interested and possibly Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited who had certain concessions on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. I made it quite clear that without referring to my records I could not inform him what the Political reaction would be should he desire to start operations and how his company would be affected by the various agreements between His Majesty's Government and His Highness the Shaikh. Mr. Muntz said that the question of agreements would have to be dealt with by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited if they were interested. 3. It seems that in 1940 Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited was interested in starting a local air service but from a conversation which I had two evenings ago with Mr. Hamilton I am inclined to think that the interest has waned. However Mr. Muntz has promised to see me again tomorrow and will inform me of the result of the conversation which he hopes to hold with the Oil Company Manager this after noony® 4. On the morning of the 18th Mr. Muntz informed me that his conversations with Mr. Hamilton and Mr. ^nderson of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited had convinced him that the Company were not interested in an air service. In answer to my enquiry about the American Arabian Oil Company he said that he had discovered that owing to the absence of Mr. Ohliger the General Manager it would be necessary for him to visit the United States if he desired to contact their Directors. 21-3-44. ( i i^ * fc 6 . © jjear Bewoor, 'v\ % BOth October, 1944. You will remeiaoer that at tiie .neetir.g ’ at the India Office on 4th nugust the question was raised of tne position of the pro tected Arab sheikdoms in tne Persian Gulf in respect of cabotage (vice paragraph 3 (9) of tne minutes of the meeting). This mat-ter was, as promisee, taken up with the Foreign Office and the air Ministry and as a result the following phrase has been proposed for inclusion in the definition in any international .convention of the territories to which cabotage should apply: ‘'uerritories under the protection, jurisdiction or authority of the contracting parties'. 2. It has oeen carefull considered fro,a the legal point of view whether, in order to safeguard the United kingdoms cabotage rights in the Arab sheikdoms it would oe better to rel^ on the term 'protectorate' as used in the existing Paris Air Convention or whether it would be safer to employ so le new phrase. The distinct ion between a protectorate and a protected state is largely one . . which we ourselves have iade for our own constitutional purposes, a protectorate being a territory which has not got a local sovereign but which is at *the sa ie tine net administered by us as an ordinary colony; whereas a protected state has its own native sovereign. In international law, however, there does not appear to be any distinction between a protectorate and a protected state; indeed, the term 'protectorate' is mainly used with reference to what we should call a protected state. There is m doubt that the French term 'protectorat' would cover a protected state. Therefore, unless it appeared on investigation that in practice protected states such as the Arab sheikdoms had not been regarded as corning within tne term 'protectorate' for the purposes of tne Paris Con vention, it would be sufficient to rely on this term as covering them arid therefore, in any new convention, simply uo repeat the phraseology of the old one. To adopt this course might enable the Arab Sheikdoms to be covered without the issue being actually raised. 3. Nevertheless, our inclination, subject to tne views of the Government of India, is tnat it is better to come into the open, as it is probable that the issue will be raised in any event. it is conceivable that the Americans nay object to a French terri tories in the Far Bast. It is oy no means impossible that they may adopt a similar attitude in regard to British protected states under the aegis of the Colonial Office, such as Zanzibar and the Malay States, to say nothing of Buton territories in a similar position in the Far Bast. Therefore, if the issue is likely to emerge in a wider field at the forthcoming international conference, there will be no particular point in adhering.to the term 'protectorate' if a a better phraseology can be found. The fact that the term 'protect orate' does cover a protected otate, as a natter of international law, does not, cf course, mean that for the purposes of Treaty defin ition there may not be some phrase which would oe preferable. The term in GOi.imon use in treaties tc which ills majesty’s Government is a party is 'territories under the protection (of the contracting parties)'. Tne Americans like to use the term 'jurisdiction' to refer-to territories of theirs in a somewnat similar position tc our protected states and the Dutcn similarly tend to apply the term 'authority'. It is with tnese considerations' in mind that we put forward tne phrase suggested in. paragraph 1 above. 4.

The largest possible degree of international standardization of practice ^j^any matters is important to safe, expeditious, and easy air navigation; Whereas : These matters typically involve problems of great variety and complexity and require that much new ground be explored; and Whereas : Considerable progress has been made, during the discussions of the present Conference, m the development of codes of practice agreed upon as proper by the technicians participating in the discussions, but the time has been too limited, and the number of personnel able to participate directly too small, to permit carrying the discussions to final conviction of the adequacy or correctness of certain of the determinations here made;f 1 ) See note on page i. 13 The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the drafts of annexes for an international civil aviation convention, which are attached hereto as Appendix V^ 1 ) be accepted by the Conference, upon the bases that: (а) The drafts as now presented shall be accepted by the participating States for immediate and continuing study; (б) They shall be accepted as constituting models of the desirable scope and arrangement of the several annexes; (c) The participating States undertake to forward to the Government of the United States (or to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization if it shall in the meantime have been established), by May i, 1945 ' an y recommendations which they may have for necessary additions, deletions, or amendments; (d) The Government of the United States (or the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization) will transmit such suggestions to the other participating States in anticipation of meetings of the technical committees to be established by the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organiza tion for dealing with the subject matter of the various documents, such meetings to be held as soon as practicable thereafter for the purpose of ultimate acceptance of the annexes in final form for attachment to a convention. (e) Meanwhile, in so far as the Technical Subcommittees have been able to agree on recommended practices, the States of the world, bearing in mind their present international obligations, are urged to accept these practices as ones toward which the national practices of the several States should be directed as far and as rapidly as may prove practicable. III TECHNICAL PERSONNEL Whereas : The development and maintenance of suitable international standards in matters relating to international air navigation will require constant analysis, by technically qualified personnel, of the development of the pertinent arts and of the various practices existing with respect thereto; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves : That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, as soon as possible after its organization, should employ in its Secretariat a suitable body of personnel, expert in the fields of aeronautical science and practice in which continuing study will be particularly needed; and that such technically qualified members of the Secretariat should be charged to analyze and report to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization on problems relating to the drafting of international standards and recommended practices and to conduct and report on such other studies as will promote the safe and efficient conduct of international air transportation. IV METRIC SYSTEM Whereas : A standard system of measurements in all rules and regulations pertaining to air traffic on international and intercontinental airways would greatly con tribute to the safety of. these operations; and'1 1 14 Whereas : It is considered of high importance that figures used in rules and regulations and other data, with which air crews and other operational personnel have to deal in the preparation of and during flights over various countries, should consist of round figures which can easily be remembered; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves : 1. That in those cases in which it appears impracticable or undesirable to make use of the metric system as a primary international standard, units in publications and codes of practice directly affecting international air navi gation should be expressed both in the metric and English systems; and 2. That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization shall make further unification of numbering and systems of dimensioning and specification of dimensions used in connection with international air navigation the subject of continuing study and recommendation. V TRANSFER OF TITLE TO AIRCRAFT Considering : That the sale of aircraft to be used in international operations will render ^ it desirable for the various governments to reach a common understanding on the legal questions involved in the transfer of title: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the early calling of an international confer ence^ on private international air law for the purpose of adopting a convention dealing with the transfer of title to aircraft and that such private air law conference include in the bases of discussions: (а) The existing draft convention relating to mortgages, other real securi ties, and aerial privileges; and (б) The existing draft convention on the ownership of aircraft and the* aeronautic register, both of which were adopted by the Comite International Technique d’Experts Jundiques Aeriens (CITEJA) in 1931. Vi ROME CONVENTION (MAY 29, 1933) ( 2 ) RELATING TO THE PRECAUTIONARY ATTACHMENT OF AIRCRAFT Considering : That the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce is essential in order that the fullest advantage may be derived from the rapid means of communication afforded by aircraft; That the seizure or detention of aircraft where the attaching creditor cannot invoke a judgment and execution obtained beforehand in the ordinary course of procedure, or an equivalent right of execution, affects the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce; The International Civil Aviation Conference ( 2 ) “League of Nations Treaty Series ” No. 4479 (not ratified by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom). — * T15 Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirabilitv of ratifying or adhering to the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Precautionary Attachment of Aircraft, signed at Rome on May 29, 1933, during the Third International Conference on Private Air Law, in so far as such governments have not already ratified or adhered to that Convention. VII RESUMPTION OF AND Considering : CO-ORDINATION WITH THE SESSIONS OF CITEJA rrt* a x 16 Comite International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CI 1 EJA), created pursuant to a recommendation adopted at the First Inter national Conference on Private Air Law held at Paris in 1925, has made considerable progress in the development of a code of private international air law through the preparation of draft international conventions for final adoption at periodic international conferences on private air law; That the further elaboration of this code of private international air law through the completion of pending CITEJA projects and the initiation or new studies in the field of private air law will contribute materially to the development of international civil aviation: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of bringing about the resumption at the earliest possible date of the CITEJA sessions which were suspended because of the outbreak of war, of making necessary con tributions toward the expenses of the Secretariat of CITEJA, and of appoint ing legal experts to attend the CITEJA meetings; and 2 . ' cons ideration also be given by the various governments to the desirability of co-ordinating the activities of CITEJA with those of the Pro visional International Civil Aviation Organzation and, after it shall have come into existence, of the permanent International Civil Aviation Organiza tion established pursuant to the Convention on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago on December 7th, 1944. VIII STANDARD FORM OF AGREEMENT FOR PROVISIONAL AIR ROUTES Whereas : The course of military events will free certain areas of the world from the interruption which the war has caused to civil air traffic; Whereas : The civil transport systems and facilities of many States have been reduced to a level which is far from adequate, but on the other hand there exist wide opportunities for utilizing the airplane, which has demonstrated its efficiency in rendering rapid transportation on a large scale basis, in bringing aid to needy countries and in hastening the return of normal trade and commerce; 4 i2 35 A 5“ V- J2&gt; 16 Whereas : The possibilities of air transportation are so great and at the same time so unpredictable, that it is desirable to promote early development in this field during a transitional period, in order to obtain practical experience for giving effect to more permanent arrangements at a later date; Whereas : Every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory; and Whereas : It is desirable that there should be as great a measure of uniformity as possible in any agreements that may be made between States for the operation of air services; The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That each State undertake to refrain from including specific provisions in an agreement which grant exclusive rights of transit, non-traffic stop, and commercial entry to any other State or airline, or from making any agreement excluding or discriminating against the airlines of any State, and will terminate any existing exclusive or discriminatory rights as soon as such action can be taken under presently outstanding agreements; 2. That the clauses contained in the draft form of standard agreement hereinafter set out shall be regarded as standard clauses for incorporation in the agreements referred to above, it being understood that the right is reserved to the States concerned to effect such changes of wording as may be necessary in the particular case and to add additional clauses so long as such changes or additions are not inconsistent with the standard clauses, it being further understood that nothing herein shall prevent any State from entering into agreements with airlines of other States provided that such agreements shall incorporate the aforementioned standard clauses to the extent that these may be applicable: Form of Standard Agreement for Provisional Air Routes (1) The contracting paities grant the rights specified in the Annex* hereto necessary for establishing the international civil air routes and services therein described, whether such services be inaugurated immediately or at a later date at the option of the contracting party to whom the rights are granted. (2) (a) Each of the air services so described shall be placed in operation as soon as the contracting party to whom the right has been granted by paragraph (1) to designate an airline or airlines for the route concerned has authorized an airline for such route, and the contracting party granting the right shall, subject to Article (7) hereof, be bound to give the appropriate operating permission to the airline or airlines concerned; provided that the airline so designated may be required to qualify before the competent aeronautical authorities of the contracting party granting the rights under the % laws and regulations normally applied by these authorities before being per mitted to engage in the operations contemplated by this Agreement; and * An Annex will include a description of the routes and of the rights granted whetherof transit only, of non-traffic stops or of commercial entry as the case may be, and the conditions incidental to the granting of the rights. Where rights of non-traffic stops or commercial rights are granted, the Annex will include a designation of the ports of call at which stops can be made, or at which commercial rights for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, cargo and mail are authorized, and a statement of the contracting parties to whom the respective rights are granted,*7 provided that in areas of hostilities or of military occupation, or in areas affected thereby, such inauguration shall be subject to the approval of the competent military authorities. (f) } s understood that any contracting party granted commercial rights under this Agreement should exercise them at the earliest practicable date except in the case of temporary inability to do so. ( 3 ) Operating rights which may have been granted previously by any of the contracting parties to any State not a party to this Agreement or to an airline shall continue in force according to their terms. (4) In order to prevent discriminatory practices and to assure equality of treatment, it is agreed that: {a) Each of the contracting parties may impose or permit to be imposed just and reasonable charges for the use of airports, and other facilities. Each of the contracting parties agrees, however, that these charges shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services. (b) Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into the territory of a contracting party by another contracting party or its nationals, and intended solely for use by aircraft of such other contracting party shall be accorded national and most-favoured-nation treatment with respect to the im position of customs duties, inspection fees or other national duties or charges by the contracting party whose territory is entered. (c) The fuel,^ lubricating oils, spare parts, regular equipment and air craft stores retained on board civil aircraft of the airlines of the contracting parties authorized to operate the routes and services described in the Annex shall, upon arriving in or leaving the territory of other contracting parties, be exempt from customs, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used or consumed by such aircraft on flights in that territory. (5) Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one contracting party shall be recognized as valid by the other contracting parties for the purpose of operating the routes and services described in the Annex. Each contracting party reserves the right, however, to refuse to recognize, for the purpose of flight above its own terri tory , certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by another State. (6) (a) The laws and regulations of a contracting party relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation, or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft while within its territory, shall be applied to the aircraft of all contracting parties without distinction as to nationality, and shall be complied with by such aircraft upon entering or departing from or while within the territory of that party. (6) The laws and regulations of a contracting party as to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew, or cargo of aircraft, such as regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs, and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of such passengers, crew, or cargo upon entrance into or departure from, or while within, the territory of that party. (7) Each contracting party reserves the right to withhold or revoke a certifi cate or permit to an airline of another State in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of a party to this Agreement, or in case of failure of an airline to comply with the laws of the State over which it operates, as described in Article (6) hereof, or to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 4 I2 35 A 5m v* , T ii S &gt;e em ent and all contracts connected therewith shall be reds tered with the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization! ^ ( 9 ) [Where desired, here insert provisions for arbitration the details of w h,ch w, l b. a matter for negotiate between the parties t^each dement 1 ( I . 0 ' J hls Agreement shall continue in force until such time as it mav bp amende or supersede by a general multilateral air convention provided however, that the rights for services granted under this Agreement mav be ermmated by giving one year’s notice to the contracting party wh^ak- nes are concerned.

Therefore, the undersigned governments having agreed on certain principles and arrangements in order that international civil aviation may be developed in a safe and orderly manner and that international air transport services may be established on the basis of equality of opportunity and operated soundly and economically, Have accordingly concluded this Convention to that end. PART I—AIR NAVIGATION CHAPTER I General Principles and Application of the Convention Article I Sovereignty. The contracting States recognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. Article 2 Territory. For the purposes of this Convention the territory of a State shall be deemed to be the land areas and territorial waters adjacent thereto under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection or mandate of such State. Article 3 Civil and State aircraft. (a) This Convention shall be applicable only to civil aircraft, and shall not be applicable to State aircraft. (b) Aircraft used in military, customs and police services shall be deemed to be State aircraft. (c) No State aircraft of a contracting State shall fly over the territory of another State or land thereon without authorization by special agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms thereof. (d) The contracting States undertake, when issuing regulations for their State aircraft, that they will have due regard for the safety of navigation of civil aircraft. Article 4 Misuse of civil aviation. Each contracting State agrees not to use civil aviation for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of this Convention.34 CHAPTER II Flight over Territory of Contracting States Article 5 Right of non-scheduled flight. Each contracting State agrees that all aircraft of the other contracting States, being aircraft not engaged in scheduled international air services shall have the right, subject to the observance of the terms of this Convention, to make flights into or in transit non-stop across its territory and to make stops for non-traffic purposes without the necessity of obtaining prior per mission, and subject to the right of the State flown over to require landing. Each contracting State nevertheless reserves the right, for reasons of safety of flight, to require aircraft desiring to proceed over regions which are inaccessible or without adequate air navigation facilities to follow prescribed routes, or to obtain special permission for such flights. Such aircraft, if engaged in the carriage of passengers, cargo, or mail for remuneration or hire on other than scheduled international air services, shall also, subject to the provisions of Article 7, have the privilege of taking on or discharging passengers, cargo, or mail, subject to the right of any State where such embarkation or discharge takes place to impose such regulations, conditions or limitations as it may consider desirable. Article 6 Scheduled air services. No scheduled international air service may be operated over or into the territory of a contracting State, except with the special permission or other authorization of that State, and in accordance with the terms of such permission or authorization.

No aircraft capable of being flown without a pilot shall be flown without a pilot over the territory of a contracting State without special authorization by that State and in accordance with the terms of such authorization. Each contracting State undertakes to insure that the flight of such aircraft without a pilot in regions open to civil aircraft shall be so controlled as to obviate danger to civil aircraft. % Article 9 Prohibited areas. (a) Each contracting State may, for reasons of military necessity or public safety, restrict or prohibit uniformly the aircraft of other States from flying over certain areas of its territory, provided that no distinction in this respect is made between the aircraft of the State whose territory is involved, engaged35 in international scheduled airline services, and the aircraft of the other con tracting States likewise engaged. Such prohibited areas shall be of reasonable extent and location so as not to interfere unnecessarily with air navigation. Descriptions of such prohibited areas in the territory of a contracting State, as well as any subsequent alterations therein, shall be communicated as soon as possible to the other contracting States and to the International Civil Aviation Organization. (b) Each contracting State reserves also the right, in exceptional circum stances or during a period of emergency, or in the interest of public safety, and with immediate effect, temporarily to restrict or prohibit flying over the whole or any part of its territory, on condition that such restriction or pro hibition shall be applicable without distinction of nationality to aircraft of all other States. (c) Each contracting State, under such regulations as it may prescribe, may require any aircraft entering the areas contemplated in sub-paragraphs (a) or (b) above to effect a landing as soon as practicable thereafter at some desig nated airport within its territory.

Rules of the air. Each contracting State undertakes to adopt measures to insure that every aircraft flying over or manoeuvring within its territory and that every aircraft carrying its nationality mark, wherever such aircraft may be, shall comply with the rules and regulations relating to the flight and manoeuvre of aircraft there in force. Each contracting State undertakes to keep its own regulations in these respects uniform, to the greatest possible extent, with those established from time to time under this Convention. Over the high seas, the rules in force shall be those established under this Convention. Each contracting State undertakes to insure the prosecution of all persons violating the regula- Article 10 Landing at customs airport. Applicability of air regulations.

Each contracting State grants to the other contracting States the following freedoms of the air in respect of scheduled international air services: (1) The privilege to fly across its territory without landing; (2) The privilege to land for non-trafflc purposes; (3) The privilege to put down passengers, mail and cargo taken on in the territory of the State whose nationality the aircraft possesses; (4) The privilege to take on j&gt;assengers, mail and cargo destined for the territory of the State whose nationality the aircraft possesses; (5) The privilege to take on passengers, mail and cargo destined for the territory of any other contracting State and the privilege to put down passengers, mail and cargo coming from any such territory. With respect to the privileges specified under paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) of this Section, the undertaking of each contracting State relates only to •^through services on a route constituting a reasonably direct line out from and back to the homeland of the State whose nationality the aircraft possesses. The privileges of this section shall not be applicable with respect to airpQrts utilized for military purposes 'to the exclusion of any scheduled international air services. In areas of active hostilities or of military occu pation, and in time of war along the supply routes leading to such areas, the exercise of such privileges shall be subject to the approval of the competent military authorities. Section 2. The exercise of the foregoing privileges shall be in accordance with the provi sions of the Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation and, when it comes into force, with the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, both drawn up at Chicago on December 7, 1944. Section 3. A contracting State granting to the airlines of another contracting State the privilege to stop for non-traffic purposes may require such airlines to offer reasonable commercial service at the points at which such stops are made. Such requirement shall not involve any discrimination between airlines operating on the same route, shall take into account the capacity of the aircraft, and shall be exercised in such a manner as not to prejudice the normal operations of the international air services concerned or the rights ~ and obligations of any contracting State. Section 4. Each contracting State shall have the right to refuse permission to the aircraft of other contracting States to take on in its teiritory passengers, mail and cargo carried for remuneration or hire and destined for another point within its territory. Each contracting Stkte undertakes not to enter into any arrangements which specifically grant any such privilege on an exclu sive basis to any other State or an airline of any other State, and not to obtain any such exclusive privilege from any other State.Section 5. Each contracting State may, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, (1) Designate the route to be followed within its territory by any inter national air service and the airports which any such service may use; (2) Impose or permit to be imposed on any such service just and reason able charges for the use of such airports and other facilities; these charges shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services: provided that, upon representation by an interested contracting State, the charges imposed for the use of airports and other facilities shall be subject to review by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization established under the above-mentioned Convention, which shall report and make recommendations thereon for the consideration of the State or States concerned. Section 6. Each contracting State reserves the right to withhold or revoke a certificate or permit to an air transport enterprise of another State in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of a contracting State, or in case of failure of such air transport enterprise to comply with the laws of the State over which it operates, or to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Article II Section 1. . The contracting States accept this Agreement as abrogating all obliga tions and understandings between them which are inconsistent with its terms, and undertake not to enter into any such obligations and understandings. A contracting State which has undertaken any other obligations inconsistent with this Agreement shall take immediate steps to procure its release from the obligations. If an airline of any contracting State has entered into any such inconsistent obligations, the State of which it is a national shall use its best efforts to secure their termination forthwith and shall in any event cause them to be terminated as soon as such action can lawfully be taken after the coming into force of this Agreement. Section 2. _ . Subject to the provisions of the preceding Section, any contracting^ State may make arrangements concerning international air services not incon sistent with this Agreement. Any such arrangement shall be forthwith registered with the Council; which shall make it public as soon as possible. Article III Each contracting State undertakes that in the establishment and operation of through services due consideration shall be given to the interests of the other contracting States so as not to interfere unduly with their regional services or to hamper the development of their through services. Article IV Section 1. . Any contracting State may by reservation attached to this Agreement at the time of signature or acceptance elect not to grant and receive the rights and obligations of Article I, Section 1, paragraph ( 5 )&gt; and may at any time after acceptance, on six months’ notice given by it to the Council, withdraw itself from such rights and obligations. Such contracting State may on six months’ notice to the Council assume or resume, as the case may be, such rights and obligations. No contracting State shall be obliged to grant any right under the said paragraph to any contracting State not bound thereby.59 Section 2. A contracting State which deems that action by another contracting State under this Agreement is causing injustice or hardship to it, may request the Council to examine the situation. The Council shall thereupon inquire into the matter, and shall call the States concerned into consultation. Should such consultation fail to resolve the difficulty, the Council may make appro priate findings and recommendations to the .contracting States concerned. If thereafter a contracting State concerned shall in the opinion of the Council unreasonably fail to take suitable corrective action, the Council may recommend to the Assembly of the above-mentioned Organization that such contracting State be suspended from its rights and privileges under this Agree ment until such action has been taken. The Assembly by a two-thirds vote may so suspend such contracting State for such period of time as it may deem proper or until the Council shall find that corrective action has been taken by such State. Section 3. Tcii If any disagreement between two or more contracting States relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement cannot be settled by negotia tion, the provisions of Chapter XVIII of the above-mentioned Convention shall be applicable in the same manner as provided therein with reference to any disagreement relating to the interpretation or application of the above- - mentioned Convention. Article V This Agreement shall remain in force as long as the above-mentioned Con vention; provided, however, that any contracting State, a party to the present Agreement, may denounce it on one year’s notice given by it to the Govern ment of the United States of America, which shall at once inform all other contracting States of such notice and withdrawal. Article VI Pending the coming into force of the above-mentioned Convention, all refer ences to it herein other than those contained in Article IV, Section 3, and Article VII shall be deemed to be references to the Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago on December 7, 1944; and references to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Assembly, and the Council shall be deemed to be references to the Provisional Inter national Civil Aviation Organization, the Interim Assembly, and the Interim Council, respectively. Article VII For the purposes of this Agreement, “ territory ” shall be defined as in Article 2 of the above-mentioned Convention. Article VIII Signatures and Acceptances of Agreement The undersigned delegates to the International Civil Aviation Conference, convened in Chicago on November 1, 1944, have affixed their signatures to this Agreement with the understanding that the Government of the United States of America shall be informed at the earliest possible date by each of the governments on whose behalf the Agreement has been signed whether signature on its behalf shall constitute an acceptance of the Agreement by that government and an obligation binding upon it.73 6 o Any State a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization may accept the present Agreement as an obligation binding upon it by notification of its acceptance to the Government of the United States, and such accept ance shall become effective upon the date of the receipt of such notification by that Government. This Agreement shall come into force as between contracting States upon its acceptance by each of them. 1 hereafter it shall become binding as to each other State indicating its acceptance to the Government of the United States on the date of the receipt of the acceptance by that Government. The Government of the United States shall inform all signatory and accepting States of the date of all acceptances of the Agreement, and of the date on which it comes into force for each accepting State. In witness whereof, the undersigned, having been duly authorised, sign this Agreement on behalf of their respective governments on the date appearing opposite their respective signatures. Done at Chicago the seventh day of December, 1944, in the English language. A text drawn up in the English, French, and Spanish languages, each of which shall be of equal authenticity, shall be opened for signature, at Washington, D.C.

In this Paper His Majesty’s Government present their general policy for the development of British civil air transport and the operation of air routes for the carriage of passengers, freight and mails. 2. In determining policy the field of civil aviation must be viewed as a whole and a plan, to be effective and practical, must cover all routes in which the United Kin gdom is interested—^Commonwealth, foreign and internal. 3. The United Kingdom policy on air transport in the international sphere, as set out in the White Paper on “ International Air Transport (Cmd. 6561) and elaborated in the United Kingdom proposals made at Chicago, was based upon the fundamental principle of order in the air, i.e.—the full and fair development of air services to meet all requirements coupled with the elimina tion of wasteful and subsidised competition. So too, our national policy, while it must stimulate and encourage development and initiative, should do so within an ordered plan. 4. Civil aviation is essentially a transport business. Its problems are in many ways analogous to those of transport by land and by sea. To make our national air services effective, we must not only draw upon the best of aviation knowledge and skill at our command, but must also make the fullest use of the ripe experience and world-wide organisation which has been built up over many years by British enterprise and initiative in other forms of transport. This does not mean that His Majesty’s Government regard any industry or undertaking as having a vested right to share in civil air transport. The test which has been applied in evolving the plan set out in this Paper is: Where can the best contribution to British air transport be obtained, and how can it most effectively be used to build up an organisation which will fulfil our public, commercial, and social needs? 5. It is fully recognised, not only by His Majesty’s Government but also by those who are concerned in existing methods of transport by land and by sea, that the competition of air services must be met in the air. Our national and Commonwealth interests^and, indeed, the interests of the older forms of transport themselves—cannot be served by attempting to retard or restrict new methods of carriage. They can best be promoted by creating and fostering the most effective air transport system we can develop at home and overseas. 6. Air transport is a service in which the community as a whole has a direct interest. The criterion as to whether a particular route should be flown is not merely: Is it commercially profitable? There are services which are essential in the public interest, but which offer little or no prospect of a direct financial return. Unlimited competition in the air by private operators would mean that competing services would be concentrated on the remunerative routes; and that the taxpayer, while reaping no benefit from the more lucrative^ routes, would be compelled to support by subsidies those services which,' although desirable for public or social reasons, would initially, at any rate, be run at a loss, and might, in some cases, never show a profit. On the other hand, if an air transport undertaking is assured of the exclusive right to operate a sufficient proportion of remunerative services and to develop these to the full, it can and should accept the obligation to run unremunera- tive services as part of its general transport system. It is, there fore, a necessary part of the Government’s plan, that the undertakings which will be granted the right to run air services both within the Unitedi Kingdom and between the United Kingdom and other countries, shall possess such right on their allotted routes, to the exclusion of other United Kingdom air transport operators. 7. While in the interests of order and economy, competition between United Kingdom operators on individual air routes must be eliminated, there remains a field of development which is open to and will, in the Government’s view, be best served and stimulated by the entry of* competing operators. Subject to the observance of the necessary safety and navigational requirements, it is not intended to restrict the operation of charter aircraft. * Requisites of an Air Transport Organisation. 8. In the view of His Majesty’s Government, the following are the requisites of an efficient air transport organisation:— (a) The Units must be large enough to operate economically but not so large or widespread as to preclude effective supervision along every route. (b) Each Unit must have an efficient organisation covering every area served by its air lines to handle passengers, freight and mail, together with first class knowledge and experience of transportation and facilities for full co-operation with other forms of transport wherever this can promote air travel. (c) Provision must be made for the economical use and maintenance of aircraft. (d) The most effective arrangements must be made for the training of air crews and ground staff and for their welfare. (e) There must be close co-operation between the users and the manu facturers in deciding the types of aircraft to be used. (/) The organisation should be capable of providing training for the crews of Commonwealth or foreign countries, and should also be able to supply these countries, where required, with technical and operational help. 9. Size of Units. —The Government are convinced that the policy of a single chosen instrument, whatever may have been its merits in the past, is unsuited to deal with the great expansion of the future. _ There must, there fore, be several air transport undertakings. A single entity, even if it could effectively include and use all the varied experience of aviation and trans- , portation which it is necessary to bring in, would be too large and far-flung to fulfil the requirement of individual supervision of all the routes operated. Moreover, while as stated above, it is clearly desirable to eliminate wasteful competition between British operators on the same route, it is none the less desirable both to avoid a sealed pattern of management and operation and to encourage different managements to try out their own ideas. This would in no way prevent the constant pooling of experience and tne Government s plan is designed to secure this. I0 Civil Aviation as a Transport Problem. —Air transport can be greatly assisted and stimulated by co-operation with other systems of transport. To the solution of the problems which air transport poses British enterprises already engaged in other branches of the transport and -travel business can, alike with the British Overseas Airways Corporation, bring a valuable contribution. Their extensive organisation and connections both in the United Kingdom and overseas can with great economy of management be used to tervn air transport equally with land and sea transport. Through tie ir co operation the fullest use can be made of through-bookings, mteravailabihty/ ^ 4 of tickets between air and other forms of transport and the most convenient rail and sea connections on all parts of the air routes. It is therefore of the essence of the Government’s plan that those interests concerned in transport by sea and by land should be brought into a real and effective partnership with the organisations which will be responsible for transport by air. n. Carriage of Mails by Air. —The Government have a special interest in the carriage of mails by air. The Postmaster General is considering, in consultation with the Minister for Civil Aviation and the undertakings which will operate the future British air services, the best and fullest use which can be made of those services for the carriage of air mail. 12. Routes to be operated by Separate Units. —Much consideration has been given to the number of air transport units which will be most effective at the present stage, and the routes which they should cover. The Government have decided that the most efficient organisation will be obtained by means of three main Air Transport Corporations which will be responsible for air services on the following routes: (1) The Commonwealth air routes together with the trans-Atlantic service to the United States and the services to China and the Far East. (2) European air routes and the internal services of the United Kingdom. (3) The South American route. 13. It is obviously convenient that the same Corporation which will operate the air route from the United Kingdom to Canada, should also operate the Atlantic service to the United States. When conditions permit the inaugu ration of regular civil air services to China and other parts of the Far East, these will link naturally with the services to India and Australia, and it is desirable that they should be associated with the same Corporation. I 4 14. The Government are satisfied that the arguments in favour of uniting internal services of the United Kingdom and services from the United Kingdom to Europe in a single Corporation are overwhelming. While the majority of continental services will-focus on London, connections will be required from the outset with other centres of population and industry in the United Kingdom; and, as air transport develops, services will run direct from some of these centres to the Continent. The same type of aircraft will be equally suitable for many of the European and internal services; and the economical use of such aircraft will be greatly increased if they can be drawn from a pool available for European and internal services in accordance with the fluctuating seasonal and other traffic demands on individual routes. 15. The trunk route from the United Kingdom to South America presents a new field for British civil aviation. It is one which our long and close relations with the States of that Continent make it essential that we should enter. The Structure of the Corporations. 16. Commonwealth routes {including the Atlantic). —The Commonwealth and^t Alantic routes, together with the ultimate extensions to China and the Far East, will be assigned to the British Overseas Airways Corporation. This Corporation and their predecessor, Imperial Airways, have been responsible for the develop ment and operation of these routes in the past. They are in close relations with the corresponding operators of other Commonwealth countries. They are therefore clearly the appropriate instrument for the operation and further development of these routes. On many of the routes, however, a valuable contribution can be made by British Shipping Lines with their well-established organisation and local connections, and their experience of the special trans-5 / / port requirements of particular areas served. It is therefore proposed that these Shipping Lines shall be afforded the opportunity of becoming associated with B.O.A.C. in the operation of those routes to which they can make a useful contribution; an association which is welcomed alike by B.O.A.C. and the Shipping Lines. It will probably be convenient, in any case, for B.O.A.C. to operate certain of these routes through subsidiary companies; and as the interest and organisation of the different Shipping Lines is confined to par ticular routes, such a structure will clearly be' desirable for those services in which British Shipping Lines participate. In any subsidiary companies, the predominant financial and managerial interest will normally be held by B.O.A.C.; but the Shipping Lines will, at their own risk, take a share in the capital, and their transport experience and commercial acumen will be represented on the boards. It is the determination of all the Shipping Lines which have expressed a desire to participate, as it is of His Majesty s Government, that the air routes with which they are to be associated shall be fully and successfully developed. 17. European and Internal Routes .—An agreed schedule of European and Internal United Kingdom routes will be assigned to a new company in which the participants will be the Railway Companies, the Short Sea Shipping Lines, Travel Agencies and B.O.A.C. and such other pre-war operators as desire to participate. In the first four groups is concentrated a great wealth of British 0 ^ knowledge and experience of aviation, transport and travel problems. In addition to their knowledge of United Kingdom and European traffic needs and their extensive organisation here and on the Continent, the Railways and their associated air companies have, in the past, successfully operated the great majority of the internal air services of the United Kingdom. The Short Sea Shipping Lines operate and have built up a valuable organisation and goodwill in connection with sea routes to Europe; some of them have also been associated with the operation of air lines in the past. I he Travel Agencies combine a peculiar knowledge of the needs of the travelling and touring public with a wide' organisation in this country and throughout the Continent. All the proposed participants are agreed on the importance of B.O.A.C. having its share in this Corporation. It will bring to it all its knowledge of aviation and its experience of the continental air-routes which its predecessors operated before the war. 18. Although the great majority of European and internal air services were previously operated by B.O.A.C., the Railway Companies or the Short Sea Shipping Lines, there was a small number of independent British operators who ran air lines before the war. All but one of these ha\e been compelled to cease operating during the war, but the Government considered it fair to afford them an opportunity of taking up shares in the new company on the same terms as the other participants. In certain cases these operators have acquired a knowledge and experience of particular local internal routes to be included in the agreed schedule, upon which it may be in the public interest to draw. Where the Government is satisfied that this is desirable, the oossibility of forming companies subsidiary to the main Corporation to operate these routes, will not be excluded. In such a case the pre-war operator will be afforded an opportunity of participating in the capital of the sub sidiary company instead of or in addition to taking up shares in the new Corporation. iq. As stated in paragraph 6 it is an essential part of the Government’s plan that the new Corporation shall be responsible for all the British air services on the scheduled routes. Its right to run on these routes within the United Kingdom will be exclusive. Its services to Europe will be run m parallel or, it is hoped, in some cases in conjunction with the services of other * A 2European countries to the United Kingdom. These exclusive rights are clearly necessary to give economical operation and the running of a ma mumnumbeHf air services. The plan will, therefore, provide for the Corporation to run some services, both in the United kingdom and m ui: 0 P e &gt; which will initially be run at a loss and some of which may never show a profit. Services of this kind are necessary m the public interest and a com prehensive schedule of services will be settled which will serve the pub ic interest as well as fulfilling purely commercial traffic needs. 20 Bv bringing into the Corporation those interests which are concerned with'land and sea travel in the United Kingdom and to Europe arrangements will be made for interavailability of tickets for the different forms of travel on all stages of the routes, for the use of the existing offices and agencies of the various participants both at home and abroad, and for the most con venient adjustment of times and frequencies of services in the interest of air travellers to facilitate through connections with other forms of transport. 21 The European and internal air routes are likely to be more lucrative than some of the Commonwealth routes which are to be assigned to B.U.AA. as the direct operating Corporation. The Government therefore think it g that the financial interest of B.O.A.C. in the new Corporation which ^ operate the European and internal air routes should be assessed m the light of this consideration as well as of the, technical contnbu ipn^hich d can make to the new Corporation. While it is not proposed that I-O.A C.,should have a majority holding in the new Corporation, it is intended that its interest should be substantial. 22. South American Route.-Xte South American route wiU be “sipted to a new company in which the majority participants will be those British Shipping Line^ operating to South America who have associated together for P this &amp; purpose as British Latin American Airlines Limited. Here again it is proposed that B.O.A.C. should participate in the capital and manage ment P of P the new Corporation, but its share in the capital will- be smaller San that which it will receive in the Corporation responsible for the European and internal services. The British Shipping Lines which have for so many years carried a large proportion of the passengers and trade between Europe and South America and have their wide connections and organisation 1 and their goodwill in the areas to be served by the new air rnnte are in the view of His Majesty’s Government, m the best position to make the service a success. They have expressed their willingness to risk their own capital in operating the route without subsidy. 2 o Transjer of Shares in the Air Transport Corporations.—The transport and travel organisations which have been invited by the Government to participate in the new plan, have been selected by reason of the positive coniribution which they can make in skill and experience to the new Cor- .• That thev are prepared to invest their own money without any g“e„t guamnleUirariEtion of their belief in the future of civil r&lt; air transport and an earnest of their intention to operate efficiently, but they have nof been invited merely as investors. They will take a permanent stake in the enterprise; and the Government has accordingly laid it down that'there shall be no transfer of the shares in the capital of the new com panies which are allotted to the participants. This will apP^ ? ot onl y to fhe two new main air transport Corporations but also to the subsidiary com- nanies which may be formed by B.O.A.C. to operate specific Commonwealth or Atlantic routes in which Shipping Lines may participate, and to any other subsidiary companies which may be formed by the other mam air transportCorporations to' operate particular services, such as those to the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, where constitutional or other considerations make the formation of subsidiary companies desirable. 24. Payment for Goodwill. —His Majesty’s Government do not regard anyone as having a vested interest in the air. Although the new air transport Corporations will be entitled to acquire at a fair valuation from existing air line operators any physical assets which are. needed for the new services, the Government do not feel they would be justified in approving an allowance or issue of shares to participants in respect of goodwill or “ development expenses ” previously incurred. The whole of the capital of the new Corpora tions and their subsidiaries will thus be represented either by physical assets acquired or cash subscribed. Co-operation between the three Air Transport Corporations. 25. Overhaul of Aircraft. —In order to ensure the maximum of efficiency and economy, the three Air Transport Corporations will join in the creation and management of a combined organisation for the overhaul of aircraft. 26. Training of Air Crews and Ground Staff. —The highest standards of skill and reliability must be achieved for air crews and ground staff. For this purpose the three Corporations will maintain a combined training estab lishment at which their flying and technical staffs will be trained, and at which refresher courses will be available. 27. Recruitment of Staff. —The constituent elements of the three Corpora tions have expressed their keen desire that every possible opportunity shall be given to 'officers and men of the Royal Air Force to take service with the Corporations. Close relations will be maintained with the Air Council, through the Minister for Civil Aviation, in order to give full effect to this intention. It will, however, be appreciated that openings for employment in civil air transport will not be large compared with the war-time strength of the Royal Air Force. 28. Welfare of Staff .-—His Majesty’s Government will also make it a con dition that the terms of service of these Corporations shall be those of a “ model employer and in particular that special provision shall be made for pilots and other members of air crews in the event of death or disable ment while engaged on flying duties, and for the granting of superannuation allowances to those classes for whom suitably paid ground employment can not be provided wljen they are past flying age. The participants in the Cor porations have expressed their ready assent to this condition. A scheme of this kind which was settled in agreement with the appropriate employees’ Unions, is already in operation in the case of B.O.A.C. 29. Relation of Minister for Civil Aviation to the Air Transport Corporations. —The appointment of members of the British Overseas Airways Corporation will be vested in the Minister for Civil Aviation; and he will also approve the appointment of the representatives of B.O.A.C. on the Boards of the other two main operating companies. The appointments of Directors upon the Boards of the other two main operating companies will be subject to approval by the Minister, as will the representatives of the Shipping Lines upon the Boards of the subsidiary companies of B.O.A.C. The approval of the Minister will also be required to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of all the companies, both main and subsidiary, which play a part in the scheme. 30. Once the Corporations and subsidiary companies have been established and the members of their Boards appointed or approved by the Minister, as the case may be, it is a cardinal principle of the plan that the Corporations and the companies should be responsible for the operation and managementof the air services under their control. While management must vest in the Corporations and companies, the Minister must have a general control over broad aviation policy. Thus all companies must conform to the policy laid down by International Convention or by bilateral or multilateral agreements entered into with other States by His Majesty’s Government. Further, it is part of the plan that the Corporations shall operate, either directly or through their approved subsidiaries, all the air routes which are assigned to them. As stated above, an agreed schedule of routes so assigned to each of the Corporations will be settled. These routes the Corporations will undertake to operate. They will not have the power to cease operation on any scheduled route without the consent of the Minister; but such consent will not be un reasonably withheld if events should prove that one or other of the agreed routes is neither commercially practicable nor required for the public interest. Subsidies. 31. The general policy of His Majesty’s Government is that both internal and external air services should operate as far as possible without subsidy. 32. Internal Services .—So far as internal services in the United Kingdom are concerned the participants in the Corporation to which these routes will be assigned and who are investing their own money therein—are willing to run without subsidy the agreed schedule of routes which will include, as well as the remunerative services, those routes which the Government regard as desirable in the public interest although some of them, if they were dealt with in isolation, could not be run at a profit. 33. International Services .—In the international field the Government have already declared that it is a cardinal aim of their policy to reduce wasteful competitive practices and, in particular, to control subsidies with the object of ultimately eliminating them altogether. To this end, they proposed in the White Paper on International Air Transport (Cmd ; 6561) and later expounded at Chicago, their considered plan for ^ avoiding un economic competition in international air services, by maintaining a broad equilibrium between transport capacity and traffic offering, a fair division of services between the national air lines engaged on international routes, and an agreement as to freight and passenger charges. His Majesty s Govern ment had hoped to secure this by multilateral convention. This did not prove to be possible, but the broad principles laid down in the White Paper on International Air Transport remain the policy of His Majesty s Govern ment. In any reciprocal arrangements which they make with foreign countries, the Government will stipulate for the reasonable application of these principles. In this way it is hoped that wasteful competition and subsidies mav be largely eliminated upon the international routes in which Great Britain is interested. It is the intention that the agreed schedule of services on the European routes and the Latin American service should be operate without subsidy; provided always that services which the Government regard as essential to maintain are not faced with highly subsidised competition. 'U. Commonwealth Services.—In the past the operation of certain of the ^ Commonwealth routes has required a subsidy. These routes are so essential in the interests of Commonwealth communications that His Majesty s Govern ment will be prepared to afford the necessary financial help to enable B.O.A.C. to operate them. New Routes. # . ^ It is intended that the agreed schedule of routes to be initially assigned to the three Corporations shall include all those upon which, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, it is essential that United Kingdom Air Lines should&gt; 9 be ready to operate as soon as war conditions permit and the necessary air craft are available. In the future as air traffic develops, the need for new routes will emerge. It is not intended to make any present commitment as to the right to operate new routes. The Government consider that any new routes should be left open to whatever operator—whether one of the main Corporations or some entirely new operator—can establish that he is best fitted to run them. 36. Power of the Government to require Corporations to operate new routes. —The Government, however, may from time to time wish to have operated, either within the Commonwealth or outside it, a particular route which is not in the agreed schedule of services, and which is not the subject of any application to operate either by the Corporation or by a new operator. In such a case the Government would have power to require the appropriate Corporation to undertake services on that route; but if the Corporation satisfied the Govern ment that such a service could not be run without loss, the Government must be prepared to give the Corporation such temporary financial assistance as may be reasonable. Assurance of Reasonable Facilities. 37. In order to ensure that the interests of the users of air transport are adequately and continuously safeguarded, it is intended to confer upon an impartial Tribunal jurisdiction to consider complaints as to such matters as the absence of reasonable facilities, the granting of undue preference, and the reasonableness of rates and charges of United Kingdom air lines. Such Tribunal should have power to enforce compliance with its decisions. In the case of complaints relating to overseas services—which are necessarily regulated by inter-Governmental agreement—the decision of the Tribunal must be subject to confirmation by the Minister. Co-operation with Commonwealth and Foreign Air Transport Operators. 38. The Commonwealth routes will be operated in full co-operation with other countries of the British Commonwealth. These routes have already been discussed with other Commonwealth Governments and with the Colonial Office as representing the Colonial Empire. The Commonwealth Govern ments have expressed their desire that reciprocal services from their countries to the United Kingdom shall be operated in parallel with the United Kingdom services to their countries. In order to make this parallel system effective and economical, arrangements are being made as regards facilities at the terminals and along the routes. Provision will also be made for an equitable division of revenue and expenditure where it is agreed that a pooling arrange ment is advantageous. Arrangements for parallel operation will not, of course, exclude they should, on the contrary facilitate—the ultimate con version of parallel operation into joint operation whenever and wherever the Governments concerned agree that this has become desirable. 39. His Majesty’s Government will welcome the closest co-operation between foreign air line operators running services to the United Kingdom and the Air Transport Corporations set up under the Government plan. Here, too, while parallel operation will probably prevail in the initial phase, the possi bility of running joint services through subsidiary companies in which the foreign operator would participate, is one which in the view of His Majesty’s Government may present great advantages. 40. It is hoped that the combined training establishment for air crews and ground staff which will be set up in the United Kingdom, and possibly the joint organisation for the overhaul of aircraft may prove of use to other Commonwealth operators and to foreign operators who desire to avail them selves of the facilities offered by these organisations.I r 10 Provision of Aircraft. 41. It is of course, the intention of His Majesty’s Government, as it is the desire of the Corporations, that the Corporations shall use British aircraft as soon as they can be made available. The Ministry of Aircraft Production in collaboration with the Brabazon Committee, has already placed orders for a number of civil types. In war, when resources are strained and Service demands are paramount the Government must place the orders for aircraft tor civil aviation, because they must control and allocate the priority and dis- tnbution of all calls upon the resources of the aircraft industry. But there inust be the closest collaboration between the Department responsible for placing the orders, the user and the producer, so as to ensure that the user gets the type of aircraft that suits the services he is to operate, and that the producer can apply to the needs of the user, the best and latest experience in technical development and in the ingenuity and initiative of design staffs. Air line operators, no less than Air Forces, must have their eyes always on the future and not on the past, save in so far as the experience of the past may point the way to future progress. Arrangements have already been made to bring the new Air Iransport Corporations into close collaboration of this kind with the manufacturers of aircraft and the Government Departments concerned As soon as circumstances permit the Corporations and their sub sidiaries will be free to buy aircraft direct from the manufacturers. 42. In the meantime it is the intention of the Government that in the initial stages where such a course is convenient, the Government shall lease the air craft which they have ordered to the Air Transport Corporations The Government will also be prepared, in appropriate cases, to consider leasing to other Commonwealth operators and to foreign operators 43. In framing their air transport policy, the Government have sought to app y to the development and expansion of our own air services, those principles of ordered progress which they have advocated in the international sphere. I hey are planning to bring into operation as rapidly as the exigencies of war permit, a complete network of Commonwealth services in full co-opera tion with other Commonwealth Governments. They are bringing into partner ship on practical business lines, those elements which, by reason of their experience and organisation, can contribute to the full and rapid development of British air transport In this way the Government believe that they can best meet the needs of the peoples of tho world for safe, regular efficient and economical air transport ”, and enable British civil aviation, which has had to be subordinated to the supreme war effort, to take its rightful place on the airways of the world. 8 p LONDON PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTY'S STATIONERY OFFICE To be purchased directly from H.M.

A far as the Civ'il Aviation aspect of the airport design is concerned, the following action was taken before leaving Khartoum:- A cony of the Capetown Class I and Class II southern Africa airport standards was given to Lr. Hoger Phillips (Deputy Assistant Civil secretary (Air), Sudan Government) with a recommendation that whereas the site should be planned initially to Class II standards, the possibility of later .exoandinr it to conform with the Class I specification^should not be overlooked. A copy of the local surface wind records was brought home and has since been analysed by D.* .0. The result of the analysis goes to show that two runways laid in conformity with the oudan development plan will afford satisfactory coverage. Certain suggestions were made verbally in Khartoum, concerning the location of the civil buildings and the layout of the taxiway system. Af .D.G.,7. has arranged for soil samples to be sent^to England for examination and test. * r. Booth, the local Director of Public forks, who was on leave in U.K. recently has been in touch with a.D. of 7.(C.A.) regarding soil test and runway constructional problems generally. He too has arranged for soil samples to be sent to the^Koad Research Laboratory in England where they will be subject to a different series of tests. Jummarv and Re comme ndations. 7. Khartoum badly needs a new civil airport. If the soil at uordon’s Tree is found to be satisfactory, the site should .rrove ideal. Plans for a joint-user airfield ought to be finalised at trie earliest Possible date, so that a detailed estimate of the probable cost of construction can be prepared. Thereafter as little tine as possible should be lost in deciding who is to contribute to the cost of the project, and in what proportion. 8. The existing aerodrome will suffice for regular peace- ti -ie Cxvil operations by 'York’ 1 aircraft for no longer than is absolutely necessary. In any event a certain amount of money will almost certainly have to be spent on it forthwith to satisfy immediate B.O.A.C. requirements. It must be borne in mind that the Americans have now pulled out of Wadi Seidna Eoutn altogether, so that this airfield may not be available much longer for use by B.O.A.C. aircraft that are unable for technical reasons to operate safely from Khartoum.

'LB' Oh «*'/“v P. L ty'C'My r 6 . We have been asked for our comments on para 5 of enclosure to p.u.c. The amount due to the credit of the Bahrain Govt, in British and Indian Govt, stock is now Ps. 1,01,18, 947, vide p.242 of F.4/1-IV (below). The Bahrain Govt, may agree to invest a sum of roughly Ps.66,25,000 from this Reserve in the building of a new airport at Hamala, but before we approach them it is for consideration whether such an investment will not seriously interfere with that ’forward' policy that both Govt, of India and P.R. have agreed should be adopted in Bahrain. Major Hickinbotham estimated that at least Ps. 26,50,000 of this Reserve should be spent on essential engineering requirements, vide p.246 ibid, and there are several other proposals under consideration which would also draw upon the Reserve Fund. Correspondence regarding these is at s.4l of F.8/9 (below) and s. 4, 8, and 9 of F.4/14 (below). It would make our task much easier if the finances of Bahrain State were reorganised along the lines suggested in paras 5 and 6 of Govt, of India letter at s.3 of F.4/1-V (below), and P.A. may wish to discuss these matters with Mr. BeIgrave on his return from U.K. Until such time it would seem fruitless to sound Bahrain Govt regarding the possibility of investing part of their Reserve Fund in a new airport and we may comment accordingly.
