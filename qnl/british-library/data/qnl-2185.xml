As explained in the Resident’s despatch of 22nd March enclosed with the C.O. letter the custom for many years past in regard to the succession to the Sultanate has been that after the death of the reigning Sultan his successor is elected by certain tribal Aqils and Qadhis and later recognised officially by the Resident r (unless there are cogent reasons for non-recognition.) As the result of an unsuccessful conspiracy in 19^0 to remove the Sultan and arrange the succession of a member of a rival branch of the ruling family. His Highness made tentative proposals to the Residency that he should ensure continuity in the succession by proclaiming his eldest son as heir apparent, but was advised by Sir Stewart Symes not to do so. In February of this year, however. His Highness informed Colonel Reilly that an election had been held and that Sultan Fadl has been unanimously elected as his successor. The Resident was about to express objection to this action which was taken without consulting him when he heard of the attempt on Sultan Fadl’s life which made it impolitic for him to do so. He therefore confined himself to asking the Sultan of Lahej for an explanation of his reasons for departing from customary practice in regard to the succession. His Highness replied that the intention was to guard against strife and dissension in the event of his death. Colonel Reilly sympathises with the Sultan and sees considerable advantage in a settlement of the succession/ j “■ 'saccession daring his lifetime if it is loyally observed on his death. His Highness is a capable ruler and perhaps the most important of the Protectorate Chiefs and his territories adjoin the settlement of Aden. On the other hand Colonel Reilly does not recommend any departure on our part from the existing procedure, since he considers that recognition of a pre-elected successor would seldom be effective. He therefore proposes to infolrm the Sultan that the election has been noted but thdt formal recognition of his successor must be deferrei until the latter’s actual succession. This is primarily a matter for the Colonial Office who propose to approve the Resident’s proposal subject to the concurrence of the other interested departments. We may I think concur, anjc a draft letter to the Colonial Office is submitted accordingly. (Sd.) G.E. CROMSIE 24/5/33.Minute Paper. Department. I think we ought to proceed with extreme caution over this case. Happily Colonel Reilly is still in the country and it will he very helpful if it can he discussed with him personally. It is at all times a tricky business to introduce changes into ancient tribal custom. Left to themselves tribes are very chary of doing so, but if things go wrong they have their own ways of rectifying matters. The introduction of ourselves as the Paramount Power is a douoly disturbing factor: on the one hand, would-be reformers use us for their own ends; on the other, we act as a brake on the ordinary forceful rectification of a reform which has gone wrong. It is clear that succession in Lahej depends on heredity, tempered, and indeed sanctioned, by election. I This douole principle is well-known: it obtains e.g. in Kalat, where the chiefs have a strong feeling that the son of the Khan should sit in the seat of his fathers and an equally strong feeling that they have themselves an overriding right to decide whether to put him there, when the time actually comes. It is the free play of these two principles which is chiefly responsible for the control the hereditary and yet elected leader exercises by semi-divine right over tne tribe smen. It is of course the natural desire of every ruler to make his dynasty secure during his lifetime. His obvious tactics in a case like this would be to win over a certain number of the electors to declare for a change in the old custom. Before we ourselves should recognise, even in the cautious form proposed, so radical a change, we should have to be satisfied that the declaration/ 1212 5C00 9.32declaration of custom was made by the whole body of electors and was made in grim earnest. I confess I an very sceptical in the present case. For one thing, ir adopting election during the chief T s lifetime, the electors are really going near to surrendering their free powers of election. For proof of sincerity one would require the electors to declare their customs in the most formal and authoritative manner in open jirga or Durbar or the like. It is not clear whether the Resident has had any such evidence: certainly the word of the ruler himself would be unsatisfying. Even without the attempted assassination of the newly-elected heir as the immediate sequel to the new-fangled election, caution would have been desirable, for in a tribal state of society law and order and the whole well-being of a tribe depend on the observance of accepted and indeed revered custom. As it is, it is imperative. (Intld.)

I enclose a translation of a joint letter from the tribal Sultans and Sheikhs announcing the election of Sultan Saleh bin Hussain Jibe! to succeed the late Sultan Kassim. The new chief is a boy 14 years old and is the son of Sultan ] us sain Jibel, brother of Sultan kohoaned jibel. Durine-; his minority, the father and uncie oi the young chief will act as his advisers. 3. There is a rival claimant to the chiefship in the person of Sultan Ahmed b A n ivassim, son of the late chief Sultan Kassim but ho has vary few supporters, owing to the fact thau the late Saltan Kassim by his suumission to tne neiais m It^n airiG. 1928 lost all control over the tribe , the recA. ^owor passing into the Lands of . ohamed jicei and Lis brother. Injphis connection please see paragraph 1 of Major Reilly’s despatch No. 71. dated the 10th June 1925 and - paragraph 1 of despatch No.82 dated the 24th June 1925, on the subject of the invasion by the &amp;eidis of the audali country, a part of which, the Dahir range, is still occupied by them. 4. I am satisfied that the election of bultan \a' Saleh bin Hussain Jibe! is in order and have accorded him provisional recogxiition subject to confirmation byby His Majesty*s Government. I request that the necessary sanction be granted for the continuance of the stipend viz Rs .80/“* per mensem to Sultan Saleh Din Hussain Jibel formerly paid to the late Sul taxi Kassim bin ahmed. 5. In this connection 1 would point out that at present tie Resident has no power to accorc. recognition to the successions of new chiefs nor to authorise payment of their stipends. Consequently newly elected Chiefs have to wait a considerable time be lore they are recognized and payment of their stipends authorised oy His Majesty's Government. I would therefore suggest that the Resident be empowered to accord recognition in all cases of successions and to authorise payment of stipends, a report being submitted to you in each case for your information.

To Major C.C.J.Barrett,C.S.I.,C.I.E. Acting Political Resident, Aden. His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies. LONIX)N. Sir, I have the honour to report, that Sultan Husein ’ hin Ahmed of the Padli trihe, a 'salute chief' in the Aden Protectorate, died on the 28th June last and that his grandson, Sultan Abdul Hader bin Ahmed Husein who has been the 'de facto' Chief since 1919, has been formally elected | to succeed him. I attach a translation of a joint letter I have received from the several tribal Sultans and Sheikhs including the two sons, Abdalla and Fadl, of the late Sultan, announcing the election. Sultan Husein was not loyal during the Great War as he signed an agreement with the Turks at Lahej and his stipend was stopped. After the Armistice, the stipend was restored after he had satisfactorily explained his conduct. At the same time, he signed an agreement recognising his grandson, Sultan Abdul Kader as his successor. In accordant with the terms of this agreement the latter has since carried on the administration of the country. It was thought likely that trouble would occur on the death of the old Sultan, as his son, Abdalla, who resented the arrangement made by his father, was opposed to Sultan Abdul Kader and claimed the Sultanate for himself. It is satisfactory to note that there has been no trouole and that Sultan Abdalla and his brother *e actual signatoriesr* signatories to the letter announcing the election. The succession is in order and I recommend that recognition be accorded to it, and that the salute of 9 guns accorded to the late Sultan may be continued to Sultan Abdul Kader, The necessary application for the continuance of the stipend hitherto paid to Sultan Husein bin Ahmed to his successor will be made to the Indian Government after the recognition of His Majesty 1 s Government has been accorded. I have the honour to be, etc., (Sgd) C. BAHRSTT. Acting Political Resident Aden.:• 0 ■•K /J D u 8 Dated Tliur g day the^ 1st Di 1 Hi j j a 1342 - 3rd July,1924. Praise te to God alone.
