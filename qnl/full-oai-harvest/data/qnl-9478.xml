The proposals are discussed in the light of expected increases in oil revenue in all the states, and the comparatively undeveloped nature of most of them.The papers cover: the arrangements for a visit in January-February 1948 by Dr George Colin Lawder Bertram of St John's College, Cambridge to Muscat to prepare a report on fisheries development there on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat; correspondence concerning the disposal of the huge projected rise in oil revenues in Kuwait; the pressing need for an adequate water supply in Kuwait; 'Notes on a Visit to Kuwait in March 1947' by E W Noonan [attached to the British Middle East Office], (folios 127-128); a brief note on economic development in the Gulf States by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir William Rupert Hay, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 31 May 1947, covering Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the Trucial Coast, and Muscat (folios 120-122); the possibilities for sugar cane development in Dhofar, and the arrangements for an advisory visit there by Brian Joseph Hartley, Director of Agriculture, Aden; the possibilities for a shark fishing industry in Muscat; correspondence concerning a water scheme for Muscat (folios 73-76); and a letter from the Commonwealth Relations Office to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf concerning the question of the participation of the Gulf states in a United Nations-proposed Economic Commission for the Middle East (folios 25-26).The file includes correspondence from Dr George Colin Lawder Bertram.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
