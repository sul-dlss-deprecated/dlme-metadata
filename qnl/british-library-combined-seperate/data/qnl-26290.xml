                           Comorinand Edwards arranging for his letters to travel with
                           Orientaland either meet with him or be left at Muskat.The letter informs Pelly of the Governor's return to Bushire having twice attempted to depart from Shiraz and reporting that he will again attempt the journey in a few days, it also reports that he has been causing problems with piece goods being brought into Bushire belonging to Mr Tigranes who the Governor implies has attempted to defraud customs.Further news of the impact of the lack of rain is reported along with the peoples fears of a scarcity of food and alarm at what may happen to the country people in the autumn as well as news of caravans and travellers being attacked and plundered and growing fears that it will soon be unsafe for caravans to travel to Bushire.The letter goes on to recount the inauguration of His Netherlands Majesty's flag at Bushire, the movements of a Dutch frigate, including its gun salute on arrival, and the careful and considerate actions of Mr Kenn, the Dutch Consul. Edwards also reports on the recent visit of a French gun boat
                           La Bruat.The letter also reports on the protests of the Turkish Government at Baghdad against Pelly's actions at Bahrein [Bahrain] and their demands that Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleifa [Muhammad bin Khalifah Al-Khalifa] and Abdullah [Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Khalifa] be restored to their homes, and enclosing Colonel Herbert's letter to the Viceroy on the subject along with a private letter from the Colonel for Pelly.A letter from Mr Downing of the gun boat
                           Clydeis also recounted in which he reports that he cruised between Bahrein and Rass Rekkon at the request of the Sheikh [Shaikh] who suspected that a force was about to embark from El Biddah [Al Bida] with the intention of attacking Bahrein and that the actions of
                           Clydecaused the force to abandon their actions. Further intelligence from Mr Downing reported that a Dyer boat had been plundered at sea by a boat from Ayenat which was also on the Persian Coast and that both boats were detained at Bahrein [Bahrain] in the hope that Pelly would arrive there soon.The letter also expresses Edwards hopes that Pelly now has the power to act on disturbances in the Gulf on the spot and that with Major Way in Muskat and Major Smith on the Arab Coast as well as a squadron available that affairs in the Gulf can now be managed. Edwards also considers the position that Pelly left Bushire affairs in and which Mr Thomson had assisted Edwards in maintaining and crediting the Foreign Agent with his valuable assistance which, despite all the difficulties presented by the Governor, is the best Edwards has known it.Edwards goes on to report on his having made an example of one of the Telegraph peons who had led a group of servants in an attack on one of the servants of the Foreign Agent and that as the evidence was conclusive he was dismissed and his transfer reported to the Foreign Agent.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189687.0x000034#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
