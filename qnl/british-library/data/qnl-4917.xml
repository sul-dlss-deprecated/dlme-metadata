The two headmasters were then dismissed and sent off by boat on the same day 0 Their departure was ^occasion of an hysterical demonstration. 40. The cause of the trouble was partly the fact that the President of the Lducatien Committee l Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa ) contemplated revising the emoluments of the staff at the conclusion of their contracts to conform with their qualifications, and partly that the hoadmauter of the Uuharraq aohool resented the appointment of an Inspector of oducation. 41. Since disturbing rumours had been circulated about curtailing religious teaching and abolishing Arabic Shaikh ^bduilah held a mooting at which the Manamah members of the Committee, eortain leading clerics and all the teachers of religion in the Government schools were present. The religion teachers admitted that they were in the wrong, but said they could not return to work until the other masters did, as they had taken an uath not to. 42. ii subsequent meeting resolved itself into an attack made by Khali Bahadur -hoclul Asiz qusaibi supported by Yusuf Pakliroo, upon the Prosiaent, Shaikh Abauilah. These two persona stated that even in hugland strikes frequently occurred and persons were not punished for taking part in them, they quest!oneathe right of the Government to * interfere • in questions about the schools and claimed that the schools belonged to the public because ten years ago when they were first opened rupetro three lacs were collected by public subscriptions.

E33. Khan Bahadur Muhammad Sharif the leading Persian merchant went bankruptbn the 2nd June, or rather his creditors filed insolvency petitions against him. There is little doubt that he has absconded since he has answered no communications for over a month, and he is believed to have returned to Bunder Abbas. He has been a friend of the Agency and is a very pleasant person to deal with. It is to be hoped that the efforts now being to effect a compromise will be successful and that he will return to Bahrain. It is feared that his failure will lead to other bankruptcies, which will inevitably involve the Agency in a series of most tiresome disputes, bankruptcies being causes which cannot profitably be referred to local tribu nals.

The Political Agent and Saiyyid Abdur Razzaq were fortunately able to rescue it.before he choked. 235. The various communities were received separately. This causes some inconvenience but is apprecia -r ted. A striking feature of the day was the extremely cordiai] feeling shown by the Persian community even Haji Abdul Nabi expressing himself in the most loyal terms. A recent diving case in which a leading Persian merchant could initially obtain no more than Rs 700/-, finally resulted V, after a year’s pressure by the Agency in a decree for overRs 90,000/-, and this may have had something to do with these welcome manifestations* The Persian community are, 'T however, far less inclined to give troublenow than last year* VISITS* 236* One Southampton flying boat arrived from Muscat with Air Commodore Burnett on board on the 3rd June and left for Basrah the following day* METEOROLOGICAL * 237.

Muhammad At T&amp;wil, Inspector-General of Nejd Revenues and Customs arrived from ijatif on the Lotn October and is staying with the Qusaibis.

He is arranging with the Bahrain K&amp;ifcrfciMhtX Customs authorities to receive copies of the manifests of vessels clearing for Nejd ports, and he has engaged twenty Bahrain Baluchis to act as watchmen. 346.

The pearling season is drawing to a dtt%%fe rou « *close . All the French buyers except Dr. Bienanfeld and hi$ brother-in-law have left, most having bought next to nothing. Mr. Rosenthal who buys annually not less than £ 1,000,000 worth of pearls in Bahrain has only spent some few thousand pounds this year, and Mr. Pack’s purchases have been very limited. The outlook is deplorable, and since the bad prices have been accompanied by a bad yield everyone is discontented. Fortunately an Indian buyer has purchased \ an abnormal quantity of cheap and seed pearls and the prices ruling for this class are actually somewhat better than last year. MISCELLANEOUS. VISITS. 348.

HSJD 2 HAS A 386. According to news received from Najd, Bin Sa’ud is reported to have arrived on the 3rd Sha f ban 1349 (i.e.24th December, 1930). He brought with him from Ilijaz ♦Abdullah as Sulaiman al Bassam of Hijaz Customs and Ubdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil, ©x-Diroctor of Customs, Kuwait. These two persons are said to be coming to Rasa shortly where certain changes are expected to take place in the finance and Customs Department. Muqbil adh-Dhulair the present Nadhir al Aaliyah of ilasa is said to be shortly vacating his post owing to the intrigues of the v usaibis who were not on good terms with him. Muhammad at Tawil, the Kadhir of Najd Customs on this / side and against whom the liasa merchants have written a petition to Bin Sa f ud for being very strict with them, has also left for Riyadh to meet Bin Sa f ud. Bin 3a f ud is said to be returning to Hijaz on the 25th Sha T ban (i.e. 15th January, 1931).

Indeed coming so shortly after the striking personality of Admiral Fullertan, Admiral Deville could hardly expect to impress an Arab. The Admiral returned the Political Agent’s call on the 31st December and Shaikh Hamad returned his call at the Agency. 388. At the closi of the year the merchants and Nakhudas had paid no tisqam to their divers, and on the 30th December a party of divers started to walk to Sakhir. They were persuaded to return without seeing Shaikh Hamad but on the next day a crowd of some 3000 collected outside the Joint Court. His Excellency had discussed the matter with his relations and the Political Agent and Adviser and it was agreed that if the Uakhudas and merchants gave no tisqam within 7 days all their divers would be given free barwas for the coming season. A decree to this effect was issued and the divers were satisfied. The merchants now approached the Sheikh in their turn and expressed themselves as willing to pay the tisqam or release the men on one-fourth earnings for this season, as had been ordered (the usual rate has been one-third, but this was reduced to PEARL IHDUSTKY. —Page 3 one-fourth as the tisqam is only Rs.55/- zxA for divers and 45/- for haulers) but His Ibccellancy somewhat surprisingly refused to reverse his decision and asked them why they had not paid it when they had the chance, fhe Political A(jent T s views coincide with His Excellency’s and it is to be h ped the matter will rest there despite the pressure of the merchants. The tisqam is exceptionally low, but fortunately so are food prices, and the Government is providing relief work by continuing the lumaraa-Muharraq causeway, on which the work had been suspended. 389# Mr# Steel arrived from India on the 7th December by the s.s. f?
