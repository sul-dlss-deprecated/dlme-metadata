If the company fail to make a declaration as to oonmierolal production by a date In 1941 to be specified, the Shaikh to have power to call upon the ocxnpany either to mske the declaration forthwith or to lose the concession It will be seen that the Anglo-Persien Oil. Ooapany offer a higher amount on signature of the Concession, and a higher annual amount when they conmanee drilling (which must happen within 8 years of signature of the concession). jSxcept fcr the first year after the declaration that oil has been produced in commercial quantities, their minimum royalty is also higher than that offered by ttie Bastern and General ^yndloeto# It will also be observed the.t the ^nglo-Persian Oil Company must ma|:e a declaration by a date to be specified i. 1941, iliat oix 3 been i. ound in commercial quantities or surrender the concession. In the Bastern and General Syndicated/ d«aft this question has to be settled by arbitration. Bear in; In mind the absence of any .peeiflo drilling obllgatlona during theperiod of 5 years provided by the Sa.t.rn end General Syndicate's draft for the exploration period, it seems unlikely that tfcsrt there wculd be much prospect of taking the Syndicate to arbitration at an earlier date than that by which the Anglo- Persian Oil Company must mate tfceir declaration. After the declaration that commercial production has boen obtained the Syndicate offer a tonnage royalty of Ra.3. annas 8 per ton and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a roylaty of 10-annas.

The rate of royalty offered by the Eastern and General syndicate la the same as that In India # but there Is a local market to absorb all the production. The rate offered by the iiaglo^erelin Oil Company Is approximately the •erne as that levied by the Iraq Gorernro nt. In Venezuela the rate of royalty Is understood not to exceed E/~ a ten In most Instances, while In Trinidad there are many leases with a roylaty of from 1/6 to 2/; although in recent years a royalty of 3/« has been Imposed.

But where the atete Is the owner of the minerals It Is regarded as preferable that the State should take the whole of Its financial return In the shape of royalty. Apart from the principle Involved there Is bound to be some difficulty In assessing the value of the oil for purposes of the duty, whether at the-7- I^ 1 the w«ll head, or port of ahlimant. There are some cases in which royalty is oharged on the basis of a percentage of the value of the oil won, and endless difficulty has arisen In finding a satisfactory method of determining the value. In Prlnldad, wnere the Govemnent owns the greater part of the minerals and the question has been thoroughly considered, t e idea of an export tax has been definitely abandoned as unsuitable* General Oba^n^r^ The forogoing notes deal with the more Important provisions of the draft concessions and will It Is thou^it enable the Shaikh to reach a decision as to which application Is likely to be more acceptable to him. Besides the points dealt with there are certain proylaioiia which ought to be Included In any concession which may be granted of which tho following are the more Important, ^ome of these may be covered in part by the existing drafts:- 1. During the exploratory period, the work of exploration should bo oommenoed within a specified period, and carried on continuously under the supervision of a fully qualified petroleum geologist. Correct geological piano and records should be kept # which should be open to insoection by r e shaikh/ or his representative at all reasonable times. S. The Company should give an undertakin • at all times during the continuance of the Concession to carry on all operations for winning and working crude oil, and natural gas in a skilful and workmanlike manner and in accordance with modern approved methods; to maintain all productive borings in good repair, working order and condition and to take all prao- tioal measure At o prevent the injurious access of water to the oil bearing formations. S. The Company should furnish an annual report of their operations, together with a plan showing the location of all wells drilled. They should also keep accurate records-8- records of the drilling ' , log8 ,, of all wells, showing all casing Inserted and any water horizons passed through. 4« All abandoned boreholes vhould be plugged so as to prerent Ingress of water, and excavations fenced off If the Goapany Is required to do so. 5. There should be a provision for the measure* ment of any oil won 9 for purposes of ascertainment of royalty. A draft of a suitable clause Is appended. 6. It mcjr be desirable to provide for the revision of the rate of royalty at Intervals of ,say,10 years, on the application of elUier party, such revision to be based on tfce general trend of world prices for petroleum products. Minimum and maximum rate of royalty should be laid down In the first Instance. 7. It Is usual to provide for a royalty on any natural gas sold. The equivalent of Sd. (? 2 annas) per thousand cubic feet Is suggested as a suitable rate. It ml^ht also be provided that In the event of casing-*head gasoline being produced the Shaikh may fix a royalty at a rate not exceeding the equivalent of l/2d. a gallon. 8. Minerals other than petroleum and cognate products, should be reserved to the Shaikh, who should retain the right to lease them to other parties, provided that the operations of the Company are not thereby obstructed. 9. The Company should undertake to offer no unnecessary or reasonably avoidable obstruction or Interruption to the development and working of any minerals (other than petroleum or cognate products) Including water and to afford to the Shaikh and to the holders of prospecting licences or mining leases In respect of other minerals reasonable means of access to such minerals for the purpose of working and carrying away the same. 10. Provision should be made for coal office and resident local representative. 11. On the texmlnatlon of the Concession thethe Company should undertake to deliver up to the Shaikh without payment of oaapensation in good order and repair and fi* for further working all produotire welle or borings together with all oaaings and fixtures below ground lerel, as well as all » buildings, wharves, roads, pipelines and railway lines. Other points will need consideration but as seme arise on oho draft Conoession and some on the other it will save time if these are deferred until a decision has been taken by the Shaikh as to which application he desire to accept.

In view o: the general conclusions reached at the meeting o 1 the Official Sub-Committee for questions concerning the ; i tie .-iast on the 2nd December, My Lords concur in the despatch o the two telegrams, subject to the following observations:- ihe words ouestions at issue have now been discussed ith other Government Departments and' at the beginning of the : ir*8 + + elegraiu appear to be superfluous and might conceivably convey m erroneous impression of general departmental agreement. The draft of the private and personal telegram to the .olitical Resident contains no special reference to Admiralty Letter r/!,02977 of the 18th November, My Lords consider it is important that the letter should be mentioned and that the Resident shoul- be aware that the views expressed in it are shared by the Service Departments. Accordingly they propose that an addition to the telegram be made in the sense that 'Admiralty views as expressed in Admiralty letter of 18th November are shared by War Office and Air Ministry'. 'ter Secretary of State, Gonial Office, S. W. 1 0My Lords infer from the views expressed by representatives of dher Departments interested that we are deeply committed to the U.S. Government in this matter and that it is for this reason that it is not desired to stress the advantages which both H.M. Government and the Sheikh may be expected to derive from the grant of the concession to the Anglo-Persian oil Company, If this were not so and we were free to offer our unfettered advice to the Sheikh, My Lords would have preferred to explain the position more fully to him. It appears to Their .Lordships to be possible that the Sheikh may consider us lacking in candour if we refrain fron disclosing our own wishes, which must necessarily weigh with him in coming to a decision from the point of view of his own interests and those of his Sheikhdom# Copies of this letter are being forwarded to the War office.

Sir, h I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to acknowledge tXe receipt of your letter of the 2l8t December, No.M.03274/32, from which he is glad to observe that the Lords jommissioners of the Admiralty are prepared to concur generally in the despatch of the two telegrams which it is pioposed to address to the olitical Resident in the Persian Gulf concerning the applications now under consideration for an oil concession in Kuwait. No objection is seen to the omission of the words 'questions at issue and w at the beginning of the first telegram, as suggested by their Lordships. 3. With regard to the private and personal telegram to the Political Resident, it is understood that it is considered very important both by the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India that this telegram should contain nothing of a character calculated to lay especial emphasis on any particular aspect of the correspondence. Moreover, copies of the Admiralty letter (M.02977/32) of the 18th of November were despatch to the Political Resident by air mail on the 25th of November and by sea mail on the 24th of November from the India Office, while copies of the War Office letter No.0179/101 (114.0.2) of the ^ Secretary, Acimi ralty, 3. W. 1*(u $ the 13th of December and of the ktfc ministry letter -&lt;o«3*31084/3*6, of the 14th of Jeoerriber have been despatched by air mall leaving England on the 17th of December. The Political resident will therefore be in possession of this correspondence expressing, as it does, the aipport of the rmy Council and tie Air Council for the views expressed by the Lords Coinmissioners of the Admiralty. 4. In order, however, to make c oite certain that Lieutenant-Colonel J'owle has the corresponde ice be foe him when he confers with Uolonel Dickson, it is proposed to request him by telegraph to acknowledge the receipt of the air mail packet which left London on the 17th of December, and he will also be invited to state on what date he expects Colonel Dickson to join him at Bush ire. Should it then appear that there is ai^r risk of Colonel Jickson 1 s reaching Bushire before the arrival of the air mail of tbs 17th of December, it will be possible to instruct the Political Resident to aelay the discussion with Colonel Dickson until the arrival of that Air Mail. It is thought that this course will provide aiiple safeguards and will ensure that the views of the Service Departinents are fully before the olitical Resident ami the Political Agent at Kuwait. 5. In these circumstances I am to express the hope that Their Lordships will agree that the telegram should be uespatched as drafted, and, in view of the increasing urgency of tlm matter, I am to asi that they will cause a reply to be returned to this letter at the earliest possible date. It will be observed frcm the letter addressed by Colonel Murray to Mr. IVarner on the 19 th of Decenber (a copy of which has been sent to the Admiralty) that the War Department agrees that the telegram need not now be , I amplified, and it is understood semi-officially that the Air Ministry also agrees# 6./6.

There are precedents for such a period as Is now asked for In Iraq t where the period granted by the Iraq Governnant Is 75 years, In Persia where the period Is 60 years y and In Bahrain where a similar period Is provided for.

Nothing is said In the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft e &lt;aieessl&lt;m as to drilling obllgatioM, and as the draft no# attmto tiny would have carried out thena-4- p'U these obligations if they only did surface and shallow geologloal drilling. It may be suggested, that they will have to do such work as will enable them to select their areas, but as the comment on this qusstionindioate they can select any nuaber of bloclcs in choosing their 11640 square miles. In Bahrain the Eastern and General Syndicate obtained a concession in 1925* This provided for an Exploration period of two years and a prospecting period of two years f subject to extensions* In 1927 the Syndicate assigned their ri^its to American interests, and they have not yet taken a Mining Lease. They have recently applied for a further extension of the prospecting period and have only recently begun work on a second well. On the pther hand, to undertake to drill at least 4 9 000 ft» overall in a period whioh under the terms of the draft cannot exceed 4 years, and may be less, the Anglo- ^ ersian Oil Company does give an indication of serios endeavour to prove oil* Further the provision in the Eastern and General operations Syndicated draft that they may discontinue^or continuous periods up to 2 years before they run the risk of losing their concession is unusual, and hardly indicates an intention to carry on exploitation as speedily as possible.

From this reply you will see that the two draft concessions submitted by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and by the Eastern and Generc.l Syndicate are rt present being examined with a view to a thorough comparison of their terms, and that it is propos^ed to communicate the result of that examination to the Shaikh of Koweit in order that he may reach his own conclusion ra to the respective merits of the two offers.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your note No. 3. 1733/121/91 of April 9th, 1932, in which you viere good enough to infom ne that should the Jastern and G-eneral Syndicate desire to renew their application to the Sheikh of Koweit for an oil concession, which they would subsequently transfer to another company, His Majesty's Government will raise no objection to the application being taken into consideration together with any other applications for oil concessions which may be forthcoming from other quarters. In this connection my Government has been informed by the interested American company that the Eastern and General Syndicate addressed a letter on June loth, 1932, to the Colonial Office requesting information as to whether the draft of a proposed concession (with special reference to Olause 8 thereof) with the Sheikh of Coweit was satisfactory from the point of view of safeguarding the interests of His Majesty's Government, and, in addition, requesting an indication of wherein it failed to do so. It is represented Hight Honourable pr John Simon, G.G.3.I., etc., etc., etc., l^cxreign uffice, S.W.I.u represented that the failure of the Colonial office to -riv9 in reply a definite indication of its views in this matter prevents the Sheikh of Koweit from taking a decision on the draft concession which the Jastern and Oeneral Syndicate submitted to him on Llay B6, 1932, since he is barred from taking action before knowing what safeguards His Majesty T 3 Government requires in a concession which is eventually to be assigned to a British or Canadian incorporated company controlled by American interests; meanwhile, it is stated, the Anglo- Persian uil Company has submitted a draft concession which the Sheikh of \oweit is being urged to grant immediately. Inasmuch as the question of safeguards does not arise in the case of this proposed Anglo-Persia concession, the Sheikh of Koweit is presumably free to make a decision on it at any time. Thus the Jastern and General Syndicate is placed in a disadvajitageous position, since it is unable to obtain consideration from the Sheikh of Koweit for its draft concession because, it is represented to my Government, of the failure of the Colonial office promptly to furnish the information requested nearly three months ago by the Gastern and General Syndicate. In view of the above considerations and the assurances given me in your note of April 9th, which was duly and textually transmitted to my Government, I have been directed to invite this matter to your attention and to urge that appropriate steps may be taken in order that the American interest involved may be placed in as favourable a position as the Anglo- Persian6 Persian Oil Company in having its application considered by the Sheikh of Koweit.

Sir, In reply to your letter of 13th September, Fo. 98019 /32, on the subject of the application submitted by the An lo-Persian Oil Company for the grant of an oil concession in Koweit, I am directed to forward, for trie information of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a note containing certain criticisms and suggestions on the draft concession which has been put forward by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest if no objection is seen, the points to which attention is now drawn should be considered in connection with the communication ultimately to be made to the Resident for transmission to the Sheilzh of Koweit. 2. As will be seen, the memorandum in question does not deal with the point which is likely to be of principal interest to the Sheilch, viz. the financial aspect of the proposed concession. Prima facie the offer made by the An^lo-Persian Oil Company would on the whole appear to be more satisfactory from the point of view of the Sheikh than that which has been put forward by the Eastern and General Syndicate. It is for consideration whether, when the time comes to make a communication to the Sheikh, the best procedure might not be (1) to give him a brief summary ler Secretary of State, Colonial Office.ummary and comparison of the financial advantages which he ight expect to derive under the rival agreements, and (2) to ue:gest that, when he has made his choice 'between the competing Companies, he should make the grant of a concession subject to the agreement presented 'by the successful competitor 'being so amended as to cover such points as His Majesty's Government might, for whatever reason, recommend him to insist on. 3.

It seems desirable, as proposed by the Resident, to except both Bandar Shwaik and also the possible cantonment area near Ras-el-Ardh. Subject to the observations of the Petroleum Department, it is perhaps unnecessary to impose any limitation on the depth of boring during the period of exploration. No comment. The whole area of Koweit is over 20,000 square miles. It is perhaps desirable, subject to the views of the Petroleum Department, to specify particular areas for drilling. As the Sheikh has himself asked for a 70 year lease and this is the period of the concession granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate in Bahrein, no objection need perhaps be taken. (a) It seems important, as suggested by the Resident, to make provision for the revision of royalties and to give the Sheikh facilities to check production by inspecting the Company's books or otherwise. (b) It may be desirable to limit further the delay which may elapse before the Company declare that petroleum has been found in commercial quantities. Under Article 12 of the draft agreement they are required to make such declaration not later than 1941 f or surrender their rights under the agreement. But this date appears unduly remote and it seems desirable to bring it nearer - perhaps 1937, (o)(c) Third line from end. Presumably in the event of a dispute between the Company and the Sheikh, as to whether events resulting in the interruption of the Company's operations were or were not outside the control of the Company, the matter would go to arbitration. If, however, this part of Article 5 is not common form perhaps the Petroleum Department 7;ould suggest some form of words which would more adequately safeguard the Sheikh's interests. .cle 6. (a) Perhaps the Petroleum Department would confirm the Resident's assumption that as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are a British company 'presumably in the case of war or other emergency His Majesty's Government could control the Company's activities'. Perhaps they will also advise as to the desirability of specifically inserting in this Article (or elsewhere in the Agreement) any of the safeguards proposed by the Board of Trade and set out in the Cabinet Paper No.20 (32) dated 6th April 1932. (b) If the suggestion above as to the wording of Article 1 is accepted. Bandar Shwaik and the Ras-el-Ardh cantonment area will fall outside the scope of the concession. It is perhaps desirable to make this clear in the wording of the Article and also to make the rights granted under its first sentence to the Company subject to the provisions of Article 9. (c) The last sentence of the paragraph seems unduly wide. Perhaps the Petroleum Department would advise whether it represents common form. icle 7. There seems a good case for requiring the An.glo- Persian Oil Company to agree to payment of an export duty of 1% on oil and its products, as also to duty on 1 allall articles imported for personal use of its employees. There is no real reason why they should be granted so wide an exemption as they suggest, and the Eastern and General Syndicate are, of course, prepared to meet the Sheildi on this point, Ho comments. Presumably only unoccupied land is meant to come under the first sentence of this Article, and no harm would 'be done by the insertion in line 2 after all of the v/ord 'unoccupied'. / This again raises the question of exemption from export and import duties referred to in connection with Article 7. Paragraph 2. Second sentence. ? insert after the word 'Sheikh' the words 'as shown to the satisfaction of the Political Resident (a) Last sentence. The period which may elapse before a declaration is made might be shortened - see the comment on Article 5 above. (b) After 'terminate' a provision might be added that the properties, buildings, etc. of the Company shall become the property of the Sheikh. It seems desirable to define a British Company as suggested by the Resident in the terms proposed in Colonial Office Despatch Confidential of 13th March 1930. Line 2. Read 'the drilling period' as proposed by the Resident. In the interests of expediting arbitation, in the unfortunate event of a case having to be disposed of in this manner and of preventing disputes, would it be preferable to provide that the umpire sha^l be appointedappointed by the Political Resident? It seems desirable to provide, as in the case of the Eastern and General Syndicate's concession in Bahrein, that the Company shall maintain a Chief Local Representative in Koweit; that all communications with the Koweit authorities shall 'be made through this representative to the Political Agent and that the Company's representatives and the Sheikh shall not deal direct with one another.'b nnnfidential' No.795-5 of 1932.

My Lords consider it desirable that clauses snould be inserted in the agreement specifying that a percentage of the oil won should be refined in Koweit territory, tnat the plant should be capable of producing fuel oil suitable for Admiralty use, and that His Majesty's Government should have the rignt of pre-emption in war. 3. They further consider that if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company elect to refine all the Koweit oil at Abadan and Swansea, this would be a disadvantage to the bhei-ii as compared with an Eastern &amp; G-eneral Syndicate agreement in which the 'safeguards' would have been included; and, further, that it would be of advantage to the Admiralty in emergency to have fuel oil available at Koweit, which is slightly nearer the main sea line of communication to the East than is Abadan, and also less liable to interruption. 4. My Lords believethat a precedent for imposing these safeguards on a British Company operating in British controller territory exists in 'one Trinidad Leaseholds Agreement. 5.

PiiTROLEUM MPARTMENT, (MINES DEPARTMENT), DEAN STANLEY STREET, MILLBMK, WESTMINSTER, LONDON, S.W.I. 9th NovemlDer, 1932. Sir, With reference to the recent inter-departmental discussions which have taken place in regard to the grant of oil concessions in Koweit, I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to enclose for the information of Secretary Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister copy of a memorandum ishich has been prepared in the Petroleum Department comparing the draft concessions submitted by The Eastern and General Syndicate and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I am, etc., (Sgd) Director. he Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, S.W.I.KUWAIT . Memo, by Petroleum Department The attached document ha3 been prepared in the Petroleum Department comparing the more important provisions of the draft concessions submitted to the Sheikh by the Eastern and General Syndicate and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. Particulars have been added of certain provisions in addition to those covered by the comparison which it is suggested ought to be included in any concession. Yftien the Sheikh has decided which of the applications he would wish to accept it will be necessary to give further consideration to the draft of the successful applicant. There are certain points raised by the Political Resident and the India Office, such as the exclusion of certain areas, facilities for imports, questions of telegraphs, railways, etc., as well as certain drafting amendments, which can be more conveniently dealt with when the larger question has been disposed of. Some of the more important points raised on the draft of the Eastern and General Syndicate by the Government of India in their letter of the 15th April /ofe last (F.28E/N/28) have been dealt wi.th in the comments on the terms offered by the two applicants. Two of these are the question of the area of the concession and the period for which the concession should be granted. In view of the Petroleum Department it is necessary to draw a distinction between a country such as Kuwait, where conditions are very difficult, facilities are few, and there is no guarantee that oil in commcercial quantities willjM will be found, and a country like India where oil has been proved and there is a market near at hand to absorb the whole of the production, while in addition there is in existence a Grovernment organisation which is responsible for seeing that the policy of the (jovermnent in regard to oil development is carried out. With the existing organisation of the oil industry on the basis of large corporations the tendency is for applicants for concessions to seek large areas for development, and such security of tenure as will enable them to obtain over a period oi years a reasonable return on the heavy capital expenditure which oil development entails. So long as there are reasonable arrangements in regard to royalty payments it is in the interest of the State which owns the niinera _L rights that such a tendency should be encouraged. There is no doubt that much waste has resulted in the past in countries which have allowed undue competition between rival concerns. D'78 The (xovernment of India also suggested that the / ; minimum royalty offered by the Eastern and General syndicate was quite inadequate. Here again it would be very difficult for H.M. G-overnment to suggest to the Sheikh that he should stand out for a higher minimum. J)'7 3 In a letter of the 6th October 1930 the / Political Resident suggested that the minimum of Rs.70,000 ofiered by the Eastern and General Syndicate was too low | T) ^ *7 ^ ^ anc ^ that a minimum of Es. 100,000 should be insisted on. /\*A4&lt;(n) This sum has now been offered by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. It may be that rather than run the risk of losing the concession both applicants would be prepared to offer rather more than they have done but it would only increase the1 the difficulties which already exist in dealing with these two applications if any attempt were to be made to start them bidding one against the other. The question of the d eclarati on that oil has beaa found in commercial quantities is obviously an important ^ ^ one. The India Office in their letter to the Colonial •n u. Office of the 3rd October have suggested that in place of 1(8 1941 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company might be pressed to fr* r agree to say 193?. There may be room for compromise on this point but 1937 would only allow a period of five years and the Eastern and General syndicate require that period for exploratory work. It is considered that in the first instance this matter should be left to the Sheikh and the Company to which he decides to grant the concession. If the Sheikh consults the Political Resident on the point it is suggested that his advice should not go beyond indicating that something rather better than 1941 might be asked for. The Petroleum Department has included in the general provisions which should be contained in any concession .hich may be granted two which relate respectively to pre-emption during an emergency and re fining a proportion of the oil in Kuwait, or British territory. It is suggested however, that it would be preferable to omit these at this stage from the memorandum which is submitted to the Sheikh and to deal with these points when putting forward the safeguards required by H.M. G-overnment.K U W A I T . Draft of Memorandum for submission to the oheikh showing a comparison between draft Concessions submitted by the Eastern and General Syndicate, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. ^ v' 10 Note. The comparaison is made between the third draft submitted by the Eastern and Greneral Syndicate in June 1932, and the first draft^ submit ted by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in August 1932. ^ &gt; ' F-79 f'-t Eastern and G-eneral Syndicate. Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Period: 70 years (5 years of which are stated to be for exploratory work and selection of areas). Period : Exploration 2 years. Test Drilling 2 years. Lease 70 years. Oomment. ■Lixnloration and Prospecting . Whichever Company is granted the Concession will xind it necessary to carry out expiratory work as the geology of the country is much obscured by superficial deposits. The Eastern and G-eneral Syndicate refer rather vaguely to ''exploratory work' by geologists and engineers, which they undertake to begin within 9 months of the date oi the Concession, failing which the Sheikh may cancel the Concession. Nothing is said as to drilling and the syndicate require a period of 5 years for their exploratory work. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company ask for a maximum period of two years for exploratory work, which will be reduced if they undertake drilling within that period, to be followed by a maximum period of two years, during whichn which they undertake to drill at least 4,000 ft. Period of Lease. As regards the period of Lease both companies ask for approximately the same terms. In the case of a country such as Kuwait where the existence of oil has not been proved, it is considered desirable that the period of lease should be a long one. The work of proving and developing an oilfield involves very heavy capital expenditure and companies are not likely to be attracted unless there is a guarantee of their being able to obtain a long period in which they may have an opportunity of securing a return on the money expended. There are precedents for such a period as is now asked for in Iraq, where the period granted by the Itaq Government is 75 years, in Persia where the period is 60 years, and in Bahrein where a similar period is provided for. In his letter of the 25th August, 1932, (36/1932) the Political Resident mentions that he understands that the Sheikh himself asked for a period of 70 years. Area i The right to explore ' Area: The draft agreement the whole territory of T covers the whole of Kuwait Kuwait and select am area 1 territory for the whole for ultimate development f period ol the Concession, not exceeding 1,640 square 1 miles divided into 6 or 1 more blocks. f The Anglo-Persian Oil Company 1 s draft Concession provides for the grant of the whole of the area of Kuwait, for the period of the concession. On the other hand, the Eastern and G-eneral Syndicate provide for the selection within 5 years of an area ajnounting in the aggregate to 1,640 square miles, this area may be divided up into six or more blocks, and by such an arrangement they presumably hope to secure all promising oil bearing territoryterritory which is worth having. The value of their proposal to limit their activities to 1,640 square miles is, therefore, more apparent than real. There would appear to be definite advantages in having the whole of this rather limited territory- developed by one Company of good standing. Competitive development of an oilfield by two or more Companies seldom produces the best results as it tends to lead to unnecessary loss of gas pressure and premature exhaustion of the field, as has been the case in many fields in the United States. The operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Comapny in Persia are generally accepted as being in accordance with the best modern practice of unit development. It may be mentioned that in the case of Iraq there was in the original Concession a provision for the selection of areas. So much difficulty arose in regard to this matter that the Iraq G-overnment agreed in the revised Concession granted last year, to accept the Iraq Petroleum Company's proposal for the grant to them of exclusive rights over a large area amounting to about 36,000 square miles, or nearly twice the area of Kuwait. Incidentally the Eastern and G-eneral Syndicate refer to the area to be reserved to them as 'Conceded Territory 1 '. There are obvious objections to the use of such a term and this should be replaced by rt Leased Area'. larkingWorking: Obligations ; The ^ ) Concession to 'become void ) unless the Company has ] commenced exploratoi-y work ) within a period of 9 months) from the date of the Con- ) cession.

If the Company fails to carry out its obliga tions, or to make the necessary payments, the Sheikh has the power to terminate the Agreement. Comment» Nothing is said in the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft concession as to drilling obligations, and as the draft now stands they would have carried out these obligations if they only did surface and shallow geological drilling. It may be suggested that they will have to do such work as will enable them to select their areas, but as the comment on this question indicates they can select any number of blocks in choosing their 1,640 square miles. In Bahrein the Eastern and General Syndicate obtained a concession in 1925. This provided for an Exploration period of 2 years and a Prospecting period of 2 years, subject to extensions. In 1927 the Syndicate assigned their rignts to American interests, and they have not yet taken up a Mining Lease. They have recently applied for a further extension of the prospecting period and have only recently begun work on a second well. On the other hand, to undertake to drill at .^ast, 4,000 ft. overall in a period which under the terms of the draft cannot exceed 4 years, and may be less.10 less, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company does give an indication of serious endeavour to prove oil. Further the provision in the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft that they may discontinue operations for continuous periods up to 2 years 'before they run the rislc of losing their concession is unusual, and hardly indicates an intention to carry on exploitation as speedily as possible. A provision of this kind is included in some oil concessions, 'but six months is a much more usual period, although a period up to 12 months is sometimes provided for. Payments : On signature of the Agreement Rs.30.000* Annually thereafter Rs.20,000, until the Company declares tnat oil has 'been found in commercially exploitable quantities,when tonnage royalty begins to operate. Royalty Rs .3-8 annas per ton of oil won, with minimum of Rs.70,000 in any complete calendar year in which the Company continues work. The question of commercial exploitation to be referred to arbitration in the event of dispute. Payments : On signature of the Agreement Rs.50,000, and a year later Rs.20,00a On commencement of drilling Rs.25,000per annum and a similar sum annually there after until the Company declares that petroleum has been found in commercial quantities when payments will be as follows: A royalty of Rs.2-10 per ton of petroleum, subject to the follov/ing payments During the 1st year Rs.50,000 plus any royalty accrued with minimum payment of Rs.65,000; during the 2ni year a minimum of Rs.80,000 and annually thereafter a minimum of Rs .100,000; unless opera tions are interrupted through causes outside the control of Company, when payment will continue at annual rate of Rs .25,000. If the Company fail to make a declaration as to commercial production by a date in 1941 to be specified, the Sheikh to have power to call upon the Company either to make the declaration forthwith- or to lose the concession. Comment.31 Comragnt. It v/ill 'be seen that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company offer a higher amount on signature of the Concession, and a higher annual amount when they commence drilling (which must happen within 2 years of signature of the concession)• Except for the first year after the declaration that oil has been produced in commercial quantities, their minimum royalty is also higher than that offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate, It will also be observed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company must make a declaration by a date to be specified in 1941,that oil has been found in commercial quantities or surrender the concession. In the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft this question has to be settled by arbitration. Bearing in mind the absence of any specific drilling obligations during the period of 5 years provided by the Eastern and General Syndicate t s draft for the exploration period, it seems unlikely that there would be much prospect of taking the Syndicate to arbitration at an earlier date than that by which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company must make their declaration. After the declaration that commercial production has been obtained the Syndicate offer a tonnage royalty of 3 Rs. 8 annas per ton and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a royalty of 2 Rs.10 annas. To decide which of these is better in the interests of the Sheikh depends on the production which is likely to be secured. And here the amount of the minimum royalty is important. Generally speaking.the Company with the higher minimum royalty will have the greater inducement to produce oil. It may also be said that too^high a tannage royalty may retard production,5V production, and here the provision in the Eastern and General Syndicated draft, allowing a cessation of operations should not 'be lost sight of. The rate oi royalty offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate is the same as that in India, 'but there is a j.ocal market to absorb all the production. The rate offered by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is approximately the same as that levied oy t/ie Ii^q. Government. In Venezuela the rate of royalty is understood not to exceed 2/- a ton in most instances, while in Trinidad there are many leases with a royalty of from 1/6 to 2/-&gt; although in recent years a royalty of 3/- has been imposed. In the case of both these countries, over 90 per cent of the oil has to be exported. Customs Duty : The Company ) Customs Duty. Jo undertake to pay the | similar provision. Sheikh a Customs Duty of ) 1% on all oil produced ) from Kuwait territory, ) calculated on the value ) of the oil at the wells. ) Comment. It is not usual to impose a Customs Duty in addition to royalty. Such a charge might with some justification be levied in a country where the State does not own the mineral rights and desires to secure some financial consideration for the loss of a wasting asset such as petroleum. But where the State is the owner of the minerals it is regarded as preferable that the State should take the whole of its financial return in the shape of royalty. Apart from the principle involved there is bound to be some difficulty in assessing the value of the oil for purposes of the duty, whether at the well head, oi port of shipment. There are some cases in which royalty3^ royalty is charged on the 'basis of a percentage of the value of the oil won, and endless difficulty has arisen in finding a satisfactory method of determining the value. In Trinidad, where the Government owns the greater part of the minerals and the question has heen thoroughly considered, the idea of an export tax has heen definitely abandoned as unsuitable. Vf British Control Claus e; \ Ownership of Concession may 'be transferred or rights sold to another Company, provided that (a) the Company shall 'be one organised and registered either in Great Britain or Canada with an office in Great Britain at all times in charge of a British subject, (b) of the 5 Directors of the Company, 1 Director shall at all times be a British subject who shall be acceptable to H.M.Government (c) The^ Company shall at all times maintain in the region of the Persian Gulf an official called the Chief Local Representative of the Company, whose appointment shall be approved by H.M. Government, (d) as many ol the employees of the Company as is consistent with the efficientcarrying on,of the undertaking shall be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh. British Control Clause ; With the approval of the Sheikh acting on the advice of the Political Resident the C ompa.ny may transfer the obligations and benefits of the Concession to any British Company. Comment. While H.M. Government has informed the Eastern and General Syndicate that they are prepared for their part not to insist that any concession granted by the Sheikh must contain a clause confining it to British interests, if the Sheikh for his part is willing to grant a concession without such a clause; it has also made it clear that in respect3M respect of the provisions proposed 'by the Eastern and General Syndicate which are quoted above and which will enable a transfer to a foreign controlled company to be effected, revision will be needed to safeguard the interests of H ,11 .Government. A decision as to the exact form of the safeguard has not yet been taken but this will not prevent the Sheikh from considering in other respects the relative merits of the two draft concessions. The provision made by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company v /ill prevent any concession which might be granted to that Company passing away from a British company. General Qbservations. The foregoing notes deal with the more important provisions of the draft concessions and wii: it is thought enable the Sheikh to reach a decision as to which application is likely to be more acceptable to him. Besides the points dealt with there are certain provisions which ought to be included in any concession which may be granted of which the following are the more important. Some of these may be covered in part by the existing dra-ts:- 1, During the exploratory period, the work of exploration should be commenced within a specified period and carried on continuously under the supervision of a fully Quaxilied petj-'O-i-eum geoio^i- u. Correct geological plans and records should 1 oe ksp^, which should be open to inspection by the Sheikh or his representatives at all reasonable times.2. The Company should give an undertaking at I all times during the continuance of the Concession to | carry on all opera tions for winning and working crudeij oil and natural gas in a skilful and workmanlike manner and in accordance with modern approved methods;^ to maintain all productive borings in good repair, working order and condition and to take all practical measures to prevent the injurious access of water to the oil-hearing formations. 3. The Company should furnish an annual report of their operations, together with a plan showing the location of all wells drilled. They should also keep accurate records of the drilling logs of all wells, showing all casing inserted and any water horizons passed through. 4. All abandoned 'boreholes should he plugged so as to prevent ingress of water, and excavations fenced off if the Company is required to do so. 5. There should 'be a provision for the measurement of any oil won, for purposes of ascertainment of royalty. A draft of a suitable clause is appended. 6. It may be desirable to provide for the revision of the rate of royalty at intervals of, say, 10 years, on the application of either party, such revision to be based on the general trend oi world prices for petroleum products. Minimum and maximum rate of royalty should be laid down in the first instance, 7. It is usual to provide for a royalty on any natural gas sold. The equivalent of ad.(? 2 annas), per thousand cubic feet is suggested as a suitable rate .rate. It night also 'be provided that in the event of casing-head gasoline 'being produced the Sheikh may fix a royalty at a rate not exceeding the equivalent of -Jd. a gallon. ( S. The Sheikh (? or His Majesty's Government) should retain the right of pre-emption of oil and the right to control coaling and oil stations, docks, wharves, etc., in time of war of emergency. 9. It is considered desirable that provision ■should he made for refining say 50 per cent of the oil (in Kuwait or British territory and that plant should v'be capable of producing fuel oil suitable for (Admiralty use. 10. Minerals, other than petroleum and cognate products, should be reserved to the Sheikh, who should retain the right to leasee them to other parties, provided that the operations of the Company are not thereby obstructed. 11. The Company should undertake to offer no unnecessary or reasonably avoida^ble obstruction or interruption to the development and working of any minerals (other than petroleum,or cognate products) including water a.nd to afford to the Sheikh and to the holders of prospecting licences or mining leases in respect of other minerals reasonable meano of access to such minerals for the purpose of working and carrying away the same. 12. Provision should be made for local office raid resident local representative. 13. On the termination of the Concession tho Company should undertake to deliver up to the Sheikh without payment of compensation in good order una repair and fit for further working all productive wall# or borings together with all cuain^i tmuground level, as well as all 'buildings, wharves, roads, pipelines and railway lines. Other points will need consideration hut rs some arise on one draft Concession and some on the other it will save time if these are deferred untij. a decision has 'been taken 'by the 3J eikii as to which application he desires to accept. When the Sheilch has made his choice between the competing Companies, it is suggested that he should malce the grant of a Concession subject to the agreement presented Ky the successful competitor 'being so amended as to cover such points as Kis Majesty's Government might, for whatever reason, recommend him to insist on.8 SUGgB3I,:D gnOVIjIOlTS FOR IXJASjRIIfG CRUII : OIL :/01T. 3^6 lit auction 'ion '3» For tlie purposes oi such, royalty pi yments the Company shall measure 'by a method customarily used in good oilfield practice all crude oil won and saved, and the Shaikh 'by his representative duly approved 'by the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf shall have the right to examine such measuring, and to examine and test whatever appliances may 'be used for such measuring.

The implication to be drawn from the wording of paragraph 3 of the India Office letter appears to be that the Political Resident should confine his advice to the Sheikh to strictly impartial explanations of the Petroleum Department's analysis and should take no steps to influence the Sheikh's decision. 3. In view of the great strategic importance attaching to the development of oil supplies in the Persian-Gulf area by bona fide British Companies, Ly Lords are of opinion that no legitimate step which might influence the Sheikh of Koweit to award the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company rather than to the American interests acting under e Under Secretary of State, COLONIAL OFFICE. the ( C- ft ! ■' :c i -loV' the cloak of the Eastern and General Syndicate should be neglected, although They fully adrdt that it is essential that the burden of choice must ultimately rest entirely with the Sheikha My Lords therefore consider that the instructions to thePolitical Resident should point out that it is of the utmost importance that the Sheikh should give his decision in favour of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that the Political Resident should neglect no legitimate step to ensure his taking this decision provided that the ultimate decision can be made to appear to have been entirely that of the Sheikh himself and that no ground is given to the American interests concerned for an accusation against His Majesty's Government of having brought undue influence or pressure to bear upon the Sheikh. 4. My Lords also consider it desirable to add that should an opportunity arise to tender his advice to the Sheikh the Political Resident, in addition to explaining any doubtful points in the Petroleum Department's analysis,might well refer also to the following points: - (i) That as nothing is yet known as to whether the field will be a cheap or an expensive one to work and as at present there is a considerable world over-production of oil, there may well be a strong inducement to limit production from the Koweit field rather than to increase it. In these circumstances the 'bird in the hand' of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's offer seems to be worth considerably more than the 'two in the bush' of the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft concession. (ii) The wide experience of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in this area enables them to offer a fair economic royalty, combined with a higher minimum payment. The Eastern and General Syndicate, on the other hand, being almost entirely without local experience, offer a higher royalty and a lower minimumminimum payment but would seem to be themselves doubtful whether the royalty which they offer is economically possible since their draft concession provides for a complete cessation of work for any time up to two years during which no payments would accrue to the Sheikh. 5. I am to suggest that the whole matter should now be considered by the Middle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. 6.

P. ^.6750/32. 5th November, 1932. / Sir, J I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to refer to i \ your letter of Jovember 3rd, Ho.E,5764/121/91, Enclosing copy of a memorandum presented by the United States /mbassador on November 2nd, relative to the negotiations which have been w I t taking place for the grant of oil concessions in Kuwait, and to offer the following observations for the information of Secretary Sir John Simon. In view of the statements contained in the abcve memorandum, the Secretary for Mines considers it desirable to place on record the facts regarding the negotiations, as dis closed by an examination of the earlier correspondence and despatches from the Political Resident in the Persian tiulf. •The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were the first Company to take an active interest in the oil prospects of Kuwait, and as long ago as 1917 they carried out a preliminary examination in Kuwait and Bahrain and applied forraally for the grant of petrol eum rights in the territories of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain. For various reasons these negotiations were not brought to a satisfactory conclusion and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has more than once suggested that if they had received a little more help at that time from the Government Department concerned the Eastern and General Syndicate would never have become interested in these territories. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has represented that at the request of His Majesty Government they had agreed not to approach the Shaikhs direct, but to negotiate only through the Political Resident in the Persian The Under Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICii;, S.W.I.(4) Persian Gulf. Major Holmes, however, on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate obtained promises of concessions from the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait by approaching them i personally with the result that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company forgeited their ahance of obtaining concessions while a lengthy correspondence was taking place between the Government Departments concerned, the Government of India, the Political Resident in the -t/ersian Gulf and the High Commissioner for Iraq# (2) In 1925, Major Holmes, acting on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate (which was then purely a British Company) made certain proposals to the Shaikh in regard to the grant of a concession which were not, however, acceptable to him. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company also continued to negotiate without succ ess • (3) In March,1926, the Eastern and General Syndicate commenced operations ( by arrangement with the Shaikh) to drill for water in Kuwait, and undertook to sink two wells within the area surrounded by the town wall of Kuwait. After several failures the first well reached a depth of 700 feet without 8-triking water. It was apparently as the result of information disclosed by these water boring operations that the interest of the Syndicate in the oil prospects of Kuwait was further stimulated. (It should be noted that these operations had nothing ostensibly to do with prospecting for oil, the Shaikh having refused to grant to A aJ or Holmes an oil prospecting lie ence.} In September, 1928, however. Major Holmes, with the permission of the Political Resident, again approached the Shaikh for the grant of an oil concession, and submitted a draft agreement. (5) In November, 1928, it was realised that the point concerning■Hi mt •fv: -3- concerning a British Control Clause had been overlooked in the Bahrain Concession, and the Eastern and General Syndicate were informed that in any concession in Kuwait which might be granted, a British Control Clause must be inserted similar to that imposed in the case of British Companies operating in British Crown Colonies# No question of American participa tion had, up to this time, arisen and the suggested inclusion of the nationality clause was in fact put forward partly as a precautionary measure in order to bring the concession into line with British practice in other oil producing terri tories I such as India and Trinidad) and partly because the Shaikh of Kuwait expressed himself as being unwilling to grant a concession to any Company which was not under British control It was not until December 19th, 1928, that the Syndicate iniormed the Colonial Office that they had concluded agreements with the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, under which they assigned to that Company such rights as they possessed to explore the territories which they were interested in, with options to form Companies under British or Canadian Laws to acquire and work any territories taken up under the terms of their options. (6) In March, 1929, the Political Kesident reported that Major Holmes had arrived in Kuwait and left for Baghdad, but that apparently he had not renewed with the Shaikh the negotiations for an oil concession. (7) In August 1930, the Eastern and General Syndicate drew up a Second draft concession which they forwarded to 4 the Colonial Office asking that it might be discussed with the Directors of the Syndicate and Major Holmes in London. The Colonial Office replied that before the matter of the concession could be discussed it would be necessary to consult .... \-4- consult the other interested Government Departments, and also the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In the meantime Major Holmes had written to the Political Agent at Kuwait stating that the proposed British Control Clause was causing much d iff iculty with the Company^ American Associates, and that it was their intention to take up the question of modifying it with a view to making it conform with the modified form of British Control Clause which had by that time been incorporated in the Bahrain Agreement. The Shaikh of Kuwait on the other hand is understood to have informed the Political Resident that under no circumstances would he agree to a concession being transferred to an American Company, and to have been insistent that the nationality clause should be inserted and the concessionaires remain British. This attitude of the Shaikh accorded with the p.olicy of the Govern ment of India, who were entirely opposed to the entry of United States, interests into the area of the Persian Gulf. (8) In August 1931, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, largely on account of representations made to them by the Petroleum Department, renewed their application in regard to Kuwait and announced their readiness to make a further geological examination, which was subsequently carried out. (9) It was not until December,1931, that any representa tions ere made by the United States Government. Some of these points were set out in the Poreign Office Note of April 9th,1931, (E 1733/121/91) which was sent to the United States Government. It will be seen from the above summary that while / i „ it may be true that for some 4 years the Eastern and Genaral / ■' Syndicate have been endeavouring to obtain a concession in Kuwait, British interests have been negotiating for very much longer, and without any greater success.At a Conference held at the Colonial Office on the 1st January,1932, the representative of the Foreign Office agreed that provided the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were serious in their intentions as regards Kuwait it would be as well to keep the position open for the present as far as the United States was concerned. As regards the complaint of delay in completing the comparison of the two draft concessions referred to in your letter, the Secretary for Mines desires to point out that it is not the case that no progress has been made in the matter, A critical examination of the Eastern and General Syndicated draft had already been prepared in the Petroleum Department when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's draft concession was received. It was however agreed at a Departmental Conference that it would be advisable to defer sending this until a comprehensive statement could be drawn up, comparing the relative merits of the two drafts. In point of fact, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&amp;s draft was not received in the Petroleum Department until September 14th, at a time when, as it happened, the staff of the Department was depleted by illness, and many other more urgent questions had to be dealt with. It cannot be accepted, moreover, that the delay of 4 years, to which Mr. m ellon refers, can be attributed to the Petroleum Department, and it would be futile to suggest that a delay of a few weeks in comparing the terms of the draft concer-siona has in any way prejudice the Eastern and General Syndicate or the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The points involved in considering the draft concessions raise technical questions of some difficulty, ■ h y / ■ but the Secretary for Mines hopes to be in a position to submit a statement comparing the/two draft concessions wit theii -6- the next few days.

It should however be made clear to Shaikh that His Majesty's Government wish to leave it entirely to him to decide whether or not this circumstance affects his choice. The general observations which follow the comments on British control clause should be communicated to Shaikh as they stand except that paragraphs 8 and 9i The matters dealt witA in the deleted paragraphs will be taken up at a later stage# Also last sentence of all, commencing * when Shaikh has made his choice* should be deleted, this being a matter for you to arrange with Shaikh and you should take a suitable opportunity of bringing suggestion in that sentence to his notice. As you are aware, it is very desirable from point of view of His Majesty's Government to reach a definite decision as soon as possible in view of pressure now being brought to bear by American oil interests and it is hoped that you and Political Agent, Kuwait, will now be able to persuade Shaikh to reach a decision between the rival applicants in the light of information contained in memo randum which will be communicated to him as above* You will appreciate that it is most important in case Shaikh decides in favour of Anglo-Persian Oil Company that His Majesty^ Government should be able to avoid any suggestion that pressure has been brought to bear on him, or that decision is not the Shaikh's own* In the circumstances, while you and Political Agent are at liberty to give Shaikh any explanations for which he may ask, either of the statements in memorandum or of effects in the light of that draft concession, you should leave it entirely to him to make the choice on his sole responsibility® - Secretary of State for the Colonies -Telegram From y 82/1 &amp; 86/1.

In a ncte from the British Foreign Secretary, dated AI - vil - ' 1952 'No. E 1733/121/91), regarding en application of the Eastern end General Syndicate, Limited, for an oil concession in Koweit, reference is made to the extended p viod cf time th &amp; t oil companies have been interested in oil lands in Koweit. ^he ^astern and General Syndicate initiated and carried cn negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit for an il concession in his Principality with the knowledge and approval of the British Government but it was not until ' - er American interests 'became associated in the venture -h h- dyndlcate in 192^ that th© British (Jovsmment required {in 1^23) th© inclusion in the concession agreement i a 'nationality clause' f which clause would have the effect ' deluding any ^ut purely British interests f rom exploiting such a concession. Thus the Syndicate for years prior to 1927 and in agreement with American interests since 1987 has contin- i .ut y endeavcred to clDtain a concession in Koweit very similar in principle to a concession which, with the knowledge of the British Foreign Office, had been granted to the Syndicate in the Bahrein Ielandso Last December American interest in the Kcweit concession formed the 'basis of representations by the American Ambassador to the British Secretary of State for Foreign AffairSo In referring to these representations, the Foreign Office note cf April 9, mentioned above, stated that !r His Majesty's Government for their part are prepared to agree to the omission from any oil concession, which the SheikhOt 7 'Sheikh may 'be prepared to grant f of a clause confining it to British intereGts On Oeptenxber 6, 1932, however, the American Embassy ?

In acknowledging this note of September 6, e Foreign Office note in reply stated; 'Kis Majesty s Government decided they could net advise the Sheikh to give preferential treatment to the Eastern ana General Syndicate'. In the opinion of the Department of State., seme mi sunder standing may exist in the mind of the British Government in this connection, since no preferential treatment has been asked for American in teres nor has any been granted• It may 'be recalled that the American Ambassador, in discussing the jKcweili Oil concession with sir John Simon lest December, pointed out that the Eastern and General Syndicate had initiated and carried on its negotiations with the Sheikh with the knowledge and approval of the British Government; that the Syndicate had offered the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the opportunity, over six years ago, to interest itself in the Koweit oil concession which opportune ty that company declined; that acc. lading ■-c h3,&amp; Information it was only after efforts to interest the Anglo -Persian Oil Company and other British groups i- h- said concession that the Syndicate sought to interest, and, inin November 19 2 7 f succeeded In Interesting the American '• y 8tnce then «aeoci«ted with It In the venture; hat ..t W a S efter these American Interests became associated fiyncucate in 19S7 that the British Gcvernment in 1 88 insisted upon the incXusion of a 'nationality clause' which for a period of severs! years from that date had - Syndicate from consummating with the Sheikh 1 sou S ht ' Since the withdrawal of the ^lo-Versian Oil Company in 1926, it is only, I under- e-.a-, during this last year (1931-1932) of the Eastern eaeral Syndicate's negotiations that the Anglo- Persian Oil Company (in October 1931) manifested further - in vsit, on the contrary, the Syndicate has ' n conducting its negotiations with unceasing activity 'or many years. It may also be recalled that it was not il f this year that the British oovernment reached decision to the urgent representations initiated by the American Ambassador in the latter part of last year. In a most recent Foreign Office note it was stated ihe Ang o-persian oil Company submitted a draft noesslcn for coneideration in August last, and study this Anglo -Persian draft will necessitate further and nsldsr &amp;Me -slay in His Majesty's Government's reaching ' c^noluwlca regarding the draft concession which sub sequent to receipt of the Foreign Office note of April 9.. 1 '?3, the Eastern and General Syndicate submitted to the n ; lSb cn I!ay 26 » tllus renewing its application for the v.eit oil concession which, as above Indicated, it hae ^ en negotiating in association with American Interests unremittingly for many yearso Withr 1th rio^renc^ to r«Dres«s&gt;ntation8 made by the American Ambassador to the Pcreign Secretary In December, it may 'be well to draw attention to General Dawes* letter to Sir John Simon of December 22, pointing out the Mining .Lease Act of February 25, 1920, regarding .anis under which British subjects are given tha same treatment as American citizens.

IffiiSMM* )29 7 7/32. lath 1932# Sir, /nil With reference to foreign Office letter Ho # M.5929/121/91 of 15th tfoTember, 1932, to the Colonial Office, in which it is suggested that the Inter-departmental Meeting proposed by the Admiralty to discuss the telegraphic instructions to be sent to tne Political Resident, Persian Gulf, in the matter of the ^ .oweit Oil Concession, might be unnecessary if the instructions proposed in India Office letter No.P.Z.6809/32 of 12th November to Colonial Office were acceptable to other Departments, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to offer the following observations for the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. 2. The implication to be drawn from the wording of paragraph 3 of the India Office letter appears to be that the Political Resident should confine his advice to the Sheikh to strictly impartial explanations of the Petroleum Department^ analysis and should take no steps to influence the Sheikh's decision. 3. In view of the great strategic importance attaching to the development of oil supplied in the Persian Gulf area by bona fide British Companies, My Lords are of opinion that no legitimate Under Secretary of State, 8tep COLONIAL OPPICE, S.W.I,step which might influence the Sheikh of Koweit to award the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company rather than to the American interests acting under the cloak of the Eastern an general syndicate should be neglected, although They fully admit that itis essential that the burden of choice must ultimately rest entirely with the Sheikh. My Lords therefore consider that the instructions to the Political Resident should point out that it is of the utmost importance that the Sheikh should give his decision in farour of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co.apany and that the Political Resident should neglect no legitimate step to ensure his taking this decision provided th the ultimate decision can be made to appear to have been entirely that of the Sheikh himself and that no ground is ^iyen to the American interests concerned for an accusation against His Majes ty's Government ofhaving brought undue influence or pressure to bear upon the Sheikh, 4, My Lords also consider it desirable to add that should an opportunity arise to tender his advice to the Sheikh the Political Resident, in addition to explaining any doubtful points in the Petroleum Department *s analysis, might well refer also to the following points:- (i) That as nothing is yet known as to whether the field will be a cheap or an expensive one to work and as at present there is a considerable world over-production of oil, there may well be a strong inducement to limit production from the Koweit field rather than to increase it. In these circumstances the '•bird in the hand 1 * of the Anglo- /': Persian Oil Company^ offer seems to be worth s considerably more than the 'two in the bush' of the Eastern and General Syndicated draft concession. (ii) The wide experience of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in this area enables them to offer a fair economic royalty, combined with a higher minimum paymentpayment. The Eastern and General Syndicate, on the other hand, being almost entirely without local experience, offer a higher royalty and a lower minimum payment but would seen to be themselves doubtful whether the royalty which they offer is economically possiblesince their draft concession provides for a complete cessation of work for any time up to two years during which no payments would accrue to the Sheikh. 5. I am to suggest that the whole matter should now be considered by the Middle 4a.et Official Sub- Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. 6« Copies of this letter havebeen sent to foreign Office, India Office and Petroleum Department. I am, (kc., (Sd) J•S.BARNES.£ &gt;/ / tfcr SECRET. D.O.No.2 [USHIRF 'FSIDRNCK 73 1.1- JLsz^ ^ ' Political Agency, Suwait. Dated the 28th December 1932 # A t Ill Will you refer to your confidential No.916 dated the 16th December and enclosure, Admiralty letter I (/ Mo02977/32 of 18th November to the Colonial Office, on the subject of the Kuwait Oil Concession. 2. The Admiralty*s letter if I may say so is rather to the point, and largely voices my own views® 3. You remember I discussed the question with you, as to what would happen, and in whose favour the Shaikh Ir would be likely to decide (Anglo Persian Oil Company or The General -^astern Syndicate) after he receives His Majesty's Cxovernment , s final criticisms on the two draft agreements. j Presumably His Majesty's Government's final letter will take the form of a comparative statement, showing where the A.PO.C's offer is superior to that of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and vice versa. Presumably also they will not advise the Shaikh as to which of the two concessions it would be to his advantage to accept. 5. If my presumption is correct and this happens. I have the uncomfortable feeling that the Shaikh will express Iffi his gratitude and thanks to His Majesty's Government for all the trouble they have taken in his interest, to make the matter so clear, and will then proceed to give the concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate. The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R S.-2- t to 6® You may ask 'Why/the Eastern and General Syndloate, and not to the Anglo Persian Oil Company?', My reply is that the Shaikh will be influenced ^ ; to some extent by the following:- (a). His 10 years* personal friendship with Holmes; during which time he has received a hundred and one kindnesses from him in the shape of presents, advice, sympathy etc., (b). His inherent nervousness of the A.P.O^C. because of the fact that His Majesty's Government has the controlling interest* (c).* The feeling that he has not had fair dealing from His MajQsty , s Government in the matter of the Blockade and his Date Gardens© (d) # His Nejdi failing of getting as many foreign persons as possible interested in his country, as by so doing he thinks to be able to play them all off to his advantage. (This is today one of d Bin Saud's principle methods of procedure and is a typically Nejdian trait). 7* In my opinion His Majesty's Government must direct bring a certain amount of/pressure on the Shaikh else the chances are I fear about 6 to 4 on Holmes' winning the game. 8# If His Majesty's Government fears to adopt this course out of consideration for American feelings (for the life of me I do not see why they should be), then the only other way is to get the A.P.O.C. to make the financial advantages they are prepared to offer, at least 40% greater all along the line, than those of the Eastern and General Syndicate. 'Cupidity' will then come into play, and the Shaikh will I think fall to the A.P.O.C. gun. 9. At present the figures offered by the Anglo j 1 Persian Oil Company are too closely similar to those xnonEbsx-3- to those promised by the Eastern and General Syndicate, to make me feel happy. 10• As perhaps you would like to send my views to London, I am enclosing a duplicate copy of this.&amp; -iC 1 ' cui ^1$- vS j- c# 011 C0 *%, y\X&lt;- LONDON.

Questions at issue have now been discussed with other Government Jepartiaents and you may now proceed to communicate to the Sheildi of Kuwait memorandum prepared by Petroleum Department comparing the two draft concessions but in view of special posi^icn cl His Majesty's Government vis-a- vis United States Government in the matter you should not communicate the section relating to the British control clause, i.e. from TYords 'British contiol clause' to words 'passing away from a British company'. Nevertheless the Sheikh should be ade j-iilly aware, ^..e. oy oral explanation that if the concession is grai ted to the Eastern and General Syndicate it means that it will be transferred to a company controlled by foreign capital evai though nominally British and subject only to whatever measures of overriding British control may hereafter be decided upon, while concession to the -Uiglo-Persiai will ensure entire British control. It should however be made clear to the Sheikh that His i-uajesty's Government wish to leav^it or entirely to him to decide whethez^rot this circumstance affects his choice. The general observations which follow the comment on British control clause should be communicated to the Sheikh as thqf /they stand except that paragraphs 8 and 9 dealing with right of pre-emption and provision for refining oil in Kuwait should be deleted and subsequent paragraphs renumbered accordingly. Also last sentence of all commencing 'When the Sheikh has male his choice' should be deleted. As you are aware it is very desirable from the point of view of His Majesty's Government to reach a definite decision as soon as possible in view of the pressure now being brought to bear by American oil interests and it is hoped that you and the Political Agent at Kuwait will now be able to persuade the Sheildi to reach a decision between therival applicants in the light of the information containe^'in the memorandum which will be communicated to him as above. You will appreciate that it is most important in case the Sheikh decides in favour of Anglo- Persian that His uiajesty's Government should be able to avoid any suggestlai that pressure has been brought to bear upon him or that the decision is not the Sheikh's own.
