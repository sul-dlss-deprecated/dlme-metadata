Dated. r-lst F urns r, 1 133- Ahtl Dhabi , As a result of S£ r recent tour on the Trucial Coast it has been borne in on me that it mi ;ht be vise to use our renewed, friendship with Abu ihabi and the historical position of that Principality to make for ourselves a key position in Truciai tOman. 2, I should have preferred to think over the question more deeply before addressing you, but I do not like to leave it unmentioned in view of Sir Andrew Ryan’s negotiations. ?. The Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi have in the past exercised authority over the whole hinterland of Trucial ’Oman from Qatar on the west to Baraimi on the east. Their power has weakened since the death of H&amp;mdan bin Zaid and the present Shaikh (Shaikh Shakhbut) cannot by himself offer effective resistance to the infiltration of Bin Sa’ud, but he still has influence in Liwah and claims to collect a date tax and to keep an agent for that purpose in iiiwah. He still has some influence S. 6.in the rest of Dhafrah, though not, of course, comparable with that in the time of fiamdan bin Zaid. 4, I have fortunately been able to re-establish friendly relations with the Shaikh and his relations and hope to be able to consolidate them by help in connection with is desire for an artesian water supply and in other matters. a. After the signature of the air agreement on the 13th February 1935 Shaikh Xhalifah (Shaikh Shakhbut ! s uncle, an old man of great experience, who wields considerable influence with Shaikh Shakhbut) drew me aside and said that they were afraid that the 'sons of laqar” (Saqar was the late Shaikh who was killed by a lianasir tribesman) might use the grant of air facilities as an handle against tnem and might try to enlist the syii£&gt;*thy of -Sin Sa f ad (l gather that they have been in communication with Bin Sa’ud before). They asked for protection of the Government, i'his request was afterwards repeated by Shaikh Shakhbut in the presence of his relations. I made no comment but replied that I would think it over and tell you what had been said. There is, of course, an element of personalities in this, as I happen to know that Shaikh Khalifah is supposed to have arranged for the killing of Saqar. The 'sons of Sacsr' live at Sharjah and have at present no following of any strength, but they might form a useful weapon with which to threaten Abu Dhabi. 6. I am not in a position as yet to make any definitive recommendation, but think that we should bear in mind the possibility of so supporting Shaikh Shakhbut that he can gradually re-establish tne position of Abu Dhabi in the hinterland and so counter the during the present negotiations we should use the utmost caution not infiltration of Bin Sa«ud. All that 1 would urge at present is that ox ^ xruox&amp;x uoast which may have the effect of estranging Abu Dhabi ana which we may deeply regret later on when Bin Sa T ud ud dies.

Ho apology, however, was forthcoming. Sheikh during his call and he announced then that there was no tiling in the agreement about erecting a petrol store, and that he could not therefore permit it.

I arrived onshore punctually to time. Neither the Sheikhror my representative of his was present to meet me anl I was escorted to the Mejliss by one of the Isa fanilyv/ho had co'e down with rae from Sharjah and was then already ashore. 8.- I would not have waited, but for the fact that I wished tc do nothing to offend the sneikh, as it was hoped to obtiin his concurrence at the tine to the erection of a petrol store without need for any further negotiations. 9.- I waited 25 minuter; in the Mejliss before the Sheikh arrived and then with neither apology nor explanation. It was another 10 minutes before his uncle roearted when business talks commenced. The Sheikh regained adamant in his decision not t permit the builling of a petrol store. 10.- I was still not completely convinced, however, that his discourtesy was intentional until my next visit to Abu Dhabi on May 16th. 11.- I arrived there at 1045. Flight Lieutenant Coates and Lieutenant Tutton were embarked immediately and they st ted that they had informed the Sheikh about one hour previously ( when saying goodbye to him) that •FOV.’EY* was expected that forenoon. There is no question that our arrival must have been known as the Sheikh’s flag was hoisted at his fort as we approached. 12.- I had received directions from the Senior Officer Persian Gun to rebuke the Sheikh when he called for Ms behaviour on ay previous visit, but that, if he lid not come off, I was not required specially to wait. 13.- By 1400, there was no sign of his boat and though it was not necessary to sail until the evening I immediately proceeded to sea. I thought it possible that the Sheikh might be counting on my remaining until the evening and be therefore postponing his call until the cool of the day. My departure would not only thwart tMs possibility, but wcull also strengthen the charge of discourtesy against him. 14.- It appears, from the evidence of tMs latter visit, that his conduct on both occasions was deliberately scornful.

U.S. Sealed.13th Febraury 1935« After the P.A. left for the ship, Ahmad bin f Utaibah told me that Shaikh Khalifah had asked him to make tne following request to P.A. That although he is on a very good terms with Shaikh Shakhbut and has no reason to think of any trouble between him and his nephews, the sons of Sultan, he is afraid that after his death or the aeath of his nephew Shakhbut, some of his nephews mignt try to create trouble for his son Muhammad or his grandsons. He(Khalifa) wants to have the protection from the Government against any trouble which might be created against him or his son after the aeath of Shakhbut. Ahmad bin ’Utaibah said that Shaikn knslifah was the actual Ruler of Abu Dhabi,as it was he who sent for Shakhbut and that his word is listenea to by all his nephews who are now at Abu Dhabi, but that he was afraid lest trouble might be createu for his son after the death of Shakhbut and has therefore made this revest in order that he may take shelter under the Government whenever he or his sons are in trouble# 2. Ahmad bin T Utaibah said that as he was a merchant ana very friendly with the Shaikh who listens to him, he was afraid thit some-one, afterwards, might create trouble for him among the rulers of Abu Dhabi and wants the nelp of the Government whenever he is in need for it. He wants these two matters to be kept secret from others. He also said that Shaikh Khalifah insisted on him to make this request to you. I told him that I will inform the P.A. accordingly# 13.2.1935. ZOOl13th February 1935* After the agreement the Shaikh, his brothers and uncle all asked for the protection of the Government against any trouble which others might create* They said that the sons of Saqr who are now at Sharjah might attempt to stir trouble or instigate the bedouins against them. Shaikh Khalifah said that his nephews might ask the help of Bin Sa’ud against Shakhbut and that although no trouble has so far been created for tnem by Bin Sa f ud, besides the incident about which he informed P.A* during his last visit, his nephews went to Bin ^a f ud once before to seek his nelp# That having given these facilities to the Goverhment.many people will feel jealous and will try to create trouble for them. P.A. said that he will think over the matter and will speak to the Honourable the P.R. who will shortly be coming to Bahrain. 13.2.1935. S.No:l.

P.A V No:5. setter dated 20/5/1935 from Officer Lomending O C'./ pon»ersatLjn &gt;vhieh took place on board H # M.S # Fowey between the Political Agent,Bahrain and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi-! on &lt;)th June 1335* After usual compliments and polite conversation, refreshments ana coffee, P*A* informed the Shaikh that he wished to speak to him on a riv&amp;te matter and had a letter to deliver to him from the Honourable the Political Resident# The P*A* asked the Shaikh if he wished his relatives to retire# The Shaikh replied 'No**. P*A* then delivered the Honourable the Political Resident's letter No#C/199 dated 6th June 1935. As Shaikh had difficulty in reading It Khan Sahib Saiyid f Abdur H&amp;azaq ®ead it to him* The Shaikh at first became reflective and then showed annoyance# Before, however, he could make any remarks, which, from his appearance and attitude, seemed like to be offensive, the P.A# delivered the Honourab e the Political Residents second letter in the hope that the Shaikh would realise that he had caused considerable annoyance to His Maj sty*s Ships. After pointing out the Honour that His Majesty permits his ships to show him oy according him a salute the P.A. appv:aled to the Shaikh to realise that he should have appreciated this by being punctilious both in calling and receiving calls- and that his discourtesy on three recent consecutive occasions to His Mjaesty^ Ship ^owey' deserved some expression of regret. The Shaikh then lost his temper and harped on the Political Resident's first letter concerning a light and beacon, and made no reference to the subject of calls# He said that he was undeserving of a threatening letter and had come off to H.M.S.Fowey in expectation of a Robe of Honour (Kha'ah)# Instead, however, when he was most helpful, the P.A* brought him &amp; letter containing tnreats and that if this was the way His Britannic Majesty's Government treated him (here slapping his hands) he had no more to say* The P.A* reminded the Shaikh that he had iven his ritten consent to the construction of a petrol Store and beacon, and that there was no further use in discussing the consequences if he had not done so and that ail trial now remained «as for him to eatpress his regret to Commander Harvey for his past possible unintentional lack of cou tesy and that thereafter the former ha, py re lations between us all would be restored* The Shaikh replied that he had always kept His Majesty's Ships waiting before without complaint and that he saw no reason to later this habit in future and that he would come off to ships at his convenience* P?A# then asked Shaikh why he had kept Commamer Harvey waiting for half an hour when returning his call at a prearranged time during a visit of His Majesty's ship 'Fowey' on knd May 1935* This was not a question of keeping a ship waiting but a matter of ordinary manners and hospitality to a guest. In reply the Shaikh said that he was ill( &amp; fact that carried no conviction since were he really ill, he ;ould have sent a message to that effect to Coomander Harvey- as is usually done by other Shaikhs), The Shaikh continued in this attitude and refused to express regret to Commander Harvey.
