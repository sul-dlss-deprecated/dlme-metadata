The old Postmaster here, Zafar Hussein, has implored my help so that 'he may not be in trouble' as the result of the last inspection note recorded on the 25th eianuary 1939 by the Inspector of Post offices, Persian Gulf Section. T dare say it is wrong for him to do so and for me to write on his behalf, buu, as you know, there are rather special rela tions between the Agency and the Post Office here, which hitherto has been in part of the Agency buildings. 3. I must say that I feel that the Inspector has been very unfair to Zafar Hussein. The latter has had a good record so far, judging by remarks in the Inspection Book, and the fact is that he has been seriously overworked, and quite/- K. W. Spear, Ksquire, Assistant Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Karachi- 2 - l \ quite frankly I thought he would have a complete breakdown last summer. He only has one clerk, the assistance which he gets from his packer and postmen being of no vast value, and it has been recognised that the Post Office requires two addi tional clerks. The building he works in has been described as more like a Jail than a post office, and of course climatic conditions are dreadful in the summer. If therefore depart mental rules and regulations are not fully carried out at all times it is hardly a matter for surprise. ?afar Hussein has at least managed to retain the good will of the local public, and I do feel that instead of harsh comments on his work, he might well have a pat on the back and a spell of leave. 4. Please forgive me for what may appear to be unwarranted interference but I feel it is only fair to say something on behalf of an oldish man who has worked very loyally here for many years.

A Customs Appraiser attends at the Postoffice regularly on the days when parcels are issued to the public for the collection of dues on such imports; this officer also inspects the packages where necessary. At the Agency Postoffice where the space was very restricted, this work had perforce to be done on the verandah outside the building. At the new Postoffice this work has still to be done outside the building on the back verandah; and this important work becomes unusually difficult on account of the general public crowding around and impeding the collection of cash and the inspection of contents. I do not consider it at all fitting that the contents of an importer^ parcel should have to be exposed to the idle curiosity of the general public; nor is it suitable that cash should be so exposed. There is one room in the Postoffiee (formerly the Passport Office) which affords ample accommodation for this work to be carried out quickly and privately. This room is now unused by the staff. if permission could be granted for the Customs Appraiser to do his work in this room, through one of the windows, I feel sure that this would be greatly appreciated by the public as well as the officials concerned, please.

I understand from the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain, that the work of inspecting parcels and packages by Customs officials is done on the back verandah of the new Post office. The Director of Customs considers, and I agree with him, that it is most undesirable that this work should be done in the public view. 2. I am informed that there is a room in the Post office, which was formerly used as the Passport office, in which this work could, be done privately and if there is no objection this room may please be used la future for this work.

I understand that the Sub-Postmaster desires to reserve the room in question for the storage of records at some future date; but there is a further smaller room leading from this, which would be suitable for Customs purposes if the Sub-Postmaster would permit the Customs Appraiser to have access to same during official hours only # The items of office/ furniture provided by the Customs could remain in this small room; and there could, of course, be no intrusion or interference in Post Office business by the Customs Appraiser. If the Sub-Postmaster could kindly afford this facility, it will be clearly understood that this permission (for at least two days in each week) does not in any way eonsitutufee a right to use the room, please. and PORT OFFICER.

It is clearly up to the Postal Authorities to provide a proper place inside the post office where the customs work can be carried on* The present position of the official being made to work in the verandah cannot continue, and the altemativt of sending all mail baefc to Customs inspection to the Customs House is both inconvenient and objectionable. 3. As you have agreed that this small room could be used for this purpose without inconvenience to you( the customs appraiser would use it only twice a week) X request you to permit its use for this work at once. 4.

I did not know anything about this until I received a letter after some time from the pleader stating that he has not receivec the papers and asking me to send them as soon as possible. I wrote to Muhamad ^harif Ahraedi who replied that he despatched the letter on the date mentioned above and that he had discussed the matter with the Postmaster who has asked him to give him time so that he may make enquiries from the Bushire Post Office. The Bushire Post Office’s reply was that they had returned the letter to Bahrain. Thereafter the Postmaster said that on enquiry it has been ascertained that the letter has been delivered to a man named Ibrahim. I personally wrote a letter to the Post master, copy of which is enclosed for your information, but he did not send me an answer. I asked Haji *usuf Pakhro to apeak about this matter to the Postmaster, but the latter when the matter was referred to him, did not pay any attention and his reply was that he has delivered the letter to Ibrahim. I forw©d herewith copy of a letter from the Bushire Post Office for your i nformation. £31 The letter which ± sent to Bushire contained documents and deeds to the value of Rs.97000/-. I ber^o look into this matter and order the Postmaster to produce the letter with its enclosure and to deliver it to Muhamad S ha , if Ahmeai as he ^ (Muhd . shar . f) has posted it in Bahrain and is in possession of the receipt.

I beg to state that on the 3rd December 1938 I sent a letter to the Bushire Court through Haji Mihamad Sharif Ahmedi and go. who sent it as a registered letter with acknowledgment receipt. As the acknowledgment was not received the Bushire Court (Post Office?) who was addressed on the subject replied that the letter was returned by the Court to Bahrain. On enquiry from Haj i %hamad Bharif he informed me that on referring the matter to you you told him verbally that the letter in question was taken by a certain Ibrahim. It is not right that a letter should be delivered to a stranger and not to the real owner. Haji Mihamad ^harif is a well known person. The letter contained valuable documents. I request you to make enquiries and return the letter to Haji Muhamad Bharif. The post office is responsible for it.

From The Postmaster, Bahrain, ^ent, Ba! To sir i# rith your No.73-14/1 dated 11/1/40, I beg to bubiiiWUierewith the statements dated 21/1/40 and 24/1/40 of Mr.Rajabali, the Registration Clerk, along with the two documents for Rs.65690/- and Rs.28118/- respectively and a letter from Mr.Ibrahim Hasan Galadari, Dubai, to Bushire. The statements of Mr.Rajabali will speak for themselves. In this concern, T beg to report that that a gentle man named Mohamed Sharif Ahmedi had enquired of me verbally and also written me a letter about the regd. letter in question, said to have been sent by Ibrahim Hasan Galadari, from Dubai. I had replied him verbally and also written him a letter (vide my • /fates' &amp;/ 7 - 1 ,/). So far I remember, Ibrahim Hasan Galladari himself did not write to me any letter about the aforesaid regd. letter; of course, Mr.Housuf Fakhroo, had sent a man down to the Post Office in connection with this matter, to whom the receipt of the regd. letter in question was shown. It appears that the said regd. letter was brought to the Post Office for booking by an unknown person and the same, on having been returned 'as refused by the addressee' from Bushire, was delivered by Mf.Kajabali, Registration Clerk, to a man by name Ibrahim Galladari of Bahrain. Had the name of Mr.Mohamed Sharif Ahmedi, Bahrain, been written over the said regd. letter, the same could have easily been delivered to him. Moreover, owing to short staff, Mr.Rajabali, having been in-Charge of two branches (i.e. Registration and Parcel), was rushed in those days. The regd. letter in question might have been misdelivered by him owing to the insufficient address of the sender. The matter was also brought to the notice of the Inspector of Post Offices, when he visited Bahrain this month, in the presence of Mr. Mohamed Sharif Ahmedi, Bahrain, from whom he made some verbal enquiries, and the receipt of the regd. letter in question was also shown to him. As Mohamed Sharif’s name was neither written on the regd. letter nor on the receipt of the said article, he did not take up the matter. However, the sender who claimed to have sent the said regd. letter resides at Dubai. The Inspector did not give so much importance to this case. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, Enclos. a? AJBanraxn, 2lst January 1940 To The Post Master, BAHRAIN . Sir, RE: COMPLAINT 0P_LBxM^Im GHL^aLAMT aGAIImST BAHRAIN P.0. I wish to bring to your Kind, notice the following facts con nected with the above case;- Buring 1938, someone brought a letter addressed to the Persian Court at Bushire, Persia and washed to have this cover registered. On the cosrer of this, the sender* s name was H Ebranim Gelled ary, Bahr ain* 1 only. A few days later, on the 13th December 1938, this letter was returned from Bushire as the addressee had refused to tane delivery. When this cover was received by us, the usual receipt was prepared in the name oi the sender, Bbrahim Gelledary, and given to Postman for window delivery. The receipt was delivered at the window and the cover handed over after the receipt was signed by M Ebranim**. There.were no marks or indications on this cover to show the Bender to be care oi Haji Mod. Sheriff Ahmedi, but the name 'Ebranim Gelledary** only on it. Such a long time has since passed that it is impossible for me to remember who took delivery oi * the cover, but it is obvious that the man who brought the letter for registration in the first instance, took delivery when the cover was returned from Bushire. I wash to draw your kind attention to the fact many Iranians send covers from here to Persia and owing to surcharged stamps, tnese covers are very often refused by the addressee and are re turned and althogh the Senders are aware of^this, yet they p&amp;E&amp;xjs persist in sending such unspecified covers to Persia.

The local Sub-Postmaster in this case has demanded and collected excess postage of 2 -§- annas on the grounds that the postage was not stamped in India with Indian postal stamps, and that such a reply-postcard can be current only within the State of Bahrain (where there is no postal service), in view of the fact that the Indian stamp is surcharged with the word ’Bahrain*. This point is of interest as a matter of ppinciple, because a non-surcharged Indian postal stamp cannot be bought in Bahrain; and if the Sub-Postmaster is correct in his position it implies that this perfectly normal method of communication cannot be used in Bahrain. I should be much obliged if this point may be kindly submitted to the proper Authority for favour of a regular decision, since a question of principle is involved, please.

Postmaster without consulting P.A. had started his summer hours as from 9 a.m. to 1 p.ra. and 3.p.m. to 4 p.m. I think it was C.L.R. who had reported that these hours were incon^snient when P.A. wrote the letter at page 151. The postmaster however, / vide page 167, would not agree to follow the hours until, he said, he received instructions from Karachi. He said tiat he had sent P.A’s letter in original to his Head Office at Karachi. I informed P.A. of this vide page 3.

He better follow the hours ordered by his own department. Since he has not put up the matter in writing, if you approve, I may return the papers and tell him that he may follow his head**office instructions.

One is meant for 'inland use' and the other for international use. The inland reply postcards can be used only in the country of issue. No doubt the Sahrain pb\st office as far as postage rates etc are concerned is considered 'inland' i.e. included in India, but since tide stamps issued at Bahrain are surcharged^ it distinctly implies t-tet tnes-e-sui^har^cd stamps •ml pootcards implyinimtL that Bahrain is an Independent State. Thus I think Postmaster is correct in charging the extra fee. It is no fault of the postmaster if tnere are no other post offices in Bahrain to enable the public to use surcharged reply-post cards.

It appears that the postmaster snsw anticipaoed a shortage in postage stamps on 9th February, enu 1 tnink he could have easily managed to ■get the stamps by one of the following boats:- 3.S.Pronto arrived here 25th February.

I think in such cases postmaster should not refuse the mails, but should send them to his office at Karachi in a. postal bag where the stamps e:c could be affixed. fhe postmaster is silent on the subject of shortage of postal orders. P.U.C. 94 .

Draft reply for approval. P.U.C. 95 . It is beyond me to discuss the possibility h£ and advisibility of transport of mails to and from India by the American tankers. It is also not known whether the tankers in question will be in a position to call at the various ports for mails, and whether the Bahrain Petroleum Co. will be willing, for the sake of delivery of our mails, to instruct the tankers to alter their routes. The Agreement with the B.I.S.N.Co., for transport of mails in the Gulf must be with P.R., and I think a reference to the Government of India would be necessary if any alteration in the agreement is contemplated. In any case we can do nothing/if the Co. give an assurance that their tankers will call at all the ports in the Gulf for mails, and P.R. considers such a procedure advisable and agrees to take up the matter with the G.of I. In any case it is no fault of the B.I.S.N.Co., if the boats are irregular because I think it is in the interests of the public service. P.U.C. 96.
