I regret that owing to absence from Headquarters my diaries have recently been irregular. The most important local matters which have been under consideration have been revenue matters in Sistan, the provision of transport for exporting Sistan produce to the main line of communications, and the reopening of trade - in imports from India. Revenue matters in Sistan. —Some six years ago the Majlis passed a law whereby villages in Sistan were, without respect of persons or president, to be leased for short terms of years to the bidder offering the largest sum in cash and in kind. The whole of Sistan is held to he a Government property, and the law extended to all Government properties in Persia. The operation of the law appears for some years to have extended chiefly to districts near Tehran, holders of land in Sistan continuing to pay revenue approximately the basis laid down at the settlement of 1903 before which the whole on country had been leased to the then Governor for some 2 4,000 Tabriz Kharwars (1 Kharwar=about 8 maunds Indian) of grain a year, out of which the value of some 14,000 Rharwars was payable in Tehran the remainder being kept by him to defray local expenses. The 'present Revenue Director in Sistan, Shahzada Ibtehaj-us-Sultan, acting under strict directions from Tehran, has recently been attempting to enforce a hard and fast system of adjudication to the highest bidder in the case of leases which have fallen in. The result is that many Kadkhudas whose families have held a village for generations now find themselves dispossessed of their title, and in the ignominous position of having either to seek a new home or else stay on in their villages without means- of subsistence and in a position of inferiority to new lease-holders whom they regard as upstarts. The sufferers include several influential Mullahs, i Their resentment is naturally focussed against the present Revenue Director, and in spite of discouragement many Mullahs and others of good family have taken bast at the Consulate. Their main demands are that the present Revenue Director should be removed and that their lands should be formally assessed to the payment of such revenue in cash and in kind as can fairly be expected by the State. The bast, which has now lasted over a fortnight, is irksome, but at present the cc bastis ” show no inclination to leave. Export of Sistan produce to line of communications. —This has recently been the subject of discussion between the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, the General Officer Commanding the 4th Quetta Division, the Inspecter General, Lines of Communications and myself. In order to expedite matters I visited Birjand, and Major D. Heron, C.I.E., I.M S., Vice-Consul at Sistan, kindly undertook to go to Quetta. The demand for transport for these exports is about double what has hitherto been available. The almost complete shutting down of trade which was enforced last autumn has not met the situation, and the view now preva lent is that the only way of meeting it is to attract more camels to the country. Sistan being an area liable to Surra there is objection, in addition to the difficulty of sparing them from India, to sending a large number of Govern ment camels to Sistan to do the work. The system which is now being introduced is to make use of the available short-distance transport, chiefly donkeys, to carry produce from outlying villages to 3 or 4 collecting centres in Sistan, and to encourage traders, who are in touch with camelmen in many directions, to do all they can to increase the local camel supply by giving them to understand that, so long as certain definite Government needs are met, there shall be freedom to import goods from India. It is hoped that this incentive w r ill be sufficiently strong to produce the desired effect. There are /ce il «u I I mmmKS2 thousands of maunds of trade goods lying at railhead, which were bought by the merchants several months ago, and on which the owners are losing interest. Reopening of import trade from India. —Apart from the aspect of the import trade as a means to a military end, it is most important that Indian r trade should obtain a firmer hold than before in East Persia at a time when the demand is abnormally brisk. The demand is due to recent restriction of ’ trade from the South, stoppage of trade from the North, general prosperity due to the presence of our troops, and the fact that the Kran, which three years ago stood at 420 = Rs. 100, is now welcomed at the banks at less than Krans 200 = Rs. 100. The Managers of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Sistan and Birjand anticipate that a revival of trade will at once tend to bring more Krans into the banks in payment for drafts on India which besides relieving the present anxiety as to securing enough Krans for local military payments at any cost may tend to considerable economies by affecting the general rate of exchange. Crop prospects in the Kainat are good owing to recent rain. They are also good in Sistan. It is hoped that this year it will be possible to induce the cultivators in Sistan to cut more of their straw than usual the traditional method being to harvest only the upper half of the straw, or even less in outlying places. M. Cordennier, the Belgian Director of Customs, Sistan, has been instruct ed to take steps for opening a customs post at Duzdap. The post of Koh Malik Siah is, however, likely to be maintained for some time. All classes express great satisfaction at the prospect of the railway soon reaching Duzdap, but are genuinely disappointed at hearing that it is not to be pushed on to Neh. Equal satisfaction is expressed at the construction of the road, for work on which the Sistan Levy Corps has been warmly commended by the Inspector-General, Communications. Peksonnel.

It is reported that two men, recently released from this Consulate where they were imprisoned as suspected German agents and given Rahdarie to return to their homes in Yezd {Dy. No. 46, oj 1918) have gone to Herat with a view to rejoining the Germans there..3. The Governor of Chakhansur is touring his district and warning his subordinates to be prepared in the event of outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Afghanistan. Two of the above mentioned Germans are said to have accompanied the Governor to Rudbar. 4. See Diary No. 51 of 1918. It is said that Kadkhuda Mirak has been released by the Governor of Chakhansur on his presenting the latter with 9,000 Krans. A later report says that Mirak has recommenced raiding and recently carried away 12 camels with their loads belong to Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai of Sarhad while returning from Kala-i-Eath where the Sardar had sent them for wheat. The former is said to have retained some of the loot and to have sent the balance to Chakhansur. 5. A report from Chakhansur says information has been received from Kabul that Sardar Haji Sherdil Khan is being sent to -replace Sardar Gul Muhammad Khan as Governor of Chakhansur as a result of numerous, com plaints against thfe latter for oppression and extortion. 6. It is rumoured that the Germans and Turks at Herat are being permitted to return to their homes and have been given money for their journey. 7. The Russians who recently arrived at Herat are said to have been in vited to Kabul and to have accepted the invitation. Afghan Robbers. 1. An Afghan caravan of some 60 camels returning from Quetta to Afghanistan with trade goods was attacked near Kala-i-Kang by a band of robbers who killed two of the camel men and carried off the goods. 2. Two postal runners carrying mails to Chakhansur from Kabul were recently set upon and murdered between Farah and Chakhansur, while their packages were rifled and burnt. The crime was reported to the Governor, who is making enquiries. B. J, GOULD, H. B. M's Consul, for^Sistan and Kain. IQPI Delhi—860 F&amp;Pl&gt;i-17-2.1^-30.- CONFIDENTIAL. :$ n ^ &amp;,'1 i jr\ 13 .

The Kadkhudas who took bast at the Consulate still remain here and are apparently confident that their voluntary internment will, by forcing the attention of the Persian Government to revenue matters in Sistan, amply compensate them for any present discomfort. They are behaving well and at my suggestion ordered a mob of adherents to desist from their intention of joining them in bast. The Kadkhudas are pleased at the views that the present Revenue Director, Ibtihaj us Sultan, is to be replaced by Basir us Saltaneh who was here in the same capacity in 1917, but, being determined to obtain the introduction of some reasonable revenue system, are not contented with a mere change in personnel. The Karguzar is dealing with the situation tactfully. Good rain has given prospects of good harvests in Sistan and Kain. M. Cordonnier, the Director of Customs, Sistan, promises his cordial support in any arrangement for the re-opening of trade on such terms as shall promote military interests. Our future requirements in the way of Levies are being scrutinised. News from Afghanistan. 1. A report, contrary to that mentioned in Diary No. 1, has been received to the effect that the appointment of Sherdil Khan to the Governorship of Chakhansur has been cancelled and that another official, Mahomed Zafar Khan, son of Mahomed Akbar Khan of Jalalabad, has left Kabul for this appointment accompanied by the Chakhansur vakils and 50 sowars with a big gun. 2. A Mahomedzai, said to be a relative of Sardar Gul Mahomed Khan, is reported to have recently made an attempt on the life of the Amir who has, however, forgiven the man on Gul Mahomed’s account. 3. A party of Afghan Durohis who went to Mian Kangi to buy wheat were attacked, while returning with their purchases, by a band of Afghan robbers near Atish Khaneh. Two of the robbers are said to have been killed in the fight that ensued. No casualties occurred among the former who continued their journey unmolested to Julga Sunni Khaneh. 4. It is said that all the Germans, Austrians and Turks have left Herat for Bokhara. Influenza. The disease seems to show no sign of subsiding; on the contrary its effects ^ have lately been very severe at Dehaneh . Baghi where many deaths have occurred among both regulars and levies. B. J.

Khorasan and North-East Persia. 397. British force. —No moves of importance from Meshed. Trans-Caspian front. —On the night of the 7th-8th instant the advanced Trans-Caspian troops attacked the enemy positions at Ravnina and occupied that station, bombing the Bolshevik armoured train. The operation seems to have been successful but the Trans-Caspians subsequently retired to their former position. There appears to have been lack of cohesion. No further operations are reported. Yesterday the enemy aeroplane made a reconnaissance flight over the Trans-Caspian armoured trains. 398. - Provinces. —The present governor of Persian Sarakhs, Shajji-as- Saltanah, is being replaced by Mutamid ul Wuzara from Darajiz, where he has recently worked in our interests. The vicinity of Astrabad remains unsettled although some improvement is noted. Two platoons of the 6th Gurkhas are being sent to Bandar-i-Gaz in con nection with unrest among the Turkoman in that region. Herat and Afghanistan. 399. Germans and adherents. —No further intelligence of Kazim Beg and Barakatullah. The two Austrians at Herat appear to have deferred their departure. 400. Befugees. —The Russian converts to Islam were expected to start shortly for Kabul. One of them has been joined by his wife. 401. Military affairs. —Little seems to be going on. The Naib Salar has discovered that pay is being drawn for soldiers who only exist on paper and is taking steps in consequence. He has enforced stricter rules for night patrolling with a view to prevention of thefts in the city. Artillery horses are being trained. One of the recently arrived instructors from Kabul is reported to have said that in view of the progress made by the Herat troops there is little for him to do. 402. Afghan attitude. —The Naib Salar is parting with his illusions with difficulty. In the end he thought that the separation of the Arabs from the Turks might have contributed to the defeat of the latter, but until quite recently he considered the surrender of Germany unthinkable. In this opinion his officers, either from conviction or complaisance, were at one with him. They have now received intelligence from Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan at Chihil Dukhtaran, obtained the Lord knows where, which appears to have left them no further room for hope. The Naib Salar derives some comfort from a nevs sheet printed on tl in paper (previously mentioned but not as yet identified) which be receives from Kabul and which our agent imagines to hail from India, but which is very jealously guarded. The Naib-ul- Hukumah has told him to put no faith in the news contained therein. A society styled “ Patriots and Protectors of Islam ” composed of clerks, students and shop-keepers, and apparently somewhat on the lines of the Persian democrats, exists at Herat. These worthies affect to disbelieve the British bulletins, stating that such an uninterrupted course of success is im possible, and they propose to submit specimens to Muhammad Tarzi for his criticism.

Transcaspian front. —Beyond observation of an enemy aeroplane nothing of interest has occurred during the week. A Russian machine-gun detachment with 4 Lewis guns left for Askhabad last week after training at Meshed. A small Russian cavalry detachment will leave to-morrow for the same destination. 405. Brovinces. —With the exception of continued unrest at Astrabad all is reported quiet. There is ground for suspicion that the intrigues against the Governor may be engineered from Bujnurd as the Sardar is reputed to desire the Governorship of Astrabad. A short time ago the democrats of Shahrud protested against the distribu tion there of our war communiques and in other ways made their anti-English bias apparent. A remarkable change has now manifested itself in our favour. The intrigues of Aziz Khan in the neighbourhood of Russian Sarakhs may have an unsettling effect on the border should his action precipitate active hostili ties between Turkoman sections. His representative has now usurped power in the Russia settlement but no actual disturbance has yet been reported. Arrivals from Baku have convinced the local Caucasian community that the Turks have evacuated Baku, but still inform them that they are at Bala- jari. Hopes from the Turks themselves have now been abandoned and the only drop of comfort that remains is the possibility of the Azerbaijan republic among whose ranks a number of Turkish soldiers and officers are thought to have enrolled themselves, asserting itself. The local Caucasian community continues to receive information from both the Transcaspian, and Bolshevik ranks in Transcaspia, and as far as it is possible to judge their sympathies are with the latter. Herat and Afghanistan. ^ I 1 406. Germans and adherents. —Von Gruden appears to have lapsed into debauchery, though he still makes fruitless efforts to contradict our communi ques. No news of the progress of Kazim Beg and party has reached Herat. 407. Military affairs. —The Artillery and Infantry have been carrying out field exercises in the Maulvi Jam hills. Some 90 transport animals are to be purchased to replace those sent to Kabul with the Russian party. 408. Frontier. —The Naib Salar is reported to have issued a farman enjoining increased strictness in the performance of their duties by the frontier guards. Strangers are not to be permitted to enter Afghan territory and greater vigilance in checking smuggling is to be exercised. Wealthy inhabi tants are not to be permitted to reside within 6 miles of the frontier line. 409. Jamshadis. —The release of Sayyid Ahmad Beg is reported and he is reputed to be about to collect his fribe and bring them into Afghanistan. Some raiding between Jamshadis and IJazaras on the Afghan border has occurred. ? - .j- m f * PC inn? ^ ▼ A . • 4 i vo£.V- 4 iv.jf. 10 ® | 5 FEB1£i9 f 11 f:1AR?3?3 I ' 12 Russian Turkistan 410. Current -Affairs at Askhabad are for the time being some what improved. The lower class liussians who number many Bolshevik sympathisers among them, the Armenians, and Caucasian Turks remain an ele ment of potential trouble and disorder. Aziz Khan’s rebellious action, although unimportant in itself, has the makings of serious trouble if various Turkoman sections and border Afghans should become involved. Prom the report of apparently reliable arrivals from Tashkent the Bolshe vik position is none too strong and prospects of a rising against them are increased. Their actual force at Tashkent is from this source said to be 900 only. They are having trouble with the brigand bands of Perghana and are hard hit by the shortage of oil. On the other hand, they recently telegraphed that the coal mines (probably those at Kizil Ki in Perghana) are working and the fuel difficulty is lessened. According to an unconfirmed report they have seized Petro-Alexandrovsk. The last news of this place was that the armed Russian element there, about ! *A German Red Cross Mission has reached Askhabad from Baku, and an Austrian Mission, both being concerned with the repatriation of prisoners, is about to proceed to Askhabad. 500 strong were ready to turn against the Bolsheviks if given sufficient encour agement. 2Ut December 1918 SGrPI Delhi— 557 C G S- 29 -l* 19 - 4 S Meshed E.

It appears very possible that Turko-German plans may have included some such adventure in the South-East Caspian region, and that on their collapse Salar has decided to play a lone hand.

Persian officials —The intrigues against the Governor-General mentioned in paragraph 3 last week are unfortunately not at an end, and it seems possible that he may have to go. It appears that the Shah wished, in spite of the Kawwam’s refusal, to send him to Azarbaijan and to appoint to Khorasan the Sipah Salar Azam, who had already been nominated to Azarbaijan. The Kawwam has now telegraphed to Tehran positively declining in any case to accept the transfer proposed, and adding that if His Majesty insisted on his return to Tehran he was ready to obey his orders. He informed me on the 19th instant that the appointment of the Nusrat-us-Saltanah, who had intrigued against him some mouths ago, and who gave us so much trouble while Governor-General of the Kirman Province recently, was now contemplated ; and in view of this man’s British attitude I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister begging that in any case his coming may be prevented. Meanwhile the removal of the Kawwam has not been decided upon, and the Aghazadah and other leading Mujtahids have joined their efforts to ours to prevent the catastrophe by representing to Tehran how much our friend has done to keep order in the province and to rectify the many and serious mistakes made by his predecessor. 2. Complaints have reached us against the Chief of Bujnurd, Major Daukes telegraphs to the Military Mission that he has come to the conclusion that the Chief is responsible for the unrest prevailing at present among the Turkomans on both sides of the border to the north-w est of Khorasan. This is extremely likely to be the case, as the Chief was disappointed some months ago at the collapse of a scheme he had formed to effect the junction to his government of that of Astarabad : and he probably thinks now that the best way to bring about the desired change is to ferment unrest in the Astarabad region. The Governor-General, in response to our representations, is con templating measures that wdll bring the Chief to his senses. The latter has always; been too independent, and hitherto no Governor-General seems to have been strong enough to deal with his pretensions. 3. Persian affairs (local). —The first meeting of prominent townspeople for the consideration of the measures to he taken in connection with the local elections for the National Assembly, which included members of various societies, w r as held during the week at the house of Haji Rais Daftar, son of Agha Kaim Mukam. It was announced that the villages within twelve miles of the city were to be included in the Meshed division, and arranged that the voters from outside should be brought in on the day or days appointed for the ballot. 4. Persian affairs (general). —The Sirdar Intisar, who as already reported is on a visit to Sarakhs, has asked the Governor-General to send up a further reinforcement, as he fears an attack by Turkomans upon Persian Sarakhs. Two hundred and fifty more men are to go at once, on the understanding that without our sanction they will not cross the border. They are also to be sup plied with British rifles and ammunition, 5 Some of the robbers mentioned in paragraph 8 of last week’s Diary as having been allow ed to escape from custody have been recaptured, and are being conveyed to Nishapur. 6. British affairs — Major-General Malleson has returned from Askabad ; and on the 16th instant Brigadier-General Dickson arrived from Birjand in company with Lieutenant-Colonel M. Synge, who leaves for Askabad to-day. Lieutenant-Colonel Hawley, 28th Light Cavalry, has left Meshed for Askabad en route for Bairam Ali. 7. The past week has been largely occupied by Armistice celebrations. On the 15th some 2,500 poor were fed in the Consulate premises, and on the following day His Highness the Governor-General with the chief officials and a few selected Persian friends were entertained at dinner. On the 17th a general reception was held in the afternoon which was largely aft'gh'ded, and o 4J £9 JAU U13 *8.

The conduct of these men while in Meshed has been good in so far as that no complaints of importance have been made against them by the Persian authorities or people of the city. 9. M. Guerra, the Manager of the local branch of the Russian hank, has again asked for my assistance in helping him to recover the i na ^y &gt; debts due by Persians of consequence, and I am examining the claims unofficially with a view to render assistance to the extent that may be advisable. 10. Persian and German Complaints have reached us in connection with the attitude of the assistant Karguzar of Kmce.an, who is^ said to be influencing his chief and causing him to assume an -British position. The local revenue officer in Kuchan is said to have bought from Haji Riza Khan, the chief of the local government sowars, a rifle of our military pattern which is reported to have 'been purchased from Turkomans for tumans^ 90. Further enquiries will be made into this. No reports of democrat meetings have vet been received this week. # 11„ News from Turbat-i-Baidari.—bL Maximoff, the Russian Vice-Consul, is under orders from Tehran to proceed to Russia, and there is a question regard ing his successor. As M. de Beauvais is on the spot it seems to be natural that he should assume charge during the absence of his colleague which is said to be for a time only, but M. Nicolsky is vigorously opposing this and would prefer to see de Beauvais removed altogether from the service. Meanwhile I have been approached by M. Bulatoff through his wife with a request that I will do my best to have de Beauvais appointed, as otherwise he w r ould have to fill the vacancy. The matter is still under discussion with Tehran, but l have pointed out to M. Bulatoff that I have little to do with the appointment of Russian officials. 12. News from Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam. —The party mentioned in paragraph 18 last week in the course of their search for the Afghan robbers fell in with the Ilbaigi Kaudani’s men with whom they exchanged some shots before the object of the expedition was discovered. It subsequently transpired that the Ilbaigi was not concerned in the outrage under investigation. Property of the value of tumans 7,000 has been attached under orders from Meshed, pending the payment of revenue due by Mir Baki Sultan. 13. News from Karaiz. —The Barbari, Saiyid Asaf, has returned to Kalaii- darabad by order of his chief, Saiyid Murtaza (paragraph 16 last week). 14 News from Herat.-' The Governor of Sabzawar has sent in to Herat two thieves caught in the act of committing a robbery. They have been handed over to the Kotwal for disposal. 15. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has instructed the Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan to prevent the raids into Afghan territory of Jamshidis from across the Russian border which have been somewhat frequent of late. 16. von Gruden has been chided by the Naib-ul-Hukumah for loose living in which he is supposed to indulge. 17. von Gruden continues to deny the truth of our communiques, but he received on the 16th instant a letter from his compatriots at Kabul which seems to have convinced him of the end of the war.

Early in the week protests against the proposed change (paragraph 1 last week) were despatched to Tehran by all e local bodies and societies, and the unanimity displayed in the matter was quite remarkable. It was partly the result of the attitude adopted by our selves, and partly due to the success that has attended the Kawwam’s work in the province m respect of the many robber bands with which it was infested. W a , te i e f am from Hi s Majesty’s Minister announc ing that the Shah had undertaken to revoke the order for the Kawwam to re urn to Tehran, and His Highness received a communication to that effect from his brother at the same time. That evening the Shrine was illuminated and general rejoicing took place: and the Governor-General asked me to h^hthJf 0 T? hran and Mia his thanks for the action that had been taken on s behalf mth an assurance that he would worK for us even more cordially and whole-heartedly in the future. ^tuiany 2.

The police worked well on this occasion, as did our own men. 8 Russian affairs.-A meeting has been held in the office of the Amid-us- Saltanah Chief Secretary to the Governor-General, which was attended by all heads ol departments, to consider the question of the amount of conipensatimi to be claimed from the Russian Government on account of loss and dama 0 e suffered by Khorassan, and the Khorassanis at the hands of the Russians during their military occupation of the province. The claims of some districts have not yet come in and will he submitted later to Tehran, b ^t the total agieed upon by the meeting amounted to ii69,000 tumans, of which 240,000 are for iniury to the Shrine on the occasion of the bombardment in 1912. A number of firearms are also claimed, hut their total has not jet been ascertained. 9. Persian and German intrigues .—(This title will in future be “ Demo cratic and other intrigues ; \) Two secret meetings of the democrat society were held during the week under report. At the first the conversation opened with an allusion to the Peace Conference about to assemble m Europe, and the chances of securing some representation for this country. Surprise was expressed at the refusal of Nasir-ul-Mulk to appear on behalf of Persia, one speaker suggesting that the refusal showed that he was an Anglophile, and general dissatisfaction was displayed at the choice made by the Govern ment of the Mushavir-ul-Mamalik, who, it was said, had not the ability to perform the duties required of him. The coming elections were then again discussed, and it was agreed that the Karguzar, the Rais-ut-Tuj]ar, and Saiyid Muhammad, the Excise, officer, were the hest choices for Meshed city. Some abuse of the Malik-ush Shu’ra was then indulged m : it was said that he had deserted the society and was now drawing 300 tumans a month from the British. The editor of the “ Bahar ” newspaper, however, protested and said that the accusation was false. In the second meeting there was much talk of the desirability of securing Persian independence at all costs, and notwithstanding our assurances general doubt was expressed as to our real intentions. One speaker sug gested that we would have opportunity at the Conference to demonstrate the value of the undertakings to observe Persian independence that we had so frequently expressed, and to obtain for Persia some satisfaction for the many wrongs she had suffered both during and before the war. It was decided that, whatever might happen, Persians should be prepared to defend the independ-- ence of their country if necessary with their lives ; and a circular exhorting toithat effect was drawn up for issue to the general public. This meeting closed with a resolution to unity among democrats. 10. News from There have been no further develop ments in the question of M. de Beauvaos’ disposal, and it is difficult to see what the end will be (paragraph 11 last week). But the suggestion now is to close the Russian 'Vice Consulate, and I can imagine no better solution of the difficulties Trouble has arisen between the Russian Vice Consulate and the local authorities in connection with the teldgraph control. I am informed by the Officer Commanding our troops at Turbat that M. Maximov has taken charge of the Meshed-Sistan line by ^oree, and that he will not allow the Persian telegraphists to work during the hours allotted to them, Maximov being under Tehran and not Meshed, I have referred the matter to His Majesty’s Minister. 11. News from Saiyid Padshah Khan, the Governor of Gulran, has arrived at Herat. He is to act as Governor of Ghor during the indispo sition of the Governor ; whose son, Haji Muhammad Amin Khan, is posted to Gulran temporarily. 12. The Governor of Ghurian has sent in 12 camels loaded with rice, which was intended to be smuggled to :&gt; Persia by the owner. Re represents tf7) \ that the camel men fled on the approach of his men. The Naib-ul-Hnkumah has ordered the rice to be confiscated : the usual portion being given as a reward to the sowars who made the capture. 13. The wife of one of the “ converted ” Russians was delivered of a son on the 14th instant, and the Naib-ul-Hukumah sent over a Mulla to name him. The name given was that of Sher Ahmad. 14. Abbas Ali, servant of the German party, petitioned the Naib-ul' Hukumah that he had entrusted a pony to a muleteer to sell at Meshed, and that the man placed the animal in the Ghurian pastures for grazing whence it was again brought to Herat. He asked the Naib to have the pony made over to him. The Naib, however, wrote on the petition with his own hand that it was now proved to his satisfaction that the German party fattened animals on Government rations and then sent thereto Meshed for sale at a profit, and declined to return the pony to Abbas Ali. 15. The remaining two converted Russians left for Kabul on the loth instant. The family mentioned in paragraph 13 above will follow later. 16 von Gruden has despatched to Meshed two messengers who are believed to have taken letters for Tehran. These two^ men have been captured here and are now in our custody : their communications have doubtless been forwarded to Tehran and we hope to secure the replies on their arrival at Meshed von Gruden does not intend to leave Herat until these reach him 17. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has forbidden all wine sellers to sell their liquor to von Gruden and his companion on account of the reports that have reached him regarding the intemperance of the former. 18. Kazim Reg—and presumably the Maulvi Barkat-ullah is reported to have left Bala Mughab for Maimanah. 19. Nows JroYU Turhostan and Tra'ns m Caspia.—A. telegram has been received by the Governor-General from the Sirdar Intisar at Sarakhs inform ing him that the Turkoman Aziz Khan had sent a deputy to Russian Sarakhs to announce that his master was,about to become the Shah of Turkes tan and to establish a government on the principles of Islam.

Current events .—There seems to be little change in Trans-Caspian Conditions. The Turkoman are reported to be much puffed up, and the Trans- Caspian authorities have an additional complication on their hands inconse quence. The atrocities committed by them at Tejan have, from reports received, reflected on the good name of the British, and have given Bolshevik propagan dists among the Austrian prisoners a handle, as both from Samarkand and Tashkent reports have been received that the Austrians have been assuied that the British massacre their prisoners, and that nothing short of desperate ^ esl st' ance will avail On the other hand the peaceful occupation of Merv and the restoration of orderly conditions there has had an excellent effect. Generally speaking in this imbroglio it appears to be a question of save us from our friends. Shortage of Bolshevik liquid fuel continues, and this is confirmed by a wireless message from Tashkent to Moscow asking for a 800 b. p. Disel motor to enable the Ferghana oil works “ Santo ” to be exploited. Tashkent reports at the end of October active propaganda among the Austrian and German prisoners, and states that Germans, who had hitherto held aloof, are joining up and that field commands, which had been jealously re tained in Bolshevik hands, are now being given to German and Austrian officers. The probably enormously exaggerated figure of 30,000 under arms at Tashkent is given, but it is added that of this total not more than 2,000 are properly clothed or equipped. Many Sarts, Persians, and other Asiatics of more than doubtful value are included in the Bolshevik troops. There is little doubt that hatred of the Bolsheviks is rife throughout Turkistan : at the same time until a definite blow can be dealt them they^will maintain their hold by terrorism on the native population and command subservient if unwilling sympathisers. As the Bolsheviks have the news sources in their hands they are able—at any rate for the time—to deny the^surrender of Turkey and Austria. No infor mation or the reception of the German collapse has yet come from Turkistan. Were the war prisoners once thoroughly convinced of the actual state of affairs and of the possibilities of their repatriation there is little doubt that the Bolshe viks teeth would be drawn. Operations against the rebellious khans,in Khoqand and Andijan are report ed. The results do not appear to have been decisive,ibut Khoqand, having once been plundered by the robbers, was a second time subjected to the same fate at the hands of its Bolshevik saviours. According to Bolshevik wireless messages there is no change on the Orenburg front. They have only recently admitted their retirement from Merv, and last night were making capital out of the accident to the Trans-Caspian armoured train. Meshed : The 23rd November 1918. } E. A E.

They proceeded to Bala Murghab with the intention of reaching Maimanah, but their further movements are at present unknown, A portion of their effects was apparently left with the Naib-ul-Hukumah for safe custody. Yon Gruden and Dimitrevich also entrusted certain closed and sealed boxes, said to be the property of Captain Wagner, to the Naib-ul-Hukumah in anticipation of departure. Up to the 22nd instant they had not reft. 388. Afghan attitude.—TL q British Agent at Herat furnishes a report on ) the reception of the news of the collapse of Turkey and the Central Powers at Herat of which the following is the gist. Afghan Sunnis acknowledging the Sultan as their Khalifah, were at first bitterly disappointed at the news of the Turkish surrender and refused to believe it. Conviction now appears to have been forced upon them and they are accepting the situation. The collapse of Austria and Germany, except inasmuch as they were allies of Turkey, caused little feeling.^ The soldiery and people generally rejoice that the fear of Afgha nistan being involved in the world war is removed, and the mercantile classes look forward to the re-establishment of normal trade conditions. With regard to the officials, the Naib-ul-Hukumah—a somewhat inscrutable man—has given no signs of feeling on the matter, but the Naib Salar, who was much under | the influence of Kazim Beg and the pro-Turk party was unable to conceal his | bitter disappointment. Events in Trans-Caspia have excited little remark at Herat, but reports of the considerate behaviour of British officers and troops to the native population have been favourably commented on particularly by the mercantile class. Russian Turkistan. A wireless message from Tashkent to Benin has been intercepted which states that the Soviet forces have been continuing the struggle against counter revolution for a year, that their military resources and ammunition is exhaust ed^ without hope of replacement, and that they beg that attention may be paid without delay to their difficult circumstances.The Trans-Caspian Government has issued a wireless proclamation to the forces arrayed against them calling on them to cut short the internecine strife on the occasion of the termination of the world war, and stating that they are ready to consider a Constituent Assembly for Turkistan on a general elective basis. An amnesty would be granted to all but the most serious offenders, and this offer, which is prompted by no weakness, will not be renewed. The inter nal condition of Trans-Caspia continues to excite great anxiety, the crux of the situation being the financial difficulties of the government. Meshed ; E. A. E. REEL, Lieut-Colonel iSECEET. W INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING THE 7 TH DECEMBER 1918 , NUMBER 47 . Khorasan and North-East Persia. 390. British force, —One squadron 28th Light Cavalry and 1 Company 19th Punjabis have proceeded to Askhabad. Trans-Caspian front. —The military situation is unchanged. Early in the week the Bolsheviks attacked the Trans-Caspian armoured train and advanced troops but were repulsel. Beyond some shelling from their armoured train they have since made no move. 391. Provinces. —Information received from Gumash Tapa by the Intel ligence officer at Bujnurd and considered reliable leaves little doubt that during the Turkish occupation of Baku a large number of rifles were imported by Turkoman traders in the Gumash Tapa region in exchange for grain and other produce conveyed to the vicinity of Baku in sailing vessels. The rifles are said to be partly of Russian and partly of Turkish pattern and to number several thousand. The Turkoman in that region are reported as strongly Turcophile and Turkish agents are even now said to be among them. At the same time no special signs of unrest appeared to exist, nor did there appear to be any offensive programme. A more recent incident appears to throw doubt on the latter assumption as a telegram was received at Krasnovodsk from the Russian Consul at Ashur Ada on the 4th instant that Turkomans at Khoja Nafas had seized a sailing vessel bound for Krasnovodsk from Bandar Gaz and were looting the cargo. A gun-boat proceeded to the scene, and a warning shot was answered by rifle fire by Yamut Turkoman who had quickly assembled. After firing some 40 shells the gun-boat took possession of the sailing vessel, but the cargo had already disappeared. Some apprehension of a Turkoman raid on the C. A. Railway is entertained at Krasnovodsk. The Persian side of the Sarakhs border is quiet but on the Russian side the high-handed proceedings of representatives of Aziz Khan of Tejen are causing alarm to the local Turkoman. Frequent robberies continue in the vicinity of Astrabad. These are generally attributed to Turkoman action, but there is reason to suppose that local intrigues are at work. V Herat and Afghanistan. 392. Miliary affairs —A subadar has been despatched to Ghor by the Naib Salar to select sapper recruits from the district on the “ Hasht-yak ” or one man in eight principle. The Kaib Salar is occupied in inspecting troops and artillery horses. The sepoys complain that the strenuous life prevents them from obtain ing substitutes when they go on leave on the same easy terms as formerly. 393. Germans and adherents. —There is no further news of Kazim Beg and Barakatullah. Dimitrovich has handed over Wagner’s baggage to the Naib-ul-Hukumah for safe custody. He was expected to leave for Persia very shortly and favoured the adoption of female disguise. The servants of the German party are also anxious to depart. It is not certain whether von Gruden himself will leave at the same time. 394. Refugees. —On the 23rd and 24th ultimo 37 Russians, of whom 19 were men and the remainder women and children, left for Kabul via Kandahar. Two or three engineers and one sick man remained behind. All reasonable arrangements for the comfort of the party appear to have been made. The Russian converts to Islam had not left. They received the statutory pecuniary gratuity on their conversion in spite of having indulged in a bout of intoxication. ‘ K-': fowi:V395. Influenza.-—AYYYXdXs at Herat from Kabul, Kandahar and Earah report heavy mortality from the disease. Distress is reported at Maimanah both from disease and food shortage. 396 Current events .—The Bolsheviks have unconditionally rejected the offer of the Trans-Caspian government for a composition of their differences and in a lengthy address set forth the purity of their motives for which their blood is freely shed, their detestation of the bourgeoisie and their determination to secure the untrammelled freedom of the people. On the other hand hardly a day passes without one or other unfortunate Persian or other victim of Bolshevik robbery appealing to us for redress. i he Askhabad government has been passing through a difficult crisis and although matters are temporarily better, it is difficult to see a successful issue to their difficulties under present circumstances. The arrival of a detachment of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment at Askhabad from Krasnovodsk and the impending arrival of reinforcements from Meshed may be expected to prevent overt disorder at Askhabad. According to the reports of returned agents the majority of Bolshevik troops are of very inferior native material. The Charjui bridge is reported as prepared for destruction if necessary and the east bank at Parah as defended by two 6-guns. The action at Dushakh appears to have severely shaken Bolshevik moral especially as regards Indian troops. Russian Turkistan. Meshed : R. A. P. REDL, LieutCol. s G. S. 0. 1. The 7th December 1918,with Germany is an accomplished fact. They profess to think that the armistice is merely a trick of the Germans to gain time and deceive their enemies. No report of democrat meetings has been received. The Russian Commercial Mission (paragraph 13 last week) have made no purchases yet. They appear to be watching events, and not to be interested in politics. 13. 'News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Nothing further has been heard of the party of suspected persons mentioned in paragraph 15 last week. As suspected, this appears to have been one of those reports so frequently made by paid agents who are in danger of losing their employment either through reduction of establishment consequent upon changes in the political situation or their own failure to supply news. 11. News from Turbat-i'Shaikh Jam. —The return to Jam of some of the Taimuri sowars for whose collection Habib-ullah Khan had come is reported (paragraph 14 of Diary No. 45). 15. News from Karaiz. — A. dispute is reported to have occurred between Jamadar Barat Ali Khan, Taimuri, and Jamadar Muhammad Rahim Khan, Hazarah, of the bistan Bevy Corps, w T hich was eventually settled by a compro mise. 16. The Customs authorities are said to have confiscated almonds the property of Sarwar Khan, a British subject. A further report is awaited. . News from Herat. —Muhammad Hussain Khan, Nurzai, who had emigrated to Persia two years ago, returned to Herat on the 13th instant. The usual security having been taken from him that he will not again leave the country he has been allowed to settle with his family and flocks in Shaflan. 18. About 100 Barbaris applied to the Naib-ul-Hukumah for permission to proceed to Meshed on pilgrimage, and asked for passes. !9. Kazim Beg visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 9 th instant and discussed with him the facilities for his approaching journey via Kila Nau and Bala Murghab. in the course of conversation he remarked that the Germans should now ally themselves with the Russians. ; Meshed ; The 23rd November 1918. 5 SGPI Delhi-644 E&amp;PD—21.12*18—8^. W. G. GREY, Lieut,-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan.CON ^IP^NTIAL . Meshed Diary No. 48 for the week ending the 30th November 1918. From His Brit ionic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. Meshed, the 80th November 1918. 1* Persian officials. The Kamal-us-Sultan, whose title is now the Hishmat-us-Saltanah, an honour having recently been paid to him for his pro- British attitude while Karguzar of Kirman, has left for Turbat-i-Haidari (paragraph 1 last week). The Govern or-General has promised to look out for some better post for him in course of time and meanwhile he will be of assis tance to us as Karguzar of Turbat, 2 . Salar Hishmat, the present Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari, whose loyal attitude towards both ourselves and the Kawwam-us-Saltanah is so satisfactory, is returning to his post after a few days spent in Meshed. He visited me on the 28th, and repeated his promises to help us as far as possible. Sirdar Intisar, after an interview with me in the course of which he assured me that he was merely going for inspection purposes, left for Sarakhs on the 28th instant. 3. Persian a flairs {local).—On the night of the 26th instant, in the course of a drunken brawl, Taki, the head servant of the Karguzar, killed Yunis, the carriage driver. The murderer has been arrested and imprisoned. 4. Persian affairs {general ).—presence of five robbers on the Karaiz road near Farirnan has been reported. The Kawwam says that the report is false, but this is doubtful and he has promised to enquire and take the neces sary steps in case it has some foundation. M ith this exception nothing contrary to law and order has come to our knowledge during the week. 5. Complaints are rife against the Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah, Governor of Daraiaiz, and we are thinking of re-appointing to this district the late Governor, Biza Khan, who was formerly unsatisfactory but is now believed to have changed his attitude. A suitable post will be found for the Ma’tamid, who has served us well during an important period. It is reported that every week two or three families of emigrants return to the Darajaiz district from Merv and its vicinity, and that many of the Turks who had taken refuge in Persian territory through fear of the Bolsheviks are now bringing their families and property from over the border with the object of permanently settling in Persia. 6 . British Brigadier-General G. A. H. Beatty, D.S.O., arrived at Meshed on the 29th instant, and iss staying at the Consulate-General. Lieutenant B). B. Maconachie, I.A.B.O., I.C.S., reported his arrival for employment with the Khorassan Levy Corps on the same day. 7. The acting Karguzar of Bujnurd has telegraphed to the Karguzar of Meshed informing him of the arrival of another British officer (Major Collum, see paragraph 8 of Diary No. 45), and remarking that we do not seem to have abandoned our intention to convert the local sowars into British troops (para graph 9 of Diary No. 46). As already stated there is no foundation' for this suggestion as it stands. 8 . The Customs statistics for the second three months of the present Persian year which have just been received show that trade with Bussia has ceased entirely ; the returns giving “ nil ” against both imports and exports by post as well as by caravan. A small amount of smuggling is, however, believed to have taken place, and we have, as reported, ourselves arranged for the export of a consignment of grain to relieve suffering at Askabad. In consequence of this condition of affairs Khorassan is more than ever dependent upon India for the necessaries of life; and it is unfortunate that, for the moment, military necessities prevent full advantage being taken of the situation.9. A banquet was held at the Consulate General on the night_ of the 26th instant to celebrate the victorious termination of the great war which was attended by all official members of the allied Powers and as many others as the premises would accommodate. The health ot* Our Allies was received with acclamation, and the proceedings were marked by enthusiasm and cordiality. It is not considered well to hold rejoicings in which the Persians are to take part during the month of Safar, as this has many unfortunate days and ia generally regarded as a time of mourning. 10 . Russian affairs. —The members of the Eussian “ Commercial Mission ” have also disposed of an immense quantity of rouble notes during the past week : with what object beyond a desire to accumulate local coin with which to make subsequent purchases is not apparent. The risk involved for the Persians in buying up these notes is an obvious one, and it has been and is being pointed out to tLem. 11 . Three Eussians, believed to be Bolsheviks, have been arrested by the Governor of Sarakhs and sent in to Meshed. They have been handed over to our military authorities by the Governor-General. 12. Persian and German intrigues. —Three secret meetings of the local democrat society were held during the week. Letters from the society at Tehran were read and discussed as usual, and their replies drafted. The ques tion of grain supply for the winter was introduced, and, as usual, some refer ence to our extensive purchases was made, and also to our having laid in a supply of poshtins for winter use by our troops. One speaker remarked that nothing had yet come of the Kawwam-us-Saltanah’s scheme for bringing in grain from outlying districts, and complained of this not having been followed up. It was decided to urge him to some action. A reference was then made to certain writers and lecturers in Meshed who had been deceiving the people by praising the justice of the British, and it was suggested that they should be assassinated, and the crime attributed to some members of the anti- democratic societies. A proposal that these offenders should first be warned was approved by the meeting. In consequence of wdtat was described as the uncertainty of the position at Baku and its neighbourhood it was decided to send some democrat agents to enquire into and report upon the real state of affairs: arrangements being made to supply them with Eussian money for the expenses of the journey. 13. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Shaji-us-Saltanah has sent in to Jam from Sarakhs 6 bullocks, 5 donkeys, and 3 horses, w ith some of his sowars. This is believed to be part of the property recovered by the Persians from the Turkomans wffio recently raided certain villages near Eussian Sarakhs. Habib-ullah has joined his brother at Sarakhs. 14. About 300 tumans w ere robbed from a caravan between Turbat and Abbasabad. This crime is supposed to have been committed by the robbers mentioned in paragraph 4 above. 15. News from Karaiz —The Officer Commanding the detachment of the Sistan Levy Corps at Karaiz held a display of horsemanship on the 19th instant which was attended by Shuja-ul-Mulk and his sons. The former seems to have been so much pleased and impressed that he sent 125 tumans on the following day to be distributed as prizes among the various sowars and others who took part in the display. 16 News from Rerat.—On the night of the 15th instant a serious robbery took place in the Hindu caravansarai. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered the thieves to be traced without fail. 17. It is reported from Kabul that influenza still rages, and that there are no less than 150 to 200 deaths daily from this disease. 18. Oae of the Eussian refugees at Bagh-i-Shiwan having obtained leave from the Naib-ul-Hukumah to return to Eussia persuaded another to join him; and the two were provided with government horses and an escort. They are to proceed via Chihil Dukhturan, but had not yet quitted Herat when the last report was despatched.—-r-rrr-—- £ 19. Von Gruden and Dimitrovitch have arranged with the Naib-ul- Hukumah to take charge of Wagner’s boxes that were left behind when the latter quitted Herat: but a hitch has arisen as the Naib declines to take delivery until the boxes have been opened and their contents disclosed to him. The Austrians explained that Captain Wagner had himself sealed the boxes, and that they had no authority to open them ; but the Naib did not accept this excuse, and the boxes were still at Chahar Bagh under a guard when the report left. 20 . On the 21 st instant the Naib-ul-Hukumah received a communication in some foreign language from Chihil Dukhturan which was eventually read and explained by one of the Bussian engineers. It contained an announce ment of the collapse of Austria and the outbreak of revolution in both Austria and Germany. The Naib asked the Bussians if this new r s could be true, but they replied that they had no information and could not say. 21 . Kazim Beg, accompanied by the Maulvi Barkat-ullah, left Herat at 11 a.m on the 19th instant for Maimanah via Pul-i-Pari, Kila Nau, and Bala Murghab. They were provided with 22 government ponies for their luggage, and were accompanied by a suitable escort. They travelled as far as Pul-i-Pari in a carriage, but were obliged to dismiss it there, there being no carriage road beyond. 22 . News from Turkestan and Trans-Caspia.—The General Officer Com manding the Military Mission has decided not to place an officer in Bussian Sarakhs (paragraph 21 of Diary No. 16), and, in consequence, the Persian detachment will not now return,.-.A ALmCAVAi ^ ^ Meshed Diary No. 49 for the week ending the 7th December 1918. 1. Persian officials. —Salar Hishmat and the Hishmat-us-Saltanah (para graphs 1 and 2 last week) have returned to Turbat-i-Haidari where the chief officials are all now friends of our own. * 2. The Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah, Governor of Darajaiz, has arrived in Meshed on one month’s leave of absence. It is suggested that he should be transferred to a new district which is to be formed to the south of Bujnurd, but no decision has yet been arrived at. In the meantime orders have not yet been issued for Kiza Khan the former Governor to return to Darajaiz. (Paragraph 5 last week.) 3. Salar Kusrat, a former second-in-command of troops in Khorassan, has returned to Meshed from Tehran whither he had gone on leave of absence. He is a firm friend of this Consulate, and we are glad that he has come back. 4. Mirza Ismail Khan Khurdu the Rais-i-Maliyah of Darajaiz has left Meshed to take up his post on appointment. 5. Persian affairs {local). —The head servant of the Karguzar was executed at 5 p,m., on the 5th instant. (Paragraph 3 last week.) 6 . On the night of the 5th the house of Najd-us-Saltanah, a former chief of the Eevenue office, caught fire through the carelessness of a servant, • and damage to the value of 10,000 was done before the fire was subdued. The conduct of the police was excellent: they arrived promptly, and worked hard. 7. Persian affairs {general). —A serious robbery has occurred on the Herat road : a large caravan having been extensively plundered. The nephew of one Samandar, an Afghan at one time m the service of Shaji-us-Saltanah, is suspected of having organised it. Investigation is proceediag, and a force has been despatched to trace the thieves. 8 . British affairs. —On the 2nd instant, one British officer and 80 men of the 28th Light Cavalry and one Indian officer and 89 men of the 19th Punjabis left Meshed for Askabad. This leaves only 80 men in garrison here, but the atmosphere is now so favourable to us that the temporary depletion of the local garrison is not of great importance. Moreover, more troops will arrive in a day or two. 9. One Agha Saiyid Husain, a Mulla of Kabul who recently arrived from Nejef, is attending meetings and indulging in praise of our administration in Mesopotamia. It is reported that certain of the extreme democrats have attempted, as usual in such cases, to represent that he has been bribed by us to take up this attitude : but the Muila is well known here, and their efforts have not met with success. 10. Lieutenant A. A. Gordon, whose services had been placed temporarily at my disposal by the War Office in response to a request from His Majesty’s Minister, left for Askabad on the 5th for work with the Military Mission who have lent me another officer during his absence. 11 . Deceptions, etc., in celebration of the termination of the war which were to have been heffi during the past week have been postponed for domestic reasons : it is hoped that they will take place within a few days. They include a feast for the Meshed poor: so many of whom remember the help they obtained from us during the serious famine of last year. 12. Bussian affairs .—No action has been taken to check the sale of rouble notes mentioned last week. I discussed the question with the Governor- General who was inclined to think that the benefit to those Persian subjects who already held rouble notes (which would ensue from the rise in the value of roubles) would exceed the loss which might accrue to others from the purchase of the notes now in course of sale locally. But it seems that the Commercial Mission do not retain here the Persian coinage, but convey it to the frontier where it is exchanged for fresh supplies of rouble notes. The Kawwam-us- VV - -JC'’ ^ Saltanah and I decided that the first step to take is to appoint a committee consisting of the Director of Customs, the Kevenue Commissioner, and som selected merchants, for the careful consideration of the question; but, whether in consequence of the warnings they have received or from some other cause, the townspeople appear to have ceased to buy. ]3. Persian and German intrigues. —A letter has been received by the democrats of Meshed from a party representing itself to be the corresponding societv in Afghanistan. The writers say that democracy in Afghanistan is on the increase, and that they intend shortly to demand representative government from His Majesty the Amir. No reports of democrat meetings held during the past week have yet been received. 14t Neivs from Tnrbaf-i-Shaikh Jam. —The Hazarah Saiyid Murtaza, through his officer Saiyid Asaf, has tried to effect a reconciliation with the Taimuri Mir Baki Sultan ; but the negotiations fell through owing to Mir Baki failing tc attend the appointed p;ace of rendezvous. 15. Neics from Ahraiz—Shuja-ul-Mulk sent out sowars to pursue the perpetrators of the robbery mentioned in paragraph 7 above, but the latter appear to have escaped over the Afghan border. The sowars returned having traced them to the neighbourhood of Kafor Kila. 16. Lieutenant Mathews proceeded to Hashtadan in consequence of information received that some messengers of the German party had left Herat: but although, in addition, sowars were despatched in all directions no trace of the messengers was discovered. 17. News from Herat. —Influenza is still rife in various provinces and districts of Afghanistan. The total number of deaths in Kabul alone is said to have reached 8,000 ; while in Kandahar the number was scarcely less. The disease seems to be of an extremely bad type: the majority of cases proving fatal. 18. A Peshawri who was sent in to the Naib-ul-Hukumah from the frontier with a report that he was trying to return to his native place from Bokhara has been kindly treated. He asked the Kaib to give him permission to proceed on his journey and to supply him with a passport for the journey. Both requests were granted, and the Naib asked the man to dine with him ; in order, our Agent reports, to ascertain the present state of affairs at Bokhara. 19. At 12 a.m., on the 24th ultimo the party of Bussian refugees, num bering in all 35 persons of whom 9 were women and 9 children, left Bagh-i- Shiwan for Kabul,, being supplied with a suitable escort and the necessary servants. Two of the party who had been engaged in some work which was not finished when their companions started postponed their departure until the 25th. ' • 20. On the 24th Himetrovitch proceeded to Chahar Bagh and delivered Wagner’s boxes (paragraph 39 last week) to the attendant of the Naib-ul- Hukumah, taking a receipt from him ; and asked the Naib for leave to travel via Persia. The Naib declined to allow this, and it was then arranged that the Austrians should send letters to Tehran asking for instructions. Letters were accordingly written, and despatched by the usual messengers, Eaiz-ullah and Ghulam Rasul. The departure of these men was duly reported by our Agent at Herat to the Agent at Karaiz (see paragraph 16 above). 21 . It appears that Kazim Beg on departure from Herat presented the Naib Salar with his valuable Arab horse. This Naib had shown favour to the Turk on more than one occasion, and his attitude to the German party generally had been decidedly more friendly than that of the Naib-ul-Hukumah who has throughout preserved a commendable regard for strict neutrality. 22 . Yon Gruden has sold his rifle for 120 tomans. It seems to be most likely that he and Dimetrovitch will remain at Herat until their messengers return from Tehran; although the last named said on the 29th ultimo that he intended to proceed via Persia dressed as a woman with some man who could pass him off as his wife. v 23. News from Turkestan and Trans-Caspia. —His Highness the Governor- General told me some days ago that a party of Turkomans had attacked a partyr of five men and one woman, all Persian subjects, between Merv and Tajen, and bad killed the men and carried off the woman with all the property and money in the possession of the party. This information has been confirmed from Sarakhs by a telegram from Colonel Battine. With this exception there is no N further news from the Sarakhs direction, beyond that a few more refugees have been arrested and will be sent in to Meshed. During the week fighting is reported to have taken place at Bairam Ali where a determined attack was made upon the British garrison. The encounter lasted for the greater part of a day; and finally the Bolsheviks were driven off. No report of British casualties has been received so far as I am aware. W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, LLis Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. Meshed ; The 7th December 1918. ' ' , \ 3 1 Q J 1 % /COCONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 50 for the week ending the 14th December 1918. 1 . Persian Officials. —Nusrat-ul-Mumalik, the Rais-i- ’Adaliyah of Kuchan, has been dismissed for various falsifications in the Courts and has been brought to Meshed where he will be tried in due course. . The Governor-General and I have decided upon the following changes m provincial Governors :— ( 1 ) Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah, the present Governor of Darajaiz, to be trans ferred as Governor of Sarakhs. ( 2 ) Shaji-us-Saltanah, the Governor of Sarakhs, to be transferred to Turbat- i-Shaikh Jam as Governor. (3) Shaukat-ud-Daulah to be Governor of furhat-i-Haidari, vice Salar Hishmat who is transferred to Kuchan. These changes have many advantages. The present Deputy Governor of Kuchan is not satisfactory : Shaji-us-Saltanah (who has been given the title of Salar Ashja for recent good work) has scarcely the years and ex perience required for the Sarakhs post in the present circumstances, and is now restored to his old post at Jam : the Ma’tamid-ul-^V izarah may be relied upon to follow our instructions implicitly : and the Shaukat-ud-Daulah is pro vided for, having been sufficiently punished for his misconduct last year by having been kept out of favour and employment for more than twelve months. 3. On the 12 th instant His Highness the Governor-General showed me a telegram he had received from a brother at Tehran informing him that the Shah s mind had been poisoned against him recently by an enemy, and that his recall was possible within a short time. I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister begging that this calamity may be averted. His Highness does not wish to go, but spoke of the amount of worry he had to endure here and the relief it would be to be unemployed for a time. Enquiries are being made into the situation : it appears likely that the Kawwam’s devotion to us has caused this trouble. 4. Riza Khan is appointed Governor of Darajais : vide paragraph 2 last week and paragraph 2 above. b. Persian affairs {local). It seems that orders were received from Tehran for the despatch thither ^of the Karguzar’s servant (paragraph 5 last week), hut the man had already been executed when they arrived, 6 . The question of rates and prices in the city needs attention. It is said that various articles of food are sold at different prices which causes hardship and gives cause for complaint. Some control over shopkeepers is necessary, and it is partly on this account that the appointment of a Town Governor was recently suggested. The proposal did not receive the sanction of lehran : on the ground that a precedent would thereby be established. J* Persian affairs {general).—-A. secret telegram has been received bv the Karguzar from the Foreign Office instructing him to see that no refer ences are made at present to Tehran on the subject of frontier questions, as the time is not propitious for raising such matters with the British Legation. (Ibis probably refers to the Sarakhs frontier question, and the despatch of troops to Russian Sarakhs which was vetoed by us on the ground of possible complications. This locality originally belonged to ^ersia.) 8 . A party of 18 robbers who were being sent in to Meshed from Sab- zawar under escort managed to effect their escape ; it is said on account of the escort not being sufficiently strong. Orders have been issued to all Governors for their re-arrest. ' 9. British affairs. The value of imports into Khorassan during the month of Mizan (24th September to 23rd October) amounted to the large sum of 23 iakhs of rupees : the largest item being, as usual, sugar. The imports forthe following month are probably equal in value, but all the returns have not yet come to band. Kerosine oil (from deposit in Askabad) appears to be the only article imported from Russia during Mizan. 1 10. The excellent conduct of our troops was again the subject of reference in meetings during the week ; as was also the growth of commercial activity between Kborassan and India. Great satisfaction was expressed with what 1 was described as the kindness of the British in importing sugar and tea ; ’ without which, it w r as said, it is not possible for a Persian to exist. 11 . Russian affairs* —It appears that M Maximov, the Russian Vice- Consul in Turbat-i-Haidari, is to proceed to Russia, and that there is a pos sibility of his being succeeded by M. deBeauvais whose intrigues against the Russian Consul-General here gave so much trouble early in the year, M. deBeauvais’attitude towards ourselves seems to have given no cause for complaint since the interview I had with him reported in paragraph 14 of Diary No. 16 this year; and I do not feel disposed to raise any objection to this appointment. But it is being vigorously opposed by the Russian Consulate General here, who regard it as a stepping-stone to the ejection of M. Nicolsky. They have also other reasons for wishing to diminish the personnel of their Khorassan officials : lack of funds being perhaps the chief. 12. Persian and German intrigues. —In recent democrat meetings it had ” again been stated that our communiques were false, and that the Turks were still in full possession of Baku and the whole of the Caucasus. But a tele gram was received during the week from a democrat chemist wTio had pro ceeded to Askabad which declared that the road to Baku was open and that the British were undoubtedly in possession. This news caused some surprise, but at the same time it was remarked that trade with Persia will now be possible and that rice can come from Resht as formerly. The democrat news agent who had been sent to Turkestan and Trans- Caspia has returned. He reports that all the Salur Turkomans of the district of Russian Sarakhs desire to become Persian subjects and are ready to emigrate to Persia if they can be granted land upon which to settle. A letter from a democrat at present at Bujnurd reports activity on the part of British officers there who, according to him, are enlisting both footmen and sowars and buying large numbers of mules. It was decided that this matter should be reported to the Governor-General, and that he should be asked to deal with it. 1 A detailed list has been drawn up by the democrats of Meshed of all the operations of the British in Khorassan. It includes the details of regular troops brought into the province: enlistment of Hazaras and Bujnurdis : and the purchase and storage of grain. This list has been sent to Tehran with the suggestion that the democrat committee there may show it to the Council of Ministers. This document was accompanied by. another representing the total losses suffered by Persians in this province at the hands of Russian troops during their occupation as 7,500,000 tumans. 13. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Shahzadah Jalal-us-Sultan, who has not yet been relieved in the post of Governor, has returned to Jam some what hastily owing to the robbery reported last week (paragraph 7). A force has been collected to assist him in dealing with this matter, but we hear that the thieves have crossed the Afghan border, where there is a rumour that they have been captured. 14. A native of the village of Bizd has been found murdered at Daman- i-Kuh. Enquiry is proceeding. 15. News from Karaiz. —It is reported that three Taimuri levy sowars took 33 krans from travellers going to Samghun. The offenders were reported to their Commanding Officer and suitably punished. 16. The arrival at Karaiz of Saiyid Asaf (paragraph 14 last week) is reported. It is said that his master, Sai^ id Murtaza, has sent him to inspect and report on our levies. 17. News from Herat* —The despatch to India of 200 camel loads of skins and 250 camel loads of wool is reported.3 18&gt; The Russian engineers and those recently converted to Islam have not left Herat. The former are still employed on different works and are giving instructions to the local Sappers and Miners. The Matter have been rebuked by the Naib-ul-Hukumah for visiting the Austrians too frequently. 19. Von Gruden was heard to remark on the 3rd instant that the British bad suffered a decisive reverse near Charjui at the hands of the Bolsheviks, losing a large number of firearms. 20. There is no further talk of the two Austrians leaving Herat, and their present position there is somewhat difficult to determine now that the war has ended. There is also no further news of Kazim Beg and the Maulvi Barkat-ullah. W. G.

Provinces —Seven armed Armenians have come in to Persian Sarahhs. They are said to be Bolsheviks and others of their kidney are expected. They have been disarmed by the local authorities who have been requested to despatch them to Meshed under escort. Some friction with the Persian authorities was recently caused by the presence of a body of Russians with arms at Muhammadabad who announced their in ten ti n of forming adefachm'ent there for service against the Bolsheviks* On application to the Iranscaspian authorities their return to Russian territory was secured. J l he robber Azizullah Khan from Turshiz with a portion of his band has been brought into Meshed. Astrabad remains disturbed owing to Turkoman unrest. It is possible that some improvement may be caused by the arrival of the new governor. Rumours of disturbed conditions in the B mdar Gaz region continue to be received, but nothing of a concrete nature has yet come to hand. - • Herat and Afghanistan. 340. Germans and adherents .—Nothing of interest is reported. Von Grudenhas been indulging in propaganda of a wild nature, apparently partially with a view to reconciling his followers to their pay being indefinitely withheld. 341. Refugees .—One of the Russians has died. He appears to be the senior engineer whose arrival was first repor'ed. Two others have applied for and received permission to return to their country. The auti orities state that Herat is unsuitable for the Russians to remain as being in too great proximity to their frontier, and suggest their transference to Kandahar. 342. Military .—Influenza still obtains among the garrison, and the artillery are unable to exercise their horses in consequence. 30 artillerymen under a jamadar have been sent to Ghurian in relief. Discontent against their Colonel has been reported in the Ghaznichi battalion. The Naib Salar left on the 3rd instant on tour towards Karkh, taking with him a Brigadier, and several senior officers. He is expected to be absent for about 10 days, General Eateh Muhammad Khan acting for him in the meantime. 343. Intelligence.—In the course of September an Afghan passed through Meshed towards Tehran. He is stated to be a Eogari named Dost Muhammad Khan, and a relative of the Sipah Salar at Kabul, Ghulam Haidar Khan, and a secret agent of the Amir. He is reputed to be proceeding through Tehran to Baghdad to collect intelligence regarding Western Persia and Mesopotamia. He is well supplied with funds. His personal description is given as of medium height and stout, age 40 to 45, complexion wheaten, grizzled beard ■which he wears trimmed. He was wearing Afghan clothes wRh ablue turlmn, ^ and khaki coat and pantaloons. ] u Th ■ ‘y ; . • ' ' : f ViOiA FCu&amp;Gtl toicr. Iso. £Q *5 13 DEC 1910 8 JAM 1018PRUSSIAN TlTRKISTAW. 844. Current Reinforcements are expected for the battalion of tl»e Royal Warwickshire Regiment which reached Krasnovodsk at the end ot September. A reliable informant gives the following account of affairs at Tashkent and in Turkistan. The question of supplies is most serious and enormous prices prevail. Bread is scarce and bad, rationed at g lb. daily and amounts to about 250 times pre-war prices. Clothing is practically unobtain able and boots cost 1,000 rubles a pair. The general hatred of the Bolsheviks is intense, and any success against them would provoke a general rising. German influence at Tashkent is very strong and their propaganda skilful and active. In the absence of any real news they are able to publish the most extravagant lies for general consump tion. The original Bolshevik plan of opening the route to Krasnovodsk has now to some extent been abandoned in favour of the Orenburg line whence they hope to obtain the help of regular German troops. Informant places the strength of their troops at about 8 , 000 , their grea r est dependence being placed on ex prisoners of war. The numbers are, however, fluctuating. The Bolsheviks are very short of money and utilise for local purposes their own notes which they issue wholesale. The shortage of oil-fuel has reduced railway traffic to a minimum, and tramways and electric lighting can no longer be maintained at Tashkent. The Bolsheviks claim a recent success against Dutov’s forces near Orsk. Except from Bolshevik sources there is so far no confirmation of this, a* d judging from their extravagant claims of success in Transcaspia, no particular- reason to believe it. Meshed; T E. A. E.

British force .—Reinforcements consisting of 2 British officers (Lieu tenants Smith and Ingle, 19th Punjabis), 1 Indian officer and 40 rank and file of that regiment, 1 Indian officer and ll other ranks 28th Cavalry, and ? levies, left for Askhahad on the 16th instant. Captain Parmer, attached to Mission, and Lieutenant Cavalier, 19th Punjabis, left for Kahka direct on the 17th instant. Two troops 8 th Light Cavalry have reached Meshed from Turbat. Kahka front .—On the night of the 13th-14th instant a mixed British and Russian force consisting of 3 battalions, several squadrons and guns, and including the 19th Punjabis, 2 squadrons 28th Light Cavalry, and Section of R. P. A. guns, left Kahka, and making wide detour round Armansagad, attacked Lushakh at 6 a.m. on the 14th instant from the north-east. Preliminary operations appear to have been completely successful. By 8-30 a.m. Lushakh was taken, the enemy having previously exploded their very large dump of artillery and rifle ammunition. Seven trains at the station itself were captured. Two of these contained stores and a third about 200 horses. An 8 th train escaped eastwards towards Takir, was captured and burnt by Turkoman, and the 300 Bolsheviks on board it killed. Two armoured trains were completely des troyed by artillery fire and the Bolsheviks between Armansagad and Dushakh cut off. Very heavy execution was wrought by our cavalry on the Bolsheviks escaping from Lushakh. Over 150 prisoners, 3 guns, 22 machine-guns and a number of rifles were taken. Lisregarding any possibility of counter attack the undisciplined Russian detachments with a very few exceptions proceeded to broach the contents of the captured trains, loading them on the captured horses and making off xegardless of the protests of their officers. At about 11-30 a.m. a heavy enemy counter-attack developed from the east, assisted by the Bolshe vik forces cut off on the west. Owing to the disorder noted above our detach ment with the help of a few Russians was thus called upon to face the fire of some 12 guns and many machine-guns for several hours. It was finally necessary to withdraw on Armansagad, and as the effective Kussian force then and later had almost completely dispersed, to continue the retirement to Kahka. This operation was carried out under cover of the fire of the 28th Light Cavalry. Our casualties were : 28th Light Cavalry, 1 Indian officer and 3 O. R. killed, 12 O. R. wounded, 4 missing ; 19th Punjabis, 1 British and 1 Indian officer killed, 43 I. O. R. killed, 3 British and 1 Indian officer and 134 I.O.R. wounded; Levies, 2 O. R. killed. In addition there were horses and a few mules killed. (British officers : Lieutenant Stephen killed ; Captain Shute, Captain Pigott, and Lieutenant Gipps, all seriously wounded.) The total Russian casualties amounted to 37 which in view of the fact that their force was probably at least twice as numerous as ours, requires no further comment. The Bolshevik casualties were very heavy indeed, but an accurate estimate is for the moment impossible. But for the disorganisation of the Transcaspian force it is quite within the bounds of possibility that this action would have secured the flight of the Bolsheviks from Transcaspia. As it is a heavy blow has been inflicted on them, heightened by the fact that on their calling on the majority of their forces at Tejen for the counter-attack, the Turkoman seized the opportunity to attack that place, killing the remaining garrison and damaging the station. As a consequence of the action the Bolsheviks have abandoned Lushakh and Takir, and retired to or beyond Tejen. Lushakh is occupied by our mounted forces and patrols are at and beyond Tak ir. f r 4 -■ Ci ' aX* ^ 7**I S i w - i ■ r 346. Provinces.—The Bolsheviks have for some time been threatening a descent on Russian Sarakhs, and during the week reports were received that a force was about to start. Later information tends to shew that this was in all probability a threat with the object of extracting supplies, and recent opera tions render its execution unlikely. Measures have been taken in conjunction with the Governor-General to despatch some local force to Persian Sarakhs. Exports from Astrabad, dated the 10th instant, indicate continued Turco man unrest. It is reported that the Governor intends the secret strangling of one of the most unruly chiefs. Turkish agents are stated to be very active among the Turcoman, but to have met with little more success than promises of assistance in time of need. 347. Local .—The 7 Armenians arrested at Sarakhs arrived at Meshed yesterday. Prom a preliminary investigation they do not appear to be Bolshe viks. Pour are by their own statement soldiers who accompanied peace delegates back to Kushk and were cut off by the fall of Merv, 2 are members of theMerv Dashnakuptsion sent to ascertain conditions at Askabad and in the Caucasus, and the last is an old merchant. Further enquiries are being made. Three more Turkish prisoners have escaped from the Ark. It is understood that the local authorities are taking stringent measures to fix the responsibility. Intrigue among the secret Caucasian committee continues to be reported, and is being watched. A curious feature is a rapproachement which is taking place be tween certain local Armenians and the heads of the Caucasian community. The pro-British attitude of the Armenians has been very considerably modified since the fall of Baku. Herat and Afghanistan. 348. Germans and adherents .—The strained relations between Kazim Beg and von Gruden appears still further complicated by competition for favour of the Russian ladies at Herat. Beyond stating that Turkish forces have occupied Askhabad they appear to have been comparatively inactive. Their followers are becoming very discontented, and are anxious to obtain news of the Kain region, probably with a view to making for their homes. At a recent meeting the Naib-ul-Bukumah remarked on the retreat of the German forces and the progress of the Allies on the western front, and appa rently no one found anything very convincing to say to discredit this news. Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan has reported that on questioning an arrival from Afghan Turkistan he has learnt that Mohendro Partap is there (presum ably Mazar is meant) and it well treated by the Naib-ul-Hakumah. There is so far. no confirmation. 349. Military affairs .—Regular drills have again commenced in the Herat garrison. ^ The^ Naib Salar was still absent on the 10th instant and no great military activity is being displayed. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered the Colonel of the Khaki battalion to take active steps to recover the revenue pending the return of his colleague. This action was taken on receipt of &amp; far man from Kabul. 350. Turkistan .—Letters received at Herat relate that a serious mutiny has occurred in that province of the troops against their commander, and that the latter has been sent under escort to Kabul. It has been heard through Risaldar Yar Muhammad that many Russians have been taking refuge in Afghan Tur kistan and subsisting on rations given by the Afghan authorities, but that they have now returned to their country. The influenza epidemic has been very severe in that province, but is now abating. 351. Refugees .—The deceased Russian engineer, now said to have been a Colonel, has been buried at Herat. His widow and family intend to return to Transcaspia through Meshed. Some of the Russians at Herat signified to: the Naib-ul-Hukumah their intention of embracing Islam, but were directed by him ^o reflect well before taking so irrevocable a step.% V Btjssian Turkistan. 352. Current Bolshevik atrocities and their efforts to enrol the local native population to fight on their side have to some extent, despite the difficulties and dangers of the road, facilitated communication. This, however, owing to the paucity of trains and desert marches entailed, is none too^ rapid. Beports have been received during the week from Merv, Samarkand, and Tash kent, covering dates to early in the present month. They confirm generally the communication reported last week. According to them the Bolsheviks are making a desperate effort to strengthen their military position and employing anti-British propaganda, cajoleries, and force to induce the native population to enlist. The last method has had some measure of success although it is very probable that the recruits are more than half-hearted and await only favourable circumstances to escape or to round on their tyrants. The Bolsheviks also apparently contemplate tbe wholesale employment of the prisoners of war at Samarkand, Tashkent, and other centres, and according to several informants this action is at present only delayed by a difference of opinion between the German chiefs and the Bolshevik commissioners. The former insist that the prisoner-troops and the direction of operations be entirely in their hands ; the Bolsheviks demur, and at present the matter seems to be at a deadlock. The prisoners themselves are said to display no keenness to enter the arena and are mainly concerned with the idea of getting home. An agreement on this point would, however, still further complicate the situation. The demeanour of Armenians at Tashkent is reported, since the fall of Baku, to have become acutely anti-British, and many of them to have offered their services to the Bolsheviks and to be drilling. It is also stated that a considerable number of Cossacks have recently joined the Bolsheviks from Orenburg. Whether this has any connection with the reverse which it is now fairly certain that Butov suffered it is as yet impossible to say. On all hands the shortage of oil fuel is likely to paralyse Bolshevik move ments. All private stocks are being requisitioned by force, and such economy as is possible is being practiced. This is, however, unlikely to carry them on for long in the absence of some fresh supply. Ammunition, especially for artil lery, is another serious shortage, and in this connection the loss of their Bushak h dump will have hit them heavily. A Bolshevik expedition is reported to have been sent against Khiva by the Amu Barya. Yomud in Khiva are also said to have taken the field and the death of the Khan is reported. Confirmation of these items is required. Some activity of anti-Bolshevik robber bands in Ferghana is reported and it may be hoped that this will develop. Meshed; E. A, F.

Khaha front. —As a consequence of the recent action at Dushakb, the Bols v eviks retired to and beyond Tejan which place has been occupied by our troops. The Bolsheviks w T ere finally located at Kara Bata to the west^ of Merv. Considerable damage to the railway is reported. With the exception of a few shells from the enemy armoured train there has been no further fighting. 854. Provinces. —Little of interest is to hand this w 7 eek. A report from Sabzwar states that public opinion is changing in favour of the British. 355. Bolshevik Mission.—One Babuchkin, formerly Bolshevik Commissary for foreign affairs at Tashkent, accompanied by another commissary named Shalashnikov and several armed Russians and Armenians, arrived at Meshed yesterday via Kushk and Pul-i-Khatun Babuchkin who brought his wife with him states that he has been appointed Russian Consul at Meshed by the Tashkent Authorities. The whole party who arrived armed to the teeth, have been detained in British Military custody. 356 Refugees— Six of the male Russian refugees from Herat, together with the widow and 2 daughters of Yon Schultz, the Russian Engineer who recently died at Herat, and the Russo-German “ Atrab ’ who was for some time at Herat with V on Gruden reached Meshed yesterday. Except in the case of the last named no particular suspicion appears to attach to this party. 357 Prisoners. — Two young Russians and 7 Hungarian prisoners of war, who deserted from the Bolsheviks from Hushakh at the beginning of the recent action arrived here 3 days ago. The Russians are in our ^ charge and the Hungarians in custody of the Governor-General. Erom their interroga tory all appear to have been employed as workers and not as fighting men. They had all been recently drafted to the front from Tashkent and other Turkistan towns. Erom their statements the Bolshevik forces at Hushakh would appear to have between 2,500 and 3,000 fighting men. It is understood that the Persian Authorities have succeded in recaptur ing 4 of the Turkish prisoners who recently escaped from the Ark. 358. Sarakhs. —Owing to disorder in Russian Sarakhs and. an appeal from some of the inhabitants for assistance, the Governor of Persian Sarakhs pro ceeded to the former place. Order was apparently quickly restored. Mainly owin^ to the Bolshevik threat of aggression on Persian Sarakhs and to the possibility of violation of the Persian frontier a Persian force of 200 to 300 men has proceeded to Sarakhs. 359. Mission. —Lieutenant-Colonel Battine, 21st Cavalry, and Captain Abdul Samad Shah both attached to the Meshed Military Mission left for Sarakhs to-day. Herat and Afghanistan. 360. Germans and adherents. —No fresh activity is reported. Kasim Beo* has of course done his best to characterize to the Naib/ul-Hukumah the communiques of Allied successes received by the latter ^sa tissu^ of lies. ,-. . ^ .2 361. Refugees .—Three of the Russian refugess at Herat embraced Islam &gt;nth great pomp and circumstance. 362. Military .—The Naib Salar was still absent on the 18th instant. The unsuitable ammunition returned from Earah has been received at Herat. The escort was practically all sick on arrival and some subsequently died. A squadron of Cavalry has been despatched to the Balamurghab frontier in relief. 3 lakhs of rupees of revenue have been recently recovered b y military collectors. An emissary despatched to the western frontier reports that practically all the personnel of Zulfiqar, Khatai and neighbouring frontier posts were sick. Hay was stored at the following places : Faizabad, Dahna-i-Doab, Kala Sufid, and Kira Bagh. At the last-named place all available accommodation had been used for grain and revenue in cash was in course of collection. Russian Turkistan. 363. Current events —^Conditions are much the same as those reported last week. It appears probable that the two Ferghana oil-fields “ Santo ” and “ Chimion ” the normal yearly yield of which is 3 million and 1 million puds of oil respectively, are still working, and the Bolsheviks would in that case have an emergency supply to their hands. ^ The approach of winter is likely to bring great hardships, both from want of food and warm clothing. Practically nothing is obtainable for apparel throughout Turkistan. Meshed E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel^ G.

Transcaspian front. —The enemy have evacuated Merv and retired towards the Oxus, Merv was occupied by our troops on the 1st instant. 365. Provinces. —Considerable local disturbances are reported from Astra- bad where the Governor appears to be powerless, and to possess no armed force capable of coping with malcontents. Two Turkish agents are reported in Astrabad. A letter belonging to one of them secured by one of our agents gives proof of his activities but there is no indication of its source. A report from the officers who proceeded to Sarakhs last week is awaited as to the actual position of affairs there. The Persian Consul at Askhabad Mirza Javad Khan, who bears none too good a character, spent some days at Daragiz in mid-October apparently in connection with the export of wheat to Russian territory. He is reported to have had three Russians with him who were anxious to reach Tashkent but whose passage was prohibited by the Governor and who returned to Russian territory. The only name which could be identified was that of Rosenthal that of a Bolshevik commissary supposed to have been killed at the time of the Transcaspian arising but regarding whose fate there was some doubt. Javad Khan makes a good thing of it at Askhabad by selling Persian flags to timorous persons to utilise in time of stress for their personal protection. 366. Refugees. —The Russians noted last week were mostly officers who had been serving with Zykov’s detachment of Turkomans against Kushk. When Merv fell into Bolshevik hands the gallant Turkomans dispersed and the officers succeeded in escaping across the Afghan frontier. Two of the party were Menshevik refugees from the Bolsheviks from other places. The person called by the Afghans “ Atrab ” is a young Russian subject born of German parents named Edward Gatzke. He served in the Turkistan sappers at Warsaw, was wounded and relieved from military service. He fought at Tashkent during the Bolshevik rising against the Kerenski regime, and on the defeat of the latter was a fugitive in Turkistan for some months until he reached Herat some 9 months ago. He lived at Bagh-i-Kartah with Von Gruden who, however, suspected him and treated him harshly until he seized the present opportunity to depart. Had we be enable to get in touch with him earlier he might have been exceedingly useful. As it is his return to Herat seems out of the question. 367. The only person of this party whose detention is advisable is one Shylov who accompanied Madame Von Schultz. This man appears to be both a Bolshevik and in great part a German. With this exceptioh the male refugees left for Kahka yesterday. 368. Local —The four Turkish escaped prisoners have now been recaptured and brought to Meshed. .y... •••■&gt; - -« -'*• v r ■ i • \ £0 DEC i !r i n K ■il ■ IK / Herat and Afghanistan. 369 Germans and adherents.-?!o activities are reported. Kazjm Beg unsuccessfully tries to explain away the communiques which are said to be producing an^xcellent effect. The news now on its way to Herat will afford a fine scope for his inventive faculties. _ * it 370. Afghan attitude. -The recent European arrivals from Herat all a ^ree that the attitude of all Afghans whom they met on the ^ay to and at Herat was stronglv Turcophile. They are all extremely eulogistic of their treatment by the Afghans, Gatzke, in particular, evincing very warm gratitude. . . . » 371 Converts .— The three Russian converts to Islam, the principal or whom is one Captain Slivitzki, formerly chief of stall at Kushk, and apparent y of Bolshevik tendencies, are said to have definitely decided to renounce any idea of return to Russia. t 372. Military.— The Naib Salar was still absent on the 24th tiltimo. He was stated to be very busy in attending to documents sent for his attention. Cavalry have been sent in relief to the Bala Murghab and Anardarrah frontier. There was difficulty in finding a relief for Gulran and Ghurian detachments owing to the employment of men on the collection of revenue. Russian Turkistan. 373. Current events.—It is probable that Merv will be found to have been cleaned out by the Boisheviks as they have been reported to have been sending away as much grain and produce as possible. The Turkoman have succeeded in hiding most of their supplies, but it may be found exceedingly difficult to induce them to part with the residue alter their recent famine experiences. The Tashkent Bolshevik Government has been sending very despairing; messages to Moscow, asking for urgent assistance. This is in shaip contrast j with their boastful claims to victories. If the Orenburg route remains sealed, there is little doubt that their plight will be a sufficiently desperate one, but Bolshevik successes to the north of Orenburg point to the- possibility of this| route being opened, in which case many complications will he introduced. Relations between the Turkoman and the Transcaspian Government have recently been acutely strained. The latter who appear to have adopted an unwisely arrogant attitude have now eased matteis by apparently equally unuise concessions. The question is complicated by jealousies between various Turkoman leaders and will undoubtedly require careful and judicious treat ment in the future. The Transcaspian financial situation owing to reckless expenditure and to the fact that no income is available is acute. * Native reports state that unarchy prevails in the districts, and complain that they are no better treated by the Mensheviks than by the Boisheviks. Two of our messengers have recently been killed in Transcaspia, and the family of one of our adherents complains that their frontier village has been plundered by the Mensheviks of what the Bolsheviks had left them. In thi&amp; case it is probable that marauding bands are to blame. E. A E. REEL, Lieut.-Colonel, G.

Current events .—Affairs in Transcaspia remain much as outlined last week. Reports from native sources express joy at the presence of British troops at Merv and the consequent security to the population. A Jew here has received a telegram from a co-religionist at Merv stating that since the arrival of the British peace prevails and requesting the immediate despatch of such goods as may be possible. At the same time the Turkoman excesses in the districts at the time of our advance have produced dismay. It had been hoped that the bare presence of our troops in the country would suffice to restrain licence, as it obviously has anywhere in their vicinity. A report from an agent at Tashkent dated the 18th October notes the hasty collection of troops by the Bolsheviks. Very few of these appear to be Russians and the Sart and Persian elements predominate. The Cossack reported to have joined the Bolsheviks are men of Dutov’s force who deserted owing to dissensions. The agent states that he saw 200 of these men in Tashkent. His information confirm the reverse which Dutov suffered. On the other hand the Bolsheviks were said to have met with a defeat in Semirechia. In Tashkent the Bolsheviks were doing all they could to convert the Austrian prisoners to their own tenets, and the German Consul was very active in propaganda among these men. This tallies with information trom Bolshevik sources received by wireless, and is no doubt a part of their general present political campaign. Information regarding the Bolshevik expedition to Khiva is scanty; from roost reports it does not appear to have materialised. The notorious Khivan lurkoman Junaid Khan is said to have been active against the Bolsheviks whose expedition according to some accounts had stopped short at Darud Kul Ihe Amir of Bokhara apparently continues to sit on the fence. He is reported o e continuing the purchase of arms, and their local manufacture supervised y a skilled German or Austrian prisoner of war who is verv hi^hlv remunerated As far as can be judged the Amir is still afraid of an o^pen breach with the Bolsheviks, but would be ready to join in against them the moment they experienced a sufficiently severe set-back. The scanty garrison left at Kushk, numbering only about 100 men have ° R tl ? e J r M nS r pIa . n The wireless station is reported intact but the Bolsheviks have had time to bleed the fortress of praciically all the war material of any value which it contained.

Provinces. —With the exception of Astrabad which remains in a state of chaos all is reported normal and quiet. The news of Allied victories and the conclusion of the armistice with the Central Powers has been received with pleasure by all except outre Democrats and the Caucasian element, as proving an earnest of more established economic conditions in the future. Persian troops have been withdrawn from Russian Sarakhs, and as far as it is possible to judge there is no immediate prospect of Turkoman excesses in that region. The sanitary conditions at both Persian and Russian Sarakhs are described as deplorable. Herat and Afghanistan. 373. Germans and adherents. —Kazim Beg is reported to have been much cast down at the new s of the surrender of Turkey, and his affection of disbelief in the news carried little conviction. It is reported that he is about to set out for Mazar-i-Sharif with the object of entering Russian territory presumably en route for Turkey. In conversation with the Afghan authorities on the subject of recent events the Naib Salar w r as inclined to share Kazim’s scepticism but the Naib-ul-Hukumat left no doubt of his opinion in the authenticity of the news. Kazim Beg has burnt certain records and papers. Yon Gruden seems fully occupied in flirtations with the Russian females at the Bagh-i-Shirvan. 374. Refugees. —A Farman has been received from the Amir ordering the transfer to Kabul, probably via Kandahar, of all the Russians at Herat with the exception of the engineers engaged on the reconstruction of the Pul-i-Malan. Russians who attempted to enter Afghanistan from the direction of Kushk were recently turned back by the Afghan frontier authorities. Turkomans were informed that they must proceed to Kabul and become Afghan subjects if they entered the country, and on refusal of these conditions were also turned back. 375. Military. —The Naib Salar returned from his tour on the 5th instant and on the following day held a ceremonial parade of. the garrison. Measures are ordered by a farman from Kabul to round up and return to that city all soldiers overstaying their furlough granted to them at Herat. 376. General. —Beyond the natural disappointment of the Turcophile element no excitement of any kind is reported at Herat at the news of the Turkish surrender. Recent events in Trans-Caspia seem to have aroused little attention. It is known in Herat that the Bolsheviks had practically dismantled the fortress of Kushk of all war material of any value. With reference to the confiscation from Afghan subjects resident in Turkistan of their money by the Bolsheviks—confiscation being a euphemism no doubt for robbery at the point of the bayonet—an agent reports the receipt of a letter in Russian Turkistan from the Naib-ul-Hukumah couched in very stiff terms, the gist of which was that the Bolsheviks called themselves I * ^ Ia Government but tbeir actions with regard to foreign snl)jocts proved them no bitter than common brigands. This letter was translated into Kussian and forwarded to Tashkent where it is said that restitution this and similar indications it may be surmised that the Afghan authorities would not regard the fall of Bolshevism as interpreted m lurkistan with unmixed grief. Russian Turkistan. 377 Current events .—Financial straits are weakening the hands of the Trans-Caspian administration, and encouraging the Bolsheviks in their midst. The Turkoman crisis is again becoming acute and as before outlined is comp Heated by the question of food supply for the Russian and native population in Trans-Caspia. On the other hand the Bolsheviks appear none too happy, and yesterday a wireless message was intercepted which stated that the White Guards an international imperialists were stifling “ Red Turkistan ” but that the re presentatives of the latter were determined to carry the struggle to a victorious conclusion. General Malleson proceeded to Askhabad by motor on the 14th instant. f'- y hi I' k Meshed ; The 16th November 1918 ,) • E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel, O.

V Persian officials. —Shahzadah Jalal-us-Sultan has resigned the Gover- norsnip ot Shaikh Jam and has returned to Meshed. The question of his successor is under consideration. o j IT Ta j Muhammad Khan is dismissed from the Government of Shirvan, and Munshi Hamayun who came from Tehran with the Governor-General is appointed in his place. r&gt; if 1 M 'I 1 ' 8 '!!

The 200 men of the regular troops were supplied with British rifles on loan; by a special arrangement with the Governor-General. _ The object of the despatch of this force is to defend the Persian frontier against a possible attack by Bolsheviks 5. Persian affairs, {general).—The disposal of the robber Chief Aziz-ullah and his men (paragraph 2 of Diary No. 41) has not yet been decided. Yakub Khan one of the two remaining followers of Aziz-ullah who were yet at lar^e tvt 8 ify b ^ e -r ar . rested 1 m the neighbourhood of Shahrud and brought ^to Meshed; while the other has been shot by Persian sowars while attempting to escape arrest. The whole gang is now accounted for; and the Sirdar intisar to whose energy the dispersion of this gang as also that of the Zushkis an Shikaris some months ago is justly attributed, has come in for some eulogy on the part of the local mujtahids and preachers. British affairs. —The value of goods imported from India during the month of Samboleh (August 24th to September 23rd) amounts to nine and a j . i ak ! ls . of rupees. Military transport arrangements are at present necessari ly interfering with trade facilities to a certain extent on account of the laro’e numbers of camels hired by us : and much of the merchandise recently import ed has been for a long time on the way. 7. We have supplied His Highness the Governor-General with 200 rifles ^, ( ? r arm ament of the regular troops in garrison {vide paragraph 4 above). The understanding is that the force to be armed will co-operate with us m the defence of Persian frontier if necessary, and that the arms are to be retained by the troops only so long as His Highness remains in office and continues to work wholeheartedly with us. 8 . Brigadier-General W. E. R. Dickson, C.I.E., Director-General of the Quetta-Meshed Lines of Communication, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Synge, Supply and Transport Corps, arrived at Meshed on a visit of inspection on the 24th instant. 9. Russian The Karpardaz or Persian Representative at Askabad has come to the Darajaiz district to purchase and export 20,000ponds of grain for the Russian community in Askabad. We have also arranged to supply this quantity with the consent of theKawwam, and it is not understood whether this is a different consignment or the same. Enquiries will be made, but in any ^ case the Governor-General will object to more than one consignment leaving the Darajaiz district where present conditions are not good. 10 . Two months ago the Karguzar sent to the Russian Consulate General a note mlorming my colleague that if he did not shew more activity in regard to the settlement of cases in which the defendants wore Russian subjects the Jvarguzaii would be obliged to summon such defendants and proceed with the cases without further reference to him. Simultaneously a copy of this docu- K 'd - ■' 4 A* cc 9 K9V ■ '5 C.IHi A ment was sent to the Foreign Office at Tehran ; who have now replied com mending the Karguzar for his action, and directing him to proceed in the manner indicated should occasion arise. 11 On the 25th instant the Bolshevik Consul-elect, M. Babouchkine, accompanied by his wife and a M. Eolashnikov, the Military Agent at Tashkent, arrived at Meshed in state escorted by five Bolshevik Cossacks ; and the whole party were piomtly arrested by our troops and placed m confine ment ; the Babouchkines being subsequently located in the quarters m this Consulate recently vacated by the Austrian dentist and his nife. The disposal of this party will be reported later. 12. Six Russian officers with Madame von Sshultz, the widow of a Russian Colonel who recently died in Herat, (paragraph 2 3 last week) with her two young daughters, arrived in Meshed on the 25th instant and were arrested, being believed to be Bolsheviks, Enquiries showed, however, that the ueceased Colonel and one of the officers of the party were Bolsheviks, and that the remainder are merely refugees from Bolshevik misrule who had fled to Afghanistan hoping for temporary protection there. The lady and her children have been billeted with our friends at the Russian Bank and will be sent to Askabad shortly ; five officers have been set at liberty and will probably also proceed to Askabad ; and the remaining officer is still in custody pending settlement of his case. The member of this party who was reported to be a German appears to be a Russian, native of the Baltic Provinces, and it is doubtless on account of his knowledge of German that von Gruden invited him to reside with him (paragraph 24i last week). 13. Versian and German intrigues —The three Turkish prisoners who had escaped from detention in the Ark as reported last week w r ere recaptured at Sabzaw r ar, and are being sent in to Meshed. One of the two whose escape took place some weeks ago has also been retaken, also at Sabzawar, and the fifth is known to have taken the Tehran road and it is hoped will be caught at Shahrud. There recaptures are ajhighly satisfactory sign of the times; and show that not only the Governor-General but also the police are working well with \ ns. 14. Eight escaped Austrian prisoners (paragraph 19 last week) have arrived from Kalat and been interned in the Ark. 15. The return to Meshed from Russia of Agha Shaikh Jawad, Balur Earush, the brother of the celebrated Shaikh Kazim, is reported. This man is also said to be an advanced democrat, but I am assured that he will give no trouble now. No democrat activity is reported to have taken place during the week but the Malik-ush-Shu’ra, democrat leader in Tehran, has issued a manifesto accusing Haji Muhammad Ja’far Kashmiri (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 39) of having become a British spy: his interview with me having evidently become known to his colleagues. I am also accused of having bribed the Haji, which is untrue. The Bahar has published an indignant denial, which we are supporting. 16. News from Karaiz. —Our Agent reports the passage through Karaiz of the Russian party from Herat mentioned above. He appears to have rendered them assistance with the Customs authorities and others. Such arms as they carried were confiscated by the Customs officials, and I am arranging for their return to them with M. Delcorde. 17. News from Herat. —The Naib-ul-Hukumah has warned all frontier officials to be more careful in respect of smuggling which he hears is on the increase into Persia: the articles principally mentioned are rice and ghee. their decision were duly received on the 11 th instant (paragraph 23 last week). Considerable interest was displayed and approval shewn by the general public. * 19. On the 12 th instant some of the Russian refugees employed von Gruden’s servant Nasr-ullah to make some purchases for them in the bazar, . .and on hearing from Nas&gt;nllah that he had been induced to be responsible for the payment of certain sums yon Gruden became much annoyed, and an altercation ensued. 20. Kazim Beg received an unknown visitor on the 14th, who is reported to be either a Turk or an Arab. He is believed to be the same man who arrived in Herat via Russia about a year ago and brought a letter for Kazim on that occasion. 21 . On the 15th instant the Haibml-Hukumah visited Kazim Beg and showed him somepf the Meshed war communiques. Kazim said that the news tlierein contained was entirely false, and asked his guest how he regarded it. The Naib gave a guarded reply, saying that he preferred to await the reports of his Meshed correspondence before venturing an opinion. After the departure of the Naib Kazim collected his servants and informed them that ail the news spread by the British Agent was false, and that the German and Turkish armies would soon arrive on the Afghan frontier en route to invade India. v jo 22 . On the 15th the Naib-ul-Hukumah made the necessary arrangements for the departure of the Russian party mentioned above. They were ^allowed eight Government ponies to accompany them as far as Meshed. (These animals, which were in charge of a Naib of Transport and two syces, have been sent back to Herat from Meshed.) 23. On the 18th instant von Gruden, who appears to be interested in the conversion of these refugees to Islam, brought one*of the Russian engineers to the Naib-ul-Hukumah. This man also expressed a desire to change his religion, but apparently was dissuaded by the conditions imposed by the Naib which seemed to him too strict. 24. News from Turkestan and Trans-Caspia .—No further fighting is reported but our troops are said to have occupied Tajend, It seems that Shaji- us-Saltaneh, the Persian Governor of Sarakhs (paragraph 26 last week), has recovered a number of camels, sheep, and oxen, the property of inhabitants of Russian Sarakhs, from Turkoman raiders. He has occupied Russian Sarakhs temporarily at the request of the local Russian Commissary, and has asked for further reinforcements from Meshed. Another hundred infantry have accordingly been despatched (paragraph 4 above). W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel^ Sis Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khoraasan. Meshed ; The 26th October 1918. SGPI Delhi-^632 F&amp;PD—25-11-18—30.Meshed Diary No. 44 for the week ending the 2nd November 1918. 1 . Persian officials .—The following minor changes have been ordered in Khorassan Government posts :— ( 1 ) Agha Mnwassuk-us-Sultan is appointed to be Rais-i-Maliyah of Sabzawar ; the present incumbent being summoned to Tehran. ( 2 ) Mirza Ismail Khan Khurdu is appointed Rais-i-Maliyah of Darajaiz, and the present incumbent is recalled to Meshed. (3) Shahzadah Muhammad Ali Mirza is appointed Eais-i-Maliyah of Bujnurd, and the present Kais is recalled to Meshed. (f) The piesent Rais-i-Aukaf of Meshed is taking leave and Agha Iftikhar-ul-’Ulama is appointed in his place. 2. Persian affairs (lo^al). —It is now commonly reported in the citylthat Persia has come into the war. This is probably the result of the despatch of troops to Sarakhs reported last week. General approval is expressed of British kindness in helping Persia with arms and money; and it is hoped that Persia will secure the rectification of her frontiers as a reward for interveniion. 3 The body of Agha Mirza Muhsin, the Mujtabid who was murdered in Tehran some time ago, has been brought to Meshed and buried in the Shrine. It was received with great honour: many of the chief ofiicials and merchants of the city going out to meet the cortege. 4. Persian affairs (general). —Some disorder is reported from Shirwan and Kuchan : probably owing to the absence of a Governor at the latter place. The robber Chief Khuddu is again active ; patrolling the villages ostensibly in the interests of law and order : while the Excise Officer of Kuchan is said to be levying tax to such an extent that a number of traders have taken sanctuary in the telegraph office, demanding his dismissal. 5. British affairs. —We have had some little trouble with regard to the export of grain from the Darajaiz district mentioned in paragraph 10 of Diary No. 42. The Governor-General received reports (including one from Captain Abd-us-Samad Shah) that the amount of grain available in this district was insufficient to permit of so large a quantity being exported, and asked me to reduce the amount. After some discussion [it was arranged that the amount agreed upon should be exported, and half of it, viz-, 10,000 ponds, returned to the district by us later. 6 . A secret telegram has been received by the Karguzar of Meshed from the Foreign Office asking how it is that he had not reported the fact that the British were building barracks for their troops in Khorassan : a report to that effect having been received by the Foreign Office from the Karguzar of Birjand. He has replied that he had no information but would make enquiries and submit a report later. We have, as a matter of fact, commenced the erection of temporary barracks at Turbat-i-Haidari which are required there as there is no place outside the bazar in which the troops could be located. The Governor of Turbat has raised no objection ; neither has the Governor- General to whom the matter was referred by General Dickson. This is not a new subject for discussion, having been raised in a similar manner some months ago. 7. Brigadier-General Dickson, C.I.E., and Lieutenant-Colonel M. Synge, D.S O., left Meshed for Turbat-i-Haidari on the 30th ultimo. On the 29th the Karguzar, the Mutwali Bashi of the Shrine, the Sirdar Intisar, Commandant of the local forces, and one or two other friends, visited the General at the Consulate ; and the Governor-General subsequently returned his visit. 8 . The Karguzar has reported to the Foreign Office the arrival and imprisonment by us of the Bolshevik IJussian Consud' Babouchkine (reported last week). g .• r ./l, ^ I (■ r- ' 1 v^J X / ‘■‘ a £0 13 TEC 53 8 * fo 5 *3 I JAM V vA * v*.i 9 . It seems that eleven men of the levy detachment which, under the command of Lieutenant Casting, proceeded to Trans-Caspia some two months ago, deserted after the fight that resulted in the occupation of Dushakh by our troops. The detachment has been recalled to Askabad for garrison duties. 10. The news of the cessation of hostilities with Turkey was received on the 1st instant, A special messenger was at once sent to Herat to inform the Governor, and steps were taken to spread the information in the province without delay. We have been the recipients of much congratulation, and general satisfaction is expressed at the prospect of a general peace at an early da^e. 11 . Russian affairs. —Madame Schultz, the Russian refugee lady from Herat mentioned last week left for Askabad this day ( 2 nd instant), and the six officers on the 1st for Kahka whence they also will proceed to Askabad. 12. Revsian and German intrigues —The arrival at Meshed of one of the Jewish members of the Russian Commercial Mission is reported. He is staying in the house of Haji Rustum Karahaghi and will be watched. Some promi nent democrats of the lower class have been seen conversing with him. 13. Two meetings of the democrat society were held during the week as usual. Letters from Tehran were read in one of which the Khorassan brethern vrere again warned against the sinister growth of British influence in their province: special reference being made to our road construction which is being carried on with or without the permission of the present altogether unpatriotic government, A speaker then called attention to our construction of barracks at various places in Sistan, and called upon the Cabinet to take up these two questions with the Legation at once : urging that they must be quite ignorant of our real intentions in Persia. Another individual recommended the despatch of a deputation to the Governor-General, and referred to our large purchases of grain which were apparently permitted by him. Our new friend Haji Muhammad Ja’far here interposed with the remark that he knew exactly how much we w r ere buying, and added that we had no intention of storing with malicious intent and would not buy in excess of our requirements. 14. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Our Agent reports that a representative of the local democrats waited upon him offering the services of the local branch of the society for any work we might require of them, and suggesting the employment of himself as news-agent. This is obviously the result of our recent successes in Prance and the surrender of Bulgaria. 15. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —After some hesitation the Taimuri Chiefs have consented to supply Habib-ullah with sowars to proceed with him to Sarakhs in support of his brother the Governor and ourselves. It is reported that some of the men of Saiyid Muhammad Beg Jamshidi are also with the Taimuris in this neighbourhood. 16. News from Karaiz. —-Lieutenant Matthews, Sistan Levy Corps, has arrived with 40 infantry, and a similar number of sowars are expected in a day or two. Mr. Matthews has occupied the Russian quarters, and his troops will be accommodated in the serai hired for the purpose Shuja-ul-Mulk appears to have welcomed the newcomers satisfactorily and to be providing necessaries., 17. News from Herat. —The arrival of ten families of Baluch immigrants, and their subsequent despatch to Chakhansur, is reported. 18. A Kandahar trader has petitioned the Naib-ul-Hukumah regarding 10 lakhs of gold roubles and drafts on Indian Banks which have been robbed wliile en route to Kandahar from Herat. He obtained an order from the Naib direct ing the Governors of Parah and Girishk to trace the thieves, and has sent a message to the Banks in India by telegram from Meshed asking them to stop payment of the drafts. , „ 19. Himitrovitch.appears to be sceptical in regard to the conversion tn Islam of the three Russians (reported last week). He says that they have some secret reason for pretending to be - converted. (The opinion of the Russian officers mentioned in paragraph 11 ^bove is that the conversions are not genuine,) f20. On the 25th ultimo our Agent met the Naib-ul-Hukumah in company with a number of military officers, etc., at the Shrine of Maulvi Jam. The Naib asked him whether it was true that Bulgaria had surrendered to the Allies and received an affirmative reply. He remarked that the war would soon end, and gave the impression that he believed the approaching victory of the British to be on account of the intervention of America. He said nothing about Turkey. 21 . Our Agent writes that the daily communiques are having a good effect in Herat, and that the efforts of Kazim Beg to falsify them have none. The Naib-iil-Hukumah seems to be convinced of their truth. 22 . The Russian officer who was at first believed to be a German and who is numbered among the six officers mentioned in paragraph 11 above has given us some interesting though not very valuable information regarding von Gruden. He was apparently a professor a mathematics before the war, and is a volun teer 23. News jrom Turkestan and Trans-Caspia —-Oartrjops occupied Merv on November the 1 st, and the fall of Kushk is expected to take place within the next few days. I have received several messages from Colonel Bailey at Tashkent : some in clear and some in cipher. He begs me to get into communication with him, but a recent report announces that he has made his escape so that there seems to be nothing to be done in this direction pending the receipt of further news. Meshed ; The 2nd November 1918 ) W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent’ of the Government of India in Khorassan* Snin Lelhi—577 FAPD-.i-lM.3-30* CONFtDENTIAIi. Meshed Diary No. 45 for the week ending the 9th November 1918. 1 . Persian officials —Mtm much delay and the surmounting of various difficulties our friend M. Kornelis has been re-appointed to the post of Finance Commissioner He is generally popular in the city, and his restitution has given satisfaction to all parties including the moderate democrats. 2. Another friend of ours, Shahzadah Hashim Mirza, who was recently Rais-i-Aukaf, is appointed Public Prosecutor in the local courts. The Ma’tamid-ul-Ayaiah of Nishapur is posted as Governor of Sar Vilayat. 3 . Persian affairs (/oca/).—Orders have been received by the local Director of telegraphs that telegrams should now be accepted for Constantinople and Bulgarian, Greek, and Belgian towns ; but that he should warn the public that the administration cannot be responsible for any delay that may occur in the receipt of replies. 4. General rejoicing at the surrender of Turkey to the Allies is evident in I Meshed city. Those who are connected with the carpet industry are especially pleased : they suppose that this trade which has been practically suspended for so long will now re-open. A very considerable proportion of the Meshed public are in some way or other connected with this industry. 5. Persian affairs {general). —The Deputy Governor of Kuchan (para graph 3 of Diary No. 40) has arrived and assumed charge of the post It is hoped that the disturbances mentioned last week will now cease. 6 . British affairs —The continued receipt of good news regarding the war f has its effect here. It is now generally accepted, even by a large section of the democrats, that the best prospects of Persia lie in the direction of friendship with the British ; and we receive constant congratulations from all classes the large majority of which are probably sincere. ' 7.. The enlistment of Hazaras for the Khcrassan Levy Corps proceeds steadily but not so speedily as we had hoped. Sickness is the chief cause of the delay in collecting the men. The total at present is 104 : several men have been discharged as not being up to the standard we hope to maintain. 8 . Major Collum, 26th Light Cavalry, left Meshed on the 6 th instant for Bujnurd. His deputation is in connection with the proposal to raise temporary levies for trans-frontier work. 9. Russian affairs. —Nine Russians and one Italian arrived in Meshed during the - week, having been sent in from Sarakhs as refugees. They were at first taken to the Ark under the orders of the Governor-General in ^communication with us, but have since been released. Eight of this party, including two officers, have been despatched to Askabad. 10 . I have been requested during the week to take up several claims of Russian subjects against the Trans-Caspia Government. The applicants com plain that their property was first plundered by the Bolsheviks when in power at Askabad ; and that now the present government wish to levy taxes on the same property. The cases are hard, but there seems to be nothing to be done at present at ‘ least. 11 . Persian and German intrigues. —The member of the Commercial Mission mentioned in paragraph 12 last week has rented a portion of a caravan serai the property of Meshedi Abd-ullah, the Russian Tajir Bashi, for ten years at a rent of tumans 17,000 for the whole period. He has paid 5,000 in advance. My colleague maintains that this is a genuine concern which is connected (as before reported) with a respectable and longstanding commercial house at Moscow. It appears that this is probably the case : were the Mission working in enemy interest they would be scarcely likely to adopt the methods they have followed since their arrival in Khorassan ^and their conf^ntipa that they are compelled to be idle for the present on account of t^e. di§o?ders in, Russia is reasonable.' At the same time their prospecjs ^efia^so ^r^jyork'\in this L. ^ 9 O * I 13 DEC 1913 j 8 JAN • ^ f -j 51province is concerned, as there is no present prospect of the establishment of order in Russia. I have received a report to the effect that the sum of 72,000,000 roubles which was captured by the Askabad Government some three months ago while on its way to the Bolsheviks had been sent by the members of this Mission. This appears to be unlikely, and the report was given by one who has much to fear from successful competition by the Mission. It will be investigated as far as possible. 12 . The democrats society here is now in disorder. There are no less than th^ee pirdies now : one is headed by Haji Muhammad Ja’far Kashmiri and Saiyid Muhammad, the local Excise officer : the second by Danish, the son of Haji Abd-ul-Hussain Tehrani : and the third by the irreconciiables, Shaikh Kazim, BalurEarush, and Shaikh Ahmad, editor of the celebrated “ Bahar.” The first two parties are now friendly^to us, and the third, the numbers of which are now very much reducecT, 'Is quiet and practically of no importance. The Rais- ut-Tujjar, who is prepared to adopt at any time any role that may be suitable, now professes the utmost friendship for us, and has much assisted us recently by the sale of a large quantity of grain at prices specially reduced on account of what he calls a long standing friendship. Great discord exists among the three parties of democrats. 13. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —I have received a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister regarding the matter mentioned in paragraph ll of Diary No. 42 which states that the Persian Government complain of irregular conduct on the part of British officers in connection with the purchase of Government grain. I have discussed the matter with the Governor-General who says that no complaint emanated from him : that it must have been made without his knowledge by the Einance officer who has just been relieved by M. Kornelis. All that His Highness requires is the renunciation of 150 kharvars of grain from Salami village for sowing purposes. This very modest requirement has been communicated to the General Officer Commanding who will doubtless see his way to arrange for the concession. 14. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.»—The inhabitants of the village of Bizd have recovered from the Taimuris a number of sheep, alleging that they were plundered from them by the Taimuris who participated in 'the Hazarah- Taimuri conflicts last year. Habib-ullah Khan is still in the neighbourhood, and may be relied upon to settle this matter if the need for his intervention becomes necessary. Mir Baki Sultan and the Ilbaigi Kaudani are not at Jam but at their villages some distance out. ° 15. News from ILaraiz. —The local Customs officer, with more zeal than discretion, has confiscated ornaments which a muleteer was taking to Herat, the property of the Naib Salar of that place who had sent metal to Meshed for the construction of the articles in ques tion. The matter is being discussed with, and will no doubt be amicably settled by, the Director of Customs at Meshed. 16. News from Herat. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has changed round the Governors of Ghor, Ghurian, and Kuhsan. ,, i 7 - The Governor of Kushk having brought in some Jamshidis to Herat the Aaib-ul-Hukumah enquired of them the present whereabouts of Saivid Ahmad Beg Jamshidi. They replied that he with two others had been removed hy the Russians, they did not know to what place. They added that they had been for a long time desirous to return to Afghanistan, but had only just found the opportunity. The Kaib has allowed them to remain upon condition that they give an undertaking never to leave the country, and consent to give up their bad characters (presumably political offenders) to justice. m The Naib-ul-Hukumah has dismissed Bahardur Khan, the Governor of Anar Darrah, and has appointed Habib-ullah Khan, Achakzai, in his place. import of a quantity of kerosine oil and other commodities from Lanjdeh is reported, and it is said that trade with that part of the country has again become possible. . *ipanmaBBKsi ■ear^r-^S -P 20. By permission of His Majesty the Amir the Naib-nl-Hukumah des patched his family to Kabul on the 30th ultimo with a suitable escort, 21 . Von Gmden is reported to he making fresh preparations for a journey, but has made no announcement. He is much annoyed because the Russians at Bagh-i-Shiwan have requested the Naib-ul-Hukumah not to allow him to come so frequently to Bagh i-Shiwan. 22. Yon Gruden is still suspicious of his servants, and has given out to them that he has an apparatus in his room for the purpose of photographing intruders: that if a thief enters the room his photograph is taken at once without his knowledge. 23. Our Agent reports that one Haji Shiru Khan, the Agent of a Meshed trader of some importance (who is also the local representative of a British firm and therefore to some extent a British protege) is about to return to Meshed from Herat, and should be examined on arrival as he has been sought out by the servants of the German party on several occasions. This will be done. 24. The servants of the German party have been discussing among themselves the probability of receiving their long deferred wages: they remind one another that it is now three years since the practice of giving them paper acknowledgments in lieu of pay was first introduced by their employers. One of the men remarked that they could not believe von Gruden’s statement that the papers were of value, and cited as a reason that he had frequently announced the impending arrival of troops that had never appeared. 25. News from Turkestan and Trans- Caspia.—'K.VLsIdk (Russian) has been occupied by Askabad Government troops (paragraph 23 last week). There has been no further fighting. A detachment of Persian troops which had temporarily occupied Russian Sarakhs at the request of the local Russian Commissary is now being with drawn. It had crossed the border on account of Turkoman raids accompanied by the Governor of Persian Sarakhs, Shaji-us-Saltanah, and had been useful in defeating the raiders and recovering raided property. It is reported that the local inhabitants, including the Commissary above mentioned, are loth to see the Persians depart as they believe that the Turkomans will at once resume their depredations stimulated by a desire for revenge. No further news has been received regarding Colonel Bailey. Meshed ; The 9th November 1918. } W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, Sis Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. SGPI Delhi 1 — 575 FAPD-*3»14-28'-3&lt;X1. Persian officials. —Hashmat-ul-Mumalik has been appointed Naib-ul- Hukumah of Tun, and Imad-ul-Mumalik that of Bijistan. Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, Revenue Officer of Gunabad, has been transferred to Bijistan in a similar capacity. 2 . Persian affairs {local). —The yearly Police budget has been sanctioned for tumans 6,600 per mensem only, whereas Major Sjoberg had asked for 9,000. This is unfortunate, as the Police department is working admirably and should not be handicapped by insufficiency of funds. The Law depart ment of Khorassan has hitherto received no budget allowance, but this year a sum of tumans 1,400 monthly has been allowed for payment of the staff who appear to have existed hitherto on commission fees received in connection with the various cases heard in the courts. 3. M. Kornelis has signalled his return to the Revenue office of Khorassan (paragraph 1 last w T eek) by assisting us in the purchase of 1,000 kharvars of revenue grain at Kuchan in regard to which various excuses and delays had been made by his predecessor. The advantages of having a staunch friend in this particular post, particularly during the stay of British troops in the province, are enormous, and M Khornelis displays much tact and skill in his management of the deoiocrat party; many of the democrats of Meshed have in fact supported our endeavours for his reinstallation. 4 Persian affairs [general). —The district of Jandak is added to the limits of the Khorassan province and placed under the government of Tun and Tabas which it adjoins. 5. The province is quiet: no reports of raids or disturbances have been received during the week. 6 . British affairs. —The welcome news of the signing of an armistice with . Germany was received on the 12 th instant, and was the cause of general rejoicing. The Consulate offices were closed and flags hoisted, and we have since been the recipients of many congratulations from all classes. 7- Major General Malleson, C.B., C.I.E., Commanding the Military Mission, left for Askabad via Kuchan by motor on the 14th instant accom panied by Captains Nash and Jarvis, Staff Officers On the 15th Lieutenant-Colonel N. M. C. Stevens, wffio has been staying at the Consulate, proceeded to Kuchan. 8 . As might be expected, we experience some trouble from the muleteers and camelmen engaged for service with our troops. These men are inclined to take advantage of their connection with us to oppress the country people and to graze their animals in the fields as may be convenient, without permission. Recently one such muleteer, apparently for no sufficient reason, beat an inhabitant of Robat-i-Kulambah on the Sharifabad road so severely that he died from the effects. The offender is imprisoned in the Nazmiah, and enquiry is proceeding. 9. Our Karguzar has received a secret telegram from the Foreign Office enquiring into the work of Major Laukes at Bujnurd. The telegram states that a report has been received to the effect that Major Daukes is converting the local sowars into British troops (paragraph 8 of Diary No. 37) ; and the Karguzar has replied (with truth so far as I am aware) that the report is incorrect. He adds (which is also correct) that the matter has been discussed here between the Governor-General and myself, but that some reference to it should l)e made at Tehran to His Majesty’s Legation. 10 . Russian affairs. —The Karguzar has received yet another reminder on the subject of the report that he was directed to submit regarding the losses suffered by Persians during the occupation of Khorassan by Russian troops. He has replied laying the blame for the delay upon the Governor-General, and pointing out that the Commission which was to have assembled to enquire '' ■ •• -a \ 3 $ kb. inLib.': 1 Oini hi 1 J? t vi £ Is X v v. A N:j f - o ' it/ 8 £0 DEC '■i ( : B into the matter in question was to have been convened by His Highness. (It may be remarked that I continue to receive compliments upon the behaviour of our troops towards the people of this province, and favourable comparisons of their conduct with that of the Kussians). 11 . Persian and German intrigues. —The Governor-General has arrested and interned a wounded German prisoner refugee who was discovered by one of his men in a public bath. This man had managed to enter the town without detection, and had gained the sympathy of certain people by professing a desire for conversion to Islam. 12. The third, or irreconcilable, section of local democrats have raised their vo;ces in protest against the re-appointment of M. Kornelis to the Revenue office, and have even suggested that a riot should be organised in support or their views. This proposal has, however, received no attention. 13. The Russian Commercial Mission (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 45 ) have given us no further cause for suspicion. 14. Three democrat meetings on successive’nights took place during the past week. After a discussion in connection with the replies to be given to recent letters from the sister society at Tehran, the question of the provision of grain for Meshed city was taken up, and the management of the Revenue office came in for some well deserved abuse. It was decided to refer the matter to the Governor-General, and to press the new Revenue officer to make adequate provision for the coming year by importation from outstations. Our communiques were then referred to and it was again remarked that all the news therein contained could not be true, as so many routes by which in formation could reach Meshed are still closed. A prominent member of the society here put in some sensible advice, urging those present to calm and patience and pointing out that the vexed question of the independence of Persia would now soon be decided after which everything would come right. Mention was then made of our road construction in Khorasan and Sistam A speaker pointed out that the former condition of the roads had been good enough for the people of the country, and that as the British were merely carrying out improvements for the benefit of their troops, Persia -svould be in a position to claim compensation after the troops had been withdrawn. FinaHy it was, as usual, decided to report to Tehran the views of the assembly on the various points discussed. lo News from Turbot-i-Haidari. On the morning of the 7th instant our Agent was informed that a party of two Europeans, two Afghans, and three Turks were seen at midnight on the 5 th 17 miles from Turbat on the urshiz road. The Officer Commanding was communicated with, and steps were taken by him, but the report has not been confirmed. In any case these are not our Herat friends, as the latter were in Herat on the dates named. 16. News from Saroit!.—Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakharz is reported to be giving all assistance to the Officer Commanding our Levy post. ,, dl . Th « n t ews ° f the s “ ren 1 der of Turkey to the Allies reached Karaiz on tne otn instant and was received with general rejoicino-. 18. Mr. and Mrs Murray of the American Presbyterian Mission reached Raraiz on the 5th instant and left for Meshed via Taiyabat and Shahar-i-nau. 19. News from Herat.—The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered the imprison- ment of 5 persons sent in by the Governor of Anar Darra on a charge of habitual smuggling of sheep and ghee to Persia. '20. Von Gruden summoned his servants on the fith instant and told them not to beheve the reports at present current regarding German and Austrian defeats. He described a marvellous new gun that had been recently invented by the Germans, which had a shell sufficiently large to destroy a whole town on explosion, the cost of which was 700 tnpians. 1 n , 21 ; T o? Naib-ul-Hukumah summoned Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat- ullah to Chahar Bagh on the evening of the 6 th instant, and showed them what is described as &amp; firman (probably a Government notification). Kazim’sface fell on perusing it, and he asked the Naib for a private interview which was granted. It subsequently transpired that t\ns finnan ordered the expulsion of Maulvi Barkat-ullah and Kazim Beg from Herat, and the despatch of the majority of the Russian refugees to Kabul. Arrangements are in progress for Kazim Beg to proceed to Russia via Mazar-i-Sharif, and for the majority of the Russians to set out for Kabul. 22. On the 7th instant Kazim burnt a quantity of books and papers in the kitchen of his residence, and on being asked the reason replied that they were secret documents which he preferred should not fall into enemy hands. 2 d. The news of the Turkish surrender reached Herat on the 8 th. On the following day it was discussed at a meeting of the Naibml-Hukumah, Naib Salar (who has returned to Herat after a somewhat prolonged absence), and Kazim Beg. Kazim remarked that he did not believe the report, and the Naib Salar was inclined to agree with him, but the Naib*ul-Hukumah took a different view, remarking that the news was too important to be false. Kazim Beg remarked that he would remain in Herat until the 13th of Safar (November the 18th). 24 News from Turkestan and Transcaspia. —The Persian troops and Gendermerie have been withdrawn from Russian Sarakhs with the exception of twenty men who are to remain as escort to Colonel Battine who is to remain there for the present to see that no further disorders occur. The Governor- General fears for the safety of the Persian residents, but it is considered to be unlikely that any further Turkoman raids will take place. Meshed ; The 16th November 1918. W. G.

The Chakhansur authorities are displaying some perturbation at the departure of large numbers of labourers who are said to be seeking employment on the Nushki Extension Railway. They are endeavouring to induce the migrants to return by promising them work in Herat where they state that wa°es of Krans 3 per man daily can be earned on Government buildings. Such announcements are not likely to have much effect on the class concerned. 2. There is a story in Chakhansur to the effect that 30 men, in the course of some excavations at Jalalabad, have discovered a number of large pots con taining gold and silver coins which have been sent to His Majesty the Amir. 3 It is reported that the forts at Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah, Kala-i-Eath, Kala-i-Kang, Chakhansur and JaTi Robat are all to be repaired in turn this autumn.

Persian officials. —Shahzadah Adal-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Turbat-i- Haidari, who was recently recalled in favour of the Kawwam-us-Saltanah s Secretary, is now appointed Governor of Sabzawar (paragraph 1 last week). 2. Shahzadah Shuja-us-Sultan, the Governor of Kuchan, is recalled ; his con duct in certain recent local matters not having been satisfactory. His successor is to be a man brought in from outside Khorassan by the Kawwam, in whom he has confidence. (I know of no suitable person for this post in the province at present.) 3 . Kukn-ul-Wizarah, the present Rais-i-Tazkirah or Passport Officer, is appointed Karguzaf of Darajaiz and Kalat by the order of the Tehran Foreign Office. This man was formerly Karguzar in Sistan, and professes to be very pro-British: if this is so, he will be extremely useful on the frontier. 4 . His Majesty’s Minister informs me that Kamal-us-Sultan, formerly Karguzar of Kirman, has been appointed. of Turbat-i-Haidari. In regard to this man’s sentiments there is no doubt, and he can be relied upon to serve us faithfully. 5 . Ahmed Ali Khan, sometime Governor of Kalat, has gone to Sarakhs on a special mission in connection with the Turkoman refugees, of whom large numbers are now coming in ; and our friend Shaji-us-Sultanah, the Governor, seems to think that his relief is imminent, which is, however, not in prospect. 6 . His Excellency the Governor-General has dismissed the chief of his body guard, Ali Khan Sawad Kuhi, for misconduct while employed on the recent expedi tion against Aziz-ullah Khan (paragraph 7 last week), during which he is said to have extorted a large amount of money and some carpets from different people. The offender is to be deported to Tehran. % 7 . Persian affairs (local). —Influenza has practically disappeared from Meshed city, but it is still raging in certain parts of the province ; notably in Turbat-Shaikh Jam and Karaiz, where it has carried off several people of more or less prominence : among them being the Barbari Chief Saiyid Haidar’s very troublesome secretary. There have been reports of cholera in the city during the past week, but upon investigation they have proved to be cholerine only (paragraph 6 last week). 8 . Persian affairs (general). —The local authorities at Kuchan had commenced to take measures against the robber Khuddu and some of his subordinate bands : I have, however, asked the Governor-General to order the suspension of these opera tions, as we may have need of Khunddu’s men for levies before long. This His Excellency has done, while regretting that he cannot give us definite official help in connection with the raising of levies. 9 . Aziz-ullah Khan Turshizi (paragraph 7 last week) has been brought to Sabza war en route to Meshed : and a party of sowars have been sent to Abbasabad to arrest Yakub, one of Aziz-ullah’s followers, who is said to be there. 10 . British affairs.—On the 25th instant I attended a wedding breakfast given by Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakhaz, in celebration of the weddings of his two sons. During the entertainment one of the sons gave me two useful pieces of information. One was in connection with the two supposed agents of Muhammad Ali Shah, who were touring in Khorassan some months ago and were believed to be Turkish agents in disguise. It appears that they were adventurers who had no other object than to raise money for themselves, representing it to be for the cause of Muhammed Ali Shah. I had already heard something of this kind, and as Bakharz was one of the places visited the point may be regarded as cleared up. The next item of information was concerning the large parties of Russians who have recently arrived in Herat ■, my friend says that they have not come for any special purpose, but are merely fugitives from Bolshevik persecution. As the relations of Bakharz and Herat are close and friendly this may also be received as correct in the absence of any further information. u-ij. po O.P D3 16 fvOV i p rv* 11 . My interview with the democrat leader Haji Muhammad J’afar Kashmiri took place on the 28th instant in the house of Saiyid Muhammad, the Chief of Excise, who professes to be both jsro-British and a strong democrat, though not of the extreme type. The Haji made various promises of friendship for the future, which were reciprocated by me ; and finally I consented to ask the Governor-General to allow the reappearance of the “ Bahar ” on certain conditions. - 12. Russian affairs. —'Dr. Nasir Begov (paragraph 9 of Diary No. 37) was arrested on the 27th instant, and will be despatched to India with a party of mili tary prisoners, which is expected to leave to-moirow or next day. My colleague came over at once to protest on hearing of the news : and I explained to him the reasons for the action taken. He showed no resentment whatever, merely remark ing that he could not believe that Nasir Begov could have made the remark or assumed the attitude attiibuted to him. # 13. Our continued success in the fighting that is occasionally taking place in the neighbourhood of Kahka is producing the best of impressions in the town : raising our prestige as well as giving the necessary feeling of security. 14. Persian and German intrigues. —On the 25th instant, the Governor-General, having already arranged the matter with me, sent over a man who has for some time been detained in the Arak on suspicion of being a Turkish agent : suggesting that perhaps some mistake had been made regarding him as he was said to have no concern with the other Turkish prisoners. A very brief examination, however, convinced us that he was dangerous, and he was returned to confinement. 15. In the local democrat meetings during the past week nothing of impor tance (to us) was discussed. A proposal was made that all democrats below a certain age should be armed, and it was suggested that in view of the possibility of a Bolshevik invasion of Khorassan the Government prohibition against the carrying of arms would be removed. One of those present remarked that the British would prevent the possible invasion : and finally it was arranged to send agents to examine and report upon the real state of affairs on the frontier. 16. The daily war communiques now issued by the General Officer Command ing the Military Mission are much appreciated and of the greatest assistance in political work. At first we suffered from an absence of staff to cope with the extra work entailed in translating the communiques, but have been fortunate in finding two men sufficiently well equipped for the task. The democrat leader mentioned in paragraph 11 above congratulated us on this new form of propaganda. We are also arranging for the publication of extracts from current news in one or two local journals. 17. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—-The arrival of Mr. Gould (paragraph 9 last week), and his departure for Karaiz on the following day, is reported. 18. News from Karaiz. —Influenza is reported to be almost universal; but it is said to be of a mild type, no one having as yet died from it. Mr. Gould and Major Lang, Commandant, Sistan Levy Corps, both arrived on the 21 st instant. In spite of attacks of influenza they inspected the Russian quaiters lately vacated by the post of the sanitary cordon, and selected a caravan serai for the entertainment of the levy detachment which, on account of certain advantages which Karaiz possesses over Jam, is to be stationed at the former place for the present. On the 23rd instant the officers mentioned visited Shuja-ul-Mulk, returning to Karaiz later in the day. 19. News from Herat.—As a special case the Naib-ul-Hukumah has acceded to a request from Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakharz, for the export from Herat of a quantity of lice which is required for the marriage festivities mentioned above (paragraph 10 ). . , 20 . The Governor of Bala Murghab has sent in to the Naib-ul-Hukumah 100 sheep and three camel-loads of ghee with a report that they were confiscated by the frontier sowars when in the act of crossing over to Russian territory. 21 . The new reception hall at Chahar Bagh is completed, and having been prepared for use at the ensuing festival, was entered by the officials for the first time on the 17th instant. - . - ; • . . . . r1 22. Von Gruden appears to be cultivating friendly relations with the Russian refugees. On the 14th instant he is said to have advised them to be careful of their money while in Kabul, and not to spend it lavishly for the good of the local people, as he did, since no good can result from that. t&gt; T^’r^ n ^J 16 ^ ns ^ an ^ Kazim Beg found one of the water carriers at the Bagh-i-Kartah trymg to get into von Gruden’s room, and the latter on hearing of this gave fresh and strict orders regarding the security of his premises. 24. Kazim Beg and Nasrullah are now saying that the Russian refugees have escaped from di-treatment by the British and not by the Bolsheviks. It seems that e Afghan Governnent are not, after all, inclined to receive all these refugees at Kabul. Orders have now been received for the first arrivals only to proceed thither : a choice being given to the remainder either to remain at Herat or to goto possible 8 may 1 SUpP ° sing that a return t0 their own country is not 25. Kazim Beg visited the Naib Solar secretly on the 19th. It is not definitelv known what subject was discussed, but the Sharif of Mecca and India were mentioned and on the following day the Naib Solar was heard to instruct his trade agent on no account to buy bills on Indian banks m future as bankruptcy would before long be the fate of all banks m India. It is suggested that some coming events in India may have been discussed. ° \ Meshed, The 28th September 1918. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, H. B.

Persian officials. —Agha Mirza Abd-ullah Mudarris-zadah has been appointed Bais-i-Aukaf of Tun and Tabas, and has left Meshed to take up his post. Agha Mirza Muhammad Khan Kafi-ul-Mulk has been appointed Bais-i-Maliyah of Sar Wilayat. 2. Persian affairs {local). —Sirdar Intisar, the Commandant of the Persian troops in -Khorassari, returned to Meshed in triumph on the 10th instant, bringing in his train the robber chief Aziz-ullah and sixty of his men. Their disposal is under consideration. 3. The Governor-General, apparently acting under orders from Tehran, is demolishing the houses and caravanserais built upon the endowment lands adjoining the tomb of Nadir Shah ; and a large dome with galleries is to be erected round the tomb. Some injustice is involved in these proceedings, as certain of the premises to be demolished are let out for long periods and the tenants are being summarily ejected. They have been promised compensation, but the prospects of its payment are not considered to be good. British affairs .—Monday the yth instant was observed as a day of rejoicing to celebrate the allied victories gained on the various battle-fronts during the previous few days, and the surrender of Bulgaria, A reception was held in the morning which was attended by all heads of departments and principal merchants of the city and by civil and military officers of the allied nations. The Governor-General called in the afternoon to pay a special visit of congratulation, and the Consulate office was closed and flags were flown during the day. The first day of Muharram commencing at sunset on this day, it was considered better to hold the reception in the forenoon. 5. Secret. A telegram has been received by the JZ'irguzar from the Minister of Foreign Affairs directing him to send to Tehran daily telegraphic information regarding the actions of the British in Khorassan. He has 'replied that not very much has been done in the city of Meshed hitherto, but mentions the following items :— (1) Arrest of the doctor Nasir Begov, (2) Arrest and subsequent deportation to India of the Austrian dentist Kohrlich and his wife. (3) Our reception noted above. (4) The despatch of a party of labourers and engineers to repair the Meshed-Askabad road, and make it fit for automobile traffic, (5) The visit of Major Haukes to Bujnurd and the purchase of thirty mules there by him : also the fact that he has rented a house and apparently settled down. .6- W e have again been largely occupied in the purchase of grain for the .ceding of our troops: a large amount being required for export across the frontier. This years harvest having been good this matter does not present the difficulties with which we had to contend m the early part of the year and we are being assisted by various landowners who were powerless to help at that 7. Russian affairs. —The Karguzar is asked by telegraph from Bujnurd what steps should be taken in the case of 110 Russian and Persian subjects who have recently arrived from Russia, whence they had fled owing to the intention of the authorities to compel them to enter military service and other persecutions. ' . 8 - Persian and German intrigues. —The proposed elections for the national assembly are claiming much attention in democrat circles, and formed the chief topic of conversation in their meetings this week. Our communiques were also discussed, and various schemes for counteracting their effect were proposed ; none of which were considered satisfactory. A reference was then made to our reception described above, and it was suggested that there had been a revolution in England and the day of rejoicing was held to cover this new disaster. Finally a pamphlet recently written in praise of the British waspublicly read and commented upon : the author being freely abused by the more extreme portion of the assembly. Generally speaking, however, our news is believed, and the communiques are in very great demand throughout the province. 9. News from Turbat-i-Haidar i. —Our Agent reports that some few of the prisoners captured in the recent campaign against the rebel Aziz-ullah have been left behind at Turbat: the object being apparently to hang them there as a warning to the local people. 10. News from Karaiz.-—T\iQ two sons of Shuja-ul-Mulk who were recently married at Meshed (paragraph 10 of Diary No. 39) have arrived at Karaiz, where their arrival was the signal for further festivities and rejoicings. 11 . Influenza is still rife in this neighbourhood, and many people are said to have died from its effects. 12. News from Herat.—The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered a flag to be hoisted over the Customs Offices, and has announced his intention of being present at the ceremony to be observed on the occasion. 13. The arrival at Herat is reported of a few Jews from Russian territory. They say that they have been plundered by the Russians of all their possessions. 14. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered special arrangements to be made for the transport to Herat of revenue grain from all parts of the province. 15. Kazim Beg and the Maulvi Barkat-ullah called on the Naib-ul- Hukumah on the 28th ultimo and conversed with him on the subject of the war as usual. One of them remarked that German troops would soon reach the have fallen upon deaf ears ; time. The conversation then Naib remarked that it was a Afghan frontier, but the suggestion seems to perhaps because it was not made for the first turned upon the epidemic of influenza, and the war disease which had appeared first in France. 16, Two of the Russian refugees at Bagh-i-Shiwan appear to have incurred the displeasure of the Naib-ul-Hukumah by suggesting that he should find some work for them and for the wife of one of them who is a lady-doctor. These requests were very curtly refused: the husband of the lady-doctor being told that the Afghans would kill his wife should she attempt to work among them. 17. The death of one reported on the 1 st instant, for his burial. of the Russian Permission was given refugees at Bagh-i-Shiwan was by the Naib-ul-Hukumah 18. On the same day von Gruden informed his servants, who have apparently become anxious regarding their pay, which they have not received for a considerable time, that Persia had declared war against the Allies, and that America had withdrawn from further participation in the struggle. 19. On the 2 nd instant von Gruden attended the funeral of the dead Russian at Bagh-i-Shiwan. It was noticed that on leaving Bagh-i-Kartah he locked and sealed his room—for the first time it is belie ;ed. 20. On the same day Saiyid Riza stated that the British Consulate Gene ral had been raided by the Persians at Meshed—this is also the first time that such a report has been made by the German party. 21 . Two of the Russian refugees with their wives left the Bagh-i-Shiwan to return to Russian territory, with the leave of the Naib-ul-Hukumah, on the 4th instant. . Our Agent has secured a photograph of the parly of Russian refugees, which he has sent in with his last report. They appear to be a mixed collec tion of officials and private individuals of a harmless character; and in all probability are merely wffiat they give themselves out to be. W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. Meshed ; ^ The l&amp;th October 1918. ) SGPI, Delhi—490 F&amp;PD —18-11-18—30-CONFIDENTIAL. . [ ! y r y ^ I ^ 1 I (t J ; ” x , o Meshed Diary No. 42 for the week ending the 19th October 1918. 1. Persian officials. —Major Sjoberg, the Commissioner of Police, complains to us^ that a dismissed commissary by name Ghulam Husain Khan, who was dismissed for his democratic tendencies, has been, through the intercession of the Peshkar Amid-us-Saltanah, appointed to be commissary of Sabzawar. This is a place of some importance and steps will be taken to have him removed. 2. Ahmad Ali Khan (paragraph 5 of Diary No. £9) has returned from Sarakhs on completion of his mission, which seems to have been merely to enquire and report upon the actual position as regards the Turkomans and their intentions, as the Governor-General had told me. The Persian Govern ment complain that at the boundary settlement in which the division of Russian and Persian Sarakhs was made the Russians contrived to obtain as part of their share the whole of the water-supply of both divisions ; and the Kawwam makes no secret to me of their hope that the matter will soon be adjusted, through our good offices, in a more equitable manner. 3. The improvements in connection with the tomb of Nadir Shah men tioned in paragraph 3 last week are somewhat affecting the popularity of the Kawwam-us-Saltanah, on account, no doubt, of the somewhat drastic manner in which they are being carried out. We have done what is possible to relieve hardship by inducing the Ka'wwam to make satisfactory provision for the people summarily ejected from their quarters. T. Persian affairs {local). —The ’ Ashura, or tenth day of Muharram passed off quietly. Owing to recent sickness in the city the attendance at the proces sions, etc., was less than usual. Excellent arrangements were made by the police; and the conduct of our troops was beyond praise, as usual. 5. Persian affiairs {general). —The province is quiet: no reports of robbery or outrage have been received during the week. 6 . Pritish affairs. —The repair of the Meshed-Askabad road is progressing satisfactorily, Major Bingham, who is in charge of the operations, has asked for 1,000 labourers, and the Governor-General has directed the acting Governor of Kuchan to provide them. The Governor has replied that the number is rather large in view of the harvesting work which still continues and the amount of sickness there has been recently in the neighbourhood, but that he will provide as many as possible. Meanwhile the Karguzar of Kuchan has telegraphed to his chief at Meshed asking for instructions. - '■ 7. In a Muharram mourning meeting in the house of Haji Saiyid Asad- ullah Mujtahid, at which the Attache of this consulate was present, general approval was expressed of us and our conduct in Khorassan : but a Kaini who was among the gathering remarked that we had confiscated certain endowment property at Kain. He was invited to come to us and state his grievance in due form. 8 . The greatest interest continues to be taken in our communiques, which from day to day are anxiously awaited and passed on from house to house. One Haji Saiyid Abbas Mujtahid was heard to say in another Muharram meeting that he neither believed what the friends of the British said nor the statements of their enemies, but that he could not help seeing the difference in the conduct of the foreign troops that had been brought to Persia. He then ? referred to the bombardment of the Meshed Shrine by the Russians, and the recent atrocities committed by the Turkish troops in Tabriz ; and ended his remarks by reminding those present that since British forces had occupied Khorassan no one had made a complaint against them of any importance. 9. Russian affairs. —Permission has been received to release the Caucasian doctor, Nasir Begov, on security (paragraph 12 of Diary No. 39)H ^ the necessary security, and we are assured that this act ot clemency wm the best effect and will not be taken for weakness. , . The Caucasians are quiet, and acting under our advice ave c ose r committee meetings for the present. , . . f 10 . Mv colleague has unsuccessfully tried to obtain the permission of the Persian Government to the export of Exists ^here owing neiohbourin' country. We have, however, succeeded m arranging this matter She Governor-General, who asks that kerosme oil may be received in exchange for this consignment of gram. 11. Persian and German -Three Turkish prisoners escap^ from confinement in the Ark on the night of the 17th instant. As thm followed unon the escape of two, three weeks ago, it was necessary to take some serious notice of the occurrence. The remaining Turks in confinement have now been removed to the more secure prison of the Nazmiah, where they are being interrogated as to their relations, if any exist, which seems to be h My, witl democrat or other sympathisers m the city. His Highness the Governor General has also telegraphed to all stations in the province ordering the arres and return to Meshed of the fugitives should they attempt to make their w y to Tehran or elsewhere. It is believed that these men effected their escape by bribing the police guard, and the policemen on guard at the time have also been incarcerated and are being interrogated. , _ _ i 12 The arrival of seven Austrian refugees at Kalat is reported. ^ I have asked the Governor-General to have them sent in to Meshed which is being done accordingly. It is also said that two Turks have reached Sarakhs, and these will also be sent in should the report be correct. At the request of General Malleson eight Armenians and a few Russians who had arrived at Sarakhs en route to Meshed, are being sent in under escort. The Russians are said to be Bolsheviks. 13. A meeting of local democrats took place on the night ot the 7 th of Muharram: merely, it seemed, to announce that no further meetings would be held for the present. . 14 News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—The complicated affair mentioned in naragraph 14 of Diary No. 40 has not yet reached a satisfactory solution Sirdar Muazzam has telegraphed to onr Agent, who has inspected the copy of the agreement come to between him and his representative Haji Amm which provides for the payment of all taxes by the Sirdar. Meanwhile the Persian Be venue Department has not yet realised the duty on the produce of the lands, and our troops are taking possession of the amount of gram paid for by them. 15. Nem from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jbm.-Habib-ullah Khan, brother of Shaii-us-Saltanah, who has been placed in charge of the Taimuns at Jam during his brother’s absence as Governor of Sarakhs, has come to collect 10(1 sowars to assist in operations on the frontier at Sarakhs, and will proceed thither with them when collected. 16. News from Karaiz. —Our Agent has been occupied in cleaning and otherwise preparing the quarters recently occupied by the Bussian sanitary post for the reception of our troops, and arrangements for the purchase ot grain from Shuja-ul-Mulk have been in progress. 17 News from Herat. —Herat is now reported to be clear of inffuenza, but there is much still in the neighbouring villages and many deaths have occurred including that of the Governor of Ghor. 18 Applications have been received by the Naib-ul-Hukumah from certain Turkomans now at Dahana-i-Zulfikar who sent a deputation to represent them asking for permission to emigrate to Afghanistan. They have been informed that it will be necessary for them to proceed to Kabul, and have returned to Zulfikar to consult their filends., r19. Maulvi Barkat-ullak has applied to the Naib-ul-Eukumah for winter clothing for himself, Kazim Beg, and the Austrians; and the Naib has ordered the usual arrangements to be made 20. Von Gruden has prevailed upon the Naib-ul-HuJcumah to dismiss the Captain of his guard and to re-appoint the former commander. 21. On the 8 th instant Nasr-ullah made enquiries regarding arrivals from Kain ; saying that he wished to know what the condition of affairs there was at present. 22. On the same day our Agent visited the Naib-ul-Huhumah who shewed him the plan of the bridge known as Pul-i-Malan, and remarked that some of the Russian refugees were good engineers, and that he was glad to have the chance of utilising their services. 23. The Naib-ul-B-ukumah paid a visit of condolence to the wife of the Russian refugee whose death was reported in paragraph 17 last week. The lady informed him that she did not wish to stay in Afghanistan but would prefer to go to Askabad via Meshed. The Naib remarked that there was fighting at Askabad, but the lady replied that nobody would hurt her, and after some further discussion it was decided that the Naib should make arrange ments for the journey to Meshed. When the Naib was returning to the city some of the Russians approached him and announced their desire to be received into the faith of Islam. The Naib at first tried to dissuade them by pointing out that they would never be able to return to their former religion on pain of death ; and finally told them to give the matter further consideration. 21. Von Gruden .has ejected the supposed German, Atrab, from his quarters, saying that he is not a German but a Russian. The man has returned to Bagh-i-Shiwan. 25. The Russian refugees have leave to sell the arms they brought with them : the Government officers having the first refusal to purchase. 26. News from Turkestan and Trans-Caspia. —Serious fighting has taken, place on the frontier, following upon the capture of Dushakh by our troops and the Mensheviks. The present position seems to be that we are in possession of Dushakh. The Governor of Sarakhs, Sbaji-us-Saltanah, has expressed a fear of an attack by Bolsheviks upon Sarakhs. This is not very likely, but the Governor- General is sending up 100 sowars to co-operate in case of necessity, and Shaji will also have the hundred which are coming with his brother from Jam {vide paragraph 15 above).

The week has passed quietly. The enemv has withdrawn In's trains to and behind Eu^hakh, an 1 the Transcaspian force undertook some repair of the line towards Armansasad with little Opposition. An aeroplane ex 33- ku which has joined the Iranscasnian force has undertaken reconnaissance W( rk and caused some panic among the enemy by dropping bombs in the vicinity of his trains. It is reported that the enemy is d scouraged and rhat his troops were with difficulty induced to attack on the ISth instant. 324. I*r&lt; vinces. —-Anarchy continues around Astrahad owing to Turkoman plundering. Reports have^been received of the activity of Turdsh and German agents on the Caspian littoral in the S. E. angle, and of their attempts to eommunicate with Yoniud Turkoman not only in Persian but also iu Russian territory. Measures for the arrest of local Turkish agentr. are being taken in Darngiz. Intrigues are apparently rife against the recently appointed pro-British Governor of that region, Mu’tamid-iil-Wuznra. 325. Local —A Caucasian, Doctor Nas rhekov, an exponent of pro Turk and anti-British propaganda has been arrested at Meshed. Some 30 to 40 Caucasians have recently arrived from Asknhad. Their arrival is attributed partly to the arrest at Askhahad by the Transcaspian authorities of a Caucasian acting in Turkish interests, and partly to fear of being conscripted to fight against the Bolsheviks. A party of nine Turks, apparently escaped prisoners of war from Russian territory, are on their way to Meshed from Sarakhs. Herat and Afghanistan. 326. Germans and adherents .—Little news of interest is to hand regarding the Turco-German party this week. The Austrians have been in communication with the Russian refugees who had not yet started for Kabul. 327. Military.—Owing to the severity of the influenza epidemic and the incidence of the Md, the usual military darbar was not held and no work has been carried out. Russian Turkistan. 328. Current Bolshevik atrocities behind their front are freely reported, the most reliable account being that of a Commissary recently operating against Kushk. Merv town is said to have been gutted and the corpses of murdered Turkoman to be lying in the streets. Native arrivals from Tejen stated that the shops had been burnt. Fear is expressed that Tashkent will bethe scene of similar brutalities, Kolesov having assured Tiotsky^ that energetic steps to stamp out counter-revolution were being taken. The classes most likely to suffer are the so-called bourgeoisie and in particular the officer class. At the same time evidence is adduced of the straits to which the Bolshevik authorities are being reduced, both pecuniarily and materially. They are said to he in want of ammunition particularly artillery. The lavish expenditure^ with little result in recent fights does not go to bear this out. At the same time it must be considered that thev have little or no chance of replacing ammunition expended, and it is far from improbable that their warriors find a free if in accurate expenditure of artillery ammunition preferable to much exposure of their persons in assault. As matters stand the grain and food question for Transcaspia, cut off as they are from the fertile Mery and Tejen cases, presents considerable difficulty. Meshed; ') A. P.

British force—No movep of importance. Kahka front. The week has passed quietly, the Bolshevik making no offer to attack. The detachment of levies reached Kahka early in the week. . 33 °* Enemy prisoners. The batch of 73 prisoners, including Austrian prisoners was despatched to Turbat-i-Haidari on the 1 st instant for India, borne casualties occurred to the hired fourgons in which they were conveyed on the 1 st March, but apparently without serious consequences. 33i* Provinces. The main interest is centred on the South-East Caspian littoral and the adjoimng Yomut country. Considerable Turkoman unrest un doubtedly prevails and from many reports received Turkish influence has achieved some success. It is supposed that the landing of even a small Turkish detach ment would be sufficient to bring in a number of these people. On the other hand inter-tribal strife is also alleged. In this connection the demeanour of the Khan of Bujnurd is open to some suspicion. The Russian Bank has received notice that their branch at Barfrush contemplate evacuation owing to Turkoman unrest and similar reports regarding the Russian colony at Bandar-i-Gaz have come to hand. The Persian Yomut are in close connection with those in Russian terri tory, and the raids of the latter on small Russian settlements on the border have rot ceased. An unfortunate feature in the situation is the non-existence of the Russian posts which formerly maintained order in the frontier region. The departure of certain suspicious persons purporting to be Tehranis from Bujnurd towards Kuchan or Askhabad is reported. 332 . Local. The nine Turkish prisoners, noted last week, have arrived at Meshed and have been taken charge of by the Governor-General. Two Turkish prisoners of those confined in the Ark have escaped. The Caucasian community who were much elated by the fall of Baku were recently correspondingly depressed by a rumour ot the Turkish evacuation of that town which has reached them. Communiques of British success in Palestine have so far left them unmoved, but it is possible that their scepticism may receive a rude shock. An escaped Hungarian prisoner of war was recently arrested by our troops. 333- Bermans and adherents.—L\tt\e of interest is to hand regarding Kazim Beg and his friends. There would appear to be an intrigue against him of which von Gruden is a supporter, the object being to put on Kazim Beg’s instigation the fighting between Turkoman and Bolsheviks in the Kushk area, and the consequent loss of life to the Turkoman. Von Gruden appears to have been obtaining signatures to a round robin to this effect. Considering the highly Teutonic leaven of the present Kushk garrison such action on the part of Kazim would appear most improbable. 334 . Refugees.—h Russian engineer and his wife were started off for Kabul on the 21 st ultimo. Some 8 other Russians have reached Herat. The Russian engineers at Herat have submitted a model of the proposed new Pul-i-Malan for the Naib-ul-Hukumah’s approval, and a photograph of this is to be sent to the Amir. The Herat Russians have expressed Bolshevik sympathies ; presumably Khorasan and N. E.

They have so tar iauc heartedly the more intelligent class. Reoorts from various sources testify to the commission of Bolshevik atrocities at mL P Teien, and Dushakh, a recent arrival from Meiw states that the tow n is now relatively quiet, no signs of the recent reprisals of th^Bokl^ population were cowed, but so great was the umversal detesta or of the. « - viks that he remarked ‘ even the dogs wou:d fiy at them if thry k°t &gt;1 ‘ &lt;b^t_- He could give no information as to the fate of the Turkoman chief., bcjond tlat they had fled. With the re-opening of the Kushk line the B Isbevik have been able to bring up ordnance and stores, including intrenching implements trom the f ortress. The shortage of Tashkent is evidenced by a recent request to Kushk to supply ur gently medical requisites which were totally wanting at the capita • e D £a 'l fontributions in money, grain and live-stock have been laid on the Turkoman of Merv, Yolatan, and Takhta Bazar as a punishment for their opposition to the Bolshevik advance. The Bolsheviks are by some accounts reported to be exceedingly short of liquid fuel for the railway, and the number of trains to have been considerab y cur tailed in consequence. A report from Tashkent, dared the 14 th September which succeeded in get ting through, mentions the arrival of the Kashgar mission at Tashkent, the grow ing Bolshevik suspicion of them, and the constraint which was finally put upon them. It was recently reported from Transcaspia that a body of Bolsheviks from Astrachan with a very large amount of ammunition and stores hdd succeeded in landing some 60 miles north of Fort Alexandrovsk with the intention of making ther way overland to Tashkent. Nothing further has, however, been heard 0 this adventure. E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel, G. S. 0. L MeSHeD ; 5th October 1918. y 1CONFIDENTIAL. 4 * i r- r *5 O ii i Meshed Diary No. 36, for the week ending the 7th September, 1918. L Persian officials .—The Government of Khaf has been added to that of Gunabad, the Governor of the former locality, Nusrat-ul-Mulk, taking them both under his charge. This step has been taken on account of the constant trouble at Gunabad between the orthodox Shias and the Sufi sect of whom it is said that they now pay more attention to worldly gain than to their religious duties. 2. Riza Khan, the late Governor of Darajaiz, has arrived in Meshed. Every thing is now reported to be going well at Darajaiz under the Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah, but the local people are said to be afraid of an attack by the Bolsheviks. 3. Persian affairs {local ).—Under instructions from His Majesty’s Minister I have restrained the Kawwam-us-Saltanah from publishing the proclamation on the subject of elections for the National Assembly (paragraph 3 last week). He agrees that it is not advisable to hold elections at present, owing to the uncertainty of securing a majority favourable to the existing regime. 4. Influenza still rages not only in the city but also in the outlying- districts. It has several varieties, but the duration of the disease is in most cases limited to three or four days. 5. Persian affairs {general ).—Nothing further has yet been heard of the Sirdar Intisar and his mission to Turshiz (paragraph 6 last week). The province generally is quiet. 6. British affairs.— Mr. B. J. Gould, I.C.S., arrived at Meshed on the 5th instant on a visit to this Consulate. Cn the same day Captain Geidt, 107th Pioneers, reported his arrival for service with the new Khcrassan Le\y Corps which is in course of formation. Some recruits have come in during the week, and deputations have been sent out on recruiting duty ; but at present there is difficulty in this connection as mentioned last week. 7. At a religious meeting held during the week remarks favourable to the British were made and well received by those present. It was said that the British had delivered the Meshed public from great suffering by pushing on their trade to replace that of Russia, and another speaker pointed out how many lives had been saved by our famine relief work. Yet another who had recently come from India remarked upon the satisfactory condition of affairs there due to British rule, and informed the company that the large majority of the people of India were happy and contented. Many indications point to a growth of feeling in our favour here. 8. A secret telegram has been received from the Karguzar of Turbat-i-Haidari by the Karguzar of Meshed reporting that the British have detailed 150 men from their troops to work upon the Turbat-Meshed road and make it fit for automobile traffic. The reason for this is given as a desire to facilitate the passage of troops. 9. On the afternoon of the 5th instant, in consequence of reports received, I paid a surprise visit to the premises occupied by Safdar Beg, a Caucasian Turk who represents in Meshed the Baku firm of Taqiov. This Taqiov has a reputation as an enthusiast in the cause of pan-Islamism, and is supposed to be now working in this connection for the Turks and to have exhorted his representatives to do likewise. It had been reported that Safdar Beg was in communication with the firm’s agent in Askabad, and that he was furnishing for enemy information reports on the strength of our military position here from the time to time. The recent correspondence of Safdar Beg with the Baku house was examined The last communication that had been received was dated the 20th April, and amounted to nothing more than a request for a statement of accounts in connection2 with consignments of thread which the Meshed Branc K h J ia b d r ® C £t re a byThl informed bv Safdar Beg that the Baku establishment had been plundered oytne Bolsheviks m March last' and that the unfortunate Taqiov h“ of all he possessed, including his balances at hanks and «' ts ‘“ d ' n S ■;^ |sbe ^ | . remarked that in all probability the telegram of April 20th was sent ^der Bo instructions We discovered that there had been no agent of the firm at Askabad for several years, and no trace of seditious correspondence with that or any other place was to be found. The conclusion arrived at after a lengthy conversation was that Safdar Beg sariSUfTSHSH &lt;G££ SSS2 s» ~ d—»»« s.”' £ •£••£# fnZV£' p come to Meshed to work for pamlslamism, and to have been ejected from he position of president of tlJ committee partly because the majority of th» mimbers were not in sympathy with the movement He has also been heard recently to make remarks highly uncomplimentary to us, and our pro pects in the war. The desirability of his arrest is being considered. 10 I have received from M. Guerra, the loyal and useful Manager of the Russian Banque d’Escompte in Meshed, a cordial note of sympathy on the death of Lieutenant Ward at the hands of the Bolsheviks (paragraph 29 last week). In this note the deceased officer is described as a hero, and his death m action as a horrible crime for which it is hoped that just retribution will fall on the enemy. 11 Russian affairs.— Sly colleague has again complained against the Karguzar, and a telegram has been received by the latter asking for an explanation to hi sent to the Foreign Office. He has replied to the effect that the complaints asainst him are not the result of any shortcoming on his part but are due to M Kaal, the acting first secretary, whose ideas of the settlement of cases between Persian and Russian subjects are that the decision should always be given in favour of his own man. (There is undoubtedly truth in this.) 12 The Karguzar of Sarakhs telegraphs information of the arrival of large numbers of Turkomans and other refugees from Russian territory. He reports that the Customs officials extort unauthorised fees from these people, and remarks fW all f.bp Turkomans desire to become Persian subjects. The Governor-General informed me on the 31st ultimo that he had received a report from the Governor of Sarakhs that some Turkomans had offered to Persia, through the local authorities, the possession of Russian Sarakhs on condition that they be received and protected as Persian subjects. His Excellency asked what he should do, and I advised him to refer the matter to Tehran as it seemed to me that acceptance of the proposal would place the Persian Government m a dangerous position. 13 The Karguzar of Bujnurd telegraphs that certain officials of the Trans caspian Government have come to buy grain ; and he recommends that they should not be allowed to take any out of Persia. The question has been referred to Tehran. (Information just received intimates that the Chief of Bujnurd has accorded to Major Daukes a fitting reception—see paragraph 10 last week.) 14. Persian and German intrigues .—Despondency now reigns in democrat circles here. In the meeting this week regret was expressed on account of the present police arrangements, and it was said that the society had now no influence in the police office. The growth of British popularity was again referred to : our famine relief work being, as usual, given as the principal cause for that. It was decided to counteract, as far as possible, the effect of our communiques and accounts of British victories by making them out to be false, and to make people understand that we do not publish our frequent defeats by the enemy. Our special democrat reported has been to Tehran on a mission to the Central Committee there. He reports that he found matters bad from the society’s pointof view. They complain of being able to get nothing done on account of the frequent change of Ministers, and are not able to bring about the selection of t leir own choices for the various offices of Government. The messenger appears to have explained to the Committee the split in democrat circles here, and to have intimated to them the men who were no longer to be considered as loyal to the principles of democracy as understood m Persia ihe Committee seem to have thrown cold water upon the suggestion to send letters to the Amirs of Bokhara and Afghanistan; and it has been abandoned for the moment. 15. News from #aratz.—Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakharz has been asked to send both sowars and footmen to join in the expedition against Aziz-uiiah (paragraph 6 last week) : and has replied that he has no footmen but will send some sowqrs. 16. News from Herat.— The Naib-ul-Hukumah has dismissed the Governor of Gulran on account of the many reports he has received against him, and has appointed in his place the late Governor of Sabzawar. 17. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has forbidden the export of wool and carpets for the present, and has taken the opportunity at the same time to issue a warning against smuggling. 18. The arrival of seven more families of deportees from Kabul is reported. As usual, these have been granted Jands to cultivate. 19 Two Arabs arrived on the 27th ultimo from Mazar-i-Sharif They claim to be natives of Medina, who came to Bokhara 5 years ago ; and say that they now wish to return to their home via Persia. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has given orders for them to be entertained at Chahar Bagh at Government expense. He consi ders that, as there is no order in Persia, it would be dangerous for them to proceed. 20. On the 24th von Gruden ordered his camels to be brought in from the pas ture land to which they had been sent, and directed that they should be taken daily for walking exercise in order that they might become fit for a journey. 21. On the same day von Gruden was asked why he did not invite the newly arrived German (paragraph 27 last week) to stay with him and he replied that he did not wish him to become acquainted with his work, and that of the German party, at Herat. 22 Kazim Beg, Puri Khan and Haji Ahmad, have all been attacked with fever since their arrival from the frontier. 23. Yon Gruden has had the door of his room at Bagh-i-Kartah strengthened. possibly he suspects some attack upon his quarters. 24 Seven of the Russian men now at Shiwan visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah at Ohahar Bagh on the 27th ultimo. . After they had discussed with him some un important domestic matters he asked them why none of them had learned Per sian or Pashtu adding that the English had officials who know both well. They r a f-u f TWiGi had received orders to learn the languages as their Gov- IntltLtntifutonateiy ^X possession of Afghanistan, but that the Rus Tn Government had had no such intention and therefore no such instructions were issued to them. 25 It seems that the man who accompanied Kazim Beg on his return journey from the fronUer (paragraph 22 last week) was a Caucasian Turk named Muham- a n Lli Tbp ^prvants at Bagh-i-Kartah have incurred the displeasure of the SlStkSlirC diuS » wait upo» .hi. p.~n owing to h,. »«»- perance. 26. von Gruden announced his intention on the 28th of establishing wireless communication with Kabul. 97 On the same day a Russian officer of some distinction with a wife and two daught'era arrivedTt Shiwan from the frontier. He has two servants and came in with 5 camel loads of property.4 28 It was reported on the 30th ultimo that Saiyid Ahmad Beg Jamshidi, had been arrested on the Bussian frontier, but no particulars are yet to hand. On the same day our Agent heard that it was decided to expel Muhammad Oghli from Afghanistan, but no definite information of this has come m. 29 News from Turkestan and Transcaspia .—No further fighting of importance has occurred at Kahka, and Meshed inhabitants are more at ease since they consi der that the immediate danger of a Bolshevik invasion of Persia has passed oft. The very large majority are pleased to hear of British successes. Meshed ; W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General The 7th September 1918. \ and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. t G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C470FD.' 1 —5»10-18—30— M.D.CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 37, for the week ending the 14th September 1918. 1 . Persian officials. —Nusrat-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Khaf and Gnnabad (paragraph 1 last week) left for the former place on the 11 th instant. He has received orders to make Gunabad his headquarters for the present in view of the Shia and Sufi trouble there. 2 . The Governor-General arrested Shahzadah Mustafa Mirza, the late Govern or of Turshiz, desiiing to make him disgorge the sum of tinmans 22,000 which he is alleged to have extorted from the people of Turshiz during the period of his government. He has been released on security. 3. Persian affairs (local). —The editor of the “ Bahar ” has petitioned the Governor-General and myself for the resumption of the publication of his journal (paragraph 12 of Diary No. 34), making the usual promises of good be haviour in future. We have decided not to consider the question until a represent ative body of the editor’s democrat friends have called upon me to offer a suffi cient apology. 4. The epidemic of influenza mentioned last week continues, but is showing signs of dying out. There have been rumours of both plague and cholera in the town during the week, but happily both were found to be without foundation. 5. Persian affairs (general).—It is reported that Aziz-ullah, the Turshiz rebel (paragraph 5 last week), has fled to Rig in the direction of Kirman with a number of sowars that is variously estimated at from 20 to 300. It is probable that he has with him about 30. According to the latest reports he is being pursued by the Sardar Intisar and his men : it is not known how far they have got. 6. It is said that much grain is being exported from the north-western portion of Khorassan to the neighbouring country inhabited by the Yamut Turkomans, and that it is being sent thence to an enemy force. Thelocal Customs Department confirms this report, and says that the grain is exchanged for rifles, the property of Armenians of Askabad. The matter is receiving attention. 7. British affairs. —Lieutenant Williams, Mechanical Tranfsport Corps, arrived at this Consulate on the 8 th and left for Turbat-i-Haidari on the 11 th instant. 8. It appears that Major Daukes (paragraph 13 last week) while on his way to Bujnurd interviewed the famous robber chief Khuddu near Shirwan. The chief is reported to have applied to enter British^ service, but as his relations with the new administration are as yet undecided it would be difficult to engage him at present. A report submitted by the Karguzar of Shirwan states that he entertained Major Daukes and his men for 24 hours, and that he offered a horse to Major Daukes which the latter declined with thanks. 9. Russian affairs —Orders have been received for the arrest of Dr. Nasir Begov to be carried out. This man came to Meshed from Askabad about a year ago, ostensibly to practise medicine, but incidentally to spread pan-Islamic pro paganda. He was at first elected to the presidency of the local Caucasian Com mittee, to which community he belongs, but was soon after ejected from that posi tion in favour of Mir Murtaza, partly on account of private diflerences and partly because the majority of the committee were not in sympathy with the pan-Islamic movement. He has recently been heard to make dmaraging remarks concering the British, and shows that his sympathies are not p'o-Ally. It has been decided to arrest him the day before a party of enemy agents who have recently been sent in to Meshed from Transcaspia leaves Meshed, in order to avoid unpleasantness. He wdll then proceed to India with the party men tioned. mxx F'/iaad ZLC$r:i%T$ &gt; tout*?. No 78 9 s 18 OCT 1318 ; 20 MOV 4,218' 'E ^ 10. The Persian Government have refused a request from my colleague for the export of grain to Askabad. The Governor-General to whom this request was made referred it to T^^ran, but the reply was firm that no grain should on any account be exported. 11. Persian and German intrigues.—Vaz democrat committee apparently cannot make up its mind regarding the condition on which the “ Bahar ” is to be allowed to resume publication. The members have done their best to induce the Kawwam-us-Saltanah to allow the resumption without my acquiescence, but His Excellency has stood firm. It is now suggested to bring out some new peri odical in place of the “Bahar.” 12. Saiyid Kasim Isfahani, and Muhammad Karim Beg Kurdistani, have recently come from Bokhara. They represent the Amir to be inclined towards the cause of pan-Islamism, and state that he has recently made certain enquiries as to the attitude of the Shias of Persia towards the three Khalifas, and other disputed points, with a view to a rapprochement. This information is, however, not believed by the democrats, and no attention is given to the matter. 13. When the agent mentioned in paragraph 14 last week was in Tehran he * was asked to induce the democrats of Meshed to buy three thousand rifles, the price of which should be paid at the convenience of the purchasers, by instalments if preferred. This proposal was laid before the local committee during the past week, but it was rejected for the present owing to the probability of the confiscation of the arms by us. One member suggested that the Aghazadah be applied to for assistance in the matter. 14. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —The new Governor is giving satisfaction generally, and our agent speaks warmly of the help that he receives from him. The arrival of 23 motor cars carrying Lewis guns is reported. (This party is under the command of Lieutenant Williams, mentioned above.) 15. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Captain Preston, S.P.R., left for Karaiz on September the 3rd, and the sons of Shuja-ul-Mulk with their party passed through on the 9th, en route for Meshed. 16. News from Karaiz. —Captain Preston arrived on the 4th instant. He was well received, and lunched with the Governor, Shuja-ul-Mulk, at Yusufabad, near Karaiz, on the 6th. On the afternoon of the same day he left for Kirman via Karat on the Khaf road. . 17. News from Herat. —The Arabs mentioned in paragraph 19 last week have been given a generous present by the Naib-ul-Hukumah and have left for Meshed with a recommendatory letter to the Afghan Agent here, Abdullah Khan. 18. A letter was brought to the Naib-ul-Hukumah from the same Abdullah Khan on the 31st ultimo, reporting that 60 families of Hazara residents of Persia wished to return to their former homes in Afghanistan. Permission was given for their repatriation. (It is not known which families these are, but enquiries will be made.) 19. An unfortunate wretch was stoned to de ath on the 4th instant by order of the local Government for the crime of a Kufr ”, or infidelity. 20. On the 31st ultimo the Naib-ul-Hukumah was visited by the Russian “ general ” who had recently arrived at Herat. At the close of the interview the Naib who had been told by the officer that he was a royalist, declined to allow his guest to visit Kazim. The Russian was informed that he would have to leave Herat in about ten .days’ time. 21 . Notwithstanding the objection of the Naib-ul-Hukumah two of the Rus sians located at Shirwan visited Kazim Beg on the evening of the 2 nd, and remained t with him for about two hours. It is not known what passed at the interview. 22. On the 4th instant Asghar, Kazim Beg’s servant, announced that his \ master during his recent visit to the frontier had induced certain Turkomans to become Turkish subjects, and promised to take them under his protection.mm******** M II 1.1 II.

On the same day the Russians were refused leave to correspond with their friends in Russia by the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 24. The servants of the German party were heard to say on the 6 th that their masters gave them receipts in lieu of pay, and that they understood that the money would only be paid to them in the event of a German victory in the war. 25. News from Turkistan and Transcaspia. —The enemy attacked our force at Kahka several times on the 11 th instant, but with no success, as on no occasion did they reach our trenches. We captured two guns, and our total loss amounted to two wounded. They have made no further attempt since. The Bolsheviks have asked certain Turkoman chiefs to make peace offering to give their deputation a safe conduct to Tejen under a white flag. The Turko mans have not yet replied. The arrival of large numbers of Armenian refugees from Baku is reported at Askabad. Meshed, The 14th September, 1918. W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan.CONFIDENTIAL Vr'v :r' fVl '% ! Q 10 Meshed Diary No. 38 for the week ending the 21st September 1918. 1. Persian officials.— r Y\iQ Dabir-us-Sultan, Governor of S^bsawar, has resigned his post and returned to Meshed. He announces his intention of retiring again into private life from which he had only been induced to emerge as a tempo rary measure to fill a post which was of importance for the moment. He will probably be replaced by the Adal-ud-Daulah, who, though not stong enough for the post at Turbat-i-Haidari, will do all right at Sabsawar where the circumstances have changed for the better. 2. Iktidar-ul-Mulk is appointed as Governor of Kalat, Ashja’-ul-Mulk (para graph 2 of Diary No. 34) having resigned. This man’s family have always been on the best of terms with this Consulate, and the appointment is satisfactory. The family is of Afghan origin. 3. Persian affairs (fom/).—Ibrahim Agha, and Ghulam Husain Khan, town police Commissaries, have been dismissed being democrats and unable to work with the present regime or to accept the training and drill that are now being imposed upon all the police staff. 4. The question of the “ Bahar ” is still under consideration. The democrat leader, Haji Muhammad Ja’far Kashmiri, has proposed an interview with me in the house of a mutual friend, and this will probably take place during the coming week (paragraph 3 last week). 5. Our Attache was told by the Karguzar some days ago that the declaration *of war by Persia against Turkey was under consideration by the Tehran Govern ment, but the Kawwam-us-Saltanah, to whom I mentioned this yesterday, laughed, and said that he had heard nothing about it. 6. The health of the city has somewhat improved, but there is now a mild epidemic of some form of enteritis which was at first suspected to be cholera. The influenza has spread to Turbat-i-Jam and its neighbourhood, where it is unfortunately interfering with our levy recruiting. It does not last, however. 7. Persian affairs {general ).—The Kawwam announced to me yesterday with pardonable satisfaction the capture of the rebel Aziz-ullah with two followers at Kuh-i-Paighambar in Sar Walayat by the men of Nusrat Lashkar of Shahrud and some Sabsawar sowars. It appears that he had fled with 30 men only (paragraph 5 last week). Orders are being issued for the despatch of Aziz-ullah to Meshed, and the Sirdar Ihtisar is instructed to return with the Persian troops without delay. 8. The Ma’tamid-ul-Wazarah, assisted by Abd-us-Samad Shah, continues to give complete satisfaction at Dara jaiz ; and the Chief of Bujnurd expresses himself much pleased with Major Daukes’ visit. 9. British affairs. —Mr. Gould (paragraph 6 of Diary No. 36) left Meshed for Birjand via Turbat-i-Shahikh Jam on the 16th instant. 10. Shaikh Inayat-ullah, the e^-democrat preacher, has again enlightened his congregation in regard to the real intentions of the British in Persia. He urges them not to believe the false report that scarcity in their country was caused by us, and points out the true state of the case, that scarcity is brought about by those owners of grain who withhold their stocks from sale in order to cause a rise in prices. The preacher added some remarks in praise of the conduct of British troops. 11. It is reported that the Chief Astrologer of Tehran has prophesied the annihilation of the British Government which is to take place next year; the return to Persia of the ecc-Shah Muhammad Ali in the year following; and finally the rise in A. H. 1340 of the world-conquering Mahdi. These prophesies have been sent to the Head Astrologer in Meshed who has read them in a public meeting. . e : v&lt;r/- . M ■■ , , * • v ’ im f t f , „; r f WH 'I;: II 1 ; li !! 1 1 I #• U 1 i lii'ii ■ 12 . We have received further requests from Caucasian Turks to become British subjects notwithstanding that we told them plainly enough some months ago that such a change was not possible. The incapacity of Mr. Nicolsky to support their claims, and the general condition of affairs in Russia/are responsible for the movement, for which it is impossible to feel no sympathy. 13. Russian affairs. —We have been considerably annoyed recently by various attempts on the part of individuals in Askabad, and also in Meshed, to export forbidden articles from this country under the plea that they are required for the use of British troops. The Customs department have very strict orders on the subject of exports at present, and we have had some difficulty in arranging with them for the articles that our troops really need : this difficulty has been largelv increased by the irregular conduct of our Russian friends, particularly as the proceedings have in one or two cases come to our knowledge at a late stage. A certain amount of clothing has been exported through us during the past week for the use of those Russian troops who are actually fighting in Trans-Caspia as our Allies. This has been arranged amicably with the Director of Customs. 14. Persian and German intrigues.—We have been informd by the Governor- General of a recrudescence of Jangali activity which is supposed to have taken place. It is said that they have again invaded Resht, and possessed themselves of the contents of the Revenue office. I have told him that our troops returning from Baku will doubtless deal with this. P returning 15. The news of the fall of Baku has not aroused much interest in Persian circles, but our Russian friends either are, or pretend to be, very much perturbed at what they consider to be a strong likelihood of a Turkish occupation of Meshed within a few weeks. The advance of the Turks from Tabriz is also not regarded locally as of any very great importance : it is generally believed that the Turkish reinforced^ en0UgP t0 COme 80 far as a nd that it will not be largely !6 The Governor of Sarakhs informs us and the Governor-General of the arrival there of nine Turkish refugees who wish to go to Tehran as soon as possible The Governor asks for instructions. He has been told that the refugees who are undoubtedly escaped prisoners, should be sent into Meshed for internment. 17 In this week’s democrat meeting the news we had published regarding Turkish excesses m Azarbaqan was discussed. Some of those present refused to believe it . others said that if the report was correct the democrats ill-used were traitors to the cause The intentions of the Turks were then referred to and it was explained that they were now about to send troops with Mullas and papers to Turkestan and thence to Bokhara where they would be ioined bv Bolsheviks and other German adherents and would then divide their forces into two armies, one of which would proceed to India md Sistan and the other md Afghanistan. Any objection raised by the Amir of Afghanistan would be over come either by the j/cAad proclamation or by the pressure of his subjects. 18. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.

News from Herat.—The Naib-ul-Hukumah has armnint^ en n of Ears, as Governor of Sabsawar with orders to proceed at once to Ls ne/llrge!21. Abdullah Khan, the Meshed Agent, wrote to the Naib-ul-Hukumah on behalf of some Khafis to recover from a debtor named Mir Ali Jan, who had fled to Herat recently the sum of 6,000 tumans. The Naib enquired from Mir Ali, who replied that the case was false, got up against him by the Governor of Khaf, who is his enemy. 22. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has refused permission to certain Hazaras to go to”Meshed for pilgrimage on the ground that he is not sure that they intend to return to Herat. 23. Owing to the prevalent sickness (probably influenza) the Naib-ul-Hukumah was unable to hold the usual durbar on the 12th instant. 24. On the 7th instant a deputation of the Russians, with their German com panion, came to the Naib-ul-Hukumah from Bagh-i-Shiwan and requested him to allow some or all of them to remain at Herat. They received a cold reply how ever ; the Naib remarking that Herat being so near the frontier was not a good place for them. 6 25. On the 8th a further deputation asked that the whole party be permitted to proceed to Kabul together, but were informed that the arrangements made could not be altered. 26. On the same day an arrival from the frontier named Saiyid Aishan brought a letter for Kazim Beg, and was received by him with satisfaction and respect (It is not known who this may be.) 27. On the 9th von Gruden stated that the Russians had become two parties ■ one po-German and the other y&gt;ro-British. 28. On the 10th instant a further party of five Russian men with two women and three children arrived at Shiwan from the frontier. Five German rifles, six swords, and four revolvers which had been taken from them on the frontier have been placed in the Government store. 29. Attempts have been made apparently to persuade the Naib-ul-Hukumah that the sickness at Herat above alluded to was the result of the use of poisonous gas m the present war. Detailing the havoc that had been caused among the British troops by this innovation von Gruden is said to have explained that the Germans were obliged to introduce it in order to compel their enemies to cease fighting which they would not do although they were well aware that they would ultimately be defeated. J 30. News from Turkestan and Tnms-Cuspm.—Further attacks by the enemy upon our positions at Kahka are reported, but the particulars have not yet been received. They were no more successful than those which preceded them. It is said that further peace proposals by Bolsheviks have been rejected. W. G. GIEY, Lieut.-Colonel, &lt; His gritannic Majesty s Comul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. Meshed ; The 21st September, 1918. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C498FD—22-10-18—30—U.N.B.CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 40, for the week ending the 5th October 1. Persian officials. —I learn that the Mussadik-i-Divan, who has just been or is being relieved by the Rukn-ul-Wizarah (paragraph 3 last week) as Karguzar of Darajaiz, is to be appointed Deputy Governor of Astarabad. In view of his atti tude while at Darajaiz I have asked His Majesty’s Minister to prevent this appoint ment if possible. 2. Iktidar-ul-Mulk, the new Governor of Kalat, has left Meshed to take up his post. Mirza Ahmed Khan, Rais-i-Ma’arif, is appointed Rais-i-Tazkirah in place of the Rukn-ul-Wizarah mentioned above. Sultan-ul-Ulema succeeds him as Rais-i-Ma’arif. 3. The Governor General has appointed his nephew to the Governorship of Kuchan. This boy, who is only 18 years of age, is not to be actively employed at present: the Amid-ul-Mumalik, a trusted follower of the Kawwam., is coming from Tehran to conduct the work for the time being. 4. Persian affairs (heal). —The health of the city has much improved : influenza having disappeared and the other complaints recently spoken of in these Diaries being no longer heard of. The harvest has been good, as was expected, and there is no fear of famine this year. 5. The news of the recent British and Allied successes on the various battle- fronts have had great effect in the town ; having been promptly circulated by means of- the daily communiques mentioned in paragraph 16 last week. The number of our filends is rapidly increasing in consequence of the change in the military situation, and there is now less anxiety in connection with the presence of Turkish forces in Western Persia. 6. Persian affairs (general). —The province is quiet: no reports of raids or other disturbances having reached us during the week. 7. Russian affairs.- —The case of Nasir Begov (paragraph 12 last week) has been thoroughly enquired into, and the man himself examined at length. It seems that he addressed a meeting convened in the interests of Muslim unity on one occasion, and he has probably identified himself rather too prominently with the movement in this direction, which attained some prominence when inaugurated about a year ago. He has also spoken on at least one occasion contemptuously of the British, but on the other hand there have been no reports against him for nearly two months preceding the date of his arrest and several persons of importance in the city are ready to give security for his conduct in the future. I have decided, in view of these facts and the change in the military situation, to ask the Govern ment of India and His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran to allow his release. 8. A movement to form an irregular corps of Russian ez-officers, etc., in the Darajaiz district has bosn abandoned in view of Persian susceptibilities. This corps may subsequently be formed in Askabad or some other place across the border: it was apparently to assist the present Askabad Government in its struggle with the Bolsheviks. 9. A party of engineers with British officers and native labour have gone out to undertake the repair of certain portions of the Meshed-Askabad road in the interests of possible future military movements. The charge of this road was some years ago made over by the Khorassan Government of the time to the Rais-ut- Tujjar of Meshed, and more recently theRussian Banque d’Escompte tried to take over the management from him, without success. 10 Persian and German intrigues. —A party of nine Turkish escaped prisoners arrived at Meshed from Sarakhs on the 30th ultimo. They had be n sent from Bokhara by the Amir with a guide, and were passed on by the Governor of Sarakhs by order of the Governor General. They have been interne I with theother enemy prisoners in the Ark. In addition to this party an Austrian was arrested by our men near the Customs Office on the night of the 2 nd instant. This man will also be similarly interned. * 11 . Three’suspected persons have been sent in from Darajaiz by the Governor there, two of whom are Caucasian Turks and the third a Persian. Their cases are under investigation : one of them is the father-in-law of Piza Khan, the late Governor of Garajaiz. 12 . The local democrats have been unusually quiet during the week : they are reported to have held no meetings. This may be in consequence of our victories : in which case it is only what might be expected. 13. M. Sjoeberg, the Commissioner of Police, has published a proclamation dealing with the carrying of arms by the public in which the limitations and other rules are clearly set forth in a very satisfactory manner. There have recently been some raids upon houses in which arms were supposed to have been concealed, and the police department is showing praiseworthy activity in this important matter. 14. News Jran Turbat-i-Haidari. —An unfortunate complication is reported from this District. It appears that the contractor for the General Officer Command ing, East Persian Cordon, had purchased grain from Haji Amin of Turbat, who holds certain lands on lease which are the property of a friend of ours now in Tehran, Sirdar Muazzam. The grain in question is the produce of these lands, and it seems doubtful from representations made by the Sirdar whether the Haji had the right to dispose of the produce without reference to him. However this may be, all the purchase money has been paid in advance and the Revenue Department now has stepped in demurring to the delivery of the grain owing to this years revenue on the produce not having been paid by the lease- ' holder, whom they have arrested. We have secured his release on security, and the delivery of all the grain purchased has been ordered ; but it would appear to be safer in these cases not to pay the whole price in advance. 15. News from Turbot-i-Shaikh Jam. —Mirza Ismail, formerly Russian inter preter at Turbat-i-Jam, is appointed local passport officer at Karaiz, and has pro ceeded to take up his duties. 16. News from Karaiz. —Major Lang left for Khaf via Karat on the 26th (paragraph 18 last week), and Mr. Gould, who appears to have been delayed by indisposition, on the 27th. These officers were well received by Shuja-ul-Mulk, who promised to supply sowars for the Sistan Levy Corps as soon as the festivities in connection with the marriages of his sons were concluded. We have arranged to take on lease a caravanserai for the accommodation of the levy detachment about to be stationed at Karaiz. 17. News from Herat. —The death is reported of Muhammad Hussain Khan, * Achakzai, the late Governor of Killa Nau ; and the Naib-ul-Hukumah has dis missed several suits that were pending against him. 18. Severe fever—probably influenza—is reported to have broken out at Maimana, and also at Kandahar. 19. On the 21st ultimo the Naib-ul-Hakumah, while outside the city on a shooting excursion, saw a party of eight Russians coming in and ordered them to be conducted to the city. They have been taken to their fellow countrymen at Shiwan. One of the Russian engineers with his wife left Herat for Kabul on the same day, suitably attended and escorted. 20. Faiz-ullah and Ghulam Rasul, von Gruden’s messengers to Persia, returned to Herat on the 22nd ultimo. They say that they made their way to Tehran without detection, delivered their letter to the German Legation, and brought a reply. * v 21. The bitterness of'feeling existing between the Austrians and Kazim Beg has not abated. On the 23rd von Gruden having collected the Russians at Bagh-i- Shiwan informed them that the recent risings of frontier Turkomans against themi t G. M. Pre39, Simla.—‘No, C.526 F.D.—‘6*11-18—30—*B.C.R. bis are hi 'een and er. ted nd- )lds m, 1 it bad and rain were due to the intrigues of Kazim. He then induced all the men present to sign a paper testifying to the truth of this accusation, which it is said he intends to send to Kabul. * 22 . It seems that some of the Russian refugees are acquainted with the “ Bulgarian ” Mulla who recently came to Herat. Some of them met him in the bazar on the 23rd ultimo and wished to shake hands with him, etc., but he ingored their advances, preferring not to be recognised. As supposed this man is evidently an enemy preacher. 23. The Russian refugees have made a model of a bridge and have recommended it as a design for the newly contemplated Malan bridge. The Naib-ul-HuJcumah has ordered that it be sent to Kabul for the approval of His Majesty the Amir. 24. Kazim Beg and Nasr-ullah have spread false information during the week under report as usual. The items include a declaration of war by Persia against England : huge successes by the Turks in the Caucasus and Western Persia: and the death of the King of the Hedjaz and the return of the Arabs to Turkish alle giance. 26. It is now reported that the Russian refugees iu Herat declare themselves to be Bolsheviks. There seems to be some doubt here. Meshed : The 5th October 1918, W. G.

Two macliine guns had previously been despatched to Muhammadabad to take the place of 2 machine guns, which, with Lieutenant Gipps and maxim detachment, had been placed at the disposal of the Transcaspian authorities for employment at Bairam Ali. The latter guns were in action on the 14th instant against the Bolshevik force attacking Bairam Ali and 1 gnn is reported out of action. Accordingto the report furnished by the Transcaspian authorities their good work averted a disaster. Captain Smton, V.C., accompanies the 19th Punjabis. Lieutenant Antelme, R.A.S., left for India on the 14th instant. Lieutenant Smiiherman with wireless party and 2 military telegraphists reached Meshed on the 16th instant. 288. Reports from province. — Darag&gt;z quiet. As far as can be judged the unfriendly demeanour of some of the chief men is undergoing a change for the better, they expected trouble and looting from the In i in troops and are agreeably surprised at their good behaviour. Astrobad .—According to a delayed let'em dated 31st July, the late Governor has been killed and 400 gendarmes had arrived to maintain security. Turko mans in the neighbourhood very troublesome. Secret purchase of grain reputed to be for Germans or Turks has been reported. (Some difficu ty has been experienced lately in obtaining news from Askabad. One agen% as reported, wa s ejected, a second was stricken with typhus, and a third has just been killed by Turkoman a few miles from the town itself.) Shahrud and Sabzwar. —Nothing urgent reported. Some murders, includ ing that of one of the principal men of the former, are noted. 2£WA/m.—Secret opposition to the purchase of grain by the British, in this case said to emanate from the Governor, is reported. Z«&gt;?#ar.—Captain Preston, S. P. R., having purchased 10 horses at Mahmudabad had left for Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. The order reputed to give the sanction of the Governor-General to Sayyid Haidar’s headship of the Barbaris was received on the 7th instant and shewn to the Governor Jalabas-Sultan. Sayyid Haidar is said to have cancelled his nomination of GhulamShahas head of the Barbaris in Pain Jam, tlie reason alleged being pro-British proclivities of the latter. About 95 rifles, the majority being 10 and 5 shot magazine rifles, are reported at Abdullabad, Samarqavah, Amghun and Kalah-i-Nau villages of Pain Jam. Herat and Afghanistan. 289. Germans and adherents. —K azim Beg reached Chihil Hukhtaran on the 3rd instant. He had 3 servants with him and was escorted by 30 Afghan savars. A meeting was arranged for him by Rissaldar Yar Muhammad Khan with two persons awaiting him who had come from Russian territory, passing by the names of Gul Muhammad and Muhammad Din. The conversation was carried on in Turkish. Kazim Beg was expected to leave for Kara Tapa on the following day, and apparently both Yar Muhammad Khan and Major Khuda Baksh Khan have been placed at his disposition. The former had obtained aeaping machine from a Russian. He sent the Russian back to the Russian border and concealed the machine from Kazim. 290. Kushk frontier .—About 26 Russians, including women and children are reported at Kara Tapa, concerning whose disposal no orders have yet been received from Herat. The Russian Commissary from Kushk has been in perso nal communication with Yar Muhammad Khan on this and other matters. According to latest reports German influence is entirely predominant among the Bolshevik garrison of Kushk, the majority of which consists of ex-prisoners of war. There are now 2 Russians with their wives at Herat. A large quantity of hay has been stored in the Afghan frontier region and grass continues to be cut for that purpose. The residents of Baighist are apprehensive of war. 291. Military affairs .—One company of the 3rd Herat! battalion left for Charsaddah on the 6 th instant in relief. Hasht-yak recruits found medically unfit were called upon to find substi tutes. Several of those produced having deserted, sureties have been exacted for the future. Russian Tubkestan. 292. Current affav s.- Matters are going extremely badly for the temporary Transcaspian authorities (Mensheviks), and thev have already evacuated Merv before the advancing Bolsheviks. They are handicapped by their weakness in artillery, but still more so by the want of discipline and warlike spirit which prevails particularly among the Russian units of the force. The Turkoman levies are for the most part raw and untrained in modern warfare, and the task confronting the Turkoman and Russian commanders, who appear to be capable, is a most difficult one in the light of the heterogeneous and ill-equipped material of which they are compelled to make the best. 1 hey were driven cn the 14th instant from their position at Bairam Ali which consisted of a single line of sufficiently well made trench athwart the railway line, and fell back on Merv, which has in its turn been abandoned with the idea of a stand at Tejen The Bolshevikforce, consisting of 1,000 to .1,500 prisoners of war and as many adherents, is practically tied to the railway for all present operations. They have at least 9 Q. F. field-guns and a large number of machine guns With the evacuation of Merv the declaration of Kushk for the Bolsheviks is a practi cal certainty. No recent news of Dutov is available. Meshed ; 17th August 1918. L E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.•Colonel, O. S. O.-l. -v - - .f . ■.&gt;&gt;-. —- ,. ~ ^ . ‘ , r&lt; gfl fe-V ..

Khorasan and North-East Persia. 293 British force .—Headquarters and 2 companies 19th Punjabis reached Kachan on the 21st instant en route for Muhammadabad. One Company, 19th Punjabis, under command of Captain Drummond has arrived at Meshed from Turbat-i-Haidari. Lieutenant Ward returned to Meshed from Baku on the 18th instant leaving the same evening for Muhammadabad. On the retreat of the Menshevik forces from Merv Lieutenant Gipps and machine-gun detachment returned to Muhammadabad to refit, the whole of the personnel suffering from malaria. The casualties sustained by the party in the engagement at Bairam Ali were two men wounded. Later accounts confirm the excellent behaviour of this small party in the face of a universal panic, and the fact that their stubborn resistance averted a general rout and stopped the Bolshevik pursuit. Seven attacks are reported to have been made on them by the Hun garian prisoners, serving with the Bolsheviks, and the machine-guns were estimated to have caused between 200 and 300 casualties to the enemy. On r&lt; treating a stand was made on 3 occasions. Finally one gun, having become overheated Avas dismantled and abandoned after several men had bem badly burnt in attempting to carry it away. The infantry company of the Muhammadabad detachment under Captain Shu‘e with Major Bingham as liaison officer, entrained at Artik on the 20th instant to join the Transcaspian force. 294 Bepnrts from province .—Except from Astrabad, tvhere considerable insecurity of life and property reigns, reports contain little of interest. Recent events in Turkistan have evidently militated against the departure of enemy prisoners as nothing hasbem heard of their passage through Persia from any centre. Khaddu in the Kuchan region, and Azizullah Khan Turshizi have been giving trouble, and a Persian force of 300 men with three guns left Meshed during the week to operate against the former, and 400 men with 3 guns have started for Turbat-i-Haidari for action against the latter. 295. Enemy agents .—9 e r emy agents, arrested by the Trancaspian autho rities, have been taken over by our troops at Muhammadabad, and are on their way to Meshed. Lieutenant IJprsyth with a cavalry escort to take them over from the frontier detachment reached Kuchan yesterday. On information from . the Transcaspian authorities that the Austrian dentist at Meshed Rohrlich, and his Russian wife had been in constant communication with the above agents, these two persons were arrested and are detained at H. B. M. Consulate-General pending investigation. 296. Deserter .—A Patban deserter from a Labour Corps in Mesopotamia was arrested at Sharifabad, and is in military custody here. 297. Germans and Apparently the N&amp;ib-ul-Hukumah has decided that the presence of Kazim Beg near the Russian frontier is not desirable, and he intends to recall him to Herat. Kazim Beg is credited with the intention of having desired to cross the frontier, but he refrained on hearing a report that arrest would await him on the Russian side. It is unlikely, however, that the Transcaspian authorities with so much on their hands have been able to take any measures against him or any of the several other Turkish agents whom we have indicated to them. Major Dawkes, Political Department, reached Meshed on the 17th instant. Herat and Afghanistan. - ?g-, me intercourse his tahen place between von Gruden, and the two Russian engineers at, Herat. The latter were anxious to share the accom modation at the Bagh-i-Kartah, but wore discouraged by vou Gruden. These engineers were invited to inspect the Pul-i-Malan, hut stated their unwillingness to undertake its repair. 298. Military Affairs.—A. company of the Jadidi Herati Battalion has proceeded to Ghurian in relief. Gymnastic training is to be introduced in the Herat garrison. In consequence of the receipt on the 14th instant of a letter from Bissaldar Yar Muhammad from tlie Northern frontier the Naib-ul-Hukumah. sum moned the Naib-Salar to a secret consultation, and as a result the Colonel of the Artillery with 40 of his men, and 4o infantry started for Chihildukh- taran. 20 pack animals were taken, 2 of which carried Martini rifles, and 5 ammunition. Up to the time of despatch of the report no explanation of this move was forthcoming, the carrying of the spare rifles in particular causing speculation. Information was received at Herat on the 13th instant that British troops were at Dushakh. Eussian Tcrkistan. 300. Current events .—retreat of the Transcaspian force was con tinued from Merv to Tejen, where a stand was proposed. The position was bombarded by the Bolsheviks on the 19th instant, and they subsequently attacked but were repulsed. In spite of this Tejen was evacuated for Dushakh on the following day, the Tejen bridge having been damaged but not destroyed. (The railwaymen, regarding the line as their means of livelihood, are exceedingly averse to causing any capital damage to it, no matter that the consequences to their party may be. This spirit, coupled with indiscipline and mutual distrust between the component elements Russians, Turkoman, and Armenians— is at the root of much of the want of success of the present venture). No more was seen of the enemy with the exception of a few mounted men near Tejen, hut a further retirement was made to Kahka, somewhat to the east of which a position has been in course of preparation. The position has been somewhat improved by the receipt on the 20th instant of two guns from Baku, and the despatch of the British foree Dom Muhammadabad is reported to have caused much enthusiasm at Askhabad and an improvement of the moral at the front. The prospect of further help from Baku has also had an encouraging effect. Lieutenant-Colonel Battine accompanied the guns, subsequently returning to Krasnovodsk. Prom wireless messages received it is apparent that so far the Bolshevik force has not obtained touch with their comrades at Kushk, against which place a Menshevik detachment has been operating with no great success. The Turkoman element, judging from reports of their crossing the Persian frontier near Sarakhs, is apparently discouraged, and the degree of help to be expected from them in the future appears doubtful. The serious consequences of a Bolshevik success, tvhich would probably result in a massacre of tUe “ bourgeoisie or at any rate of the officer class,, are realised. The result of this has unfortunately not been to strengthen the combination of threatened elements, but to cause a migration, both of Russians and Persians, across the Persian frontier. Some small success, coupled with more or less substantial help from outside, would in all probability restore the position. Letter from correspondents, dated about a week back point to strenuous efforts among Turkish propagandists to sow discord among the races composing the Menshevik forces. This activity has been communicated both by Musulman and Armenian correspondents, and there is little doubt that a measure of success has been obtained. Meshed; *\ E, A. P. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel, 24th August 1918. ) G.S.O. 1- Sl 58 yGSB —45 — 3 - 10 - 18 —GCPSIntelligence Summary for the fortnight ending the 7th September 1918, No. 35. Khorasan and North East Persia. 301. British force .—Since last recorded the sequence of events on the Transcaspian front has been as follows. On the 26th August, Headquarters 19th Punjabis with 2 companies entrained at Artik for Kahka. On that day the enemy carried out an inconclusive attack on the Kahka position—apparently with the idea of a reconnaissance in force. Early on the 28th August he attacked again, and by making a wide detour round the left flank, succeeded in reaching the pro ximity of Kahka Railway station in rear of the actual battle position. A force of Turkomans who had been posted in Kahka old fort in rear of the left flank in view of such a contingency, retired at once on the enemy’s approach leaving the way open to him. The station was saved by the reserve company and details of 19th Punjabis, together with a motley force of Russians and Turkoman, and the enemy driven through the enclosed gardens of Kahka to the open country where he at first took refuge in the old fort, subsequently retiring in confusion with the loss of 5 machine guns and a cart-load of rifles. An attack at the same time on the main position was not pressed. During this action his artillery fire was continuous but practically innocuous. Owing to the blind nature of the fighting, and the probability that some of our losses were caused by our ill- disciplined allies, 4 men of the Punjabis were killed and 17 wounded. Major Bingham, Captain Teague-.)ones, Lieutenant Stewart of the 19th Punjabis, and Lieutenant Ward of the 60th Rifles were wounded—the last-named mortallv. He succumbed to his wound at Askhabad on 30th ultimo, and was buried there with full military honours, the funeral being attended by a large concourse of people. During the fight the Bolsheviks attempted in their usual manner to call a truce. No action of importance occurred on succeeding days, fighting being limited to an exchange of artillery desultory fire. The Bolsheviks eventually retired to Dushakh, abandoning some transport at Arman, sagad. at which place according .to native information, 37 bodies were buried- Their armoured train is recently reported to have once more approached Arman- sagad : and to be accompanied by troop trains. On the 30th August the British force was reinforced by a company of British infantry from Krasnovodsk, and on the 5th instant by a section of British Field Artillery thence. 302. Enemy Agents .—The following persons arrested at Askhabad by the Transcaspian authorities as enemy agents have been brought to Meshed under escort. Roger Stump (Swiss), Metchislav Schmidt (Pole) Otto Simons (Ger man), Franz Kostor (German), Julius Wagner (German), Tor Morien (Swede), Yuri Kovenko (Russian),'Vladislav Smootni (Austrian f Pole), Max Kleinki (Ger man). Their papers contained a quantity of propogandist.literature. On infor mation from Askhabad that the Austrian dentist Rohrljch and his wife were m communication with these people their arrest was carried out. A young German, Wilhelm Becker, stating that he is a deserter from the 5th Saxon Regiment, has been detained in custody here. Astrabad —The nomination of the Sardar of Bujnurd as Governor of •tstrabad having fallen through, and no appointment made, the town and neigh- Dourhood appear to be in considerable disorder. Turkoman, are looting freely m ■ he actual vicinity of the town, and great insecurity to life and property are report- sd. Gendarmerie have left Astrabad for Shahrud where some have arrived. Herat and Afghanistan. . Germans and adherents.— Kmm Beg returned to Herat. His trip 3°4 appears to have been disappointing. i ' *' ..1 ill iWm SEcanwm Im. ; ?■ ^ 78 18 OCT 1913 £3 H0V'?313 ifi ■ k % 305 Refugees .—Some 40 Russian refugees are reported to have reached Herat. Many of these seem to be craftsmen, and so far the step appears to be the sequel to the reported invitation of skilled Russian workmen to Afghanis tan. There is a good deal of communication between the Afghan frontier autho rities and Kushk, and it is freely rumoured that this is in connection with an inten tion of ceding the fortress, or at any rate part of its military stores to the Afghans. Having regard to the Teutonic composition of the present Kushk garrison such a step in return fora quid pro quo \s not impossible, but no confirmation has been received from reliable sources, 306. Military .—180 remounts were brought from the Chakcharan district. The Naib Salar decided that they were not up to the stamp of artillery horses and detailed them for transport. On return from Farah, the escort to the ammunition brought 16 kharwars of saltpetre and 50 kharwars of wheat to Herat. They reported the garrison of Farah at 2 infantry battalions (1 newly raised and not yet armed), 10 M. L. field and mountain guns, and 2 maxims. They state that the drill and discipline of these troops is far inferior to that of the Herat garrison. 307. Anti-export measures .—A secret conference was recently held by the Naib-ul-Hukumah and the Naib Salar. Its purport is supposed to be the issuing of strict orders to frontier officials to forbid the export of wheat, rice and ghi, and to despatch these commodities to Herat. In addition Afghan owners of transport animals on the frontier are to be required to bring them 3 farsakhs within the Afghan border, and those hiring out transport animals to Meshed to give a security that the animals will be returned within 40 days under pain of forfeiture. Russian Turkistan. 308. Current events .— The condition of affairs in Transcaspia is, apart from actual events at the front, far from satisfactory. The present provisional Govern ment enjoys little authority, and under present circumstances is afraid to assert itself. The Turkoman question is a difficult one and any success of the Turks on the Baku side may be expected to render it still more difficult. There is reason to suspect want of good faith—to put it mildly—among their leaders, while certain elements among them are known to be pro-Turk in their sympathies. Their fighting value in the present combat is, as has been seen, far from great; and many of them have left the scene of hostilities while their families are flock ing to Sarakhs and other frontier points in fear of Bolshevik revenge. They have also made overtures for refuge on the North Afghan frontier. According to reports received by the Transcaspian staff Aziz Khan’s Tejen Turkomans have operated successfully against the enemy on the railwav, but this success requires confirmation. Among the Menshevik Russian ranks there also exists a disposi tion to come to terms with the enemy. It is fairly certain that some deserted on the 28th August, and it was apparently these individuals who recently appeared on an engine with a white flag proposing peace. On this occasion they were fired on. The supply question is also a serious one, deprived as the Mensheviks are at present of the fertile Merv and Tejen cases. Their present intention to receive wounded and refugees from Baku will render this difficulty still greater. Meshed ; ?th September 1918 .} E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.-Colt G.

British force .—During the week enemy trains were located east of Armansagad and some renewal of his activity was expected. A force of all arms, accompained by an armoured train, all liberally provided with white flags marched towards our position, when they sighted a strong patrol of our force with which was a section of British Field Artillery. In spite of their wh'te flags the enemy opened tire which was returned by our guns who were reported to have made a direct hit on one of the enemy guns. He then retired. On the Ilth instant he again attacked the Kahka position, making four attempts in all but was easily beaten off by artillery fire. Our forces subsequently brought in 3 guns and some wheeled transport abandoned by him and reported having found 8 bodies. Since then matters have been quiet on the Kahka front. Total Transcaspian casualties 3 wounded. There is some improvement in the malaria and influenza from which onr troops have been suffering. One squadron 28th Light Cavalry reached Meshed yesterday from Turbat- i-Haidari under command of Major Kreyer. 310. Enemy agents, etc .—A party of 60 to 70 Austrian prisoners of war including certain enemy agents arrested at Askabad, are on their way to Meshed from Askabad en route for India, under an escort of the 28th Light Cavalry. 311. Provinces —Turkoman remain very troublesome around Astrabad and looting of caravans and animals continues. Sha^rud reports that since the Jangalis defeat there is practically no further mention of them in local circles. The operations againt Azizullah Khan Turshizi (in which all the Persian troops who recently left Meshed were eventually emnloyed) occupy attention at Shabzwar and Nishapur. Azizullah abandoned his position, and the affair seems likely to be liquidated in the usual Persian manner. Azizullah will probably be freely bled. No fighting appears to have occurred. Reports have been received recently of the export of grain from the Yomud country North of Bnjnurd both through Transcaspia and to the South- East angle of the Caspian Tnese supplies are apparentlv destined for the Turks. According to information received by the Provincial Director of Customs arms are received in return. The matter is being investigated. Herat and Afghanistan. 312. Germans and adherents.—During; his stay near the Russian frontier Kazim Beg is reported to have undertaken some propaganda among Turkoman. Both he and von Gruden have been in communication with the Russian refugees at Bagh-i-Shirwan. Von Gruden is reported to have stated that these refugees include 4 Germans and an Indian. Some of the principal of the Russian refugees are to be sent to Kabul and preparations for their journey are in progress. Another party of refugees are reported to have reached the frontier. 313. Military affairs. —Interest is apparently centred on the Russo- Afghan frontier, concerning which many rumours are current. The Artillery Colonel with the detachment he took from Herat is at Chihil Dukhtaran, but it is not yet clear what he is actually doing. 100 khavanin have been ordered to proceed to Moghor post. On the 5th instant the Naib Salar himself left Herat accompanied by some senior officers, ostensibly for the shrine of Sultan Sheikh Irah, some 20 miles from Herat, but he is credited with the intention of visiting the Ghurian frontier. r-' _ J HDTA F r ,inQN SEnir** ‘ f | lav .UVu 78 18 OOT im i OC) r-'-' w i »’.v v vw *Apparently the wrong kind of ammunition was despatched to Farah and orders have been sent to return about 100 boxes and to replace it from Ht rat. The export of iron and particularly horse-shoes from Herat to Kandahar has been forbidden. Bttssian Turkistan. 314. Currents event .—Apart from their military operations on the Kahka tront recorded above, the Bolsheviks are wreaking vengeance where they can on the Turkoman of Tejen and Merv, and many innocent persons, including Persians, are reported to have been killed. The principal buildings of Tejen itself have been destroyed and it is probable that the same procedure is being followed at Merv. They are stated to have summer ed tho Turkoman to Tejen for a conference, and the Sarakhs Turkoman are in doubt whether to obey the summons. They have been threatened by a visitation with armoured cars in case of non-compliance. Turkish propaganda continues to be reported among the Yomud and Tekke Turkoman. The garrison of Kushk is still held up by Menshevik partisans operating from Tashkepri. , f ; . - # The Bolsheviks have ordered a general mobilisation at Tashkent against the forces of counter-revolution. Their communiques are conspicuous for want of truth, but they have at last acknowledged that they are opposed by British troops and not by Czecho-Slovaks at Kahka. No mention is made by them of the pressure by the latter irom Semirechia. Bokhara is apparently still neutral, but no reliable news thence has come through. Meshed ; 14th September 1918. E. A F.

British force—\\ squadrons 28th Cavalry, to be joined later by 1 squadron, under Major Kreyer, and a detachment of Barbari levies under .Lieutenant Oaslmg have left for Kahka via Askhabad. At Kahka itself a collection of enemy trains was noted on the 16th instant near Armansagad, and on the 18th instant he again attacked our position fight ing continuing throughout the day. He was reported to have fourteen euns in action and to have fired some 1,500 shell. In addition to his main attack a mounted detachment made a wide detour to the north and reached the railway near Kaushut, the intermediate station between Kahka and Artik. They caused an interruption to the railway and telegraph line, but apparently were accounted for and the damage was repaired. The main attack was successfully beaten off and the enemy retired towards evening being pursued by - our troops who captured some abandoned transport, rifles, and machine-gun ammunition They report having buried 20 bodies. On the Transcaspian side 3 men were killed and a few wounded. 1 British officer and 1 B. O. R were slightly wounded The enemv’s artillery fire was practically innocuous, a large propor tion of shells failing to explode. 316. Enemy agents.—W prisoners, mostly Austrian prisoners of war, but including several enemy agents and suspects of other nationalities, have reached Meshed from Askhabad and preliminary examination is being carried out. &lt;« n ^ 'Ovinces.—IAt tle of interest is reported. An unconfirmed report of a German having left Astrabad for Kuchan-route not stated-has been received. A deserter from the Mesopotamian Labour Corps has been arrested and brought in from Sharifabad. Herat and Afghanistan. 318. Germans and adherents .—Kazim Beg is reported to have received a letter from Turkistan brought by a Turkoman. Both he and Barakatullah were said to be depressed in spirits. Kazim Beg has since fallen ill of influenza together with some of his followers. 319. Refugees .—Preparations for the despatch of the Russians to Kabul continue. A few more have reached Herat. The representatives of the Trans caspian Government at Meshed have no knowledge of the identity of these persons. It will be remembered that some months ago a persistent rumour was circulated that the English were about to construct a railway from Herat to Kushk and apparently these persons considered such employment preferable to the difficulties of life in Russia. 320. Military affairs.—Thu Artillery Colonel with his detachment returned to Herat on the 7th instant from Chihil Dukhtaran, where the whole party had been suffering severely from fever, and one man had died. The Naib Salar’s tour was of short duration as, remaking in signalling communication with Herat, he ascertained that practically the whole garrison had been prostrated with influenza, and returned to the city where he imme* diately fell ill. Parades were impossible and it was even d fficult to find men for guard duty, but so far fatal cases do not seem to have occiurred. 321.

The news of the fall of Baku produced considerable alarm at Askhahad hut this appears by this time to be to some extent allayed. A steamer contain ing among a number of Bolsheviks the notorious leaders Shaumian and Petrov from Baku arrived at Krasnovodsk where the Bolsheviks were disarmed and imprisoned. Machine-guns and a fair proportion of rifles were taken from them. An aeroplane with 2 Russian aviators also reached Krasnovodsk from Baku, and will be employed on the Kahka front. Owing to the mistake of a telegraphist some 200 Russian wounded who reached Krasnovodsk from Baku were reported to be British. Russian Turkistan. Meshed ; E. A. E.

After our first interview, however, he sent me word that he would not give Asad-ud-Dauleh more than 2,000 At the close of my second interview I informed Hisam that if he would not settle with me in full, I had the permission of His Majesty’s minister to seize the equivalent of the two claims in grain, from his villages.

Persian officials. —The Governor-General has been out of town during the week ; having taken his family to the cooler atmosphere of a neighbouring hill station some 25 miles from Meshed. 2. The Ma’tamid-ul-Wizara (paragraph 2 last week) leaves for Darajaiz to morrow, and the Ashja’-ul-Mulk who has been posted as Governor of Kalat will proceed to take up his appointment on the arrival of Mirza Ahmad Ali Khan (paragraph 5 of Diary No. 31) who has been ordered to Meshed by telegram. 3. The question of M. Kornelis’ return to the Finance office is not yet settled, and other candidates for the post—notably the Najd-us-Saltanah—who occupied it before M. Kornelis—have entered the arena. I have again telegraphed urging the restitution of our friend wffio will be most useful in regard to the purchase of grain for the troops. 4. Persian affairs (local). —The Commandant of the Persian forces in garrison is taking out 450* men of all arms with a mountain gun and some muzzle loaders to Turbat-i-Haidari. I enquired from him regarding the purpose of the expedition, and w T as informed that the men were going out for manoeuvres. It is said, however, that posts are to be establised along the Sistan road. Through a misunderstanding a difficulty arose with the Commandant in regard to 50 camels the owner of which had accepted a contract with our troops and re ceived an advance of money from them after having been engaged by the Persian force. It w r as satisfactorily arranged by our retaining forty and ceding to the Commandant the remaining ten camels.- 5. As might be expected Meshed traders have petitioned the Governor-General in connection with the question of export of sugar and piece goods to Russia; urging that the enforcement of the prohibition (paragraph 8 last week) will throw a large portion of Khorassan trade into Afghanistan. This argument is strong, and the matter will have to be reconsidered, at least as regards goods which are not of military value. 6. A telegram w y as received by the local Government on the night of the 16th instant from Tehran directing the immediate election of members for the National Assembly. 7 . Persian affairs (general). —According to a report received from Captain Abd-us-Samad Shah the reception of our detachment of troops at Muhammadabad in the Darajaiz district w r as satisfactory notwithstanding the democratic tendencies of the present Governor. No animosity was displayed, but conjecture is rife as to developments and possibilities. 8. The new Government have decided to revoke the order placing the Astarabad province under the Chief of Bujnurd (paragraph 10 of Diary No. 31), and the ques tion of a Governor for Astarabad is under consideration at Tehran. Meanwhile the local Rais-i-Gendarmerie is administering the province. 9. It is reported from Tehran that Fath-us-Saltanah, an assistant in the Mar Office, has been murdered ; it is said by the Bakhtiaries in connection with a plot which they had made against the Shah, and which their victim was supposed to be about to reveal to His Majesty. The Terrorists in Tehran are being arrested freely according to local report here. 10 . The condition of the province of Nishapur is bad. Little is done there to check highway robbery, and nothing can be done here as the Governor is nominated by the Naiyir-ud-Daulah party and the provincial Government of Khorassan cannot interfere. 11. British affairs. —Numbers of local people now desire to go to Karb ila, ostensibly on pilgrimage but really I suspect to see how matters are there. I have i 4 \ LYJi* K..fNL 5 No 74 . ® \ 27 iW KW \ TIiobtained the consent of the authorities in Baghdad to issue sanction to 12 persons in all to make the trip, and passes to this amount are being issued.

At the same time they direct the procedure m the case already advised by me— viz., that the produce of the lands in dispute should be detained pending a settlement. 13. Some 50 Turis and Bangshis arrived at Meshed during the week on pil grimage. They came via Afghanistan, but will probably return by the Sistan route. « 14 . The remainder of the 19th Panjabis in garrison left on the 16th instant to reinforce the detachment already at Muhammadabad but another company is expected from Turbat-i-Haidari in a few days to replace them Two platoons ot levies under the command of Lieutenant Caslmg are also expected m M eshed shortly, having been directed to call here on the way from Kam to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam where they are to be stationed according to present arrangements. Sanction has been accorded by Government for the organisation of a Khorassan Levy Corps : to be composed in the first instance of 500 Hazara infantry. Recruit ing is proceeding satisfactorily. 15. My colleague has protested officially against the arrest by our troops of the two Russian subjects mentioned in paragraph 12 last week, notwithstanding that he had previously agreed to their arrest. This protest he explains as a purely formal affair, designed to save his face with all classes of his subjects. 16 Our dak sowar who had embezzled postal articles entrusted to him some months ago (paragraph 17 of Diary No. 31) has died somewhat suddenly m the Naz- miah prison in which he had been placed. The reason of death was said to have been an overdose of opium to which the man was kown to have been addicted. 17. Russian off airs .—“The order for the cessation of the manufacture of intoxicating liquors in Meshed city has been extended to those Armenian Russian subjects who were engaged therein. They have protested, and have asked for permission to sell their remaining stocks to avoid heavy loss. The question is under discussion. 18. Persian and German intrigues .—Certain democrat leaders have attempted again to place obstacles in the way of our purchase of grain, but we have succeeded in defeating their efforts and purchase is proceeding satisfactorily. Their object in this time was merely to make money : they dare not act from other motives openly under the present regime. Nevertheless I will make representations to the Kawwam on his return to the city next week. The editor of the “ Bahar ,, has once more published an offensive article regarding the British, and will meet with his deserts on the return of the Kawwam, according to our joint decision that he should receive no further chances. 19. Two democrat meetings were held this week. At the first the conversation dealt with the situation in Transcaspia and the prohibition to export certain articles of merchandise which is spoken of elsewhere. It was decided to make a strong representation to the Kawwam on the subject. It has been proposed that all sales of grain above certain prices should be stopped, and a reference to the Governor General on this point also was recommended and will be made in due course. Finally the company congratulated one another upon the success that had attended their efforts in regard to the elections for the local Municipality, and agreed that they should endeavour to be equally represented in the National Assembly (paragraph 4 last week). In the second meeting which was held in the house of one of the extremist party the main subject of discussion was again the purchase of grain by the British, and it was decided that if the Kawwam-us-Saltanah would not stop the extensives ■~-r 3 purchases that were being made some action should be taken by those present at the meeting. e 1 ♦ n .d iv d 20. A quarrel took place on the night of the 15th instant between two of the interned Turks in the Ark prison. One Usman, who is a Sunni, attacked Ali Musa, a Shia, with a dagger, and wounded him so severely that he is not expected to recover. The police have since taken away all the arms in possession of these men, and it is proposed to imprison three of them in the less favourable confinement of the Nazmiah. / # i|. 21 . News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —M. Maximoff, the Eussian Vice-Consul, ^ has left for Kazvin ; apparently he is succeeded by M. de Beauvais. This is reported to be a temporary arrangement only, but there is also the probability that it was desired to open a post for de Beauvais. M.

News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —The arrival of Captain Preston of the South Persia Kifles is reported (paragraph 14 of Diary No. 31). Orders have, however, been received from the Chief of the General Staff that he is to make no purchases of animals in the area occupied by the East Persia Cordon. He has referred to me a request that he may continue to purchase horses, and I have passed this on in view of the possibility that it is transport animals only that are to be included in the prohibition. Meanwhile Captain Preston remains at Jam. 24. Our Agent at Herat has sent his nephews and a sowar to Meshed ; the latter as escort to an Indian whom he has arrested for not giving a satisfactory account of himself. This man appears to be dumb ; he has marks of manacles on his legs. Enquiry is proceeding; the party arrived at Meshed this morning* (17th instant). 25. News from Karaiz. —Mirza Ismail Khan, the late Eussian Agent at Karaiz, has now joined the Excise Department and is appointed Excise Officer at Karaiz. 26. Neivs from Herat .— On a charge of having in their possession some documents in English ten men, with their families, have been deported to Herat from Kabul where thev have arrived. Their property appears to have been confiscated at Kabul, but they are to be granted Khalisah lands at Herat. 27. Anxiety prevails among Herat merchants who have recently sent merchandise to Eussian territory on account of the fresh disorders which are said to have broken out at Merv, Panjdeh, and Takhtah Bazar.

Eeferring to paragraph 26 last week it seems that Kazim Beg, Haji Ahmad, Puri Khan, and Asghar left the Bagh-i-Kartah at midnight, escorted by a jamadar and some sowars and provided with four government ponies for their baggage. They carried a firman from, the Naib-ul-Hukumah to the frontier officials directing that they should be assisted in crossing the frontier. It is rumoured, however, that the frontier officials stopped the party, advising them not to proceed as the British were on the lookout for them. The Bagh-i-Kartah establishment were very glad to see Kazim Beg go, as they had long complained of his abuse and harsh treatment. .nail? their thev 29.

D.—19-9-18—30—JLA, etc.CONFIDENTIAL y Meshed Diary No. 34, for the week ending the 24th August 1918. 1. Persian officials .the newly appointed Governor of Darajaiz, left on the 18th instant to take up his post. He asked that the Officer Commanding British troops at Muhammadabad might give him any assistance that might he required in case the outgoing incumbent refused to hand over charge. 2. ’Ashja’ul-Mulk is about to leave for Kalat. Mirza Ahmad Ali Khan, who has arrived in Meshed, (paragraph 2 last week) is to be posted as Governor of 3. His Excellency the Governor General has returned to the city. I find that both he and his brother, the Prime Minister, would prefer that M. Kornelis (paragraph 3 last week) should not return to the Revenue office. M. Kornelis has been offered a good post at Tehran, and will probably accept that. 4. Persian affairs (local).—The Sirdar Intisar, Commandant of the local Per sian forces, called on the 22nd instant to say good-bye, and to inform me of the ob ject of his trip. This is to punish Azizullah Khan of Turshiz, who refuses to sub mit to ordets directing him to make good certain losses sustained by local people in raids committed by himself and his men. (See paragraph 4 last week). 5. The Governor General has shewn me a proclamation which he proposes to issue on the subject of the ensuing elections for the National Assembly. Pie enquired whether I had any objection to its publication, and has not yet received a reply, as the matter is being referred to His Majesty’s Minister. 6. Under the orders of the Kawwam-us-Saltanah, the house of the Sirdar Muazziz, a late Rais-i-Kushun in Meshed, was searched for arms by the police during the week. Half-a-dozen rifles and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition were found, and confiscated, 7. Persian affairs (general) .—The condition of the province remains satis-, &gt; factory : and no further rumours of intrigues against the Kawwam have appeared. General approval of him as Governor General is expressed by all parties. '' g. British affairs.—An absurd report gained credence in Meshed during the week to the effect that our troops while on the way to Muhammadabad had been attacked and practically annihilated by the rober Khuddu and his gang in the vicinity of Kuchan. Stories of the large numbers of British wounded are in circulation, which probably have as their foundation the presence of one or two wounded men at Muhammadabad. 9 A dispute appears to have occurred at Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam m connection with the matter referred to in paragraph 12 last week. The special envoy sent down by the Kawwam seems to have sided with the representatives of the Naib- ut-Taulia, and to have decided not to carry out the orders of the Kawwam that the produce of the lands in question should be detained. Captain Preston, S. P. R., who has not yet left the neighbourhood accompanied by Jalal-us-Sultan, the Gov ernor of Jam, proceeded to the land, and there found that the^Naib’s people, m company with the envoy, were prepared to resist by force the interference of the Governor or anyone who intended to remove the produce of the land. Seeing a British officer they apparently thought better of this, and the Kawwam’s orders were carried out, but false reports were promptly sent to the latter, and he was very.indignant at what he considered to be the unwarranted interference of Captain Preston. Explanations have cleared the air ; and the fact that the Governor and Captain Preston were acting together, which was concealed m the first reports received, naturally changes the case against the latter. 10. Riza Khan, the outgoing Governor of Darajaiz, has telegraphed to the Kawwam informing him that certain persons at Darajaiz are helping the British, and asking what steps he should take against them. In view of the Governors Gunabad.rnammam h fn recall having already been ordered His Excellency does not intend to reply to this communication. 11. A secret telegram has been received by the Kawwam from the Karguzari of Darajaiz asking what the authorities should do in case the British asked them to carry out arrests-of Russian subjects for example. A reply has been sent direct ing that the British should be allowed to do what th£y considered necessary, but that the local authorities should leave all arrests to them. 12. The “ Bahar ” has been suppressed for the present in connection with the article mentioned in paragraph 18 last week. 13 The Allied Proclamation to the Russian people has been translated into Russian and Persian and distributed in the city and neighbourhood One recipient of a copy remarked that the British had issued similar proclamations elsewhere, but that they had nevertheless converted the supposed temporary occupation of the country into a permanent one in more than one case. 14. Major Daukes, Indian Political Department, arrived at Meshed on the 17th instant, and Lieutenant Casling with too platoons of the Sistan levy corps on the 24th. These levies are apparently to remain here for the present. It is hoped that their presence will stimulate recruiting. 15. Russwyi uffctiTS.- —M. Maximov, Russian Vice-Consul at Turbat i Haidari, has passed through Meshed en route for Kazvin. He visited me on the 22nd instant a t my request, and there does not appear to be truth in the suspicions that we had formed against him of pro-enemy or Bolshevik gleanings. He informed me that he wished to take part in the war against the Central Powers, either as an officer or, failing that, as a private soldier. 16. Persian and German intrigues .-—The police are watching five Caucasians End one Armenian who have recently come to the city dressed as Turks. Three of them have opened a shop in the Pain Khiaban quarter, and the others a coffee house near the quarters of the Persian Cossack Brigade. 17. In the democrat meetings this 'week the talk was almost entirely of the condition of the country and the political situation. It was pointed out again that there was a probability of a German invasion of Khorassan, and that this probability was entirely due to the presence of British troops in the province. It was represented that the British were now buying up half the grain in the province, and that the Germans would commandeer the remaining half on their arrival; what then should be done to save the country ? One speaker proposed that the British should be begged to save the country from complete ruin, and finally it was decided to refer the question as to what should be done to all ] rovincial democrat committees as well as to Tehran. 18. News from Karaiz .—The Governor General has no intention of dismissing Shuja-ul-Mulk, and the latter may shortly pay a visit to Meshed. This is satis factory as no change is advisable. 19. i Sharif News from Herat .—Cholera is reported to have appeared at Mazar-i- 20. The people mentioned in paragraph 26 (not 25) last week are now said to have been deported from Kabul as incorrigible and worthless, not on account of having English documents in their possession. 21. One Mir Ali Jan has arrived at Herat having been sent in by the Governor of Ghurian. This man is the uncle of the Persian outlaw Mir Yusuf who was recently put to death by the orders of the Governor General of Khorassan for # out- lawry and murder in the Khaf district. He is wanted by the Governor of Khaf for participation in his nephew’s misdeeds. 22. Von Gruden, with the two Russians mentioned in paragraph 30 (not 29) last week, visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 10th instant. The object of this visit was to arrange for an inspection by the Russian engineer officers of the Malun. 23 • ^ tlie some day the Naib-ul-Hukumat sent the late mihmandar of Bagh- i-Kart ah to Chihil Dukhturan with orders to bring back Kazim Beg, giving as the reason that he had heard that Kazim had not been allowed to enter Russian ter ritory and that it was not advisable that he should be allowed to stay on the % frontier. 24. It appears, however, that Kazim has left for Bala Murghab. He has sent Puri Khan with one of his syces and a portion of his escort back to Herat. 25. The Russians inspected the bridge on the 11th, but were not able to under take the repairs it needed as the amount of money to be placed at their disposal was not sufficient. r . 26. Letters addressed to the Naib-ul-Hukumah and the Maulvi BarkatuHah from Kazim Beg arrived on the 14th instant, and the next day von Gruden sent for his messengers Faiz-ullah and Ghulam Rasul and ordered them to prepare for a journey to Meshed. On the same day von Gruden aired his belonging : it is rumoured (perhaps in consequence) that he also intends to leave Herat. ^ 27. An itinerant trader stated on the 16th instant that 200 Russain sowars had come to the frontier near Chihil Dukhturan to arrest Kazim Beg. 28. News from Turkestan and Transcasyia.—No further fighting between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks is reported : the latter are said to be entrenching them selves in the vicinity of the railways. Consternation is felt along the Persian frontier: an invasion by the successful Bolsheviks being confidently expected. It is rumoured that the Turkomans are now two parties : one still in sympathy with the Mensheviks, and the other inclined to side with their enemies. Meshed : W. G. GREY, Lt.-Colonel, The 24th August 1918, &gt; His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and ) Agent of the Government of India in KJwrassan,COW^ CONFIDENTIAL. f Meshed Diary No. 35, lor the week ending the 31st August 1918. 1. Persian officials. The Matamid-ul-Wizarah has arrived at Darajaiz. No opposition on behalf of the late Governor was exhibited. Mirza Ahmad Ali Khan has left for Gunabad, having arrived at Meshed &gt;early in the week (paragraphs 1 and 2 last week.) 3. Persian affairs (local ).—No further action has as yet been taken in connec tion with the elections for the proposed National Assembly, as I have not re plied to the enquiry of the Kawwam as to whether there was any objection to the publication of his proclamation (paragraph 5 last week). with zeal and energy on every subject upon which we require information ; such as the supposed presence of enemy spies and agents in the town. During the week a Russian subject (Caucasian Turk) lost 1,250 roubles in the bazar which nearly every house ajid place of business. !Numbers of shops are closed, and the work of most offices is sadly interrupted. Many of our troops, both regulars and levies, have become temporarily unfit for duty, and several members of the European community are sufferifing from the disease. 6. Persian affairs {general ).—The Sirdar Intisar (paragraph 4 last week) has arrived at Turbat-i-Haidari where he appeared to run short of money as he tele graphed from there to the Governor General asking for more funds to enable him to carry out his mission. He does not seem to have received a very sympathetic reply, being merely told to proceed on his duty. It is not supposed that Aziz-ullah will offer armed resistance to this force : he will probably make his submission. This is the last serious opposition to the rule of the Kawwam-us-Saltanah that now remains in Khorassan. 7. News has been received in Meshed of the peace made between the British and the Jangalis at Resht, and a suppose^! list of the terms arrived at is publish ed in the city. Some are probably correct, but one says that we have no right to interfere in Persian affairs ; which is apparently to be taken to mean that we have promised not to do so in future. 8. The recent execution of certain members of the Society of Terrorists in Tehran and the imprisonment of others is recognised here as a good move, and the ‘measures will no doubt have their effect upon the small and ever decreasing number of extreme democrats who still cling to their tenets. 9. British affairs .—We have been busy during the week collecting additional port purposes now on the books of the local Supply and Transport Officer has risen to over 1,600 in spite of the fact that this is harvest time and that camels are engaged in the conveyance of grain from out-stations to the large towns. Mules are almost impossible to find : there are none in Meshed or its immediate neighbour hood, and in the province generally the numbers are far below normal owing to the scarcity of last year which destroyed enormous quantities. The question of 2. Rukn-ul-Wizarah, the late Karguzar of Sistan, has been appointed Rais- i-Tazkirali (Passport Officer) in Meshed, and has taken up his work. He visited me on the 26th instant. 4. The work of the police department continues to be very satisfactory’ Everything for which we find it possible to ask is done, and enquiries are made were found by a Persian tradesman. The police promptly discovered the matter and returned the money to its owner. 5. An epidemic of influenza has appeared in the town which has attacked transport and additional grain for our troops. The number of camels for trans- eugaging wheeled transport is receiving consideration.2 The purchase of grain is proceeding at fair prices, but there is a feeling among proprietors of fear lest another form of scarcity, caused by the presence of so mZ foreigners, may arise, and some show disinclination to part with their stocks. We wffl, however, collect a sufficient quantity to meet probable requirements. 10 Maior Daukes, Political Department, left for Bujnurd on the 29th instant armed whh a letter of recommendation to the Chief. The latter has telegraphed to“he Karguzar asking on what business he is coming and how he should be received The Karguzar has referred the questions to me, ana a suitable reply has been given to him. The Kawwam also supplied a letter recommending Major Daukes to the attentions of the Chief. T 11 The levy platoons are still in Meshed : they are suffering severely from the epidemic mentioned above. Recruiting for the Khorassan levy corps is not proceeding as brisky as was hoped, but the harvest upon which so many young men are It present engaged together with general improvement in economic conditions militates against recruitment. 12 Russian affairs .—Our proclamation mentioned in paragraph 13 last week has produced an excellent effect in the town, especially among the Cauca sian community. My colleague, however, whether by design or accident is not vet quite clear, published some copies together with copies of a telegram from the Russian Minister at Pekin describing the action taken m the Far Fast m regard to the restoration of property.and other measures which may be regarded by the Mensheviks as contrary to revolutionary doctrine. This communication had just reached him from Tehran, and his explanation is that for the sake of convenience he brought it out with our proclamation : but it appears possible that the combi nation was designed to prove that the Allies were working in the interests of the old regime. The matter is still under consideration. 13 The recent events across the frontier which are referred to elsewhere are commanding much attention in Russian circles as can only be expected, but our intentions are still regarded with suspicion by many of our Russian friends in Meshed. This is explained principally by the fact that we have expressly declared that any action taken by us in Russian territory is not in consequence of a preference for any political party. 14. Mir Murtaza, the Caucasian leader, who was prominent in the intrigues of de Beauvais against my colleague some time ago, has returned to Meshed and called upon me during the week. He asked for the latest news with great show of interest, expressed joy at the satisfactory position in France, and offered to help us in any direction such as propaganda in which his services could be utilised. I am arranging to employ him : at first in minor and unimportant matters. 15. Doctor Agapiev, who has for some months been residing in Meshed as a refugee from Russia, has been appointed Medical Officer to the Persian Cossack force in Tehran and leaves shortly. It is said that Dr. Chiriaiev, Medical Officer to the Russian Consular establishment here is to be placed in charge of the Cossack Brigade in Meshed. 16. News from Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam .—Captain Preston, S.P.R., has been ordered to return to Kirman at once by the shortest route ; and all purchase of animrls in Khorassan by outsiders is stopped in view of possible requirements by our own forces (paragraph 23 of Diary No. 33). 17. News from, Herat.—I have received a more than usually cordial reply from the Naib-ul-Hukumah to a letter expressing regret and sympathy on account ,of his recent accident (paragraph 25 of Diary No. 32). He seems to have recoverd # 18. The Governors of Kuhsan and Sabzawar arrived at Herat on the 16th instant. It is believed that both have been dismissed. 19. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has issued a warning that no attention is to be paid by Afghan subjects to any foreigners who may pass through their lands, and that they are not to discuss such persons among themselves on pain of punish ment. 20. It is slid that all merchandise recently sent into Russia for sale from Herat via Panjdeh has not been sold owing to the fact that new Russian noteswhich are not accepted are profferred in payment. Some anxiety is felt jest the goods may be raided where they are. 21. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered that 50 picked sowars be detailed for durbar and other duties at Chahar Bagh : his own orderlies being at present overworked. 22. Kazim Beg (paragraph 24 last week) has returned to Herat. He announces that all his efforts to cross the frontier were unvailing but gives no definite reason. He is said to have come in with two companions whose identity has not yet trans pired. 23. On the 17th instant a large party of Bussian men, women, and children, amounting in all to about forty persons, arrived at Bagh-i-Shiwan (paragraph 30 of Diary No. 33), accompanied by some 30 loaded camels bearing their posses sions. 24. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has reported to the Amir that a party of Russians hade ome to the frontier asking to be allowed to become Afghan subjects'and offer ing to the Afghan Government the possession of Panjdeh and Sheikh Junaid. To a former reference of this nature it seems that His Majesty made a cold reply, but the Naib, maintaining that he has not understood the matter, has again referred it. Pending the receipt of a reply he has posted a Colonel of Artillery at Chihil Dukhturan. 25. On the 19th instant ten of the Russian men mentioned in paragraph 23 above visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah and remained with him for one hour. It is not known what passed at the interview. 26. On the 20th the Naib-ul-Hukumah arranged with the Russian engineers to order forty iron rods (girders 1) from Russia for the repair of the Malan bridge. 27. Two more Russians arrived at Herat on the 21st. They are said to have been well dressed, carrying medals, etc. The Naib-ul-Hukumah asked them from what part of Russia they came and was told from Takhta Bazar. He then enquired where they would like to stay and was informed in the Bagh-i-Shiwan with their compatriots. The Naib gave orders accordingly. One of these two men is said to be a German ; and the Naib-ul-Hukumah has asked the Russian at. Bagh-i-Shiwan whether they have any objection to living with him there. It is not yet known what reply they gave to this question. 28. Prom information that reached our Agent on the 23rd instant he has the impression that the leader of the party of Russians which has arrived in Herat recently is the authority who has offered to hand pver Shaikh Junaid to the Afghans. Further information on this point and also bn the subject of the refugees is awaited. 29. News from Turkestan and Transcaspia.—Tht Menshevik force was heavily attacked by the Bolsheviks assisted hy l escaped enemy prisoners on the 28th instant near Kahka. At first the attacking force gained some advantage,, but at 5 p. m. when the attacks ceased the advantage lay with the Mensheviks. JThe losses incurred by the latter were slight, but they included 4 Indian soldiers killed and thirteen wounded, and four British officers wounded, one severely who has since died. The losses of the enemy are said to have been heavy; they lost five machine guns and a quantity of rifles. No serious fighting is reported to have taken place since; and as the Menshevik force has been reinforced there seems to be no cause for anxiety, but the conduct of the Turkomans seems to leave much to be desired. This may, however, improve with the advent of reinforcements. Meshed ; The 31st August 1918. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consid-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorassan. G. M. Presa, Simla.—No, C453 F.D.—27-9-18 30 B.C.R*CONFIDENTIAL. ^ 1 % -..Jr Meshed Diary No. 32 for the week ending the 1 Oth August 1918. 1. Persian officials Shahzadah Mustafa Mirza, the late Governor of Turshiz, arrived at Meshed on the 9th instant. 2. On the evening of the 3rd instant I called upon the Kawwam-us-Saltanah to discuss the replacement of the present Governors of Darajaiz and Kalat, and found that for Darajaiz he had selected the man for whose appointment I intended to press. This is the Matamid-ul-Wizarah for whom we have tried to find a post for some time. A suitable man will also be nominated to Kalat. 3. Persian affairs (local). —The Governor-General has telegraphed to Tehran recommending that the following Government sowars should be posted at once to guard the frontiers :—65 at Khaf ; 65 at Darajaiz ; 60 at Sarakhs ; and 65 at Bajgiran. He proposes to add to this number himself, later. 4. The elections for the Meshed Municipal Council are concluded. The large majority of the successful candidates are domocrets : though many of them are of the moderate order. 5. The Governor-General’s indignation has been aroused by the publication in Meshed of a circular from the Ministry of Commerce, etc., which was apparently sent direct to the local office without going through him. He has confiscated the copies of the circular, and has referred the matter to Tehran. 6. Persian affairs (general). —There are no further cholera reports, and the danger of the disease reaching Meshed seems to be at an end for the present. The quarantine arrangements have worked better this year than last: no doubt owing to the efiorts of Dr. Amir ’Alam of Tehran, who is still in Meshed, and the advice given by our Medical Officers. \ 7. The Hazara Chief, Saiyid Haidar, is finding some difficulty in realising the 200 rifles required of him by the Governor-General (paragraph 6 of Diary No. 30). His secretary, one Sarfaraz Khan is determined to get his master into trouble, and has told all the elders to deny the possession of arms in order to compel Saiyid Haidar to take them from the petty land-owners who have one or more rifles for self protection : knowing that this will lead to disturbance in the tribe. 8. British affairs.-— IlYlq value of the goods which paid duty at the Meshed Customs House only during the month of Sartan (22nd June to 23rd July) amounts to fourteen and-a-half lakhs of rupees according to the present official rate of exchange for Consular reports, viz., ^0 krans Xo £l sterling or 15 rupees. More than thirteen lakhs represents soft sugar, which was formerly imported from Russia. It is believed that few factories and refineries are now working in Russia, and there is now a demand for sugar from the same districts from which it was formerly imported. The Governor-General has forbidden the export to Russia of various articles of which sugar is one ; the reason given being the fear of rise in local prices. Raw silk is another such article : it is believed to be indispensable for the manufacture of military balloons. 9. On the night of the 7th and again on that of the 8th instant the Meshed- Sistan telegraph line was interrupted ; on the first occasion near Turbat-i-Haidari, and on the second at Rui Khaf. Investigation shewed that the second interrup tion was almost certainly the result of some mistake on the part of one of our own people, but the first was undoubtedly caused by some outside influence. Turbat- i-Haidari being a strong democrat centre foul play is suspected, and enquiries are being made. The temporary appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Turbat would be useful, and is again being recommended, in view of the obstructive influence in the town.10. I approached the Director of Telegraphs in connection with a proposal ta establish a military telephone from Meshed to Muhammadabad in the Darajaiz district where onr troops are stationed. He promised to ask permission from his Minister in Tehran, and the reply which came in due course was non-committal and left matters very much as they were. , In reply to a question as to what should be done next the Director recommended action being taken as if permission had actually been received. This was done, and a formal protest politely acknowledged as previously arranged with the Director. 11. The Karguzar of Turbat-i-Haidari is still trying to be obstructive^ being evidently under the thumb of the democrat body above mentioned. He conti nually reports to the Foreign Office direct the movements of our Agent and his news-writers ; and has been'snubbed by the Meshed Karguzar for this independent action. 12. Russian affairs. —On the 7th instant the Governor-General arrested two Caucasian ruffians both of whom were suspected of anti-M\j intrigue, and on the following day delivered them to us. These two had both been deported to .Russia by the Russian authorities in the days of their power, and no objection was raised by my colleagues. Yesterday they were despatched to India (or Sistan as may be subsequently decided) in company with two other suspects who had been detained by us: one a Persian who had been at one time, in company with Nieder- mayer, and the other a Turkish reservist who was arrested by the Military post at Sharifabad while endeavouring to return to his home via Meshed on release from confinement in Russia. 13. The circular referred to in paragraph 5 above promulgated an order of the Government presided over by Samsam-us-Saltanah annulling all treaties and agree ments concluded with the Imperial Russian Government during the past century, and cancelling all concessions made to Russian subjects. The Government of Samsam having now fallen no importance is considered to be attached to this demonstration. 14. A report having been received that three Caucasians recently came from Baku with letters from Turks for Caucasians here the matter has been placed in the hands of the police who are working loyally for us. They are watching one Agha Buzurg, the nephew of the local Bokhara Tajir Bashi, who is suspected of being a spy. 15. A member of the new Askabad Menshevik Government named Dukhorv has arrived in Meshed. The popular idea is that he has come to invoke the assis tance of British troops against the Bolsheviks. ,r I 6 ;,The police inform us that 40 to 50 Caucasian refugees have arrived in Meshed from the country to the north of Baku; whence they had fled on account of the position resulting from recent Bolshevik victories. Our friend Mir Murtaza ias denounced Dr. Nasir Begoff, a Caucasian doctor of medicine who recently came to Meshed to spread pan-Islamic views. We have also heard from others of this man s anti-AAiy piopaganda, and his arrest is under consideration. . 17 * and German htirigues.—Qne ■ meeting of democrats was held during the past week, and the conversation was chiefly on the subject of the British. It was said that they had been defeated near Tabriz by a force of Turkish troops assisted by Mujahids; and later the companv were informed that the Turks intend ed to make a cordon from Tabriz to Resht, and that the Germans had already sent arms to the Janghs and would send more so that when these arms had all been received and the cordon completed the British should be finally ejected from Resht. It was also stated that the Turks had sent many spies to Khorassan to persuade the tribes to rise against the British, particularly the Taimuris and Baluchis who were b minis. 18. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —A party of 50 Kurramis has arrived at Jam en route for Meshed on pilgrimage. cm • 19 ' i /^/^^“There is unfortunately a chance of trouble between bhuja-ul-Mulk and the Governor-General. The former intended to go to Meshed as reported in paragraph 23 of last week’s Diary, but was advised by some intriguerto refrain for fear of retention at Meshed and subsequent dismissal from his post, I hear now that the Governor-General intends to dismiss him for not coming, and our friend Nusrat-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Khaf, has asked my permission to try for the appointment.' I hope to discuss the matter this evening with the Kawwam. 20. Our Agent has arrested an Indian coming from Herat. It is not yet known who or what he is, what he is to be sent to Meshed. 21. News from Herat. —The export of sugar and dyed longcloth to Russian territory is reported. If this, continues and expands the Governor-General of Khorassan will have to reconsider the prohibition of exports recently issued by him. 22. The relations of the Austrians with the Russian General and his wife are said to be very close: the former frequently visit the latter in their residence at Shir wan, a village near Herat. 23. Von Gruden wishes to send the messenger Samandar (paragraph 27 of Diary No. 29) with a letter to Baku, the answer to which he is to bring back with all speed. There is a difference of opinion by what route he should go; von Gruden wishing him to take that via Russia, and the man himself advocating the Meshed route. 24. Nasrullah stated on the 30th ultimo that Wagner was now in Russia (pro bably Transcaspia) where he held the rank of General, and that he will soon come to Herat with troops. On the same day another Russian, also accompanied by his wife, arrived at Herat from Chihil Dukhturan. He was sent to Shirwan, and accommodated with the first Russian. 25. Kazim Beg received on the 31st ultimo letters which much pleased him. He sent them to the Naib-ul-Hukumah who was later closeted with the Naib Salar for about half an hour. Subsequently urgent search was made in the town for the men who had brought Kazim Beg the letters, and a Kurami, one of a caravan which had recently arrived from Kabul, was produced. This man said that it was not he who had carried the letters : that they had been handed over by a nomad who had joined the caravan during its journey and who was still with Kazim Beg. The Kurrami was allowed to go. On the 1st August the Naibs visited Kazim Beg and were with him for about an hour. The interview is described as secret although the Austrians were pre sent, and it is said that Persian affairs were discussed. On the way home the Naib- ul-Hukuma’s horse came down with him, and his left hand was seriously hurt. He succeded in reaching the town on foot, and is under treatment by the Indian doctor. 26. It is believed that Ahmed Barbari, the servant of the German party who escaped recently from the Sistan Consulate prison, has left Herat, but it is not yet known where he has gone. Later news announces the departure of Kazim Beg accompanied by his men Haji Ahmed and Asghar and four loaded ponies. They are believed to have crossed the Russian border, and Kazim is said to have stated that he was going to receive some German Turkish General. 27. News from Turkestan and Transcaspia. —Notwithstanding a/good havest bread is still dear at Askabad. It is now reported that the Mensheviks have been victorious over the Bolsheviks at Merv, Panjdeh, and Charjui: and that the Turkomans have again allied themselves with the Mensheviks who are distributing arms among them and are promising money. The Turkoman sowars from the frontier : notably from Sarakhs: have been called to Taj end to support their brethren, but a number have come in to Persian Sarakohs desiring leave to remain there as they do not wish .to fight. The Persian authorities have not yet replied to this proposal. W. G.

British force.-~C 2 i])ta.m Jarvis returned from Transcaspia on the 5th instant. Lieutenants Eorsyth and Antelme returned from Muhammadabad on the 9th instant. 282. Reports from province. —Semnan reports on 31st July some unrest in sympathy with matters at Teheran. Suspicion was entertained of all “foreigners” (presumably residents of other towns) and they—including our correspondent— were ordered summarily to leave the town. At Sabzwar on 3rd instant some disagreement among officials is reported. No further details regarding the alleged collection of grain at Zulfiqar have yet been reported from Zorabad. Before his return to Meshed recently Nusrat- ubMulk executed Yussuf Ali and two other robbers. No recent suspicious arrivals are reported from Kuchan. A correspondent writes on the 5th instant that the Musavat party are inciting people against the English, and endeavouring to prevent the sale of grain supplies to them. One Meshedi Agujan, a friend of the druggist Ghulam, and formerly deported by the Pussians is reported active in this connection. Several officials are noted as unfriendly. It is reported from Bujnurd at the end of the month that the Sardar has accepted the Governorship of Astrabad on condition that the Government sanctions the up-keep of 300 savars for that district. He has apparently further stipulated that they be paid at gendarmerie rates and provided with rifles. The two Pussians, whose arrival was reported, are stated to be purchasing opium. Sarakhs, writing at the end of the month, states that after the arrest of the Bolshevik Commissary, authority at Russian Sarakhs was for a time exercised by the son of the Turkoman MangliKhan. but that he and his men subsequently left for Chajui to take part in the fighting against the Bolsheviks. It was reported from Daragiz at the end of the month that previous to the arrival of the Indian troops a meeting was held at which the local officials were present to concert measures to prevent their coming. So far no result was attained, and it is probable that with the change of Governor and better acquaintance this unfriendly attitude may be modified. No escaped prisoners have been reported from the districts during the week. Herat and Afghanistan. 283. Germans and adherents. —Kazim Beg is reported to have made arrangements to communicate with the Turkish forces near Baku. According to latest information, he with 2 adherents Hajji Ahmad and Asghar, left Herat secretly by night (actual dale not clear) with 4 baggage animals. It is supposed that he is proceeding to the Russian frontier to meet a German and a Turkish representative. At the same time the remote possibility of his attempting to cross into Persia cannot be entirely discounted. Por description of all 3 indivi duals please refer to Intelligence Summary Number 6 of 1917 under numbers 19, 21 and 24. Such steps as are possible for his detention should he cross the Russian frontier have been taken. 284. Herat troops. —Officers have been ordered to make proficient in rifles and sword practices under penalty of dismissal. After inspection of the new cavalry regiment the Naib Salar expressed satisfaction at the progress made, and promoted several instructors from the ranks to commissioned or non-commissioned ranks. In these promotions he included two of his own orderlies as rissaldars. ■\ !Soldiers of Kabul serving at Herat having applied for leave to visit their families^were originally refused leave, but /^-h ” ^ man producing a suitable recruit was to be granted 6 months furlough. It is stated that owing to the hard work now e^W rf the men no tecraits onnld be found to come forward voluntarily— possibly also owing to the hasht vak ” The men therefore applied for their families to be sent from Kabul to which the Naib Salar replied that owing to the imminent possibility of Afghan- istan being involved in the war no such action could be contemplated. 285 ° Frontier .—According to the statement of an arrival from Herat wbiefreaukL confirmation, orders had been issued at Herat for a considerable portion ot the regular cavalry at Herat to proceed to frontier posts between Kafir Kilah and Kushk.

British Force.-—One troop of the 28t,h Light Cavalry left Meshed on the 20th instant tor Kuchan. This party was accompanied by Captain Samad Shah and Lieutenant Antelme. The mixed force (1 company 19rh P. I. and 1 troop 28th L. C.) reached Kuchan on the 26th instant whence they will move to Muhammadabad in the Daragiz district. One platoon of the 19th Punjabis left for Kuchan on the 24th instant under Lieutenant Cavalier. Captain Teague Jones and Lieutenant Whrd proceeded to Transcaspia on tthe 22nd instant. 255. Kwc/hm.—Collection of arms from the retainers of Shujah-ad-Daulah is reported. The local Khans are said to have been much alarmed at the arrest of Shujah, and had prompt advantage of this been taken a number of rifles would have been recovered without difficulty. No movements of prisoners are reported. 256. Shahrud and Sabztvar. —No fresh arrivals of prisoners are reported. Both places are reported quiet for the time being. 257. Sarakhs. —A Turkoman Khan named Babar with a band of about 100 men has arrested the Bolshevik representative at Kussian Sarakhs. By some accounts this individual fled. 258. Bujnurd —The arrival of 2 Russians there was reported by telegraph on the 24th instant. From information which has reached the Provincial Direc tor of Customs three Georgians who had arrived there armed from Russian territory had been detained, and it is probable that these are the same indivi duals. 259. Langar. —Mir Baqui Sultan has so far avoided visiting the Governor of Jam, Jalal-as-Sultan, at Mahmudabad, during settlement of a land dispute a Barbari was shot by Persian Cossacks and another arrested and brought in to Mahmudabad. Some 20 Barbari families reached Langar from Herat on the 18th instant. They stated that they had experienced great difficulty in leaving Afghanistan by stealth as Barbaris were now being forcibly conscripted by the “ Hasht-yak ’* system. They reported seeing at Garmab-i-Shahun in the Hazarajat district, on June 16th two Germans on their way to Kabul escorted by 10 Afghan savars. 260. Zorahad. —150 savat't were recently collected at Zorabad by Nusrat-ul- Mulk for service with him in the Khaf district. Sayyid Ahmad Beg Jam- shadi has left for Chaman-i-Bid where he is credited with the intention of collec ting Jamshadi families for eventual settlement at Barashk. 261. Local. —Information from a source hitherto reliable points to a close watch being kept on our military movements and strength by the Caucasian colony here through the medium of its secret committee. A Caucasian recent ly returned from Baku is reputed—correctly or incorrectly—to have taken information on this head to that town and to have returned with instructions for more accurate information, secret purchase of grain supplies, and communi cation with Afghanistan through Kariz. Two messengers are reported to have left for Transcispia by different routes with the information of the departure of our detachment for the Russo-Persian frontier. Every attempt is being made to check the accuracy of these stitements with a view to the necessary action should they prove correct. The affair of Doctor Riza Khan is still under investigation. He has admitted former connection with the Turco-German party in Persia.2 i A Tuilr, arrested at Sharif^M while returning from Russia where he liad been interned since the war, is detained by the Consulate-General as is also a, Persian member of Niedermever’s party, captured by the Russians at Kain and imprisoned in Russia whence he has escaped in the prevalent disorders. Heiia-t and Afghanistan. 262. Germans and adherents.—Tha messenger Samandar, recently re turned from Kabul, states that Siddiq Beg to whom he was sent despatched his- companions Sher Ali to Peshawar witn letters, and Muhammad Sarwar Barbari to Bokhara and Turkistan. Hajji Hussain Ahluliah reached Herat from Meshed and delivered a letter to Kazim Beg. f In the course of his propaganda Kazim stated that Turkish troops would reach the Afghan border by the 24th July. 263. 'Recent measures.—'Khz following measures have been ordered by the Naib-ul-Hukumah :—• (a) A relay post formed of khavanin on the Herat-Kabul road via the Hazarajat. Orders have been given for strict supervision of the men. (b) Arrears of revenue (presumably both in kind and cash) to be paid up without delay. The Naib Salar lias been directed to take measures to enforce repayment. (c) As few prisoners as possible to be retained in Herat prison.. Actual inmates to he dealt with summarily as far as possible^ and others to be released on security. This is in accordance with Sifarman from the Amir. 264. T)ahnah-i-7iulfiqar .—It is reported from Zorabad that both at Zulfiqar and Khatai frontier p&lt;&gt;sts&gt; both of which are said to comprise about 100 mem 48 hhanvars of wheat have been put in instead of the normal 12 kharwars- Further investigation is being made. 265. The Naib *alar —On the occasion of the “Id * in the presence of the Naib-ul-Hukumah and other notables, the Naib Salar spoke to the following effect. The fire of war surrounded Afghanistan and it behoved all to exercise the greatest care to avoid being injured by the conflagration. He was happy to&gt; state that many of the defects of the Afghan military organisation had been removed, and that daily improvement could be noted. Many of the Govern ments engaged in the war against Germany had made peace, and France and Italy were on the point of doing so. Britain alone held out, and was only enabled to do so by the absence hitherto of internal trouble. He called atten tion to the plight of the formerly powerful Russian Empire, and to the fact that many intelligent and skilled persons of that country had solicited employment in Afghanistan. He added that arrangements to give them employment had been made. 266 Russian refugees. —The Russian “General,” accompanied by his wife, reached Herat on the 14fh instant and was accommodated in a garden at Shirwan near the town. His identity is not yet clear but he is stated to be an architect. He was visited by Kazim Beg soon after arrival. Four other R ussians are reported to have reached the frontier at Kara Tapa* and instructions to bring them to Herat have been given. 267 Intelligence. —The Naib Scdar is reported to have deputed Major Khuda Baksh Khan (previously sent by him to Kushk for information on several occasions? to proceed to Baku in order to bring him accurate intelligence of the progress of the Turkish troops. 268. Military. The Isaib Salar has detailed an escort of 20 men per battalion to accompany an ordnance convoy to Farah. It is not yet known whether the convoy will comprise rifles only or whether ammunition and other stores will be added.3 Hifles have been issued to the new cavalry regiment for instructional pur poses. The two formed cavalry regiments have been ordered to drill in the open country up to 12 noon daily. Artillery recruits have been put to foot drill. Trained men should be thoroughly practised in gunnery drill. The Naib Solaris expected to undertake a tour to the frontier shortly. Russian Turkistan? 269. Current events .—Owing to the fitful interruption of railway and telegraphic communications in Turkistan and Transcaspiait has been impossible to obtain in any detail satisfactory news of the course of events. There appears to be no doubt of the complete defeat of the Bolsheviks at and westward of Askhabad, and occasional firing at Askhabad reported up to the 18th instant, was apparently occasioned by the mopping up process. On about the 21st instant a detachment of about 1,000 Mensheviks was despatched to Merv to take over the authority there from the Bolsheviks who were not expected to offer resistance. This is as far as can be ascertained in addition to a Menshevik detachment previously sent towards Charjui. It is also reported that Kolesov had assembled what forces he could at Tashkent and intended to move on Askhabad, in which case the probability of a collision near Charjui seemed to he indicated. The latest news to hand is that such a collision has actually occurred in that neighbourhood and that the Mensheviks were getting the best of it. This, however, requires confirmation. Up to the 18th instant there was no definite news of a move from the Bokharan side. The Amir is stated to have not less than 70,000 men under arms and to have distributed his main forces at various points in the Bokhara district. The difficulties he has had in controlling his Afghan contingent are confirmed by news to that effect from Herat. It is rumoured that some at least of his Afghan adherents are in reality Afghan soldiers who have been allowed to proceed sub rosa from Afghan Turkistan. The Armenians who remained neutral during the first Bolshevik and Menshevik fracas, sided with the Mensheviks on the second occasion, and men from 18 to 85 have been called up The Armenian Committee report that they have arrested and imprisoned one German agent and that they are watching others, among the cumber being Ebert who is now at Kushk according to their information. It appears increasingly probable that the Turkish progress towards Baku is having its effect on the Turkoman. Colonel Khan Yomudski, the head of the Yomud in the Krasnovodsk rayon, stated with frankness that the sympathies of that tribe are now with the Turks&gt; and active Turkish propaganda is reported among the Tekke sections. The presence of Turkish agents among the Turkoman near Hushakh has also been noted. Meshed ; 27th July 1918. E. A. E. REEL, Lieut. Colonel, G. S. 0. 1. S1265GSB —45 — 5*3*18 -GCPS) n cr\ M XI .

Reports fmm Kuchan quiet. Sabzwar; the governor is active in hunting down robber bands. Several executions have taken place. Shahrud; reported quiet, no Jangali mainfestations observed there. At none of the above places are escaped prisoners reported. More Barbari families have reached Langar from Herat, having suffered depredation by the way at the hands of Kaudani robbers. Three of their party are reported killed. The lllbegi Kaudani is stated to be making overtures of friendship to Savyid Haidar Barbari. Rumours of the proximate arrival of German troops are current in Jam, and are said to be causing much satisfaction. 271 Local —Further reports of the activity of the Caucasian committee in reporting our movements to Turkestan have been received. They are much interested in Dr. Riza Khan, of whose connection with Turkish agents in Persia and in Russian territory there seems little doubt. The man himself has naturally protested his innocence. Captain Preston of the South Persia Rifles brought into Meshed 3 indivi duals arrested by him at Tabas on suspicion of being the Turks reported to have fled from Meshed towards Kir man. They proved to be Tabriz! eye-doctors who have been perambulating the districts south of Meshed for some months, and in the absence of any proof, were at the request of the Governor-General, set at liberty and sent to him. As their work lends itself to propaganda and suspicions have since been expressed regarding them it is as well that they should be watched in their further movements. I Herat and Afghanistan. 273. Military afiairs^Qn the 23rdinstant a convoy of 140 camels carrying ammunition were despatched with an escort of 45 men to Farah. 680 bo * es small arms ammunition were sent, 400 being English and the remainder Kabul mader The canids are tp bring back saltpetre for Herat Mistri-khanah. A small convoy of boots and buttons has been received from Kabul via Farah, and other stores for Herat are said to be ready and awaitmg transport.

Germans and adherents .—Kazim Beg is now announcing the seige of Paris and the desperate plight of the French nation. Beyond this little activity is reported. 275. Refugees .— The Russian “ General ”, now said to be an engineer, was summoned to Herat from Shirwan for an interview. He is apparently receiving considerate treatment. 276. Revenue .—Various measures are being taken to ensure the correct collection of the grain revenue in kind. Considerable importance is evidently attached to this, as also to the storage of hay in various places, which has been reported before. 277. Cholera. —Cholera is reported to have made its appearance at Mazar- i-Sharif from Russian territory. Russian Turkistan. 278. Current events. —News received last week is generally confirmed. The Menshevik railway-men are in possession of Transcaspia, having ousted the Bolsheviks from Merv and Bairam Ali and taken some I Ij5oo prisoners. Kushk apparently remains in Bolshevik hands. The expected collision has occurred and according to information telegraphed from the frontier }resterday the fight was still proceeding at the Charjui bridge, the Bolsheviks holding the Turkistan, and the Mensheviks attacking from the western bank. Large numbers of_ Turkoman have joined the Mensheviks and operations at Charjui are said to be under the command of Colonel Oraz Sardar (Oraz Berdy), late of the Turkoman cavalry regiment. Other prominent Turkomans such as Oyezbaev, Makdum Quli Khan son of the Khansha of Merv, and Aziz Khan of Tejen have also identified themselves with the Menshevik cause. The de tachment of the last-named was provided with Russian medical personnel in cluding nurses. The Turkoman are further reported to have declared jihad against the Bolsheviks, and to have announced their intention to conquer or die The Mensheviks are heavily handicapped in the matter of equipment, their opponents being in possession of heavy guns, aeroplanes ( a total of 1 7 reported in Turkistan), and numerous maxims. On the other hand there are grounds to suppose that their ammunition is not over plentiful. Merv reports that up to the 27th instant the Mensheviks had sent 13 field-guns and 29 maxims to Charjui rrom Askhabad and Merv, but we have reason to know that they are anxious for a turther supply. . Th ? serious position in which they stand is fully realised by them, Kolesov having, it is reported, passed a death sentence in advance upon all connected with the anti-Bolshevik rising, and it is known that should the Bolsheviks pull through the most terrible reprisals will be exacted. In case of necessity they are prepared to destroy the Charjui bridge, but they are also apprehensive of a Bolshevik movement from Astrachan against Krasnovodsk. According to latest news the Bolsheviks had brought more guns from Tashkent, but the Mensheviks had in spite of this made some advance. Beyond Charjui all is rumour. Bokhara is reported to have cut up Bolshevik deserters, but had he entered the lists seriously it is obvious that the Bolshevik position would be untenable. It appears fairly certain that from the north-east the Cossacks have reached Perovsk 342 miles from Tashkent. ^ Later rumours place them at about 6 stations north of 1 ashkent-Montai Tash about 70 miles off-and still later and less responsible rumours declare that Tashkent has already been reached. The continued Bol shevik defence of Charjui east bank would, however, discount this Distur bances have occurred in Ferghana in and near Khoqand. Such success as has been attained by the Mensheviks has been by help of the Turkoman, and they themselves reckon on the danger which a powerful Turkoman combination will present in the near future. In the face of the pressing Bolshevik danger, however, they have evidently burnt their boats, and the best asset for their cause is the universal detestation in which Bolshevism is held throughout lurkistan.. — —Addendum. Khorasan and North East Persia. 279. Reports from Mianabad state that no enemy prisoners have been seen for over a month. The Khan who assisted them in the past has ceased doing so and has declared that he is now completely neutral. Addendum. Herat and Afghanistan. 280.

S&lt;'bzwar.-—m^ arrivals of Austrian prisoners are reported up to the 13th instant. Dabir-as-Sultan is stated to be giving satisfaction as Governor, and steps are being taken to arrest various robbers in the vicinity. 247. Langar.— V\\Q Kaudani Ilbegi is reported to have removed his property to the vicinity of the river on hearing a rumour that Persian troops were likely to be sent to Jam. 1 Jalal-as-Sultan is apparently rather nervous of the Barbari attitude and has removed from Abdullabad to Mahmudabad in consequence, He is said to have been gratified at receiving the visit of Sayyid Murtaza of the Dehzan^i section. s 248. Prisoners.—A. report from a somewhat doubtfnl source states that ^ Germans and some Austrian prisoners reached Andarukh recently from Kahka, but that at the former place they renounoed their intention of proceed ing direct to Meshed and turned off towards the Aq Musjid hills. The report is under investigation. r Doctor Baza Khan was placed under police supervision by the Governor- General and yesterday brought to the Consulate-General for interrogation. He admitted former connection with the Turoo-German party in Persia, and his ease is under consideration. The willingness of the Governor-General to assist is most satisfactory. 249. Local.—At a private meeting at the house of Agha Zadah recent events at Tehran were d.scussed. The Meshed Democrat committee have been discussing the Shiraz situation, the disarming of the Indian troops figuring among various exaggerated rumours which had reached them. They also stated that Sheikh Khazzal, the Vali of Pushti Kuh, the sons of Daud Khan Kalhor and the Arabs on the Turco-Persian frontier had joined the Turks against the British. Sheikh Ahmad, editor of the Nan Bahar, has got into trouble with the Democrats for stating that German man-power was near exhaustion. 550. Germans and odherents.—H\\Q German party continue their propa ganda hut appear to weaken their cause by obvious overstatements which no one believes. In accordance with recent instructions from the Naib-ul Hukumah, both they and their adherents are escorted by soldiers when they visit the city, the object apparently being the prevention of the temporaray disappearances which have occurred lately. The messenger Samandar arrived from Kabul with letters for the party at Herat. Copies of these have been secured and are being dealt with by the Consulate-General.

At Se present moment, however, there is no definite information of such action althoug I many rumours, confirmation of which must be awaited, are current. The decision to transfer the headquarters of the Central Asian railway to Tashkent was the immediate cause of the outbreak, railway staff at Vshkahad affected by the order, acquiesced, and themen^withtheiibeloug- in^H, were conveyed towards Tashkent, all available 1st, 2nd and 3rd class carriages being’temporarily requisitioned for the purpose. The railway sta at Kizil Arvat who had previously displayed their antagonism to Bolshevism, categorically refused to obey, upon which Special Commissioner Frolov with a detachment of Bed Guards^ set off for Kizil Arvat He was met on the platform by a peaceful delegation of 5 railwaymen, whom he immediately proceeded to shoot with his own revolver. In response to this somewhat drastic action the railwaymen took the field, Frolov and apparently most of his men being wiped out. The theatre of the conflict was' transferred to Ashkabad, where in the end the Bolsheviks were completely defeated, casual ties on both sides being relatively heavy. At Krasnovodsk the Bolsheviks handed in their arms without any resistance, and apparently something ot me sort occurred at Merv, which is reported to he in the hands of the railway people. According to a report dated the 13th instant at Askhabad, me Bolsheviks were being hunted down like vermin, and were making their escape wherever possible. A wave of anti-Bolshevism was apparently spreading over the province and Turkoman and other elements were voluntarily joining tke Menshevik forces. The further situation is not yet clear, although there are reports that the Menshevik railwaymen are extending the movement to me eastwards. According to reports dated early in the month the Bolsheviks were putting Charjui in a state of defence, ereciing wire entanglements, ana accumulating ammunition there. It may he supposed that their intention was to defend the approach to Turkistan proper in the event of their losing their hold on Transcaspia, but whether any such measure will avail them is a different question. News from Bokhara is still somewhat indefinite and correspondents express suspicion, or at any rate uncertainty, as to the attitude of the Amir. Be is credited by some with the intention of joining the Samarkandis, witk tne eventual idea of adding this district to his dominions, and is supposed to he m secret relations with Afghanistan. Of one thing there appears to be no douht, viz that his khanate is honeycombed with Turko-German intrigue. Bumours are current that he is actually moving a force towards Samarkand, but no actual confirmation has yet been received. &gt;ipM ®jailwciy c©o 3 TH^Tiic 2 itioii in Trcim^jsspici wss intGrmptGd from tlio 12 ili f© the 14th instant. Matters at Tashkent and on the Orenburg line were on the 5th and 6th instant much as reported last week. Schmidt, the Bolsheyik Potitical Resident at Bokhara (and incidentally an able German agent) had fallen out with the Amir and had proceeded to Samarkand and Tashkent, it was surmised with the intention of concerting measures for bringing him to his senses, but it is probable that the whole situation has now changed in those parts. Meshed ; E. A. E. REDR, Lieut r Col., G.S.O.-l Sli90GSB-45~27-8-18—GCPSI CONFIPENJIAL. Meshed Diary No. 30, for the week ending the 1.. Persian officials .—Shahzadah Adal-ud-Daulah has arrived in Meshed. Several persons, including my Russian colleague at the instigation of the Russian Vice-Consul at Turbat : i-Haidari, have tried to secure the reversal of the orders recalling him from the government of Turbat, but without success. 2. Nothing further has been heard of the intrigues against the Kawam-us- Saltanah : His Majesty’s Minister has warned the Persian Government against making the proposed change. It appears that charges of cruelty in dealing with certain criminals has been brought by the interested parties against the Kawwam, but as he has merely acted in conformity with a strict view of the religious law they are not likely to carry much weight. 3. Persian affairs (local).—Attempts have been made during the past few Rays to export to Russia various articles of merchandise imported from India, not ably sugar, but they have been frustrated by the joint action of the Governor- General and M. Delcorde, the Director of Customs. The reasons are probable rise in local prices and uncertainty in regard to the eventual destination of the articles in question. 4. The police organisation under the direction of M. Sjoeberg' and his assis tant Abdullah Khan is proceeding satisfactorily. The former has unfortunately been very ill with typhoid fever,but is able to leave his house and visited me yes terday. He has opened a school for instruction in police work, and 100 men are being trained by instructors brought from Tehran for the purpose. ' 5. Arrangements are being made to proceed with the municipal elections, and the various societies are striving to secure adequate representation for themselves and the reverse for their opponents. 6. The Governor General has satisfactorily settled the outstanding difficulty with the Hazara [Chief Saiyid Haidar. The latter paid a short visit to Meshed .during the week, and was induced by the Kawwam to promise the surrender of 200 rifles in consideration of which all charges against the Chief are to be laid aside. This is an excellent solution, as the section of the tribe presided over temporarily by Saiyid Haidar are too well armed. Charges against the tribe of raids and plundering are to be heard in the local law courts in the usual manner. •7. A telegraphic conversation took place on the 26th July between the President of the Council and the Chief of Bujnurd in the course of which the latter was offered the Government of Astarabad and Goklan. He accepted this on condi tion that Government should recognise and defray the monthly expenses of a force of 300 sowars to be formed from his own men. The President replied to this that there were already 300 Gendarmerie sowars at Astarabad whom he could take over, but added that if this solution was not acceptable the Gendarmerie could be sent elsewhere and his own men engaged as proposed. Finally, the President promised that the matter should be discussed by the Cabinet at an early meeting. 8. Persian affairs (general ).—The province is gradually getting into order. The celebrated robber chiefs of Bajgirn, Sultan and Shah Muhammad, have been arrested and brought in to Meshed where they are now in chains awaiting disposal. At Khaf, Mir Yusuf and two members of his gang have been shot, and two brothers of our levy Daftadar Mir Raza who was also among his companions have been arrested by the Governor of Khaf as security for the Daftadar. A difficult situation has thus arisen : but I have discussed it with the Governor General who finally said that the best plan would be for me to enquire into the charges against the Daffadar and take such steps subsequently as might appear to me to be necessary. His Excellency added that he would be satisfied with any decision I might make.9. One or two more cases of cholera are reported from Kuchan, but the disease appears to be of a type more nearly resembling cholerine. It is moreover dis appearing from the province. 10. British affairs .—On the 22nd instant Cap tain Preston, South Persian Rifles, with a Persian officer and 16 men, arrived at Meshed from Kirman to take over horses and mules which we had bought for the Kirman brigade here. We have procured 24 horses and 55 mules, and Captain Preston is now proceeding to Turbat- i-Shaikh, Jam and Karaiz where we hope that our friends will help him to^ secure more animals and where there are more available than at Meshed. 11. Our missing dak sowar has returned to life (paragraph 19 of Diary No. 29). It appears that he decamped with the gold roubles which he was carrying to Herat surreptitiously, and has recently been captured and sent in to us by Nusrat Lashkir, the local commander of the provincial police. Most of the money and postal articles either have been or will be recovered, and the absconder has been imprisoned pending disposal of his case. ( 12. A local reporter informs us that a large part of the loc^l population are now gratified at the presence of British troops in their neighbourhood. They see that their conduct is uniformly good, particularly towards themselves, and draw a natural I * comparison in this connection between the behaviour of the British and Indians and that of the Russians. Moreover they realise that the recent disturbances on the Russian side of the frontier would have spread to Khorassan were it not for the presence of our men. 13. Russian affairs .—The difficult matter referred to in paragraph 12 last week has been settled. Finding that no sufficient impression was produced upon the firm of Yakubi Zurgagen by the presence of a military guard on their premises, I proceeded on the 22nd instant to set aside a portion of the wool lying in the ware houses with the object of selling it for the benefit of the Imperial Bank should the necessity arise. This apparently produced the required result, as on the following day the sum of 24,000 tumans was paid to the Imperial Bank with a«promise that the balance due, about 7,000, should be paid within a week. The sequestration ol wool then ceased, and the military guard has been withdrawn. 14. The Caucasian party have fallen under suspicion within the last few days r a report having been received by the General Staff Office that they had sent out a man specially to enquire into the dispositions, strength, and equipment of our troops- in Khorasan for the information of German and Turkish agents at Baku. This man. was supposed subsequently to have been despatched to Baku to give the information he had acquired, and to solicit further instructions. I interviewed the Caucasian leader, Mir Murtaza, and he introduced the name of the supposed news-agent himself into the conversation representing that he had been sent at the request of M. Maximoff, Russian Vice-Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari, to fetch his family from the Eastern Caucasus. He denied entirely that there was any communication with our enemies, and offered to send the messenger, whose name is Bakhs Ali, to me. This was done, and from the conversation which ensued I came to the conclusion that the report is incorrect. The Caucasian party will, however, continue to be care fully watched. 15. A member of the Russian “ commercial mission,” the motives and designs of which are still obscure, called upon the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia during the week. He informed him that the society had a representative in London, and that they had remitted to him no less a sum than 1| million sterling during the last three years. The Manager has since been told by M. Kogan, the director of the Russian Transport Company in Meshed which is about to close its business, that he intended to proceed to Russia shortly to obtain the managership of this mission in Meshed.. These indications point to the mission being indirectly, if at all, connected with enemy machinations. 16. Persian and German intrigues .—The democrat society have written to the Meshed mullas asking them not to believe the British statements to the effect that there are German agents among the Janglis. They urge that the Janglis are fighting Ofor the independence of their country, and not at the instigation, of foreigners: that their object in wishing to eject British troops from Persia is purely patriotic. 17. News from Kariz. —It appears that the Baluch Chief Salar Khan is pre paring for war with the local government to whose orders he declines to submit: but i^ is hoped that he will recognise the desirability of submission when he hears that Saiyid Haidar, the Hazara Chr&amp;f, has been treated with reason. 18. News from The arrival of a quantity of Meshed cotton, en route to India, is reported to have occurred on the 12th instant. 19. The Naib-ul-Hukumah is taking further energetic measures for the improve ment of the Kabul-Herat postal service. 20. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has received a firman from His Majesty the Amir directing that a large number of prisoners should not be kept at one time in the prison : they should be dealt with at once according to their crimes or the complaints against them or released on security when summary disposal is not possible. 21. Samandar, the messenger of the German party, gives an account of his recent trip to Kabul (paragraph 27, last week). On arrival at Kabul he and his two companions, Muhammad Sarvar Hazara and Sher Ali Herati, visited Sidik Beg, the Turk. This man sent the Hazara to Bokhara ; Sher Ali to India ; and Samandat to the Austrians at Kabul. He handed over the letters for the latter to them, and as already stated brought replies. He says that there are 28 Austrians now at Kabul: some of whom are in irons for having tried taescape recently. The Austrians are invariably accompanied by a military escort when they go out, but the Turks in Kabul are under no such restric tion. 22. The Russian General mentioned in paragraph 24 last week has arrived in Herat, and hospitable accommodation has been afforded him. It is said that four more Russian officers are about to reach the city from the frontier. 23. Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkaj^ullah called on the Russian general mention ed above, on the 15th instant. It is not known what passed at'the interview. 24. Kazim Beg’s servant Asghar stated on the 17th instant that the British had asked help from the Amir of Afghanistan, but that the Amir had refused on the ground that the Turks were among the enemies of the British. 25. A man who calls himself a maulvi and claims to be of Bulgarian extraction has arrived in Herat from India via Kabul. He says that he wishes to return to Bulgaria, and has taken this route being unable to proceed by sea owing to the war. He has a letter of recommendation from the Mustaufi-ul-Mumalik of Kabul. This mark’s description is given as :—middle size, fair complexion, no beard. Furthec enquiries will be made regarding him. r - 26. The letters mentioned last week will be remarked upon in next week’s Diary. They are in places extremely difficult to decypher. 27. News from Turkestan and Trans-Caspia. —The Government of Askabad is now said to be in the hands of the Mensheviks aided by some Turkomans and Armenians. The Persian Agent has again asked for some Gendarmerie sowars to be sent to him from Meshed. On the night of the 20th instant the Turkoman Chief Baba Jan with about 100 sowars of his tribe took possession of Russian Sarakhs : arrested.the Russian Gov ernor : and assumed the position of Governor. The Karguzar of Persian Sarakhs has consequently telegraphed for instructions regarding the protection of the Persians residing in Russian Sarakhs. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorassan.Q CONFIDENT! At. I Lr;t i ' Ct b 65 30 A'G i r ?3 \ \ 1918 . Meshed Diary No. 31 w^ek ending the 3rd August, 1918. Persian officials.—A telegram was received from Tehran during the week that Aghazadah had already left Meshed for Tehran to intrigue against the Kawwam-us-Saltanah ; but he is still here and will be watched. This shows that there is still some danger. 2. Zulfikar Khan, known as the Imad-ul-Mumalik, the newly appointed Governor of Turshiz, has left for his post with 150 sowars. He has promised to render us any services we may require of him. 3. Shahzadah Adal-ud-Daulah (paragraph 1 last week) called upon me on the 3!st ultimo He did not ask for my help in securing another post, and will have some difficulty in obtaining a Governorship of the importance of that which he has just quitted. His successor, Salar Hashffiat,, lately Secretary to the Governor General, leaves to-morrow for Turbat-i-Haidari. I have asked the Officer Command- mg British troops there to participate in his reception. 4. Shuja-ud-Daulah, the late Governor of Kuchan, has been released from confinement and allowed to 1 occupy a hired house which is guarded by Persian soldiery. ' J 5. We have decided that it is better to transfer Mirza Ahmad Ali Khan (bara- graph 3 of Diary No. 29) from the Government of Kalat, as it is not advisable to have any but tried friends as Governors of the frontier districts. The Governor of Darajaiz is also to be relieved, as he has recently been heard to express anti- British sentiments. The question of replacing these two officials is under-consideration. 6. Persian affairs (local).—-The attitude of the Kawwam-us-Saltanah towards us ; the strength and determination with which he is striving to put the province m order ; and general satisfaction with the conduct of our troops and their presence here have combined to establish quiet and order in Meshed city. He is popular generally, and there is an almost universal desire that he should remain in Khoras- san. When the police organisation is completed (paragraph 4 last wqek) there will be an even greater sense of security. 7. It is rumoured that we have sent troops to Baku to check the advance of the Turks, and general satisfaction is expressed in the town where feeling is against their approach to Persian frontiers. 8- The Governor General has complained to Tehran against the practice of the’Home Office of issuing orders to his subordinate Governors direct. The Foreign Minister, to whom this protest was addressed, has supported it and referred it to the President of the Council. This custom arose in the Naib-us-Saltanah’s time. 9. The editor of the ‘‘Chaman ” newspaper who was recently deported, has been allowed to return to Meshed and his journal will re-appear. He has under taken not to write anything cmta-British in future. 10: Persian affairs (general).—It is rumoured that the Chief of Bujnurd has already left Bujnurd for Astarabad in view of the addition of that terri tory to his Government. The Kawwam spoke to me of this matter, mentioning that the Janglis had agents at Astarabad and that he feared that the Chief might also become connected with them. I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister recommending that no change in the position of Astarabad should be made Ypara- graph 7 last week). P 11. The Dabir-us-Sultan, Governor of Sabzawar, has hanged 7 robbers under the orders of the Governor General.jo British affairs —The Governor General, with the chief local officials, dined at the Consulate General to meet the leader of the Military Mission. In the course of conversation with General Malleson during the evening the Kawwam announced to defend the Khorassan frontier to the last in case of attacks by enemy r- I! troops. 14 Captain Preston (paragraph 10 last week) leaves to-day for Turbat-i-Shaikh Tam The presence of his men here has occasioned considerable comment all of a favourable nature, and he has had many offers of enlistment, which have been declined as he has no orders in that direction. x 'fr- S.?, ft, 15. The Russian Legation in Tehran have protested against the action taken in the Imperial Bank of Persia’s case with the firm of Yakubi and Zorhagan declaring that it has destroyed the position of their Consul-General m Meshed. I have pomted'out however that the injury is, at most, only temporary, and that my colleague will always find me ready to support him when necessary. My relations wifh M Nicnlskv have not been permanently affected by this incident. 16. The preacher Shaikh Inayat-ullah mentioned in paragraph 4 of Diary No. 28 continues to refer favourably to us in his discourses, and considerable atten tion is said to be paid to them. 17. Our offending dak sowar has been handed over to the local Government for disposal (paragraph 11 last week). 18 Russian affairs.—My colleague informed me on the 2nd instant that his Caucasian subjects, with two exceptions, were now on good terms with him and attending his office for their affairs. Mir Murtaza, who is one of the exceptions, came to me on the same day for a pass to proceed to Turshiz via Turbat-i-Haidan. I suspect that the latter is really the object of his journey. 19 On the advice of his head munshi M. Nicolsky sent his (Christian) clerk with two other employes of his Consulate into the Shrine precincts in connection with a case against a shopkeeper whose establishment is within the sacred limits. A dispute ensued, but the clerk was not molested. The other two were imprisoned in the Nazmiah, but subsequently released at my colleague’s request. 20 Persian and German intrigues. —The democrats complain that the coming of Major Sjoeberg and the Kawwam’s attitude towards the British have destroyed their position here. Tep members attended their meeting on the night of the 26th instant. A large amount of discussion on the subject of British troops in khoras san was carried on as usual, but no suggestions were made and no fresh ideas put forward. The condition of affairs in Tehran was then dealt with, and it was actually proposed that the British Legation should be appealed to, apparently to put an end to an intolerable situation, but this resolution was not passed. Later it was decided to send special messengers to the Amir of Bokhara with a view to organise a pan-Islamic movement which was to have for its object the destruction of all Bolsheviks. 21. The circular issued by us on the subject of the recent change of Government at Baku in favour of the Allies produced an excellent effect in the city, but the democrats still refuse to believe in the bond fi&lt;tes of communiques emanating from 'this Consulate. With the exceptom of the democrat community and a few Caucasian Turks the whole town are opposed to a Turko-German invasion of Khorassan, which is supposed to be a possible danger. 22. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Our Levies are expected to arrive about the 15th instant, and certain friends are busy collecting supplies of barley and bhoosa, etc. 23. News from Karaiz.—R&amp;ji Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakharz, is on his way to Meshed with a considerable following. 24 News from Herat— Naib-ul-Hukumah has recently received two firmans from His Majesty the Amir, directing him to watch the frontiers with the utmost vigilance and to send frequent reports to Kabul. »25. On the 21st July the Naib-ul-Hukumah announced in durbar that the Governor and other officials of the Maimanah district had been dismissed on account of tyranny and general misbehaviour, and that the government would be adminis tered by the local military authorities until the next Governor was appointed. 26. The Naib-ul-Hukumah called the Russian General mentioned in paragraph 22 last week to Chahar Bagh on the 19th July. This man is supposed to be a masonry and engineering expert. 27. On the 20th idem Kazim Beg abused his mihmandar and ejected him from the Bagh-i-Kartah. Another has been appointed in his place. 28. Kazim Beg visited the Naib Salar on the 21st, and entertained him with fictitious stories of the bombardment of Paris, distress throughout France, and German successes. 29. Von Gruden stated on the 22nd July that the Russian General had told him that many more Russian officers would come to Herat who being pro-German would help him and his companions. The Naib-ul-Hukumah intends to despatch this man to Kabul, and also other Russian officers who are said to have arrived already at Chihil Dukhtaran. 30. - Kazim Beg announced on the 24th that a Turkish force would soon come to Herat via Askabad. 31. On the following day one of the house servants of the Bagh-i-Kartah ap pealed to the Naib-ul-Hukumah to relieve him from his duties as he could no longer endure the abuse and ill-temper of Kazim Beg. The request was granted. 32. The appearance of cholera at Mazari-Sharif is reported. 33. The letter from Kabul mentioned in paragraph 26 last week consist of one from the Austrians there to the Maulvi Barkat-ullah . one from the Turk Captain Hasan Sadik to von Gruden (apparently) : and one from Lieutenant (or Captain) Schreiner to Corporal von Gruden. The main point of interest are an account of “ treachery ” on the part of Captain Hasan Sadik, who is supposed to have denounced a plot to escape which the Austrians had devised : and references to the treatment received by Khairi Bey who had attempted an^-British intrigue among the Afridisand been surrendered to the Amir by them, to a request which has recently been made by the Amir of Bokhara for help from the Afghan Govern ment, and to the death of Bayerl at the hands of Persian sowars (paragraphs of Diary No. 47 last year). 34. News from Turkestan and Transcaspia.—My colleague informed me on August the 2nd, and his information is borne out by that received from Sarakhs during the week, that the Turkomans who were supposed to be in combination with the Mensheviks against the Bolsheviks were now working alone and opposed to both Russian parties. They appear, however, to have been defeated by He Mensheviks at Merv and Tejend, and are now inviting assistance from all sides in men and money. Further south they have again raided the Persian border at Darajaiz and Persian Sarakhs, and the Karguzar here has sent no less than three protests to my unfortunate colleague who is of course quite powerless to move. •Askabad is still in Menshevik hands according to the latest information, and it is said that the Armenians have been disarmed by them. Our detachment has arrived at Muhammadabad near the Darajaiz frontier, and its presence will pro bably keep the Turkomans from the neighbourhood. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, H. B'M.’s.

A party of 4 Austrians and 4 Turks left the town for Bandar-i-Gnz with the intention of embarking for Rasht. Presumably this is the same party reported to Tehran as having embarked for Sari on June 26th, 232. Langar.—l\\e Governor of Jam. JalaNas-Sultan arrived on the 28th ultimo. He summoned several Barbari headmen most of whom complied, but Sayyid Mohsin, retainer of Sayyid Haidar, did not obey the summons. Mir Baqi Sultan and the Kaudani Ilbaigi are understood to have been summoned to Meshed by the Governor-General, but have not complied with the order. 233.

He was expected to return to Russian territory shortly, 235. Military affairs .—Little work appears to be in progress, 90 remounts have been purchased at Bala Murghab and Maimanah, Colonel Abdurrahman Khan was expected to arrive from Kabul at the end of last month to command the 9th Herati battalion, 236. Hazaras .—There is a further report that Hazaras have received en couragement to emigrate to Herat province from Persia. From another source 150 Hazara families who intended to proceed to Meshed on pilgrimage were prevented by the Naib-ul-Hukumah from leaving Herat, Russian Turkistan. 237. Current -Turkistan remains very unsettled and it is hardly to be expected that much time can elapse without matters reaching a crisis. The conflict at Askhabad on the 17th June was much exaggerated and was merely a local movement caused by the uncertainty of the motives in calling up men from 20 to 35, coupled with dissatisfaction with the Bolshevik committee. A truce has been patched up between the parties but it is not expected to endure for long. The railway workmen, who formed the major part of the Mensheviks strength, seized the guns in store and occupied the railway station; other detachments held stations on the line between Krasnovodsk and Merv and a party of 200 Bolsheviks from Kushk coming to the assistance of Askhabad was detained by them at Tejen, Apparently 20 to 30 casualties were caused. The Armenians appear to have retained their arms. The Bolsheviks are now con* ■nil &gt; J templating rerrovin^ from Askhabad to Merv, which would become the centre of Transcaspian administration. The management of the C. A. Railway has been transferred to Tashkent. To the north the situation appears to be as follows : Orenburg is actually in Bolshevik hands but the line is destroyed for 120 versts to the north and for 69 versts to the south so that the town is isolated. Orenburg Cossacks have risen to support Dutov whose forces have moved down from Turgai to Chelkar on the Tashkent-Orenburg line, north of which place they wiped out 2 Bo’shevik detachments last month who had been sent from Tashkent against them. Further Bolshevik reinforcements refused to leave Tashkent, and the material collected by the Bolsheviks from every available source appears to be of the poorest. The latest estimate gives enemy prisoners in Turkistan at 20,000, of whom 4,000 are Germans, 6,000 Hungarians, and 10,000 Poles and Slavs mostly the latter. The Germans are very anxious to evacuate their prisoners to Russia via Astrachan, and recently succeeded in getting off a train of 400 officers from Tashkent under the guise of invalids. The consignment was, however, stopped at Samarkand and returned to Tashkent under orders from that place. Of some 1,500 Bolshevik troops reported at Tashkent 900 are Hungarian prisoners There is a wholesale exodus of Russian families from Turkistan to Astra chan, nearly 100 families having passed through Krasnovodsk in one week. There have been reports of disturbances in Bokhara which are so far not confirmed but from various reports Shiahs appear to have suffered. The Amir is embarrassed by his Afghan mercenaries of whom he is reputed to be anxious to be rid. There is now an American Consul at Tashkent whose liberty is restricted.

British Force.— One company 19th Punjabis with 2 machine guns reached Meshed on the 12th instant from Turbat-i-Haidari. Captain Pigott and Lieutenant Cavalier, 19th Punjabis, accompanied this party, and Lieutenant Frankau, Supply and Transport Corps, arrived on the same day. Lieutenant Hart, 19th Punjabis, has proceeded on leave, Captain Jarvis returned from Transcaspia during the week. 239. Kuchan.—A general meeting was recently held at Samarkand of branches of the Co-operative Association from which the members of the “ Com mercial Missiondepend. The Kuchan branch has received a remittance of 60,000 roubles and paid 28,000 as one year’s rent for the caravansarai they occupy. 28 rooms are being built in it. A branch is being opened at Shirwan. Rifles and money are being collected by the authorties from the dependents of Shujah-ad-Daulah. r 240. Bandar-i-Gaz .—A correspondent writing near the end of last month states that the Jangalis who arrived during May met with little success either among the towrs-people or the Turkoman and that they subsequently returned. Pan-islam propaganda is reported but apparently no great success has attended it. 1 he names of those active in this ccnnection are Ali Talibov of Enzeli Muhammad Ali Abbasov, and Ghabpur Isfahan!. Twelve Turkish and Austrian prisoners arrived early in June from Shahrud and proceeded to a village 20 miles distant, their subsequent movements being unknown. Another party of prisoners are reported to have made good their escape in a sailing boat and to have escaped the observation of a Russian gun boat from Ashut Ada. Gendarmes and members of the Musavat are said to aid the prisoners. One Rustam Tamirov of Baku is a prominent member of the latter society. It was expected that a hydro-plane would be furnished to Ashur 2^1. Local. It is hoped that the cholera outbreak in the north of the province is less serious than at first reported and that its advance to Meshed may be checked. As far as is known the disease has made little progress at Kuchan. Hoctor Raza Khan, the Turkish suspect arrested and subsequently n^ased at Turbst-i-Haidari, has arrived. He failed to report, as directed, to the Othcer Commanding, Meshed, and in conversation with a reliable person admitted connection with Obeidullah and members of the Turco-German party originally m the Kirman region. His address here has been asceitained and the Governor- General has consented to arrest him. 242. Germans and adherents.—On the 29th ultimo Kazim Beg informed the Naib-ul-Hukumah that Mohendro Partap had written to him, stating that he was about to reach Afghanistan with an important letter for the Amir, The Turco-German party have been making much capital of the proximate arrival of their forces in the neighbourhood of the Afghan frontier. The Naib Salar has refused leave to a medical subordinate on the grounds that it was no time to grant leave when there was a possibility of the arrival of a German force, and the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who had arranged for the departure of his family from Kabul has written to postpone it. 243.

Russian Turkistan. 244. Current events ,—According to fastest reports unrest in Turkistan is on the increase and a feeling appears to be prevalent that events of importance are in the air. There is apparently some recrudescence of disturbance at Askhabad and talk of the possibility of a collision at Kizil Arvat—presumably between Bolsheviks and the railway people. It is also reported that at Askhabad the Bolsheviks have arrested 26 officers, and that in the case of officers who have made good their escape, they intend to proceed against their families. At present this requires further confirmation. From most accounts the position of the Bolsheviks is shaky, and a large proportion of their troops at Tashkent are Persian mercenaries, who are presumably poor material. It is therefore quite possible that they are attempting to assure themselves by harsh measures, hoping thereby to nip m the bud any attempt against them. Reports of the arrival at lashkent of wounded men from the direction of Orenburg, and of the difficulty the Bolsheviks experience in inducing reinforcements to leave for the scene of action continue to be received. Rumours are current that Semirechia Cossacks are movmg on Tashkent. In the light of the severe defeat which they exoerienced in May there does not seem very much probabiliry of thj truth of this report. At the same time it is possible that communication with Dutov may have been established and the concurrence of the remaining Semirechia contingent secured. 1 ne tram load ot German prisoners at Samarkand-estimated between coo and ooo, who on detention there were exceedingly ragged have fitted themselves out with new clothes and some of the party are in the uniform of German officers. They are said to be mostly Bavarians with a sprinkling of Prussian and l°r^o e rt J Sh h S a h 65 at h° te V nd b3rS - There is su far no ^marion of a report that they had been allowed to proceed towards Krasnovodsk. The establishment of an aerial post from Tashkent towards Moscow is reported. It is possible that this is the only means that the Bolsheviks have of communicating beyond the portion of the line blocked by Dutov’s forces. a f r T , ashken t Publish anti British and French articles stating that Bofshevif^ d ^ ^ machinat,ons are responsible for the present plight of vv aniKe - --7 F^P^ciuons ai DOKnara are reported from all sources and it is Turkf^h * bl6 tHat thG collect,on of harvest will witness important events, lurkish and German agents are stated (especially from Armenian sources) to be very active m the Khanate, and the attitude of the Amir of Bokhara is not states^hat The KaX^Bokh E re,iab,e ’ dated the 1st instant, states that the Kaghan-Bokhara line is being repaired but tha^ no reoairs have been completed on the Karshi-Termez line.

He tells me that he will not return to these districts as he cannot get on with Ebtihaj-us-Sultan. Misbah- ul-Mamalik deserves well of us as he has never taken part in intrigues against us. Sistan Affairs. Muhammad Ali Khan Kaiyani, the chief kadlhuda of Mian Kangi, has been fighting with Sardar Haji Khan Sanjarani of Siadak over a village which the Revenue Department have lately transferred to the former on contract. The Sar dar’s reputation—although his father Khan Jehan Khan was the most influential man of his time in Sistan—is falling very low, even in his own tribe, on account of his addiction to drugs and his general stupidity. News from Afghanistan. (1) See Diary No. 23 item (3). It appears that the summons to the Sardars and kadkhudas of Chakhansur at least has some connection with the case of Saiyid Kazim (see Diary No. 21), who alleges that they are all in debt to the Afghan Government. The authorities of Herat and Farah have been trying to get the Chakhansuris up to Herat, while the latter are insisting on going to Kabul. (2) It is rumoured in Birjand that cholera, and typhoid fever have appeared in Herat. (3) Several Turks are said to have arrived in Herat. , Persian raiders. A rumour has reached Sistan that a Sistani caravaru going to Kerman has been raided near Fahreh by Muhammad Mayar. This man was said last June to be an associate of Mir Muhammad Taki who was killed by Captain Kreyer’s force—- see Diary No. 25. I do not know whether the rumour refers inaccurately to Cap tain Kreyer’s engagement or whether Muhammad Mayar is continuing a career of cirme actuated partly perhaps by motives of revenge. I met Muhammad Mayar at Nasratabad Sipeh in September 1917, when he was acting as Quarantine Officer for the Kerman Government against the cholera in Sistan! F. B.

It is announced that Fakhr-ud-Dauleh has been allowed to resign his appoint ment and that Mudir-us-Saltaneh is coming from Tehran to succeed him. Our frie-nd informed the Consulate Attache on’the 19th instant that he had received a telegram from the Foreign Ministry enquiring whether it was true, as reported by the Karguzar of Turbat-i-Haidari, that a strong Afghan force was being collected on the frontier for the purpose of invading Persia. Fakhr-ud-Dauleh has replied that he knows nothing of the rumour. Two traders of suspicious antecedents, named Kerbelai Muhammad Ker- mani and Ali Agha Turk, have arrived in Sistan from Quetta. Kerbelai Muhammad was in German service at Kerman during the winter of 1915-16, but apparently is no longer. to be ready for united action and to cease from dissensions. It is alleged also to state that the Government of India have been pressing for permission to send an army through Afghanistan, which request has been refused because the Afghan Government is on friendly terms with the German and Turkish Governments. A report from Lash Juwain states that 50 Alizais are expecting an arms cara van from Kerman to come via Khabis, Chahrui and Bandan and are intending to cross the border to help the caravan through the danger zone of our cordon.

If 'T' 1 ^ i I tA*' u K T'» v- CONFIDENTIAL. 4523 1918 : Meshed Diary No. 29, for the week ending the 20th July 1918. 1. Persian officials. —Shahzadah Adal-ud-Daulah is dismissed from the Govern ment of Turbat-i-Haidari, and Salar Hashmat, the Governor General’s secretary, is appointed in his place. His Excellency assures me of this man’s complete fidelity to Himself and to us. . j 2. Early in the week I received information from His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran that intrigues had commenced which had for their object the ejection of the Kawwam-us-Saltanah and his replacement by Shahzadah Nusrat-us-Saltanah as Governor General. I communicated this personally to the Kawwam, but he did not at first attach much importance to it being apparently of opinion that the Nusrat was not a man who would ever be posted to this province : he has since, however, received a telegram himself from Tehran which has caused him to think differently, and yesterday he asked for my advice as to what he should do in the event of the intrigues proving successful. I asked what his own inclinations were, and received the reply desired and expected, viz., that he would prefer to defy Tehran if we would stand by him. I promised to refer this suggestion and to do all in my power to prevent such a calamity as another change of Government in the province so soon, prior to taking definite action on behalf of our friend himself. This appeared to us to be the best course : the Kawwam will also protest against the change on these grounds in the first instance. 3. Mirza Ahmad Ali Khan, the late Rais-i-Nazmiah, is appointed to the Govern ment of Kalat, vice Fatah-ul-Mulk, dismissed. This man was not altogether satis factory in the Police office, but we have decided to give him another chance. 4. Persian affairs (local) —The town is quiet, and the price of bread will probably remain at 3 Jcrans or a little less per man which is within reach of the maj ority of the inhabitants. The harvest is coming in, and it appears to be a sufficient one though not quite as good as was hoped at one time. There is no cholera yet. 5. Persian affairs (general). —Active measures to restore order in Khurasan continue. More men have been arrested during the week, among them some Hazara criminals who appear to have thought that I would support them and their wrong doing. The question of the Hazaras has always been difficult since the death of their Chief two years ago, and they have shewn more and more inclination to pre sume upon their relations with us as time has progressed. I have arranged with the Kawwam the limit of protection to be given to the relatives of men who have enlisted m our regular or auxiliary troops, and we have also come to an agreement regarding the relatives entitled to receive such protection. We hope that when the Hazaras understand the position they will be less unruly. 6. Shaji-us-Saltanah (paragraph 2 of Diary No. 27, etc.) reports from Sarakhs that the border is frequently raided by Turkomans. The report has also been made to the Governor General. 7. Cholera is reported to have ceased in Kuchan. The new Governor, Shah zadah Shuja-us-Sultan, has commenced action against the robber bands which, under the patronage of the late Governor, have for so long been a terror to the dis trict, more especially Bajgiran, where the Customs office has lately been closed and their work suspended on account of insecurity. 8. It is rumoured that the Governor of Astarabad, Sa’d-us-Saltanah, has been murdered by some person or persons unknown. This man was elected to the post Of Governor by the people of Astarabad : he is said to have been in league with the Janglis. 9. Secret information has been received that the Persian Government after an alleged unsuccessful attempt to obtain from the British Government through L 'enquire carefully and submit a full report. ,0.

This case gives another good example of the co-operation of the Kawwam- us-Saltanah. 19. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —The Governor has arrested one Muham mad Khan Farimani who is suspected of being concerned in the recent murder of our dak sowar. This matter is gradually coming to light we hope, but the Hazaras are still strongly suspected by many, notwithstanding the denials of Saiyid Haidar. 20. News from Herat. —The famous robber Sher Dil Yak Hast has been cap tured and blown from a gun by the orders of the Naib-ul-Hukumah. It seems that he with two companions had come secretly to Ziaratgah village and taken refuge in a certain house the owner of which gave information against them and subse quently tried to arrest Sher Dil himself and paid with his life for this precipitation being shot on the spot. The arrest was then effected by other villagers of whom three were wounded, and all who took part were suitably rewarded by the Naib. Sher Dil’s companions have been put in irons. 21. On the 10th instant the usual ceremonies connected with the Id-ul-Fitar w^ere carried out and congratulatory visits paid. 22. The immigration of large numbers of Hazaras from Persia on account of scarcity is reported. The Naib ul-Hukumah upon receiving protests that their presence in the villages would lead to increased prices announced his intention to send them all to Hazarajat. 23. The Austrians and Kazim Beg are much annoyed by extra strict regulation which have just been introduced regarding their escorts. They must now invariably be accompanied by two sepoys if they go to the town on foot, and two sowars if they ride. 24. Kazim Beg informed the Naib Salar on the 7th instant that the British troops in France continued to suffer heavy defeats, and that the Turks were marhcing from Tabriz on Tehran. I 25. On the ninth, news of the arrival of a Russian General with his family at Chihil Dukhtaran reached Herat. It is stated that these people have come to take refuge on account of some trouble in Russia and the Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered that they be received with respect and well treated pending the receipt of orders from Kabul concerning their disposal. 26. On the same day Kazim Beg stated that German troops Were marching from Askabad on Meshed, and that the British had fled to Sistan. His audience did not believe this, remarking that his information was always incorrect. 27. On the 10th a recent arrival from Bokhara was heard to say that the Amir had already enlisted 4,000 Afghans for military service in his State, and that all Afghans in Bokhara were treated with great respect and consideration. Ine speaker added that the Amir was well supplied with arms and ammunitions. 28. On the 12th instant Samandar (paragraph 22 of Diary No. 20) returned from Kabul with replies to the letters that he had brought from Herat. Samandar sent the originals to our Agent before delivering them to the German party, and copies of them have duly reached me and are under examination. Having been copied by a man who knows neither German nor English they require some decyphermg, and will be commented upon next w eek. Two in German seem to be for von Gruden, and one, in English, from the Kabul Austrian party for the Maulvi Barkat-ullah. 29 News from Turkestan and Transcaspia. —Long expected and severe fight' ing has taken place at Askabad and other places between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks who seem to be identical with the part to which the railway employes belong, and the Bolsheviks Appear to have been defeated generally. Their specia Commissioner at Askabad was among the slain. Captain Teague Jones returned from a visit to Krasnovodsk and Baku during the week. ! W. G.

The Governor of Sistan and Kainat held a reception in the morning and gave an official dinner in the evening as usual. All British Officers were present at the latter function. In Sistan the Karguzar (Acting Deputy Governor) had previously announced that no official dinner would be given on account of the distress existing over most of the country and caused by famine. At the morning Official Recep tion the Revenue Director, Ebtihaj-us-Sultan, claimed and took the first place, representing the Government, presumably in virtue of his authority extending beyond the Sistan District. News from Afghanistan. ' ’ (1) It is reported that six breech-loading guns, twelve camel loads of rifles and a large consignment of new khaki uniforms have reached Kala-i-Kang from Kandahar. (2) The Governor of Chakhansur after arresting 25 bad characters has been bribed to release them all.

(4) It is rumoured in Chakhansur that the Germans intend to construct a railway from the Russian frontier to Herat and thence to Kabul. Arms Traffic. Three Ghilzais of Chakansur and one of Sistan have brought some 30 animals —mules, horses and donkeys—into Sistan en route for Kerman, where they hope to buy rifles with the sale-proceeds of the animals. A mule in the possession of these men has been identified as one of those stolen in the Khidri robbery affair (see Diary No. 30 of 1917). The animal has been seized by the Persian author ities and the Sistani Ghilzai has been arrested. The Revenue Department in Sistan. The Director having recently ousted the Kadhhuda of Jazinak from his appoint ment, six other influential Kadhhudas have also resigned their village in protest. It seems improbable that the action of these men is intended to be treated seriously. It is said that the sons of two Kadkhudas have conspired to murder the interloping Kadkhudas of Jazinak with the assistance of three Shebak ruffians. The accused men are all to be arrested if they can be found. V F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain. G. M. Press, Simla,—No. C269 P.

Both emissaries have informed our news-writer at Awaz that three foreign officers with five servants are occupying the Kalata-i-Bihisht in Herat closely guard ed. The common people still believe that two of them are Englishmen. Sarbisheh Murder Case. A young Hazara of the Sistan Levy Corps named Taj Mahomed has confess ed to killing an old villager near Sarbisheh on June 20th. It is uncertain whether the motive of the crime was robbery or whether it arose out of a dispute. There were no eyewitnesses, but the Hazara’s foot marks have been fairly conclusively identified. The local authorities have been very quiet about the matter, only the Deputy Governor expressing to me the hope that the Hazara contingent as a whole will pay blood money on behalf of the offender as the better alternative to capital punishment.

See Diary No 23 The Governor’s arrangements for the formation of a Muni cipality have been temporarily checked owing to the lack of knowledge as to rules, etc I have learnt that the movement arose out of a report published m the news papers describing the formation of committees in Resht and other towns m the North of Persia. 150 influential Birjandis approached the Governor on the subject about 3 monthsago, their chief object being to get the control of the Nawaqil tax collec ts” and the spending of the money out of the hands of the Revenue Department. The Governor referred the proposal to the Ministry of the Interior and m due course received sanction by telegraph from Tehran to the scheme. His Excellency t en apphed to the Governor-General of Khorasan for a copy of the Ru es, having about this time been informed that his Government was replaced under the control of the Governor-General of Khorasan. The copy has now just reached His Excellency. News from Afghanistan. 1 News bas reached Birjand from Herat that large numbers of fugitives from Turkestan have entered Afghanistan. Six or seven Afghans who have served m the Tmkish Army as officers are also said to have reached Herat. The names of two are given as Sher Ahmed Khan and Bahadur Khan. 0 Qpp Dlarv No 23 The epidemic disease reported from Afghanistan has ap- narentlv died out.

Persian o&amp;cial's.—l visited the Governor Genera] on Saturday and again on Thursday. He seems to be quite himself again, and his feelings towards the extreme section of the local democrats have changed on account of their attitude in regard to Sjoeberg (paragraph 2 last week) and their general conduct while he was ill. The dismissal of the Chief of Police is decided upon, and will take place as soon as the difficulty regarding Sjoeberg’s position has been settled. 2 The Governor-General has also undertaken to dismiss the present Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari, Shahzadah Adal-ud-Daulah, who has recently been obstruc tive in various ways, notably in connection with the demand for levy sowars. Our friend the Kamal-us-Saltan, lately Kaeguztrr of Kirman.is to succeed him provided that the Foreign Office will place his services at the disposal of the Governor- General. 3 M Sioeberg wishes to serve here under the oiders of the Kawwam, but it appears that his Swedish Chief in Tehran desires that he should be under him and independent of the local authorities. The Kawwam asks for our help in arranging 5 this matter as both he and Sjoeberg wish, and I have telegraphed to Jlis Majesty’s Minister/ 4. Persian affairs\loccd).-There is again a scarcity of wheat, as the quantity which was brought from Nishapur, etc., at the time of the Kawwam s arrival is exhausted ; and barley is now issued to bakers in lieu of wheat. I have, however, a private storefor my famine relief work, having secured the consignment purchased at Bakhurz through the good offices of M. Kornehs; and amnow feeding 2,500 or g 000 people daily in an enclosed garden outside the town sufficiently far from e water stopIv mditary barracks etc. The American Mission in Tehran have placed at ow disposal the money for this work that stood at the credit of the fate Dr. Esselstyn, and I am now working for them and for ourselves m conjunc ion. 5. Three murderers were hanged by order of the Governor General on Monday last. 6 Typhus and typhoid fevers, particularly the former are still prevalent It is said^hat there is scarcely a house in the city that has not a case either of pi the other. 7 The Kawwam has received orders from Tehran to commence elections prospects of a fair election. 8 The Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Company has re-orgamsed offices in Khorassan. Three centres have been established, at Meshe , a zawar, and Turbat-i-Haffiari. Q Persian affairs teem/).—Bather better reports are received from Kuchan.

I . bsked*me what I thought, and I have not replied definitely as I prefer to wait for the return of baptain Teague Jones from Kuchan before giving an opinion. (Please see paragraph 12 last week). 10. Certain of the robbers mentioned in paragraph 7 Dabir-uT- arrested at Sabzawar, and orders have been sent to the new Governor, Dab Sultan, for their execution. 11 M Sninella the Director of Customs at Bajgiran, has arrived at lies ed. He reports that the utmost disorder prevails in the neighbourhood of his post, anmentions tlie recent appearance in Askabad of a German v Mission to establish?, commercial connections. 12. British o/faiVs-.—There was naturally some doubt at first as to how our troops would get on with the local people, more particulai ly the garrison. It is a ’satisfaction to report that the relations between all parties could not be better : we are constantly hearing complimentary remarks upon the conduct of our men, and these not always from those who share our political views. 13. Russian affairs—A telegram was received by my colleague on the 12th instant from the Russian Minister in Tehran informing him that the Caucasian Committee in Meshed had announced their intention of taking sanctuary in this Consulate General, and he was told that this “ must at all costs be prevented. 1 ’ This communication was shewn to me by Madame Nicolsky who said that her husband was too agitated to come round himself. They apparently thought that I had invited the Caucasians to take sanctuary. I assured them that there was no truth whatever in the report, which was either the result of further intrigue on the part of M. deBeauvais or impudence on that of the Turks themselves, and cordial relations are re-established to some extent. I must now shew Mir Murtaza that he must keep his premises to me or lose my good offices. 14. The prisoners Meshedi Ghulam (paragraph 14 last week) has arrived at Kain. A report has been current during the week that he had died at Turbat- i-Haidari of typhus. 15. Persian and German intrigues, —The presence of a German or Austrian who gives out that he is a convert to Islam having been reported in the house of Saiyid Riza Kuchani, I brought the mattei to the notice of the Governor General, who is making enquiries. A report of the arrival of three Turks from the Caucasus has also been received, and the particulars will be communicated to him to-day 16. The extreme democrats are reported to have appointed certain preachers for a/Ur-British preaching during the month of ifamzaw which has just commenced. One of these, in his discourse on Friday last, commented upon the punishment which the Russians had received from the patron saint of the Meshed shrine for their conduct towards it, and remarked that a similar fate would also' befall the British should they follow the example of 1912. 17. Our friend Haji Saiyid Asad-ullah has received a letter from the Janglis enclosing a copy of a proclamation believed to have been issued by the Mullas of Najaf before the British occupation of Baghdad. It is of British tendency and was signed by the Mullas on compulsion, according to our information. Further enquiries will be made regarding this document. 18. The extreme democrats have subsided, in consequence of the Kawwam’s recovery, which they honed at least might be delayed in time for another Governor General to be appointed. 19. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Rumours have been current lately that certain of the Khorassan Hazara or Barbari Chiefs had been invited by the Afghan Government to return to Afghanistan, and this morning we are definitely informed of the basis for these reports. It seems that Saiyid Haidar applied some time ago through the Nart-ul Hnkvmah of Herat for leave to return and that his appli cation was referred to Kabul. The permission has now arrived, but it is not known whether action will be taken upon it. I hope to arrange a meeting with Saiyid Haidar this week. 20 . The new Governor Jalal-us-Sultan has appointed the celebrated Mir Baki Sultan as his deputy. This is a dangerous experiment, and it will be interesting to see how it turns out. I hope soon to have a levy post at Jam which will support the Governor. 21 . News from Herat. —The Agent of the Governor of Kain (paragraph 22 last week) is reported to have brought a letter and a carp )t for the Amir of Afgha nistan, which are being despatched to Kabul by the Naib-ul-Hukumah.22. The Naib-ul-HuJcumah has ordered the despatch to Chihli Dukhturan ot forty ponies to bring a further quantity of Russian iron, which has been purchased for him by the local official. 23. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has dismissed the Agent of Hisam-ul-Mulk with a present (paragraph 21 last week), saying that the stolen property about which he had come will be handed over to the Agent of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. 24. On the first instant a Turk who was found by a servant of the Naib-ul- Hukumah begging in the bazar was placed in the stables by the Naib, in charge of the head groom, who received orders that no one was to have access to him, This man’s story is that he was employed in the Turkish army and taken prisoner by the Russians : that he escaped from confinement with 12 others of his nationality, from whom he became separated on the way to Afghanistan : and that he had been in Herat district for the past month, begging from the flock owners. He does not know what became of his comrades. 25. On the 2 nd the Agent of Shaukat-ul-Mulk (paragraph 21 above) was asked to describe the contents of the letter he was carrying for the Amir. He replied that Shaukat was trying to secure the goodwill of His Majesty as Persia was in disorder and he wished to have Afghan assistance in the event of anyone oppressing him. 26. On the 3rd Kazim Beg, having heard of the arrival of the Turk men tioned above, sent a man to the stables to bring him Bagh-i-Kartah. His mes senger, however, having first been denied entrance or information by the head groom, was snubbed by the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who said that the rumour of a Turk having come was false. 27. On the 4th Nazim Beg, during a visit to the Naib Salar, made another attempt to secure the expulsion of our Agent from Herat, saying that the British had one in Kabul, which should he enough for them. The Naib replied that it was beyond his power to eject the British Agent, and added that he was an Af ghan and a man generally respected. The Turk then remarked that it was on account of his good reputation that the Agent found it easy to get information, and the Naib made no further observation. 28,. Complaints have reached the Naib-ul-Hufaimah from the irontier Turko mans that they are much oppressed by Russians and Austrians (!) who ride about the country in motor cars and demand money from them on pain of their lives. They profess to be anxiously waiting for the arrival of Afghan troops to restore order. 29. On the 6 th the Naib-ul-Hukumah sent strict orders to the frontier officials that no foreigner sh( uld on any account be allowed to come over from Russia except under an escort. The reason of this seems to have been a report that had reached him of Kazim Beg being in the habit of communicating with Russia through Turkomans. 30. On the 7 th Maulvi Barkat-ullah gave a dinner party to Kazim Beg and the Austrians : the three latter having apparently effected a temporary reconciliation for the occasion. The reason for this hospitality is not known, but it is suggested that perhaps the Maulvi intends to leave Herat shortly. 31. News from Astarabad —Jangli intrigues among the Jafar Bai and. other Turkoman tribes are reported and it is said that some of the Kazis and elders were induced to take an oath of allegiance to the “ Unity of Islam ” movement. Five hundred sowars of the Jafar Bai and other tribes raided the Russian post at Gumbad-i-Kabus, and carried off a number of rifles. This action caused an estrangement between the Turkomans and the Jangali agents who objected to it, apparently on humanitarian grounds. Subsequently a force of 300 Bolsheviks arrived and demanded the return of the confiscated arms, but they do not yet seem to have effected this : a warning message sent to the Turkomans having been treated with disdain. » A fight is also reported to have taken place at Gumash Teppe between two sections °of the Turkomans in which a few lives were lost. Meshed ; The June 15th 1918. G. i M. Press, W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Aqent of the Government of India in Khorassan, Simla.—‘No C 252 F.D.—17-7-18—30—B.C.RCONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 25 for the week ending the 22nd June 1918. 1. Persian officials.- —Major Sjoeberg has entered upon his police duties (para graph 1 last week), the difficulties regarding him that existed having been satis factorily arranged. The Chief of Police is to be dismissed forthwith, and Abdul lah Khan, the assistant brought by Sjoeberg from Tehran, is to be appointed in his place. This I regard as an entirely satisfactory arrangement, and provided that the Governor-General maintains his present pro-ally attitude we should now be able to give enemy intrigues in Khorassan the final blow : and have little fur ther trouble until some fresh development takes place. 2 . The Foreign Office have replied to the Kawwam’s request for the services of Kamal-us-Sultan (paragraph 2 last week ) to the effect that there is no 'primd facie objection but that he should first proceed to Tehran and report him self there. In view, however, of a telegram received by me from His Majesty’s Minister suggesting that Kamal had better remain here pending further steps to arrange the matter, he will probably not go. 3. Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan, was arrested without difficulty by a party of sowars specially sent to Ku^han for the purpose by the Governor- General, and brought into Meshed on the 19th instant. Shahzadah Shuja-us- Sultan is appointed to succeed him. He has appealed to us for a promise that he shall remain in the post for six months at least, and has been informed in reply that this Governor-General is very different from his predecessor and that his permanency will depend upon good work and faithful service. 4. Tarjuman-us-Sultan, a son of Agha Sirdar Afkham, who came from Tehran with the Kawwam-us-Saltanah, has been appointed Town Governor, the position formerly held, with scant success, by Shahzadah Murtaza Mirza. This is also a good arrangement, as this man being a stranger will belong to no local party. 5. M. Kornelis is apparently suspected of embezzlement owing, no doubt, to his having abstracted from the Government funds at the time of his summary dismissal a sum equal to the amount of salary, etc., due to him for the remaining period of his contract, and having placed it to his own credit. His accounts are to be examined. 6 . Persian affairs (local). —The famine conditions are now nearly at an end. The better quality of bread is now sold at 4 krans per man, the temporary shortage of wheat having come to an end. Large numbers of people have not yet returned to work, however, and I will probably continue the relief work for another ten days or so as there are funds and the condition of the people generally is bad. During the past week the numbers fed have ranged between 3,500 and 4,000. 7 . The preacher mentioned in paragraph 16 last week has been severely re primanded by the Governor-General, and told not to mention the British in his dis courses on pain of expulsion from the city. 8 . Persian affairs (general). —Captain Teague-Jones (paragraph 9 last week) has submitted an interesting report on return from JCucha n. He found no enemy agents there nor any escaped prisoners, though some of the latter had recently passed through, as we know. He also went fully into the matter of the Russian Commercial Mission, but could discover nothing to incriminate them. It seems to be correct that they are to work in connection with the “ All-Russia Co-operative Trading Society ” of Moscow, which was established there about twelve years ago, but it is curious that so far they appear to have done nothing but hire huge premises which, in the words of Captain Jones, “ suggests their being adapted for the accommodation of troops rather than dried fruits.” The Russian agent at Kuchan, who appears to be loyal to the Allies, ridicules the idea of the Missioi* being other than genuine. They will continue to be watched.9 . Cholera having appeared at Askabad and Kirman a Sanitation Committee is being formed in Meshed under the orders of the Governor-General, who has asked me for the services of a Military Medical Officer as a member. The matter will be discussed with the Senior Medical Officer of the Eastern Persian Cordon Field Force, Major Abd-ur-Rahman, who is expected to arrive in Meshed to-morrow. 10 . On the recommendation of Captain Teague-Jones I have suggested to the Governor-General that both the Karguzar of Kuchan and his assistant should be dismissed for British proclivities, and His Excellency has telegraphed to Tehran for permission to take action accordingly. 11 . The province generally is quiet. 12 . British affairs. —The Officer Commanding our force at Khaf having arrested two suspicious Persians at his headquarters telegraphed for instructions, asking whether he should send them to Kain. I replied that I had no objection to that as they did not appear to me to require despatch to Meshed, but the Governor-General has since informed me that these men come from Kirmanshah and that he considers them highly suspicious. I have therefore asked for them to be sent in to Meshed without delay. 13. Enquiries are again being made by Tehran through the Karguzar of Meshed and his deputies as to the strength of the British troops in Khorassan and Sistan, and the amount of war material at their disposal. The object seems to be to dis cover whether the British strength is such as would warrant Persia siding with us in the event of her being obliged to take a definite position for or against us. 14. At the weekly meeting of Mullas this week many pleasant things were said of the conduct _qf our troops and our general attitude towards the people of Khorassam General satishaction with the deportations recently carried out was expressed, and a visitor from Bokhara told the company plainly that they were very fortunate to have British troops to prevent the disorders which would undoubtedly have taken place but for their presence, citing the recent attack of Bolsheviks and Turkomans upon Bokhara as an example of what might have befallen Meshed. 15. Russian affairs.—My colleague has had on]^further trouble with the Caucasian party, and this troublesome business may now be regarded as finished, though it would be better were M. de Beauvais removed from Khorassan. Bravine has recently sent telegram from Tehran recommending, ( 1 ) that all the Russian Consular officers now in Persia should be regarded as rebels against the Russian Government and treated accordingly, and ( 2 ) that all Russian tele graphists should now be withdrawn from Persia and the lines which they worked handed over to the Persian Government. 16. My colleague suggested to me on tbt 19th instant the advisability of open ing some negotiations with the Bolshevik party in Tashkent as had already been done at Resht by Bisharakov, aided by an official of the Tehran Legation, with the Bolsheviks of Baku. Then two days later I was interviewed by the representative of an Armenian association calling itself the “ Armenian Revolutionary Com mittee,” who had been sent specially to Meshad to ask for British assistance in the event of a Turko-German invasion of Transcaspia and Turkestan taking shape. The result of this interview has been referred to Tehran and India: but as the Armenian representative assured us that his party were on good terms with the Bolsheviks, and as news has arrived to-day of the outbreak of hostilities between these two parties, some further consideration of the position will be necessary before any promises can be made. - : 17. Persian and German intrigues.— The news of the route of the Jangalis and the advance of the Russian force to Resht produced an excellent effect here : the telegrams announcing the events being translated and circulated without delay' The Kawwam-us-Sultanah expressed the hope that the Jangalis would be pursued and externfinated without pity. i 18. The Governor-General has closed the caravanserai of one Meshedi Ahmad who was reported to him by us as being in the habit of entertaining Turkish refugees. He has also taken action on other reports that we have made to him of a similar nature, and has given further proof that he is working with us 1p atte? Field otj* Id lie ‘estei ^4?

News from Turkestan and Transcaspia.-Om Agent at Daraiaiz has iust returned from another visit to Askabad. He reports that the condition of the town is bad. Wheat bread can scarcely be got, and the common food is a form of barley bread which is almost uneatable Disturbances are rife, and people dare not go out after dark. The Agent heard while at Askabad that the Turkish Troops were two stages only from Baku : and that the Armenians at Baku had unsuccessfully tried to t make peace with the Turks and Tartars. Information published in Baku newspapers of the 31st May is that the Trans- Caucasion Government has ceased to exist: Georgia has declared herself to be an m ependent democratic republic : and a German commercial institute is being es a Turkey is preparing to annex certain provinces, and de mands that she should ha,ve at her disposal for the period of the present war all Irans-Caucasian railway lines and that the populace should feed her troops passing through en route tor the Caspian. Meshed : The, 22nd June 1918, W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, ' 7 : 90^ lief; dAy- r - v 'nib* tL M. Press, Simla.—Nd. Cs 266 F;D.—22-7-18^-30—M.B.ttCONFIDENTIAL Meshed Diary No. 26, for the week ending the 29th June 1918. 1 . Persian officials.— Chief of Police has been dismissed and Abdullah Khan appointed in his place (paragraph 1 , last week). 2 . Shaji-us-Saltanah, our Jam friend, has been posted as Governor of Sarakhs and recognised as the Chief of his section of the Taimuri tribe. The-Sarakhs appoint ment is an important one in view of its frontier connections, and Shaji should be useful to us there. 3. Shuja-ud-Daulah (paragraph 3, last week) is still in confinement, and the charges against him are under enquiry. We have referred to the Governor Genera] the question of the payment of the balance of his debt to the Imperial Bank, and His Excellency has promised to have it settled. We have obtained and handed to the local authorities a list of arms in possession of the Kuchanis, and steps will' be taken to confiscate and distribute these among the Meshed regular troops, who are badly in want of suitable armament. 4 . Persian affairs (local ).—Our famine relief work continues, and the numbers mentioned last week have been maintained notwithstanding the fall in the price of bread. The chief reason for this is the fact that large numbers of people are scill unemployed, the carpet and other industries not having yet commenced to recover from the depression produced by famine conditions. 5. The preacher mentioned in paragraph 7 last week has again given trouble, though not to us, having again been warned by the Governor General for veiled attack upon the people who sell us grain for the troops. He has now turned his attention to the affairs of the Shrine, which still afford ample scope for criticism. 6 . The Kawwam-us-Saltanah has postponed the elections for the proposed Meshed Municipality in addition to those for the National Assembly, and for the same reason (paragraph 7 of Diary No. 24). 7 . A well known Taimuri brigand was executed in the Nazmiah on the 25th instant by order of the Governor General. 8 . Cholera is reported from various villages and a Sanitary Commission has been formed in Meshed under the presidency of the Amir Alam and with Cap tain Sinton, V.C., I.M.S., and Dr. Chiriayeff, the Medical Officer attached to the Russian Consulate General, as members. Quarantine stations have already been established, and other serious steps are being taken to combat the disease on its arrival in the city. 9 . Persian affairs (general). —A report of the appearance of cholera at Kuchan has just been received. 10. Telegraphic communication with Resht has been restored. 11 . British affairs. —News of the defeat of the Janglis has been fully circulated in Persian and French and has produced an excellent local effect. A similar effect has been produced by telegrams from Baghdad Mullas and others praising British arrangements and care for Shrines, etc. 12. About four lakhs of rupees have to be added to the sum mentioned in paragraph 10 of Diary No. 23 as value of goods imported into Khorasan from India during the month of Saur ( 21 st April to 21 st May). The Sistan returns were received very late this rponth. 13. Sulaiman Danielzadalj, a Daghistani ez-Turkish officer who had been in Meshedl for some days staying in the caravanserai or mihmankhanah of one Meshedil Muhammad, a Caucasian Turk, came to us on the night of the 26th instant with a letter addressed to Colonel Pike which he said he had been directedMm to deliver by the Legation at Tehran, with whom he had taken service on deser tion from the ranks of the Turks. His story was that he could not get through, nor could he return to Tehran by any other route than that of Kahka Meshed. A reference has been made to Tehran, and the man’s papers are under exami nation by the General Staff Branch. The Governor General, who has already closed one caravanserai which fell under suspicion, will be asked to deal simi larly with this one in the event of a case being made out against the owner. 14. Major Abd-ur-Rahman arrived at Meshed on the 22 nd and left on the 27th. He and 1 called on the Governor General on the 25th, and discussed with him the preventive arrangements to be made in regard to cholera (paragraph 8 above). 15. Russian affairs .—My colleague has had no further trouble with his Caucasians. Madame de Beauvais has been suffering from typhus fever at Turbat-i-Haidari, and her life was probably saved by the attentions of Major Abdur-Rahman, who happened to be at Turbat when the disease was at its worst. 16. Persian and German intrigues .—On the 25th instant, Abdul Jawad, a brother of the pro-Turk inspector of democrat societies who was recently de ported from Meshed, was heard to exhort some young Caucasians in the Shrine to opposition to the British, who, he said, had bombarded the Shrine of Najaf and hanged Agha Saiyid Ali Mujtahid. One of his audience who had recently come from Baku rebuked the speaker and he found no sympathy. In response to a request from His Majesty’s Minister we have caused the Mullas, democrat society, and the society of patriots or ‘ ‘ trouble bearers ’ ’ to send telegrams to Tehran in support of a demonstration which is in progress in Tehran in favour of the candidature of our friend the Vasuk-ud-Daulah for the office of President of the Council. The readiness of the democrats to join in this move ment may be attributed to the fact that the majority of their brethren in Tehran are participating in the demonstration, and also no doubt to the relationship of the Yasuk to our Governor General. The general situation in Meshed remains favourable to us, and the Kawwam’s personal relations with us are daily becoming more cordial with increased know ledge and mutual confidence. 17. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. of fever, but is now convalescent. -Our agent has suffered from a severe attack 18. The question of the change of Governor is not yet settled. The Kamal- us-Sultan is a little too pro-British for the democrats, reformed though they be, and the proposal to appoint him is receiving some opposition at their hands. The Kawwam will not, however, be influenced by that, and the Kamal has not yet left as there is hope that his appointment will be arranged shortly. 19. News from Turbat-Shaikh J ,m. —Habib-ullah Khan, brother of the Tai- muri Chief Shaji-us-Sultanah, has arrived at Jam to Jook after the property of Shaji and himself, the former having been posted as Governor of Sarakhs (para graph 2 above). 20 . News from Karaiz. —The arrival by caravan of a Turk deported from -Herat by the Naib-ul-Hukumah is reported. He gives his name as Jurah Beg, son of Sikundar Beg : and says that his age is 35. His story is that he was employed in the Turkish Air Service, and was forced to descend in Russian territory while on a raiding expedition : that he was taken prisoner and detained in Khokand, Merv, and Tashkent: that he with five other prisoners escaped from confinement and after several adventures arrived at Herat alone. This appears to be the man mentioned in paragraph 22 last week who was to have been deported by the Naib-ul-Hukumah of Herat. 21 . News from Herat. —The Agent of the Governor of Kainat, Muhammad Ali Beg, has left Herat, some of the stolen property having been haiided over to him (paragraph 21 of Dairy No. 24). This is said to include mules, turquoises, and a rifle which our Agent thinks may be that stolen from Major Thorburn some two years age.n ausedlt ’ to seEA inlelm i office ol i move- .n Tekac onsliji cl midi edloioi- e Kail- ttey te, ods, Ttf t yet left \ 22 . The Xaib-ul HuJcumah has despatched to Kabul 26 lakhs of Jcrans under an escort of 50 sowars. , r ^' ' Vlx hharvars and forty mans of iron have been brought into the foundry at Herat from Chihil Dukhturan. J 24. A camera was brought into the Naib-ul-Huhumah on the 18th instant by a villager, who had found it in Jalalabad village about a mile from Herat. The Naib having found on enquiry that it did not belong to any of the town photo graphers sent it to von Gruden, but he did not claim to be the owner. It is now with Kazim Beg, who is making enquiries as to its antecedents. 25. On the 16th the ISaib Solar received a visit from Kazim Beg, who explain ed to him the dispositions to be made by the German and Turkish troops on their approaching visit to Afghanistan and Persia. He said that one party would pro ceed to Sistan md Meshed: another to Quetta via Herat and Kandahar • and the third to Peshawar via Turkistan and Kabul. He stated, moreover, that the troops destined for Peshawar were to be all Turks: as the Turkish Government had already arranged with the frontier tribes that they would join this force on its arrival in their vicinity. 26. Two of von Gruden’s servants were absent from Bagh-i-Kartah on the night of the 17th. The Naib Solar has ordered a secret enquiry to be made into the cause of their absence. / Yon Gruden wished to dismiss the offenders from his service, but Kazim Beg restrained him, pointing out that they might then go and enter the service of the British, subsequently giving away their secrets to them. 27. On the 20 th the Naib-ul-Hukumah released two Kainis whom he had imprisoned on a representation by Kazim Beg that they were the spies of the British Agent. 1 28. Newsfrom Turkestan and Transcaspia. —A news agent reports to our Agent at Herat that he Amir of Bokhara is still enlisting Afghans: and another states that the Bussians have cleared out the Bokhara treasury. Our Agent at Darajaiz reports that a conflict took place at Askabad on the 17th between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in which there were 50 casualties. The Turks have not yet occupied Baku. / t ,M / Meshed : \ W, G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, The 29th June 1918. ) His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan.CONFIDENTIAL. I Meshed Diary No. 27, for the week ending the 6th July 1918. / 1 . Persian officials. —The attitude of His Excellency the Governor General remains friendly in the extreme. I have referred to him during the week certain matters concerning democrat intrigues, notably the recall to Tehran by telegram of the Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah, the leader of the cm£i-democrat society known as the Ranjbaran , and he has dealt with them according to my suggestions without hesitation : having, for example, telegraphed at once to Tehran asking that the Ma’tamid should not be transferred. 2 . Shaji-us-Saltanah left during the week to take up his appointment as Governor of Sarakhs (paragraph 2 last week). 3. Shahzadah Shuja-us-Sultan (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 25) also left for Kuchan, having paid me a cordial visit of farewell during which he asked me to let him know at once in case we required anything done. He has promised to keep an eye on the Russian “ commercial mission ”, regarding whom, however, the latest reports are more re-assuring. A small force has been despatched to Kuchan by the Governor General with orders to capture and bring in certain robbers, and to confiscate the arms spoken of in paragraph 3 last week. 4. Persian affairs (local). —The famine relief work is now nearly at an end. The superior class of bread is now purchasable at 3 krans per man, and our num bers have fallen to 3,000 or so daily. We propose to discontinue relief measures from the first of the next Muhammadan month. 5. The notorious ruffian Ibrahimzadah who was concerned in the murder of the Rais-i-Nazmiah in May last year : the attack upon the house of the Najd-us-Sal- tanah in November last: and various movements of a more or less cm/i-British nature within the last two years, was executed by order of the Governor General on the 1 st instant. 6 . The preacher mentioned in paragraph 5 last week and previous reports has at last yielded to the advice of the Governor General. His last address contained a favourable reference to the conduct of our troops in Meshed and other remarks complimentary to ourselves. The secret meeting of Mullas held during the past week was also marked by cordial references to British policy and treatment of alien religions, and much was said in condemnation of the Germans and German methods of dealing with subject races. 7. The Karguzar of Meshed, in reply to a telegram from the Foreign Office enquiring into the subject of military preparations which are taking place in Afghanistan, gives an explanation which coincides almost exactly with our own information. He says that the Amir is merely preparing for the possibility of an attack by one or more of the belligerent Powers upon his territories, and adds that he may possibly desire to assist the Amir of Bokhara. 8 . Cholera has not yet appeared in Meshed though the report of its exist ence at Kuchan ^confirmed, and it has advanced some distance in this direction. I have telegraphed to India for a large amount of serum for inoculation, and we are also trying to obtain some from Askabad where there is said to be a large quantity available. Frequent meetings of the Sanitary Commission take place, but Captain Sinton is rather in despair as there seems to be nothing to be done regarding the protection of the water supply. Typhus and typhoid fevers are still rife in the town and there are cases of both among the troops : while two more men of my escort are suffering from the former disease, though fortunately each has a mild attack. There is also much relapsing fever both among the troops and the populace, and yesterday a case of small-pox - was reported in the 19th Punjabis. Several cases of glanders have occurred among the horses of the 28th Light Cavalry. 9. Persian affairs, (general). The Governor-General has received a telegram from the people of Kuchan thanking him for having ejected Sfiuja-ud-Daulah paragraph 3 last week) from the post of Governor.10 . In addition to Kuchan, cholera is moderately severe in Darajaiz and its neighbourhood. So far as can be ascertained, however, it does not seem to be of a more virulent type than that of last year. 11 . British affairs. —The Governor-General asked me, at an interview on the 3 rd instant, to give him a statement of the number and dispositions oi British troops in Khorasan and Sistan. His object in desiring this information is, not an unfriendly one : he merely wishes to know what our strength is in the various portions of his domain. Great interest is taken by the Foreign Office in Tehran m our forces, and particularly in their supplies of war material: several telegrams having recently been received by the Karguzar enquiring into the amount of mate rial carried by certain convoys, etc. 12 . Russian affairs. —It is reported that goods are now to be exported to Bussian territory from Bajgiran, but no permission is yet given for import into Persia. An order has been passed prohibiting the entry of armed Armenians into Persia: such persons are in future to leave their arms at the frontier Customs posts. The same rule is apparently to apply to Russians, as within the last few days some Russian officers (three of those mentioned in paragraph 11 of Diary No. 3 who were returning to IVIeshed) were held up at Khakistar by the Customs authorities who demanded their arms. The officers declined to surrender them, and arrived armed in Meshed in due course. 13. The relations between my colleague and the Caucasian community have improved : the former having taken my advice regarding the treatment to be accorded to the latter by the Consulate. Madame de Beauvais (paragaph 15 last week) is better, and her husband has made no further trouble recently. 14. The democrats of Kuchan have made a strong complaint to their brethren in Meshed against the Russian Bank Manager and Political Agent in that town. Their complaint appears, however, to have no political ground : and is said to be caused chiefly by the extortion practised by his munshi, Meshedi Mirza. 15. Persian and German intrigues. —Two meetings of democrats were held this week as usual. At the first much regret was expressed at the attitude of the new Governor-General who, so it was said, had before leaving Tehran promised faithfully to work with and for the society, but had actually allied himself to the British and was entirely at their service. The question of the Municipal elections was then re-discussed, and finally that of quarantine against cholera was dealt with : a recommendation for money to be placed at the disposal of Amir Alam the president of the Sanitary Commission, being proposed and carried. At the second meeting the condition of affairs in Tehran, the Cabinet, etc., was the object of discussion. Tnis was followed by references to the dismissal of Shuja-ud-Daulah from the Government of KuOhan : the hope being expressed that we would not make the man’s debt to the Imperial Bank a reason for his reinstal lation. After this some unimportant letters from frontier stations were read and commented upon. There is now an air of depression in demorcrat circles. 16. The Karguzar has received a secret telegram from the Foreign Office in forming him of the probable arrival at Meshed of a Turk named Shaikh Muhammad Ali with two other persons (nationality not stated) named Akbar’and Naki and directing him to communicate to Tehran all particulars regarding their actions in Meshed. A watch wilFbe kept for these men. 17. M. Sjoeberg, the newly arrived Chief of Police has been suffering from fever for several days, and the opportunity has been taken by the democrats to intrigue against his assistant, Abdullah Khan (paragraph 1 last week). The person employed by them as their tool has however denounced the manoeuvre to us, and nothing has resulted. 18. News from Herat. —The Naib-ul-Hukumah has recently issued strict orders regarding the inspection of caravans entering and leaving Afghanistan, evidently with a view to a more careful watch upon the movements of foreigners. 19. A report has been received by the Naib-ul-Hukumah that a merchant of Anar Darrah has been convicted of attempting to smuggle in some arms from Persia. IpHe seems to raise no objection : merely asking that the man and arms be sent in to him tor enquiry. 20. The harvest in the Maimanah district is reported to be bad, and famine conditions are expected to continue over this year. , . f 21 ; ^ Naib-ul-Hukumah has replied to a request made bv certain Barbari whenever they ptee t0 Af g hanistan that tte y at liberty to return u 2 h , V0n ® rU f e “ stated °“ the 23rd June that 30 Russians had recently come to Kabul via Turkistan to make some agreement with the Amir. He add»d that his compatriots at Kabul had not yet discovered the nature of this agreement but that a report upon it from them would follow later. (Our Agent remarks that as no post had reached Herat from Kabul for a day or two much rehance cannot be placed on this information.) * reliance . „ 23 ; V ri G f d v n reC f Ved ° n the 24th idem a letter from Samandar, his mes- 59 of T)° ka M Ul on 0 I !i a 80 a . secret a g ent of our Herat representative (paragraph 22 of Diary No. 20 and previous reports). It reported his safe arrival at Kabul after many difficulties, including attacks by robbers, on the way, and the success ful delivery of the letters entrusted to him to the consignees. We hope to hear more of this matter later. 24 - Kazim Be g’ s man Haji Ahmad was sitting in front of a shop in the bazar talking when a passer-by stopped to hear his discourse. The Haii had him arrested as a spy of the British, but the Naib-ul-Hukumah hearing of the occur- rence at once ordered his release. 25. Nasmllah,was heard to say on the 26th that a German army was shortly to arrive at Dahana-i-Zulfikar via Russia,, and that orders had been issued to the Herat foundry for the preparation of 10,000 shoes for their horses. Our Agent took the trouble to enquire into this, and says that there is no truth in the report of such an order having been given. r 26. Kazim Beg says that the camera found in Jalalabad (paragraph 24 last week) must have fallen from an aeroplane. 27. Kaka Shirazi, the cook of the German party, prepared cakes on the 27th June which he said were required for a journey, but upon being cross-examined regarding the journey declined to give further information. On the following day the cook’s assistant left Herat’, it is not known where he is gone. 28. Kazim Beg and the other Muhammadans connected with the Bagh-i- Kartha have again been abused for not keeping fast as they were last year during the month of Ramzan. . ° 29. News from Turkistan and Transcaspia. —The following is taken from a report received from Mahmudabad, near Askabad. The Askabad Bolsheviks have called up the male population from 21 to 35 years of age to fight the Cossacks. The populace, however, are willing to fight against Germans or Turks, but not against the Cossacks: they are disgusted with the Bolsheviks who waste money which is not legally their own on drink etc. Attempts made by the Bolsheviks to disarm the Armenians have not been succes- ful. Askabad is suffering from visitations of typhus, typhoid, and other fevers in addition to famine ; and now cholera has made its appearance, ten persons having died from it on the 8 th instant ( 21 st June). W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General cmd Agent of the Government of India in Khorassm. Meshed, The 6th July, 1918. G. M. Frees, Simla.—No. C296FD—2-8-18—30—B.C.R.TTim* , &gt;1 officials —On the night of the 6 th instant Captain Sinton, V.C cfJZ} aS attended the Ark and inoculated the Governor- eral and the principal local officials against cholera, at the request of the former n-nA L Saiy t d ^ 1 ulian if ? d ’ th ? 1 1 ocal Excise Officer, has again been called to Tehran and leaves shortly. It is said that his services are urgently required elsewhere There is some doubt as to this man’s political views. He represents himself such 1 but report^o^ffis f^ Ka ^ m ;) 1S ' Saltanal1 P rofes ses to believe in him as + f h b n re P orts of friendship with the extreme democrat partv are too persis- tent to be ignored. I have, however, no clear evidence of his having actively assisted m opposition to us. g acnveiy 3. Persian atfairs (local).-The Governor-General has commenced active measures against those m whose houses raided property is believed to be stored tbe^ 6 tV S p St6P rig u dn ’ ection re q ui res the utmost caution. During the past week he has arrested one Haji Ata Muhammad Kandahari, and confiscated his property on a charge of having received the result of raids committed bv his son-in-law upon Barbans and Taramris. He has also arrested Ahmad Ali a Barban, who is suspcted of having been concerned in recent raiding, and has confis- ted animals and other property found in his possession. As a result of these measures, and the general attitude of the Kawwam towards crime and criminals, some teelmg against him was shewn at a secret meeting held in the house of one Abdul i, an arms merchant: at which the execution of Ibrahimzadah (paragraph s last week) was condemned and the suggestion made that as the Kawwam had exe cuted this man without trial his own life should be taken in retaliation. The police having heard of this meeting, arrested Abdul Ali, who is now in the Nazmiah prison.’ ( 4. Shaikh Inayat-ullah, the preacher mentioned in paragraph 6 last week again referred favourably to us in his sermon this week ; expressing regret for having accused us of buying up gram in advance in order to increase local sufferino- which he now knew to be quite false, and praising our treatment of the Meshed public. He announced the intention of speaking well of us wherever he went. EPo J era Eas n °t y e t appeared here, and the latest reports suggest that it has ceased at Kuchan. There have also been no fresh cases at Chinaran where the quarantine is apparently being conducted with more care and thoroughness than are generally displayed by Persians. 6 . Yet another secret society has been founded in the city known as the ‘ In a yah or those who wish to return to a former condition of affairs. They may.also be described as Anglophile ; as in their meeting this week general condemnation of Persian misrule was expressed with the hope that the British would soon release Persia from the tyranny of her own people, as they had done in India. 7. Persian affairs (general).—Cholera is also reported to have ceased at Darajaiz, but there are still occasional cases in the neighbouring villages. 8 . It is reported from Nishapur that a gang of robbers from the village of Kharv and its neighbourhood have raided the hamlet of Sama, carrying off considerable property The Governor Fatih-us-Saltanah, a grandson of the late Prince Naiyir- ud-I^uiah is m Meshed, and his deputy is said to be* in league with the thieves and has naturally taken no steps to deal with them. « nr 9 f r^ dl ; stu / pance 18 reported from Kuchan apparently raised by a sympathiser with the late Governor, Shuja-ud-Daulah. The sowars of the Governor-General i led one of the gang, arrested three others, and confiscated nine rifles. t i, 10 ‘ British affairs.—The Central Committee of the Union and Progress at e ran have telegraphed to their branch in Meshed enquiring into the conduct of our troops here. They have received the reply that it could not be better.'T' * ^ 11 Our famine relief work has ceased from the 11 th instant. It has been most successful andhas no doubt saved numbers of lives. The joint arrangements made successful ana na p bvterian Mission have throughout worked extremely weir iTtfhavrcSbuShe greater part of the fundsVe have supplied the labour and^for most of the time, the ground for the bread distribution. The price of bread having now fallen permanently it is hoped that many of the peopl who have been for so long out of work will now find smtable employment. 12 A communication has been received in Meshed from a Mulla of Resht describing the arrangements made by the B-tish on thmr arnval, and expressing the relief of the populace at the disappearance of the Janglis. 13 In connection with events in Transcaspia and Turkestan it was desired to I , , ., ... , ( _- m Mp,hed to Muhammadabad near the frontier despatch a force of British troops from Mesnea ro iuuu Political at Lutfabad, and it was proposed to send Captain A. Sa 1 aiid Intelligence Officer. The scheme has, however, been postponed tor some days^ 14. There is now a general decrease in the sickness reported last week, both among onr troops and the public. _ at j ,i ,,ii p 15. Some 250 men of the 19th Punjabis arrived at Meshed on the 11 th from Turbat-i-Haidari under the command of Captain Pigo . ^ (; Ifi Russian affairs .—The Russian firm of Yakubi Zurgagen having failed to discharge a debt to the Imperial Bank of Persia which has been owing now for nearlv a year I have, with the sanction of His Majesty s Ministo m Tehran, , written to mv colleague (who has also failed to arrange the matter) nforming him She fiJmust ply in three days or have a portmn of them w~l appropriated and sold for the purpose of payment to the Bank of the sum due. My co eauge has replied that he cannot order the firm to pay, but proposes to proceed with the matter ud cial y Steps will be taken within the next few days to carry out the course Sated! Is the Bank cannot, in view of the present heavy military expenditure, afford to wait indefinitely for their money. 17 The police raided the house of a prominent Caucasian Turk during the week, and discovered that a gambling party was being held on the premises. The owner and several guests were summoned and fined. 18 M. Nicolsky has complained to the Governor-General that the Karguzar does nothing for him, and the Karguzar, whose relations with M. Kaal who suc ceeded M de Beauvais as First Secretary have never been satisfactory, has made counter-complaints against M. Kail. It is desirable that this Karguzar should be relieved of his appointment as he requires change of air thoroughly to recover from his recent very severe illness. I have therefore telegraphed to His Majesty s Minister recommending his replacement by Kamal-us-Saltan, the late Karguzar of Kirman. 19 The trouble with the Caucasians has evidently ceased : as they are now frequenting the Consulate as formerly.’ Madame de Beauvais is reported to be convalescent (paragraph 13 last week). 20 Persian and German intrigues. —A letter from the firm of Takioff has been received by one Meshedi Akbar Karabaghi in which the addressee is asked to furnish particulars regarding the strength of the British troops m Khorassan. This firm, which is established at Baku, is known to be ^o-Turk, and the ob]ect is clear. 21 . The local democrats are quiet. They have received very plain instructions from the Kawwam regarding the attitude they should adopt towards us, and the maiodty will be wise enough to act accordingly. Also the successes m Italy : complete defeat of the Janglis : and better news from the western front: have had their effect. 22. News from Herat.—The Naib-ul-Hukumah has forbidden women 4 to frequent the Herat shrines in future. 23 Kazim Beg received a letter on the 29th ultimo which had been brought tn him from Russia’by a Turkoman sowar. The contents are not yet known, but later on the same day Kazim visited the Naib Salar and informed him that Mohendra Pertab who had been to Berlin via Russia, was now returning to Afghanistan with an important communication for the Amir from the German Emperor.4 / \ iduiafftlt mises. lit \ 24. The father of the guide Faiz-ullah has recently been arrested by the Customs authorities, presumably at Karaiz, for smuggling opium. Faiz-ullah, who went to enquire, states that his father was released, one pot of opium being confiscated, and that he got away safely with another pot which, however, contained letters for Meshed. He will shortly return from Meshed. 25. The Naib-ul-Hukumah visited Kazim Beg and the Maulvi Barkat-ullah at the Bagh-i-Kartah. In the course of conversation Kazim informed the Naib that France had made with Germany, without the knowledge of the British, an agreement for the exchange of prisoners of war ; and that the British were very much displeased and had become suspicious of their Ally. 16. The Indian doctor has failed to obtain the consent of the Naib Salar to the grant of leave to his assistant, who wished to go to Kabul to see his family. The Naib gave as a reason for refusing the leave that German troops had arrived on the Afghan frontier, and that he could not give leave at such a time. ( He had heard this news from the servants of the German party, who had pub lished it in the bazar the previous day. 27 The Naib-uI-Hukuma'h has also postponed the departure of his own family from Kabul; apparently for fear of a Turko-German invasion of Afghanistan en route to India. 28. Masons have been ordered to build two guard houses on the west and east sides of the garden of Bagh-i-Kartah. The object is said to be to prevent any person climbing over the walls. 29. News from Turkistan and Transcas'pia .—There are rumours of Bolshevik defeats and of the arrival of Cossack detachments at Askabad, but though there is probably some truth in them it is impossible to give details at this stage. Meshed : W. G. GBEY, Lieutenant-Colonel, The 13th July 1918. His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan, le Kai$raSECRET. Intelligence Summary Number 22 for tlie week ending the 1st June 1918. Khorasan and North East Persia. 172. British Lieutenant Gatehouse, 58th Light Cavalry, reached Meshed during the week. Captain Teague-Jones and Lieutenant Ward arrived on the 31st May. Captain, Sinton, V.C.,1. M.S., leaves for Turbat-i-Haidari on temporary duty. 173. Kuchan .—The German prisoners reaching Kuchan on the 22nd ultimo are now reported to be 3 not 2. One of them arrived disguised as a Caucasian Turk. The following day 5 Austrians arrived. These men asked for Kbabat of the Commercial Mission by name (This is the second report of such an occurrence). Two more suspicious persons subsequently arrived; one dressed as a Caucasian and carrying a German rifle, the other in European dress and a helmet. The 5 Austrians are said to have left but their destination is not yet known. Khabat and Vaksiu of the Commercial Mission come and go. Thev are repairing the caravansarai of Abul Hassan which they have hired, and repaving the stones in it. Several of these measure 52 yards by 15. Commer- cialists at Kuchan consider them more suspicious that ever, although they cannot as yet give chapter and verse. One reliable informant opines that if they are merchants they are in the employ of German firms and are working for German interests. Shujah-ud-Daulah has punished one Hajji Mahmud Hussain and extracted 500 tomans from him stating that his offence was selling grain to the British. 174. Sabzwar.—^ Austrian prisoners reached Sabzwaron the 27th instant from the direction of Kuchan. 175. Shahrud .—An agent who has just returned from Shahrud states that a German officer, 3 Austrians and 12 Turks were present there on the 20th instant. The German was suffering from a severe attack of fever; the party were camped in the garden of a tea-house, but received food from the Governor. In conversation the Turks displayed considerable curiosity as to roads leading to the Afghan border, so much so that the agent concluded, that they had the intention of proceeding in that direction. No telegram noting departure has so far been received from agent stationed there. The Shahrud population are reported to be supplying the Jangalis in the direction of- Astrabad with arms, ammunition and supplies. The majority of them openly look forward to the coming of the Turks. 176. Semnan. —A report dated the 22nd ultimo states that a party of JangaB savars had arrived from the direction of Jandak (?); they gave no trouble to the inhabitants but were in communication with the revenue officials, the police, and the gendarmerie. The latter, especially, are reported to assist enemy prison ers with money and guides. (Reports received re Jangalis during the week are at present too indefinite for reproduction). 177. Local affairs .—The Governor-General is unfortunately somewhat severely ill. A raid carried out by his orders on a house in which Turkish agents were reported produced no results. As the affair was conducted by the Chief of the Police, whose pro-Turkish and democratic sympathies are notorious, this is perhaps hardly surprising. We have, so far, not succeeded in laying hands on these gentry. More escaped Turkish prisoners— -3 I believe—have been sent in from Daragiz and are with the remainder in the Ark.A Swedish officer (Stmlbers ?) has arrived froni Tehran for police duties. The democrats are apparently desirous of confining his energies to the Amnieh department and of leaving the Nazmieh or police proper in the hands of the present incumbent. (fj* Enemy agents. —The departure from Tehran for Meshed of the following is reported: — 1. German Lieutenant Hauk. Short and very fair. 2. German Petzold. Short and stout. 3. Hartviger. Austrian or Bussian subject. 27 years old, tall, thin dark hair and moustache. Speaks Persian and Turkish. May have gone to Mazan-daran. Herat and Afghanistan. 178. Germans and adherents.—Ornden and his servant returned to the Bagh-i-Kart;ih, being discovered by the guard in the act of scaling the wall by night. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has directed that they are to be accompanied in future on their expeditions. Gruden has stated that both Wagner and Paschen were in Russia, and would shortly arrive at Herat on important business. (According to latest information here Wagner was making a stay at Tehran. Pascben was confined at Tiflis prison but no doubt his enlargement was one of the bye-products of the Russian revolution.) The Naib-ul-Hukumah displayed some scepticism at Kazim Beg’s assur ance that by now the whole of Prance was in German hands. Reports of Rus sian disorders constituted a lesser strain on his credulity. Prom the same source it was reported that a Turkish officer of^ high rank is among the Turkomans. This is far from improbable, and may refer to some of the Turkish agents of whom we have already heard. 179. MilHary preparations. —Up to the 23rd ultimo the hasht con scription inthe Herat district had yielded some 1,700 recruits, (reference para graph 150). This is not far from making good the deficiences in the garrison reported at the beginning of April (paragraph 104). The conscription has been applied to Sayyids and Khojas who protested to the Naib-ul-Hukumah against this unwelcome innovation. He replied that this was the affair of the Naib-Salar, but that the ready supply of numerous and strong recruits would enable him to intercede on behalf of the protesting classes who were apparently eom- peded to rest content with this modicum of comfort. The Naib-Salar has inspected recruits obtained. The Officer Commanding, Artillery, has been directed to detail jamadars and havildars for instruction in shell-filling, in order that they may impart the process to their men. 180. Frontier. —Rissaldar Yar Muhammad returned from the Chihildukh- taran frontier for instructions. He reported the desire of Turkomans from Russia for land to cultivate, and was told to await an answer from Kabul. Tue question of the replacement of ruined boundary pillars on the Anar- darrah frontier has been referred to Kabul. 181. Forage. —Lucerne seeds have been issued to the districts from Herat store with orders for cultivation, and subsequent drying and storing of crops produced. 182. Mohendro Pur/cp.—-With reference to previous reports of this indi vidual’s return to Afghanistan, of which confirmation has not been received, certain Shikarpuri Indian traders from Bokhara state that they well recall his passage through Bokhara to Tashkent in February and wished to visit him but found that he had left. They are confident that he bad not passed through Bokhara on a return journey to Afghanistan, and when recently at Tashkent they were unable to learn anything of his recent presence in that town,Russian Tuekistan. 183. Current events. —Considerable tension exists throughout Turkistan where the main interest centres in Caucasian affairs and their probable effect on Turkistan and its inhabitants; the situation in Bokhara has not, however, ceased to inspire uneasiness. Unfortunately reliable news from Baku of the latest turn of affairs is scanty. Both Bolsheviks and Armenians are neverthe less facing the possibility of a Turkish movement to Turkistan, and it is probable that the haste which the Bolsheviks are displaying in enrolling all and sundry in the Red Guards—Persians even being included—is connected with appre hensions for the future. I have excellent reasons for knowing that the Arme nians are in particular exceedingly anxious. With a very real danger at their very door it is strange to discover that the Bolsheviks are apparently frighten ing themselves with the bogey of an Anglo-Afghan invasion. There is, however, little doubt that such is the case, and in a speech at Tashkent Kolesov, the chief Bolshevik Commissary, stated that he had information that the English were pushing on a railway through Afghanistan with a view to the occupation of Turkistan by Afghan assistance, and that be had in consequence been compelled to secure the Afghan frontier garrisons. An aerodrome has been recommenced at Tashkent and the arrival of aviators and machines from Russia is reported in connection with the above. The speech and the consequent action may be susceptible of some recondite explanation ; it is, however, diffi cult to imagine its nature and there seems no good ground for refusing to accept the explanation given. The existence of such an idea is unfortunate at the moment when the Bolsheviks appear to have made up their mind to resist the Turko*German; any preparations which it may invoke are, however, all to the good. Six days after granting the Amir of Bokhara the 12 days* grace he had asked for the Bolsheviks again presented an ultimatum reiterating their demand for the surrender of his principal advisers, disarmament, and the grant of a liberal constitution. The Amir was apparently able to make good bis protest at the Bolsheviks infringement of their promise, and they shortly after with drew their main force towards Tashkent, leaving the Amir a free hand of which he took ample advantage—in dealing with the main thorns in bis flesh, the Society of Union and Progress. Not a few of these appear to have lost their lives. The influx of Afghans for enlistment is said to have continued. Inci dentally the Amir and his advisers appear to stand in considerable awe of their Afghan supporters ; an effort to dismiss them a short time ago met with no success, and their arrogant conduct at Bokhara causes general alarm. At Samarkand, also, much unrest is reported. The Bolsheviks have raised the amount of the pecuniary contribution originally demanded, but are not pressing it with their original insistence. Native mujahaddin are stated to have been secretly enrolled and to await a chance of rising should Bokharan events offer a favourable opening. In such an event the attitude of natives enlisted in the Red Guards would be problematical. Ten millions are reported to have reached Bokhara from Tashkent for payment of compensation to foreigners, and Russians and Armenians to ha^e been so far the only beneficiaries. The Amir would presumably foot the hill in the end. Rumours of Afghan assistance in the event of a rising at Bokhara or Samarkand are prevalent. The Bolsheviks are sufficiently strong on the Term^z line to carry out the necessary repairs. The Sarts reserve the task of cutting it again to themselves in case of a disturbance. The actual condition of events at Bokhara at the present moment is some what obscure. Arrivals who left on the 23rd ultimo state that the Amir had disbanded the majority of his Afghan mercenaries and was engaged in demobilis ing his local footmen and sowars, and that he retains only the men he enter tained in normal times on the spot—the others obviously being within call. Still later arrivals—who left. Bakara on the 2ith—confirm this to some extent, hut add that the Amir had already begun to recall his men to the^ «m i 1 1 Pit i colours, that large numbers of Afghans were present at Bokhara, and that the nroximate arrival of a considerable Afghan force was expected. Ihey report that the Amir had refused to accede to Bolshevik condition and expect a renewal of hostilities. At the present moment it is quite impossible to state which of these two versions is correct. Presumably, however, a telegram would have been received had matters taken a definitely serious turn. It appears probable that the Slav prisoners will be forced by poverty to accept service in the Red Guards, and some 200 at Merv are reported to have done so. Armenians returning from the Caucasus have been disarmed in Trans* caspia by the Bolsheviks. It is not clear whether this means that their arms are required locally for others, or whether any other cause may be at work. Some friction is reported in Transcaspia over the requisitioning by Bolsheviks of wheat from the Turkoman, and some bloodshed is said to have occurred at Kizil Arvat on this account. Reports of the arrival of Turkish troops at Baku and at Petrovsk are insistent in Transcaspia. Meshed, The 1 st June 1918 E. A. P. REDL, Lieut.- Colonel, 0 . S. 0.-1SECRET. o Bbpo&amp;t prom (Krasnovodsk). 16th to 23rd May, —7 soldiers from Askhabad passed to Baku. 4 Russian families sold their houses and property and left for their own country. News received that the Turks had reached Tiflis and were on their way to Baku. Russians are therefore alarmed and leaving in small numbers. No bread had been obtainable for about 3 weeks. Only the railway workmen get any. Two Georgian officers passed through towards Tashkent. It appears that they wished to disarm the Armenians, but the latter refused to surrender their arms. Kuchik Kban is reported to have come towards Bandar Gaz and to hare claimed revenue from the Turkoman (Yomaut). It is even rumoured that he is coming to Kizil Arvat. Some Baluchis and Afghans have recently been arriving from Bandar Gaz in indigent circumstances. It is said that they have been swindled by Armenians in taking up land there. (Possibly the Pathans and Barbaris rejected by the Jangali movement.—E. R.) Russians have been trying to enlist Guards from here to send towards the Afghan frontier. No one could be found. Report from (Askabad). 24th May. —The Russians have posted men at the station with instructions to disarm Armenians. Reports are current that Turkish troops are coming to Baku from Tiflis. Armenians are arriving here from Baku in fear of the Turks. Little urgent for the moment at Bokhara. The Amir is preventing traffic thither. The Kaghan—-Karshi line is under repair. Report from (Merv). 23rd May. —200 Austrian prisoners have been enrolled and sent towards Samarkand. Any candidates are taken in these days. As the Austrians (Slavs in this case E. R.) are in great want I think that they will eventually be com pelled to join. I hear from Bokharan arrivals that the Amir of Bokhara would only give 10 wagons of wheat to the Bolsheviks, and they say that he is prepared to fight. Report »rom (Bokhara). 19th May. —Before the expiration of the 12 days’ grace for which the Amir had asked the Bolsheviks presented him with a second ultimatum as follows 1. Surrender of Khushbegi, Kazi Kalan and 12 influential mullahs. 2. Surrender of his arms and ammunition. 3. A Russian Inspector to be appointed who will work with Khushbegi. 4. Grant of constitution to Bokhara. The Amir protested that a second ultimatium at such a time was out of rules and promised to answer at the expiration of the 12 days originally asked for. Although 6 days were remaining the Bolsheviks suddenly withdrew their troops from Bokhara to Tashkent. The Amir profited by this to arrest daily and execute TO to 15 men of his opponents (presumably Society of Union and Progress),Af-lian^ cor-tiaue io c me to Bokhara for enlistment. They now have great influence there, and both the Amir and his civil and military officers are afraid of them. Two Indians are said to be employed in miking ammunition for the Amir. Two Turkish officers recently reached Kagh.an. There is yet no news of the men he sent to the Caucasus. His troops now number about 50,000. Two batches of Armenians—20 in the first and 50 in the second—from the Caucasus were on their way to Bokhara. Tae first were disarmed by the Bolsheviks at Askhabad and the second at Merv. Two of these arrived at Kaghan with the report that Armenians were fleeing from the Caucasus owing to the arrival of Turkish troops. The Samarkand report to hand says that Kdesov has mode a speech stating that the Caucasus is lost to the Russians and that only Turkistan remains, Every effort must he made to compose all differences in its defence. The contribution demanded by the Bolsheviks from the Samarkand popula tion was not paid within the period given. The Bolsheviks increased the amount, hut are far less insistent than before as to its exaction, they are enlisting both local inhabitants and Persian subjects ir. the Red Guards, and state that every man will be permitted to serve in the place that suits him best. Ration of bread and 250 roubles are granted. On the other hand the number of secret tmijahaddin among the popula tion is increasing. They are waiting to see if the Bokharans will rise. Should a lising occur thov will also j .m in. Secret societies have decided to notify Persian families to leave Kaghan, Bokhara and Obarjui before a rising takes place. The rumour is current both in Bokhara and Kaghan that the Afghans will surely assist should such occur. There are sa d to be 2,500 Russian troops at Samarkand and 500 Austiian prisoners under arras. About 30 million roubles have been sent to Kagha i from Tashkent as oimpensation to the foreigners in late disorders. Some of this has been paid to Russians and Armenians, but no Persian has received anything as yet. The Bolsheviks are mending the Teruuz line by force of their troops and guns. The Sarts will destroy it again if they get a chance. The Amir signs what is put before him but the Kazi Kalan does not carry out his orders. • Another source, 23rd i/ay.—The Bolsheviks have left Kaghan and the surroundings of Bokhara. The Amir has discharged the majority of the Afghans he had enlisted, retaining a small number only. He has also dispersed brother men, bo^h cavalry and infantry, and lias now only the number that he retains in normal times. He has notified Persians at Kerki to leave as he will not be responsible for any damage ro their life or property. Report from (Taskuext). J/ay. —A notice was published here by Trotzki calling on all to combine in opposing internal enemies and to join the Red Guards with that object. The Sarts openly scoffed at this, and but for the presence of the Red Guards a riot would have occurred. Some aeroplanes have now reached Tashkent for the Red Guards. I hear that several waggons full of Austrian prisoners enlisted in the Red Guards have reached Charjui from Transcaspia. Por the moment ther 1 is nothing urgent to report here. Report from (Bokhara) third source.) 24th May .—After the withdrawal of the Bolsheviks from Kaghan the Amir of Bokhara again summoned his troops to the colours. A large number of Afghans were reported present at Bokhara. It was rumoured there that 40,000 Afghans would arrive to assist the Amir. It was said that the Amir had declar ed his intention of fighting again on the 26th May. Meshed j T K A.

Khorasan and North-East Persia. 185. British force .—Lieutenant Eorsyth, 28th Light Cavalry, reached Meshed. Major Bingham, 69th Puniabis, arrived from Turbat-i-Haidari on the 1 st instant. Captain Teague Jones and Lieutenant Ward left for a short visit to Kuchan yesterday. 186. Kuchan.—Bo further arrivals of prisoners are reported for the moment A report from Mianabad states that 2 Turkish prisoners from Kuchan had several private interviews with the Sardar of Bujnurd and his Khans. A correspondent sends a detailed list of Turkish sympathisers at Kuchan most of whom are members of the tf Musavat These comprise the Chief of Police, the Director of Posts and many subordinate government employes and members of Commercial firms. The majority are Azerbaijan or Caucasian Turks, but there is a good sprinkling of Persians proper. Some of these appear to have abandoned democratic tenets in favour of musavatism. Khabat and Vaksin of the “ Commercial Mission ” are very active in anti-ally propaganda, they have stated that a change in events will shortly compel the Armenians to seek refuge elsewhere. They have commenced buying ffrain from the forthcoming harvest. 187. Astrabad.—By the 17th May a Jangali officer and 2 orderlies had reached Astrabad. Shops were closed and a reception, in which the Governor and principal officials of the town took part, was arranged in their honour. Barbaris from Astrabad town and region (mostly of the Poledar section) were compelled to leave by the Persian authorities on the ground of their bein°* British subjects. A few of them went towards Russia and their arrival at Krasnovodsk has been reported, but the majority are en route for Shahrud and probably eventually Meshed. As very few had any arms resistance was out of the question. Our agent who belonged to this tribe has just arrived ; in anti cipation of the probability of this occurrence another man is already on his way. The returned agent states that the original force of about 100 savars near Gumash Tapa has been increased by constant snmll parties of new arrivals till, according to rumour, they now number nearly 1000. He states that the Tur koman agreed to help them but objected that they had few arms and little food. The Jangalis gave a substantial present of rice and stated that they would supply all arms and ammunition necessary as well as rations. What they wanted themselves were Turkoman recruits together with their horses. (It should be noted that this information does not entirely correspond with that received at Tehran). On the road between Astrabad and Shabrud the agent saw no Jangali parties whatsoever. He fell in, however, with a Rashti “ hakim ” an advance agent of the Jangalis, who instructed our man to spread the report as he went that Muhammad Ali Shah with 40,000 Jangali savars was on his way to Meshed. As the doctor stated that he was bound hither and as our agent furnished the post at Sharifabad with his personal descrip tion there is an off-chance that we may become better acquainted. 188. Sabzwar .—2 Germans and 1 Turk from the direction of Kuchan arrived there on the 6 th instant. Travellers have been robbed by men of Aziz Khan Turshizi. i 189. Shahrud .—There is some local excitement at the replacement of the Governor Amir-i-Azam by Itizad-as- 8 altanah. The arrival of the Jangali representative at Astrabad and his reception by the population is confirmed, hut the number of the party is placed at 4 individuals. 190. Dar^’a.—Enquiries made on the spot shew that the rifles before mentioned still remain at Artik (25th May). Members of the Commercial Mission who have visited the place made many enquiries into local resources and conditions including the normal yield of grain. * sSllgsbI P| hU '■ i: f| : !^ I fJI I ^ I' The cofrespoudent reports that at the beginning of May a German was active among the Turkoman in the Askhabad, Merv, and Tejen districts, among other things collecting a list of British sympathisers—presumably with a view to dealing with them effectively hereafter. He is reported to have been formerly captured by the Russians in Persia, confined at Tiflis and released by the Ingushi, and as his demeanour is described as truculent it looks uncom monly like our old acquaintance Wilhelm Paschen. The individual is reported to have left via Kuchan for Tehran with the data he has collected, and under present circumstances he will no doubt reach his destination safely. 192. Langar. —A Barbari named Mirza Muhammad Jumah, who had been at Herat for about a month, arrived there and stated that he had been instructed by the Naib-ul-Hukumah of Herat to deliver a message to all Barbaris in Persia that should they desire to return to Afghanistan, land for cultivation would be afforded them and the sponge passed over the slate of former shortcomings. Their vakils should be sent to Herat to discuss the matter. If this proves to be true it is no doubt an attempt to secure the promising raw Barbari material for Herat military forces. The delegate reached Langar on the 27th May. 193. Sarakhs. —Little of interest is reported except that 2 'fidais from a distant country *’ well provided with money and transport had reached Russian Sarakhs, and that enquiries concerning them were in progress. Enemy agents appear to be indicated. 194. Local affairs. —The Governor-General is now sufficiently recovered to transact business and held the usual formal reception on the Shah’s birthday, and it may be hoped that by his agency some improvement may be achieved as regards the passage of enemy agents and prisoners, his illness having caused an unfortunate delay. Dabir-us Sultan has left for Sabzwar as Governor designate accompanied by the Rais-i-Qushun in view of local opposition. Jalal -as-Sultan has arrived at Jam. Both of these officials have been well affected to us in the past. At a recent meeting of a mixture of the local Caucasian Committee and the Secret Committee the latest numbers of Jangali papers and letters from Jangalis at Rasht are reported to have been read, and the tone of the meeting to have been friendly to the Jangalis. Distress continues and typhus and typhoid are rife. Herat axd Afghanistan. 195. Germans and adherents. —Up to the 31st ultimo the strength and composition of this party is reported to be the same as before. They are ap parently encouraged by reports of Turkish doings and there have been several secret interviews with the Herat chief officials. They are actively spreading rumours of the proximate arrival of Turkish and German troops. In this con nection a reliable informant states. “ There is no doubt that a secret treaty has been made at Kabul, but no one can say what it contains. At the same time why should these people be allowed to remain as they do at Herat ? 196. The Hasht Yak. —Of the 1700 recruits obtained by this conscription 1383 have been posted as follows :—The remainder were rejected by the Indian doctor as medically unfit. The Naib Salar has permitted the payment of substitutes at 200 krans, anyone exacting a higher rate being liable to punishment. It is stated that the 10th Herati (late Khassadars) will be brought up to the establishment of 600. Recruits so far collected hail from the immediate surroundings of Herat. Voluntary recruiting for the cavalry continues. 197. Military affairs .—The Naib Salar has rejected for the time a pro posal that the grain ration allowed to old sepoys should be taken from them in favour of the recruits. Among articles brought from Russia are 25 magazine rifles. A rumour is current at Herat that 3 battalions have left Kabul for Herat, but at present it lacks any sort of confirmation. Russian Tukkistan. 198. Current events .—A messenger is overdue ; there is therefore no news since dated the end of May, but had anything important occurred it is probable that a telegram would have been received. As far as can be judged there is little change in the situation reported last week. Doubt is expressed in the good faith both of the Amir of Bokhara and of the Bolsheviks towards one another, and tension continues. Austrian prisoners in Transcaspia who had not accepted service in the Red Guard have now been brought together and set to municipal and other tasks. Their lot is evidently very different from that of their comrades who had accepted service. According to the papers large numbers of war prisoners have been reaching Samara both by the Siberian and Tashkent lines, owing to a prevalent rumour that they were to be repatriated. Organisation among them was entirely absent and typhus was rife. Enquiries on the subject of the German agent Ebert said to be living at Samarkand elicited the report that he had left for Askhabad two to three weeks ago with the avowed intention of proceeding to Persia, Meshed having been mentioned as his destination. There has been a hiatus in the supply of newspapers owing to the suppres sion of the “ Askhabad ” and its reappearance as ^ The Voice of Central Asia” under management of the Staff of the Central Asian Railway at Askhabad. Owing to this the full account of the representative meeting at Tashkent when an autonomous administration for Turkistan was declared by the Bolsheviks, has been missed. Numbers received up to the 23th instant contain little of interest. The removal of Transcaspian administration from Askhabad to Merv, owing to the counter-revolutionary leanings of the former, lias been discussed so far without result. Reports state that a public holiday was held at Askha- bad on the 26th ultimo owing to the report of the nomination of the Tsarevich to the throne, and that prisoners were released. There is, therefore, perhaps something to be said for the Bolshevik point of view. The question of a general arming of the population, including the Turko man was also discussed at Askhabad, and nothing decisive was arrived at partly owing to want of arms, partly to objections that racial feuds might result. The “ Commercial Mission ” is mentioned as having returned to Askhabad on com pletion of its investigations. This we know is far from being the case, but it is no doubt a fact that some members have returned, others being busy in pur chases with more or less suspicious objects in view. Machine-guns, as well as rifles and much ammunition, are reported to have been looted from Gunbad-i-Kabus in the Turkoman raid under Jangali instiga tion. A Bolshevik move towards Orenburg is again rumoured.. Meshed ; The 8th June 1918. J 1 (Sd.) E. A. F.

A. P. REDL, Lieut.•Colonel) G. S. O.-l. S8HGSB-45-15-748—GCPB' 204 I'd igues —The following items of information regarding tlie proceed ings of the Secret Caucasian Committee here are from a source which proved very reliable in former years. 1. After the abortive search of Safdar Beg’s house (paragraph 177) 35 rifles which had been concealed there were removed and despatched to Sabzwar to be concealed by the agent of Nobel and Company there. Some days asfter the search bv Caucasian agency a Turkish officer and 2 soldiers were secretly sent out of the towr. Another officer and 2 men were subsequently despatched towards Sabzwar disguised as tullab or as dervishes. 2. At a meeting of the Secret Committee the despatch of a delegate to the Jangalis was discussed. He has apparent^ not yet been sent. 3. The following items of news were read and discussed :— (а) The arrival of advanced Turkish troops at Derbenf, Petrcvsk and Baku. ( б ) A telegram from Tabriz with iutelligence of the departure of British officers and officials. (c) A telegram from Hamadan stating that 600 Indian troops with automobiles and camel transport had passed through Hamadan. (d) A telegram from Azerbaijan to the effect that severe punishment would he meted out to persons refusing Turkish notes, and forbidding the carrying of arms by civilians. The submission of the people of Ardagan to the Turks. (&lt;&gt;) The arrival of German tnops in Daghistan. The departure through Bussian territory of a German officer in disguise for Afghanistan 205. Prisoners. —The Governor-General has telegraphed to Tehran stat ing that he is expending 25 tomans daily on the upkeep of the Austrian and I urkish prisoners here. Unless the Central Government will ratify this the only courses open to him are to let them starve, or to release them—in which casi the English will capture them. It is onderstood that no reply has yet been received. Hera.t and Afghanistan. 201. Germans and adherents —Kazim Beg has evidently not renounced his enmity for the British Agent, and in pursuance of it approached the Naib Salar on his most tender spot. After flattering remarks as to the progress in the military art of the Herat troops, he suggested that the Agent rendered regular reports concerning them, and pressed for his removal. The Naib Salar replied that the matter was beyond his power. A fugitive Turk, smd to be an escaped prisaner, has reached Herat and was secluded by order of the Naib-ul-Hukumah. Kazim Beg was unable to see the mau. On a report that Ka dm Beg communicated freely with Russia by Turko man agency the Naib-ul-Hukumah gave orders for a stricter watch on the frontiers. Reliable information received from India states that Mohendro Partap reached Constantinople from Berlin on the 17 th May, and was expected to proceed to Afghanistan shortly. A local agent reports hearing that Mohendro had left Berlin for Afglianistanbearing a letter from the Emperor of Germany to the Amir of Afghanistan In any case his interception would be of the , greatest importance. 207. Military affairs. —O'&amp;CQis t\Tu\ non-commissioned officers who were discharged as too old on the arrival of the Naib Solar were for some time in receipt of their former pay. The Naib Salar has now decided that such as are fit for civil work should be placed at the disposal of the Naib-ul-Hukumah and the remainder would be retired without pay. 28. Artillery men were sent up for inspection by the Indian doctor as too old for efficient service, In invaliding them out the doctor remarked thatthere were many other old men in the corps. The Officer Covnmvnding Artil lery agreed but stated that it was impossible to dispense with their services at the present time. 30 to 40 men per infantry battalion have also been discharged on the score of age. b The Isiaib Silar has sent 50,000 Icrctns to an officer at Hala Murghah for the purchase of remounts. He is reported to have despatched 30,000 krans to India for books and stationery destined fora military college at Herat which he is reputed to have the intention of instituting. r 208. News from Kabul.—An arrival at Herat from Kabul 'ives the follow ing information: ( 1 ) Great activity prevails in the Kabul Arsenal Guns are carefully inspected by the “Turkisn Sipahsdar ” aud by Austrians Any repairs indicated are carried out at once, ant after a second inspection the funs are handed over to the troops. Guns and rifles are being manufactured and are being sent to the southern frontiers from Kabul. (2) Hash?-yak conscripts who have completed their term of 3 years are not being released from military service. New conscripts are being brought in and intensively drilled. Some 2,000 conscripts who had been employed '’in workshops and kindred duties have been withdrawn and are being given mili tary framing. When efficient they will be returned to their former work. Russian Turkistan. t 209. Current events.—There is no relaxation in the tension in Turkistan although for the moment no serious disorders have occurred. The new Bol shevik republic is far from strong. In the north they are engaged with Dutov’s topees near Orenburg. At Tashkent famine, typhus and cholera combine to produce distressing conditions. Up to the harvest the failure of grain supplies due in great measure to disturbances in the Caucasus and in Russia cannot fairly be laid at their door, but by mismanagement of the present harvest which is reported to be satisfactory they are not only e?trnin^ universal unpopularity but appear to be in a fair way to provoke a Turkoman revolt which would have the most serious consequences. It is stated that the Turkoman are determined to resist the forcible requisition of their grain supplies, and a report just to hand states that in the Askhabad district the Eolsheviks have already taken grain by force at a rate fixed by themselves. Turkistan and especially Transoaspia are full of alarmist rumours of of the arrival of the Turkish forces on the Caspian, a considerable general alarm is in consequence prevalent. A Russian officer who has just returned after a month’s travel in Turkistan was struck by the fact that wherever he went he heard it stated that the English were on the way to occupy Turkistan—even if they had not already entered. All classes looked upon this consummation as the only issue from their troubles, and in his opinion such a measure, if feasible, would be warmly received, especially by the native population. As a pis-aHrr a German occupation would probably be accepted, and the activity of German officers at Tashkent, who make a point of visiting the mosques for the purpose, leaves nothing to he desired in the rosy light in which they depict a Germanised Turkistan. These officers inform the Sarta that the German occupation will be an accomplished fact within the next 2 to 3 months. The passage of German agents from Transcaspia to Baku apparently to report progress—is reported. Another party of some 15 persons left for Astra- chan. ^ It appeared probable that they might be the trade-agents at Askhabad returning, hut as by latest reports the latter are still there, it is not unlikely that they are a party of German (or Austrian) officers and men who recently reached Bokhara from Afghanistan, and subsequently proceeded westwards. They apparently met with a bad reception at the hands of Comrade Schmidt’ the Bolshevik Political Agent at Kaghan, who accused them of spying, tui oifered no obstacle to their passage towards Askhabad. Others were said to be on the way, but there is so far no intelligence of their passage.According to another report which may be taken to be more reliable than that noted last week, Ebert is still at Samarkand where he is in Bolsheyik em ployment as a subordinate commissary. He is said not to enjoy much influence as such, but the employment would no doubt be a very useful one for his nefnri ous purposes. - At the end of May Turkish officers from Bokhara held a secret meetin' at Bairam Ali, attended by various Turkoman khans, at which Turkish prona ganda was actively carried on. ^ ^ The Bolsheviks appear to have withdrawn practically all their forces from Bokharan territory. The Amir’s troops guard the whole of the railway in his territory, and although the situation is outwardly and for the moment quiet a iccent ariival considered that little would be required to precipitate a conflict The Amir continues to enlist Afghans, Turkomans and other residents of Transcaspia. ^ He is reported to have recruiting agents at Herat, Mazar, and Merw Repair carried out on the Termez line is frequently undone subsequently The Bolsheviks are enlisting workmen in Transcaspia for Tashkent with what purpose is not yet known. A report has reached me that an engineer at Kushk is calling for workmen to “ continue the line to Herat,** The matter is being investigated. The Bolsheviks have now despatched 3 aeroplanes to Kushk 4 are reported at Samarkand and 10 at Tashkent. According to a registration of prisoners of war in Turkistan for the 1 st uf t0 «f stood at some 38,000 men (Austrians and Germans) and upwards of 1,600 officers. It is probable that a fair proportion of these have since left the country, but a commission—apparently Germans and Swedes^-in this con nection is reported to have been in Transcaspia and to have gone on to Samar kand.

He intended to return to Ashkabad eventually. I lost track of him at Baku, but I heard on my return to Krasnovodsk that there is no dou ) that he is a German. 17th May .—A Persian resident of Tabriz arrived at Baku. He was said to have been sent by the Turks to persuade the inhabitants of Baku not to oppose the Turkish forces in any way. 22nd UViy.—'Some Germans are reported to have passed to Astrakhan from Lenkoran. 6 Zenjani Persians arrived at Krasnovodsk from Astraehan. They said they had been arrested by Germans there and had had much aim- culty in obtaining their release. 26th May .—4 residents of Maimanah passed through for Hasan Quli and Chikishliyar. 28th Mav. —About 15 Germans, who were dressed as and appeared to be merchants, passed from the direction of Ashkabad to Astraohan. They had 2 ladies with them. 30th May .—A German with 2 Lesghians arrived from Ashkabad and proceeded to Baku. He is said to have come to an arrangement with l ersian Turkomans and to be returning to report his success to the Turkish troops. 1st June .—2 Armenians and 2 Georgians arrived from Baku. Prom the way in which they praised the Turks it is pretty evident that they must be Turkish agents. After a 2 days’ stay they went on to Ashkabad. 3rd June .—A number of persons have been taken ill to hospital. Many of them have died. People say that the sickness is due to a fish diet, and even that they have been poisoned in the hospital. Report from (Mery). 4th /Mm?.—An engineer has proceeded to Kushk and has sent men here to engage workmen for a line which is said is to be built from Kushk to Herat. Good pay is offered to skilled men-from 500 to 2,000 roubles a month. The rumour runs that the British Government will pay tdie expenses. I wi 1 go oft and investigate the matter as soon as I have finished the work you told me t&lt; do. 4 Austrians arrived here ; it is said for the purpose of investigating the treatment of the Austrian prisoners. A reliable informant tells me that Cossacks and Bolsheviks are fighting at Orenburg. Railway traffic from Tashkent to Orenburg is forbidden to passengers. I send you the following information re the Turkoman.^ The Merv Turkoman have 2 divisions, the Okhtamish and the T “ k ^ a “ 19h ; th Akke 1 Yolatan, Takhta Bazar and Kushk are the Sank. Merv Turkoman are the Tekke, those of Tejen, Dushakh and Khaka are the Alili. At Ashkabad are the Akhal, and those towards Charjui and Kerki are the Ansan. The principal chiefs of the Tokhtamish are : 1. Yusuf Khan. 2. Hakkum Khan. 3. Qara Khan.Their chiefs of II or sub-tribes are : Abashman. Arnawirdi Khan. Mullah Qaol Murad. Arna Murad. Jaganbai. Ata Niaz. Hassan Takka. Bishan Bai. The chiefs of the Tokhtaraish II are : These are the principal heads of the Tribes of Turkoman between Kras- novodosk and Charjui. The richest of them all is one Wali Khan. He has given, it is said, a million roubles this year to alleviate distress among the Turkoman. * Ynssuf Khan was given the honorary rank of Colonel by the Tsar. He lives at Bairam Ali. He frequently visited Petrograd under the old regime and has several decorations. Arna I)urdi Khan has the rank of a Captain. His ancestors were people of note. 26th May. —On the 21st instant I received a report from Samarkand that 7 aeroplanes had reached that place. After this a train of some 45 wagons ■with soldiers on board passed through. I followed by post train and overtook them at Yolatan where I personally saw that there were 3 aeroplanes in the train. 2 Turkish and 6 Bokharan officers held a secret meeting at Bairam Ali at which the heads of the Merv and 27 other principal men of the Bairam Ali and Tejen Turkoman were present. The gist of the Turks’ address was that the majority of the enemies of Islam ha 1 been defeated ; the Caucasus would soon be in Turkish hands ; the British can only depend on Japan and China, and it is possible that the Chinese would soon be on the Turkistan Frontier. No one should believe the rumours that Afghans would assist the Bokharans ; they will neither do that nor rise. The Turks have discussed the matter thoroughly with the Afghans and are sure of this. We (Turks) wish for the help of the Turkoman only. Do not listen to foreigners nor take their gold. The Turks subsequently returned to Bokhara. The Persian Hajji Oghli Bey was present with them. 42 camel loads of arms were received at Bokhara from Kerki. According to some they were sent by the Afghans ; others state that the Bokharan Governor was able to secure them on the pretext that they w T ould be looted by the Afghans if they came. On the 21st instant a rumour w r as current that 25,000 Afghans were coming via Sarai Kamar. Bokharan officials pretended Kopak Bai. Manar Bai. Qarabai. Tobebai. Daulathai. Ama Muhammad.

This line is^ under repair but as fast as a portion is mended it is again destroyed by the natives. Some sowars have been sent by the Amir but with what result is not known. Some 1,800 Bokharan troops have been sent to Karakul; formerly there were none there* Afghans and residents of all parts of Turkistan daily arrive for enlistment in the Amir’s troops j there must be 2,000 Afghans or Berberis. While at Merv I personally saw 10 to 15 men leaving daily for that purpose. A Merv coffee-shop keeper, named Haji Khan, apparently acts as a recruiting agent. He was also cognizant of the arrival of the Turkish and Bokharan officers mentioned. Turkistan is now full of spies, and no man can be trusted. On May 25th 2 Germans arrived at Merv to see the Austrian prisoners and enquire as to their treatment. I think one must be a Turk as they talked in French which Germans together would never have done. They afterwards left for Samarkand. All letters reaching Kaghan are now opened bv the Bokharans before delivery. Members of the Union and Progress Society who accompanied Kolesov to Tashkent and who are now at Samarkand have secretly notified Persians at Kaghan to remove their families as trouble at Bokhara is probable. Many families have been removed to Merv and Askhabad in consequence. Prom Turkoman Bed Guards who had been at Tashkent I learnt that 17 aeroplanes had been received there. 7 of these had been sent to Samarkand and Kushk and 10 were at Tashkent. At Samarkand 2 have been flying as the residents think, to threaten them. The Amir's troops guard Bokhara and the country for 15 miles on each side. On the statement of a head official of the Khushbegi 16 Tabrizi mans of powder are made daily at Bokhara, and 2 Turks, 3 Afghans and an Austrian are busy in making ammunition. Another source, 3rd June .—I was arrested at Kaghan by the Bokharans but eventually obtained my release and managed to enter the city. It was full of the Amir’s troops and there were several thousand Afghans among them. The Amir is said to have active recruiting agents both at Mazar and at Herat. The line is guarded by the Amir’s men from Charjni to near Samarkand. He is also recruiting Turkomans. Between Kaghan and Bokhara there is a guard-house of 20 men every 500 yards. 5 aeroplanes have reached Samarkand from Tashkent, three of which are for Kushk. The Termez line is not yet repaired and no one can reach Termez by rail. I will fetch the reports from Mazar as soon as traffic to Termez is possible. Exports of fighting between Cossacks and Bolsheviks at Orenburg are prevalent everywhere. I saw 2 Germans dressed as Turks proceeding by train from Samarkand to Krasnovodsk. There are 40 Bolshevik Bed Guards with 3 guns at Tejen. Aziz Khan, the Tejen Turkoman chief, was there with 500 sowars. He was about to fight witn his rivals. At Bokhara a number of people died from drinking the water of a well. The Amir ordered the town wells to be filled in. «( 4th June. —Some 200 Russian Red Guaids who had been at Kaghan had all left for Samarkand. The Russians hare repaired the Karsbi line, but the Bokharans are con- tinually damaging it again. No tickets are issued from Tashkent to Orenburg. The Armenians are now paying less attention to the Bolshevik orders and refuse to proceed to Orenburg against the Cossacks. The latter are now said to he stronger than the Bolsheviks. Later reports just in received too late for this mail. They contain nothing urgent. Meshed, '1 15th June 1918 .J ¥ E. A. F. BEDE, Lieutenant-Colotiel, a. s. o. i. rSECRET .

Captain Teague-Jones and Lieutenant Ward returned from Kuchan early in the ^ 211 . Kuchan. The Governor General has succeeded in effecting the arrest of Shujah-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, without any resistance, and he has arrived at Meshed under escort. Steps are in progress to remove the Kuchan Karguzar and his assistant. Both are deservedly unpopular there and in addition are strongly anti-British. In spite of very careful investigations on the spot the actual facts as to the Commercial Mission ” are not yet cleared up. They are spending money most freely on the very spacious caravansarai hired by them at Kuchan, and in addi tion to paving the barrack-like stores are putting in ample windows. Their only object for the present, they state, is the purchase of dried fruits, and the windows appear somewhat unnecessary for the storage of these. They are reported to have received a considerable remittance of money. The Kuchan Rais-ut-Tujjar, Habib Agha, is reported to assist escaped Turkish prisoners with money and guides. It is understood that he has written to Darajiz stating that it is not advisable for the moment that prisoners should be sent via Kuchan, and recommending the direct route through Bujnurd. 212 . Darajiz .—The Deputy Governor Zabardast Khan and the telegraphist are both reported to assisting escaped Turkish prisoners, and till lately hav^e been forwarding them to Kuchan. It is stated that the Karguzar (apparently of Kuchan) has been notified that sums spent on German, Austrian, and Turkish prisoners will be reimbursed by the respective legations. Information from two sources states that a party of 8 persons, said to comprise German and Turkish officers disguised in Tartar dress, has reached Askhabad from Baku with the intention of proceeding to 'Tehran through Darajiz. 2 * 3 . On the journey from Tehran (which occupied 12 days) Captain Jarvis neither saw nor heard of any Jangali forces on or near the Tehran-Meshed road. He was advised, however, by an apparently well-meaning person not to delay unduly by the way. 214 . Prisoners .—A Turkish officer is reported to be in the neighbourhood of Shahrud with the mission of diverting prisoners proceeding to Tehran towards Astrabad with the object of their reaching Enzeli. A telegram from Bujnurd reports the arrival of 3 Turkish prisoners there on the 20 th instant and departure for Tehran next day. With reference to paragraph 204 ( 1 ), it is now stated that 2 Turks proceeded towards Turbat-i-Haidari disguised as doctors, that they procured a guide there and continued their journey towards Sistan, and that the Russian Vice-Consular officers de Beauvais and Maximov were cognizant of their presence. Another Turk is reported to have been smuggled out of the town previously, and to have proceeded towards Kirman via Duhuk. He is also said to be travel ling as a doctor. 215 . Quarantine .—A detachment of Persian savars has been posted on the Russian frontier as a precautionary measure against cholera. This is probably accountable for the non-arrival during the week of the usual special messengers. As the post from Russia is practically non-existant it is to be feared that our communications will be considerably hampered.216 . Police .—It is understood that the Swedish officer, Major taking charge of the police department from the present incumbent. Herat and Afghanistan. Sjoberg 217 . Germans and adherents. —Kazim Beg and his friends are very active in propaganda. They now insist strongly on the prospect of the arrival of a Turkish and German force on the Afghan frontier md Transcaspia. The Naib- ul-Hukumah, with his usual caution, reserved judgment on their news, but it is probable that it produces some effect in less well-balanced minds. Kazim also criticized the endurance of the Herat troops, and stated his conviction that they should be inured to fatigue by longer hours of parade. As the Naib Salar sub sequently made some such pronouncement to the troops it is probable that these remarks were not without effect. 2 1 8 . Military affairs. —The construction of a new cavalry barrack is under consideration. The conscription of recruits by the “ hasht-yak ” has been stopped for the present in order to allow of rectification of the lists compiled for the purpose. Infantry battalions are still below strength. Drill is to be curtailed during Ramazan. Russian Turkistan. 219 . Current events. —Information has reached Meshed which a telegram from Darajiz tends to confirm, that matters have come to a head between the . Bolsheviks and the Turkoman, and that fighting is-in progress near Askhabad. Reports give somewhat contradictory reports as to the Armenian attitude, some saying that contrary to expectation they have thrown in their lot with the Turko man, and others that part of them are siding with the Mensheviks and the Turko man, others with the Bolsheviks. Further information must be awaited, but should the news prove to be true, and the conflict to be of a serious nature, the conse quences will probably be most unfortunate having regardto the trend of events in the Caucasus. It can only be surmised that the forcible collection of the harvest grain has precipitated the conflict with the Turkoman which was not unex pected. According to a source which appears sufficiently reliable, up to a week ago the Armenians were on excellent relations with the Bolsheviks who had just empowered the former to arm themselves from the Government stores and in the absence^ of any but the most cogent reasons—or sudden developments—-their taking sides against the Bolsheviks is considered unlikely. Reports received previous to this information state that at Askhabad the Bolsheviks had already taken over Turkoman crops at 50 roubles a pud for wheat and 45 for barley. In the scheme for the “ realisation of the harvest ” published in the papers of the 7 th instant it was stated that 15 roubles would be paid for the wheat and 10 for the barley, and the raising of the amount fixed looks as if trouble were anticipated. Red Guards were also being raised from all classes at Askha bad, but their destination seems to be Tashkent. On the 10 th instant there were reported to be 600 Red Guards at Samar kand, 200 at Charjui, 400 at Merv and 700 at Askhabad, of whom 400 were on the frontiers. There is also a body of 250 Armenians underarms at Askhabad and it is possime that these have been confused with the Red Guards There were no Bolsheviks at Bokhara where the Amir continues to increase his local force, as many as 5 000 Afghans now being said to be under arms A delegate has returned from Afghanistan with a somewhat indefinite answer and others^are said to be on the way to Afghanistan with fresh instructionL The Amir of Bokhara is supposed to have the intention of joining with other inhabitants of Turkistan in opposing the Bolsheviks, and to be awaiting a favourable moment. An “ Indian Rajah ” accompanied by 2 Turks is reported to be at Bokhara— or at any rate to have been there 10 days ago-and it seems most probable that this may be Mohendro rartap. rNew,s regarding Dutov is still indefinite, bat be is said to have advanced slightly along the line from Orenburg, and no railway tickets have been issued beyond Tashkent for some time. • General jnervousness regarding events in the Caucasus continues and rumour constantly places the Turks in the vicinity of Baku or in the town itselh Meshed ; ^ E.

The agent arrived at each place just after the German had left. He had apparently been among both the Goklan and the Yomut, but had not succeeded in inducing any recruits to join, and had left apparently to Mazandaran. J From another source it is reported that the Sardar of Bujnurd continues to purchase rifles freely and much speculation as to his motives is aroused therebv. He recently purchased 120 magazine rifles smuggled from Askhabad at 2,250 roubles apiece, and distributed them among bw khans He has great prestige among the Yomut Turkoman which is increased by help in supplies given them by him this year, without which many would have starved. The attitude of the Bujnurdis is reported to have become very anti-British, largely owing to the propaganda carried on by enemy prisoners and agents who pass through. 224. Sabzwar. Noble s agent is reported to be active in assisting enemy prisoners on their way to Tehran. He also appears to dabble in arms and ammunition traffic. 225. Intrigues. —The following items of information have been received and discussed by the Caucasian Committee here. 1 . 500 Turkish troops with 6 guns reached Tabriz from Sujbulak. They have received permission to use the Caucasus for hostilities against the British. Their troops have been detailed for 2 routes, J via Gilan, and \ via Turkistan 70 Turkish officers under an officer of high rank have reached Tabriz. 2. Nine officers have been despatched in disguise. 6 have reached Askha- bad and 3 are visiting the Turkoman near Geok Tapa (reference paragraph 212). Other Turks are to come to Krasnovodsk and to Mazandaran. It is also stated that the Persian doctors who have proceeded to the Rus sian frontier have received a hint from this Committee to permit enemy agents, or prisoners to pass without undergoing the quarantine. Herat and Afghanistan. 220. Germans and adherents.—K&amp;z\m Beg continues to develop the theme of Turkish movements against the British. He states their forces will operate by h routes (a) through Khorasau to Sistan (b) through Transcaspia and Herat, and (&lt;?) Mazar and Kabul. According to him tribes on the Indian frontier have already been assigned their share in operations.227 Military The Naib Salar has flogged, heavily fined, and imprisoned for 4 vea.s a Captain of Sappers, convicted of drawing pay for men who had been permitted to proceed to their homes. Two Subadars of m- have also been dismissed. The collection of hay in the Herat province is being continued, and gives rise to the idea among the people that their nation will shortly enter the war. The Naib Salar continues to purchase any Russian magazine rifles he can. So far very few have been sent him. Russian Turkistan. 228. Current events —According to telegrams despatched on the 25th and 27th instant a truce has been patched up between the conflicting parties at Askhabad after fighting of no very serious character in which the EoMevik Commissioner Tuzin and some 10 to 20 men appear to have been killed Just previously to the collision the Bolsheviks had published an order that all males from 20 to 35 were to he enrolled as a reserve for the Kevolutionary forces, and that all former officers were again to be enrolled, and it is possible that this brought matters to a head. The fighting appears to have been entirely between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks on Minimalists consisting mainly of the rail way workmen, the “ Frontoviki' (soldiers who had served at the front), part of the Red Guard, and the non-Bolshevik Russian elements. Owing probably to a combination of cholera, quarantine, and Ramzan, special communications are still delayed and the actual situation is not ch ar beyond the fact that hostilities have ceased for the present. There are, however, many reports that the Mensheviks have won at Ashkabad and that at Mere, Samarkand, and even according to rumour, at Tashkent the Bolsheviks have resigned in favour of their ^opponents. Although owing to the pressure from the Orenburg direction which Butov is undoubtedly exercising, their unpopularity with all classes of the population, and the growth of the Menshevik movement in many parts of Russia, there is a strong possibility of this version proving the correct one it is impossible to p'a: e much reliance on reports to hand for the moment, and more authoritative information must be awaited. Reports from Tashkent relating to mid-June chronicle the hasty despatch of whatever elements the Bolsheviks w^re able to scrape together towards Orenburg, where from the number of wounded reaching Tashkent the Bolsheviks appear to be getting the worst of the fighting. They had also apparently been compelled to s nd detachments towards Charjui and Khiva to oppose a possible Menshevik movement, and their efforts to obtain recruits at high payment in Transeaspia for service against the Cossacks were meeting with little success. The Armenian position is also for the moment obscure. On the 15th instant they were reported to be in the full confidence of the Bolsheviks, and to be in charge of the public security of Ashkabad. On the 22nd instant it was said that the Bolsheviks had mobilised the Armenians armed for self-defence in their own forces. (The Armenians had been appre hensive of this—desiring to remain for possible eventual hostilities against the Turks but to avoid fighting the Bolsheviks’ battles against Cossacks or other parties). More lately still it is rumoured that the Armenians had been d s- armed by the Mensheviks, 'there is no confirmation of the report as originally veceived that the Turkoman had been involved as a class. They appear to have held entirely aloof although isolated individuals serving in the Red Guard or other formations may have taken part in the fighting. The Amir of Bokhara continues in a state of readiness, and there is as yet no news as to what action he has taken with respect to the most recent hap penings. German and Turkish agents are reported at Bokhara, and by some account the Amir himself strongly Turkophile. The probability is that Bokharans, Turkomans and others will incline to the strongest party and to that first on the spot. Should any considerable or relatively considerable Turkish force succeed in reaching Turkistan, as matters stand at present, they would in all probability be joined by the native races—if only in self-defence.

There are at the same time all sorts of rumours that he is inviting other contractors to take over the farm of various villages. Secret meetings of Kadkhudas have been held to discuss the Director’s actions, and the latter in consequence is said to have applied to Tehran for permission to enlist 40 more Revenue gendarmes for his protection. He has also asked the Governor, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, to transfer the Sistani contingent of Cavalry sowars to Birjand, as they are ill-disposed towards him, and to send Kainis down in their place. The Khidri Robbery Case. See diary No. 30 of 1917. At the request of the Deputy Governor of Herat the Governor of Kainat and Sistan, after referring to me, has sent an agent, Ahmed Ali Beg Deputy Governor of Awaz, to Herat to take over the property (turquoises chiefly) which has been recovered. Shaukat-ul-Mulk is sending presents, I hear, a carpet and some saffron, to the Deputy Governor and some saffron to the Solar. Apparently he hopes to get some difficulty regarding his property m Herat settled at the same time. News from Afghanistan.

He is making satisfactory progress but unfortunately much of his work is at a standstill, and the democrats are taking the opportunity to raise their heads again. 2 . M. Shoulberg, a Swedish officer of gendarmerie, has arrived to take over control of the city and provincial police forces. It is said that the democrats are intriguing to arrange for the separation of these two bodies, in order that only one of them may come under the new arrival. I will act in the matter after making the acquaintance of the latter. 3. The Government of Chinaran Radkan, Kuh Payat, and the neighbour hood, has been given to Mani-us-Sultanah, who came with the Kawwam from Tehran and is an unknown quantity here. 4. Persian affairs (local). —By order of the Governor General 1,000 bread tickets were issued to paupers for the delivery to each person of 5 seers daily during the past week. We have also recommenced our relief work in a selected place out side the town, our ow r n premises being no longer used on account of the prevalence of typhus and typhoid fevers among the poorer classes. Two of my escort sowars are suffering from the latter disease ; and it is supposed that they contracted it wdiile engaged in this wmrk. Between two and three thousand people have been fed daily, and this number may perhaps increase if w r e can find a larger enclosure. 5 . The Kawrwam has asked permission from Tehran to establish a quarantine post at Lutfabad against cholera, which is said to have broken out in several places in Turkistan, particularly Khokand. 6 . Persian affairs (general). —Turkoman raids are reported from villages on the Daragaiz frontier, and the Governor General has asked for 300 additional sowars to be placed at his disposal to guard this portion of his territory. 7 . As a sequel to a post robbery at Abdulabad near Shmwan a robber of note named Saiyid Hashim and tw r o of his men were captured. The stolen property was recovered. 8 . It is reported that the sowars of Aziz-ullah Khan, Turshizi, aie plundering in the Sabzaw-ar district : the Governor of w r hich has been summoned to Mesned in connection wdth the changes mentioned in paragraph 1 last week. 9 . British affairs. —To the deep regret of all classes and creeds in Meshed tiie Rev. Hr. Esselstyn of the American Presbyterian Mission died on the 30th May of typhus fever which there is little doubt had been contracted while he w r as en gaged in famine relief work either on our premises or on those of the Mission, i Hr. Hoffman is suffering from a severe attack of typhoid, but is likely to recover. As stated above two of our sowars are suffering from typhoid, and one of the Con- sualte servants is recovering from typhus. 10 . The Foreign Office have telegraphed to the Karguzar of Meshed enquiring as to the purpose for which Captain Abd-us-Samad Shah, relative of His Highnesss the Agha Khan, is coming to this country. I have not yet been asked by the Karguzar. , 11 . Captain Teague-Jones and Lieutenant Ward arrived at Meshed on the 31st May : the former to discuss' with me regarding work with the troops in Khorassan, and the latter to assist in intelligence work. 12 . More recent communication with Saiyid Haidar (paragraph 10 last week) shows that nothing serious is wrong, but he does not help much in the elucidation of the murder of our dak sowar. A special deputation has gone to Jam in connec tion with the enlistment of Hazara sowars in pur levy corps.13 Russian affairs.— de Beauvais left for Turbat-i-Haidari on tbe 27tli May and M Antipin for Askabad on the 28th idem, the latter being escorted as far as Chinaran by a party of the 28th Light Cavalry. The Caucasian party have undertaken to return to their former relations, with the Russian Consulate, and M Nicholsky has promised to give his attention to their affairs. They have also promised me to abstain from helping enemy agents and escaped prisoners, but reports of their attitude in this suggest that they have no intention of keeping their word, and more arrests may be necessary. Meshedi Ghulam (paragraph 12 last week) has left Meshed for Turbat-i-Haidari en route to India. 14. In reply to a reference from the Karguzar of Sarakhs regarding a party of some 600 Russian Turkomans who wished to emigrate from Russian territory into Persia the Foreign Office asked the Karguzar for his opinion in the matter. The latter did not recommend that the Turkomans should be allowed to come over. 15. Persian and German intrigues. —The talk at the democrat meetings during the week has been moderate in tone : approval having been expressed at the arrest of the Russian agitator Antipin. Some hope was entertained that matters for democracy might not after all be so bad, m view of the fact that the new Cabinet in Tehran was already in a precarious condition. 16 Reports of the arrival in Meshed and elsewhere of Turkish agents are fre quently received, and they are very difficult to trace. Their number in the city is now said to be 16, and an attempt was made by a friend last night to collect them all in one house in order that they might be arrested. The arrangements fell through, but it is hoped that it may be brought off on another day soon. The illness of the Governor General referred to above makes it impossible to invoke his assistance at present. The arrival of four Austrians at Sabzawar, and two Turkish officers at Nisha' pur is announced, and in regard to the former our Karguzar has been asked to supply money for expenses. He has not yet replied. We hear also that a German in disguise, with three Persians, has come to Meshed. Enquiries are being made. 17. The two supposed agents of the ez-Shah (paragraph 6 of Diary No. 19) are said to have* returned to Astrabad via Kuchan. A watch was kept for them here, but they seem to have avoided the city on the return journey. 18. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. Baki Sultan’s men at Hauz-i-Safid. -A caravan has been robbed by Mir 19. News from Herat.—The family of the Indian doctor have arrived at Herat, and have been given quarters in the Chaha'r Bagh. 20 . The Naib-ul-Huhumah is taking a special census of the population of the city, apparently for military purposes. The headmen of all quarters of the town are also directed to submit lists of all men who have done any military service. 21. Yon Gruden and his servant returned to their quarters in the early morning (paragraph 26 last week). The Naib-ul-Hukumah has now given strict orders that none of the German party should ever go out without an escort, even for ashort walk. The object of this apparently is that he should always know where they go and what they have been doing. 22 . On the 18th May the Naib-ul-Hukumah was visited by Kazim Beg who informed him that the Germans were now advancing in France with the object of forcing France to make peace : after which they would have no difficulty in finish ing off the British. The Naib replied that he would never believe that France had made peace until he read the news himself in the papers. 23. Yon Gruden stated on the 20 th ultimo that Wagner and Paschen had gone from Tehran into Russia on some important mission at the conclusion of which they would come to Herat: and that he would then obtain leave and go to his own country. 24. Abd-ur-Rahman, the man who had been sent by the doctor to bring his family from India, has been interviewed by the Naib-ul-Hukumah who questioned him in regard to the treatment he received while in that country. He replied that his movements were carefully watched by the police wherever he went, but h Bi w&lt;lie does not seem to have made any complaint. He says that whenever asked by British officers how the German party were treated in Herat he replied that they were well looked after as a British party would be in similar circumstances ♦ 25. According to Kazim Beg’s servant Asghar the former has recently received a letter from Russia giving some account of the general state of affairs in the country at present: among other details it was said that fierce fighting had been resumed between Russians and Austrians in various places : that the Turks had helped the Caucasian Muslims to defeat the Armenians of whom they had killed’ a large number and that a very senior Turkish officer was shortly coming td Turkestan to make some arrangement with the Turkomans. 26. News from Turkestan and Transcaspia. — It is said that the Amir of Bokhara has accepted all the fresh Bolshevik demands, and that the Bolsheviks have withdrawn their forces to Tashkent. The Amir has reduced his force to its normal strength. No definite news from Baku; but Armenians are coming across the Caspian in small parties. * ^ W. G.

Persian officials. —The Governor General has recovered, and was able to take part in the ceremonies held yesterday to celebrate the Shah’s birthday. 1 hope to see him this afternoon on business. 2 . M. Sjoeberg (paragraph 2 last week) called at the Consulate on the 6 th. He appears to be friendly, and gives the impression that his sympathies are rather with the allies than against them. r l he democrat designs in separating the two bodies of police had for their object the retention of the present democrat and pro-German superintendeot of police as independent of M. Sjoeberg who does not ^ wish to retain him. I hope to settle this matter with the Kawwam to-day by insisting upon the dismissal of the superintendent. 7 ^ 3. Our friend the Dabir-us-Sultan left to-day to take up Ins appointment as Governor of Sabzawar, armed with instructions from the Governor General to send all escaped enemy prisoners passing through that place to Meshed and not to Tehran. Shahzadah Shuja-us-Sultan has come in to Meshed from Sabzawar, but I hear that he does not wish for the Governorship of Kuchan (paragraph 1 of Diary No. 21). j &amp; u 4. Shahzadah Murtaza Mirza (paragraph 17 of Diary No. 18) has returned to Meshed, apparently against the orders of the Kawwam, who is not pleased with him. He is not likely to receive any further employment. 5. Persian affairs {local).—His Majesty the Shah having sent special orders that the money intended to be expended in connection with his brith-day celebra tions this year should be spent on famine relief work, no state dinner was held on the 7thinstant; but the Governor General held the usual official reception m the morning and a garden party was given in the afternoon in the public gardens which was attended by many of our officers. r 6 . The editor of the Chaman has been arrested and deported by the Kaww am-us-Sultanah for publishing an article criticising his selection of members for a local Municipality which is in course of organisation. This measure was taken while the Kawwam was indisposed, and I have not yet learned from him how it is that the cm^‘-democrat organ was singled out for punishment. 7. Persian affairs fereweraQ.—Certain police officers who were following M. Sjoeberg to Meshed from Tehran were attacked and plundered by thieves near Sabzawar, and all their property including arms and ammunition was carried off. It appears that the miscreants in this case were the sowars of Aziz-ullah Khan Turshizi. Steps are being taken against them. 8 . Bajgiran is again threatened by Kurds and Turkomans from the Askabad direction. M. Spinella (paragraph 6 of Diary No. 18) has not yet arrived here. The expedition which was to have been sent against Shuja-ud-Daulah has been delayed by the illness of the Kawwam, but the troops are now being prepared for despatch. ° 9. British affairs.—The usual garden parties to celebrate the birth-day of His Majesty the King-Emperor were held on Monday and Tuesday, the 3 rd and 4th instant. The Govenor General was not able to be present on account of his illness, but the Karguzar attended, this being the first time he had left his residence for nearly six months. He now seems to have recovered, but is very weak. According to custom the first party was for the Government officials, and the second for merchants and British subjects who had not attended on the previous ‘ f iV '■ &gt; ** 3 • . Il'l IhI t , 1 ; !' : 10 . There is unfortunately a lack of transport in Sistan, and our trade is suffering temporarily in consequence. We are doing what is possible to send down animals from here, but this is the time at which camels go out for a few weeks rest and grazing. The value of the goods which paid duty at the Meshed Customs office last month amounts to rupees 200,000 nearly. 11 . Shahzadah Murtaza Mirza (paragraph 4 above) is reported to have done what he could recently to prevent the acquisition by us of sowars for our levy corps. The Hazara Chief Ghulam Shah, however, has already sent 16 out of 75 promised, and is engaged in collecting the remainder. 12 . Captain Teague-Jones and Lieutenant Ward (paragraph 11 last week) have left for Kuchan to enquire into the position there, which is still obscure as regards the “ Commercial Mission ” (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 19) and their relations with escaped prisoners and enemy agents. 13. Russian affairs .—The trouble between my colleague and his Caucasian fellow-subjects is coming to an end. Mir,Murtaza, the Caucasian leader, called upon me on the 6 th instant to complain of a threatening order to attend the Consulate which he had received from M. Nicolsky. I advised him to comply with it, promising to discuss it with the Consulate and to let him know the result. This I did later in the day, and was told that the order was made out in accordance with the law. I reminded my colleague that his present strong position was owing to our action on his behalf, and suggested a more conciliatory attitude on his part towards the Caucasians. This he undertook to assume. 14. The prisoner Meshedi Ghulam (paragraph 13 last week) was sent direct to Khaf, apparently to avoid any trouble which might be caused at Turbat-i-Haidari by M. de Beauvais who had induced the Russian Vice-Consul to demand his atten dance at the Consulate to answer enquiries regarding the disposal of his business at Meshed, etc.; such interview being quite unnecessary in view of the fact that Ghulam was from Meshed and my colleague had already asked me to obtain answers to similar questions through the Officer Commanding our troops at Turbat. The answers have since been telegraphed by the Officer Commanding at Khaf, and communicated to the Consulate-General. 15. The Turkomans who wished to emigrate into Persia from Russian Sarakhs (paragraph 14 last, week) have been told that a reply will be given to them later, pending which they should occupy themselves in gathering in the approaching harvest. f 6 . Persian and German intrigues .—The Governor General, having been asked by his Government whether the report they have received that he has handed over the prisoners mentioned in paragraph 13 of Diary No. 19 to us, is true, has replied that it is not; and he asks for instructions regarding the procedure to be followed in future, remarking that several provincial Governors, notably the Chief of Bujnurd, demand the payment of expenses incurred in connection with the enter tainment of such persons. 17. From the conversation held at the democrat meeting this week it is evident that advantage was taken of the Kawwam’s indisposition. It was suggested that during the approaching month of Ramzan special preachers should be ap pointed to preach against the British, and to urge the people to combine to turn their troops out of the province, and the proposal was accepted by the majority present. An attempt has been made to effect a reconciliation with the Azarbaijan community in the city, but this was not successful, the democrat messenger being sent about his business. The democrat leaders then decided to request the Kawwam-us-Saltanah to arrest and deport some Azarbaijanis, but nothing has come of this up to the present. 18. The Dabir-us-Sultan (paragraph 3 above) has promised me that he will send in to Meshed the four Austrian escaped prisoners now at Sabzawar, without delay. Those in confinement here are carefully guarded, and the general condi tions of their incarceration seem to be considerably worse than those of prisoners in India for example.19. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —It was at first thought probable that the turbulent Taimuri leaders Mir Baki Sultan and the Ilbaigi Kaudani would refuse to accept the new Governor Shahzadah Jalal-us-Sultan, but they have come out to meet him and shew a disposition to be submissive. It is to be hoped that the Barbari Chiefs will do likewise. 20 . News from Karaiz.—Om Agent left for Khaf on the 22 nd May, to take delivery of certain grain purchased there for the troops. 21 . News from Herat. —Ghulam Basul Khan, the Agent of Hisam-ud-Daulah, has returned to Herat to receive certain stolen property (turquoises, the property of British subjects). 22 . A messenger from Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Sistan and Kainat, has come to Herat. He is believed to have brought letters and presents for both the Naib-ul-Hukumah and Naib Solar. 23. Nasrullah published on the 26th May the news that a letter had been received from Wagner who has written to say that he will return to Herat as soon as he has completed some work that he had undertaken in connection with the re-establishment of order and good government in Russia. This work he has taken up at the request of the Russian authorities. 24. The arrival of four officers, said to be Russians, at Chihil Dukhturan is reported to the Naib-ul-Hukumah. They express a wish to enter the service of the Amir, saying that there is no order in Russia and that they cannot live on the amount of work procurable there. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has replied, but the substance of his communication has not yet transpired. 25. Kazim Beg visited the Naib Solar on the 28th. He informed him that T urkish and German troops had reached Russia in large numbers : that they were improving the lines of communication further east; and that they would soon arrive at the Afghan frontier. Kazim added that the Turkomans had agreed to recognise the Sultan of Turkey as their Sovereign, and that the friendship of the Turks for the Afghans was daily increasing. 26. Von Gruden stated on the 29th that the French had made peace, being hopelessly beaten, and that the British would soon have to follow suit. This information was not believed by the people to whom it was given. 27. The Naib Solar visiting Bagh-i-Kartah on the 30th read some newspaper extracts to Maulvi Barkat-ullah and Kazim Beg which gave them much satisfaction. He had, however, previously ordered the servants to withdraw, so that the purport of the extracts is not known. 28. Haji Ahmad, Kazim Beg’s servant, stated on the 31st that his master could not sleep during the previous night for joy at the news given by the Naib Solar, and that he had remarked that the Turkish Government had at last gained their desires.

Intrigues .—Further arrivals of escaping prisoners are reported from Kuchan. Two Turkish officers reached the place on the 15th instant, it is •tated from Tashkent. If this is correct they have probably made their way from Siberia where a number of Turkish prisoners are confined. They are said to be making for Resht via Bujnurd to join the Jangalis, and were entertain ed by the Kuchan Musavat party who collected money for them. On the 22nd instant two German (or possibly Austrian) officers reached Kuchan, and yesterday 5 other prisoners, not yet identified, arrived there. All these persons can reckon on the assistance of the Musavat for their onward journey. The “ 2,000 ^ rifles are now reported to be still at Artik, although from one account it appears possible that 200 may have been smuggled to Daragiz. It is also possible that the total has been exaggerated. The “ Commercial Mission ” continues to excite suspicion. Nothing definite has, however, yet been discovered. They have hired the caravansarai of one Haji Mullah Abdul Hassan, broker of the Russian Bank at Kuchan. Shujah-ad-Daulah has retained the services of a Russian mechanic named Feeder who is reported to have proceeded to Meshed to purchase plant to work in Shujah's “ arsenal ”. It is probable that steps will be taken to prevent his acquiring it at the present juncture. 161. Jstrabad. —A report dated the 9th instant states that 100 Jangalis with 1,000 Turkomans raided Gunbad-i-Kabus and secured 150 breech-loading rifles. A portion of these raiders attacked the Barbari settlement of Fazalabad on the ground that the inmates were British subjects, and looted 130 head of cattle and 60 horses. A rumour was also current that on the 7th instant 1,000 Jangalis had arriv* ed among the Turkoman. Two Gendarmerie officers with 10 men had reached Astrabad. News received at Tehran generally confirms the above exploit but adds that the Turkoman and Jangalis are not particularly good friends, the former being disinclined to trust the Jangalis. General Lavrov and the Russian Consul and colony at Astrabad were reported to be alarmed. It was also stated that Jangalis propaganda w r as making headway in Mazandaran, and that the Gen darmerie were in sympathy with them. 162. Shahrud—The party of 1 German officer and 15 Turks noted last week was subsequently joined at Shakrud by 3 Austrians from the direction of Astrabad. Up to the 15th instant the party had not left. There is much talk at Shahrud in favour of the Jangalis. 163. Damghan .—Sympathy with the Jangalis is manifested at Damghan. Ahul Kasim and Agha Ali Asghar, brothers of the local Rais-i-Tujjar are identified with this and proceeded to Bandar-i-Gaz to arrange communication and arrival of Jangalis at Damghan. All of the above are democrats, and lend themselves to anti-English propaganda. 164. Zorabad. —Looting of sheep continues in this region. The Deputy- Governor has been in communication with the Afghan post at Zulfiqar re a flock of 600 looted near Sarakhs and taken across the Afghan Borden Ner vousness of Turkoman raids on Zorabad still exists. The Jamshadxs have left. An Afghan detachment of a dafadar and 30 savars is reported present at their new post of Ful-i-Khisht. s732gsb 'bi- %2 ilWi;.iiiiiii» *jn*ru*. ||!l |U| ' | K ; , fltV i I ■ I IP '{; ‘g* wml 1 ^ m .,11 IwMfwiM I ■ I iLiiJ 3 ! brill l i ri ’ti It 11 H rM I!;if ii -A 165. Local Affairs, —Meshedi Ghulam Mebdiev, a Caucasian druggist and noted bad character, who lias been acti\ e in pio-Turk and anti“British propaganda, has been arrested by the Governor-General, The differences of the Caucasian community with the Russian Consul- General remain acute. Further developments are dealt with fully in the Meshed Diary of this date. Three Arab officers yesterday presented themselves at this Consolate- General for assistance. Their story, which appears to be genuine, is that they were taken prisoner when serving with the Turks on the Caucasian front up wards of 2 years ago. On learning of the entry of Arabs into the war against the Turks they applied to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Petrograd for assistance in regaining their country (Baghdad) to serve on the Arab side, but the Pussian revolution blocked further developments. They were at first con fined in the Kostrom Government, afterwards being transferred to Novo Niko- laevsk whence they escaped through Omsk, Tashkent, and Kahka, disguised as Persians to Meshed. Their attitude had incurred them much odium among Turkish officer prisoners and their names, with others of the same nationality, had been reported to Enver Pasha. They have been accommodated in the Con sulate premises pending a settlement of their case. Heeat and Afghanistan. 166. Germans and adherents. —Gruden has let fall further remarks concern ing the proximate arrival of “ guests ” of his nationality. He stated that they might be expected from Persia and that his relief would be among them. On the despatch of the report on the 17th instant, Gruden and‘the servant Muham mad Arab were missing from Bagh-i-Kartah, and no one could state where they were. All horses and mules, however, were present. The party has been cor responding further both with Kabul and with friends in Russia. German successes on the Western front are receiving every possible exaggeration by the party. 167. The Naih-ul-Bukumah. —During a visit of some of the influential local mullahs to the Naib-ul-Hukumah they remarked that both Germany and Turkey had profited much in the war by the capture of many cities, but that Afghanistan by her abstention had lost opportunities of increasing her terri tories. The Naib-ul-Hukumah approved the truth of the remark but said that in the absence of instructions from the Amir no such enterprises could be undertaken. 168. Military affairs. —The Naib Salar has detailed 40 officers and non - commissioned officers to instruct the recruits received by the “ hasht-yak (1 per 8 conscription). He has signified his intention of inspecting them in a month’s time and has enjoined zeal on all concerned. Certain voluntary recruits for the cavalry have been put back till it is ascertained whether they will come within the provisions of the “ hashtyak If not they will be accepted for cavalry. The Kotwali infantry battalion is to be brought up to 1,000 men as soon as practicable in order to free purely military units from police work. The Naib Salar has been asked regarding the number of brass guns at Herat and has written to*Kabul proposing that if required for conversion they should he broken up locally and sent as metal to save the escort which would otherwise be required. He is reputed to have stated that 4 batteries are to be sent to Herat from .Kabul. A squadron is under orders for the Bala Murghab frontier in relief. 169. Herat ' Arsenal ”.—The following work is carried out at the mili tary “ mistri kbanah ” at Herat : — 1. Repairs to guns and rifles ; manufacture of ammunition for above. (This seems to be of inferior quality). Shell fuses are now being made experimentally. 2. Wheels for gun-carriages, saddlery for artillery, head-stalls and heel- rope chains. Horse shoes.3. Carpentry of all sorts, including ammunition boxes. 1,200 English-made, and 400 Kabul-made Martinis and 4,000 muzzle loaders are reported to be kept at the Herat Military store. 170. Bokharan a fairs.--* A resident of Herat named Samad Khan is stated to b^ve fought for the Amir of Bokhara against the Bolsheviks at the head of Afghans enlisted by him, and to have sent out men to Afghan Turkistan to bring in further recruits. Of the Nfdb Salar's news-writers one has reported that the Bokharans had defeated the Bolsheviks, and the other that the Bokharans were fighting amongst themselves. Russian Turkistan. 171. Current events.—The report of the renewal of fighting at Bokhara was due to the arrival at Kaghan on the 10th instant of a relatively large Bolshevik force, and the stoppage by them of all railway traffic for 2 days. Up to the present, reports of actual fighting are not confirmed although tho situation was obviously very strained. By some accounts the Bolshevik force is placed at 9 to 10,000 men j in any case it is considerably larger than anv previously despatched to Bokhara. The commander presented the Amir with an ultimatum, the main conditions of which appear to have been the immediate payment of a contribution of 40 million, rubles in gold, the surrender of the Kazi Kalan, Khushbegi, and mullahs concerned in late disorders, and of all impossible things-the production of the bodies of the victims for identification. Other demands are said to have included payment for damage to and loss of income of the railway, the surrender of all breech-loading rifles, of all Afghans, and of &lt;e certain English officers ” fighting for him. He was given 12 hours to make up his mind, but apparently succeeded in obtaining some 10 days grace, during which he would defray the expenses of the Bolshevik troops. The Bolsheviks are reported to possess 6 armoured^ cars and 2 “Balloons” and to have surrounded Bokhara pending the submission of the Amir to their demands. The mixed detachments sent to Kerki and Termez appear to have remained there but the force at Kushk again left for Charjui, returned to Tejen, and once again to Charjui where it was when last reported. It appears to have been used according to the usual Bolshevik methods as a strong flyin^ patrol on the railway. The Arab officers, above mentioned, report seeing a Bolshevik train at the station of Turkistan (Orenburg line) 2 to 3 weeks ago engaged with small bodies of Cossacks. Orenburg was then in Bolshevik hands but there was no definite news of Butov, although bodies of Cossacks were scattered about the country. They state that throughout Siberia, as now in Turkistan, Hungarian and Czech prisoners have been enrolled in the Red Guard of which they constitute the main element. These declare that they will never return to their country, and their hatred for the Germans and for German-speaking Austrians is very- strong. Little was seen of German prisoners and reports from Turkistan do not mention them. It appears probable that their repatriation has been arranged. The “ Askhabad ” of the 3rd instant (just to hand) calls on householders having .Austrians in their employ to order them to report in connection with repatriation, and it seems likely that this measure refers’to such as have not accepted service with the Bolsheviks. It is reported that 1,500 of these prisoners are in the Red Guard at Tash kent and that they have 15 of their own officers. Artillery has been entrusted to them, and actual Bolshevik troops there do not exceed 500 at present. Musulmans at Askhabad and Turkoman at Merv have been engaged and armed by the Bolshevik and despatched towards Bokhara to assist in the event of hostilities. The Perso-Transcaspian frontier is now reported to he somewhat better guarded. Tejen Turkoman under Armenian officers being employed. Meshed; ^ E. A. E.

They said there was no fighting there at present but that the Armenians were still under arms. Two Jewish agents at Baku are said to he in the employ of the Turks. A Russian and 5 Georgians paid a short visit; it was thought that they had been sent to report on the state of the place. There is nothing urgent to report at present. Report from Y. (Fish'd bod) 17th May .—The Bolsheviks have engaged 700 musulmans locally and armed them. They then said that they would have to fight the Bokharans and sent them off E. The contribution of 7 millions rubles has so far not been exacted. Blood money claims for Persians killed at Bokhara form the matter of dis cussion bet ween the Persian Consul here and the Bolsheviks. The latter are demanding the compensation from the Amir of Bokhara. 100 solriers (Red Guards ?) went to Kizil Arvat to demand wheat from the Turkoman there. It is said that on this pretext they have killed a number , of the Turkoman. Armenians these days are bold and aggressive ; one of them recently shot a shopkeeper at the door of his shop for no adequate reason. Report from X. (HtTV) 18th May.—The Bolsheviks troops who had proceeded to Kushk returned here again and went towards Charjui, They were only there a couple of days and repassed this place for Tejen. Their number was as first reported, i.e., 1,500 Bolsheviks and 1,500 Austrians, and they had 6 guns and 20 maxims. Uniform cloth has been sent from here for the Austrian prisoners. 16th May .— The Bolshevik force at Tejen has again repassed this place on their way E. They appear to be patrolling the line, spending a day or two here and there. The Bolsheviks have engaged about 100 Turkoman here and taken them off E. Reports are current that the Bolsheviks throughout Turkistan have enlisted some ^0,000 prisoners of war, but that the Slavs still refuse to joiu them. Matters at Bokhara seem much as last reported. Report from L. ( fibkharci) 15th About 10,000 Bolsheviks reached Kaghan on the 10th instant. They closed railway traffic, and their commander proceeded to present an ulti matum to the Amir, requiring an answer in 12 hours. Their demands were as follows :— 1. The Khushbegi, Kazi Kalan, and leading mullahs in the late disorders to be given up. 2. A sum of 40 millions rubles in gold to be paid up without delay. 3. The bodies of the victims to be produced for identification. The Amir compromised by agreeing to find the troops in rations for 10 days after which he would give his reply. Railway traffic was reopened after 2 days. Russian troops were at Oharjui and other stations on the line, and there are reported to he 6,000 of them at Samarkand. From the latter place I hear that 1,600 men were sent to Termez. If there is again fighting there is little doubt that Bokhara will he completely destroyed this time. I telegraphed you re closing of the line but perhaps my messenger ate the money for the wire./ t ■ J ■ v / ■ 46 CONFIDENTIAL. 14 Ji V t m --} i ■ msv fmm 3 i 5 19.18 j ^ Sistan and Kaia Consulate Diary, No. 20, for the week ending the 18th May 1918.

May 17th—Major Pakenham Walsh, R.E., and Lieutenant Abbott Young, Mechanical Transport, arrived at Sistan from Hurmak. The Imperial Bank of Persia. The specie caravan mentioned in Diary No. 18 reached Dehaneh Baghi on the 14th instant under an escort of Persian camel-sowursYnly. It will cross the Lut to Pahreh under an escort of Regulars and jambazes of the Sistan Levy Corps, news having been received that a raiding party of 150 men under Muhammad Taki Khan and Muhammad Mayar of (Fehreh) has been assembled at Rigan. At Fahreh the caravan is to be met by 100 sarbazes sent out from Bam by the Kerman authorities. Russian Affairs, M. Korentz (see Diary No. 17) left Sistan on the 13th instant and reached Koh Malik Siah on the 18th. He travelled half the distance with one Consulate mail on mule and camel—and continued his journey from Girdi with the next mail. News from Afghanistan.' (1) It is said that a “ German ” has gone to Shorawak to incite the Barech tribe to raid the railway in Baluchistan. ^ . (2) It is reported that an Afghan caravan proceeding to Herat has been loot ed in Zamindawar or Washir. (3) The Governor of Chakhansur has recently arrested and flogged a relative of Abdul Aziz Kudbedani of Daki Dela, I hear from another source that Zabar Kudbedani has been arrested for looting an Afghan caravan, but do not know if the two reports relate to one case. Abdul Aziz has consequently fled into Persia with 6 or 7 households and is now at Lutak, where some of his tribesmen, serving with our Levy Corps, are stationed. He has asked by telephone for an inter view with me and has been ordered to come to Sistan at once. • ^ - - F. B. PEIDEAUX, Lt.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. V. U II 1. Persian officials. —The Kawwam-us-Saltanah has passed Nishapur and will arrive at Meshed on Thursday or Friday. I have exchanged cordial tele grams with him, and he has ordered certain wheat to be sent from Nishapur of which we were in need and had difficulty in procuring owing to ffical opposition. Arrangements are being made for our troops to participate in the public recep tion which His Excellency is to receive. 2 . Persian affairs {local). —The Governor-General has taken action during the past week to provide wheat for Meshed city, and has arranged for the export of several thousand kharwars from Turbat, Turghiz, etc., meanwhile our friend the Dabir-us-Sultan (paragraph 1 , last week) is working energetically, and the supply of bread in the town, although the price is still high, is sufficient for our famine relief work to be carried on with great success. 3. The political position has much improved during the week. Saiyid Muhammad, the Excise Officer, who is one of the most prominent democrats of Meshed, has been summoned to Tehran urgently ; it is believed at my instance ; and this transfer has inspired the remaining extremists with fea.r for their own interests. Meshedi Ahmad, the man appointed to superintend the distribution of grain to local bakers, has resigned his post as a result of a threat to arrest him which was made on account of the forcible detention of a consignment of grain, the property of a British protege ; and his work is now carried on under the direct superintendence of the Dabir assisted by Salar Nusrat, who has been mentioned as a former superintendent of police and a well-disposed person. We are also meeting with less opposition in the matter of procuring supplies for the troops. 4. Twenty-eight members of the band of Zushki and Shikari robbers who were imprisoned in the artillery barracks (paragraph 8 of Diary No. 9 ), were taken out and shot on the night of the 29th ultimo. Their number included the chief, Muha.mm.ad Zabih-u-llah. This leaves about the same number in custody, who will await the arrival of the Governor-General. 5. The question of the reinstatement of M. Kornelis at the Finance Office has not yet been decided, and he is still awaiting developments. 6 . Persian affairs {general). —M. Spinella has obtained permission to leave Bajgiran on account of the disorders prevailing there, and is shortly expected at Meshed (paragraph 7, last week). The Karguzar informs us that, on the arrival of the Kawwam, Sirdar Intisar will be sent to Kuchan to punish Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor, who is known to be the cause of the recent fighting, and to guard the frontier from the Turkomans, who have lately carried off many thousand sheep from the villages of the Baigiran neighbourhood. 7. It is reported that the inhabitants of Shahrud and also of Astarabad are intriguing with the Janglis, to whom they have recently sent messengers. The intrigues of the Janglis in Meshed have met with no success. 8 . British affairs. —Lieutenant Falconer, 28th Light Cavalry, with four Hotchkiss guns, arrived in Meshed on the 29th April, and the headquarters, with one Company of the 19th Punjab Infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Knollys, on the 4th May. 9. The purchase of nine kharwars of wheat for our troops at Nishapur by a party sent there from Meshed for the purpose appears to have aroused some local resentment among democrats, but the matter was settled by the Kawwam during his stay in^bhe town and, as reported in paragraph 1 above, he has caused more to be procured for us. 10 . We have appointed Ghulam Husain Kandahari and Haji Muhammad Husain as British Agents at Tun and Tabas respectively, and one Muhammad •C h: ill r : if ;■ t'v • i 'Iff Ifljl I : 1 If 1 I.f Zaman Khan as Agent at Turshirz. These three have orders to communicate with the Officer Commanding troops at Kaih, reporting to Meshed any action taken. 11. Some satisfaction is expressed in democrat circles in Turbat-i-Haidari at our apparent failure to induce the Baluch Chief Salar Khan .and the Barbaii Saiyid Haidar to supply sowars for our levy corps. Saiyid Haidar, however, is merely waiting for the sanction of the Govenor-General to the supply, and I have no doubt of obtaining that on his arrival. 12. Our famine relief work, which increases daily in extent and effect, is still much discussed and criticised, more particularly by the democrats and religious leaders. The latter seem to be of the opinion that our aims are purely philanthropic, but the former maintain that there is some fell political purpose behind the work. 13. Lieutenant-Colonel Jack, R.E. and Lieutenant Pearce, 8th Yorkshire Regiment, of the Russian Railway Mission, arrived at Meshed on the 3rd instant en route for Tehran. They quitted Baku on April the 19th. 14. The total value of imports from India last month amounts to just over six lakhs of rupees, calculated at 40 krans per 15 rupees. 15. Russian affairs. —The intrigues against my colleague continue. During the past week the Caucasians have published a notice calling upon their communify in particular and Russians in general to boycott M. Xicolsky, mainly on account of his dilatory methods. He called upon me to discuss his position, and in reply to my suggestion that perhaps they had something to complain of in this respect said that he was not to blame, the fact being that since the revolution he could get nothing done by the Karguzari as there was no kmger force behind him.- I have informed Mir Murtaza, the head of the Caucasian community, with whom our personal relations are excellent, that as M. Xicolsky was appointed by a Government recognised by that of His Majesty I would continue to support him until he was replaced by seme other Consul-General also nominated by such a Gov ernment. This message, which was delivered after consultation with my clleague, was well received by Mir Murtaza who has now promised to make what protests he considers necessary in regard to the Consulate by constitutional methods. 1G. The Russian “commercial mission ” from Askabad, mentioned in para graph 11 of Diary Xo. 15, commands considerable attention. Five of the seven members are at Xishapur where they are supposed to be enquiring into trade prospects, and of the remaining two one is in Meshed and the other in Kuchan. There are persistent rumours that the last-mentioned is engaged in some kind of anti-entente intrigue in Kuchan, and I have sent a man to watch and report on his doings. In consequence of the number of escaped enemy prisoners who have passed through Kuchan recently and the favourable position of the town aS a centre for enemy propaganda, I have recommended that a detachment of troops should be stationed there for a time. 17. Persian and German intrigues .— Shahzadah Murtaza Mirza (paragraph 4 , last week) is still at Turbat-i-Haid ri. In view of his recent attitude here, which was not satisfactory, and rumours which were current regarding his intentions in connection with grain contracts already made by us, I telegraphed en clair to our Agent directing'him to ask the Officer Commanding troops atlurbat to arrest the Shahzadah in the event of his interfering with our arrangements, referring to me for orders. Nothing seems to have occurred. 18. The extreme democrat party have been quieter during the past week. At the first meeting of the society a long discussion was again held on. the subject of the occupation of Khorassan by our troops; apparently occasioned directlv bv the arrival at Meshed of the detachment reported last week. Anxiety was expressed, particularly as no action had yet been taken by Tehran in this matter. It was suggested that a disturbance in Meshed city should be organised on a large scale : a selected man from each quarter being appointed to stir up the people against the British, who were really the cause of the shortage of bread. Nothing was agreed\ipon, and at the close of the meeting the proceedings were referred to Tehran and instructions requested from the head society. The same question was again discussed at a later and secret meeting, but no conclusion was arrived at beyond that orders from Tehran must be awaited. 19. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —The dak sowar conveying our Herat post of the 23rd April disappeared somewhere between Fariman and Jimabad, and it is believed that he was murdered by Barbari outlaws : enquiry is proceedings and two men are about to be arrested by the local authorities on strong suspicion of being concerned in the affair. 20 . News from Karaiz. —Three agents of the ece-Shah have arrived on a visit to the Governor of Bakharz, Shuja-ul-Mulk. They invited him to join in a move ment to re-instate their master, and received the diplomatic reply that he would join in anything of the kind provided that all the other chiefs of tribes in Persia did the same. 21 . The arrival at Karaiz of a Russian Vice-Consul is reported. This must be M. de Beauvais, who has since returned to Meshed. 22 . Tne attitude of the Rais-i-Maliyah at Karaiz is unfriendly : he is trying to interfere in the fulfilment of a contract for the purchase of wheat which I had made with M. Cornelis here. 23. News from Herat. —Twelve Baluch families on arrival from Russian territory via Chihil Dukhtur^n have been Sent to'Chakhansur, and a complaint made by them that their property has been plundered by Turkomans is undeb enquiry. 24. Von Gruden is sending to Kabul by a special messenger what he describes as a Communication containing important nev^s which he is afraid to send by post lest it might be lost. It is addressed to a compatriot. 25. Von Gruden called on the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 24th April, and spent most of the time in abusing Kazim Beg with whom he appears once more to have fallen out. Perhaps, as a result of this interview the Naib shortly after refus ed a request from Kazim that his horses might be allowed to graze on the Naib’s private pasture. Kazim in his turn visited the Naib Solar and described to him the ill-treatment he suffered at the hands of the Austrians. 26. Von Gruden has arranged to send the Barbari messenger spoken of last week (paragrah 23) to Sistan via Chakhansur with two letters. His Majesty’s Consul has been informed. This messenger is named Muhammad Sarvar ; and he is to be accompanied by one of our Agent’s men as a guide, so that his capture should not be difficult. 27. A worker in leather to whom Von Gruden has given a packet containing two letters addressed to the Austrian officers, Schreiner and Rybiska-, at Kabul passed on the letters to our Agents who has had copies made. The copies-are somewhat difficult to decypher as they were made by a man who is quite unacquainted with German, but their contents can be made out and will be separately reported. 28. News f rom Turkistan and Transcaspia* —Ten mullas who had been sent by the Amir of Bokhara to solicit help from the Afghans are said to have returned to Bokhara with 5 guns and some rifles and ammunition. The Bolsheviks have as usual levied a heavy indemnity on Bokhara, and it is believed that the Amir is only awaiting a favourable opportunity to reopen hostilities with them. Lieutenant-Colonel Jack (paragraph 13 above) reports that there was no change in the situation at Baku up to the 19th ultimo i the towm is still in the hands of the Bolsheviks and Armenians. General Dutov is reported to have suffered a reverse and to have been com pelled to fall back upon Orenberg, but nothing definite is yet known about this. Meshed \ AV. G. GREY, Jj'ie'utenant-Colonel. £ His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and 'The 4th May, 1918. ) Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C151F.D.—9-6-18—30—M.D.\ f X^xyn [ CONFIDENTIAL. ) kJ * erpci Vi/'- ^ ! / X i j Meshed Diary No. 19 for the week ending the Hth May 1918. 1. PemVm officials. —The^ new Governor General, Kawwam-us-Saltanah, reached Nishapur on the evening of May the 4th, and after a three days’ halt there came on to Meshed, which he entered in state at sunset on Thursday, the 9th. Our cavalry met him outside the town and accompanied him to the city gate, and the 19th Punjabis lined the road on both sides of the Consulate General, along which the route lay to the Ark. 6 Shortly after His Excellency entered the town a curious incident occurred. About three hundred women of the poorer class stopped the procession and approaching the Kawwam’s carriage protested loudly against the apathy of their well-to-do countrymen towards the distress caused by the present famine conditions. They pointed out that the British were doing what their own people should do for them, and urged that some measures should be taken by the local Government. One woman threw into the Governor’s carriage an oil-cake ; and His Excellency is said to have been such alarmed, supposing that it was a bomb. I hope to visit the Kawwam officially to-day after the Indian post has been despatched. 2. The corpses of Prince Naiyur-ud-Daulah and one of his sisters, who died recently in Tehran, have been brought into the city during the week and interred in the Shrine. 3. Persian affairs {local ).—The town has been quiet during the week and bread has been plentiful, thanks to the co-operation of the Dabir-us-Sultan (paragraph 2 last week), though dear, and we have carried on our relief work without inter ruption and with daily increasing numbers. To-day no less than 6,700 persons were ' fed on our premises alone, which is as many as they can accommodate at one time, f 4. Persian affairs {general ).—Shahrud and Astarabad are said to be quiet, but Mazinderan is in a disturbed condition. The ex-Shah is reported to have arrived at Barfarush. 5. The Governor General while at Nishapur ordered that a store of wheat, the property of the late Naiyur-ud-Daulah, which had been confiscated by the Pevenue Department, should be released and sent to Meshed for distribution. He has directed the Postmaster-General to despatch to Nishapur all available post-carts, in order that the grain should be brought in with as little delay as possible. 6. The Agents of the ex-Shah (paragraph 20 last week) have visited the Baluch chief, Salar Khan, at Alyak, and Saiyid Murtaza, a minor Barbari chief, at Kalandarabad : also the Ilbaigi Kaudani. They do not seem to arouse much enthusiasm, but I have asked His Majesty’s Minister for instructions as to what, if any, action should be taken against them. 7. British affairs. —Lieutenant-Colonel Jack and Lieutenant Pearce (para graph 13 last week), and Captain Jarvis (paragraph 123 of Meshed Intelligence Summary dated the 27th April last) left for Tehran on the 8th instant. Lieuten ant Gordon remains here for the present. 8. The case of our missing dak sowar has not yet been cleared up, but inquiries are proceeding. It seems to be certain that he was robbed and murdqred for the sake of what he carried. 9. The formation of a ^ro-British society is in progress in Meshed city : it is f There is a danger now that we may have to suspend operations for a time for lack of funds, which will give the Kawwam a chance to shew his sympathy for his new charge. composed of Caucasians and prominent Persian merchants, and is drawing up its rules and programme in the approved fashion of the democrat and cm^-democrat societies. 4 /10 Russian affairs.--Wy colleague called three days ago to know the result of the communication to Mir Murtaza mentioned in paragraph 15 last week, and was much pleased to hear that it had had a satisfactory effect: he informed me yesterday that Mir Murtaza, in spite of the proclamation calling upon Russian subjects to boycott the Consulate, which he had engineered, had himself asked for the help of M. Nikolsky in connection with a claim against a Persian subject. 11 My man has returned fromKuchan (paragraph 16 last week). The Gov ernor, being in bad odour with the Meshed authorities, is evidently preparing for resistance should it be decided to send an expedition against him, and I hear that 2 000 more rifles have been smuggled into his territory. He befriends the Russian ^’commercial mission ” in the bona fid&lt;?s of which my colleague still professes to believe, but whose movements are very curious although nothing definite has yet been made out against them. It is certain that they are not primarily concerned in the purchase of dried fruits, as a considerable amount of fruit has, according to information supplied to me by M. Delcorde, been re-imported into Persia from Askabad during the past ten days. Several other persons are at present in Kuchan whose'movements are described as suspicious, though the suspicion is rather of a negative than a positive oidei. I have engaged a permanent agent for Kuchan, who will be there shortly, and my recommendation for a detachment of troops is receiving the attention of the General Officer Commanding. ] 12. Orders have been issued by the Persian (rovernment directing that ! rouble notes circulated by the late Kerensky Government should not be accepted, being valueless. 13. Persian and Gennan intrigues.—The Kctrguzari have received a telegram from the Karguzar of Kuchan announcing the arrival and despatch to Tehran of 20 escaped enemy prisoners. Four such prisoners, Turks, have arrived here from Kelat, and are detained in the Ark with those already there. I hope to settle this question with the Kawwam at an early interview. 14. The arrival of 11 more escaped Turks is also reported from Bujnurd, and the Karguzar, in answer to a reference to the Meshed Karguzari, has received instructions to press the Chief of Bujnurd to pay their feeding and travelling expenses to Tehran. I am interested to see what the Chief will do in the light of his letter to us lately received promising to send prisoners here and to inform me of their despatch (paragraph 9 of Diary No. 17 : this letter has been received since then). 15. The local democrats are now in a state of dejection owing to the fall of the Mustaufi ul-Mumalik Cabinet ; they say that now their designs will have to await a more favourable time. They hope to bring pressure to bear upon the Kawwam-us-Saltanah in due course. 16 . It appears that Haji Ali Asghar, the democrat “ inspector ” from Tehran, is, more or less openly, a Turkish agent. He was formerly a member of the Nizam- us- Sc It amah's force which joined the Turks at Kirmanshah. He holds meetings in his house here, but they do not seem to have produced much result. I will press the Kawwam to take some action against this man. 17. A T ews from Herat .—On the 2nd instant the Naib-ul-Hukumah invited the headmen of the neighbourhood to lunch, and rewarded them with khilats for their past services. Before dismissing the company he informed them that one man in every eight of their communities would shortly be called up for three years’ military, service and exhorted them to give the utmost assistance in the provision of the men required. It is not known what this portends. 18. Dissensions among the German party continue : the Naib-ul-Hukumah has again good-naturedly tried to make peace between the conflicting parties, but has not met with much success. 19. On the 27th ultimo the Mihmandar of Bagh-i-Kartah asked the Austrians to let him know the amount of fresh grass they required for their horses, but they replied that they would not feed their animals on green grass as they wished them to be strong and ready to travel at any moment. .20. On the 28th idem the Captain of the guard over Bagh-i-Kartah complained i u l trouble S iven t0 him and t0 public on account of he frequency with which the servants of the German party arrest passers-by on a charge of espionage. 21. the Naib-jd-Hukumah dined with Kazim Beg on the evening of the 29th. hazim attempted m the course of conversation to make the Naib believe that all ne news furnished to him by us was false, but the guest replied that he was con vinced of its truth as he invariably read it afterwards in the newspapers. Kazim mso tried to make out that the whole of Baluchistan was in revolt against the i itish, but the reply to this was that it could not be true as had it been, the Naib would certainly have heard it before Kazim. The latter presented his guest with a German revolver on his departure. 22 Von Gruden stated on the 1st instant that a German merchant had reached hanjdeh, and that his agent would soon come to Herat. ; 23. On the 2nd instant ^von Gruden asked the Naib-ul-Hukumah to provide him with a iresh messenger, saying that the two at present employed were now too well known and might at any time be captured. The suggested one J small of the Ahzai tribe, who is described as 30 years of age, tall md stout clean shaven except for a moustache, of fair complexion. 24. In addition to the letters mentioned in paragraph 27 last week the same worker m leather has supplied our Agent with two more letters, this time in English and written by Maulvi Barkat-ullah to Lieutenant Ruhland, an Austrian detained m Kabul; and some Indian friends, apparently in India. The Maulvi s English is wonderfully good, and his letters are most interest- mg ; copies of them are being communicated to the Government of India and His Majesty s Minister in Tehran. 25. News from Turkistan and Transcaspia.—Thz Amir of Bokhara has apparently declined to allow the Russians to repair the Khaghan-Tarmez railway line ; and it is believed that this may lead to a resumption of hostilities. It is reported that the Bolshevik forces which had been despatched to Tashkent have now returned to Samarcand, Bokhara, etc., which suggests that the rumour of General Dutov’s reverse has some foundation in fact. Reports of Bolshevik troops with guns proceeding to frontier posts indicate apprehen sion of trouble with Afghanistan. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. Meshed : The 11th May 1918. ©. M. Press, Simla.—No. ClolF.D.—]0-6-18—30—E.ACONFIDENTIAL. - '*•. ?y&gt;*rr 1. Persian officials. —Official visits have been exchanged with the Governor General, and in addition I called upon him on Tuesday last to make requests regarding : (1), the prisoners, now 26 in number, confined in the Ark : (2), the Hazara sowars required for our levy corps : and (‘3), the deportation of Haji Ali Asghar, the democrat inspector (paragraph 16 last week). Regarding the prisoners His Excellency made proposals which are under consideration : he assured me that he had no objection to the entertainment of Hazaras, though he could not of course recognise the existence of the levy corps officially : and he gave orders for the immediate arrest and deportation of the Haji, and also for that of Meshedi Ahmad, the suprintendent of bakeries (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 18) who had been obstruct ive to us. The arrest and deportation of the Haji was duly carried out on the night of the 16th, but I hear that Ahmad has decamped. Possibly he may be hidden in the town, but in any case he will give no further trouble. 2. The Excise officer, Saiyid Muhammad, (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 18) has not yet left Meshed, but the Kawwam having shewn that he intends to work with me what this man does is no longer of consequence. 3. Persian affairs (local). —The pro-democrat newspaper Bahar has ceased publication, probably in connection with the collapse of democrat power conse quent upon the change of Government in Tehran and the attitude of the Kawwam- us-Sultanah here. 4. The local committee of the Society of Union and Progress have received a telegram from the corresponding committee at Rasht, urging them to follow their example in taking up an an^-British position, but the society here, which numbers among its members some friends of ours, has not responded. 5. The Governor-General intends to send an expedition against Kuchan, with the object primarily of punishing the Governor, Shuja-ud-Daulah, but also to stop the disturbances and intrigues by which the condition of the district has recently become so bad. He has consulted me in regard to the replacement of Shuja-ud-Daulah, and this question is still under consideration. The Kawwam asked me to procure for him the loan of some rifles from the Persian Cossack Brigade, but unfortunately they have no spare arms, all such having been taken with the Cossacks who proceeded to Shahrud under their Commandant three months ago. As it will be difficult for a Persian expedition to be successful against the Kuchanis (whose Governor has recently become possessed of a con siderable number of weapons) with any prospect of success, armed as the local troops are at present, I am pressing the Kawwam to use us as a threat to bring Shuja-ud-Daulah to his senses. 6. Persian affairs (general). —Grain has come in during the week from the district, and matters have improved : the price of grain having fallen generally. The harvest prospects are good throughout the province, and at Sarakahs this year’s wheat is said to be nearly ripe. There is no other news of interest this week. 7. British q^Vs.—According to a late report received from the Customs Department four more lakhs of rupees have to be added to the total value of British imports for last month ; bringing the total for the month to over ten lakhs, 8. The murder of our dak sowar is coming to light. Apparently as a result of the imprisonment of a Hazara on suspicion, the mail bags, found near a deserted village just off the road along which the unfortunate man had to go, have been sent in. The contents are intact, with the exception of a parcel of gold roubles which had been placed in one of the bags without our knowledge and contrary to orders. The case will be dealt with in due course.9. Russian affairs. —A Russian subject named Shah Muhammad, who is . required at Kuchan in connection with a theft which he committed, has been arrest ed at Askabad, and the Karguzar of Kuchan asks for his return to Kuchan. The matter is being arranged through the Consulate-General in Meshed. 10. M. de Beauvais (paragraph 10 last week) .has been ordered to proceed to Turbat-i-Haidari, there to be attached to the Vice-Consulate. My colleague and I have telegraphed to Tehran pointing out that he should be removed from Kho- rassan, as he could continue his intrigues at Turbat without difficulty. M. Nicolsky did not take his First Secretary to call officially on the Governor General, and this unfortunate mistake has re-opened hostilities between them. Three days ago a meeting, cenvened by the officials of the Russian Bank, to which all the Russian European community were invited, was interrupted by the advent of M. de Beauvais with a party of Caucasians, and dispersed w T ith out having passed the vote of confidence in my colleague with the object of which it had been convened. Mir Murtaza, the Caucasian leader, has, however, promised me that they will raise no agitation against the transfer of M. de Beauvais, and I hear from a secret source that they are now disgusted with the latter for having for drawn them into an intrigue on a personal matter between him and his chief. At the same time Mir Murtaza begs me to help the Caucasians to instil a little energy into their Consulate, and I would be only too glad to do this w T ere it possible, having suffered from the terrible slackness which prevails as-much as anyone else. 11. The Tehran Foreign Office is still considering the subject of losses sustained by Persian subjects at the hands of Russian troops during the occupation of northern Persia by the later, and a fresli reminder has just been sent to Meshed ordering full enquiry and report without further delay. 12. Persian and German intrigues. —It is now fairly certain that the local de mocrats will give no further trouble to us so long as the attitude of the Kawwam (dealt with above) is maintained and the democrat party in Tehran do not again come into power. Many of the democrats here are personal friends of this Consu late, and both they and others are ready to move with the times and their own personal interests. The formation of a joro-British society (paragraph 9 last week), winch is ascribed, probably with truth, to the success of our famine relief work, has much disturbed the extremist party, and the attitude of the Kawwam increases their discomfiture. In this latter connection the following is a precis of replies given by the Kawwam to questions put to him by a deputation of extremists on the subject of us and our troops in Khorassan :— Q- Are you aware that the'British are buying the grain of the coming harvest in advance, and that the result of this will be the continuance of famine conditions in the province ? ^ have heard of this and will give it my attention. No douht the matter will be settled amicably with the British. (/ have already been approached, and it is under discussion. —W. G. Grey.) How long do the Government intend to submit to the presence of British troops in our country ? Do they not see the necessity of expelling them ? H.—The Ministers at d ehran understand this question better than you, and being Persians-dislike as much as anyone the interference of foreigners in their country : but they know that the object of the British in bringing troops to our country is not that they may take possession of it but that they may protect themselves against their enemies. Formal promises to this effect had been given to the Government by the British, and their minds might be at rest. Of course the conduct of the troops in our country will he carefully watched, and anything incorrect at once brought to notice.^ re y? u aw a | re that we had determined to stir up the whole province against the coming of British troops, and only laid aside the intention m view of the fact that an active and energetic-Governor General is coming to Khorassan who will help us in this matter ? A. Such a plan as this is highly objectionable for many reasons. We have not troops which could oppose the British : we cannot even keep our own people in order. You must remember that the times are most anxious; we are threatened with trouble from the lurkomans and Armenians for instance, and the presence of British troops will be useful in helping us to remain at peace and be protected from such dangers. This information is from a. secret source and may be received as substan tially correct. 13.

W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, Meshed The 18th May , 1918. ) His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C174 F.D.—20-6-18—30—B.C.ft.CONFIDENTIAL. q - 1 J Meshed Diary No. 21, for the week ending the 25th May 1918. 1. Persian officials .—The Government of Kuchan is under consideration : the recent conduct of Shuja-ud-Daulah having been such that he can no longer remain in his position. The Governor-General, after consulting me, offered the post to our friend Salar Nusrat, but he declined, giving (secretly, to me) as reasons the weakness of the Persian troops and the impossibility of controlling the Kurd tribes with the force proposed to be placed at his disposial. The Dabir- us-Sultan (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 19) was then offered the post, but he also dec lined on the ground that being himself a large land-owner in the district he could not do justice to the position of Governor. Ultimately it was decided that the Dabir should be appointed Governor of Sabzawar, and Shahzadah Shuja-us-Sultan, the present incumbent, transferred to the Government of Kuchan. This airrangement will work well. Shuja-us-Sultan is a capable man, and with the Dabir at Sabzawar we will be able to stop the passage of escapea enemy prisoners to Tehran via that route. The difficulty of removing Shuja-ud-Daulah has yet to be surmounted. A force is being prepared for despatch under Sirdar. Intisar and it will probably leave some time next week. 2. Shahzadah Jalal-us-Sultan has been appointed Governor of Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam, which is also a satisfactory selection. He is to be supplied with a force sufficient to keep in check the unruly tribes of the neighbourhood. 5. Nusrat-ul-Mulk is appointed Governor of Khaf by orders direct from Tehran. I have no objection to this : Nusrat visited me on the 21st instant, and promises to work with us. 4. The Governor of Tun and Tabas, Salar Arfa’, is to be deposed, and probab ly our friend Shaji-us-Sultanah, for w r hom the Governor-General has promised to provide, will be posted as his successor. 5. Persian affairs (local ).—The price of bread has fallen to six krans, owing to the importation into Meshed from outstations of a considerable quantity of wheat (paragraph o of Diary No. 19, etc.), and suffering from famine conditions is decreasing. Our relief work has been suspended for a week, but it will probably recommence in a day or two as more money has come in. 6. Eight more of the Zushki robber band wxre hanged on the 18th instant. 7. On the same day the Kawwam-us-Saltanah, conversing with the Presi dent of the Council by telegraph, made certain proposals for the good of his charge, among which were the grant of a sum of money to join in feeding the poor and the despatch of a Swede from Tehran for the superintendence of the local and prov incial police forces. He received merely a promise that the Council would consider his proposals, and that a reply would be given later. 8. The Kawwam has prohibited the sale of arms in the town until further orders, and has ordered that for the present the shops of all arm-sellers should be closed. , 9. The editor of the BaJiar has been permitted to resume the publication of his journal upon certain conditions. The first number appeared on the 24th instant and is unobjectionable. 10. British affairs .—I have received a letter of complaint from the Barbari Chief, Saiyid Haidar, regarding the arrest of the man believed to be concerned in the murder of our ddk sowar (paragraph 8 last w T eek). The letter is scarcely polite, and I hear that an agent of the Janglis has been seen in the vicinity of Saiyid Haidar’s village, which suggests that he may have been tampered with. I may find time to visit Jam and its neighbourhood shortly, which would probably be the best course to take in connection with Saiyid Haidar.2 11. Russian affairs. —On the 19th instant a meeting of Caucasians was held in connection with the election of certain members of their committee, and an invitation was issued to all Russian subjects to attend. This w r as accepted by a few Armenians and one or two Russians only, and among the latter was an officer named Antipin who came to Meshed recently in search of work which, as an officer he could not find in Russia. This man, who has unfortunately become invob^ in the intrigues organised by M. de Beauvais against my colleague, was among the speakers at the meeting and in the course of his oration urged the assembly to resist, by force if necessary, the authority of the Russian Consulate as its members belonged to the old regime of Imperialism, and should be expelled. As it appeared that his speech might incite to violence I caused Antipin to be arrested on the 20th, and he is detained in a room in my office specially prepared for his reception ; and, with the approval of His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran and by desire of the Russian Minister will be conducted to Askabad and warned not to return to Persia. Our prisoner, although very bitter against M. Nicolsky and the majority of his countrymen, is on the best of terms with us notwithstanding the fact that we are responsible for his detention. On the 21st I received a deputation of the Caucasians headed by their leader, Mir Murtaza. I supposed that they had come to ask for the release of Antipin' but found that the object of the visit was to assure me that they had no part in the matter for which the latter had been arrested and did not approve of what he had said. I pointed out to them again the necessity of making no protest against the transfer of de Beauvais, and renewed my promises to urge my colleague to listen patiently to their complaints after his secretary had left Meshed. We have since arranged that the Karguzar and I are to adjudicate between the conflicting parties, and I have hopes of an amicable settlement. M. de Beauvais leaves for Turbat on Monday. 12. On the 24th instant the Governor General arrested a Caucasian named Meshedi Ghulam, a chemist, who is well known as a pro-Turk and generally as an undesirable person. He had recently shown signs of a desire to tamper with the fidelity of our troops, and the arrest was a sequel to a reference made to His Excellency by us, although we had not yet actually asked for such measures to be taken. s My colleague made a formal protest, which was removed on my explaining the circumstances to him, and he now asks that we will deport Ghulam to India for the period of the war. He is accordingly to be made over to us for deportation. 13. Persian and German intrigues. —On the 20 th three Turkish officers arrived at Khakister, and were handed over to the Governor. They reached Meshed yesterday, and prove to be Arabs from the Baghdad vilayet. Having deposited their effects in a caravanserai two of them came to this Consulate and informed us that they had fought for the Turks under pressure only and were overjoyed to think that their native land was now delivered from Turkish misrule. One of them remarked that he had had no objection to fight the Russians, though to fight the British was not to his liking. These men are detained here, pending a reference for instructions. ^ 14. The Kawwam has promised to write or telegraph directing all provincial Governors to send all escaped prisoners of w r ar to Meshed, as stated last week: and the hoieign Office have telegraphed for a statement of expenses incurred in connection with such persons. The Chief of Bujnurd. has, unfortunately, not yet acted in accordance with his promise to us in this matter. 15. From Persian sources we hear that a number of Germans have arrived at Pair]deh x \a Russia en route for Afghanistan, where they are to intrigue against the Allies. We will doubtless receive confirmation of this from our Herat Agent should the report be correct. 16. The Karguzar has received a telegram from Tehran informing him that the German Legation have called for an account of the commercial transactions of one Kaufmann, a German petty shopkeeper of Meshed, who was departed by the Russians two years ago.Intelligence Summary No. 16 for the weelc ending the 20th April 1918, Kiiorasan and North-East Persia. 114. British Force —Two platoons of the 19th. Panjabis are expected here from Turbat-i-Haidari in a few dajs. 115. Escaped prisoners .—The situation regarding Austrian prisoners of war escaping into Persian territory is extremely unsatisfactory as the Officer Commanding, Persian Cossack Division, is unable to undertake any arrange-* ments to arrest them en route. 5 more Austrians reached Bujnurd on the 3rd instant, 3 more have arrived at Kuchan, The latter, of whom one is said to be a German, are stated to be professional men. The total of 20 reported last week to have reached Kuchan appears to have been exaggerated, and 12 to have been the correct number. The 9 Austr'ans here have been transferred from the Karguzari to the Ark, a fact which considerably increases the difficulty of keeping a watch on their departure. It is thought not unlikely that they will be sent out with the crowd of savars and persons who will shortly proceed to meet the new Governor-General, and if this is done it will effectually dispose of any chance of our laying hands on them as the posse is likely to proceed further than* Sharifabad where our cavalry post is stationed. 116. Commercial mission .—The individuals noted in last week’s Meshed Diaiy and vouched for by the Russian Consul-General left Meshed on the course of the week for Sabzwar. So universal is the suspicion aroused by their under takings that, paradoxical as it may appear, it is perhaps the best guarantee of their bon^ fides, for it is difficult to imagine that the Germans should have a hand in a venture apparently so ill organised. They purport to be the representatives of the All Russian Central Alliance of Supply Societies, an undertaking which is said to have existed at Moscow and other centres for some 10 years under another style. The head of the delegates—Yulusov—occupied a position in a bank at Samarkand, the next— a Pole named Byelkovich—was Superintendent of the Askhabad museum, and the third—a Jew named Khabat—kept a small sta ionery shop at Askhabad. The remaining 5 members, who were in the background, are said to be Jews, several of them being students. No smgle one of them appears in any way qualified to act as a member of a serious commercial mission. They state that their object is the purchase of dried fruits, but Khabat when ollered by an Armenian merchant passing through Meshed, with whom he had been acquainted at Askhabad, a largo consignment of this commodity already at Askhabad and at far more favourable prices than are available locally, refused on the ground that they are only looking about them. They have hired a oaravansarai at Kuchan and 2 at Meshed. 117. Local n/Tubs.—-Sardar Intisar has again resigned the functions of acting Governor-General and these have been entrusted to the Karguzar. So encouraged were the local democrats by this circumstance that they have arrested Saham-ul-Mulk, one of the principals of the opposing party. Assistance to the Engli&gt;h is cited as his main offence. It is probable that if this action passes unchecked they w ill proceed to further arrests of their political opponents aud will entirely dominate the local situation. The bread question goes from bad to worse. Ptoads as usual continue unsafe. Bajgiran and neighbourhood continue disturbed and a custom-house in the vicinity has been looted, Herat and Afghanistan. 118. Germans and adherents .—The British Agent at Herat reports the receipt by Kazim Beg of a letter from Mohendro Partap from Bala Murghab, iu which the writer signifies his intention of visiting Herat. As regards the last item he awaits further confirmation. s 443 gsb(The German party continue their propaganda which now takes the form of announcing the arrival of a Turko-Germau force in Afghanistan via Russian territory. A remark left fall by von Gruden appears to foreshadow the arrival of other Germans or Austrians at Herat. 119 Turkomans —A yhfwm hns been received from Rahul ordering the despatch thither of the two Urganj Turkomans who were reported to have requested help against Russia. There appears to be reason to doubt the genuine ness of at least one of these individuals. 120. military affairs —The Raib Salar has announced his intention of proceeding on a tour of inspection of the frontier. He recently stated in Dar- bar that ^the Amir had offered a reward for a receipt for^the manufacture of smokeless powder at Kabul ** such as was used in Geimany , but that hitherto no result had ensued. | A jamadar and 26 men have left in relief for Ghurian, orders having been given for the two guns and the artillery detachment to return to Herat. All officers of the rank of captain and under are ordered to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the mechanism and use of the magazine rifie. 121. Bemonnts. —2 officers, provided with 15,000 Kabuli rupees, have been despatched to Maimanah to purchase horses. Russian Turkistan. 122. Current —According to later reports of recent events in Bokhara the Bolsheviks, although originally in small force, appear to have had the better of the fighting all through entirely on account of their artillery, which outranged that of the Bokharans and of their machine guns. Far from their agreeing to the Amir’s terms they have imposed, by some accounts suffi ciently, and by others exceedingly, severe terms upon him. All accounts received so far agree that the direct cause of the fighting lay in the intrigues of the Union and Progress Society of Bokhara with the Bolsheviks, the former having bribed the Bolsheviks to place conditions of reform before the Amir to which it was known that he would not consent. Demands for a pecuniary and grain contribution and for reduction of his forces were also made. The Bolsheviks originally at Kaghan numbered no more than 500 but had 4 guns and machine guns, and in the first few days fighting which occurred between Kaghan and Bokhara exacted a very heavy toll from the ill- organised Sarts with these. It is said that they would then have been com pletely victorious but for the presence with the Amir of some 500 Afghans whom he had obtained locally and who furnished a much-needed stiffening. The Bolsheviks who were running short of ammunition and were disquieted by reports of the destruction of tho railway to the east of them, collecting all the Russians at Kaghan, succeeded in withdrawing towards Samarkand repairing the line sufficiently for passage as they passed. On being reinforced from Samarkand and Tashkent they again fought their way back to Kaghan bom barding and capturing Karminah eu route, the Amir fleeing thence to Bokhara. It was during their temporary absence from Kaghan that many atrocitvs were committed there by the Sarts, Persians, Barbaris, and Caucasians being killed on the assertion that they had assisted the Bolsheviks. Old Charjui was destroyed in much the same fashion, the Bolsheviks at Charjui originally numbering 400 with 2 guns and some machine-guns having succeeded in repairing the line towards Merv sufficiently to receive reinforcements of 1 gun and 200 men (including 100 Turkoman), after which they shelled old Charjui, the population fleeing. On the following day the Bolsheviks, collect ing every available vehicle looted and burned the town. As an act of revenge the Sarts massacred the Russians at Karakul, to which town the Bolsheviks eventually worked tluir way and bombarded it. The Kazi Kalan and Mullahs appears to have been the leading spirits in the “ Jihad,” the Amir, perhaps influenced by his fears, having been inclined personally to moderation. s443gsb *The C. A. line as far as Kaghan lias been restored from the east and the damage done to the Termez line on the section Kaghan Karshi repaired. It has been reported that the section Kaghan-Charjui has now been restored, work having proceeded from both ends, but at any rate communication has not been renewed as yet. The Bolsheviks are holding points on the line in strength and are also reported in strength at Kaghan. It is the general native opinion that they will not be satisfied without the rich loot of Bokhara. The terms imposed on the Amir are generally that he should hear all expenses of repair to tho lines, should supply 200 wagons of grain, and should pay a very heavy contri bution in coin. Far more stringent terms have also been reported but I await confirmation or otherwise of these. It is now stated that the Amir received no support from Khiva, and it is possible that the Turkoman contingent which fought for tho Bolsheviks were mistaken for Khiva n Turkomans proceeding to the Amir’s assistance. Tashkent is reported to he in a bad way. Little attention is paid to the Bolshevik commissioners, and anarchy is rampant. |lb, flour is allowed daily and natives there are stated to be dying 44 like flies ” of starvation. Trans* caspia is relatively quiet, but the natives state that throughout Turkistan “ no men is master of his life or his goods as soon as night has fallen ”. The manager of the Banque d’Escompte here informs me that British troops are eagerly awaited at Ashkabad where the uon-Bolshevik Russians are wondering at their delay in arrival. Communications remain very difficult. A telegram despatched from Merv on the 1st instance announcing the Bokharan peace reached me on the 18th instant. I have just received one from Bujnurd dated the 7tli instant stating that 11 Austrian prisoners had been despatched to Tehran. It had lain for 12 days in the Telegraph Office here. (Both apparently referred to other matters) An agent left about months ago to collect reports. In common with other travellers in the post-wagon he was robbed of all he had a few miles from Meshed. On second venture he was robbed on the C. A. Railway. He was seized at Kaghan and had the narrowest escape of being killed by the Sarts. and was again robbed on the way back here, his companion being killed. Of all except the robbery in the train I have corroborative evidence.® A second messenger was seized by the Bolsheviks at Charjui and narrowly escaped being shot as a Sart. Meshed ; E, A. F.

Khohasan and Nobth-East Persia. 4- til 123. 2 platoons noted last week duly arrived under command of Lieutenant Hart. Captain Lothian, 28th Light Cavalry, has arrived from Turhat i-Haidari. Captain Jarvis, Manchester Regiment, and Lieutenant Gordon, London Regiment, arrived on the 21st instant, from Petrograd via Tiflis, Baku, Krasnovodsk, and Kahka, having been unable to proceed to Tehran from any of the southern Caspian ports. 124. Escaped prisoners,-—Eowx Austrian prisoners left Semnaa for Tehran on the 22 nd instant. Twelve escaped prisoners recently left Bujnurd for Sabzvar via MianabaL' One of these was a doctor who received a fee of 50 tomans for attending the wife of the Sardar of Bujnurd. The three mentioned last week at Kuchan have also left for Sabzvar via Mianabad. This course was apparently adopted after consultation with 2 members of the “ commercial mission ” who had returned to Kuchan from Sabzvar by this route. It is evident that the Sardar of Bujnurd, Shujah-ad- Haulah, Governor, the Karguzar, and specially the Rais-i-Nazmiah of Kuchan, as well os the Governor of Sabzvar, give all assistance in their power to escaped enemy prisoners in reaching Tehran. The last-noted, Shahzadah Shujah us* Sultan, a member of a family of well-known democratic sympathies, is also reported to forward as expeditiously as possible messengers of the German party between Tehran and Afghanistan. The Karguzar and Rais-i-Nazmiah of Meshed with Sab z ad ah Hajji Murtuza (brother of the Governor of Sabzvar) have been consulting as to the expenses necessary towards keeping the Austrians prisoners here in food, cigarettes, etc., during their journey to Tehran. 125. Intrigues —Kuchan is reported to be rapidly becoming a hot-bed of pro-Turkish intrigue. A Ganjabi Turk named Yunus, employed by Nobel &amp; Co , and one Jamil Beg Nasirbekotf are the leaders in propaganda. They belong to the “ Musavat *’party, and have been recently joined by some 10 Caucasian Turks from Russian territory. They are hand in glove with the Persian officials, and democrats of Kuchan. The Khans and democrats of Kuchan are arming themselves with German and Russian rides, the arrival of a considerable quantity of which was noted in a recent summary. They are still on the look out for rides for which they are prepared to pay well. Shujah-ad-Laulah, Governor of Kuchan, has recently engaged or called up some 500 savors. The reason of this is not at present known. A report from Semnan states that a Turkish officer now at Tehran is pre paring to leave for Afghanistan, but that his movements depend on the nature of the Persian cabinet in course of formation. A telegraphic reference on this matter has been made to Tehran. 126. Local a^rs.—Kavvam-as-Saltanah has reached Sabzvar on his way to Meshed. The supply of bread becomes increasingly difficult and the death-rate from hunger is high. During the week minor disturbances owing to this scarcity have occurred, involving the firing of shots and injury to passers-by. It is evident that the period up to the receipt of the coming harvest will be a very critical one. Good rain has fallen during the week and harvest prospects are so far improved. 4 \ \ s477gsbi|!P. '■ it Ih, ■ A small party of Russian officers and soldiers with 8 fourgons passed Srmnan from the direction of Tehran on the 9th instant. They recently passed through Kuclian for Askhabad, having apparently travelled by Mianabad. The u e of this route, as avoiding Meshed and any point occupied by our troops, is specially indicated for escaping prisoners, enemy agents, and other suspicious characters. n The Consulate post for India via Herat appears to have been looted, the dakrider bearing it having failed to reach Sangbast. Enquiries are in progress, but it appears that the rider may have been prevailed upon, contrary to all orders, to accept the carriage of gold rubles for private persons to Afghanistan, a sufficient inducement to robbers should the fact have leaked out. Herat and Afghanistan. 127. Qerm&amp;ns and adherents .—There is no further news of Mohendro Pariap. The German party have received letters by the hand of a Barbari from Persia and it is expected that the man will bo despatched with a return message. His description is : medium height, no beard, mole on left cheek. The mules of the party have lately had their grain ration increased, and purchases pointing to a journey are again reported. The speedy arrival of a German force at Askhabad forms the chief point of their propaganda. 128. 'Saib Major Khuda Baksh Khan has returned from Panjdeh- to Bala Murghab widi the report which the Naib Silar had ordered him to obtain. He has also made numerous purchases for his chief, including a good carriage and has been ordered to return to Russian territory for further purchases, and presumably further information. 1-9. Military affairs. —Handbooks, including instruction in entrenching, have been received from Kabul and distributed to all concerned. • Promotions have been made in the artillery, following on an inspection by the Naib Salar. Russian Ttjrkistan. 130. Current affairs. —A particularly interesting moment in contemporary Turkistan history appears to have been entered upon, but the conclusion of the matter is so far difficult to foresee. There appears to be no doubt that General Dutov, with the help of Ural Cossacks, has retaken Orenburg and is advancing on Tashkent, although the extent of his progress is so far uncertain. The “ Ashkabad ” contains a fervid appeal to all good revolutionaries to unite in shewing a firm front to the counter-revolutionaries and “ Hutovites ”, and some 3,000 KM Guards from around Bokhara with artillery and machine-guns, and all possible reinforcements from Samarkand and its neighbourhood, also with ordnance, have been despatched towards Tashkent. The Bolsheviks have also secured the services of Turkoman from Ashkabad, Merv and Charjui to oppose the Cossacks, by heavy payment. It would appear unlikely that they would be in a position to secure a considerable number of the Turkoman, as from all accounts the hatred of the Turkoman as a class of the Bolsheviks and their methods is very great, but high pay and the prospect of loot at the present time of accute want would doubtless furnish a percentage of broken men of these tribes. Incidentally Captain Jarvis and Lieutenant Gordon on their way from the Caucasus heard a rumour that Kornilov had crossed the Caspian and with Kirghiz recruits was on his way to join Dutov. Should this be true it would have a most important hearing on the situation as Kornilov—part of whose service was spent in Turkistan—enjoys the very highest reputation among the Turkoman. On the other hand Transcaspia is much disquieted by echoes of the fighting at Baku between the Bolsheviks and Armenians against the Musulmans, of which according to latest information, the latter, being in superior numbers s477gsbs irrat B-.:a-:-3-ie-.c cp i T^rk« a a J«?i° ( n C “ t ° w® aku su PP lles - are getting the better. Caucasma Turks are said to be circulating among Turkoman encampments with the obiect 0 inciting their inhabitants, Armenians in Transcaspia are exceedingly nervous especially at Merv, where they have bribed the Bolsheviks to isfne to them c-ra arms, and Caucasians themselves in Transcaspia are also afraid of Armenian ac ion.

The total there now is 9 Austrians and 7 links 3 suspected Turkish prisoners have reached Kuchan, and among recent arrivals there is a person supposed to be a Turkish officer. These 5 receive assistance from Caucasian Turks in the town and from the Jew Khabat a member of the “ commercial mission”. 133. Intrigues. —Pro-Turk propaganda continues both at Meshed and Kuchan, one of the exponents here being Hajji Baba, a brother of Yunus Aliev of Kuchan (paragraph 125). The manager of Nobel and Company here, although aware of the activities of Yunus, is unable to take any action as the dismissal of an employe must under present conditions be referred to the union of employes of the firm. One Hajji Ali Asghar Mujahid, son of Hajji Muhnmrnad Jafar of Baku, recently arrived here, having formerly been at Kermanshah. He is reported to be an enemy agent, and is visited at night by the Bxis-i-Kushun, the Rais-i- Nazmiah and other democrats. He spends money freely and has a large corres pondence, part of which is in telegrams—suspected to be in code. He is being watched. Krause, a German subject deported last year on suspicion by the Russians, has returned to Meshed to take up his residence with his Russian wife who had remained here. A number of Caucasian Turks are arriving at Kuchan. It is probable that this is to some extent connected with Musalman and Armenian tension at Baku and in Transcaspia (many of these people are removing their families from Askhabad). At the same time under present circumstances an influx of Turkish' sympathisers to Khorasan is to be regarded with suspicion. 131. Local affairs. —Kavvam*as-Saltanah, who has reached Nishapur, is reported to be taking measures to ensure the despatch of a quantity of wheat from that neighbourhood to Meshed. In connection with his proximate arrival here an improvement in the local bread supply, calculated to impress him with the virtue and diligence of all concerned, has now taken place. On the night of the 29th.30th April, 28 members of the frushki gang of robbers, including their chief Muhammad Zabihullah, were taken out and shot, their bodies being subsequently exposed on the Ark square till mid-day. It is said that certain of the townspeople hurried on this execution as awkward revelations of complicity might have leaked out on the arrival of the new Governor-General. Bajgiran continues very disturbed, and the possibility of the Customs staff there remaining at their post is in the balance, and depends on the efficacy of measures of protection which the local authorities may be in a position to take. Two Armenian merchants were recently murdered on the road there either by Kurds or Turkoman. The practicability of one tribe throwing the blame on to the other will doubtless contribute to the number of such outrages. A report from Astrabad dated the 18th ultimo states that the Turkoman are now very troublesome round Gunbad-i-Kabus and Hassan Quli. Russian settlers in that region are hastily disposing of their property and leaving for'w*.* HMMI L ri ■f f Russian territory on that account. 100 Persian savars had arrived at Astrabad, apparently with'the object of recovering revenue, and it was rumoured that aiiwther 500 were to come hut for wliat purpose was not known. There was no mention of Jangali, of whom, however, rumours have been rife. Complete anarchy continues to he reported around Sarakhs. Apart from the temptation which present conditions offer to the Turkoman, these people are actually in the greatest straits for food. 135. Hussion ajfairs.—Ihe agitation against M. Nikolski among Caucasians is being revived, Mir Murtaza having despatched a telegram to Tehran stating that owing to the Russian Consul-General’s action the whole Russian colony was exposed to the threat of English machine-gum. Caucasians are warned under various penalties against taking their cases for settlement to the Russian Consulate nnda committee of 4 Caucasians, presided over by Mir Murtaza, has been appointed to settle such matters. A notice to some such effect has since been placarded in the town. 136. Arrivals .—Lieutenant Colonel Jack and Lieutenant British Railway Mission to Russia arrived yesterday from Baku en route for Tehran. Herat and Afghanistan. Pearce of the via Askhabad 137. Germans and adherents .—There is further tfAk among the Austro- Turk party of the arrival of German or Austrian officers apparently via Russia, but nothing definite has yet been elicited. Copies of 2 letters from von Gruden to the Austrian officers Shreiner and Rybiska at Kabul have been sent in. One of these gives a sufficiently correct account of the adventures of Wagner’s party, and confirms suspicions of the complicity of the Persian Governor of Turshiz in Wagner’s escape By his good offices Wagner v as concealed for 8 days in the mountains and despatched by 12 days’ march across the desert to Tehran. The writer was concerned at rumours that the Austrians at Kabul were Leated like prisoners. The second letter deait with photography. Yon Gruden also mentions that he had intended to escape last December, but had abandoned the project. It is now staled that the Barhari Muhammad Sarwar Khan, described in paragraph 127, is to be sent with a message requiring an answer to Sistan via Chakansur. 138. Military affairs .—Little work is reported as the Nail) Salar is taking a spring medicinal treatment. A carriage has been purchased for him in Russia and is being sent to Herat. The officers despatched in search of remounts have reported that no suit able horses are to be found in the Kala Nau and Bala Murghab districts owing to poor feeding, and they are proceeding to Afghan Turkistan to obtain hoi ses. Government horses and camels at Herat are being sent out for grazing. 139. Forage .—Orders have been sent by the Naib-ul Hukumah to the Governors of Kala-i-Nau, Bala Murghab, Kushk and Gulran, to prepare care* fully and to store in each district 300 khartears of hay. Military officers have been deputed to see this properly carried out. Some speculation has been caused, as this is the first time that such a measure has been ordered. Khavanin have also been detailed to superintend supplies at rabats on. the Kabul and Kandahar roads. They will also act as dak riders. Russian Turkistan. 140. Current c/yVrir#.*—Little intelligence of General Dutov’s venture has come to hand during the week, rumours being current here among the Russians that he had been defeated, and even that he had not left Orenburg.gram dated the 30th ultimo from Askhahad had reached me stitirf that fighting is proceeding at Tashkent between the Cossacks and the Bolsheviks and lahst arnra.s here from Russian territory confirm this.

There is at the former place and throughout Turkistan much spotted typhus. Froin a report rendered to General Dunsterville by a Russian officer who had passed through Turkistan it would appear that Mohendro Partap reached Bokhara early m March and was privately received bv the Amir. He subse quently asked the Bolsheviks to assist an Indian rising with men and funds. This officer estimated German and Austrian prisoners remaining in Turkis tan at 15,000, mostly at Taskent and Samarkand. A Commission to arrange their evacuation reached Tashkent at the end of March. He added that 4,000 liberated Austrians, mostly Bosnians conversant with Turkish, had left for Persia for purposes of propaganda. A further statement that Turkistan cotton was to be used for German purposes is interesting in the li^-ht of a recent Boisheviok edict commandering alt cotton stocks. • 1 f !l - PrGpaganda.—In reports received from Turkistan and also fiom arrivals here there is a sensible increase in the mention of German and Turkish f ropagan a. The gist of it seems to be that agents of these governments pervade lurk s*an and bait their hook with the pronrse of stable government which the inhabitants would only too gladly welcome at the present time. It is also stati'd that these persons are at the bottom of some of the contemporary disturbances, and as the lighting of a fire and the taking of the credit forB 633 GSE— 4 '— 13 A 18 —GCP 3 subsequently extinguishing it is frequently part of the stock in trade of the agent provocateur, it seeuis possible that this view may also have some found ation As a rule it is difficult to pin an informant down to concrete facts, but an a^ent at Askhabad reports the presence there of 2 German, 1 Turkish and 3 Austrian officers, and states that two of the latter were conversant with both Turkish and Russian. The suspected agents are in general v er y f ree with their money. There is also reported to be a strong pro-Turkish inclination at Bokhara where propaganda is freely carried on by Turkish agents. The pro- Turk proclivities of the Khushbegi, noted last week, encourage this action. The commercial side of the question has also not been neglected, and there is much talk of German goods at Moscow ’which will become available as soon as the present disturbed conditions permit transport. Persians are stated to be anxious to acquire these goods, which, it is said, will speedily oust Russian and British goods in North Persia. So far the on^ firm of which I have heard in this connection as actually purchasing is that of Ali Agha Dehrudi, the man himself being a resident of Moscov although his partner superintends his business at Meshed! ‘(The Russo-Persian frontier is actually reported to be closed to all import or export for the present.)

Khorasan and North-East Persia. 142. Tiritish force. Headquarters and 1 Company of the 19th Punjabis readied Meshed on the 4th instant. • Lieutenant-Colonel Jack with Captain Jarvis ancf*Lieutenant Pearce left for Tehran on the 8th instant. 143. Intrigues .—Ruchan continues to serve as a passing-point for escaping prisoners, for whom money is collected locally. A German officer and 2 Turk ish officers with 5 soldiers reached that place early in the month from Daragiz, having been provided with cash and letters of recommendation by Raza Khan! the Governor of the latter. They continued the journey a few days later to Sabz- war direct, warning having been sent them from Meshed that it would not be advisable for them to pass through this place. Another Turkish officer has since reached Kuchan. The Musavat party at Kuchan are very active and have established a regular intelligence system both in Khorasan and across the Russian frontier. This is directed towards furthering the escape of prisoners and Turkish interests generally. 2,000 rifles were recently reported to be lying at Artik station on the C. A. railway, awaiting an. opportunity to be smuggled across the Persian frontier. They have now been conveyed to ilaragiz, members of the Musa vat and one member of the “Commercial Mission” having been reported to have been active in this connection. These are described as modern Russian rifles, and they fcrm a considerable addition to the large number already present in N. Khorasan. An interesting side-light is thrown on the reported objects of the “Com mercial Mission ”—the export to Russia of dried fruits—by a report furnished to the Provincial Director of Customs, according to which 10| kharwars oi dried fruits were actually exported during the Persian month of Hamal from Russia (Askhabad) to Persia (Daragiz). Their rejection of consignments of this oo.m« modity actually lying at Askhabad has already been noted. A report that a party of Turks, including 2 officers, had arrived at Anda- rukh, the last stage before Meshed on the Kahka road, proved on investigation, to be false, but an agent has ju«t arrived from Turkistan, stating that be has followed two Turkish officers from -Bokhara to Kahka, whence they intend to proceed to Meshed. 144. Local affairs. —Kavvam-as-Saltanah, the new Governor-General, en tered Meshed on the 9th instant. For some days previous there had been an improvement in the bread supply. It has lately been obtainable at 8 krans per man, whereas recently it could not be bought at 10 or even 12 krans. The normal price is about 2 krans. Irrigated barley should be ripe in about a month. A report from Astarabad, dated the 23rd April, and one from Bujnurd of the 27th April state that nothing unusual has occurred. In the former place there has been some friction between the authorities and the Barbaris settled in the vicinity, and in the latter want of bread is very badly felt. Turkoman continue to causa apprehension in the Sarakhs region. Herat and Afghanistan. 145. Germans and adherents .—The Austrian party have refused to put their animals on green food as they may be wanted for the road at any time. Copies of 2 interesting letters from Maulvi Barakatullah, dated 27th March, to friends—presumably Indian seditionists—at Kabul, and to the Austrian officer Ruhkand there, have been sent in. In the first he develops plans for press propaganda against the English and speaks of the future of “ Eatha^i&gt;ta^.* , S570GSB2 , ^ M i i B ■ '' ■ -vi 1 The second eires sufficiently correct new s of English movements m Persia The letters in full are being sent in by His Britann.o Majesty s Consul-General. 4 fresh messenger has been engaged by the Tureo-Austnan parly for communication with Persia. He is an Alizai named Ismail, about 30 years of a^e, of light complexion, and of stout and tall build. In his letters Maulvi Barakatullah says that he had (27th ^larch) no news . of Hohendro Partap since the latter's departure to Russia m rmd-Eebruary The British airent does not seem to be in a position to confirm the report that Mohendro had reached Balamurghab. 146. Military affairs.-'?™ squadrons of the Chaharyari regiment have been despatched to the Anardarrah and Balamurghab frontiers for relief of the cavalry there.. The Naib Salar has stated his intention of causing the Herat-Kandahar- road to be made fit for motor traffic by means oi corvee. He is much interested in his purchases from Bussia which include a piano, shot-guns, furniture, etc.. No further military activity is reported in the letter to hand which covers dates X1 p to the 2nd instant. This seems to be important in the light of the move-- ments in Russian Turkistan detailed below. As far as can be judged at present all initiative in this respect is on the side of the Bolsheviks, hut owing to difficult communications we have no recent news of Afghan iurkistan.. Russian Turkistan. 147. Curi'ent Events have been moving apace in Tnrkistan. The current of Bolshevik reinforcements which last week was reported to be setting towards Tashkent have now turned in the opposite direction. It appears safe to conclude from this that Dutov has met with defeat at the hands of the Bolsheviks on the Tashkent-Orenburg railway* as whatever events may be expected in Turkistan itself the number of men and guns reported returning westwards could never have been spared had he remained an adversary to be reckoned with. Reliable news of these events his not yet come through, but it is reported that he has been obliged to retreat to Orenburg, and even that Orenburg itself is again in Bolshevik hands. It is also stated lhat Siberian Cossacks are preparing to come to his assistance. In the last few days telegrams have reached me stating that Bolshevik forces with whom were Austrian prisoners, and who were amply provided with artillery and machine-guns, had reached Samarkand, Charjui, and [Merv from the direction of Tashkent with the obvious intention of proceeding to the strong points on the Afghan frontier which in recent months had practically been denuded of their personnel and material. An agent has just arrived from Samarkand, which he left on the 3rd instant, and states that on that date^ 4 trains reached Samarkand from Tashkent. The first contained 650 Bolsheviks, with 14 Q. F. guns and 6 maxims who later left for Termez. The other trains eontained an equal number of men, guns, aod machine guns, hut in their case the proportion was about half Austrian prisoners to Bolsheviks One train proceeoed to Charjui whence the men and material left for Kerki by steamer. Two trains proceeded to Merv whence tliey continued their way towards Kushk on the evening of the 4th inslant. Artillery horses were aBo carried on these trains. Telegrams received from Merv previous to this agent’s arrival contirm the despatch of the trains toward Kuffik, and the fact that Germans or Austrians formed a large proportion of the personnel. The agent states that it was impossible to obtain any explanation of these proceedings at any of the points which he passed, but it is probable that it lies in recent events at Bokhara and in Bolshevik intentions towards that state and its ruler. ^ It was noted last w r eek that difficulties had arisen there over the repair of the Kaghan- Termez line, and that it was feared that these might lead to a renewal of hosti lities. So convinced was the Amir of the danger that he has ordered all foreign native subjects to leave Bokhara before further trouble occurred. A report from Bokhara dated the 3rd instant states that a Russ an engineer with 1 () artificers left for the repair of the Termez line, and tint the whole party hai ffboen killed by orders of the Governor of Guzar, an uncle of the Amir. There was much excitement at Bokhara, one cause beinsf the advance of the Turks in the Caucasus. Afghans and British Poshawari subjects were joining the Amir, and were also contributing money, and on the date of the report the Bokharans were practically in possession of Kaghan. As far as it is possible to judge at the present moment the most likely solution of the Bolshevik movements is that they intend to attack Bokhara, and are sending all they can spare in men and guns to the frontier fortresses to discount any attempt of the Afghans to assist the Bokharans. The Amir of Bokhara himself seems to have been an unwilling agent in the matter, and his hand to have been forced by circumstanc( s. As noted above there was apparentlv no excite ment at Herat, or provision of these events, up to the 2nd instant. The Amir’s troops wer3 being drilled daily by a German and two Turkish officers. Dele gates had been sent from Bokhara to obtain the services of other Turkish officers from the Caucasus. Owing to the departure of Armenians with the Bolsheviks towards Tash kent, tension between the Musulmans and Armenians in Transcaspia had re cently somewhat decreased. An agent reports an interesting conversation in a train between himself and Yusuf Khan, about the most influentbil of the Merv Turkomans. The Khan was asking about the arrival of British troops in Persia, and in speaking of the possibility of the arrival of Turkish forces in Turkistan explained “ God forbid that they should come: if I thought they were coming I would assemble my headmen and proceed to Meshed to seek protection of the British Consul* General/’ The proximate arrival of British troops in Turkistan is frequently roenr tioned, especially among the Armenians. Nothing of interest was reported from Krasnovodsk up to the 26th ultimo. 148. Propaganda .—German agents are reported active in various places. One in particular at Askhabad (said to be a captain) is said to be a very able man and to be active both among the Bolsheviks and the Musulmans. He was recently heard to say that the Amir of Afghanistan had seriously interfered with plans for Musulman union. Be incites both Bolsheviks and Musulmans to violent action and with the latter professes to have adopted Islam. Two other German agents are reported among the Tejen Turkoman who are already, owing to famine, in a most unsettled condition. 5 German officers are reported to have left Merv for Kushk. This may be connected with hints let fall by the Herat party that they might shortly receive an addition to their numbers. In this connection it is reported from Herat that von Gruden had stated that a German trade agent had already reached Kushk. Information has been received through Tehran that a German named Ebert, living at the Persian Hotel at Samarkand is the head of German secret service in Turkistan, and instructions to verify this by all possible means have been given. A look-out is also being kep: for two German agents reported to be on their way to Bokhara from the direction of Meshed. E. A. E.

Kit chan —The Nazmiah department has is&gt;uecl a notice by order of Shujah ad Daulah that, nny person selling grain to the British Government will be punished by a heavy fine and expulsion. A rumour that certain persons—said to be the Commercial Mission ”— fire extensively buying up the coming corps in Kuchan distri t is being investi- g .ted. Khaddu has returned from the direction of Biryusa (Transcaspia) with 4 000 heal cf looted live-stock, but appears to be engaged in hostilities against a brother robber, Tej Muhammad. An expedition from Meshed against Shujah-ad-Daulah under the orders of the Govornor-General is moot* d but the insufficiency of good rifles is likely to prejudice its despatch.

A telegram will be sent to places concerned. 151. Local affairs *—Zushkis at large have robbed the post from Askhabad from which place no papers or letters have been received during the week, 8 malefactors, including members of the Zushki gang, have just been hanged. Prom information given by agents the Consulate Dak-savar appears to have been murdered by Barbaris at the ruined village of Hajiabad, and a portion of the contents of the bags has been recovered. Bobbery of the gold rubles, on information supplied from here, appears to have been the motive, but it may be hoped that further facts will transpire. Herat and Afghamstan. 155. Germans and adherents .—Little news of interest regarding the Turko* Austrian party is to hand. Sidiq Bey has written from Kabul bitterly com plaining of his treatment there. From the copy of another letter frem voa Gru J .en to Kabul it appears that the Austrians at the capital are treated w thpreafc haishness.

Military'Offaire.-TU most important news this week is that the 1 per 8 men conscription measure, which has been foreshadowed for some time has now actually been introduced and is beinc enforced «ith consT,finable strictness. A Government official who opposed the conscription of his son on the ground that the latter assisted him in his duties was deprived of his post effect '‘ r Tt r is hv°m a * t,lis exam P le is said to have produced a great etteot. i t is by means of this measure only that the depleted cadres of existing units could be fiHed, or new units raised, and hy its alption onlv can hi number of men necessaiy to any possible military operations be obtained Conscripts are subjected to a medical examination, and P i,i the first instance battahons. 3,0 S Uti ‘ iSed t0 ““ VaCail0ies exi3tin S 111 the ? h® enforcement of the measure has given rise to the idea among the peo{ le of Herat that Afghanistan is about to enter the war. All artillery horses, except those of one stable, have been sent to the districts for grazing. 157. Equipment.—Kew pistols have been distributed to infantry captains and subadars. Patterns of shell-fuses have been given to the local workshop for reproduction. The work was said to be urgent. t Russian Tuekisian. 158 Currrnt events.—the latest move of the Bolsheviks indicates not 01 “^ 1 at&gt; k °* man power, l )U t a complete disregard of any ulterior conse quences. Ihey have thrown open the ranks of the Red Guard to Austrian prisoners. (German prisoners have not been specifically mentioned in this connection although there is talk of German officers). The offer, which includes rations 10 rubies per day normally and 25 when fighting is in progress, lias been, accepted by | risoners of Hungarian nationality, but Slav prisoners have refused. According to reports some 3,000 men have been added to the Red Guard in this manner. On the 3rd instant 4 troop-trains reached Samarkand from lashkent, each containing about 1,£,00 men, field and machine-guns, and a proportion of horses for the guns. One train which contained Bolsheviks only was directed towards Termez, whither also some heary guns which had been removed were sent about the same time. Of the other trains, the contents of which were the same, hut the personnel in the proportion of Bolsheviks to Austrians, a train-load was embarked at Charjui for Kerki, and two passed through Merv to Kushk. Four 6' guns which were removed from K ushk some months ago were also returned to that fortress. Part of the artillery was in the hands of Austrian gunners with whom were a proportion of their own officers; a German officer is mentioned as among the leaders of the Kerki contingent. The Bolshevik explanation of this move is that they are taking measures to guard the frontier against a possible Afghan or English invasion by occupy ing the strong points on the three main lines of advance. This version is entirely discredited by the native population who, while admitting that the Bolsheviks are desirous of cutting off Afghan support, anticipate a renewal of the Bolshevik attack on Bokhara. That this view is probably correct is r ndered probable by letters received last night from Turkistan and by reports of the most recent arrivals, according to which fighting has again begun in Bokhara, and the railway has again been cut. A proportion of the troops which had reached Kushk, and apparently no inconsiderable one equipped with field and machine-guns, again left towards Charjui. Reports of their further4 * movements nro as yet somewhat uncertain Kaglisn had recently been in Bokharan occupation, but a body of Bolsheviks 400 strong had returned there. It is possible that the Bolsheviks recognised that this detachment was in need of supplementation. The Amir of Bokhara is reported to have warned his subjects, in the event of further hostilities to coniine their energies to killing Russians and Armenians and to spare feliow Musalmans. Threeof his emissaries, reputed to be proceed ing to Khiva for assistance, were arrested at Charjui by the Bolsheviks It is also reported that a German, 3 Turks, an 1 6 Caucasians from B &gt;khara proceeded to Mazar-i-Sharif whence the Caucasians returned to Kerki where trace ot them was lost. A rumour is also current that the Khushbegi of Bokhara had proceeded in disguise to Mazar. There appears little doubt of the retreat of Dutov to Orenburg in the face of superior Bolshevik forces, but no intelligence of any decisive engagement bus come to hand. Askhabad is restless under the threatened Bolshevik contribution of 7 million rubles and the inhabitants of hrosiiovodsk, including Kirghiz, loudly proclaimed their disgust at the Commissaries who were leaving them to Starve, and their desire for the old regime. There have been some minor hostilities between two factions of the Tejen Turkomaus, one of them being supported by the Bolsheviks. 359. Propaganda—There are further reports of the activity of the German “captain” at Askhabad. He was indicated as their officer by Austrian prisoners there but dresses in civilian clothes. Two Turkish agents, disguised as Afghans, held meeting at Kizil Arvat at which they declared that one of the 3 main enemies to Islam the Russians • had been vanquisned, and called for supporters to assist in tue good work of assisting Turks and Germans in bringing about the downfall of English and French. 8 German trade agents (of whom one is a woman) are reported at Askhabad. They have opened shops there in anticipation of the arrival of their goods, and they state that other agents will arrive before long. There are now reported to be about 400 Austrian prisoners each at Askhabad and at Merv. The latter, who are mostly Slavs, refused to join the Red Guard, stating that they were good friends with the Afghans and refused to he drawn into a fight with them. The Bolsheviks told them that in that case they need expect no assistance in rations or money, but were free to go where they liked. Meshed, The 18th M-y 1918. j E. A. E. REEL, Lieut.-Colonel&gt; S640QSB-16-22 6 IS-GCPSSECRET. f HErORT from Krasnovodsk. 2nd May ,— Bolslieviks have threatened residents with bombardment if they raise any disorder. No steamer from Baku for several days. 250 Persians, refugees from Kokand, despatched to Baku by subscription* among local Musalmans. 2nd May (another source).—Nothing to report here. There are 180 Bolshevik soldiers With 2 Q. F. guns. Only about 15 Audrlan prisoners. They teem to have plenty of money. On the initiative of 4 Caucasians the Musalmans assembled at the house of a Caucasian named Abdallah and discussed steps to take should the Armenians commence any aggression. Report from Askhabad. 4th May - 8 German trade agents (one a woman) have arrived and opened shops with a view to commencing business. Their goods are expected shortly as are other persons of the same kidney. ^00 Persians arrested at Kokand were sent to Siberia. They have now been brought here and handed over to the Persian Consul. hhe Bolsheviks have again demanded a contribution— 7 million rubles— under threat of bombardment, 2nd May (another source).—I left for Kizil Arrat as I heard that 2 men were lecturing in favour of the Turks. I attended their meeting. They said that Islam had two enemies; the Russians and the English. The first had been defeated and all should join the Turks and Germans in bringing about the defeat of the second. They were in Afghan dress but spoke Turkish well. I believe they have gone to Tejend, and I propose to follow them. (He wired from Merv on 7th instant departure of 600 Bolsheviks and Austrian or German prisoners with 18 guns and maxims towards Kushk. Also departure of 5 German officers to same destination). Report from Mery. 2nd May-Aziz Khan and Kalu Khan, Chiefs of the Tejen Turkoman, have been fighting. Aziz Khan was their original chief but he fell into dis favour with the Russians for refusing to loot his people of money and horses to satisfy Russian demands. The Russians confined him at Askhabad and put Kalo Khan in his place. Aziz recently escaped and attempted to recover his headship by force, but the Bolsheviks assisted Kalo with 100 men (50 Bolsheviks and 50 Armenians) and a maxim. Aziz was defeated and his house looted. i (He wired on 7th May that Bolsheviks with 10 guns and on 8th May that Bolsheviks and Austrians with 20 guns had left towards Kushk.) Report from Samarkand. 6th May.—On 2nd instant 250 Russian soldiers from Kerhi with 4 Q. F. field guns and 3 maxims arrived. These men are going to their homes. It is rumoured that the Russians intend to disarm all natives of Turkis- tan. Any one calling for a republic will be shot. The Armenians are spread- ing the rumour that British troops are coming to Turkistan. (Hearing that two Turkish and a German agent were at Kaghan he went there land found the 2 k Turks just entraining for W. He followed2 them te Kahka, where they were joined by 5 Tarlcsh prisoners, and to Khaki- stare and then came on here to give us warning so that they might be arrested. He arrived on Uth instant and the 7 Turks on 12th instant He wired from Khakistar on 8th nstant that many guns and maxims had been despatched from Samarkand to Termez and from Ckar]ui to Kerki and reported personally on arrival havingwitnessed the arrival of 4 troop-trains from Tashkent at Samarkand He saw 1 leave for Termez, saw embarkation of men from 2nd tnin on steamer at Charjui, and saw one tram at Merv, another having just left for Kushk On all except the first about half the men were German or Austrian prisoners. No one along the line could explain the meaning of this move) i Report prom Askhabad. oil. Hf n y There are now about 400 Austrians in Askhabad. I have talked^ with somfof them and asked them if they had an officer. They replied that there was one Captain whom I identified with the man of whom I have already told you the agent who professes to have embraced Islam. He goes about in nlain clothes. Both he and the two agents I noted at Kizil Arvat continually declare that German and Turkish forces are coming and are trying to pejsuade all Muhammadans to assist them for the sake of Islam. When at Merv I identifid 2 Afghan spies ihore. I visited Kaghan and saw two full trains of soldiers there mostly Austrians under their own Germans and Austrian officers. They ad Q. . field guns, 12 others less modern, and 4 maxims. Austrian gunners were in charge In the barracks were Balshevik troops. At lashkenfc, the Bolshevik stronghold, a notice has been published calling on Austrian prisoners to join the Red Guard. Hungarians and other Catholics as a class have joined but sdavs have refused. About 3,0c0 in all have joined. At Charjui I saw two trains full waiting to proceed to Kerki. Most of these were Bolsheviks, but among the senior officers was a German captain. According to the Bolsheviks they are holding the frontier posts against a possible Afghan invasion. All people believe this to be a pretext and that the Bolsheviks intend to attack Bokhara and keep the Afghans from assisting. The Cossacks have returned to Orenburg without reaching Tashkent as the Bolsheviks there were too strong for them. The hatred of the Bolsheviks throughout Turkistan is very great. I am trying to get on to Tashkent. Report prom Merv. * 8fh May.—I have verified the number of men who have passed from Tash kent towards Kushk at 4 echelons of 500 each. About 1500 Austrians have gone through among them having 6 field, and 20 machine guns. 4 6' guns which were taken away from Kushk a few months ago have been sent back with this contingent. At Tashkent Austrian prisoners are being freely enrolled in the Red Guard at rations, 15 rubles a day when not, and 25 rubles a day when fighting. The Hungarians have accepted these terms but Slavs there have refused. The Austrian prisoners domiciled here, who number about 400 and are mostly Slavs, w^ere told that after Russian Easter they would have to choose between joining the Red Guard on above terms or shifting for them selves as best they could as the Bolsheviks would give them no assistance or rations. They refused to join, saying that they had no grievance against the Afghans and would not fight them. The Bolshevik version of this move is that they must guard the frontier against an English or Afghan attack. All people believe that in reality they have designs on Bokhara. The Bolsheviks are scraping up any recruits they can here for the Red Guard—Jews, Tartars, Armenians, Lesghians—anyone they can get on above payment. They have raised about 200 men here in this way. 10th May .—As far as I can ascertain 3,000 men, half Bolsheviks and half Austrians have now gone through to Kushk. There seems as yet no excite ment in Afghanistan on this account. I question arrivals every day but they say that nothing has transpired there yet. \/ 3 (He telegraphed on 7th and 8th in8tant 7*e Bolsheviks, Austrians and guns passing towards Takhta Bazar.)

Report from Askhabad. 12lh May. It is as yet uncertain whether the people will pay up the 7 million rubles demanded by the Bolsheviks or create a disturbance. There is again trouble at Bokhara, and the railway in that region is aeain closed. It is said that the Amir has warned his Sarts to kill no more Musul- rnans, hut to have no mercy on Russians and Armenians. It is stated that fighting has again begun, and that the railways, including that from lermez have again been cut. Report from Merv. llth May .—All the echelons which proceeded to Kushk with guns and machine guns have again passed through on their way towards Tashkent The 6' guns seem to be the only ones which have been left at Kushk. Report from Charjtji. 12th May.—The same trains which took troops to Kushk have now returned. They detrained 8 guns which were disposed round the town and other guns were left on the trains. After staying the night here they ao-ain left in the direction of Kushk. 3 barts hearing a message from the Amir of Bokhara to the Khan of Khiva for assistance have been seized by the Bol~ sheviks here. There are 400 Bolsheviks at Kaghan. (This man was to have gone on to Tashkent and says he has hut from various circumstances X doubt it. E. A. i\ R ) No report received direct from Bokhara since 12th instant substance of which has already been incorporated. The agent had a narrow escape of his life in the last disorders and received a flesh wound in the leg. His house at Karakul was looted and burnt, his house at Bokhara looted, and he himself escaped with difficulty and hid in a disused cemetery for 2 days and a night. He proposed to remain near Ckarjui in case of further disorders both as a precaution and to be able to despatch reports. I propose in future to send you relevant portions of reports received in order to give you a more complete idea of things than is possible in a summary without unduly extending its proportions. The above are the principal reports received during the current week. I must type them as received in order to avoid congestion at the week'end.^ CONI h&gt; sJ ' I b / Meshed Diary No. 16 , for the week ending the 20 th April 1918 . 1. Persian officials. —Sirdar Intisar (paragraph 1 last week) has again resigned the post of acting Governor General, which has now been given to the Karguzar, who is still unfit for work besides being the tool of the extreme democrat party. The Kawwam-us-Sultaneh is expected to arrive in about a fortnight, but the extreme party have now arrested Prince Saham-ul-Mulk, one of the leaders of the an£i-democrats, and it is said that this arrest is to be followed by others. The position is difficult, as the democrat object is to ensure a strong situation for themselves which the Kawwam will be compelled to recognise on arrival. 2. Persian affairs (local). —The agent of Muhammad Ali Sha h (paragraph x ^ 3 of Diary No. 13) has not yet left Meshed, but he does not-seem to have enlisted much sympathy here on behalf of his master. Probably the acute situation re garding the democrat and cmfa-democrat parties is absorbing attention for the 3. The bread question remains acute, but there is some available daily at six lerans per man, a price which is beyond the means of the majority of the townspeople, most of the better middle class of whom are out of work. The feeding arrange ments at this Consulate continue to be of great value though they are carried on with much difficulty in the circumstances described. The self-denying labours of Dr. Esselstyn of the American Mission are beyond all praise ; he attends our premises daily to superintend the work, and during a large part of each day is en gaged in collecting what bread he can for the morrow. Unfortunately this work, while it benefits the community in general and tends to increase the number of our friends, seems to arouse still more bitter feeling against us on the part of the extreme democrats. 4. Persian affairs (general). —The Governor of Kuchan, Shuja-ud-Daulah, has also declined to meet the Kawwam (paragraph 4 last week) giving much the same reasons for his refusal as those given by the Chief of Bujnurd. These chiefs are now both outlaws, more or less, and their dominions are not the only ones in which the Kawwam will have the utmost difficulty in restoring order. i ! 5. Fresh disorders are reported from Bajgiran ; Turkomans having attacked the customs premises again twice during the week. There is no doubt that the Turko mans are getting more and more audacious and are taking every advantage of the lack of authority which prevails on both sides of the border. 6. Turshiz is also again in a disturbed condition. There have been conflicts during the past week between government sowars and a robber band under a rela tive of Aziz-ullah Khan, a prominent resident of the town, and evidence of com plicity against the latter is said to exist. There seems to be a probability of the whole gang being taken, as they have been defeated and their leader captured. 7. Some Turks, said to be doctors of medicine, have been seen at Tun en route for Kain. I have since heard of their arrest and subsequent release at the latter place by Major Lang, Commandant of our levy corps. 8. The inhabitants of Kuchan are expecting attacks by the Turkomans referred to in paragraph 5 above. They are also suffering acutely from a lack of bread, and the bazar has been closed for three days during the past week as a pro moment. test.Indian officer or soldier for the occurrence. A separate report will be made in this connection. 10. Russian affairs. —M. de. Beauvais called upon me to express regret for his recent conduct towards us : the result of the proceedings reported in paragraph 10 last week. He undertakes not to speak against us in future, and assures me that he has no complaint to bring against the British beyond their having brought troops into what was formerly the Bussian sphere of influence. I pointed out to him what it seems impossible to induce them to believe, viz., that we first did all we could to prevent the departure of their own force, and that our men were here in allied interests. i I counselled de Beauvais to get on better with his chief, but he told me quite frankly that he could give no promises in this direction owing to private matters which he explained at length : and upon my suggesting that in the circumstances it might be better for him to apply for a transfer, replied with truth that M. Nicolsky was himself under orders to go : why should he move ? This interview has cleared the air, and I trust that there will be no further difficulty, at least for the present. 11. My colleague in the course of a long visit yesterday requested me to have some Caucasians arrested and deported, but his reasons for the action proposed do not seem to be very convincing. In any case it is better that he should make an official reference. I find on enquiry that the request for action against these men came from the Persian authorities, which, at the present moment, means the extreme democrats. 12. Persian and German intrigues. —The prisoners mentioned in paragraph 15 last week are now in the Ark, to which they were removed on the night of the' 17th instant. There is no intention to despatch them at present so far as we know. 13. The democrats have cleaned and examined their arms during the week, possibly in anticipation of a conflict with the opposing party and have hidden them to guard against possible search. In the meetings during the week our famine relief measures came in for discussion, and various schemes were propounded for interfering with them; none of which found acceptance. It was then said that our troops were about to commence wholesale searching of travellers and others for arms, and various methods of preventing this were proposed ; finally it was decided to await the reply from Tehran which has been expected for so long on the general subject of measures to be taken with regard to foreign troops. Letters from Tehran were then read. It was stated that six of the officials accompanying the new Governor General were democrats; and that Mr. Bravine, the Bolshevik Minister at Tehran, had promised to help Persian democracy, but that the Persian Government have not yet formally accepted him as a Russian represen tative as they are not sure what party will eventually form the Russian Government. Finally it was agreed to send out a democrat deputation to meet the new Governor, and several persons were suggested as the leader. This import ant point has not been decided. 14. News from Turhat-i-Haidari.—The arrival and departure for Meshed of a further detachment of the 19th Punjabis is reported. They are expected to reach here on the 25th instant. 15. News from Tuibat-i-Shaikh Jam. —The arrival in the Jam neghbourhood of the celebrated Sai^id Ahmed Beg, Jamshidi with 1,500 families, is announced. 1 his a is serious matter, as he has allied himself with the Ilbaigi Kaudam and Mir Baki Sultan, and the combination is a menace to the peace of the district. This means more trouble for the unfortunate Kawwam-us-Saltanah. 16. Shaukat-ud-Daulah has written to Mir Baki Sultan directing him to prepare an escort of oO sowai s to accompany him to the reception of the Kawwam, and has also asked for 2,000 tumans as an instalment towards the pishkash neces sary for the occasion. 17. A messenger whom I had sent to Jam to arrange for the transport of wheat and barley purchased in the neighbourhood writes that the Darbari leader Saiyid3 wTillT+ 0 l C0n fw 6n Wh ,° f e , commi tting excesses on the Herat road and have iolled two of Ha]i Husam Agha s agriculturists. torv is anZmeed ^ oi ™ persons deported from Russian terri- tory is announced.

P*' i© f T' . o ! o y b o 19 ] 8 Meshed Diary No. 17 , for the week ending the 27 th April 1918 . 1. Persian officials. —The Kawwam-us-Saltanah has arrived at Sabzawar, and is expected here in about ten days. Meanwhile our friend the Dabir-us- Sultan of Kuchan, who is at present in Meshed, has appointed himself assistant to the Karguzar, and the result is that matters are much easier for us. 2. Persian affairs {local). —No more arrest have followed that of Saham-ul- Mulk, and the Kawwam has telegraphed his displeasure at this action of the democrats. He has moreover directed that Saham should be received with respect by the Governor of Sabzawar (he had been deported to Shahrud) and detained there until his arrival. This notwithstanding that the Kawwam had been informed by telegram that Saham had been deported for intriguing against him a complete falsehood, as he had merely taken up an rtwii-democrat position on his expulsion from the society. 3. An absurd rumour having gained credence that bombs were being manu factured by certain Armenians, employes of Russian and Persian firms of Meshed, their houses were searched during the week. Nothing was found. This circum stance seems to be connected in some way with the military action now being taken by Armenians elsewhere against the Turks. 4. Shahzadah Murtaza Mirza (paragraph 2 of Diary No. 15) has left for Turbat-i-Haidari with the object of exporting grain from that place to Meshed. He has asked for the assistance of our Agent there, and I am communicating with the latter as there is ground for suspicion that the Shahzadah intends to prevent the acquisition by us of grain already purchased at Turbat which is awaiting transport. 5. The bread question has been at its worst during this week. On the 25th and 26th there was none to be bought at most of the shops in the town, and we had much difficulty in procuring enough for our servants and establishment. To-day we have succeeded in obtaining sufficient to resume our famine relief work. 6. I have twice telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister urging the re-establish ment of M. Kornelis as Finance Commissioner, and as a result the latter has been recommended to wait for a day or two pending political changes which are shortly expected. Nothing can exceed the help that I have had from this gentleman, and the rude manner in which he was ejected from office provides an additional reason for demanding his re-instatement 7. Persian affairs (general ).—The disturbances at Bajgiran continue, further fighting having taken place during the week between Turkomans and the Naib-iU- Hukvmah, M. Delcorde has sent me a copy of a telegram from M. Spinella inform ing him that as the local authorities are unable to cope with the frequent raids he and his staff will be obliged to quit Bajgiran unless help comes from outside. A proposal to despatch to Bajgiran some men of the Persian Cossack Brigade does not seem to have borne fruit; the local Government preferring to await the arrival of the Governor-G eneral. 8. The people of Shirwan have taken sanctuary in the local telegraph office on account of the scarcity of bread, and are daily taking wheat by force from the revenue office. The Karguzar of Meshed has telegraphed to Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan, in whose jurisdiction Shirwan now is, reprimanding him for the condition of affairs in Shirwan and Bajgiran and pointing out that his reason for not going to meet the new Governor-General was the number of disorders in his district which needed urgent attention. This the telegram remarks, they do not seem to be receiving. 9. It is reported that the Janglis are negociating with the Chief of Bujnurd and the Governor of Kuchan, after these negociations have resulted in an alliance they intend to move in the direction of Meshed. It is not known what truth there is in this but the Chief of Bujnurd has evidently come under some unfriendlyLa I [Jlfilfl \ 1 B [j. f • !■ inflow.

This is not approved by the nL^bwants of Gonabad. who have telegraphed a protest. They have been told to represent them grievance to the Kawwam on his arrival. 12 British affairs. — The vahie of imports rid the Xoshki route last month is over five lakhs of rupees. The complete statistics for the month are not yet m. ,3 The provision of supplies for the troops in garrison (whose number has teen augtneJed tog the week by the arrival of 80 more men ol the I9th Pimiabis under Captain Hart) continues to be difficult and mmbksome^and to meet with Disposition from the extreme democrat partv. whose towever counteraoted to some extent by the help of the Dabir-us-Milt^ (p-ra^ph 1 above!

Xuyid Haider and ^alar Khar, the Hazara and Baluch Chiefs, after undertaking to supply ^icnn. are now hesitating apparently as a result of democrat threats. The former, m reply to a letter from me urging him to fulfil his undertaking, now says that his men cannot accept service as they cannot leave their families in these times. He promises to use his good offices with Salar Khan. There is no one here at present who can help in this matter, but I hope that on the arrival of the new Governor-General the objections will disappear ana the men required come forward. 15 Russian affairs.-hlv colleague called to inform me that the Caucasians had applied to the Minister iii Tehran for his removal from Meshed in favour of de Beauvais (paragraph 10 last week): and I have now recommended the transfer of de Beauvais, pointing out that if M. Nicolsky receives orders for the transfer he can with our assistance carry them out. He thinks that if de Beauvais receives no more salary here his position will become impossible and he will then accept another post. ' From our point of view there is not much to choose between these two men now that de Beauvais no longer declares his enmity to the British, but there is no reason to witlty%w our support from his senior. A report from the Caucasian meetings says that the members are now collecting firearms and are awaiting the arrival of the Bolsheviks so long expected from Askabad. - ’ 16. Owing to reduction in funds the Russian Consulate General is now obliged to redurce the establishment and to pay those employees who remain at a reduced rate of excha:«ge. 17 There is at present no export to Russia, and large quantities of opium, insured bv the Russian bank, are Iving at Bajgiran which, as reported above, is in a most disturbed condition. My colleague has written officially to ue Karnuzar inforamg him that the Persian Government will be held responsible for *nv loss in this cennectien. Disputes have arisen during the week between the Karpuzar end the Russian Bank : the latter have threatened to pay no further Persian claims if their own claims against Persian subjects are not settlea with A-v,more rapidity. The Karguzar represents to M. Mcolsky that the delay and incon venience complained of are caused by the incompetence of his second secretary, (11. * u r ^'^ ie l^ uss i an Bank Manager at Kuchan reports an attack on his house by a and of armed ruffians, and asks for help from my colleague, who has written officially to the Karguzar. Reports of enemy intrigue at Kuchan are constantly being received, and there seems to be no doubt that a few escaped prisoners have recently passed through the town en route to Tehran from Russian territory. It may be necessary to station a detachment of troops at Kuchan after discussion with the Governor General. 19. Petfjian am]. German intrigues.—The arrival of four Turkish escaped prisoners at Khakister is reported. They are to be sent to Meshed by the local txovemor. The prisoners mentioned in recent Diaries are still here : I hope to make an arrangement with the Kawwam on his arrival which will settle this matter once for all. 20. The democrat meetings are very quiet at present: the members of the society are said to feel that events are about to take place which will not be to their advantage. They have this week merely indulged in abuse of the British with discussion of the possibility of their final defeat and ejection from Persia by the Germans. 20. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. Our Agent, with the help of the local garrison has enlisted 20 Hazaras for the levy corps. 21. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam—It is reported that the Hazara leaders of this neighbourhood are collecting their sowars apparently with the object of strengthening themselves against the combination of the Ilbaigi Kaudani, Mir Baki Sultan, and the Jamshidis. Possibly the failure of Saiyid Haider to provide sowars for the levy corps is due to this : from the wording of his reply referred to above it ceratinly appears possible. 22. News from Karaiz. Mirza Ismail Khan, now known as the Russian Agent at Karaiz, has returned from a visit to Khaf. He announces that the Russian Consul General at Meshed and the Vice-Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari are consulting in regard to his position, sowars, etc. 23. News from Herat. —Von Gruden has received a letter from Meshed brought by a Barbari: the letter informed him that the British had posted sowars and infantry all along the frontier of Afghanistan and Persia so that they could not now cross it. This man is to return to Meshed with a reply. 24. Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat-ullah visited the Naib Solar (who was indisposed) on the 16th instant. They conversed with him about the war : discussing the possibilities of the arrival of German troops at Askabad, etc. Later Kazim asked why the Afghans were losing the opportunity which the present situation afforded of invading Russia. The Naib replied to this that the Amir would no doubt give orders if and when he considered that the time had arrived for action. 25. Nasrullah announced on the 18th the occupation of Petrograd by German troops, and added that the Germans were now about to restore the Czar Nicholas to his throne, where he would govern in future under the advice of German officers. _ 26. There is no more talk of departure, though purchases have been made during the week which might be connected with a journey. 27. News from Turkestan and Transcaspia. —Some elders of the Persian community at Bokhara have come to Darajaiz and taken sanctuary in the local telegraph office. They have asked the Persian Government to depute a special official to go to Bokhara and enquire into the losses sustained by them, and also to make some arrangements with the Bolsheviks for their future safety. Baku appears to be in the hands of Bolsheviks and Armenians. Bands of well armed brigands are stopping and pillaging passenger trains between Petrovsk4r and Rostov; and fighting is in progress among the mountain tribes of the northern Caucasus. The situation in Turkestan is indefinite. General Dutov with a force of Ural Cossacks has captured Orenburg, and the Bolsheviks are sending all available reinforcements to Tashkent upon which town Dutov is believed to be advancing. W. G.

The mischief is attributed to the instigation of one Sardar Rahim Khan Muham- madzai. (2) Under the Brigadier of Farah and Chakhansur, Muhammad Sarwar Khan, there are now three Kumedans, Sher Muhammad Khan, Muhammad Sharif Khan and Kutub. (3) The three regiments in this Brigade have been expanded, to contain six companies each instead of five. The Khassedar corps is said to have been similarly expanded. (4) It is said that troops from Kandahar are coming to replace the local troops in Chakhansur because the usefulness of the latter is discounted owing to all the men having their families with them.

This arrangement was only made after the Chief Manager in Tehran had invoked the assistance of His Majesty’s Legation in the matter J The Managers at both Sistan and Birjand had previously been trying to hire camels for this purpose without invoking the Consulate’s assistance and they naturally failed, as the transporters of this district were apprehensive of being commandered for work with the South Persia Bifles. Democrats' activities. During the week a Democratic Committee has been formed in^Sistan including the friends of the locally notorious Mulla, Shaikh Jawwad, of Tehran who has long been intriguing against our chief mvjtehids. The committee is said to be an^-Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The Chief of Police is watching its members carefully. The Governor has expressed a wish that a rival committee should be formed, but I am inclined to discourage such a movement, hoping that the other will soon die of inanition. News from Afghanistan.

After a long interval they have received letters from their comrades^ at Kabul and their party has been increased by an individual of whom, at present little is known, but who from description appears to be a European. ^ * . 1( l d \ Ber f Troops.—lu answer to enquiries the British Agent states that the infantry of the garrison is about 1,250 under establishment strength which is much the same as was the case last September. The Chaharyari and Turki Cavalry regiments are respectively 30 and 50 men below establishment. The new cavalry regiment contains 250 men but 50 of these are as yet without horses. An officer has been deputed to Maimanah to purchase horses for artillery work. According to a statement of the Officer Commanding Artillery the mortar battery is to be classed as “ spare, ” and the guns at Ghurian are to be brought to Herat. The personnel of these units will be used to supplement the strength ot the mountain artillery. J . 05 - Supplies .—A shortage of grain in the Government stores on the Ghurian frontier is reported. The local governors report that no more taxes in kind are recoverable for the moment and that no grain can be purchased. The A aib-ul-Hukumah has ordered a small amount to be sent from Herat urgently. 106.

Current affairs. —The conflict in Bokharan territory continues to occupy the attention of all in Turkistan, but news is still practically unobtain- able as to what is actually proceeding to the east of the Oxus. Maximalist communication is by wireless from Ziadin station in Bokharan territory to Chariui through Kushk, a sufficiently roundabout way. Attempts were apparently being made from the west (Charjui) to join Kolessov and his bands operating near Kermine, but as far as news recorded in the paper “ Askhabad ” of the 19th March goes, the junction had not been effected. Bolsheviks sources state Kermine was bombarded and captured by the Bolsheviks on the 15th March, when a dead Russian officer was found among the defenders. Various prisoners, Russians and others, were released. Fighting had also pro ceeded on the Zerafsh and near Zianin, a Bokharan detachment moving from Kitab towards Samarkand had been routed, and other skirmishes terminating in favour of the Bolsheviks had occurred. Finally it was said that an armistice had been declared and that the Bokharans themselves were helping to restore the railway which had been practically destroyed over a distance of some 90 yersts. Reports received and the statements of arrivals (the latter being the most recent) do not appear to confirm these statements as regards Bolshevik success, and the latter are said to be nervous. The account given in the l&lt; Askha bad *’ of a Bolshevik meeting at Askhabad about the 10th March shews that the Bolsheviks were by no means happy m their minds and very anxious to persuade those present to volunteer to proceed to the support of Kolessov, while the meet ing appeared equally anxious not to leave Askhabad and protested that rifles had been served out to them for self-defence and not for offensive action It was apparent that reinforcements of 300 Red Guards from Askhabad, 150 from Krasnovodsk, and 150 from Kizil Arvat had already been sent. Arrivals who left Charjui on the 26th and 27th ultimo state the Bokharans have now been joined by a large number of Kbivan Turkomans, that the railway which had been repaired has now again been destroyed behind the Bolsheviks the damage extending as far as 4 stations to the west of Charjui, and that m further encounters the Bolsheviks have had the worst of it. Their chief difficulty is said to be want of supplies and a large quantity of bread baked at Merv is sent daily towards Charjui. The Bokharans are also, from native sources, meeting with success in holding back the Bolsheviks attempting to advance from the direction of Samarkand. Tartar soldiers of whom there have recently been a fairly large proportion in Turkistan are said to have joined the Amir. Supplies and property looted at the destruction of Old Charjui have been transferred to Merv. The actual cause of the fighting at Charjui seems to have been the forcible exaction of a large money contribution from the population, and a demand for 700,000 rubles has now been laid on the inhabi tants of Merv. Red Guards receive 25 rubles pay per diem and as much as they can loot. Persian and Turkoman workmen have been engaged for railway work at 15 rubles per diem. 40 Afghans are said to have been killed at Charjui and the reply made to Afghan protests that these men were fighting against the Russians. Herat Jews have written to their co-religionists at Merv that Afghan troops may he expected in Turkistan, but there is no indication of this in latest Herat reports. Austrian prisoners at Merv are said to number 170. Complete anarchy reigns at Russian Sarakhs and at Pul-i-Khatun. Posts in the vicinity have been abandoned. Repairs to the barracks at the former place have been abandoned and the contractor and workmen have left. The handful of Russian soldiers at these places were expected to evanesce very shortly. Much anti-British talk among Russians (presumably Bolsheviks) in Turkistan is reported, and an arrival is responsible for a rumour that some Persian spies have been engaged by the Bolsheviks to report on the strength of British troops in Khorasan.

Ihe tmrdar of Bujnurd supplied savars to escort 15 others to Shahrud on the f™ 1 Mn ^ h, ^ n * d 20 . reaohed Kuohan on the 3rd instant where they still appear to be. The 7 Austrians at the Karguzari here have been joined by 2 others who nppear io have been smuggled into the town by the good offices of Agha- zadah. There are in addition 6 Turks in the town at present. The Austrians travel m either Persian or Russian dress, or in their own uniform. There i&amp;ay be some hope that Colonel Meohetich, who is alive to the importance of laying hands on these gentry, may be able to capture them on the road to Tehran ; and Captain Sergieevich, who is in the neighbourhood of oabzwar has been telegraphed to on the subject, but in any case the presence of posts of tlie^ Persian Cossack Brigade at Shahrud and Astrabad is very j advisable if it is possible to institute them. However far to the north our ! J ordon may eventually extend it will always be possible for escapm^ prisoners to turn its northern flank. x. o r The Austrian prisoners here have beeii beard to extol Kuchik Khan. 110. Loo'll affairs.—Thz scarcity of wheat in tin town is causing increased distress and deaths owing to hunger pure and simple or to disease owing to malnutrition have occurred. Tentative bread riots, so far easily dealt with, have taken place and bakers have been publicly flogged ponr encourager les out res. The arrival of Kavvam-as-Saltanah, which is expected shortly, may result in measures for bringing in grain from districts where it is relatively plentiful. It is difficult to state how far local cornering is responsible for the dearth of grain, as with high prices prevailing and the approach of harvest time, it might be expected that stocks would now be thrown on the market if they actually exist. Caucasian Turks have been attracting some attention. The intrigue, headed by M- de Beauvais and Mir Murtaza, appeared likely to come to a head during the week and a coup d'etat was announced for the 10th instant when the Consul-General and his dragoman M. Kaal were to be offered the alternatives of resignation or forcible removal, the two worthies first-mentioned being designated to succeed them. On the personal request to H. B. M- Consul-General from M. Jfikolski for protection a small detachment of our troops were in evidence near the Russian Consulate.-Gener.al on the 10th instance but nothing transpired. The Turks subsequently expressed much surprise at so mistaken an idea of their in tentions having been reported, and state that they are taking methodical evidence of bribery and corruption of which their Consul-General has been guilty in the past, and that they will proceed to action when their case is complete. Mir Murtaza, whose trial for the embezzlement of 4.0,000 tomans was automatically quashed by the Russian revolution, will no doubt afford expert assistance. Anti- ^English talk among these people is freely reported, The democrats are said to have sent representatives tq the Caucasus with the object of anti-English propaganda and of entering into closer relations with the Turks. A look-out is being kept for two Turkish agents who are said to have arrived here secretly. Recently dissensions appear to have arisen between the Caucasians and the loc i democrats, and both parties are going armed in fear of the other. The democrats and the Society of TJi ion and Progress are also at loggerheads. S3G7gsbS u\id Ahmad Beg comes aud goe 9 seore ly from Zorabad.

Ill Germans and adherents.— 'Letters have been received from the Aus- frians at Kabul and from Mohendro Partab, the last named being reported to have written from Russian territory. (According to information from Kashgar, Mohendro proceeded to Tashkent at the head of a “ mission.’ This is far from unlikely') The letters appeared to cause ■ satisfaction and Kazim Beg subse- nuently bad a confidential interview with the Naib-ubHukumah. The party are spreading reports of the capture of Bag],dad, and of the proximate^ arrival of a German force to turn the English out of Meshed, and to effect a junction with Afghanistan. 212 Military affairs. —The Naib-ul-Hukumah at the invitation of the Naib Salar presided at a species of field-day at which artillery and infantry were present. Much satisfaction was caused by the work of the mountain artillery, a eun being unloaded from the mule, fired, and reloaded on the animal within 3 minutes. Field guns fired at one another, the personnel finally charging one another on horseback with drawn swords. The infantry were then examined and the Naib-ul-Hukumah distributed largesse to all concerned. A farman has been emulated in the districts calling for horses fit for artillery work to be produced for purchase. If a sufficient number be obtained it is intended to bring a proportion of the “ spare ’ artillery on to the regular establishment. An order for the dismissal on the ground of old age of 30 men of the Ghaznichi battalion was held over for the time owing to the destitution to which their families would be subjected at present. Afghan soldiers newly arrived at Zulfiqar from Herat, when making purchases at Zulfiqar, enquired whether the report of fighting between Indian troops and the population of Meshed was correct. Russian Turkistan. 113. Current According to reports from agents and from various sources the Bolsheviks have persuaded the Amir of Bokhara to consent to a cessation of hostilities by a promise to agree to his terms. The Amir has actually withdrawn his forces towards Bokhara, and the Bolsheviks are in occupation of Charjui whence they are hastily repairing the railway eastwards. Previous to this armistice their attempts to do this were frustrated, the Bokharans obtaining possession of the material, burning the sleepers and carry ing off or burying the rails. They also dug pits or trenches filled with water on the track. Under the most favourable circumstances the repairs will give much trouble and material is wanting, that designed for the branch to Naphtha Dag in Transcaspia being used up for this purpose. Repair of the track from Samarkand to Bokhara is already said to be completed, but the destruction on the Charjui side was apparently more severe, and a recent arrival from Bokhara stated that he had to proceed to Ckarjui on foot. Distrust is aroused in Bokharan minds by the fact that in spite of their pacificatory assurances the Bolsheviks are moving men and guns towards Bokhara as the repairs to the railway proceed, and ultimate treachery is suspected. An order from the Bolshevik commander on the spot enjoins all defensive precautions to be taken as the work progresses. According to native repor sv c horses fit it iher he oltt JO men of I le destiiw whea nk betweeal* ndfrom®! tocoasei' 111 The Amiris jlsbdfi Jf! ; fmstrM^ &gt;pers ilf 11 . L the last serious fight occurred at the end of March when the Bokharans suffered 1,500 casualties and the Bolsheviks. 2,000 the affair terminating in favour of the for mer. A remarkable feature of the case is that the Bolsheviks were successful in inducing—probably by heavy payment—some 400 Trans caspian Turkomans to fight for them against their co-religionists. Bolshevik communiques (by wireless) in papers up to the 2nd April are very guarded and make no mention of success. It may therefore be taken as extremely probable that native reports of Bokharan success are in the main correct. Beyond the services of Russian officers the Amir has some 35 Austrian prisoners who are busy in making arms and ammunition for him. He is reported to have 10 guns and a total force of about 50,000 men. Even if not exaggerated it is probable that the majority of these are very poor material and poorly armed. An Armenian soldier who recently deserted to Meshed estimates the maximum Bolshevik strength at the following places as:— Aekkabad Merv Charjui Samarkand Tashkent 600 800 200 1,000 * 3,000 Their main source of supply is the staff of railway workmen who are far from inexhaustible if the line is to be kept working, and the difficulty lately experienced at Askhabad in finding a draft of 50 men points to a lack of man power. They are said to have asked for reinforcements from Russia but to have been refused, and also reprimanded for entering into conflict with the Bokharans. They loot as freely as they can, in the opinion of many natives, with the idea of making hay while they can. The Russians are completely evacuating the neighbourhood of Sarakhs, and are selling up the furniture of the Sarakhs and Pul-i-Khatun hospitals. Russian Sarakhs is now so unsafe that all musulman inhabitants are hastily moving across to Persian Sarakhs. Turcomans in the neighbourhood have recommenced traffic in Persian women and girls whom they have either raided or purchased. Meshed ; 13'h April 1913. E. A. P. REEL, Lieutenant-Colonel, O. S. O.13 CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 47, for the week ending the 24th November 1917. (t 1. Persian officials. —The Naiyir-ud-Daulah h.a,s resigend his appointment to the Governor-Generalship of Khorassan in view of the feeling against him. Muhakkik-ud-Daulah, Karguzar of Meshed, has notified us of his occupation of the post pending the appointment of a permanent incumbent. 2. Persian affairs (local). —The democrats are apparently not satisfied with their victory in regard to the Naiyir. They still frequent the telegraph office, and are now demanding to know the name of the person suggested as Governor General in his place ; with the acceptance of their views regarding the appointment of a Swedish officer as Chief of local Police and general re-organisation of the Police Department in Khorasan. Meanwhile the Karguzar has been instructed by Tehran to cause them to quit the telegraph office. 3. The Karguzar has informed Tehran officially that the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik had no connection with the outrage reported in paragraph 1 last week. This appears to be correct: it is generally believed that the perpetrators were Shikari robbers, engaged for the purpose by Haji Husain Aghawho has more to lose than other person by the return of the Naiyir-ud-Daulah to Khorassan. 4. The Meshed democrats have suggested to Government that the Naiyir-ud- Daulah’s villages in Nishapur district should be removed from Tehran jurisdiction direct and placed under the government of Khorassan. Their object is to give trouble to the owner. 5. The price of bread has risen locally within the last few days, but satisfactory arrangements are in progress for the importation of wheat from various outstations, and the rise will be temporary only. Prices generally are increasing, and the absence of autumn rain gives rise to renewed anxiety. 6. Persian affairs' {general). —Haji Husain Agha (paragraph 3 above) is making full use of the times. His Shikari robbers have been unusually active during the past week. The Governor of Chinaran with some of his sowars attacked a party of them on the 21st and killed one whereupon a large body attacked Chinaran village and burnt a storehouse. This so frightened the Governor that he deserted his post and has come in to Meshed leaving his people at the mercy of the Shikaris. 7. In consequence of the murder of a Baluch by Turkomans near Sarakhs the Baluchis have risen and plundered 600 sheep, the property of Turkomans. The latter, who are Russian subjects, are demanding the return of their poperty in the Russian courts. 8. The robbery of a caravan from Meshed is reported to have taken place on the Khakistar road near Kizil Khisht, but prompt action by the local Karasuran resulted in two robbers being killed and two captured. 9. Russian affairs.—The Shikari outlaws mentioned above have murdered a Russian Cossack near Chinaran, and a troop of Cossacks ahsgone out to enquire. 10. Misconduct by Russian Cossacks in Meshed city is reported. On the night of the 20th five of them attacked the house of the Austrian dentist (who has been allowed to remain here after some consideration early in the war), and after breaking windows and generally creating a disturbance were removed by the Police. The Commandant has since placed an officer on special duty at night to prevent such disorders. 11. Persian and German intrigues. —The recent successful action in regard to the Naiyir-ud-Daulah mentioned above has (brought about a rapprochement between the conflicting parties of democrats ; but it is^ believed to be merely temporary especially as there are differences of opinion in regard tothechoise of a Governor-General.% 'Win :| K.! iir. I i uf 111 !• t • : ; 12. Encouraging letters have been received from Tehran by the local democrats during the week in which they are again urged to increase their stock of fire-arms. 13. The arrival of a Turk and an Austrian at the Karguzari is secretly reported : it is said that the latter brought with him a letter of recommendation from the leader of the local democrats, Haji Muhammad Ja’far Kashmiri. The Karguzar is said to have referred to Tehran the question of their disposal, but he replied to M. Nicolsky that the two men were coming but had not yet arrived, and promised to hand them over to him on arrival. Further enquiries are being made. It is just possible that these may be some of the party who recently left Herat, but they are more likely to be escaped prisoners, of which the number seems to be on the increase. 14. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Soon after the return of the Russian troops to Turbat (paragraph 11 last week) a report was received by the Consul that some of the German party had been recaptured. A patrol was accordingly sent out again to Turshiz to take them over. This party returned to Turbat yesterday with three Austrians and one Persian who say that the report of Wagner having been killed is not correct; that he, with one Persian, escaped early in the fight. The Austrians are being sent to Meshed, where they may be expected to arrive to-morrow, and the Persian is destined at Turbat for the present. Separate reports will be submitted on this subject. 15. M. Maximofi arrived at Turbat-i-Haidari on the 18th instant. He has taken over charge of the Vice-Consulate, and M. Antipoff is to come to Meshed forthwith. 16. News from Turbaf-i-Shaikh Jam. —Shaji-us-Sultanah has returned to Meshed (paragraph 13 last week), the Government troops who accompanied him having returned on account of the change in the local Government. It will be difficult now to arrange this matter satisfactorily until a permanent Governor General is appointed, as Haji Husain Agha’s star is in the ascendant, my colleague is occupied with his approaching departure, and there is literally no means of dealing with the situation. The Karguzar has promised to call Shaukat-ud-Daulah to Meshed, but there is no reason to suppose that he will be more successful than others have been in this. I have no doubt, however, that our wishes will eventually be carried out. / 17. One Shukr-ullah, messenger of Ahl-ullah, a Herat! trader of Meshed, has been robbed- of roubles 125,000 in notes, which he was conveying to Herat. This robbery took place on the main road near Jam, and it is believed to be the work of the Ilbaigi Kaudani’s men. 18. The murder of one Amir Kuli is reported to have taken place near Jam. This is the man whose information led to the arrest of the Ilbaigi by the Russians last year, and he has evidently been killed in revenge. The condition of this district will become worse so long as the present resistance to Shaji’s return is allowed to continue : he alone succeeded in keeping these refractory tribesmen in order, and the reason for their siding with Shaukat is obvious. 19. News from Kariz.— Om Agent was informed by the Russian doctor cn the 18th instant that a force of 20 Russian Cossacks and some Persian Cossacks had been sent to Khaf to deal with the notorious Mir Yusuf, who was giving trouble there. _ No report has reached us from any other source in this connection, but enquiries will be made. 20. News from Herat.-^N flock-owner from the frontier of Kara Teppe complained to the Naib-ul-Hukumah that emigrants to Russian territory hud carried away with them 300 of his sheep, and that he had not succeeded in inducing the Russian authorities to secure their return. The Naih has referred the matter to his deputy, Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan, for negotiation with the authorities concerned. 21. As reported last week, Wagner-had appointed the Austrian known as “ Mirza ” (whose name appears to be Kroten) leader of the German party during his absence. This position seems to have displeased Kazim Beg who thinks that as he is an officer he should have been left in charge. Maulvi Barkatullah has now 14I 4 f m Mei lepmi taut, Hek ^ td l s return ampaiiied it it.

[inini^ j the 3 aatlffl® 5 i hno^, 1 * lartyi^ thii^ lahh^ 3 4 produced a document signed by Wagner placing Mm in charge, and this arrangement seems to have been accepted by the conflicting parties. 22. On the 13th November Kazim Beg visited the Naib Solar and in congratulating some newly promoted officers remarked that they were fortunate in having as their commander a second Anvar Pasha. After this piece of flattery he induced the Naib to promise him a guide to lead him into Persia. 23. On the 14th the Naib Solar, in the course of conversation with some person whose identity our Agent does not disclose, remarked with regret on the unpreparedness of Afghanistan for war. His companion asked with whom they were going to fight, as Russia was engaged in civil war, the British were their friends, and there could be no question of a war with Persia. The Naib Salar had nothing to reply beyond hinting at the possibility of a religious war. 24. On the 14th Maulvi Barkat-ullah checked Wagner’s boxes, packages, etc., with a list which he has. He has appointed Puri Khan, who is now called Ibrahim Khan, as his assistant. i The Maulvi has directed the remainder of the party to get leave from him when they wish to bring out the mules, etc., with a view to departure. Certain preparations for departure are being made. 25. It appears that Kazim Beg wished to go with Wagner, but that the Maulvi insisted on his remaining with him : he being unwell and unfit to travel. 26. Our Agent reports,, dated the 16th instant, that Kazim Beg, the Austrian Kroten (Mirza) and Deitroyitch (Ali Khan), with Haji Ahmad, Arab, will leave for Persia at once. This information has been circulated by telegram as usual, and the Russians have been told. Meshed: ^ W. G.

Saiyid Kazim, the late SeristaMar of Cnakhansur, has escaped into Sistan with all his family and servants—about ten persons. It is said that he proposed to the Governor that they should iointly embezzle a large portion of the revenue assessment, and that the Governor did not agree. It seems improbable that Saiyid Kazim is in German employ. News from Afghanistan. (1) See last week’s diary. I hear that Abdul Aziz Kudbedani is considered to have exceeded his orders and is in disgrace with the Chakhansur authorities who have ordered his arrest. A letter which I have written to the Governor and Brigadier on the subject of Abdul Aziz’s activities has not been replied to yet. (2) Twenty Nurzais of Kokal near Sabzawar, followers of Abdul Hakim Khan are said to be contemplating a raid into Kainat. (3) It is rumoured in Sistan that several hundred families of Barbaris (Hazaras) have migrated recently from Persian Khorassan to Afghanistan, where they have been well received and offered employment in the Kandahar province. (4) A Brigadier, named Muhammad Sarwar Khan, has arrived in Kala-i-Kang from Kabul. He is presumably the relief of Ghulam Ahmed Khan. (5) The presence of Shah Nazar Khan (see Diary No. 44) at Khwaja Ahmed is apparently annoying the authorities of Chakhansur. I hear that they are claim ing 153 camels from him. Arms Traffic in Sistan. A number of Sistan is of Mian Kangi and Tanghazi have recently set out for Yezd, travelling probably via Deh Salm. They are ostensibly going to take over their goods stolen about a year ago and now recovered by the Governor from certain followers of Vakil-vd-Dauleh, a land-owner of Yezd.

PBIDEAUX, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. % \SECRET. o .) i j Intelligence Summary No. 45, for the week ending November 10th, 1917. Khorasan and North-East Persia. 510. Russian force. —The Cossack cordon has been on the qui vive for the German party since warned on the 30th ultimo of their being on -the move. A patrol was sent to the Hashtadan froritier through Rui Khaf, and a small detachment left at the latter place. No report has come from them and it is clear that they were too late there. On Persian information that some 15 persons in Turkoman dress had been seen near Turshiz, patrol under the command of the Officer Commanding, Turbat-i-Haidari — a reliable and energetic officer — proceeded there on the 6th instant. From Persian accounts, which require verifica tion, it appears that a party of strangers encamped in a garden near Turshiz, and being taken for robbers, Karasuran savars surrounded the garden and shots were exchanged. Apparently no one was hurt; three Persian followers were captured and the Europeans escaped. The Karasuran were said to have gone in pursuit. The date is not clear but this would probably have occurred on the 5th instant. The Officer Commanding, Russian troops in Khorasan yesterday received telegram from Turbat-i-Haidari, dated the same day, to the effect that the Governor of Turshiz had arrested 10 Germans but refused to hand them over to the Russian commanding officer pending instructions from the Governor-General of Khorasan which the Russian Consul-General at Meshed was asked to obtain without delay. It was further stated that a reinforcement of 41 Cossacks under an officer had been sent to Turshiz from Turbat-i-Haidari, and that the Russian Consul at the latter place had sent instructions to the Governor of Turshiz (a son of Kamran Mirza) to hand over the prisoners to the Russian force. No later news is to hand for the moment, nor is it clear at what point the Germans crossed the cordon line. It may be remarked that had Shaji-us-Saltanah been on the spot to supplement the Russian posts the Germans would have had little chance of getting so far. As matters stood a party with good guides and reasonable luck would have little difficulty in passing between the posts by night. 511. Local affairs. —Shaji-us-Saltanah has left for Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam with orders to reassume the Governorship of the region. The Shikari, Zushki, and other robbers remain troublesome, and Sayyid Haidar Barbari has distinguished himself by looting a fairly large quantity of grain. Turkoman from the direction of Sarakhs recently sold 3 flocks of sheep of 700 to 800 head each in the neighbourhood of Barashk, as well as some horses and camels. They stated that they had received assurances from the Afghan authorities that they should be granted land near Gulran rent free for 3 years and a loan to enable them to comrhence cultivation if they migrated with their families. On the other hand Turkoman robbers have looted flocks near Zorabad, killing 2 shepherds. Herat and Afghanistan. 512. Germans and adherents. —The Austrian called “ Ali Khan ” has with Nasrullah Khan been left in charge at Bagh-i-Kartah. Kazim Beg is said to be contemplating an early departure, but will first try to ascertain that Wagner has got through safely. The Afghan escort which returned from the frontier and a muleteer who went back somewhat later will probably have reported all well for the start. The Russians have been warned to be on the look-out and the Officer Commanding, Sistan, notified. Apparently a good deal of bagjgage has been left by the Germans at Herat. An agent just returned from Termez states that Mohendro Pratap was piesent at Mazar-i-Sharif 12 days ago. Arrangements have been made to ensure as early intelligence of his movements as Russian communications will permit. 513. Herat droops.—The Khaki battalion, having finished repairs to their lines are engaging in field practices outside the city. C50FD 3The Naib Salar has had farriers sent out to the various stables in the district where Government horses are kept to shoe them as soon as possible. They will then be brought into Herat for his inspection. Murad Hhan, in charge of the stables in Herat, has been ordered to make pack saddles for the artillery horses in the city in order that they may help in bringing in the revenue gram. Other horses are to be brought in from the district stables to replace them. With reference to paragraph 491, the Herat agent states that there are two officers named Mahmud Khan in the Herat garrison but that neither of them has recently been absent. He suggests that the individual mentioned may be employed on a frontier duty, or have^been sent from Afghan Turkistan, or even that as Heratis often dress in semi-military sty4e, he may have been a from/hfe merchant. Having regard to the report received, the last supposition is not very likely to be correct. 514. Mazar-i-Sharif .—There is stated to be no question for the present of the reapplication of the conscription of 1 man per 8 at Mazar, and the people are said to be in a normally quiet frame of mind. Several arrivals from Afghan Turkistan, including the agent from Termez, state that a large number of magazine rifles has been received at Mazar and at Maimana within the last 3 months, but that they have not been issued to troops. Confirmation of this report is being sought. Russian Turkistan. 515. Current affairs .—Russian papers ‘contain little news of interest but general conditions shew no improvement. Several of the ring-leaders of tlie late disorders were arrested on the 31st October one of them bearing the Teutonic patronymic of Schmidt. The murderer of the officer noted last week has escaped, together with other soldiers condemned to long terms of imprisonment, from the lashkent quarter guard. This is the second recent case of such escapes. There is much suffering in Semirechia : according to native reports the Kirghiz are eating cats and dogs. Many of them make for Tashkent but die by the way. Sanction for the issue of 11| millions of rubles for relief measures has at last been obtained, and it is expected that the funds will shortly be administered. Generally speaking compensation for last year’s disorders will be given on at the rate of 500 rubles for a Russian farm house destroyed, and 100 rubles per Kirghiz hut. A census of the prisoners of war in Turkistan has been ordered the main object being accurate information as to the actual numbers in the country. There is some local indignation at the fact that the prisoners receive 1| tbs. of bread daily, whereas Russian civilians are limited to | lb. per head. An article in a local paper estimates the number of German and Austrian prisoners at lashkent itself at 30,000, and asks why, at such a time of scarcity, they should not be trans ferred to Akmolinsk where bread is cheap and plentiful. The amount of liberty which they enjoy is also animadverted upon. The article is obviously highly coloured, but contains more than a substratum of truth. According to an officer they are now obliged to wear uniform, but until quite recently went about in plain clothes. Supervision at the barracks where the majority are accommodated is most lax. There is little to prevent them giving a helping hand to any disorderly movement, and I should imagine that escapes to Afghanistan and Persia are mainly limited by the consideration that they are more comfortable where they are. From a conversation with the officer of the Semirechia regiment who was called to assist in the repression of the Tashkent disorders it appears that accounts given in previous summaries are in the main correct, though more incendiarism and disorder occurred than was stated in the papers. When the outbreak occurred the only Cossacks in the town were an escort of 50 men. All other troops, of whom the 1st and 2nd Siberian Reserve Regiments formed the majority, were on the side of disorder. The Semirechia draft of 160 men was the first to arrive on the scene and immediately proceeded to patrol the city. An Orenburg sotnia arrived two days later, followed by the Officer Commanding Turkistan Cossack Division with 2 more Semiiechia sctmas. The mutinous troops were gradually won over, 44 3 r«SS and by tne arrival of General Korovnichenko with 2 armoured cars and 5 cavalry squadrons, order had practically been restored without any fighting. The cavalry themselves were distinctly unreliable, and an infantry brigade which had been ordered to Tashkent had refused to proceed. According to this informant General Ivorovmchenko, whose service has been largely in the legal branch is far from a strong man, and military chiefs generally are afraid to act with decision. Turkomans in Transcaspia are so far unable to obtain seed grain and fears are entertained that it may not be received in time for the autumn sowing. 516. Military affairs. My informant confirmed native reports of want of discipline among troops in Turkistan, and their disinclination towards the war Ihis is sufficiently illustrated by a recent measure of the Officer Commanding, lurkistan Military District, who calls for bi-weekly telegraphic reports on the following heads:— o r r (а) excesses committed by troops, (б) disposition of men and discontent manifested, (c) relations between officers and men, * (d) causes for discontent, stterTitlctk Ait ijife lortitisefii die bytky basatktfe mL Geml i at tie aid er Kiigliz k ■dered tkiE country, h \\ Ik obi An article® 1 ers at Taste Id not be® nountollk; ibviouslyfe: jig to an ofe t about n-' (e) measures for completing cadres, (f) work carried out, {g) number of desertions, / (7i) sale of arms and equipment by the men. This last offence appears to be particularly prevalent as penal servitude has just been substituted for service in a disciplinary unit for offenders. With regard to reinforcements near the Afghan frontier the informant stated that 2 or 3 regiments have recently been sent to Kushk against eventualities.” The agent just returned from Termez states that there are little more than 1,000 men there, which though doubtless an understatement does not point to any increase. Men, however, are continually coming and going. An armoured car was seen at Kaghan, and was said to be en route for the Afghan frontier. i # E. A. F. REDL, Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staff Officer.

Persian officials. —As the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has no influence in Tehran which would be likely to ensure his continuance in the post of Governor-General we have replied to his request for money (paragraph 1 last week) that some security is necessary. This he is not able to give, so the matter has been dropped. No Governor-General has been appointed definitely, but rumour is again in favour of the Naiyir-ud-Daulah. . 2 h 2 of Diary No. 42, etc.) has been removed from the post oi Chief of Police, being replaced by one Mirza Ahmad Ali Khan. • n 3- Mirza Ahmad Khan, the new Commissioner of Education, has arrived * m Meshed and taken charge of his duties. 4. Persian affairs (local).--M. Kornelis has imported 5,000 kharvars of Govern ment gram from Turbat-i-Haidari, and has published a notice saying that although the Kevenue Department cannot be responsible for the issue of bread at reasonable rates, he has arranged for the supply to bakers of 40 kharvars of wheat and 20 of barley daily, at 15 tumans per kharvar. The notice points out that with this arrangement there should always be a good supply of good bread available for sale at krans two per man. . 5- The order for the suppression of the “ Chaman ” newspaper (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 43) has been rescinded, and the paper has again appeared. 6. Shaji-us-Saltanah left for Jam on the 6th instant with the force mentioned m paragraph 2 last week. 7. Cholera is reported at Gunabad, and the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has telegraphed to Tehran asking for a grant of funds to send out doctors, complain ing that the money spent in combating the outbreak in Meshed has not all been refunded to him. 8. A report has been sent to Tehran dealing generally with the state of the province. Fear is expressed that the autumn rains may fail as none has fallen yet, and the present bazar rates of wheat and barley are given at 45 and 35 tumans per kharvar. 9. Persian affairs (general).—The return of the Persian Cassacks who escorted Kamran Mirza on his departure from Meshed is announced. They created a disturbance at Nishapur, attempting to obtain by force the release of one of their companions who had been arrested on a charge of murder. The matter has been reported to Tehran and to the Commandant of the Cossack force at Meshed. 10. Nothing has yet been done to arrange the affairs of Shirwan. Shuja-ud- Daulah and the Chief of Bujnurd continue to intrigue against one anotherj and until a permanent Governor-General is appointed to the province nothing can be done to reduce them to order. Fresh petitions have been made to Tehran from the Kuchan side asking that Shirwan may be returned to them. IK The Russian Turkomans of the Sarakhs border are still out of hand and committing robbery from time to time. The local Russian authorities seem to be unable to deal with them. 12. It is reported from Khaf and other places that a band of Afghan robbers, well armed, have crossed the frontier. These reports all seem to refer to the German party described elsewhere. 13. The Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has called for a report from the Governor of Kuchan regarding a recent attack by a band of robbers on the Customs office at Bajgiran. 714 The Karasuran on the Imbrani-Gunabad road are still complaining that they have not been paid, and will not work, the road is unsafe in consequence. (The money for these men was appropriated by the late Governor-General, vide paragraph 3 of Diary No. 36.) £ 15. British affairs.— British and Indian goods to the value of Rs. 90,000 have arrived in Meshed during the past few days. Included in this consignment are sugar, spices, indigo, cloth goods, and a small quantity of leather by special per mission. 16. Russian affairs.—The robbery from a Russian subject residing near Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam of 50 kharvars of wheat is reported. This crime was com mitted by Saiyid Haidar, one of the Barbari Chiefs, at the instigation of Haji Husain A g ha ; the latter being a Russian protege an interesting question is thereby raised. 17 Persian and German intrigues.—The local democrats, who are bitterly opposed to the return of Naiyir-ud-Daulah to Khorassan (paragraph 1 above), have warned 13 notables of the city, who are known to be working on his behalf, that they must leave the town before he arrives, otherwise they will be shot. 18 A report has been received by the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik from Turshiz that a body of eight Turkomans with‘three Persian servants have been arrested by the Governor. ° Our Agent at Turbat-i-Haidari, however, telegraphs Jhat there are some Europeans among the party, and that a force of Russian Cossacks have left Turbat for Turshiz. Later news through the Russian Commandant here an- noirices the fact that the eight Europeans are Germans : they must therefore be Wfgnrr and his companions {vide paragraph 28 last week). I visited my colleague this morning (the 10th) and asked what he had done, having received no reply to a note written immediately on receipt of the news yesterdav. He replied that as there was some doubt as to the nationality of the eight he had agreed to the proposal of the Mushawir that the whole party should be retained by the Governor of Turshiz until it was proved that they were Germans. 1 replied that the reverse should be done ; that the party should be made over to the Russian troops on the understanding that they be returned to the Persians in the event of their turning out to be Turkomans. A joint representation to the Mushnwir has now resulted in a telegram being despatched to the Governor of Turshiz, (who. by the bye, is a son of Kamaran Mirza, vide paragraph 3 of Diary No. 40) directing him to forward the party to Turbat-i-Haidari, there to be put in charge of the Karguzar, pending the settlement of the question of their nationahty. This will do. as they will of course be accompanied by the Cossacks who had come from Turbat to Turshiz. 19. Ahmad, the German adherent (paragraph 29 last week), was not sent in by our Karaiz Agent, but was cleverly detected by one of our dak sowars on the Karaiz-Meshed road near Fariman, and brought in to the city by him. He states that he had not accompanied the German expedition from Herat as reported by our Herat Agent, but That he had quitted the town five days^ later. This is borne out by the fact that some of the letters he carried for people in Meshed were dated the 29th ultimo, whereas the party left Herat on the 26th. Ahmad is uncertain as to whether Wagner and his friends intended to return to Herat or not, and informs us that the other supposed guide accompanied them as far as Ghurian near the Persian frontier.* This man, one Faiz-Ullah (not Baid-Ullah) also came to Meshed, apparently, after dismissal by Wagner, but has returned to Herat. Ahmad has been allowed to go, having promised to serve us in future. He carried no papers of importance on this occasion. ^ 20. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —The district is still in a disturbed condition, and Adal-ud-Daulah has given fresh proofs of his incompetence in the position of. Governor. Large numbers of Baluch threaten to emigrate on account of the loss they have suffered through recent thefts if their property is not recovered. 2 i News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —It is suspected that Shaukat-ud-Daulah intends to resist his brother Shaji (paragraph 6 above) on the latter’s arrival. Mas rat-id- Mulk has come in, and there are rumours that Haji Husain Agha is tryiim to stir up a section of the Barbari tribe to take part in the disorders. 822. News ffOTYi Net at. —Kazim Beg told Ids MihwiandaY on tlie 30tli nltinio tliat if WagneT did not return lie also intended to leave Afghanistan, a&gt;nd try to return to his own country via Persia. (This suggests that Wagner intended to quit the country or to return according to circumstances.) On the other hand the Austrian known as Ali Khan (paragraph 28 last week) persists in the statement that Wagner will return, and the latter’s luggage is at Herat ready packed. Another person says that this is a trial trip to see whether escape is possible. Wagner has taken a large number of cartridges with him and has left two boxes among the luggage at Bagh-i-Kartah. 23. Nasrullah, in addition to other false information, has announced that a German general and some Turkish officers have arrived at the Kainat frontiers, and that the object of Wagner’s tour is to receive some instructions from them, after which he will return to Herat. 24. On the 1st of November a syce returned from Ghurian, where he had been dismissed by Wagner. He brought back five mules which had carried barley for the party, and says that the other five had gone on with them, their loads, which were also of barley, not having yet been exhausted. This man brought a note for Ali Khan from Wagner : he professes ignorance as to whether Wagner will return or not. 25. On the 2nd Ali Khan visited Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat-Ullah at Bagh-i-Shah. Later the three held a secret consultation in the garden, taking care not to be overheard, after which Ali Khan returned to Bagh-i-Kartah. Kazim Beg then went to his room and wrote a letter of considerable length to the Naib-ul- Hukumah, which is believed to be on the subject of his departure. 26. To-day the jemadar of Wagner’s escort sent in a sowar who reported that the German officer had crossed the frontier, and had dismissed Jiis escort. It is said that the party have proceeded in the direction of Khaf via Hashtadan and that before crossing the frontier they had dyed their moustaches black. Meshed : | W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, The 10th November 1917. ) His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in KhorassamV / } CONFIDENTIAL. 1. Persian officials .—On the 12th instant it v, r as reported that the Mushawir- ul-Mumalih had succeeded in raising tumans 10,000 (paragraph 1 last week) which he had forwarded to Tehran with instructions that they should be presented to the Ministers as pishkash for his confirmation in the post of Governor-General, but the same evening it was announced that the Naiyir-ud-Daulah who had put up a far larger sum\ had been nominated. My colleague called upon me on the following day and asked me to support a protest which he was making to the Russian Legation on the ground that it was not advisable that a man who had been removed by our means should return to the saihe post. . Meanwhile feeling grew in the town against the Naiyir. A large party of democrats, backed by their influential supporters, assembled in the telegraph office, and various telegrams were despatched to the Ministirs, the democratic society in Tehran, and the Naiyir himself, with a view to prevent the appointment of the latter : and the Najd-us-Saltanah and Salar Nusrat, whom the Naiyir had appointed by telegram to act as Deputy Governor and Chief of Police pending his arrival, were ordered to resign their posts in favour of democrat nominees which were the Mushawir and the present Chief of Police. They resigned accordingly, and no change was made in the Polipe Department; but the Mushawir had already received orders to return to Tehran forthwith, and felt that they should be carried out. He left the city accordingly on the 15th instant, having paid farewell visits at the Consulates General. At about three hours after sunset on the night of the 14th an attack was made by three men, masked and well armed, on the house of the Najd-us-Saltanah, evidently with the object of taking his life. He happened that evening . to be entertaining a number of friends among whom was Salar Nusrat, and although the Najd himself escaped injury Salar Nusrat was dangerously wounded in the abdomen, and for some hours his life was in danger. In addition to this casualty one of the Najd’s servants was killed, and one or two other persons slightly wounded. Apparently in revenge for this outrage a bomb was thrown at the telegraph office from a carriage which was passing on the evening of the 15th by some person whose identity has not transpired but the bomb exploded harmlessly. The Persian Government have apparently given way to the agitation, as we hear this morning that the democrats have received notice by telegram that the appointment of the Naiyir-ud-Daulah is cancelled, and the Karguzar has been ordered to carry on the duties of Governor-General pending the arrival of some other selection. 2. Persian affairs (local ):—Prior to his departure the Mushawir telegraphed to the Home Office that the pay of the provincial Karasuran should be raised as it was not sufficient to keep them in these days of scarcity. He pointed out that the unsettled state of the province was due to the lack of zeal shewn by these men. &lt; * / 3. The Tehran War Office has ordered a census to be taken of all troops in Khorassan, whether regular or irregular. 4. Persian affairs (general).—Revolts from Darajaiz shew an improvement in the affairs of that part of the province. Wheat is sold at 35 tumans per kharwar by the Revenue office, whereas the bazar rate is from 45 to 50. 5. The condition of Kuchan and Shirvan shews no improvement. Tne robber Khuddu has again been active, and owing to the strained relations existing between Shuja-ud-Daulah and the Chief of Bujnurd, and the patronage of Khuddu by the former, no change is likely to be seen in present circumstances. Kuchan district is generally in an unsettled condition, several raids are reported with which the Governor shews no inclination to deal.: ! f;' ■ 6. British affairs.—The value of the goods imported into Khorassan from India during the month of Mizan (September 24th to October 23rd) amounts to about five and three-quarters lakhs of rupees at 40 krans to 15 rupees. This brings the total of the past four months up to nearly 23 lakhs, a very satisfactory amount. The question of a “ fourgon ” company will now be taken up, as we hear that the railway from Nushki will be extended to Mirjawa early next year. 7. Russian affairs .—M. Antipoff, Russian Vice-Consul at Turbat-i-Hakhri, is under orders for transfer to the Foreign Office to Petrograd. He is being relieved by a M. Maximofi who has left Meshed to-day : he is young and gives a favourable impression. 8. Two Russian Cossacks created a disturbance on the night of the 11th instant at the police station in the Sarab quarter and were with difficulty removed to the Russian Consulate-General. Persian and (j&amp;rmnn intnrjucs .—The man \ad-ullah is not Ab'J-nr-Rahman (paragraph 21 of Diary No. 43). ’ The latter is evidently still in Tehran. 10. A pro-German pamphlet has been picked up in the bazar : it appears to have been distributed in the city. The paper contains extracts from the recent trial of the Russian General Sukhhmoff from which it is attempted to prove tnat the Russiam mobilisation was,solely responsible for the outbieak of the great war. The writer, with a curious change of theme, ends by shewing from ancient state ments of Russian political leaders that England is really Russia's chief enemy and has exploited h .r during the past three years for her own benefit. This paper was not printed in Meshed. 11. The matter of the Germans at Turshiz (paragraph 18 last week) has been hopelessly mismanaged. The Russian \ ice-Consul at lurbat-i-Haidari does not seem to have interested himself in the least, and the latest neus received this morning (17th) is that the Germans ha\e escaped and that the Russian troops are returning to Turbat. The local events detailed in paragraph 1 abo\e ha\e prevented much attention being given to this matter by Persian local authorities, and a full report of what actually occurred at Turshiz is anxiously awaited b/us. Meanwhile further remarks would be superfluous, but my colleague has again distinguished himself by a policy of inaction in circumstances requiring something very different. 12. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—Vmxiz Khan, the local Police Superin tendent, has been dismissed, and ’Itizad-i-Huzur appointed in his place. 13. News from Turbai-i-Shaikh Jam.—Shaji-us-Saltanah reached Mahmudabad on the night of the 11th instant (see paragraph 6 last week). A few shots were exchanged between his party and the men of Mir Baki Sultan whom Shaukat-ud Daulah had appointed Governor of Mahmudabad, after which Mir Baki retired to Jam. Shaji then sent his Persian Cossack escort to Jam with a message to his brother to surrender at discretion, but the latter refused and is making preparations for resistance. Shaji has sent in to Meshed for reinforcements, Shuja-ul-Mulk having with his usual astuteness declined to take either side. Other chiefs are said to be coming to Shaji’s assistance, but no attention has been given to this, matter here owing°to the local crisis above described. It will be taken up again to-day or to-morrow, an Acting Governor-General having been appointed. 14. News from Herat .—The arrival of 8 natives of Bokhara on pilgrimage to the shrine of Hazrat Kurkh is reported from Bala Murghab. The Naib-ul- Hukumah has refused to allow them to enter the country saying that the times were not suitable for pilgrimage. 15. Thirty families of Uzbaks have returned to Bala Murghab from Russian Turkestan to which they had emigrated from Afghan Turkestan some time since on account of ill-treatment by the Governor. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has now allowed fhem to settle in Bala Murghab. 16. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has appointed some secret agents to tour his districts with a view to report on the conduct of his subordinate Governors and frontier officials. . . 11 &amp; if*! 2!) | 4 ^ c ar. . 3 17. On the 2nd instant the Naib-ul-Hulcumah and Akifr &gt;SaZar while riding together met Kazim Beg who asked why they allowed a British Agent to live in Herat, giving as a reason for his expulsion that he constantly reported concerning the German party who were the guests of the Afghan Government. Kazim added that they might at least restrain the Agent from makinv such renorts The ‘iite He^'^ Naib-ul-Hukumah replied that the British Agency was instituted 40 years ago and was not merely for the purpose of watching the Germans. ? ; S!fc;&gt;; r.r Uj 18. The return to Herat on the 3rd instant of the Austrian “ Mirza ” with the Risalah sowars who escorted Wagner to the frontier is reported. 19. It is established that the party who crossed the Perso-Afghan frontier in company with Wagner were Bayer], three Austrians known as Ghulam Riza, Franz and Hinden, and three Persians, Abbas Ali, Ismail and Ghulam Riza, with probably a guide. The route taken was that given in naraerranh 28 nf Hiarv TsTn Ul i '’-iir-PiL ' Tefaa ^ 44, and the frontier was actually crossed from the Chaharyak post. Wagner has placed the remnapt of his band under the orders of “ Mirza.” iZi* ■ It 4T». ctsbn^fc T)*^ fr, ,,._ ■ feomcij L'Sa’j rv^. t 20. On the 4th the Jemadar of Wagner’s escort visited the Naib-ul-HuJcumah who questioned him regarding the party. He said that Wagner and the Austrians dyed their moustaches, hair, and eyebrows black and before crossing the frontier put on long skirts of coarse cloth and overcoats such as are worn by nomads. They changed saddles with the Risalah sowars, and replaced their stirrups with pieces of string and the horses’ headgear with pieces of rope. Their rifles were concealed mk. under their overcoats, and two or three of them carried swords bound by string to their shoulders. kstiwc . ■I'Hi'iir. fa ’; liie Biaate Tapi 1 ak: j- 21. On the 5th Mirza paid 200 krans each from Wagner to the head servant - and farrsah who had been with him. 22. It appears that Wagner before departure packed all his papers and anti quities in boxes, locked and sealed them, and delivered them to Mirza, directing him to guard them with the utmost care.

Nasrullah has given out that Wagner will soon return to Herat with Usmani troops, and will march on to Shaikh Junaid. 24. Kazim Beg continues to announce his approching departure, but some say that he will go via Russia, and some by the route taken by Wagner. He is believed to be waiting for news of Wagner to arrive before starting himself. ktd ^ 1 • r «r f let! fS Meshed : W. G.

Nothing more has teen heard regarding the supposed nomination of the Kawwam-us-Saltanah as Governor-General beyond that the Cabinet is again in a precarious condition and his departure is therefore delayed. Meanwhile the Sardar Intisar continues to hold the position of Deputy, and as he is at present suffering from a prolonged attack of fever-said to be the result of worry caused by repeated attempts to reconcile the democratic and an^'-democratic parties -—the condition of affairs is not satisfactory. The Karguzar has had a relapse and has been recommended to leave Meshed without delay for a change of air. •u ^ Persian affairs (local). —The aw^’-democrats (paragraph 4 last week) are still in the telegraph office, and are said to be determined to remain there until their demands have been satisfied by a responsible reply from Tehran Thev are now decided in favour of the return of Naiyir-ud-Daulahas Governor-General^ and have again telegraphed ; this time formally refusing to accept any other nominee. n t u?’ -P n Fnda y’ the 22n(i i^ant, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Redl, C.I.L., Lieutenant-Colonel Hawley, Commanding the 28th Light Cavalry Maior Pemberton, Commanding the detachment of the 19th Punjabis, and Captain Uloth, Adjutant, 28th Light Cavalry, paid an official visit to the Acting Governor-General on the occasion of Nauroz. 4. Much rain and snow has fallen during the week, and rejoicing is general; but prices show no sign of falling, and the expenses of living are quite unprecedented for Meshed. There are frequent demonstrations on the part of the poor, and it seems that our example has at length induced the richer classes to arrange some form of famine relief. Our own work in this connection is dealt with elsewhere. 5. Persian affairs (general).—The War Office have ordered the despatch of 100 sowars to Darajaiz who will be sent on to Askabad for the protection of the Karpardaz and Persian subjects in the event of their position becoming worse (paragraph 15 of diary No. 10). 6. British affairs.—One squadron (less one troop) of the 28th Light Cavalry • under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. B. Hawley, with the headquarters of the regiment, arrived at Meshed from Turbat-i-Haidari on the 20th instant and the remaining troop came in on the 23rd having been delayed by bad weather. We had received information that the ten prisoners mentioned in paraoraoh 15 last week were to be despatched to Tehran by carriage on the 19th instant • and knowing that an advanced party of the 28th Cavalry were to be at Sharifabad on the Tehran road on that date, we sent out a request to them to search all carriages and take over the prisoners, if found. It unfortunately happened that M. Melnikoff, the Meshed manager of the j Moscow firm of Yakubi Zorgagen, had selected that day to proceed to C Turbat-i- S Haidari on business, and his carriage on arrival at Sharifabad at 7 p.m. was stopped by a cavalry patrol and the occupants, M. Melnikoff and a young assistant, ordered to descend. The assistant gave no trouble, but Melnikoff drew a revolver and the Indian officer of the party, who had come to that side of the carriage, supposing that his life was in danger, fired with fatal effect. The corpse was brought into Meshed and the funeral on Thursday the 21st was attended by a large majority of the European community. Much sympathy is felt for the family who are here at present. 7. A large and increasing number of paupers are fed daily on our premises, the total yesterday amounting to no less than 3,250. It is not easy to find bread for such a large number, but with the ever ready assistance of M. Kornelis I have succeeded in purchasing 130 kharvars of wheat from the Maliyah office at Karaiz at a much reduced rate specially allowed on account of the object. When this consignment reaches Meshed there will be no further difficulty.2 8. Russian affairs.-tt. de Beauvais is taking advantage of the unfortunate occurrence described in paragraph 6 above to resume his abuse of the British, amoncr his Persian friends, and 1 have heard from several sources that he has stated that the death of M. Melnikoff was not an accident. He is not_the_only Russian • ^r r i mn.Vina matters as unpleasant for us as possible. 9 In response to an urgent telegram a further detacbment of the Persian Cossack Brigade with four machine guns left Meshed on Monday last for Shalirud to reinforce that mentioned in paragraph 12 last week It is supposed by local people that they have gone to escort the late Shah, Muhammad Ah, to Tehran: he having according to rumour, returned to Persia recently md Astarabad. 10 There appears to be renewed fighting at Bokhara between the Amir and the Bolsheviks and it is reported that the former has sent 10 mullas to invite the help of the Amir of Afghanistan. It is not yet known what reply His Majesty intends to give. imong the local Caucasian community it is said that the Bolsheviks intend to attack tie Caucasus when they have compelted the subjugation of Turkestan and Bokhara. 11 There is a rumour from Askabad this week that a force of escaped prisoners, well armed, under a Geiman officer of distinction, has assembled there with the intention of attacking Meshed. Another report says that the party is composed of Bolsheviks, and that their object is to deal with the Russian officials who have refused to recognise their authority : but m each case a descent upon Meshed is said to be piobable. It will be int resting to know what, if anything, forms a basis for these reports. 12. The local branch of the Russian Banque d’Escompte expects to close down shortly, and the principal employes are preparing to quit Meshed. Some wish to find employment in India, and others to proceed to Europe tia Bombay or Karachi. Two young Cossack officers will accompany the first party which will leave in a few days. They expect to find military work in France. A. 13. Persian and German intrigves. —The prisoners referred to in paragraph 6 above have not yet left the city : transport not having been procured. There is believed to be a Turk at large in the town, but no sign of the large influx of such people, which we feared might follow the disorders in Turkestan, is yet apparent. Measures will be taken to capture the ten men who are in custody when their despatch is finally arranged. Meanwhile I hear that they are being starved, as everyone declines to pay for their food knowing that the chances of recovering from Govern ment are extremely small. 14. In the democrat meetings this week the conduct of the Bolsheviks at Askabad was discussed, and approval of their kindness to the committe of de mocrats there was expressed. It was decided to threat-en the Meshed grain holders and force them to part with their stores at a reasonable price : similar measures having been taken, so it was stated, in Tehran with distinct success. All efforts on my part and that of our friends to bring the extreme democrat party to reason having failed, I am now advised to ask for the deportation of Haji Muhammad Ja’far Kashmiri, Shaikh Kazim Balm* Farush, and the latter s son Shaikh Ahmad, the editor of the “ Bahar ” newspaper (paragraph 17 of Diary No. 2) : and I have tried to see the Sardar Intisar on the subject, but have not yet succeeded on account of his indisposition mentioned above. 15 News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—The British Agent has returned to Turbat after a'visit to Alyak with Major Lang on levy recruiting duty (paragraph 8 last- week). 16 The Governor of Turbat has asked Tehran for a cypher to enable him to report secretly on the doings in that neighbourhood of our troops. He complains of our work among the local tribes, and suggests that they will become bold under our patronage and refuse to pay revenue and other taxes.S=£ m 11 force tiag ijs tktkpr Med. kfi- ce: pn success. 17. News from Turbat-i-ShaiJch Jam. —Further cases of extortion by Mir Baki Sultan are reported. The local authorities beg us to wait for the settlement of Jam affairs until the arrival of the long expected Governor-General, but it will be necessary to take some steps when our levy detachment destined for Jam becomes available. 18. Mirza Ismail, recently interpreter to the Russian Medical Officer stationed at Karaiz, has shown our Agent a document which he has received from the Vice Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari purporting to appoint him Consular Agent a Karaiz with permission to fly a Russian flag and to engage six sowars and a farrash. This order is said to bear an official seal. 19. News from Herat. —The Naib-ul-Hukumah has appointed an agent to keep a careful record of all refugees from Persia, with the lands or service given to them by the Afghan Government, and to check such record once a month, reporting to him the names of any persons who may be absent. 20. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered that no foreigner should be allowed to bring arms for sale in Afghan territory. 21. Thirty ponies laden with iron have been sent in to Herat by Rissaldar Yar Muhammad Khan from the Frontier. . “ 22. The governor of Bala Murghab has sent in to Herat eight Turkomans who had been deported by the Russians. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has despatched them to Maimanah, directing that a receipt for them be taken from the Governor of that place. 23. On the 9th instant Kazim Beg informed the Naib-ul-Hukumah that some American ports had been captured by the Germans, but the Naib declined to believe the story. On the same day Asghar, Kazim’s servant, purchased skin bags which he said were for the conveyance of ghi on the journey which his master was about to make. 24. On the 10th complaints were made by the commander of the escort provided for the Austrians that the horses were used for carrying stones from the neighbouring hills, and that many of them had in consequence sore backs von Gruden seems determined to find some mineral deposits (vide paragraph 26 of Diary No. 9). 25. The Austrians and Kazim Beg have made purchases during the week of articles which are obviously for use on a journey, but from a remark made casually by von Gruden, which our Agent reports, the departure of the party does not seem yet to have been definitely decided upon. 26. Our Agent again remarks upon the treatment now accorded to him by the Naib Solar and his subordinates who habitually watch his actions. He ascribes the change in their demeanour to some cmta'-British articles that have recently appeared in the “ Siraj-ul-Akhbar. Meshed : ') M. G.

There is feeling against M.

He is said to have arrived (30th), and will be watched. 4. There have been several bread riots during the week, and consistent effm-ta I are made to persuade the common people that the scarcity of bread is caused bv the presence of British troops in Khorassan but with little success. ThereTs no doubt that the large numbers of paupers who now assemble daily on our premises are a sourceof danger and an arrangement is now being made to ensure the presence of matter m howeve? “ ^ ‘ S ^ each da ^ Tilis is no! - *4 nfficf’w 6 awa ' democra * P art y have still some representatives in the telegraph office, but according to the latest reports they seem now disposed to accept the Kawwam-us-Saltanah us Grovernor-GrenGrul. ^ , , 6 - Penwn affairs (general).—k report from Khelat states that Haii Khan brother of Fath-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Khelat, has raised a body of 30 to 40 ruffians, and is raiding the villages round Chahchah. M Brigadier-General Dale, who was expected to arrive at Meshed on the 24th instant, has apparently met-with bad weather, as there is no news yet of his reaching Turbat-i-Haidari. The weather has now cleared up but the roads must still be m very bad condition. 5 8. This same bad weather has interfered with our arrangements to brinp 1 in stores of gram for the garrison, and some little inconvenience has resulted which has unfortunately been increased by the attitude of the Persian troops and—I regret to say—that of the Persian Cossacks. Several cases have occurred of forcible4i;; i ULl I 'M ISR. detention and removal to Persian barracks of stores purchased and paid for by ns. and a partv of Cossacks actually seized a dozen mules which we had engaged to send to Bin and where thev are urgently required, notwithstanding the protests of the men in char^p. All these incidents have been amicably settled however; and in the case of the mules Captain Sergaief called to apologise and was allowed to keep the animals in view of the extreme urgency of the move of the Cossacks to Shahrud, and the fact that mules were difficult to obtain. 9. I have been approached by the representative of the Armenian firm of Tamanientz on the subject of motor transport of merchandise from Sistan to Meshed, and it is hoped that something may be done when the railway extension to Mirjawa is opened for general traffic. 10. Russian affairs. —The Karqazar informed our Attache that certain Pvussian subjects (no doubt under the influence of M. deBeauvais) had urged him to take up the case of the death of M. Melnikoff but that he had declined, saving that it had nothing to do with the Persian Government. This unfortunate matter is to be referred to a mixed military court with. General Dale as president, on the arrival of the latter at Meshed. There seems to be no doubt that a verdict of justifiable homicide will be brought in : but as Colonel Scouratt is to be one of the members, some difficulty may perhaps be experienced ' from him. 11. More was said on the subject of Bolshevik designs upon the Caucasus at the meetings of the Caucasian community held during the week, and the imiversal opinion seems to be that a descent of the Bolsheviks upon Tiflis, etc., will follow the Bokhara operations, about which there does not seem to be further reliable information. 12. Three more Pvussian officers, having escaped from Bolshevik hands at Taganrog, have arrived in Meshed. I have not yet met them, but my colleague intends to bring them over to-morrow. 13. Persian and German intrigues. —The 10 escaped prisoners mentioned last week are still here ; subscriptions are now being raised for the expenses of their journey to Tehran. The Turk said to have been in the town (paragraph 13 last week) 'wandered into our escort lines in search of food, and is detained. 14. The discussions held at democrat meetings in these days are almost all on the subject of the British and British troops. The editor of the “ Bahar ’ is writing a history of British intrigues and the various methods employed by them to become possessed of their colonies. He remarked again this week that we were reallv responsible for the bombardment of the Shrine in 1912, and urges the democrats to take speedy measures for poor relief, as the effect of our work upon the people is bad for the cause. Nothing having resulted from this persuasion, he is now representing us as having bought up large stores of grain in order to increase the general distress. 15. yews from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Our Agent and Major Lang have returned from Alyak, but I have not yet heard the result of their recruiting work, beyond that the Karais would not enlist on the terms offered. I regard this as of little importance, and agree with Major Lang in admiration for the Barbari as a fighting man. 16. The Russian telegraphist has brought the telegraph line into the Russian Vice-Consulate, ostensibly for the sake of convenience. 17. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —The withdrawal of Mir Baki Sultan to Kila Chak is reported. He has left his brother in charge of his aflairs. Further intrigues are said to be on foot between this man, the Ilbaigi Kaudani, and Shaukat- ud-Daulah. 18. News from Karaiz. —On the 18th instant Mirza Ismail (paragraph 18 last week) made an unsuccessful attempt to get possession of the cloth and stick of the Russian flag which the medical officer had sold by auction on his departure from Karaiz. The purchaser said that he had burnt the stick, and made the cloth into small pieces; The Mirza has evidently had orders to establish himself as a sort of Consular Agent.fy-?-- 19. News from Herat. —Tlie Naib-ul-HuTcumah has again ordered the imprison ment and periodical public beating of certain thieves captured red-handed. 20. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered that the last year’s revenue in certain places may be recovered from this year’s produce : the prospects for the next harvest being excellent. 21. Further trouble between von Gruden and Kazim Beg is reported: this time on account of Ivazim having prevented a town photographer from seeing yon Gruden when he had come to Bagh-i-Kartah for that purpose. Upon find ing out what had happened von Gruden wrote to the Naib-ul-Hukumah declin ing to live any longer in the same place with Kazim. The Naib gave a non committal reply. 22. von Gruden dismissed his head servant on the 16th instant, on the ground that he habitually talked about their doings in the town. 23. On the 17th Kazim Beg approached the guard of Bagh-i-Kartah while they were at drill, and informed them that the Afghan Government had been .invited by the Russians to take possession of Panjdeh which formerly belonged to them, but that the Afghans had not the courage to comply with this in vitation. The officer in command replied that he and his men were not afraid of fighting, and would go anywhere when ordered. 24. On the 18th von Gruden accused a farrash employed at the Bagh-i- Kartah of talking about his affairs in the bazar, and induced the mihmandar to change him. 25. The Maulvi Barkat-ullah is said to have made a translation of the Surah “ Amma ” (Kuran), and to have proved from the text that the Christians are the natural enemies of Islam, and that they had destroyed various sacred places of that religion. He presented a copy of his treatise to the Naib Solar, who is said to have been pleased with it. 26. On the 20th Kazim Beg complained to a late mihmandar of Bagh-i- Kartah that his party were much more carefully watched now than formerly and asked the reason. The mihmandar denied that they had any cause for complaint. 27. The newly arrived German (paragraph 30 of Diary No. 11) has been ordered by the Naib-ul-Hukumah to build a boat: he having, apparently, gifts as a carpenter. 28. There is nothing this week about a move: the impression given in the week’s reports is that the party are so carefully watched and their doings so general ly known that they prefer to defer departure.

Press, Simla.—No. C61FD—1-5-18—30 M.D.w lilt! .If ' 1 our troops. As hintod above, the appointment of the Kawam has strengthened democrat hands, and I hear that Saiyid Haidar, the Barbari leader, now refuses to provide any sowars for the levy corps, and that he has written to the local Government stating that the British had asked him for sowars, but that as a loyal Persian subject he had felt it his duty to refuse. This report lacks confirmation at the time of writing, and I trust that it is false, but this party of sowars have not yet left for Kain. $ Democrat societies everywhere are both hindering our purchases of grain as much as possible, and exaggerating their extent and mis-representing our objects. We are buying to a limited extent in advance, i.e., supplies to be furnished when the approaching harvest is gathered in, and a report is being circulated that our object in doing this is to ensure prices remaining high even after the harvest in order to increase want and suffering. 9. We have had to limit the number of paupers fed on our premises (paragraph 7 of Diary No. 12) to 2,000 daily, owing to the irregularity hitherto experienced in the supply of bread. We have plenty of money still, but sometimes it has been found impossible to provide bread for more than half the applicants, and the local authorities have on one or two occasions complained subsequently that the unsuccessful applicants have made a disturbance in the town when obliged to go awav hungry from us. This has in fact happened, and the people have made it clear to their countrymen that their anger is directed against them and not against the British. In view of action now being taken (see above), it is hoped that this difficulty will now cease. 10. Russian affairs .—General Dale has declined to preside over the mixed commission for enquiry into the circumstances attending the death of M. Melnikoff (paragraph 10 last week) and his place is to be taken by myself. The case is prac tically at an end, everyone being apparently satisfied ; but my colleague, while assuring me that he did not wish to see any one found guilty, begs that His Majesty’s Government will make some provision for the widow until she re-marries. This question is being considered. 11. Bolshevik successes in Turkestan have sobered the Caucasian party in Meshed, who are more than ever convinced that the Tiflis Government will also be subdued in its turn. There are also renewed reports of parties of Bolsheviks coming to Meshed (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 12), but they appear to be worthy of little credence. 12. M. Gerold, manager of the pre-war German firm of Stucken and Co., wool merchants, died on Sunday last of typhus fever which he had apparently contract ed while engaged in the inspection of wool. 13. The Governor of Sarakhs has again asked for 25 armed sowars to protect him from Turkoman raids which he expects to occur at any moment now that there is no longer a garrison of troops at Bussian Sarakhs. We have not yet occupied this locality. 14. Persian and German intrigues .—At the first secret meeting of democrats held during the week the feasibility or otherwise of certain schemes for dealing death to the British troops in Meshed was discussed. Nothing was agreed upon, ana the attention of the company was then drawn to the desirability of spreading as widely l as possible the news of the bombardment of Najaf Shrine by British troops. It was suggested that the point which should be made clear to all was that whereas the Russians in their attack upon the Shrine of Meshed merely made some holes in the dome, the British had completely destroyed that of Najaf. As the second meeting, prior to which the news had been received of the appointment of the Kawam, mutual congratulations were exchanged upon this appointment so satisfactory for the democratic cause, etc., and considerable delight was expressed that the nefarious schemes of the British, who had been supposed to we working for the Naiyir-ud-Daulah, had come to nought. It was then said that we had desired to have no Governor; and a reference was made to my visit to the Sardar Intisar reported last week it being stated that the Sirdar resigned after that visit at my instigation#G. M. Press, Simla. ~Xo. C 92F.D. -11-5-18—30—M.D. report has been received that the extreme democrats have specially engaged cer am persons to excite the populace against us. An agent was walking a few ays ago m the Bala Khiaban when he saw a woman lying at the side of the road e\ i en y dying of starvation. A company had gathered round her, and a Cauca- sian was explaining to them that the price of wheat had now risen to 75 tumans per arvar owing to the action of the British in buying up and storing immense quantities : that the British did not intend to leave any grain for the people of the country, etc. r r 15. During the past week I received an account of a visit paid by three promi- nen emocrats to my Russian colleague, with the primary object of enquiring from him what the behavior of our troops here was likely to be. As usual he seems to have given no reply to their questions, but to have told them that he would Help them if necessary but that it was their place to see that our men’s conduct was good by takmg measures to restrain them from acts of oppression. 16. Neivs from Karaiz. On Saturday the 30th ultimo some severe shocks o earthquake were felt both here and Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam : at the latter place snmp nmiQP.Q wo-ro ^ some houses were destroyed. . ' ^ 17. A caravan which recently arrived from Herat contained, as one of its passengers, a Barbari named Ghulam Nabi who was recently in the service of the German party at Herat and was dismissed by them on suspicion of being the spy of our Agent. The latter suggests that we might now find him useful here, as he can recognise all the party and their staff. 18. News from Herat. —The Naib-ul-Hukumah has issued new and stringent orders against the admittance into Afghan territory of any foreigners without his permission previously obtained. 19. The death of the Governor of Girishk is announced. 20. On the 23rd ultimo von Gruden ordered his servant Abbas Ali to purchase Jwo loads of charcoal, but when asked for what purpose they were required replied that that would be known later. His suspicion of his staff seems to be increasing. 21. On the 24th ultimo the German party received two letters from the Austrians at Kabul. One was addressed to Wagner, and the other to Kazim Beg. The former was opened by von Gruden. 22. On the 25th idem Kazim Beg visited the Naib Solar (who is indisposed), and told him that large numbers of British troops had come to Kermanshah en route to Hamadan with a quantity of automobiles. Kazim expressed much fear at this development, which he said would increase a desire to revolt which had already been seen to exist among the Kurds. 23. von Gruden once more complained to his mihmandar that his party were not allowed to pay any visits, and that any person who came to them was at once imprisoned ; and remarked that they were more like prisoners than guests. He received the same reply as that given on a former occasion, wz.,that they were not allowed to visit Afghans for fear that the latter might shew them some disrespect. 24. On the 28th the Persian servants of the German party requested Kazim Beg to approach the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the subject of a trade in young girls which has recently sprung up between Meshed and Herat and which they said gave their nation a bad name. Kazim replied that poor inhabitants of Meshed sold their children on account of poverty which at the present time was caused by the act of the British in having bought up all available grain and stored it with the object of causing distress to the Persian people. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent fo the Government of India in Khorassan.Meshed Diary No. 1$, for the week ending the 13th April 1918. T ** Persian officials. —General Dale and I exchanged visits with the Sardat n isar during the week. He was friendly, but a trifle shame-faced : evidently lere had been some truth in the reports of his rapprochement with the Democrats, e matter is not serious, in view of the impending arrival of a Governor-General. 2. Shahzadah Murtaza Mirzacalled on us on the 12th instant: he promises to be friendly and helpful (paragraph 2 last week). 3. Persian affairs {local). —On the 9th instant a demonstration was made at the house of Aghazadah, the chief mujtahid, in connection with the supply of bread. It was engineered by the tmri-Democrats, Caucasians, and Azarbaijanis, who were jomed by a large number of beggars, and the attitude of the mob was such that the Aghazadah was obliged to flee from his house and hide in that of his servant. From the premises of the Aghazadah the company proceeded to the Shrine, where they were eventually dispersed by the Sirdar Intisar who promised to take immediate measures to reduce the price of bread. This he did by raising a public subscrip tion, but the relief lasted for two days only, and further disturbances are probable, unless grain can be brought in from some outstation without delay. Transport difficulties are unfortunately against this. 4. Persian affairs (general).*—The Chief of Bujnurd has declined to come south-to meet the Kawam-us-Saltanah on his journey to Meshed ; giving as reasons for his refusal disturbances on his frontiers and the difficulty of obtaining fodder and other provisions. 5. The Shikari and Zushki robbers (paragraph 8 of Diary No. 9) recently captured by the Sardar Intisar are still in confinement in the artillery barracks, with the exception of one who has been released and allowed to return to his home near Chinaran. On the reappearance of this man in the Chinaran neighbourhood a number of the inhabitants of the surrounding villages despatched a circular tele gram to all the notables of Meshed protesting against his release and urging the adequate punishment of the remainder. It seems likely that the remainder will be disposed of upon the arrival of the new Governor-General, who will probably shew misplaced clemency and make money at the same time. 6. British affairs.* —Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan, has paid in 3,000 tumans to the Imperial Bank of Persia on account of the second instalment of his debt to them (paragraph 12 of Diary No. 43 last year). I hear that he will soon pay the remaining 4,000 fearing that I may induce the new Governor-General to dismiss him in the event of delay. 7. The value of goods imported into Khorassan frotn India during the month of Hout (20th February to 20th March) amounted to no less than 11J lakhs of rupees—a record, which brings the quarterly total to nearly 21 lakhs. Sugar is now being re-exported from Meshed to Tehran, and more than half this month’s total value represents sugar. 8. Major Rahman, I.M.S., D.A.D.M.S., left Meshed for Turbat-i-Haidari on Tuesday the 9th instant, and Brigadier-General Dale and Captain Hornsby, Brigade Major, on the 12th. The carriage in which the latter left Meshed is reported to have broken down near Rabat-i-Safid, and they have just sent in for another. 9. We are still much worried in regard to the supply of grain and fodder for the newly arrived troops: scarcity, lack of transport, and Democrat influence (though the latter is the least serious of the three) being al] heavily against us. M. Kornelis has felt compelled to hand over the office of Revenue to Mirza Ghulam Husain (paragraph 2 of Diary No. 13) under protest, not having received a satisfactory reply to his references to Tehran on the subject of his ejection from offics, and the new pishkar is reviewing the arrangements I had concluded with M. Kornelis, w r hich causes delay, although he does not appear to have any definite-' ly unfriendly object.10. Russian affairs.— On Tuesday night last both my colleague and M. de Beauvais were dining at this Consulate. At about 10-30 p.m. the former, taking me aside, stated that he had just received reliable information, in confirmation of reports previously received, that the Caucasian party headed by de Beauvais and the celebrated Mir Murtaza, had decided to eject him from his position and Con sulate the following morning at 10 a.m., and begged me to take urgent steps for his protection. I approached the General Officer Commanding, who was staying in the house, and arrangements were made for the roads in the. neighbourhood of the Russian Consulate to be patrolled from 10 to 12 on the morning of the 10th, and for a small force of infantry with a machine gun to be m readiness in the same I locality, during the time mentioned. As a result of these measures (so I am assur ed) nothin^ occurred, and the general effect is good in that all parties see that our troops are not here for nothing, and that we are determined to support our friends. M ae -Beauvais has this morning sent a message through a Persian friend that he wishes to call and apologise for his conduct, but my colleague having at an interview two days ago been openly defied by his subordinate, and having asked me to treat him coldly for the present, I have sent an indefinite reply to this communica tion. H i n view of the relations now supposed to exist between Russia and the Central Powers the question of certain exports to Russia is being taken up. For the moment there is no export except by post, owing to transport disorganisation and other difficulties, but perhaps it may be necessary to buy up stocks of such articles, as wool and cotton and details of existing stocks are being collected. 1 During the week a party of nine persons, Russians and Russian Jews, have arrived : from Askabad, according to my colleague, in connection with arrangements fio feed Askabad city, which, according to recent reports, is badly in need of relief. They profess to have come for dried fruits only, but are also said to be enquiring anxiously for wool and cotton and are being watched carefully : daily reports of their doings being sent in to me. 12. Fighting is reported to be in progress at Baku and Tiflis. At the former place the Bolsheviks are bombarding the town from one or two small gunboats lying in the harbour, and the residents, who have no artillery, are making what defence they can with rifles and other small-arms. A truce is said to have been made between the Bolsheviks and the Amir of Bokhara, but according to the latest report it has come to an abrupt conclusion and hostilities have re-opened. 13. Enquiry shows that there is no foundation for the rumour that a force of escaped prisoners of war had assembled at Askabad and were contemplating an attack on Meshed (paragraph 12 of Diary No. 12). 14. It was stated during the week in a meeting of Caucasians that the Bolsheviks of Askabad were only waiting for the recognition by the Persian Gov ernment of de Bravine as Russian Minister to proceed to Meshed and remove M. Nicolsky from bis post of Consul-General. 15. Persian and German intrigues. —The Austrian and Turkish prisoners mentioned in paragraph 13 of Diary No. 13 are still in the Karguzari, and their number has been increased by the arrival of three more. They are apparently now being detained until the arrival of the new Governor-General, w r ho is expected in ten days. 16. The chief topic of conversation at the democratic meetings during the past week was our famine relief work. The large number of persons fed daily having been commented upon it was suggested that out popularity was increasing at a dangerous pace, and that it was no longer confined to the very poor but was extending among the well-to-do in consequence of their sympathy with our philanthropy. It was urged that no time should be lost in arranging for the price of bread to be reduced to 3 krans per man. (This is what we want, but unfortunately the same thing has been said before and nothing has been done). 17. News from Karaiz. —Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakharz, is busily engaged in enlisting sowars for the protection of the frontier. This question, which has been pending for so long notwithstanding Shuja’s efforts, with our assist ance, to obtain the sanction of the Persian Government, has at length been decided3 . o sinal iiw are nialoiij!* ad tokek rdiBgtotkk •e re-opd. ur tkafoitsi :oDteinp!aii2 asiaas tk» tieFeisk 1 ^ a 3 and I suspect that the formation of the Khorassan branch of our levy corps has St? srx S'Srxs—=“•“ • 1 ” t h ?

On the 30th idem Kazim Beg met the Naib-ul-Hukumah out riding and communiGated to him some news of importance, showing him at the same time one ° u e e J s Teceiv ®d from Russia. The Naib made no comment. It is not known w a this mformation may have been, beyond that the following day one of the servants stated that Kazim had received a letter describing the re-capture of Baghdad from the British by the Turks.

Intelligence Summary No. 11 for the week ending the 16th March 1918. . 75 !* British force.-—2 platoons and machine gun detachment of the 19th Punjabis under Captain Adams reached Meshed on the 13th and 14th instant, the camel transport of the party having been delayed by heavy rain on the last stage. 76, Persian ^ossack Brigade .—Under orders from Tehran 200 men of this formation were despatched on the 13th instant to Nishapur, Colonel Meshetich himself leaving the following day. The caravansa^ija^ required for our troops was thus automatically vacated, but it had been found necessary to request the Officer Commanding Division at Tehran to repeat his orders to hand it over to us, the Officer Commanding Brigade still affirming non-receipt of the original order. 77. ^m 0 «&lt;?&gt;\?.--The 7 Austrians are still at the Karguzari. The Karguzar has received instructions to send them to Tehran. On the 15th instant an apent telegraphed to me from Kuchan that 3 Turks had left for Meshed with an escort of 2 savars. They had been sent in by the Governor of Daragiz, and were taken last night to the house he owns in the Bala Khiaban whence one, stated to be an officer, was removed to the house of Sardar Intisar this morning. He finally rejoined his companions. # As they were actually escorted in by 5 savars it was considered politically advisable to await a more favourable moment for taking them over. 78. Local affairs .—The Askhabad road—particularly between Kuchan and Bajgiran—is infested by brigands belonging to various bands. Members of a party of Russian refugees who recently arrived from Askhabad were molested, but eventually allowed to proceed unrobbed. Three native travellers have been killed by robbers on the Dushakh road. Munshi Nizam is said to be trying for the post of Chief of Police at Meshed, but there seems no probability of his success. He upraided the towns-people for their pusillanimity in permitting the arrival of British troops unchecked. He has identified himself with the Union and Progress Society. and Austrian party continue. According to a statement by Barakatullah they intend to leave via Russia after Nau Ruz. The recently arrived German is confined to Bagh-i-Kartah pending an answer re his case from Kabul. The forward and tactless conduct of Kazim Beg has again given offence to the Naib-ul-Hukumah. According to information received from London there is a possibility that Wagner might receive instructions to return to Herat, and in that case it is very possible that he would again avail himself of the services of Mir Zabi Khan The agent at Mazar-i-Sharif reports that Mohendro Partap crossed the Oxus to Russian territory on February 14th, his subsequent movements being Khorasan and North-East Persia. \ Herat and Afghanistan. 79.

Many Persian refugees have reached Askhabad and may be expected here shortly. The Bolsheviks, by rumour assisted by Austrian prisoners, are said to have looted both Old and New Kokand very completely. The papers stated that the looting was done by adherents of the autonomists during their flight. There is little doubt as to which version is the more probable. During the week I received information tending to show that matters were coming to a head between the Amir of Bokhara and the Bolsheviks, and later reports stated that the former had destroyed the railway both near Kizil Tapa towards Samarkand, and also near Charjui, thus isolating the Bolshevik forces in Bokharan territory, which by accounts received are not very numerous. A report from Merv dated the 7th instant stated that it was understood there that fighting at Bokhara had already begun. Owing to the interruption of the railway direct information was obviously unobtainable. An arrival who left Charjui on the 11 th instant reports that fighting was in progress, that 200 Russians had been killed and that the Amir had captured 10 guns and ammunition from the Bolsheviks who were unable to receive reinforcements owing to the interruption of the railway. The Bolsheviks vrere reported to be guarding the Charjui bridge. This report cannot be accepted as more than a rumour at present. At the same time from all accounts the Amir should have at his disposal some 15 to 20,000 men of doubtful quality, but who would greatly outnumber the Bolsheviks on the spot. Kushk Fort is reported to have been practically evacuated by Russian troops, and this is confirmed by two Russian officers who were prominently concerned in the fighting at Tashkent on the side of the Provisional Government, and who have just succeeded in reaching Meshed after many adventures. Their account of Bolsheviks procedure up to the present is that they have a striking force of 3,000 to 4,000 men whom they transfer from place to place as required. They have also command of all artillery in Turkistan. Their funds are abundant as they have plundered all banks throughout the country, and their leader—Kolessov, formerly a small railway employe—does not shrink from employing money freely when expedient. He recently secured many adherents at Askhabad by the expenditure of the 11 million rubles which he had previously looted, in satisfying the demands of the railway employes—a solid asset to Bolshevik man-power. As they are entirely ruthless and the natives have failed to organise, they have hitherto been able to enforce their will upon the latter. Russo-Persian and Russo-Afghan frontier posts have been abandoned. Meshed; j6th March igi8SECRET. £f ; f r ^ i U Q i 3 Intelligence Summary No. 12 for theweek ending the 23rd March 1918.

The dead man proved to be a Russian, and was the representative of the firm of Zurgagen and Co., on whose business he was proceeding to Turbat-i-Haidari. In the past it was our invariable practice to notify the Russian consular ana mmtary authorities here whenever a British traveller was proceeding along e line of Russian posts, the military as a rule providing an order for assistance and escort m case of necessity to all post commanders. Had the Russian Consul-General thought of adopting a similar course of action under the present circumstances this most unfortunate occurrence would nave been avoided. a i v* v* J * rms Sheikh Ali Akbar Sarraf, post contractor on the Meshed- Askbabad road, is reported to have purchased some 2000 rifles in Transcaspia tor d5 tomans and to have despatched them to Kuchan where he is dis posing ot them for 50 tomans each.

In spite of rumours little appears to have occurred in Transcaspia beyond general and universal insecurity to life and property. Looting has occurred at Merv following on the Bolsheviks taking over the conduct of affairs there. Their guns have been mounted at Tashkepri station commanding the southern portion of the line thence and the road from Takhta Bazar. E. A. E. KEDL, Lieut.-Colonel, General Staff OfficerJ SECRET. ' - t Intelligence Summary No. 13 of the week e L.-t 30th March 1918. Khorasan and North-East Persia. 95. Local affairs .—The acting Governor-General Sardar Intisar has tele graphed his resignation largely owing to attacks on the count of an^lophilism made on him in the Tehran paper Naubahar. On Persian authority 'Qawam- as-Saltanah will shortly leave Tehran to take up his appointment at Meshed as Governor-General, but there appears room to doubt the exactness of this information. Much anti-English feeling is expressed at present by local derrccrsts fomented by,the speeches of M. de Beauvais, 1st Secretary to the Kussian Consulate-General, and possibly by others of our allies. Many rumours of the actual or the proximate return of Muhammad Ali Shah to Mazandaran are current in the town. The grain question is again acute, and there is talk of a possible riot. Muhammad Beg Jamshadi, brother of Sayyid Ahmad Beg has been the guest of the Kaudani Ilbegi and of Mir Baqui Sultan from each of whom he received a present of a horse and of wheat. Inhabitants of Jam have been ordered bv their head-men to purchase arms according to their means. 95 rifles are said to have been recently acquired at Mahmudabad. One Aghabala Khan is said to have enlisted about 150 men at Nishapur to whom he is himself issuing horses and rifles. Four persons in Turkoman dress reached Zorabad from Eahnah-i-Zulfiqar, hut shortly afterwards received a message from and returned to, the latter place. Owing to the shortness of their stay there was no means of identifying them. Hoads in the north and east of the province remain very insecure and the neighbourhood of Bajgiran is much disturbed. 96. German and adherents ,—Latest news from Herat makes no mention of the forthcoming departure of the Turko-Austrian party except inasmuch as von Gruden has dismissed one of his own servants and asked for the removal of an Afghan^ Jarash as he suspected both men of being too free in their speech regarding his doings. Kazim Beg began to have his horses exercised by night but has discontinued the practice.

Punishment is promised to those intriguers to whose inducements this defection was due. He has received a letter from Major Khuda Baksh Khan announcing his arrival in Russian territory. The officer offers to purchase for the ^aib Salar nronerty of a Russian general which is being sold by auction, and a large sum has been sent him through Risaldar Tar Muhammad Khan for this purpose. The Naib Salar anxiously awaits orders from Kabul to send troops to Russia and has expressed his intention of putting the hathtyak (1 per 8 men) eouscription in force very shortly. 98 Frontier —A jamadar has been ordered to patrol the frontier from Gulran to Ghurian and to report the result of hi* observations. The measure appears to have special reference to smuggling. It is also stated that one company per infantry battalion at Herat will shortly be sent on frontier duty. Russian Turkistan. 99 Current eccnte.—Little can be added to the information recorded last we (i k as there is still a complete cessation of communication of any sort from east of the Oxus. Further reports contain much the same information and the actual situa tion at Bokhara is still obscure. The Bolsheviks apparently dominate the town under threat of bombardment which, according to latest reports, had not vet occurred. The majority of the population are rumoured to nave fled with their valuables to other places. At Karakul a massacre of the few Russians there is said to have occurred, followed by a Bolshevik bombardment and very sanguinary reprisals. From Transcaspia the Bolsheviks continue to send up railway and tele graph material to repair the damaged lines, and it may be assumed that the same procedure is being followed from the Samarkand side. There have lately been rumours of an influx of Austrian prisoners to Askhabad, but enquiries on this head have given no confirmation. Telegraph conversations up to yesterday report Askhabad to be quiet and the Austrian prisoners to be in small numbers—it is said under 100 there. Although under existing circumstances such conversations have little value per se they are m this case confirmed by reports from other sources. A fugitive Russian officer here who at one time commanded a large prisoners camp in Turkistan and has had later opportunities of studying the question states that since the revolution, and particularly since the rise of the Bolsheviks very large numbers of the prisoners have drifted away from Tur kistan. He estimates their present minimum number at 3,900, and in Trans caspia at a few hundred only There is, however, no reason why taose still present should not concentrate in Trarscaspia, but they could hardly have done so recently owing to the interruption of railway traffic. A telegram which reached me this week from Merv and concerning which I await further details stated that Austrian prisoners were intriguing at that plac?. The fact of the arming of the Austrian prisoners by the Bolsheviks appears to be doubtful The officer in question who took a prominent part in the Tashkent fighting in which war prisoners were reported to have participated does not regard the fact as established, a recent arrival from Kokand who reacheda k» t a , to at E® ^ unafi* K?i tlie itte! k ntly bmkk sports, bis to usTe U itokTewnl reprisaia railfay uift ism im pwBt nation jBii ik inP 13 ff jitlcj that town just after the bombardment states that although Austrian prisoners were present m the town they had taken no part in the fighting, and a compe tent observer denied a recent rumour that Austrians at Askhabad had been armed. At the same time this is no guarantee against the future as arms can e procured m abundance, and with organisation, which with German penetra tion will not be lacking, much could be done.

The following extract from a letter posted to me by a friend from the Russo-Persian frontier on the 27th ultimo may be of interest as throwin 0, li^ht on Bolshevik methods of procedure. “ Kelessov, the chief Bolshevik commissioner of Tashkent, reached Askhabad on the 21st February. He was accompanied by 600 Red Guards— a set of ragamuffins of all ages, armed with all sorts of rifles, Russian, German and Turkish. They were like nothing so much as the sans-culottes of 1789 ! His first care was to dissolve the Musalman committee to which about 200 troopers of the Turkoman Hivision adhered. They had all retired to Kashi as a protest. About 5 p.m. a strong detachment of the sansculottes with 400 to 500 Bolshevik soldiers, taking with them several guns, proceeded to Kashi. About 7 p.m. 6 rounds of artillery were fired—probably blank, and the next morning we heard that the members of the committee and the Turcomans had submitted to Kolessov’s orders. The Bolsheviks carry out frequent searches in the houses of the Russian and Persian musalmans, which is nothing more than an excuse for pillage. I do not think that the musalmans will suffer this treatment for Tong ; their patience is almost at an end, and only yesterday I heard that a revolt is in course of preparation. The situation is as bad as it can be. A report was current that the Bolsheviks had armed the Austrian prisoners at Askhabad. This is untrue; I personally saw the latter walking quite peacably about the town. The soldiers of the 30th Frontier Guard Brigade have abandoned the posts at Gaudan and Kurt Su, and the Customs officials are preparing to leave partly on account of the insecurity and partly, because they can obtain no flour. The post Commandant informed me that they w r ould be replaced by Turkoman jig its but I do not credit this. frontier is completely close to all goods, bolh exports and imports, and it is said that it will shortly be closed to travellers. The Bolsheviks have requisitioned the money at all Askhabad banks, and forced the State Bank to pay them 11 million rubces. The Banque d’Escompte, Russo-Asiatic and Sarkisbekov’s handed over very little, most of their funds having been previously disposed of.” Meshed ; The 18th March 1918. 1 E. A.

April 12th. —Major Meadows, A. V. Corps, returned to Birjand from Kain. April 13th. —Captain Sinton, V.C., I.M.S., reached Birjand. It is rumoured that this Province is about to be made subordinate again to Khorasan. It is also said that if Kawam-us-Saltaneh becomes Governor-General of Khorasan, Shaukat-ul-Mulk will be deprived of this Governorship and either Hisam-ud-Dauleh or Samsam-ud-Dauleh will be appointed in his place. Hisam is supposed to have already been offered the appointment and to have refused it on the ground that his tenure would probably only last a few months. Ebtihaj-us-Sultan, Revenue Director, left Birjand for Sistan on about the 9th instant. He is accompanied by Afkham-us-Sultan, the head of the Deputy Governor’s office in Sistan. On the 8th instant a rumour reached Sistan from Neh that robbers were com-’ ing up from the south towards Madeh Karez. The maldars oi the latter neighbour hood had begun driving their flocks into Kunik in a panic. It has subsequently been ascertained that the rumour was fabricated and spread by the Baluch graziers of Sawari and Wali Dad Kohi to frighten the maldars of Sistan and Neh out of their country. About the same date a rumour reached Birjand that Idu Khan Baluch of Sistan (? dismissed Jemadar of the Sistan Levy Corps) was starting on a raiding expedition and that some of his scouts had been seen near Sar Chah. As the man is very much under the influence of Sardar Khudadad Khan, I do not think that there can be any truth in the rumour. A rumour from Khur reached Birjand on the 7th instant that 150 Hasani raid ers had approached from the west to within 16 miles of Bahabad. (1) On the 11th instant a dozen Afghans came into Deh Dost Muhammad from across the border and raided, first the house of the Mian Kangi Mujtehid, Mulla Abdullah, binding the hands and feet of his son, and then the house of Meshedi Said Khan. All the valuables in both houses were carried away. The trail of the robbers is said to have been subsequently followed through Deh Makaki to the cantonment at Kala-i-Kang.

The anticipation that this Province was again about to be made subordinate to Khorassan is said to have been confirmed. It is rumoured that Kawam-us- baltaneh, the G overnor-General designate, has summoned Shaukat-ul-Mulk to Meshed. I am informed that the son of Sardar Asad, Minister of Posts and Tele graphs, has warned Shaukat-ul-Mulk, who is his friend, by telegraph, not to strug gle against the arrangement. ® Suspicious Characters. Six itinerant Tabrizi Turks were recently arrested by the military at Gunabad and brought to Kain for examination. They proved to be quack doctors nos sessing a passport (? travelling permit) from Tehran and credentials from various Russians. They were released and will presumably come on to Sistan. The Finance Department. Ebtihaj-us-Sultan, the Provincial Revenue Director, reached Sistan on the 18th instant.

The ring has been returned to him with the usual explanation and expressions of regret. Tribal fighting in southern Khorassan. News reached Kain on the 11th instant that Ibrahim Khan’s Baluchis of Gaisur have attacked and captured Murad Khan and two other Shebak Baluchis and carried off a considerable number of their camels and sheep. News from Afghanistan. (1) The military forces in the Herat Province are said to have been very largely increased during the last few months. The present numbers are estimated at 12 regiments of infantry (600 men in each), 3 regiments of cavalry (400 in each) 600 sappers and miners and 5,000 or 6,000 Khawanin sowars—total at least 14,000 men. The soldiers in Herat are freely committing burglaries. Most of their old officers have been displaced.(2) The Kala-i-Kang troops are said to have received a small increase of pay the addition of one Kabuli rupee (2 Krans) and 4 mans of wheat per mensem is mentioned. The re-armament of the troops is progressing. (3) It is rumoured that the Afghans intend to construct new frontier posts at Pani-Chahi, Khushaba, Shorawa and Yazdan. It is said that they will demand revenue of Hisam-ud-Dauleh and Samsam-ud-Dauleh for their te-ez-cultivation at Yazdan and Kabud, Local Military News. The Persian military forces in this province have received no pay for many months and are very discontented in consequence. The camel contingents would like to enter our service. German Emissaries. It is said that some 10 Germans have recently come to Herat from Kabul. Their possessions were loaded on 120 mules. The floods in Sistan.

(2) See Diary No. 4. It appears that Abdus Sam ad Khan, the Afghan Karguzar for Sistan, had [gone to Kabul in connection with a private land dispute against Abbas Khan Reki of Ibrahimabad. The latter has now been dispossessed of his property. He is said to be contemplating a migration to Sistan with hi* tribesmen. Neics from Birjand. (1) See last week’s diary. The murderer Mahomed Nasir Khan is still at large. He is believed to be in the vicinity of Gunabad. In 1916 this individual was Deputy Governor of Khidri, when Hisam-ud-Dauleh was the Provincial Governor, and incurred our displeasure on account of his inactivity at the time of Zal Beg’s raiding a mule caravan which was bringing down Hazara recruits and «ome British Indian travellers to Birjand.

(2) The Governor of Sabzawar is said to have been relieved of his appointment. (3) It is rumoured that a reinforcement of 500 infantry under a “ Turk ” named Ghaffur is coming to Sistan from Kandahar. Birjand affairs. I have been discussing with Hisam-ud-Dauleh the two big family claims out standing against him since the deaths of his father and his step-mother Jamil-us- Saltaneh. In the one case, Samsam-ud-Dauleh, Deputy Governor of Sistan and half brother of Hisam-ud-Dauleh, has long been invoking my good offices ; while in regard to the other His Majesty’s Legation have been interesting them selves on behalf of Asad-ud-Dauleh, a relative by marriage of the deceased lady. When I reached Birjand the negotiations between the two brothers — through Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s endeavours—had been fined down to a dispute over about 6,000 Tomans’ worth of land and the question as to which brother should be liable for the Russian Bank’s claim of 3,200 Tomans. I have got both brothers to accept a settlement under which Samsam will receive 4,000 Tomans’ worth of the land in dispute, while Hisam will also pay off the debt to the Bank. The nominal value of Samsam’s share of the estates is 85,000 Tomans. The actual distribution of the villages, according to their values already agreed upon, is now to be made by Shaukat-ul-Mulk. As regards the estate left by Jamil-us-Saltaneh I am compelled to refer certain points to Tehran, and cannot hope to get the case finished until 1 next visit Birjand. Meteorological. Good rain, amounting to 57 cents, has fallen this week in Sistan. Outside the oasis rain has fallen generally and the grazing will, it is hoped, be saved. F. B.

The Karguzar of Sistan. In Birjand I was informed by Shaukat-ul-Mulk that Fakhr-ud-Dauleh was about to be relieved by Saad-ul-Mulk, a Mirza of the Foreign Ministry. This arrangement has since been apparently cancelled, as the Karguzar has heard that Saad-ul-Mulk has been appointed to Ramadan. The Russian Vice-Consulate. This post is apparently being abolished for reasons of economy. On my arrival in Birjand I was informed by M. Boulatoff that it had been proposed that the charge of Russian interests in Sistan and Kain should be entrusted to me, and a few days later I received authority by telegram from His Majesty’s Minister to take over from my Russian colleague. On the 20th March the formal transfer was made and the certificate signed. Beyond countersigning the pay-bills and other accounts of the Russian Telegraphists and pressing Hisam-ud-Dauleh periodically to pay up the Russian Bank’s claim there does not seem to be much work in the charge. The Persian Telegraph Department. A telegraphist, named Mirza Ali Khan Sarhang, reached Birjand from Meshed on the 23rd instant. He there relieves Mirza Mahomed Ali Khan, who is said id be going to ojpen a new office at Koh Malik Siah. Mirza Ali Khan used to be in Sistan five or six years ago. Meteorological. Twenty-nine cents of rain fell in Sistan during the week. The Helmand River is coming down in flood, and considerable portions of the oasis are likely to be submerged. The Nurab channel has begun to overflow its banks, rendering the motor road between the new bridge and Deh Kul village impassable for several hundred yards. F. B.

A man from Chahar Burjak has stated that two German agents, natives of Turkestan, have recently left Chahar Burjak for the British border to inspect our posts up to Dalbandin. Floods in Sistan. The expected floods have appeared all over the oasis. The Mian Kangi district; is mostly under water, and cut off from all communication with the rest of Sistan. Some of our camels which were grazing there are marooned, and brushwood, which is badly wanted for the repair of bands and of bridges, is unobtainable. Both the main roads from Lutak to Sistan, i.e., via Muhammadabad and via Chiling, are impassable and likely to remain so for two or three months, the whole country watered by the Bud-i-Sistan from Sharik westwards for a distance of about eight miles being under water for large areas. The only passable road now is on the extreme west of the oasis via Tuti and Deh Taqi. On this there are many jabs (canals) containing water but fordable. The Naizar, south of the Hisamiya- Dashtak road, has not yet filled with water from the Helmand, though the recent rain has made the passage very difficult for animals and impossible for motors. News from Afghanistan. (1) It is said that Sardar Gul Mahomed Khan, the Governor of Chakhansur&gt; has been summoned to Kabul, and that he has been told to leave his family behind. (2) Sardar Ata Mahomed Khan has been ordered to submit frequent news reports to Kabul about Persian Sistan. (3) There has been trouble recently in Kala Kang between the Brigadier and his infantry over the withholding of the latter’s pay for four months. The Brigadier ordered two Dah-bashis and some sepoys to be flogged, whereupon a large party attacked his house, smashing his doors and causing him to take refuge in the Qazi’s house. (4) It is said that Abdul Majid Khan and Ghulam Nabi Khan, Nurzai Sardars, have been arrested and taken to Kandahar for non-payment of arrears of revenue. Gun-runners. It is reported that Wali Mahomed Khan and Mahomed Sharif Khan, Alizais, have recently returned to their homes from Quetta. Amongst other merchandise they have brought fourteen breech-loading rifles. Russian affairs. The Russian Telegraph ghulams at Kain have been fighting with the Director of Excise. The latter is said to have first beaten a ghulam for smuggling opium, upon which the Russian Telegraphist at Khaf advised the ghulams to beat the Director. The latter has since complained to Birjand. I understand that M. Boulatoff has been discussing the case with the Governor. News from Birjand.

The anti-democrats, however, remarked that the British were their friends and that the Aghazadah was supporting their enemies, and left his presence in disgust. T u, 3 'i^ et a ' lotll «r new society has appeared in Meshed, known as the Radical ji era 'Y• announce that they are anti-democrat and are working for the reformation of Persia. Their proceedings are being watched, and will be reported upon. 4. The Sardar Intisar informs us confidentially that he has received a cypher telegram from Tehran announcing the appointment of the Kavvam-us-Saltanah as Governor General of Khorassan, but we have not heard this from anv other source. J 5. The Eais-ut-Tujjar (paragraph 5 last week) has also approached the anti- democrat party, asking them to support his opposition to the Naiyir-ud-Daulah , usmg the same argument as the Aghazadah.

Persian affairs {general ).—Bajgiran is still in a disturbed condition, owing to the ill-feeling which has formerly been mentioned as existing between the Chief of Bujnurd and the Governor of Kuchan, and some fighting is reported to have taken place during the week in which three lives were lost. 7. British affairs.— On the 4th instant the “ Bahar ” published a special edition announcing the fall of Baghdad and the retreat of the British in the direc tion of Basrah ; having apparently received the information by telegram from Tehran. Some of the extreme democrats at once tried to organise illuminations and general rejoicing, but met with no success as we had already heard that the rumour was false and issued a contradiction. D S ' Tlle acting Governor General has received a cypher telegram from the 1 resident of the Council directing him to prevent any action against British troops as the question of their entry into Persia is under discussion at Tehran. 9. Information has been received that the infantry detachment which has been detained at Turbat-i-Haidari left that place this morning (March the 9th) and is due on the 12th instant. The Headquarters and one squadron of the 28th Cavalry are due at Meshed on the 20th idem. 10. Russian affairs. —The question of the Caravanserai mentioned in para graph No. 15 of Diary No. 7 is not yet settled. The Commandant of the local Persian Cossack Brigade professes to be only awaiting instructions from his chief in Tehran to hand it over to us, while we hear from Tehran that such orders were m | i...despatched some days ago. We have now asked for the orders to be repeated from Tehran. It is curious that there is at least as much dissatisfaction shown by our Russian allies at the coming of our troops as by the Persians themselves, as if we had been responsible for the departure of their own, which we had worked hard to prevent, 11 There has been a slight increase in the price of roubles in the city this week on account of the report thatv peace with the Central Powers is imminent. The rate is now about 8 tu tyuiihs per ICO roubles. 12. The Persian Cossacks have received the necessary instructions for charge of certain wmrk outside Meshed city {vide paragraph 11 last week). It will be f^ujid convenient to employ them for the protection of. mam roads and the occupa tion of important posts which may not be included in our military programme. 13 It is reported from Sarakhs that 12 families of Russian Turkomans have come across the border with the intention of becoming Persian subjects. 14. A raid on the Customs premises at Darajaiz wdth some loss of life is reported. The criminals in this case were Turkomans, among whom there is undoubtedly much unrest. 15 Complaints against the Maximalists have reached Meshed from Askabad, and the Persian Agent has asked his Government for a detachment of troops to guard his house and to protect the interests of the Persian traders resident in Askabad. 16 Persian and German intrigues. —Seven escaped Austrian prisoners have been sent in to Meshed by the Governor of Kelat. IRe Karguzar on a request from me that they should be handed over for despatch to India has telegraphed to Tehran for instructions. If the reply is not satisfactory some arrangement w r ill be made to recapture them when they leave Meshed for Tehran or elsewhere. 17. Aghazadah is much disgusted wdth the democrats wRo declined to comply with a request from him to murder the editor of the “ Chaman who had pub lished a defamatory article concerning him ; the reason for non-compliance given is that the editor has become a British protege, which is of course incorrect. 18. At one of the weekly meetings of the democrat society it w^as decided, in view r of the answer of the Sardar Intisar to the proposals made (paragraph 19 last week), not to oppose the entry of our troops into Meshed, but to watch their conduct towards fl e peojle carefully and take aetkn later should it be necessary. The lists of arms in possession of democarts were perused : they show 336 arms of different kinds, of which 143 are breech-loading rifles, and 157 revolvers and Mauser pistols. 19. Two persons, one a Tehrani and the other a Kermanshahi, have arrived m Meshed end are collecting money from the democrats for the manufacture of bombs and cartridges, at which they are said to be expert. Their movements and work will be carefully watched. 20. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —The arrival is announced of Major Lang, Commandant of the Khorassan—Sistan Levy Corps, on recruiting duty. He is due at Meshed to-day on a short visit for consultation. 21. News fro 7 n Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Saiyid Muhammad Beg Jamshidi is reported to have ccme to Turbat with some sowars, and to be entering into rela-. tions with the llbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan, whom he has asked to give him seme place of habitation. It is said that on obtaining ihis he will send infor mat icn to Saiyid Ahmad Beg who is at Chaman-i-Bid, and that the latter will then bring the families of both to Turbat-i-Jam. It will probablv be well to station some levies at least at Jam if this arrange ment is carried into effect. 22. The Naib Karguzar of Karaiz has arrived at Turbat. He has been ins-, tructed to prepare lists of all losses suffered by the inhabitants of Jam at the hands of Russian troops during the sojourn of the latter in the neighbourhood.Turbati-Htidari^'n^'^T 116 RUSSian , d ° Ct0r with W3 escort Ieft ^-dzy for Finance officiak' q 13 ar6 “ be ° CCUpied ^ the local Custom/and The haraiz post of the Sanitary Cordon is now closed. ™iJk 0 A stlZ{ r Tthi e Kh~ lt k rep0rted t } iat Ae intends to tion and other p ri^gS ” m ” t0 tllat ° f re § ul « 3 “d give them promo- HerafKfndara^r^d^ln^onL^ the Rabat-i-Ghurian-Kabul and and Miners has arrived from Kabuh 11 Whl ° n ^ &amp; Subedar o£ Sa PP- reported.

Pres?, Simla.—No. C.25P.D.—13-4 18 —29 E.A.32 A l ^ ! 3 j 3 Meshed Diary No. 11 , for the week ending the 16th March 7918 1. Persian officials. —No official confirmation of tlie report that Kawwam-us- Saltanali had been appointed Governor-General of Kliorassan has reached Meshed, and meanwhile the partisans of the Naiyir-ud-Daulah are gaining confidence. The democrats have again telegraphed to Tehran saying that the latter will never be acceptable to them. 2. Mushar Daftar is appointed Rais-i-Maliyali of Tun and Tabas. 3. Basar-us-Saltanah, the recently dismissed Rais-i-Maliyah of Sistan, has arrived in Meshed en route for Tehran. _ 4. Persian affairs (local). —There is no change in the situation as regards the anti-democrat party, who are still in occupation of the telegraph office, much to the annoyance of the officials of that department. The leader of the protesting party has presented me with a bill for 250 tumans, the cost of the telegrams which have from time to time been sent to Tehran by him and his friends since their agitation commenced. It came quite as a surprise, as the agitation was in no way engineered by us. It has not been paid. 5. On the 12th instant a large number of paupers waited on the Aghazadah and formally accused him of having collected money for their relief and misappro priated it. They appear to have compared our relief work favourably with that of their countrymen, and urged that as the numbers with whom we could deal were limited some urgent step should be taken to supplement our efforts. 6. Persian affairs (general). —Nothing has been done to restore order in Bajgiran (paragraph 6 last week). As already stated in these Diaries this will have to await the arrival of a Governor-General, as this portion of the district is not included in that which will come under our military influence ; unless, as has been proposed, it is taken in hand by the Persian Cossack Brigade. 7. British affairs. —The editor of the ' 4 Bahar ” (paragraph 7 last week) with intentional discourtesy published our contradiction of his announcement that Baghdad had been retaken by the Turks in an obscure place in his journal, and has since reproduced from the “ Nau Bahar ” of Tehran a long and circumstantial account of the bombardment of the Najaf shrine by British troops recen 'y. I protested to the Sardar Intisar against this reproduction, but he replied that in this country there was no penalty for reproduction. The case of this irreconcil able will be considered later, with that of one or two others whose deportation may eventually be necessary. 8. Major Lang, Commandant of the Sistan-Khorassan levy corps, with Lieu tenant MacManus, Quartermaster, paid a visit to Meshed during the week for the purpose of consultation regarding the composition of the corps and the distribution of the detachments designed for Khorassan. Recruiting for the levies is proceeding very satisfactorily ; the Barbari leaders in particular shewing every disposition to help. 9. The detachment of the 19th Punjabis (half a company with a machine gun section) mentioned in paragraph 9 last week arrived at Meshed on the 14th, , having been somewhat delayed by bad weather. There was no demonstration on j the part of the population, merely a little curiosity was exhibited. The arrival ; at Turbat-i-Haidari of the cavalry destined for Meshed is reported. 10. Certain parties in Meshed having heard of the recent success gained by the Jangalis at Resht have telegraphed to Mirza Kuchik Khan offering their services if he wishes any opposition to be organised against the British in Eastern Persia. Shahzadah Hashim Mirza, an ex-democrat who has now become our friend, in the course of a long visit to the Consulate on the 14h, informed me that while the Turks were in occupation of Hamadan in 1916 they despatched 6 agents disguised as Persians, of whom my informant believes 4 were Turks and 2 Germans, to work I ■ij iflil iv namong tlie Jangalis : that these agents had not returned to Hamadan when the Turks were forced to evacuate it: and that they are no doubt largely responsible for the present condition of affairs ; being, so far as the Shahzadah is aware, still in the Jangali country. 11. The value of imports from India during the month of Dalu (21st January to 19th February) was over six lakhs of rupees, which shows that our commercial position is being well maintained. Of this amount about four and a half lakhs represent goods imported via Sistan: which, allowing for the fact that the Afghanistan route is more difficult in winter, suggests growing popularity for the other. 12. Russian affairs.—The caravanserai question (paragraph 10, last week) has been settled in our favour. It appears that, as I had supposed, a local intrigue to keep us out of it had been organised, probably by my colleague acting under the influence of M. M. de Beauvais and Colonel Scouratt who, disregarding the efforts we had made to retain their own troops in Meshed, make no secret of their disgust at the change of forces. The Commandant_ of the local Persian Cossack Brigade assured us that he had not received instructions from] his Tehran superior to hand over the premises to us, and there is no doubt whatever that he had received the'orders several days before giving this assurance ; unless indeed the telegram conveying them had been suppressed by the Russian Consulate-General. The Commandant, with a force of some 200 men, has left Meshed for an unknown destination, probably Shahrud. There was some excitement in the town at the departure of this party, the general opinion seems to have been that they were going out to oppose the advance of the British troops in Khorassan. 13. Great disorder in Russian Turkestan is reported. It is said that at the recent capture of Khokand the Maximalists killed 2,000 Muslims and made no less than 60,000 prisoners. Numbers of refugees have reached Askabad, many of whom are Persian subjects ; and the Persian agent has appealed to Tehran for instructions, both in regard to the subjects themselves and also the recovery of their property raided by the Maximalists. Two Russian officials, one of whom was the Com mandant of the Cadet College at Tashkent, have made their way to Meshed ; their information has been reported separately. 14. Persian and German intrigues. —The Karguzar of Bujnurd has telegraphed to the Karguzar of Meshed announcing the despatch to Tehran via Shahrud of 11 Austrians and 2 Bulgarians on the 8th instant. He states that with great difficulty he induced the Chief of Bujnurd to pay 76 tumans for their expenses, and asks the Meshed authorities to bear such expenditure in future, as the Chief declines to pay anything further. We have written to the Chief regarding this matter, proposing an arrangement which it is hoped wull relieve the Persian authorities from the trouble and responsi bility involved. 15. The seven Austrians mentioned in paragraph 16 last week are still in the Ivarguzari, but the Karguzar has received orders to send them to Tehran. He will let us know wdien they are to be despatched. The arrival of three Turks on the evening of the 15th is reported. Enquiries are being made as to their whereabouts and intended destination. On the arrival of our cavalry a permanent settlement of the troublesome question of escaped prisoners arriving in Khorassan will be made if possible. 16. Another unsuccessful attempt has been made by the democrats to induce the party now in the telegraph office (see above) to lay aside their grievances for the time being and to join in a movement against us, and also to combine in some arrangement to carry on the local government pending the arrival of a Governor General. The reply shows that the democrats have now little hope of effecting a reconciliation. 17. The arrival in Meshed of one Ahmad Agha, sometime Rais-i-Maliyah at Tun and formerly an active pro-German, is reported. He wns deported by the Russians two years ago for his activities, and is mentioned in German reports and diaries. He will be watched.approval^ the s^ppos^LtSrofTh 01 &lt; ! e . mo ® ra . t3 daring the past week dis- +Iia j ^ their fnends in Tehran in receiving bribes from Sf 3 « saar#** ir£&amp; be belt to n W f ^ ttat the « eneral ^ionwas that it would save some rlefinir t ^ lltlsl1 troops by misconduct towards the people of Meshed aCad^Teen made)^ (S6e Paragraph 18;laSt W6ek : ^'decision had Haji Muhammad^ jX 'y placi^su^^^aS as^beyInway of^ur^urhiase'of ^ain and and barley from Government stores.

M.

Two men having been found guilty of robbery and murder have been blown from guns by order of the Naib-ul-Hukumah. , . 27 : Kazim Beg offended the Naib-ul-Hukumah by inviting him to a public festival, which was held on the 1st instant, as his guest. He remarked that it was he who should issue such invitations and not Kazim, and did not attend sending a message to the Naib Salar who had accepted KazinJs invitation asking him also not to be present. Kazim and Maulvi Barkat-ullah waited for a time^and then returned home in disgust. 28 • T? 16 Maulvi stated on the 3rd instant that he had received a letter from Kabul which reported that one of the Austrians (an officer) there had tried to create a disturbance (of what kind or for what reason is not stated), and that the Amir had now placed the Austrian guests under certain restrictions, at the same time handsomely rewarding the person who reported to him the intention of the culprit. 29. It seems that the Austrians at Herat have engaged semi-permanently two men as messengers, and that the Naib Salar allows the two to keep their horsesin his stable so that they can slip away without the knowledge of our Agent: also that the Naib pays for the keep of the horses m question. on The Naib-ul-Hukumah has refused a request from von Gruden to allow the newly arrived German (paragraph29, last week, etc.), to walk out. He isnot to kave the Bagh-i-Kartah until the Amir’s orders m regard to him have been received. SI On the 4th instant Kazim Beg sent a message to the Nciib-ul-HuJiumah asking for an interview, which request was granted and an hour was fixed. Kazim, however did not appear, and told a servant whom the Naib sent for an explana tion that he was busy and could not come. This piece of incivility appears to have been in revenge for the incident described m paragraph 27 above. 32 On the 5th a Barbari messenger brought Kazim Beg a communication from Russian territory which seems to have pleased him. This Barbari stated that the Russian guards on the Panjdeh and Shaikh Junaid frontiers had all been withdrawn. • ura w ii. 33. During the three following days the party appear to have been engaged in various preparations for departure; purchasing boots and articles of clothing, and giving directions regarding the provisions necessary for a journey. They now announce that they will start after Nau Eauz m about a week), and will travel via Russian territory to their own countries. The Maulvi will presumably accom- pany Kazim Beg. Meshed : -) W.

Germans and adherents.—There are no indications this week of a proximate move on the part of the Turco-Austnans. . Barakatullah had a confidential interview with the Naib^ul-Hukumah, their conversation being carried on in Hindustani. With reference to the news-sheet noted in paragraph 40, the information of the British Agent is that it is printed in India and received at Herat from Kabul. He has had no opportunity of identifying it. 67. Military affairs .— Three maxims, three mountain guns and three field guns were taken for field-exercises to the Maulvi Jam hills on the Ifith ultimo. The Naib Salar has announced his intention of inspecting Non-Com missioned Officers shortly and of promoting the most efficient up to the rank ofwnriff X Captain. He propose, that all promotions below the rank of Kumaidan should be made locally. Some manuals, despatched by the Muin-as-Saltanah from Kabul, have been • iT nfflcers They appear to contain patriotic and religious instruction 'TiLnrmtZ and lay Xess on the importance of keeping internal matters “ re^t from foreigners 7 When mastered by the officers the contents are to be communicated to tbe troops. 68 . Current ofoie*.—According to a telegraphic conversation with Askhabad yesterday the Bolsheviks maintain their supremacy m Turkistan, and are said to be in'the ascendant at Orenbure. The Central Asian and the Tashkent-Orenburg railways are now both working althongh there is said to be no communication with Russia beyond Baku on the one hand and Orenburg on the other. The reopening of the Orenburg line may, however, to some extent relieve the serious scarcity prevailing throughout Turk.shtan especially in the matter of grain. News from Tashkent received at Askhabad is exceed- ingly scanty. The Askhabad post office at present refuses to receive postal matter for Eussia. The sequence of events during the first half of February appears to have been that the Bolsheviks who were in strength at Kaghan disarmed small bodies of Cossacks passing through. Subsequently the Cossacks received an accession of force, consisting as far as it is possible to ascertain of the 1 st Siberian Cossacks, the 7th Orenburg Cossacks, and the 4th Orenburg Cossacks (the Wf.v. Wine pvftp.uated the Khivau Khanate), and certain independent sotnyas. The first considerable body of these on arrival at Kaghan seized the telegraph building and commenced hostilities with the Bolshevik troops. They were reinforced by later arrivals, and after negotiations with the Bolsheviks, recovered the' arms taken by the latter and proceeded on their wav by train eastwards. Just short of Samarkand the Bolsheviks had taken np the line near Juma station and were holding the break in some strength (accounts state they had 8,000 soldiers and 3,000 red guards). They appa rently opened fire at once and fighting occurred^ but was stopped by consent of the chiefs on both sides who again entered into negotiaiions, as a result of which the Cossacks were enabled to pass through Samarkand. Further fighting apparently occurred before Tashkent was reached which seems^ to have terminated iu the Bolsheviks favour: probably the Cossacks hearing of the state of affairs at Orenburg abandoned a combat which in point of numbers must have been most unequal. As neither posts nor passengers have been coming through from places east of Samarkand, and as the Bolshe viks control the telegraphs, the actual result can only be inferred from the fact of the railways having been reopened. The native community appears to have been in no way concerned in, or to have taken any part in these hostilities, although in the opinion of^ some the Bolsheviks mi'ght have taken action against the Kokand administration had not their hands been full with the Cossacks. There has been a general Russian exodus from Khiva. Early in the last month Samarkand bazar was partially looted by native robbers, neither the Russians nor the native guards being able to stop tbe marauders who entered the town by night. A report from Bokhara states that the Amir has enlisted some 12,000 sowars and 8,000 Infantry and that he continues to engage recruits for the latter. He has, however, allowed 9,0o0 of the sowars to disperse on condition of reassembling at once on notice being given them. A recent arrival who left Bokhara on the 23rd ultimo speaks of these sowars as still collected at Bokhara, and farther more states that the Amir had disarmed some Russian soldiers passing through from Kerki and Termez. It is possible that this is a later development, but from reports received previously such action seems unlikely.A number of Austrian prisoners are reported to have been sent to Tashkent from various Bokharan towns early in February, the rumour prevailing; that they were to be repatriated. Four field-guns from Gunbad-i-Kabus with their personnel passed Merv % for Samarkand on the 7th February. That the Bolsheviks were seriously alarmed by recent happenings their proposal to destroy railway bridges, and in particular the Charjui bridge, clearly 0.

The Karguzar stated that he was unable to hand them over to H. B. M. Consul- General without instructions to that effect from Tehran, but that he had telegra phed for orders as to their disposal. H. B. M. Minister has been informed, and the prisoners remain in Persian hand. It is understood that the 0. C. Cossack Division at Tehran approves of the arrangement noted in paragraph 64 for intercepting prisoners proceeding to Tehran via Bujnurd. 70. Quartering of troops .—I received a telegram yesterday from H. B. M. f Military Attache, Tehran, that the O. C. Persian Cossack Division had instruct ed the O. C. Brigade here to accede to our wishes with regard to the caravan- sarai and stables necessary to our troops. On approaching Colonel Meshetich on the subject he informed me that no such instructions had reached him, and that without them he was unable to act. As the O. C. Division stated that he had sent the order some six days before, their non-receipt here is strange to say the least of it. Apart from the hastening on of repairs of these premises which are in a very dilapidated condition, latrines and cooking-places must be constructed, and the time at our disposal is short. 71. Local affairs.—There have been rumours of impending trouble between the Democrats and the “ Grief-bearers ” during the week, but the Sardar Intisar appears to have prevailed on the latter to cease their importunities at the Tele graph Office. Some local unrest, however, still obtains. Mir Baqi Sultan with some of his savars is now at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. It is stated that some of the Zushki women who had received permission to visit their relations in confinement yesterday were searched and found to be in possession of Mauser pistols and implements for breaking out. The Rais*i* Qushun has apparently ordered the prisoners to be chained in consequence. . } Herat and Afghanistan. 72. Germans and adherents .—There has been more talk of the departure oi the Turko-Austrian party but nothing very definite. Both the Naib-ul- Hukumat and the Naib Salar would apparently be glad to be rid of Kazim Beg. It is probable that a chance of comparatively safe departure through Russia will be awaited. In the meantime the Austrians have somewhat reorganised their following which now consists of Abdul Wahab, Abbas Ali, Ahmad Barbari, Jamshid, Muham mad Arab, Agha Karim, Said Raza and Nauruz—the last-named a new name. They have parted with two Barbari saises Ghulam Nabi (Number 14 in list attach ed to Summary 6 of 1917) and Muhammad Hussain, who does not appear in that list as such, but who may be either Number 12 or 13. They appear to have 3 horses and 28 mules still in their possession. ^ The servant who accompanied Sidiq Beg to Kabul has returned with a report of this individual’s very favourable reception by the Amir who assigned him a regular monthly payment and proposed to utilise him as an instructor, presumab ly in the military art. To a reiterated request for assistance from the Urganj Turkoman Sardar the Naib-ul-Hukumat replied that as Afghanistan was on friendly terms with all nations definite help against the Russians could not be expected. The Sardarwas told that he was at liberty to depart but preferred to await a reply from Kabul. News of the Russian evacuation of Khiva has evidently not yet reached Herat. 73. Military After inspection of the Khaki battalion the Naib Salar promoted one sepoy to subadar, one to kot-havildar, and 10 to non-com missioned rank. The cavalry, under their Brigadier Shapur Khan, has been exercising in the neighbourhood of the Maulvi Jam hills. A Major of the 3rd Herat! Battalion has been flogged, fined, and dismissed the sevice for peculation. Repair of the Kandahar road and that to Rabat-i-Ghurian is being under taken under a sapper subadar detailed from Kabul. Russian Turkistan. 74. Current affairs. — For the greater part of the week there has been a practical cessation of communications from Turkistan, and neither post nor news papers have arrived from Askhabad this week. The cause appears to be a most strict censorship on the part of the Bolsheviks, and the Russians here are completely in the dark as to what is proceeding. Throughout the week there have been persistant rumours of disturbances and fighting at Askhabad, either between the Bolsheviks and Musalmans or the M usalmans or Armenians, but l can find no confirmation of these either by telegraphic conversations with Askhabad or by interrogation of the very few arrivals. It appears at any rate to be certain that much anarchy prevails there, robberies occurring in broad daylight, and in discriminate shooting at night. Early in the week I received cypher telegrams from Merv, one da f ed the 1st instant stating that troops had been sent from Askhabid towards Kokand, and the second dated the following day reporting fighting at that place. An arrival who left Samarkand on the a th ultimo states that the Bolsheviks had a day or so previously bombarded and taken Kokand. In this task thev were assisted by Austrian prisoners. There were said to have been some 3 000 victims among the Muhammadan population, much material damage had been caused, and the place had been thoroughly looted by both Bolsheviks and Austrians. A more recent arrival still states that he saw some 250 Musalman prisoners from Kokand, among whom were women and children, at Askhabad station on the 4th instant. He had conversed with one of the women who stated that upwards of 200 Mussalman girls were missing, and he heard that the Bolsheviks were committing great excesses at Kokand where they have a strong force at the railway station who are indiscriminately shooting dow n Muhammadans That there is exaggerations in these accounts is probable, but there appears to be little doubt that something of the kind has occurred. It has, indeed, been foreshadowed for some time, and it is probable that as soon as the Bolsheviks bad finished with the Cossacks they have turned their attention to the autonomists at Kokard. So far the Russians here appear to have no knowledge of these events, which may perhaps be attributed to the blocking of all channels of news by the Bolsheviks, So far not a line has been received here from the officers of the 1st Semi* rechia Regiment. It is rumoured, however, that some of the Cossacks disposed of their rifles and ammunition on their way through Persia, which considering the prevalence of robbers in N. Khorasan should have been easy, but w'hich is not calculated to assist their successors in thbfce parts in keeping order. The remainder surrendered their arms at Askhabad without resistance. Two of the senior officers are said to have been placed under arrest by the Bolsheviks till the disarmament was completed, Meshed ; E. A. F.

The efforts of the ffical officials to arrange the difficulty have met with no result. Probably it will subside with the appointment of another Governor-General, for which post the Kavam-us-Saltanah would apparently be a satisfactory selection. 4. Haji Husain Agha, who has been for so many months the cause of trouble and annoyance to this office and of disturbance and unrest throughout the prov ince, left Meshed for Tehran on the 19th instant, and has left his nephew in charge of his properties at Jam and elsewffiere. This youug man is quiet and harmless. 5. The Karasuran employed in the immediate neighbourhood of Meshed have struck, apparently in despair at having received no pay for so many months. 6. Persian affairs {general).—It is reported from Darajaiz that the Turkomans are assembling at several places on the frontier with the object of raiding the Persian side of the border : all the Russian troops having now been withdrawn. There are no Persian Government sowars at Darajaiz, and the Governor has only a small number of his own. Some anxiety is felt therefore. 7. A raid by outlaws on a village near Sarakhs is reported. Prompt action on the part of local sowars recovered some of the property carried off, but one villager was killed and another wounded. 8. Mir Yusuf of Khaf (paragraph 23 of Diary No. 6 and previous report) seems now to be quite a reformed character; this is no doubt due to the presence of British troops. In company with,a party of Karasuran, he engaged recently a gang of robbers near the Afghan frontier, killing two and bringing in four prisoners, two of whom are wounded and under treatment by the Indian medical officer attached to our small force. 9. The continued enmity between the Chief of Bujnurd and the Governor of Kuchan, to which reference has frequently been made in these Diaries, is the cause of much suffering to the people of Shirvan, not only on account of the raids from each party which take place from time to time, but also because they are obliged to provide supplies of fodder, etc., for the sowars, extra numbers of which are billeted upon them. 10. British affairs .—I have received a particularly cordial and friendly reply ! from the Naib-ul-HuJcumah of Herat to a letter which I had addressed to him protesting against certain restrictions which had, according to a report from M. Delcorde, been placed upon caravans carrying Indian goods. He promises to give the matter immediate attention, and to remove the causes of compla nt. 11. The value of the goods imported from India during the month of Jadi (23rd December to 20th January) is about 3J lakhs of rupees. The decrease is due to the fact that transport via the Herat route is more difficult to obtain in winter, and the difficulties of travelling are greater generally. 12. The arrival at Turbat-i-Haidari of 75 men of the 19th Panjab Infantrv with a medical officer and a telegraphist, the whole being under the command of Lieutenant Adams, is reported (paragraph 12 last week).13. I have received an intimation from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that the Officer Commanding the Persian Cossack Division is disposed to issue orders for the caravanserai which the Brigade here have occupied (paragraph 15 last week) to be handed over to us on the arrival of our troops at Meshed. This is satisfactory, but there is a party here, headed by M. de Beauvais and Colonel Scouratt, who are much displeased at the presence of British troops in what was formerly their sphere of influence, and they are working for the caravanserai to remain in the hands of the Cossack Brigade. 14. The Karguzar has again written protesting against our military occupa tion of Khorasan, and has been told that I have nothing to add to the reply already given to him. 15. Certain democrats have spread the report in Meshed that the disturbances referred to in paragraph 3 above have been organised by us in order to increase the necessity for the presence of a British force in Meshed city : considerable ingenuity is, in fact, shown in efforts to attribute to us every misfortune which occurs. Nevertheless, the large majority of the local community, both official and non-official, are friendly. 16. Russian affairs—News arrived last night (22nd) that the 1st Cossack Regiment had been disarmed by the Maximalists on arrival at Askabad from Meshed. This fact has special local interest on account of the question of the Persian rifles which the regiment had declined to surrender (paragraph 17 last week). Perhaps the Maximalists will now return them to the Persian authorities. I hear that the Cossacks sold a number of their rifles while at Kuchan en route for Askabad. 17. I have secret and reliable information that M. de Beauvais has reported to the Russian Minister in Tehran that M. Nicolsky has received a large sum of money from me on condition that he should wmrk in our interests. He is still trying to pursuade the Caucasians to take active measures against his chief, but they are more interested for the moment in the an^-democrat agitation, and he is not now likely to succeed. 18. At the same time the Caucasians have formed a committee with the object of transacting business direct with the Karguzari, and the latter, in reply to an enquiry from my colleague, have assured him that they have no intention of recognising the existence of this committee officially. 19. My colleague has received orders from Tehran to raise the fee for the countersignature of passports to Russia, but the Karguzari have objected and referred the question to Tehran for instructions. 20. Colonel Meshetich, Commandant of the local Persian Cossack Brigade, has returned from a short visit to Russia which was curtailed on account of his inability to proceed beyond Baku. 21. Persian and German intrigues. —Information has been received of the arrival at Bujnurd of a batch of escaped prisoners of war from Russia, fifteen in number, who say that many more will follow^ them. It is proposed to station a party of Persian Cossacks on the Tehran road at or near Sabzawar to intercept any who may be despatched to Tehran by the Chief of Bujnurd', who has applied to the Government for funds to defray the expenses of such refugees. I hope to visit Buj- nurd in person shortly with the object of making a suitable arrangement with the Chief to send the prisoners to Meshed. 22. The arrival of 15 refugees is also reported from Kelat. Further enquiries will be made. 23. The attention of the local democrats has been almost entirely confined to the agitation above referred to during the past week. They have telegraphed to their friends in Tehran, sending copies to the President of the Council and the Foreign Secretary, explaining that the wickedness of the parties who have now taken sanctuary in the telegraph office as a protest against themselves is solely responsible for the arrival of British troops in Khorasan, and suggesting that the Sirdar Intisar is not a fit person for the acting Governor-Generalship ; as his brother, the Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah, is a member of one of the societies concerned in the demonstration. They add that they do not wish to use force for the purpose of3 SsS” t“3 5ufL2r ploffi '' “‘ h * yh »'« * i “‘ »th u^iir'tkXSSrJ'S™ heldoa the fror/'Lltn^The' NailIT hT ° f ; Ta ™ uri .immigrants from Persia is reported assemLd^pany txtrct'from™ “ t0 al ° ud t0 an received from Lbu,. ‘ The fofe^ The Russians received the peTcrdekgates T/ Petrograd^it^eat ceremony, and ejected the sympathisers with the Allies from their dwellings m order to provide accommodation for the guests to P “aZ f ortli n r R 7 i tp haVe b T released ’ and tave returned increased thereby C ® tral Powers, whose strength has been greatly m Th »:„t', fh~rr.^,r2:„i: ,h ' , '•*• &lt;4 ’ T 1 “ ^ “* ^ *» %&gt;'« - ?g e isiircsr? “ ed from Russia, being opposed to the Maximalists and their dedre lor a separate peace.

Karim Beg visited the Naib SaUr on the 11th, and in the course of con versation remarked that France and Italy were about to follow the example of Russia and make peace with the Central Powers who, however, had refused to accept an offer of peace from the British, whom they were determined to annihilate The Naib replied that the annihilation of the British would not be such an easv t matter. • J 29 On the 12th Nasrullah made some statements in the bazar regarding the total destruction of London by German aeroplanes, etc., but his stories wem not taken seriously by his audience, who merely reminded him of the frequency with which such events had already taken place. 30 On the 13ththe .V aib-ul-Hukumah sent to Von Gruden a piece of substance resembling coal, which had been brought to him from a neighbouring hill. Von Gurden rode out to the spot, and returned with several specimens which he showed to the Naib, declaring them to be iron, copper, and gold. The Naib declined an olfer from him to make a thorough examination of the specimens, preferring to retain them himself. ° 31. In conversation with the Naib Zalar on the 12th instant, Von Gruden remarked that he wished to leave Herat for Persia. The Naib replied that he could not do that now as the British had troops watching the frontier. 32. Our Agent again remarks how difficult it is now for him to get information It appears that one of his servants who had gone to Chahar Bagh in search of news was seen there by the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who asked him his business, and on receiving no reply told him not to come again without some special object.

The Karguzar continues to make slow progress but has j-ie I 6 ur y ie to his work. Meanwhile his office is in disorder, and we find it difficult to get anything done. ’ ^kfhziadah Murtaza Mirza, the Town Governor, has resigned his post owing to the refusal of the acting Governor-General to sympathise openly with the democrats m regard to the parties who have taken sanctuary in the telegraph office (paragra,ph 3 last week), who have now announced their desire to secure the nomina- e Naiyir-vd-Dattlah as Governor-General and have assumed a more definitely awta-democrat position. 3. Persian affairs (local). —The Karguzar has received an anonymous com munication signed by the “ Bolsheviks of Meshed ” accusing him of complicity in the purchase of Government grain from the Revenue Department at 15 tumans per kharvar and its subsequent sale at 70. The waiters are supposed to be members of the Caucasian party in Meshed, who are much in evidence at present. 4. The Aghazadah and other prominent mujtahids of the city have received a telegram from the Jungli party at Resht (under the name of the Haiyat-i-Itihad-i- Islam) in wdiich Maximalist views are expressed and assistance sought, parti cularly in the direction of the removal of foreign interference in Persian internal affairs. The Sardar Intisar, however, has received a telegram from Tehran instruct ing him to arrest any Jungli found here and despatch him to Tehran. 5. Referring to paragraph 2 above, the Rais-ut-Tujjar, one of the leaders of the extreme democrat party in Meshed, called upon me two days ago and after some commonplace remarks asked whether I desired the return of the Naiyir-ud- Daulah as Governor-General. I asked him what his object was in putting the question. ^ He replied that he did not himself want the Naiyir, but that before taking active steps to prevent his return he wished to know how I regarded the question as he did not wish to oppose me. I said that all Governors-General were alike to me so long as they worked for the good of their people and behaved justly and fairly to all, but that I required of any person who desired to oppose the nomi nation of any particular candidate the adoption of orderly and constitutional methods, and that I would inevitably be the enemy of those who shewed their opposition by murderous attacks on the friends of the candidate in question. The Rais rephed to this by warmly expressing his detestation of such methods, but he was undoubtedly concerned in the attack upon the house of the Najd-us-Saltanah last November (see paragraph 1 of last year’s Diary No. 46) and understood the allusion. This attention on the part of the democrats is due to the approaching arrival of British troops, from the presence of which much is hoped for in the direction of reform. 6. The parties referred to above have not yet left the telegraph office and feeling in favour of the Naiyir-ud-Daulah is increasing in the town. No reply has been received to the representations made to Tehran, for which another Cabinet crisis seems to be responsible. 7. The Home Office have been informed by telegram that an officer and 50 men will be sent at once to guard the Sarakhs frontier (see paragraph 7 last week and previous reports). 8. The Zushki and Shikari robbers who, under the Chief Muhammad Zabiullah, had taken refuge in the village of Dizabad, have surrendered to the Sardar Intisar after an ineffectual attempt to obtain protection from us by sending in a messenger offering to surrender on certain conditions. They were informed in reply that the surrender must be to the local authorities and not to me, and the Sardar was informed of the incident. P ;v j / A 1 HI, . f/ if L 4 ' i : j cb H I The band are now imprisoned in the artillery barracks, and their case is under consideration. (In this connection s^e paragraph 6 of Diary No. 7.) 9. British affairs. —The detachment of the 19th Punjabis whose arrival at Turbat-i-Haidari was reported last week, are under orders to proceed to Meshed at once, but there is a difficulty in regard to transport and I have been compelled to send animals from here. In consequence of the delay which has occurred my visit to Bujnurd (paragraph 22 last week) has been put off for a few days. 10. Russian affairs. —Colonel Guschin, who remained behind in Meshed on the departure of his regiment, recently has asked for our good offices to seiure for him the command of the Persian Cossack Division in Tehran but this does not seem to be vacant at present. 11. Colonel Meshetich (paragraph 21 last week) has suggested more work for his Cossacks outside Meshed, and we have recommended to Tehran that they should take over charge of the Meshed-Bajgiran road and occupy certain posts on the Bujnurd-Tehran road for the interception of escaped prisoners passing that way. 12. M. de Beauvais is still working for a disturbance on the arrival of our troops, doing his best to stir up the Caucasians while outwardly most friendly. 13. Orders have been received from Tehran by my colleague that the arms removed by the Cossack Regiment on its departure which are the property of the Persian Government should be made over to the latter but as reported (paragraph 17 of Diary No. 7) this cannot now be done. The Karguzar has also been instructed to take them over. 14. On the 25th ultimo an attempt was made to attack the editor of the pro- democrat journal Bahar by a party of Caucasians, but the man was not in his office when the ruffians arrived and so escaped. My colleague was asked by the Karguzar to imprison the latter, but he replied that, according to law he was unable to do this and could only enquire into the case referring it subsequently to the Comfnittee at Askabad in the event of the persons concerned being found guilty. The Karguzar, whose courage now vis-a-vis M. Nicolsky is amusing, has declined to accept this reply, saying that the ruffians carry arms and must at least have their arms confiscated, if not by the Russian Consulate then by the local police. 15. A robbery in the Russian Consulate General took place on the night of the 26th ultimo. Nearly all the kitchen utensils and a considerable quantity of linen were removed. The Cossack escort are suspected, but there is also a possi bility that some of the household servants may have been concerned. 16. Persian and German intrigues. —The democrats of Darajaiz have tele graphed to their friends in Tehran urging that the Government should be pressed to recognise M. de Bravine as Russian Minister, as he will conduct business in Persia with new methods, opposed to those of the former Russian Government. 17. The democrats of Sabsawar have complained to Tehran of the despotic attitude of their Governor, Shahzadah Shuja-us-Sultan. The acting Governor General has been instructed to enquire into the causes of complaint. 18. A secret meeting of Meshed democrats was held on the evening of the 23rd ultimo. The only subject dealt with was the trouble with the party in the telegraph office referred to above, and various suggestions for self-protection were discussed. 19. At another meeting it was decided to send a messenger in the person of the leader Haji Muhammad Ja far Kashmiri to the Sardar Intisar to concert with him measures for the destruction of all British troops attempting to enter Meshed city. 1 he Sardar told the deputation that such things should not even be spoken of, and that nothing should be done in the way of opposition without previous sanction from Tehran. 20. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam .—The Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan have again threatened Mahmudabad, but withdrew on the approach of some of Saiyid Haidar s Barbari so tears. W e hope that the long pending question of the government of Jam may soon be arranged without waiting for the appoint ment of a Governor-General which we have been doing hitherto.SECRET. ^ INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY, NUMBER 6, FOR THE WEEK ENDING THE 9TH FEBRUARY 1918. auuut to ioiiow wnen a telegram from the delegates of the regiment at Askhabad was received stating that a force of frontier and Red Guards with machine guns was setting out for the Russian frontier to intercept and disarm the regiment near Gaudan. A meeting of the two remaining squadrons was immediately held at which it was decided not to leave Meshed. Any men who chose to leave their arms behind could go, and apparently half a dozen or so elected to do so. It is not known at present what the decision of the two squadrons already en route will be, nor can it be said with any certainty what the men here may finally elect to do. They are in the greatest confusion, and their state of mind may be gauged by the fact that three of them came to me after dark last night, and stating that they were like sheep on the mountains without a shepherd, asked if they could take service with us. At this point a communication from the Officer Commanding Regiment has just reached me to the effect that it has now been decided that the two squadrons remaining here should leave as soon as possible for Kuchan. They would mpve thence on Askhabad as a complete regiment. Probably developments will be watched before continuing the journey from Kuchan. It may be hoped that the decision now arrived at is final, as although the disadvantage of leaving Meshed for a time without troops cannot be disregarded, the conduct of the C ossa cks during the last week has been deplorable. They are neither under the control of their officers or committees, drunkenness has been all prevalent, and indiscriminate firing at night near their quarters a not infre quent occurrence. In their present condition they are not only useless in a military capacity but also constitute a public menace. Colonel Gustchin remains here ; the other officers accompany the regiment, no vacancies in General Baratoff’s force for officers being at the moment available. 37. Local affairs .—The outcome of the democrat meeting to consider the question of the arrival of British troops was apparently limited to the despatch of a telegram to their comrades at Tehran to protest against their despatch (paragraph 26). The intrigues 'among Russian subjects are being watched. So far no further developments have come to light, and it appears possible that nothing definite may result from them. The Postmaster is reported to be settling the question of the Meshed- Bajgiran post road, but communications with Transcaspia are at piesent bad, and only one post from Askhabad has been received this week. Com munication vid Sarakhs is delayed owing to the Russian postal service by cart having been removed between Tejen and Sarakhs. The post between these points is carried on camels, but these are occasionally seized and eaten by Turkoman marauders. 38. Suspect .—messengers noted in paragraph 33 is named Said Assad- ullah and generally known as Mir Taslim. He was apparently released after confinement in Sistan on suspicion, and proceeded to Afghanistan. He states that he was secretly brought before the Naib-ul-Hukumah at Herat who asked him if he had any message or letter for the Turko-German party at Herat, in which case he would be well treated. On his stating that he was the bearer of no message he was expelled from Afghanistan and subsequently arrested by the British Agent at Kariz.

Neither the source nor the nature of these has transpired. 40 The Naib Salar. -The Naib Salar who had on previous occasions animadverted on the injustice suffered by Afghanistan m the loss of Pamdeh, and expressed the hope that it would speedily once agam become an Afghan possession, caused considerable excitement among his officers at Darbar on the ogth ultimo bv publicly expressing his surprise at the non-receipt of a farmm instructing him to take measures to regain it On leaving the Darbar the Brigadiers and Colonels informed their subordinate officers that they should hold themselves in readiness for a move. The Colonel of the Artillery in parti cular enjoined complete readiness in all particulars on the captain of the maxim ind the captain of a mountain battery, stating that he would cause any person pretexting unpreparedness as a cause for delay to be shot. At a dinner attended by all officers on the 26th January the Naib Salar produced from his pocket a news sheet printed on very thm paper and read the fniinwincr ifpms nf intellisrence to the assembled company . ( a \ The British Government had instructed the Japanese to take oyer a lar^e quantity of ammunition in Siberia. The latter did not comply and the ammunition fell into the hands of the Germans. ( 6 ) The Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in France had repre* sented to his Government that^ without a reinforcement of a million men he must suffer inevitable defeat by the Germans. No such reinforcements were available. (c?) Serious damage was caused in Bomba y by bombardment by German • Zeppelins. The Naib-uI-Hukumah incidentally remarked that the present freedom of the Persian Press, who were now enabled to print timely and accurate news, was very gratifying. He inten ded to send news received from Persia for insertion in the Shir a) • al-Akhbar. 41. Frontier .—The Colonel of the Artillery informed the officer in charge of “ spare guns ” at Herat that he might expect orders to take the guns to the frontier. Captain Jalal-ud-Din of the Jadidi Kabuli Battalion has been ordered to proceed for duty at Dahnah-i-Zulfiqar. 42. Recruiting.—The Cavalry Brigadier reported on the 30th ultimo, to the Naib Salar that sufficient recruits for two squadrons of the new cava ry regiment had been raised. A major and two subordinates convicted of receiving bribes in ^ onnec ^ 1 n f with recruiting were publicly flogged and suspended head downwards ror an hour at the Ark. A fine was subsequently levied from them. 43. Orain collection .—The Naib-ul-Hukumah has issued stringent orders regarding the recovery of revenue grain and also as to parting with the 3 to any private individuals.jm, g- Sfcti* •Q ‘f.iS N W ?fc^: «c.

A 9 urren ^ eve nts .—Affairs are reported to be somewhat better at Ashkabad as a committee, comprising several Musulman members, is attending to local affairs. This appears to be the outcome of the decision to institute ouse-to-house searches for supplies to which the Musulman inhabitants were prepared to offer active resistance. A telegram from the Kokand committee has been received at Askhabad embodying instructions for the raising throughout the country of a militia force to grapple with the evils of robbery. This militia should be entertained and armed under local arrangements. a o neMS has yet reached here of the arrival of units of the 2nd Turkistan rmy Corps. A Siberian sotnya reached Askhabad and was disarmed by the 1 .r^ 8, 3 e 7 . th 0renbur g Regiment apparently left Askhabad unmo lested but nothing is known of its subsequent fate. Reports despatched from Bokhara on the 18th ultimo state that the Amir has now raised and armed 6,000 horse and 10,000 footmen. He is despatching 100 rifles each with ammunition to various centres with instructions to the local authorities to raise men themselves. The rifles are said to form part of those looted during recent Tashkent troubles, and according to his Treasury officer he still has about 8,000 on hand. These preparations are being made avowedly in view of the fear of a rising against the Amir by the Society of Union and Progress, but it is said that they are in reality directed to the declaration of his independence. He is said to be in communication with Rokandis and Samarkandis on this matter. The latter are also reported to be engaging and arming men secretly. The Mullahs and the Khushbegi are apparently not convinced of the soundness of these tactics, and certain officials stated to my informant that the Amir would make a costly mistake if he imagined that the Russian power was at an end and contemplated any. aggres sive action. The Union and Progress Society, some of whose members were recently found mysteriously killed by night, are alarmed and have sent a deputation to the Bolsheviks at Tashkend. A reinforcement of 1,500 Russian soldiers with maxims and guns is, subject to confirmation, reported to have reached Kaghan, and another 2,000 with magazine rifles and maxims, Samarkand. 45. German intrigues .—Reference to paragraph 24 Intelligence Summary No. 3 Having received no reply from the General Staff re the German officer, and mistrusting their ability under present circumstances to take effective action, the Military Agent despatched a trusted man to follow up the affair. The latter has reported receiving intelligence confirmatory of the ’ passage through Samarkand of a German officer accompanied by 4 Turks, and adds that an important part of the task of this individual was the organising j of German and Austrian prisoners of war. The agent was attempting to ascer- | tain the present whereabouts of the party. E. A. E. REDL, Lieut.•Colonel, General Staff Officer.SECRET. 9 1 1 i « Intelligence Summary No. 7 for the week ending the 16th February 1918. Khoeasan and Nokth-East Persia. 46. Russian force .—Cossatcks have been leaving as transport was available during the past week, and yesterday the last party left Meshed for Kuchan. Till, within the last year the Russians had been confiscating rifles carried by Persians unprovided with a pass from the Russian Consulate-General, and a considerable number were accumulated in this manner. In the course of the week representatives of the Persian Kargiizari and Police demanded the return of these arms. They stated their intention of placing a guard on the building in which they were kept, and in the event of non-compliance of taking them back by force. Colonel Gustchin intimated that his men would have orders to fire on the guard and threatened that in the event of any aggressive measures he would telegraph to his men at Kuchan to sack that place. The Persians thereupon abandoned their demands. 47. Local affairs .—Acting under democratic instigation the tullab or religious students have manifested some activity during the week. Commenc ing by the wrecking of the offices of the local paper “ Chaman/’ they have since taken up their abode at the Telegraph Office for the sake of ventilating their grievances to Tehran. Yesterday a large crowd of them was present, reinforced by Caucasians, members of the Union and Progress and of other societies, telegrams being despatched demandinsr the speedy appointment of a Governor-General, effective me asures for the safety of the town and neighbour hood, and requisite legislation with regard to food supplies. Sardar Intisar, the acting Governor-General, recently arrived at Meshed from the scene of his operations against the Zushki robbers. These appear to have been chased from the positions occupied by them to others, and some of them are said to have taken refuge in the town. They may be expected to return to their predatory avocations as soon as matters have blown over some what. The local Rdrasuran savars, charged with the keeping of security on roads in the vicinity of the town, have tendered a formal notice of resignation owing to the non-receipt of their pay and allowances. It is reported that the Aghazada, Hajji Hossain Agha, and other individuals whose activities have not conduced to the public weal, have been summoned to Tehran by the central authorities. Some of the poorest classes, in the straits for food, have more than once recently looted the stock at bakers shops. Sayyid Ahmad Beg Jemshadi’s raid on the Russo-Afghan border region appears to have given positive results as his followers have brought about 1,000 sheep to Zorabad. Sayyid Ahmad’s refusal to part with any portion of the spoil to Nasrullah Khan, the deputy governor of Zorabad, seems likely to lead to a split between the two worthies. Some dissensions have arisen between the Jaghuri section of the Barbaris under Sayyid Haidar, and the Dezangi section under Sayyid Murtaza which have resulted in the disarming of some individuals of one party and the interception of some supplies by adherents of the others. 48. Levy rfcrwi/^.---Recruiting for the Hazara levy corps which began on the 5th instant has yielded somewhat upwards of 30 recruits up to date. These men will be despatched to Kain on the 18th instant together with a party of Hazara recruits for the regular army. Smaller batches will be sent down as expeditiously as possible in future on the arrival of a conducting party now on their way to Meshed. S2519gsb : M&gt; 49. Quartering of troops —It was understood between ourselves and the Commandant of the Prussian, troops that we should take over such portion of the accommodation vacated by them as was necessary for our purposes. The area selected is the main road leading to the Ark Gate. Ibis admits of concen tration, proximity to the Consulate-General and the only drinking water supply, and assures command of the main exit from the city in this quarter. It is also the most likely to promote good sanitary conditions. A large caravansarai nearest to the gate with ample stabling accommodation (the latter the property of the Persian Government) opposite had been selected as the quarters for our cavalry squadron. The Russian Consulate-General had a long lease of this 1 caravansarai for the purpose of quartering their troops there- This, before the departure of the Russian troops, without any communication being made tons, they ceded to the Persian Cossack Brigade who placed a guard on the premises while the Russian Cossacks were still in actual occupation. It is to be hoped that we shall be able to secure this caravansarai as without it any satisfactory arrangement for our troops will he impossible. A part from any other consi deration it is highly undesirable that our men should be quartered in direct | proximity to the Persian Cossacks who include many men of indifferent f character and intemperate habits. The actual caravansarai occupied by the Persian Cossacks, which lies in another quarter of the town, is in many respects superior, although too distant to be of any use to us. Their object in moving is to be in proximity to their Com- mandanPs quarters which lie outside the Ark Gate. As, however, they had no .idea of moving so long as the Russian troops remained here the necessity for this step cannot be classed as very urgent. 50. Prisoners ,—Mir Taslim and the deserter Achir will be despatched to Birjand on the 18th instant in charge of a party of Hazara recruits. Herat and Afghanistan. 51. Germans and adherents .—The Austrian Gruden has sent for sets of horse shoes apparently as a preparation for starting. He conducted Ahmad Barbari to the Naib-ul-Hukumah who interviewed the man. On the 3rd instant an Austrian or German was brought into Herat from the frontier who was subsequently taken by Gruden to the Naib-ul- Hukumah, and who, from the account of the interview appears to be a German who had settled at Samarkand and claims to have embraced Islam. Prom its vernacular presentment his name might be Adler. He is quartered in the Baghi-Kartak with the Austrians. Abbas Ali, the former head of Wagner’s stable, who accompanied the German party on departure from Herat, and according to the prisoners state ments, remained behind sick near Khaf, has returned to Herat. He claims to have met Wagner at Tehran and to have brought messages from him, among them being orders to the Austrians to await instructions before setting out till Nau Ruz (23rd March). He also handed letters, purporting to be from Wagner, to the Naib-ul-Hukumah and the Naib Salar. The Austrians are now provided with a useful selection of Persian followers acquainted with a variety of routes. I Mohendro Partap was reported to have been quietly living at Mazar-i- ShariFup to three weeks ago. As access to him is jealously guarded it was not possible to ascertain how he is employing his time. It may be supposed, however, that he is no stranger to the intrigues in progress in Russian territory. 52. Herat troops .—A farman has been received from the Muin-as-Sultanah calling for the urgent submission of a report as to the number of officers deficient in the Herat garrison in order that names may be submitted to the Amir for appointment. Two trained signallers each have been attached to infantry companies and artillery batteries, on the establishment of which they will be borne. Signal ling instructions in common will, however, be continued.Men of advanced years siill doing duty with Herat troops have been warned to produce recruits in their stead before Nan Ruz. On orders from the Naib Salar the mullahs attached to military units have commenced a series of lectures to the men on the advantages of pilgrimage and in particular of stating that any man refusing to engage in the latter when required to by his sovereign ^ is no better than an infidal. The Kakuri mullah^ though interdicted by the Naib ul-Hukumah from lecturing in public is frequented by the soldiers. Russian Ttjrkistan. 53. Current Communications with Turkistan are for the moment at their worst and letters are taking ten days or more to arrive from Askhabad. The 28th ultimo is the latest newspaper which has reached me. The 2nd Turkistan Army Corps have apparently not arrived in any strength, and the Russians themselves here have no knowdedge of such arrival. Report state that about 1,000 men each have reached Askhabad, Merv and Charjui from Baku. 2,000 soldiers, apparently Siberians from Baku, passed through Merv near the end of January. Ihey were unarmed and it was reported that their arms had been taken over by Caucasians. 1 he independent Semirechia sotnya from the front was stopped by maximalists apparently to the east of Kaghan and ordered to surrender their arms. The men refused, and after dis arming the maximalists, proceeded on their journey. The track was, however, taken up in front of them and they left the train to proceed to Samarkand by march route. Nothing further has been heard of them. A serious fight with casualties on both sides apparently broke out at Samarkand early in the current month between Musulmans and Armenians, and according to reports received was still in progress on the 8th instant. The origin appears to have been the enlistment of Turkistan Armenians for service against the Turks. The Bolsheviks attempted to appease the Musulmans who were receiving reinforcements from various places but without success. They were afraid to intervene actively. Five heavy guns were despatched from Kushk through Merv at the end of January, it was there stated for use by the Bolsheviks against Butov’s Cossacks at Orenburg. Other reports shew, however, that they have been utilised at Kaghan where the Bolsheviks have concentrated in some strength. Bokhara is a hoBbed of intrigue. The Amir’s military preparations ostensibly against adherents of the Union and Progress Society are generally held to be in reality directed against the Russians, and he is reported to be receiving encouragement from the Caucasus inspired by the Turks. At the same time a definite plot against him engineered by the Union and Progress in conjunction with the Bolsheviks is said to exist and to count many supporters from outside—notably Turkomans—as well as Persians, Afghans, and other foreigners domiciled in Bokharan territory. The proposed moius operandi out lined is that a disturbance initiated by malcontents within Bokhara should bo “ suppressed ” by Bolshevik forces from Kaghan who would utilise the occasion to arrest the Amir, the Khushbegi, and the Kazi Kalan and band them over to the Society of Union and Progress for disposal. Apart from this the Bolsheviks have required the Amir to dismiss the ahovementioned ministers, and according to the latest, report to hand the Kazi Kalan and his son have been despatched to Charjui under arrest. There is also friction between the Amir and the Bolsheviks on the question of supplies. Traffic on the Central Asian railway was stopped on the 5th and 6th instant from Kaghan in both directions the cause being stated as trouble between Cossacks and Bolsheviks. Reports from Sarakhs indicate complete anarchy on the Russian side, which is reflected in the Persian border regions. Small parties of soldiers comeand co from Saraths and Pul-i-Khatun, bnt the BussiaM hare apparently abandoned most if not all of the frontier-guard posts in that reg.on. Both murder and looting in the neighbourhood are common. Bread has been refused to Persians at Russian Barakhs and they have been told to obtain their supply from Persian Sarakhs. Addendum to ' Khorasan and North-East Persia'. 54 . Austrian prisoners.—Th* paymaster of the 1 st Semirechia Regiment by order of the Commandant yesterday handed me a sum of £21 sterling in gold and 51 tomans, being the money taken from the Austrian prisoners by the Russian patrol which took them over at Said-ud-Din. This sum has been TT rrman 1 ate-General for disposal. Meshed ; 16th February 1918. 1 E. A. E. REDL, Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staff Officer. S2519GSB -40-2-4-18-GCBP Simla—— SECRET. Intelligence Summary No. 8 for the week ending the 23rd the week for Askhabad which they reached on the 21st instant. They were disarmed at the railway station soon after their arrival by the Bolsheviks, and offered no resistance to this proceeding. It is not known for certain at the moment whether a very small detach ment still remains at Astrabad or whether that region has been completely denuded of Russian troops. 66 . Local affairs .—The telegraph office has continued in use during the week by applicants to Tehran, but a certain portion of the local democrats have intimated to the former that they should cease their importunities. Hajji Hussain Agha duly left for Tehran. On the night of his departure several hundreds of rifles were transferred from his house to a place of safety— it is rumoured to the house of the Rais-ut-Tujjar. Munshi-i-Nizam has returned to Meshed. A Zushki robber who had taken refuge in the Shrine has been surrendered to the local authorities. The breach between Savyid Ahmed Beg Jamshadi and Nasrullah Khan Zorabadi seems to be widening. The latter has arrested 4 Jamshadis for a camel robbery, and is reported to have informed the Afghan Captain Com manding the post at Dalma-i-Zulfiqar that he will be on the look out for an excuse to arrest Sayyid Ahmad Beg and to hand him over for despatch to 11 erat. The differences between the two sections of Barbaris appear to have been composed. An epidemic disease is rumoured to have made its appearance in Pain Jam. 67. Austrian prisoners .—A report that 15 Austrian prisoners, escaping from Transcaspia, had reached Bujnurd, and that, according to their statement, a larger number was to be expected is confirmed by a communication from a reliable source that recently such prisoners have been using the route Garmab- Ak-Robat-Bujnurd, obviously with the object of reaching Tehran. Occasionally they pass out by Daragiz. Latterly little has been heard of such gentry and it is possible that the withdrawal of the 2nd Semirechia Regiment from Astrabad and cordon eastward has given them their opportunity. The best steps to take under the circumstances are beieg considered. It has been noted before that since the revolution and particularly since t the rise of the Bolsheviks the prisoners enjoy complete freedom of movement, ; and that there are no obstacles from the Russian side to their escape whenever they consider such action worth while. At no time apparently had the Russian authorities anything more than the most approximate idea of the numbers of prisoners in the country, and latterly the Commandant of Askabad informed the Russian Military Agent that he had not the slightest idea of the number of prisoners in the town. The men are scattered about the country earning their living as they can in any employment for w r hich they are fitted. Although the prisoners in Transcaspia cannot, by all accounts, number more than a few hundred, there is apparently nothing to prevent an influx from Turkistan given sufficient inducement. 68 . Persian Cossack Brigade .—Colonel Meshetioh has returned from Russia having been unable to proceed beyond Baku owing to the condition of the railways. He appeared quite ready to meet our wishes as regards the quartering of our troops, but signs are not wanting that he has now been approached by those desirous of thwarting our wishes in that respect. It may be hoped, however, that the matter will be satisfactorily arranged. 'CV Febrnary 1918. Khobasan and North-East Persia. 65. Russian force .—The 1st Semireohia Regiment left Kuchan during s2540gsbHe fell in with brigands at Imam Kuli ami at another point between that place and Knchan, but on bis sending a message stating bis identity they did not molest him. He is exceedingly anxious to obtain permission to hold the Askhabad-Bajgiran road winch is completely unprotected since the Cossacks* departure and on which the posting of our troops is not contemplated. Ho ^ would also, if permission were granted, take measures to intercept Austrian prisoners making their way to Tehran from Bujnurd, and both he and his officers keenly feel the inaction to which the attitude of the Persian Govern ment to the Khorasan Brigade condemns them. 59. Germans and adherents .—On Gruden reiterating his intention of leaving via Persia it was pointed out to him that Khaf and Kain were now occupied by British troops, and it is probable that he will await the result of enquiries. Our Agent continues to report difficulty in carrying out his work owing to close supervision, for which it is most probable that Kazim Beg is responsible. 60. Military affairs.—'Ihz Haib Salar is reported to have received Kfarm^n from Kabul enjoining on him the completion of his cadres with all despatch. It was added that when his complement was at tained, the Afghan militarv forces would total 120,000 effectives. 61. Mazar-i-Sharif .—A belated report from Mazar, dated at the end of August, states that magazine rifles with 50 rounds apiece had been issued to all infantry battalions there. 100 khavanin savors had been recently engaged. A second letter, dated November contained no information of interest. 62. Current events .—Exceedingly contradictory reports, due in ereit measure to the cessation for several days of telegraph and railway communica tions from Tashkent, have been received during the week. Arrivals who had left Bokhara on the 14th instant and arrived here on the 20th stare that train loads of soldiers passed eastward through Kaghan towards Samarkand and Tashkent where fighting between Bolsheviks and Cossacks was reported to be in progress, and on the 12th instant a report was current at Ashkabad that the Cossacks bad seized both Tashkent and Orenburg. A telegraphic conversation yesterday with Askhabad did not confirm these reports Railway and tele graphic communication had been restored, and the principal NationafCommissary Kolessov from Tashkent had reached Ashkabad. Not only was the 1st Semi- rechia Regiment disarmed, but also 2 squadrons of thb Turkoman Cavalry Regiment, just back from the front, suffered the same fate. They were pie- pared to resist, hut on the Bolsheviks bringing up cannon against them they realised that active resistance was futile. The conflict between the Armenians and Musulmans at Samarkand is re ported to have ended with 30 casualties on the side of the former who are said to have been expelled to Tashkent. Bold robberies are rife at Tashkent and all over the country, the Bolshe viks being unable to maintain any sort of order A large band of brigands w ? 8 .* ^ owever » attacked and dispersed with considerable loss near Kokand by militia apparently raised by the Musulman community. The issue of bread was entirely stopped at Askhabad for some days, rice and kishmish being substituted. Some flour has sinee been received. Samarkand recently proposed to withhold goods for Bokhara and also to cut off the irrigation water from the Zarafshan if the Amir continued to pro hibit the export of flour to Samarkand. Snow has fallen in the Samarkand region in sufficient quantity to impede railway traffic, and there has been some rain in Transcaspia. Herat and Afghanistan. Russian Turkistan. Meshed ; 23rd February 1918. E. A. F. REDL, Zieutenant-Colonel, Q.S.O. S2540GSB - 40- 3-4-1S-GCBP SimlaMeshed Diary No. 7, for the weekending the 16th February 1918.

The editor then took sanctuary m the house of Haji Hussain Agha, who caused in^tT ° g T m the ^azadah whereupon the students who had taken refuge m the telegraph office returned to their homes. g The matter has not ended there, however. Representatives of the various an^-democrat societies have occupied the telegraph office during the week, and telegrams have been sent to Tehran urging the necessity of a successor to the feamsam (paragraph 2 above) being appointed at once. On the 15th an address was delivered by a prominent ex-democrat to a multitude assembled in the telegraph office m which the speaker explained that he had been deceived by the democrats and induced to oppose the nomination of the Naiyir-ud-Daulah as Governor-General and that he now advocated his appointment. 4 A new Society under the presidency of the ex-democrat above mentioned to be known as the ‘ Ranjbaran ” or “ Trouble-bearers,” has been formed. Their objects seem to be much the same as those of the Union and Progress Society with whom they are working. 5. A bread-riot of a mild type occurred on the 12th, which was easily checked by the police. It is now generally realised that the democrats are responsible for the price of bread continuing to be unnecessarily high, and feeling against them is increasing generally on this account. There have recently been further desertions from their ranks. 6. Persian affairs (general).—Hhe number of Shikari and Zushki robbers sent in (paragraph 5 last week) has increased to 11. The main gang under the chief Zabi-ullah have escaped to Dizabad, a village inhabited by Ismaili (or Agha Khani) proteges of ours, where they are said to be entrenching. The Ismailis are unfortunately powerless to object or resist. 7. With the object of compelling the Persian authorities to send an expedition to punish the Barbari Chief Saiyid Haidar, Haji Husain Agha recently induced Saiyid Murtaza, one of the smaller Barbari notables, to plunder some of the villages of Saiyid Haidar’s people. The latter, whose conduct is satisfactory now that^he knows that he can count upon our support, has referred to me for instructions, and the intrigue has failed. Haji Husain Agha has been summoned to Tehran and leaves in a day or two. He is understood to have admitted recently that matters are not going well for him here. 8. The Governor of Turshiz, now Shahzadah Mustafa Mirza, has arrested some of the murderers of Sultan-ul-Ulama (paragraph 12 of Diary No. 4) and has telegraphed suggesting their punishment in Turshiz, apparently with a view to local effect. itf m,i y, a ® May9. The capture of one Ghulam Husain, the chief of one of the robber bands which have recently been active on the Chinaran road, with some of his men, is reported from Chinaran. 10. A robbery with murder is reported to have occurred in the house of one Mirza Muhammad Husain at Khaf. The criminals are believed to be Baluchis. They are being pursued by the local Karasuran. 11 British affairs .—The local democrats are preparing a manifesto declaring that the dearness in the price of bread and provisions in the province of Khorassan is due to the entry of British troops. They are endeavouring to cause a number of seals to be affixed to the document, and intend to submit it to the Persian Gov ernment. 12. The arrival of 70 Indian infantry with guns and two British officers at Khaf is reported, en route to Turbat-i-Haidari. 13. Khan Sahib Allah Din, Superintendent of this office, is appointed tempo rarily as Agent at Turbat-i-Haidari, and Mania Bakhsh is returning to Meshed to act as Superintendent. 14. The Bev. D. M. and Mrs. Donaldson left Meshed on the 12th instant en route to the United States of America via India, etc. Drs. Esselstyn and Hoffman are now the only members of the American Presbyterian Mission remaining in Meshed. 15. During the past week we have been engaged in taking over caravanserais, etc., for the accommodation of our troops. It had been decided to arrange for the Indian cavalry to occupy the caravanserai which was on the point of being vacated by the Bussian Cossacks, as it was understood by the Commandant of the corps and ourselves that we should take over such of his premises as we might require. To our consternation, however, it was found that the caravanserai m question had already been passed on by the Bussian Consulate General to the officers of the Persian Cossack Brigade, and we have not yet succeeded in inducing the latter to relinquish their claim. The caravanserai has immediately facing it the best cavalry stables in Meshed, and as I have obtained a promise from the Acting Governor-General that we should have the first claim upon these, it is most likely that the caravanseari, which is of little use without the stables, will eventually be made over to us. 16. Russian affairs .—The whole of the Cossack Begiment—with the sole exception of the Commandant, Colonel Guschin — have quitted Meshed, the last party having left yesterday. Their prospects are uncertain, but it is understood that they will not return here. 17. A curious incident occurred on the 11th instant in connection with the departure of one of the parties of the regiment The police and the Karguzari became aware that one or more of the boxes of arms and ammunition which were that day being brought out for despatch contained the various rifles which have from time to time been confiscated by the Cossacks from Persian subjects. They accordingly each sent a deputation to M. Nicolsky, urging that these weapons were the property of the Persian Government, and as such should not be carried away but delivered to them. My colleague was inclined to agree with this view, but the Cossack officers declined to surrender the arms, and eventually it was decided that they should carry them off and the matter be referred to Tehran. 18. Before ihe regiment left some Cossacks requested Haji Husain Agha to take them into his service, but on the advice of my colleague he declined to accep their offer and they left with the rest. 19 . Nothing more has been heard of the intrigue mentioned in paragraph h last week, but it is said that the. Caucasian party are still much dissatisfied m M. Nicolsky, and intend to replace him by a nominee of their own as soon as tr y have the power. 20. Misbehaviour on the part of Cossacks in Kuchan is already mported, an^ the towns-people will be fortunate if they escape with small damage a, ttie n of the regiment, which will all congregate there within a few days.$ I ■ if * 21of SOme esca P ed Austrian prisoners at Barajaiz is reported, and ir is saia tnat tire Governor gave tliem some money for expenses and then sent them away. Enquiries will be made. 22. Persian and German intriques.—As stated above the affairs of the local emocra s ave not advanced during the week. The usual meetings were held, and some cm^-British suggestions were made in connection with our desire to arrest escaped enemy prisoners m Khorassan : it was urged that any such arrests should be opposed by force if necessary. c J lscusslo u_in regard to our troops followed (paragraph 19 last week). Nothing has been received from Tehran yet on this subject, and the only new proposa 1 was that Shaukat-ul-Mulk might be asked why he has never raised objection to the presence of British troops in Sistan. ‘ J A letter from a messenger who had been sent from Meshed to Herat to open amo ^ ^ Persians domiciled there was read at the second meeting, at J ^ ma tter of the Chaman described above was discussed, and the murder oi the editor again suggested. Finally a letter from Tehran saying that a certain number ot rifles at tumans 11 and mauser pistols at tumans 23 are available for anv one who wishes to buy, was laid before the meeting. J 23. News from Karmz.- The Baluch Chief, Salar Khan, has arrived in Karaiz on a visit to the Governor of Bakharz, Shuja-ul-Mu^k. oo i 0l } r Agent hears that Indian sowars accompanied by Mir Yusuf (paragraph 23 last week! have reached Karat on the Afghan frontier in search of Austrians who were supposed to have left Herat for Persia, and that they returned to Khaf finding that there was no truth m the report which had reached them. 25. News from Herat. —Eight families of Turkoman immigrants from Russian territory have been sent in to Herat by the Governor of Gulran. The Naib-ul- Hukumah has ordered them to be sent to Kandahar after Nau Roz, tt ^ om P^ a ^ n I s against the Governor of Maimanah having been made to H. M. the Amir, he has referred them to the Naib-id-Hukumah of Herat, directing the complainants, certain immigrants from Transcaspia, to wait upon him. a • Governor of Chakhansur reports to the Naib-ul-Hukumah that one baiyid k.hah, revenue officer at Chakhansur, has embezzled four lakhs of rupees and fled to Persian territory. The Naib has ordered the imprisonment of the man’s brothers who are in Herat and the confiscation of their property. 28. On the 2nd instant the Naib-ul-Hukumah summoned von Gruden to him with the escaped prisoner Ahmad Barbari (paragraph 27 last week). It is not known what passed at the interview. On the same day von Gruden asked his mihmandar to provide him with spare shoes for five horses and five mules. 29. On the 3rd, Kazim Beg paid a secret visit to the Naib Polar, which lasted for about an hour. That evening an Austrian who knows no Persian (probably an escaped prisoner) was brought from the frontier and sent in to Bagh-i-Kartah. ' 30. von Gruden gave strict orders to the mihmandar on the 4th that none of the guard was ever to enter his room ; and he also gave him to understand that he could do with a smaller number of servants, apparently with the same object that of increased secrecy. 31. On the 5th von Gruden visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah at his request in company with the new arrival. He told the Naib that this man was a Greman who with certain relatives had come to Samarkand several years ago, where he had been converted to Islam. The Naib who does not seem to have believed this stroy, allowed the refugee to return to Bagh-i-Kartah. 32. On the Cth instant Abbas Ali, one of the men who had accompanied Wagner on his recent journey to Persia, returned to Herat. His story is that Wagner sent him back from Tehran, and that on the return journey he stayed for 20 days in Meshed without being detected : but that he was then recognised by a Herati there and had toi.leave. The Austrian prisoners told us that this man had remained in Khaf indisposed, but this story is quite likely to be the true one. On4 ti e following day Abbas Ali is said to have delivered two letters to the Afghan officials from 'Wagner. It appears from this that Wagner's destination was, after all, Tehran, as I suspected. 33. Our Agent still remarks upon the attentions of the Naib Solar towards him, and thinks that Kazim Beg is intriguing (paragraph 29 last week). 34. Our Agent heard on the 8th that a firman had been received by the Naib- id-Hukumah from the Amir regarding Saiyid 8hah (paragraph 27 above) instructing him to take proceedings against the man’s brothers (which had already been done). The firman stated that the absconding revenue official had had intimate relations with the British authorities in Sistan, and that the latter are now keeping him there having received him with great honour notwithstanding his conduct!

Khorasan and North=East ^Persia. 25. Russian Jorce. The Semirechia voisko has reiterated the order for the 1st Regiment to proceed regardless of transport facilities. The routine application of the Officer Commanding Regiment to the Officer in charge of Military transport in Turkistan for trains to transport his regiment from As.vhabad on the first days of Russian Rebrnary has elicited the reply that the facilities will be forthcoming. This, however, denotes nothing as the assent is nr a purely formal nature, the responsibility resting on the officer making the application. The Cossack delegates sent to arrange at Tashkent for the passage ot the regiment are due to arrive at Askhabad to-day. Some days must there' foie elapse before they can reach Tashkent and communicate the result of their efforts. In the meantime a recent development is likely to have an impoitant beaiing^ on the situation. The 2nd Semirechia Regiment left Astrabad for Semirechia with the consent of the Maximalist authorities. During the week a rumour was current that they had been stopped en route. Yesterday Colonel Gostchin received a telegram from the General Officer Com', manding, Cossack Division, Samarkand, stating that the 2nd Regiment had been disarmed by the Bolsheviks between Charjui and Samarkand. They had then been hastily passed through Samarkand, their actual destination being unknown, and no report whatsoever of the occurrence had been vouchsafed to the General Officer Commanding Division who could thus only telegraph the bare fact of the disarmament. A telegram has also been received from the small detachment of the 1st Regiment acting as escort to the Russian Resident of Bokhara at Kaghan that they hare been disarmed. Under these circums tances it is unlikely that the Yoisko will insist on the departure of the 1st Regiment to share a similar fate, or that, in the event of such an order being given, the Officer Commanding, 1st Regiment, will comply with it with a knowledge of the almost certain consequences of such compliance. (2) The motor car of the young officers noted last week is reported to have arrived at Nishapur in a damaged condition and the officers to have continued their journey to Tehran either by carriage or on horseback. 26. Local affairs .—After the usual indecisive operations which characterise a Persian force operating against robbers, the Zushkis are reported to have broken out and to have taken refuge among the hills of the Hazar Masjid range. If this is true there will be little chance of bringing them to hook. A few fine days have, in conjunction with the profiteers, again caused a rise in the price of bread. A democrat, selected for his phenomenal integrity to regulate these matters, is now under suspicion of having made some tens of thousands of tomans by complicity with dealers and other interested persons, and has been informed that his further connection with the matter will involve risk to his life. Democrats are exercised at the prospect of the coming of British troops to Khorasan, and recently discussed suitable steps to be taken to prevent this wffiile there is still time. (2) A significant sign of the times was the closing of all shops on the 24th instant as a sign of mourning for the bombardment of the Shrine by Russian troops in 1912, the day selected being the lunar anniversary. This is the first occasion on which the Persians have ventured to mark this day of unfortunate memory. It is now proposed to hold this observance annually. Herat and Afghanistan. 27. German and adherents .—Kazim Beg and Barakatullah recently ! visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah and Naib Salar, retailing their version of the pan- Islamic developments at Meshed, in the Caucasus, and in Turkistan. They o U I 8' • X 1 were at pains to demonstrate its anti-British character. As invariably happens 1 0 n such occasion their followers subsequently disseminated exaggerated versions in the city. To this they added the sure news of the recapture of Baghdad and the capture of Egypt by the Turks, as well as the intelligence that all English in India had been annihilated by a sudden rising of the population. The latter item had, they stated, been received “ by telegram.” Kazim Beg in retailing imaginary Turkish successes to his escort is reported to have proposed to them the assassination of the British Agent. He is reported to employ 2 Turkomans to bring him secret intelligence of affairs in Russian Turkistan. 28. Herat troops .—The names of the newly arrived officers and their appointments are given as follows :— Brigadier Shapur Khan to command the Cavalry Brigade. Colonel Abdul Rauf Khan to command the Gaznichi Battalion. Colonel Abdul Rasul Khan to command the 3rd Herati Battalion. Colonel Sayyid Rasul Khan to command the Jadidi Kabuli Battalion. I Colonel Zulfiqar Khan to command the Turki Cavalry Regiment. Colonel Muhammad Azim Khan to command the 3rd Cavalry Regiment now being raised. The arrival of a 6th colonel is expected for posting to the 9th Herati Battalion. (2) The Naib-ul-Hukumah, the Naib Salar, and senior military officers were invited on the 11th instant to the Shrine of Gazargah by its Mir. In congra tulating the garrison on its improvement in the military art the Mir remarked that in the event of jihad the troops would be a match for any possible adversary. In this view the Naib Salar concurred. (3) Owing to scarcity and the fact that a grain and forage allowance is issued to persons in military service, there is an improvement in voluntary recruiting. 10 recruits came forward for the cavalry in one week. Russian Turkistan. 29. Current events .—Little has come to hand this week regarding the Kokand autonomists. Apart from them the maximalists appear to be strengthening their hold for the time being, the Cossack element being too weak numerically to cause them much anxiety. Their cause is still further prejudiced by the suppression of the 2nd Semirechia Regiment. The Maxima lists have now taken the paper “ Askhabad ” into their hands, making a clean sweep of editor and former staff on the ground of the provocative nature of the publication Reports, though somewhat more detailed, are of much the same nature as those received last week. The Amir of Bokhara is said to have been unwill ing to countenance any resistance to the Bolsheviks, but to have been prevailed upon by the Khush Begi and the Kazi Kalan to give his support in the event of hostilities. He is said to be collecting men and horses as well as arms. Inhabitants of Tashkent, Eerghana, and Bokhara are thus said to be at one; according to some the Samarkandis are in sympathy with the Bolsheviks, but the probability of this seems doubtful. Members of the Bokharan Union and Progress Society are also said to adhere to the Bolsheviks, and to keep them informed of the course of events in Bokhara. It is generally stated that the Amir of Afghanistan has been approached by native elements but that he has hitherto vouchsafed no answer. Merv Turkomans were demonstrating and electing representatives at the end of last month. They were in communica tion with Caucasians at Merv. Inter alia there w r as talk among them of the Russians having ceded Turkistan to the British, in which statement the hand of the Turkish emissary might be predicated. Such emissaries are freely reported to be present but concrete instances are rare. One such individualSECRET. 8 intelliqence summary, number s, for the WEEK ENDING THE 2ND FEBRUARY 1918. Khorasan and North-East Persia. 80. Russian force.~-An unexpected development has occurred during the week, owing to which the immediate departure of the 1st Semireehia Eesfment has been decided upom The first echelon leaves Meshed, according to pS arrangements on the 5th or 6th instant, other echelons following at Tort intervals. The Offic,^ Commanding has issued orders for the immediate evacuation of Turbat-i-Haidari. xxnmtaiaie The delegates of the regiment on reaching Askhabad found that an inde- pendent Semirechia sotmja from the western front had arrived there „ ri ,i the arrival of the 7th Orenburg Cossacks from General bSov’s force and 1 another Orenburg regiment from Russia was expected. They therefore tele graphed to their comrades here to leave at once and to join these units on their homeward journey. A meeting of the regiment was held at which the Cossacks declared that they intended to leave at once to “ defend Semirechia ” Ihe Officer Commanding pointed out that as matters stood such a course meant inevitable disarmament as m the case of the 2nd regiment. If they wished to defend their country this could best be done by concerted action with other Cossack units expected to reach Turkistan. Although there might be some delay in reaching their homes this course would ensure the safety of their district. The men replied that they wished to return home at once No argument would avail to turn them and if the Bolsheviks wished to disarm them they were at liberty to do so. They despatched a telegram that evening to Askhabad announcing their speedy arrival. The Officer Commanding informed them that m such an event he refused to proceed with them and although they did not announce it at the time practically all the officers’ were of a similar opinion. It was at first thought that the men might seek to do violence to their officers, but feelings now appear to have cooled and it is to be hoped that the departure will take place without trouble. On further consi deration the majority of the officers, most of whom are married and whose homes are in Semireekia^ have agreed to proceed, but the commandant will remain here, and about six of the junior officers have asked us privately if they can be provided with service^ North-West Persia is indicated—through the good offices of the British. ° Some details of the modus operandi with regard to the 2nd regiment have been received. The Bolsheviks removed a portion of the track near Kaghan and on the arrival of the train containing the 1st echelon, machine-guns and some hundreds of “ red guards ” were found in position. These intimated that unless the Cossacks at once handed over their arms fire would be opened on the train. The Cossacks complied and subsequent trains were dealt vith in the same manner, rifles and all ammunition and lances being taken, but swords being left to the men. The Commandant had before departure exacted an oath from ail ranks that in case of a Bolshevik attempt at disarmament the Cossacks should resist to the last. He himself refused to surrender, and declared his intention of proceeding by march route, seizing the regimental standard and calling on all faithful to their oath to follow him. Six men did so, but before they had gone far the remainder went after them and brought all back. The men appear to have passed through Tashkent presumably *en route for Semirechia. It is not clear what has been done with the officers. 31. Local affairs. —The post from Sarakhs was looted last week and a recent post to Askhabad robbed a few miles from Meshed, the perpetrators of the latter being Russian subjects who drove out from the city and awaited the post waggon. The post contractor of the Meshed-Bajgiran line has thrown up his contract and is removing his horses on the road, the alleged cause being loss on working expenses ; another and more probable explanation is impressive conditions introduced by the Postmaster in conjunction with theubiquitous Hajji Hussain Agba. Some Zushki prisoners have been sent in by the Kais-i-Qushun, some being genuine robbers but other villagers sent m to swell the total of captures. Some Zushkis are said to have been arrested in the town on the premises of Hajji Hussain Agha, but confirmation is for the moment lacking. Mir Baqi Sultan is, or was recently, at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam with 40 savars. Taimuris hare raided 100 sheep at Amghun, and two men have been found killed on roads in that district. Sayyid Ahmad Beg Jamshadi is reported at Zorabad. He has sent some of his men to bring in what animals they can loot in Russian territory. Nasrullah Khan Zorabadi has presented him with some 30 kharwars of grain for present necessities. Intrigues are afoot among the Russian subjects against their Consul- General. °There is little doubt that the 1st Secretary, assisted by Mir Murtaza, is at the'head of this movement, or that the first-named gentleman is attempting to stir up feeling in the city against the occupation of the cordon abandoned by the Russians by British troops. 32. Deserter. An Indian giving his name as Achir of Bula Khan in the Karachi district has surrendered himself here. He states that he was employed as a khalasi on a river dredger Sandpiper (?) commanded by one Mr. Jeffries or Jeffrey, and that he deserted in consequence of a gambling quarrel when working between Basrah and Kurnah. Herat and Afghanistan. 33. Germans and adherents.— Rerat reports further talk of the departure of Kazim Beg and the 2 Austrians, who are, however, quarrelling freely among themselves. He further states that on the 25th ultimo the 2 Aus trians had procured a guide of the Nurzai tribe named Hajji Yakub and that they had informed the Naib-ul-Hukumah of their intention to leave Herat for Persia. No indication of the route to be followed is given. A messenger, bringing a letter to the German party, was ejected from Afghanistan by the orders of the Naib-ul-Hukumah. The man was arrested at Kariz and sent in to Meshed, but has hitherto made no clear statement. 31. Herat troops.—The* Naib Salar inspected the men of the “ 2nd Artil lery ” and expressed himself satisfied with their proficiency. Owing to a captain of the Jadidi Kabuli infantry striking a a mistake during drill, the subadar, aided by another, attacked ■ % subadar for the captain with his sword but was disarmed before harm was done. Both subadars have been dismissed the service by the Naib Salar and sent to Kabul for punish ment. (2) The Naib Salar is reported to have said in a recent conversation that Panjdeh had been wrested from the Afghans by the Russians by force and injustice, but that the day was near at hand when Panjdeh would be retaken by the Afghans. Russian Turkistan. 35. Current events .—Much oppression appears to be exercised by the Bolsheviks at Tashkent, where anarchy obtains. Prequent firing at night occurs, and on the night of the Russian New l~ear a regular fusillade occurred on the streets, attributed to various causes—nervousness of Siberian soldiers of an attack by natives, or enthusiasm of the newly armed local “ red guards ’ being among them. Several unfortunates were killed and more wounded. Somewhat similar conditions have spread to Askabad where the respectable inhabitants live in terror. Executions by the Bolsheviks without any proper trial are reported. The “Position of war” was, however, countermanded in Turkistan on the 21st ultimo and in Transcaspia on the following day. House to house searches for pro visions, were proposed at Askhabad on the lines of those carried out at Tashkent. This measure is an excuse for robberies of all sorts and can have no practicalX result. Supply conditions are going from bad to worse. The “Askhabad” reports that the daily bread ration at Tashkent has been reduced to J‘lb., and it is proposed to reduce that at Askhabad to ^ lb. Famine exists at Tejen and deaths from hunger are reported from Samarkand. Bokhara is in straits for food, particularly in the country districts which the inhabitants are leaving for the towns ^ According to the “ Askhabad ” there is considerable emigration to Afghanistan. Owing to dry weather little sowing has been done and there is little hope of unirrigated land producing a grain crop in Bokhara. About one-ninth of the normal area is said to be under cultivation. A large number of the Siberian troops in garrison have already left, and the remainder are reported to be under orders for departure. The 2nd Turkistan Army Corps from the Caucasian front is expected to return to its normal peace stations in Transcaspia, the date of probable arrival given being the 28 th ultimo but information has not yet been received of the actual arrival. Barracks at Merv were recently being cleaned up and put in order for the reception of the troops. In addition, as already noted, Cossack units are returning from Russia. Much depends on the attitude these troops will adopt. The Bolsheviks are apparently in ignorance of it and are nervous of conflict with possible anti-maximalist units. If organisation and the will to do it f were present among arriving Cossacks and soldiers the overthrow of the Bol sheviks would probably not be difficult. The Kokand autonomists recently proposed that the Workmens and Soldiers Committees should resign their authority throughout the country in favour of themselves and a representative of the Bolsheviks from Tashkent was sent to Kokand to discuss the matter. No conclusion was arrived at, but at the same time musulman committees in provincial towns are increasing their influence. At Samarkand they summarily executed convicted robbers, and at Merv Turkoman guards have taken over supervision of the railway and premises, the prison and other institutions. Affairs there are directed by a committee of 4 Turkomans, 3 other Musul- mans, and 2 Russians. The following are some of the proposed conditions read in a Merv mosque soon after the declaration of independence. {a) Railways and telegraphs to remain in Russian hands for 5 years, subsequently lapsing to the native population. (b) Military forces to be raised from natives of Turkistan. Russia * would have no right to call on them for service elsewhere. No Russian troops should serve in Turkistan. (c?) Customs and passport dues on Persian and Afghan frontiers should appertain to natives of Turkistan. Russia should have no share or right in these. (d) A Russian Consul should be appointed for Turkistan. Russian justices of the peace were dismissed at the Russian New Year but they have been asked by the natives to continue their functions until the Kokand Committee can arrange for their replacement, their salaries being defrayed by the native community. The Turkoman savai's raised at Merv are between 500 and 1,000 in strength (according to various estimates). Only a portion were armed until recently but arrangements were being made to draw Berdan rifles from the military store to arm the remainder. Tartar soldiers are giving instruction in drill. The Tejen Turkomans have raised 100 savars on their own respon sibility. Although the native population appears to have generally adopted the principle of Musulman autonomy, Turkomans and inhabitants of Transcaspia have expressed their preference lor being affiliated to the Caucasus rather than to the Kokand organisation. It is therefore at present proposed that the Amu Darya should form the dividing line, those to the east of the river falling under the authority and management of the Kokand committee and those to the west taking their orders from the Caucasus. According to reports received from Turkistan itself and the statements of arrivals from that country considerable efforts are being made to raise anarmed force of the natives of each district for self-protection. As before indica ted the same course is being followed in Bokhara, and on a recent occasion when a quarrel arose between Sunni and Shiah savars, the Amir himself acted as mediator and pointed out that no differences should exist between followers of Islam. The possibility of a rising against the Bolsheviks Ls frequently men tioned by natives, and an officer at Askhabad discussed this possibility a few days ago in the course of a telegraphic conversation with the Officer Command ing Russian troops here. Want of organisation and of definite leaders would appear to be causes likely to defer the inception of such a movement. Meshed; E. A. E. REDn/, Lieut.“Colonel, General Staff Officer.

(1) It is said that several hundred students recently collected for ghaza in Zamindawar and talked of marching against Meshed ! They were dispersed by the local authorities. (2) Four “ German ” sowars have passed through Farah on the way from Kabul to Herat. (3) Much dissatisfaction is felt among the pastoral tribes of Garmsel, Nauzad Washir and Zamindawar on account of the rigorous recruiting. The people claim that only land-owning tribes are liable to supply men for the army, though all are willing to take part in a religious war. F. B.

(1) More than one report has been received to the effect that five “ Germans ” wearing Afghan dress are in Farah with the new Brigadier Muhammad Sarwar Khan. (2) Reports from Southern Khorassan indicate that three “ Germans,’’ or one German agent and two Kami guides, are reconnoitring a road for the Herat party into Persia. (3) It is rumoured in Chakhansur that a considerable number of Germans have already reached Herat from Merv. This report presumably is founded on the anticipations of the future. News from Afghanistan. (1) News has reached Birjand that the two Hazara sepoys who deserted at Sahlabad in 1916 (see Diary No. 12 of 1916) and who were sentenced to imprison ment by the Afghan authorities and to have their rifles confiscated, have recently been released in Herat. (2) The new Brigadier of Farah and Chakhansur, Muhammad Sarwar Khan, is acting as Governor of Farah. The ex-Governor Haji Abdur Rahman Khan (see Diary No. 2) has been placed under arrest pending the arrival of his successor, and numerous claims for refund of bribes are being filed against him. (3) Kabir Khan Gurg, the notorious robber of Dasht-i-Margo, has recently been looting camels, in one case the property of some Brahuis and in another of Ishakzais of Girishk. The Afghan authorities have issued strenuous orders for his capture, threatening condign punishment upon any official who may let him escape into Persia. (4) Mith reference to the entry in Khorassan Consulate-General Diary No. 49 of 1917, mentioning that 30 families of Sabzawaris have received permission to return home from Sistan, I have endeavoured to trace these people both in Sistan and Kainat and have entirely failed to do so, Some 50 families of coolies from Lash Juwain were in Sistan for about six months and left three months ago, but they were not political absconders.

Several reporters have lately mentioned the presence of the two mendicants o*' Turkish agents, first referred to m my Diary No. 2 of 1918. These persons have appeared at Tahgaz Regan and Girishk and are now said to have gone on to Kandahar. Their descriptions seem to tally with those of two Turks, who according to a recent telegram from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, were in Kermanshah about the beginning of January ; but the dates do not fit in satisfactorily. (2) It is said that a “ German ” has reached Rudbar from Kabul. and Hauzdar ruins, guided by a man from Chahar Burjak. They returned to Kala-b Kang along the Helmand. (2) A high officer named Abdul Aziz Khan Durrani has reached Kala Fath with an escort. He is inspecting villages and assessing the land revenues. (3) A Ghilzai caravan of 43 camels with loads from Quetta is said to have been raided by 20 Baluchis at Amiran, 24 miles from Chakhansur. Two of the Ghilzais were killed, four were captured and tied up; the leader Samad Khan and another man escaped. (4) Muhammad Umar Khan of Kala Fath—see Diary No. 52 of 1917 is now imprisoned at Kala-i-Kang. (5) It is said that contingents of Khawanin sowars have been summoned to Kabul from all directions for service on the Turkestan border. Meetings have been convened both at Birjand and Sistan for the election of “ Vakils ” for the new Parliament. I have not heard the names of the candidates in Birjand. In Sistan the people are inclined to vote for : (1) Haji Shaikh Reza, the chief Mujtehid, (2) Haji Muhammad Hussain of Tehran, brother of (1), and (3) Haji Mir Saiyid Ali, another Mujtehid of Sistan. It is reported from Birjand that botUShaukat-uI-Mulk and Hisam-ud-Daulah are in communication with the democrats of Tehran and Meshed, and are promis ing their assistance in the foundation of local branches, each hoping to win the Personnel.

An escort of 100 sowars with a military band has accompanied him. (2) See Diary No. 47 of 1917. Shah Nazar Khan, the Baluch fugitive in Khwaja Ahmed, has returned to Afghan Sistan, having come to a settlement with his fellow tribesmen, whose 153 camels he had carried off. The Governor of Chakhansur, who would^like to punish him, has asked for orders from Kabul on the subject. (3) A new Serishtadar, named Mirza Ghulam Ali, has reached Deh Aga Jan (the Governor of Chakhansur’s residence) to take the place of Saiyid Kazim, who is still in Mian Kangi (Persian Sistan)—see Diary No. 47 of 1917. (4) It is said that the new Brigadier has offered to advance money to Kadkhudas and others up to 18,000 Kabuli rupees (36,000 krans) for the purchase of rifles for recruits who are about to be enlisted! (5) Two breech-loading guns and a number of magazine rifles are reported to be on the way to Kala Kang from Farah. (6) It is said that Bahadur Khan, nephew of Haji Abdur Rahman Khan (late Governor of Farah), has been appointed Deputy Governor of Anardarra. Democrats' activities. Both factions in Birjand, led by (a) Abdul Husain Khan, a Mirza in the employ of Hisam-ud-Dauleh, and (6) the Principal of the Shaukatiyeh school have been holding meetings on most nights of the week. It is said that Hisam-ud-Dauleh has disclaimed sympathy with his Mirza’s actions. A prominent member of faction (a) named Afrasiab Azad, a Christian convert, has been accused of sendinganonymous threatening notices to Misbah Diwan, Haji Malik-ut-Tujjar, the Rais-i-Maliyeh, and the Rais-i-Nazmieh. He has been consequently arrested under the Governor’s orders. The Finance Department, Sistan. ^ The newspaper Kaukab-i-Iran of January 26th, 1918, prints a long letter of protest sent by the Kadkhudas and Mullas of Sistan against the appointment of Ebtihaj-us-Sultan. The letter is said to have been also sent to the Naubahar and the Iran. The signatories include the 5 leading Sardars, 5 Mujtehids and chief Mulla and the 16 principal Kadkhudas. Arms traffic in Sistan. See Diary No. 47 of 1917. Mullah Muhammad Husain of Taghazi has returned from Yazd and Kerman. He is said to have brought a quantity of copper-ware from the latter place. I hear that he is returning to the same parts with water melon seeds for sale. Insecurity in Sistan. The shop of a British Indian trader, named Abdullah Khan, in Deh Dost Muhammad, Mian Kangi, on the Afghan border, was attacked and looted on the 10th instant by a gang of about 30 robbers. The sufferer and the local Persian authorities declare that the raid was committed by Afghan sarbazes, whose tracks are said to lead straight back to Kala Kang. Similar robberies have been numerous during the past few months in the same locality. The property stolen is valued at 9,000 krans. F. B.

Persian officials. —The condition of the K 'rguzar (paragraph 1 last week) is said to be slowly improving. The Government commission (paragraph 1 of Diary No. 52) has been dissolved, and Sirdar Intisar, the Rais-i-Kushun, has been appointed acting Governor-General pend ng the arrival of the Samsam- us-Saltanah. The Intisar b ing at present out of the town his brother the Ma’tamid- ul-Wizarah, assistant in the Revenue office, has been instructed to carry on the current duties until his return. 2. Persian affairs (local).-—K&amp;ji Hussain Agha has written me an impertinent letter stating that as there is no Government now in Khorassan it is everyone’s duty to look after his own interest, and that as nothing has been done to compel Saiyid Haidar (paragraph 2 last week) to desist from raiding he is obliged to take measures himself. These measures consist in setting up another section of the Darbaris against Saiyid Haidar and continuing to work for the despatch of troops from Meshed to destroy the latter. Saiyid Haidar is at present occupied under my instructions in recovering property raided by his people wdth the object of returning it to the owners. This does not suit Haji Hussain Agha, for obvious reasons. -7 3. The Rais-i-Kushun is still engaged in dealing with the Zushki and Shikari robbers. He is said to have surrounded them but is unable to attack pending the arrival of ammunition, of which he is in need, and reinforcements. Letters have been intercepted which shew that Muhammad Zabi-ullah, the rebel leader, is in communication with Haji Hussain Agha, who is trying to obtain ammunition for him. I am still working for this man’s removal from Meshed, but it is no easy matter as he is both rich and influential besides being a Russian protege. Nothing can induce him to keep quiet. The robber chief mentioned in paragraph 3 last week has been shot on a charge of having attempted to escape from prison. 4. A new local party calling themselves “ those desirous of order in Khorassan,” and composed mainly of members of the Union and Progress society and deserters from the ranks of the democrats, have spent the last two days in the telegraph [office, where they succeeded yesterday in obtaining a renewal from the Samsam-us-Saltanah of the promises already made by the Persian Government regarding (1), the speedy departure of the Samsam from Tehran, (2), the reorganisation of the city and provincial police arrangements, (3), the establishment of a municipality in Meshed. 5. The Karguzari has received a secret telegram from the Foreign Office stating that recent reports from Askabad shew that the Russians have completely lost control over the Turkomans, who may now at any time create disturbances on the frontiers. All frontier governors are warned to be watchful, and it is promised that steps will be taken by the Government. 6. Persian affairs (general). —The question of Shirwan appears to have been settled in favour of Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan, to whose district it is again to be annexed. The Chief of Bujnard seems to be prepared to accept this provided that his jurisdiction is extended by the inclusion of Sar Wilayat or Astarabad. But Malik-ush-Shu’ra, the democrat leader, telegraphs to the Chief encouraging him to hold out for Shirwan. 7. Disturbances are reported from Turshiz which the young Governor Shah- zadah Amir Akram, son of Kamran Mirza, has found quite impossible to keep in, order. He has abruptly quitted his post, leaving no one in charge, and is believed to have returned to Tehran.8. Snow and rain dave fallen in great quantities tlirought the province, and rejoicing is general. The price of bread has slightly fallen, but there is much dis tress in Meshed city, and the members of the American Presbyterian Mission have found that their work of charity has very largely increased, no less than 1,400 people being now fed daily on their premises. Nothing serious in this direction is being done by the Persian authorities—-some of whom have subscribed to the Mission relief funds, however. 9. British affairs.— value of imports from India during the month of Kaus (23rd November to 22nd December) amounted to about four and a half lakhs of rupees at the usual rate. The apparent decrease is due to the congestion of traffic on the Karaiz route mentioned in paragraph 11 of Diary No. 51. N. B. —There is an error in paragraph 7 of Diary No. 52. The value of the goods which had arrived by the Sistan route should be 2| lakhs : the majority having arrived via Karaiz. The amended amount, however, shews that the Sistan route is becoming more popular, and the railway to Mirjawa will have its effect. 10. The arrival of 20 Indian sowars and a British officer is reported from Khaf, dated the 14th instant. 11. Russian affairs. — The question of the Cossack regiment is not yet settled (paragraph 13 last week), contradictory orders from various authorities having been received. It is now believed that the men may take matters into their own hands and elect to return to Russia, which they now wish to do. A letter from one of the young officers mentioned in paragraph 14 last week having been intercepted by the men of the regiment a meeting was held and it was decided to turn the writer and four other officers out forthwith. The five left for Tehran by motor car this morning. The letter to which exception was taken stated that the writer did not intend to return to Russia. 12. My colleague has had further trouble with his Caucasus subjects who recently sent a party of representatives to him to protest against the delay which habitually occurred in the settlement of their claims. They are said to be getting more and more out of hand. 13. Robbery and murder on the part of three Russian Cossacks is reported from the Khelat frontier. The details are not yet to hand. 14. A meeting of the Russian Caucasus Mussalmans was held during the week f with the object of promoting the union of Shias and Sunnis, and long speeches upon the subject were delivered. TTwas stated that similar meetings had been held at Baku and elsewhere, and that messengers- had been sent to Turkestan, Daghistan, and Afghanistan, urging the unity of Islam, and a hope was expressed that the Caucasus Government may be extended to include Tashkent and Daghistan. 15. Persian and German intrigues. —I have visited certain democrats during the week and we are now friendly with both the parties referred to last week, who have asked me to support their requests to Tehran regarding the reorganisation of the police, etc., which I am doing. It is significant that my assistance has not been invoked in regard to the appointment of Major Lemberg, and this seems to have been dropped. At the weekly meeting a letter from the Tehran Central Democrat Committee was read on the subject of the prospects of democracy. It was stated that their principles were gaining ground in most of the countries of Europe, and especial reference was made to promises, both open and secret, which are alleged to have been made to Persia by the Germans and Turks. The writers warn their friends against the British, who alone are accused of a desire to interfere in the internal affairs of Persia, and reflections are cast upon certain brethren who are accussed of hav ing become too friendly with the British Legation in Tehran. It is hoped that no such thing will happen at Meshed. It was also stated that a special committee had been formed in Tehran with the knowledge of the German and Turkish local representatives, and that messengers from this committee will be despatched to various towns and provinces$ to make enqumes into the influence and conduct of the Russians and British in the mnerent places. The democrats of Meshed have turned out from the society Hail l lussam Agha s creature Prince Saham-ul-Mulk and one Mirza Mustafa, whom they c onsi er responsible for the mistaken line which was taken in regard to the nomination of the INaiyir-ud-Daulah as Governor-General. 16 News from Karaiz. —The Russian doctor informed our Agent that he had received orders to close the free dispensary to the public, and treat only persons vHo couid pay. He complained of not'having received his own salary, and added t hat he intended to leave Karaiz shortly. 17. The Agent of Agliazadah (paragraph 2 of Diary No. 52), who is still at Kararz, has again requested Shuja-ul-Mulk to accept the Government of Jam, but he will not. * ’ 'i-nrl \ ^ ws f rom The Governor of Ghor has arrested three robbers of note and sent them m to the Naib-ul-Hukurmh, by whom the leader has been confined ‘ 111 a wooden ca ge, apparently with the intention of starving or beating him to death. ™ B ? g and Maulvi Barkat - ull ah paid a secret visit to the Naib Salar on the 6th instant. • I 1 subsequently transpired that the conversation was on the subject of a force t'w! the fin a h nd Urks 1 P?P ose t0 send t0 attack India via Afghanistan, and , ev s of the A mb were asked as to whether the Amir would be likely to allow P n S w° Ugh Afgl } an temtor 7- Tlle Naib thought that His Majesty would not be likely to grant this concession.

The servants of the German party have spread the usual false stories during the week under report, announcing the approaching arrival of German troops m kustan m route to invade India, which was already being attacked by sea • and the probability that Germany, helped by the Turks, would soon become ruler of the remaining nations. W? 11 Gruden stated on the 9th instant that he intended to remain in Herat until the disturbances now taking place in the interior of Russia had ceased : that he would then go ma Russia to Germany and hand over the papers left in his charee by Yv aguer, and. tlieiice proceed to bis own country. . Tr 23 \ T b e Preacher mentioned in paragraph 26 of Diary No. 51 has returned v 5 era u afte L- a tour m the neighbouring villages, and has resumed his preaching i the city. He accepts no presents, and this makes our Agent think that he is not indiependent but is on some special mission. It seems likely that he is connected witii the movement mentioned in paragraph 14 above. Meshed : The 19th January 1918. W. G.

The letter stated that the Hamadan Mullas and notables had requested the insurgents known as “ Junghs ” to take revenge on behalf of the Hamadams when Russian soldiers come in their direction. , 9 - HusaiI l Agha recently arranged the release of one Haii Muitaba who had been imprisoned for complicity m the disturbances at Khaf last summer (paragraph 11 of Diary No 33), and arranged to send him to attack Saiyid Haidar at Jam, having instructed him first to collect Mir Yusuf and his gang of ruffians from Khaf. Mujtaba, however, fell m with a party of Persian soivars on the way who wished to arrest him and shot him dead when he attempted to escape. ^ !0. The party mentioned m paragraph 4 last week quitted the telegraph officeon receipt of the Governor-General s promise to fulfil their requests, but have informed him that unless they see within ten days that his undertaking is to be carried out they will take stronger steps to obtain the leforms necessary. JK Persian affairs {general ).—The Rais-i-Kushun, who is still in the neigh bourhood of Zushk dealing with the robbers of that district, has telegraphed to the Governor-General and the Home Office saying that his operations are meeting with success and that he hopes to return to Meshed within a few days. He has made some captures, and some other robbers have surrendered, but the majority have escaped for the moment, and the Rais is at present waiting for accurate news of their position in order to make a fresh attack. ■llfl i Ilf 1 r 12. A curious story comes from Tursliiz (paragraph 7 last week). It seems that one Sultan-ul-Ulama was murdered by some persons unknown and his house plundered, and that Amir Akram the Governor instructed Aziz-ullah Khan, one of his lieutenants, to enquire into the matter. The crime was traced to Zahih Khan, the head of the local Karasuran, but unfortunately the evidence revealed the fact that the Governor himself was also an accomplice and he was obliged to fly to Zabih Khan’s stronghold at Sa’d-ud-din village, to attack which Aziz-ullah Khan is now making preparations. 13. British affairs.—The arrival of troops of Indian cavalry at Khaf and Buhnabad, one at each place, is reported. I have received an official communication from the Karguzari protesting against their arrival and asking for their immediate withdrawal. This is described as merely a formal matter, but the Governor- General’s office have telegraphed to Tehran for instructions. 14. Russian affairs. —The question of the departure of the Cossack regiment is not yet decided, but we hear that their companions of the 2nd regiment have been disarmed by the Maximalists, which may have some effect upon the desire of these men to leave Meshed. It appears that the five officers mentioned last week were obliged to hire a carriage at Nishapur for the journey to Tehran, on account of their automobile having broken down. 15. On account of various reports which had reached me I was obliged to ask my colleague on the 23rd instant whether he had complete confidence in his First Secretary, M. de Beauvais. He replied by a long account of how this mm had intrigued against him for more than a year. Recently M. de Beauvais’ attitude has become pro-Maximalist, and he has stated more than once his conviction that the troubles which have come upon his country during 'the past three and a half years have been caused by us. He has moreover attempted to stir up the local democrats and others to protest against the arrival of British troops in Khorassan, and worse than all has represented to the editor of the Behar democrat news paper that the various acts of cruelty and high-handedness which have been committed in Persia by his countrymen at different times have been suggested by the British. My colleague and I have telegraphed to Tehran asking for his transfer as soon as possible. 16. The withdrawal of Russian troops from the Sarakhs frontier is reported, and some anxiety is expressed regarding the possibility of raids by Turkomans. The Governor of Russian Sarakhs has written inviting the Governor of Persian Sarakhs to replace the Russians by reliable Persian sowars. 17. There has been some interesting conversation during the past week in the meetings of the Caucasian Turks. It seems that the Muslim members of the newly formed Caucasian and Turkestan Governments intend eventually to eject the Russian members, and to form a combined Muslim State. They have, accord ing to information given privately to us by the leader of the Caucasus party in Meshed, already sent deputations to the Sultan of Turkey and the Amir of Afghan istan asking for recognition of their aims and tacit approval of their plans, ihe leader referred to assures as that there is nothing British in this movement, and that the Turco-Caucasians are ready to fight with the Sultan of Turkey or any other Muslim potentate who opposes their desire for independence separate from the Russian) Government whatever form that might eventually take. 18. Persian and German intrigues.—The democrats decided at their secret meeting held early in the w^eek that the opportunity to show their zeal on 0 Government was now at hand, and that Shaikh Ahmad, the editor of the ^ should be sent as their representative to interview the Rdis-i-Kushun at /us j (paragraph 11 above) with the object of inducing him to accept a party of arme democrats to assist him in his operations. Shaikh Ahmad made the journey aecoi ingly, but it is not known what reply he received from the Rais. While returning he fell in with M. de Beau vis (paragraph 15 above), who took the 0 PPP r ^. umL ^ a ^ enlighten him as to his views, mentioning among other details his conviction the British we:e responsible for the suffering caused to Persia by the Russians..WW—P—Willi I j&gt;[WW&gt;»y,T7,lJ.ll.» a The result of this interview was another article in the Behar reflecting unfavourably upon ourselves. 19. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —The Russian Vice-Consul received a tele gram from his Minister at Tehran directing him to summon his subjects and enquire from them whether or no they accepted the Maximalist Government. They all declined to do so. 20. It is said that the withdrawal of Russian troops from Persia is due to German influence, and the Germans are in favour in consequence. 21. News from Turbat-i-Jam. —The Ilbaigi Kaudani is still at Jamrud. Mir Bald Sultan is at Turbat. From accounts received each is fleecing the people of his neighbourhood, and a Governor is sorely required. 22. News from Karaiz. —Shuja-ul-Mulk is engaged in the collection of 500 sowars, for the entertainment and payment of which sanction has at length been accorded by the Persian Government. 23. News from Herat. —Kazim Beg and the Maulvi Barkat-ullah visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 12th instant. He informed them that a committee had been formed by the Caucasian Turks in Meshed with the express object of working for the union of Muslims and especially the promotion of an alliance between Persia, Turkey, and Afghanistan ; and that they also desired to make Caucasia independent of the Russian Government. Kazim replied that the Meshed committee referred to also contained some Usmani Turks (this is not the case) who were working for the ejection of the British from Meshed, adding that they had already turned out part of the Russian community. The Maulvi stated that there was also a movement among Indian Muslims to separate themselves from British rule. 24. Nasrulla h on the day following this interview spread a rumour in the town ■ that a rebellion in India on a large scale had actually, taken place, and upon an objection being raised that letters which had recently arrived made no mention of such a thing replied that the information had been received by telegraph. 25. Kazim Beg now employs permanently two Turkomans who periodically bring him news from across the Russian border. 26. On the 15th Kazim called together the men of his guard, and after recount- ino - to them various imaginary Turkish victories invited a volunteer to kill the British Agent, offering rewards and promotion which he promised to obtain through the Naib Solar. The sepoys made no reply, but their Commander remarked that they were not allowed to undertake work of that kind without the permission of their Commandant. This Kazim said he would arrange. 27. Kazim Beg paid a secret visit to the Naib Solar on the 17th. It is not known what passed, but the Agent thinks that the object may have been connected with a plot against his life. 28. The arrival at Chihil Dukhturan of seven Europeans is reported. Orders have been issued to send them to Herat. It is not known yet whether they are Germans or Russians : our Agent promises a further report concerning them and their business next week. Meshed: W. G.

Amir Akram (paragraph 12, last week) has arrived at Turbat-i-Haidari and is ordered by his father Kamran Mirza to come to Meshed where he will receive another post on the arrival of the Samsam-us-Saltanah. 5 Persian affairs ( W).—Notice has been received by the Governor-General’s office from Tehran that His Majesty the Shah has directed the issue of orders in connect.on with the election of the National Assembly, and that the necessary documents will shortly be despatched. The office is to make the preliminary arrangements at once. r y 6 The Chief of Police has again begged me to ask that his budget as submitted to Tehran may receive sanction. I have approached Mr. Kornelis, who has tele- graphed to Tehran asking for the matter to be expedited. Some increase in the pay ot the police is really necessary at this time of scarcity. 7. On the 30th ultimo a post carriage which had just left the city en route tor Askabad was lobbed outside the Bala Khiaban Gate by a party of Caucasian Turks. Prompt act.on by the police recovered the stolen parcels but the thieves escaped with a sum of money. 8. Some excitement was caused in the town early in the week by a report that our troops had bombarded the Najaf shrine. An official denia 1 having fortu nately been received from Tehran the rumour was contradicted without delay and composure restored. J 9. Shahzadah Murtaza Mirza, the town Governor, has despatched a long telegram to the Samsam complaining of the state of the town and, in particular of the number of fresh societies which have recently been formed and in which he sees a danger to the public peace. 10. Persian affairs (general).—The proposal of the Governor of Russian Sarakhs that Persian sowars should be employed to guard the frontier in place of the troops recently removed is supported by the local Government who have telegraphed to Tehran recommending the entertainment of 60 men for the purpose (paragraph 16, last week). 11. Reports from Chinaran announce the arrest of ten Zushki robbers. The majority of their party has taken refuge in the hills behind Zuskh, and a force has been despatched to deal with them (paragraph 10, last week). The people of Chinaran complain bitterly of the conduct of the Persian troops, who they say are worse than the robbers themselves in regard to thieving. 12. Another good fall of snow throughout the province is reported, and anxiety for the future has ceased. 13. The Samsam-us-Saltanah has telegraphed ordering the appointment of a strong Governor for Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, where at present there is no one to hold the Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan in check. Haji Husain Agha now pro fesses to find that none of his usual cultivators will work on his Jam lands this year for fear of the Barbaris, and has asked me to detail two men to live on the lands until the coming harvest to give confidence to the husbandmen. He suggests that they should be Wo sowars of my escort. 'tl ill 11 i.iBefore acceding to tins modest request X liave sent a confidential assistant to enquire into the^truth of the representations, and to interview Saiyid Haidar; as I suspect that the desire is to embroil me with the Barbaris. 14. Russian affairs. —At a meeting held on the 30th ultimo the Cossacks of the regiment in garrison (paragraph 14, last week) decided to return to their country (Semirechia), notwithstanding the almost certain prospect of being disarmed by the Maximalists as were their compatriots of the 2nd Regiment. The officers are divided in their views, having tried without success to persuade the men to remain. Those of them who have families, with the exception of Colonel Gushchin, the Commandant, will probably accompany the men ; while six of the junior bachelors have asked us to find them some employment. The first party of the regiment is expected to leave on the 5th instant, and the remainder within a day or two later. They have telegraphed to Askabad announc ing their impending arrival. 15. The question of M. de Beauvais is becoming more serious. M. Nicolsky asked me on the 30th ultimo to telegraph again to His Majesty’s Minister ; his anxiety having increased ten fold with the decision of the Cossacks to leave Meshed. Moreover I receive daily reports of M. de Beauvais’ intrigues and incessant abuse of the British, the latest of which states that he points out the wickedness com mitted by us in bringing troops into the Russian sphere of influence ; suggesting that if the agreement of 1907 is annulled both we and the Russians should remove all troop from Persian soil. He is a'so urging the “ Bahar ” to publish orf-British articles. Perhaps his attitude will change with the arrival of a British garrison in Meshed ; if it does not we will then be in a position to deal with him and his sup porters. 16. A telegram has been received by the Karguzar from the Foreign Office directing him to make careful enquiry into all cases of loss sustained by Persian subjects on account of the presence of Russian troops in Khorassan. lie should appoint a commissioner in each district for this purpose. 17. No order has been issued for the transfer of the Russian telegraphist from Kffiaf, and he will probably remain at his post. A robbery occurred in his house recently, but the Governor succeeded in tracing the thieves and recovering the property stolen. 18. In a meeting of the Caucasian Turks which was held during the week it was stated that the Russians in Turkestan and Caucasia were not in favour of a Sunni-Shia’ rapprochement, fearing that the Muslim element would become too strong. Efforts to effect a union of the sects were recommended by various spea kers. 19. Persian and German intrigues. —The British Agent at Karaiz has sent in one Saiyid Darwish who is suspected of being an escaped prisoner from Sistan. He is detained pending enquiry. 20. One Ghulam Shah, who states that he is from Muhammerah, is also tempo rarily detained for investigation. 21. The arrival of British troops in Ivhorassan has been the chief subject of debate in the ''democrat meetings during the past week. The leader, Haji Muhammad Ja’far Kashmiri, suggested that the people should themselves take measures to eject them as there was evidently nothing to be hoped from the present Council of Ministers. It was decided that the proposal should be referred to Tehran for orders. A remark was then made that the Union and Progress Society was becoming powerful, and that it was now advisable to become friendly with them. Subsequently the question of dealing with deserters from the society was raised, and a suggestion that they should be assassinated was vetoed on the ground that an assassination would give the foreigners ground for interference. Finally it was decided to call for weekly reports from all places in which British troops were stationed on the conduct of'the men towards the Persian population.them of h s anfval ^ K *&lt;&gt; democrats at Meshed informing from the Central S , a , bzaw ' ° l n a s P ecIal mission to all branches in Khorassan 110111 tJle tentraI ^mmittee in Tehran.

News from Herat.—The arrival of five families of Turkomans from toTXh , ^ T , Gul J an , is . ported. The Naib-ul-Hukumah had decided tiiem to Kandahar forthwith m accordance with a recent order of the Amir but they prevailed upon him to allow them to remain in Herat until the spring! 28. On the 16th January a man came to Chahar Bagh and said that he was the bearer of a letter for the German party. The Naib-ul-Hukumah summoned him to his presence and read the letter. Later he ordered the man to be confined and finally had him deported to Persia via Kafir Killa. This man is believed to be Lie baiyid Harwesh who has been sent in to Meshed (paragraph 19 above). 27. Enmity between Kazim Beg and the Austrians is increasing: on the 19th Kazim imprisoned his servant Haji Ahmad for not beating von Gruden, which e had ordered him to do as a sequel to a dispute over a horse. The Naib-ul- Hukumah succeeded m effecting a temporary reconciliation. S. 8 ; 0n the 21st Jammry Kazim Beg received a letter from Persia. On the 24th idem he and Lie Maulvi Barkat-ullah visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah who apparently delivered to them the letter mentioned in paragraph 26 above Our Agent has not yet succeeded in discovering the contents of these letters or the subject ol the conversation which passed at the interview. 29. Various preparations for a journey have been made by the Austrians and Kazim Beg during the week, and finally on the 25th von Gruden told the Naib-ul-Hukumah during a visit which the latter paid to the Bagh-i-Kartah that they intended to leave shortly. The Naib asked whether they had received any special news which induced them to go. The Austrian replied that they had not received any information but that their Mehmandar had found them a reliable guide, one Haji Yakub of the Nurzai tribe. . Tbe news of t!lis impending movement has been telegraphed to Sistan and cirjand. We have not yet heard of the actual departure from Herat, but it seems likely that they will take the Persian route. 29-A. The report of the arrival of seven Europeans at Chihil Dukhturan noted last week now appears to be without foundation. Meshed, The 2nd February 1918. W. G.

The latter promises to give us all the help we may require. 2. Persian affairs (local). —It has been arranged that M. Komelis should pay an advance of tumans 1,000 to the Chief of Police on account of his budget, which has not yet been sanctioned. The democrats threaten to take control of all revenue funds in the event of the budget being finally rejected. The matter is really of importance, as the policemen cannot live in these times on their present pay of Izrans two per diem (paragraph 6 last week). 3. The sale of firearms in Meshed city is prohibited, and all arms have been brought to the Nazmiah from the shops of those engaged in the trade. 4. The Town Governor has received a reassuring reply to his telegram to the Samsam-us-Saltanah (paragraph 9 last week), in which the departure of the Samsam from Tehran is promised at an early date. 5. The Rais-i-Kushun has sent in altogether seven robbers (paragraph 11 last week), and several have taken sanctuary in the house of the ubiquitous Haji Husain Agha in addition. The police are watching the premises with the object of arresting any who may come out. The operations in the neighbourhood of Chinaran coutinue. 6. Persian affairs (general). —The Home Office have telegraphed to the Gov ernor of Kuchan asking what steps have been taken regarding the attack upon M. Spinella, the Kuchan Director of Customs. This incident resulted in consider able loss to Government (paragraph 7 of Diary No. 2). 7. Much disorder and distress is reported from Sarakhs, including a fight between Turkomans and a party of Jadids, or Jewish converts to Islam. The sonars mentioned last week have not yet been organised and there is no means of keeping order. 8. The return of Shirvan to the Government of Kuchan seems to have been already accomplished, and the Chief of Bujnurd has telegraphed to the Home Office pointing out that the Governor of Kuchan has now appointed the robber Khuddu as his deputy in Shirvan. He suggests that this fact alone is sufficient reason for the recent orders to be cancelled and Shirvan returned to him. 9. More snow has fallen throughout the province. 10. My messenger has returned from Saiyid Haidar (paragraph 13 last week). As we had supposed, there is no truth whatever in Haji Husain Agha s statement that no person would work on his lands for fear of the Barbaris ; the work is going on without interruption, and there is no need for anyone to go from here. 11. British affairs. —We are at present busily engaged in combating various forms of opposition to the entry of our troops into Khorassan. The local press are still publishing articles from time to time, one of which, entitled ‘ The British and ourselves,” which appeared two days ago in the Bahar, endeavours to show that the British first brought troops into India with the ostensible object of restoring and keeping order, even as they are now doing in Persia, and suggests that the real object, namely, that of obtaining possession of the country, is the same in both cases. We have prepared a reply to this representation, a number of copies of which will be distributed among the educated community. 12. We have found it advisable to publish a denial of the bombardment of the Najaf Shrine by our troops in all the chief local journals, as the irumour had been widely spread and was very generally believed. Meshed 1. Persian% 13. Russian affairs .—evacuation of Meshed by the Cossack regiment has commenced, but yesterday a telegram was recei\ed stating that the Maximalists had sent out a force from Askabad, with machine guns, to await the arrival of the regiment on the frontier, where they were to disarm them ; and the men then held another meeting at which they appear to have decided not to go. lo-day, however, I hear that the parties which have not yet left will proceed to Kuchan, their final destination being arranged subsequently as events may allow. Ihere has been some promiscuous firing in the town by men of the regiment during the last few days, and the general desire of all communities is that Ihey should not remain here. 14. My colleague informs me this morning that he has not received a reply to his request for the transfer of his first secretary M. de Beauvais (paragraph 15 last week), but I think now that the intrigue will die out. The delay in the depar ture of the Cossacks is pleasing to my colleague, as the interval between such departure and the arrival of our men is thereby decreased. We have gi\en the Caucasian party to understand that any action against M. Nicolsky would not be regarded favourably by us. 15. Three Caucasian Turks have been arrested for complicity in the robbery mentioned in paragraph 7 last week. They are confined in the Nazmiah : and their Community are said to be displeased with M. Nicolsky for allowing this. 16. The murder of one Kurban, a Russian subject, is reported from Radkan. No particulars have yet been received. 17. We hear that the Caucasian Committee in Baku have formed a society to send out agents for the spread of unity among Muslims to Turkestan, Azarbaijan, Afghanistan, and other localities ; and have collected a considerable sum of money to pay the necessary expenses. It is highly probable that the preacher at Herat mentioned in paragraph 23 of Diary No. 3 is connected with this movement. They are also said to be trying to obtain arms and ammunition from Afghan istan, and to hold the view that the cessation of hostilities between Germany and Russia is not advisable at present, as it is more favourable to their plans for inde pendence (paragraph 17 of Diary No. , 4 &gt;/ that the unsettled condition of affairs in Russia should continue for some time longer. 18. A notice has been received by the Russian Consulate-General prohibiting the importation into Persia from Russian territory of chinaware, glassware, and ironware. This communication is from the Caucasus Government headquarters at Tiflis. 19. Persian and German intrigues—Two meetings have been held by the local democrats during the week, as usual. At the first an attack was made upon the leader Haji Muhammad Ja'far Kashmiri by some members of the opposing party, and some time was lost before the dispute was abandoned for the moment. The question of British troops in Khorassan was then discussed, and every person pre sent was asked for suggestions or an expression of opinion as to what should be done. . One proposal was that the recent bomb ardment of the N ajaf Shrine by Britisaf troops A- should be used as much as possible to stir people’s feelings against them. Another person supporting this added that the bombardment should also be referred to in the mosques. A third suggested that the Samsam-us-Saltanah should be written to frequently on the subject of the bad intentions of the British towards Persia, and a fourth proposed that threatening messages might be sent to the British Consul- General to frighten him. The subject was finally left for future consideration when news came from Theran as to what was being done there. At the second meeting a proposal from the Caucasian party for co-operation, which had recently been received, was considered. After much discussion the company do not seem to have come to an agreement as to whether the Caucasians ‘could be trusted or not; and a colourless verbal reply was sent, thanking the Turks for their sympathy in democratic aims, and suggesting that they should keep their bad characters in order. The Barbaris were then discussed, and the desirability of preventing for the future their patronage by the British was dwelt upon at great length but no satisfactory proposal was made although it was generally agreed that our recruiting should be stopped if possible.. • 2( \' ( j er - t 1 am s P ecia % ill-disposed persons have induced the local bakers to raise the daily bread-rate by half a kran, and to announce that this augmentation is on account of the coming of British troops to Khorassan. 21. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.-Nfo aikh Abd-ur-Biza, a local mujtahid, was murdered on the night of the 3rd instant returning from the house of a friend. One of the criminals has been arrested. 22. News from. Karaiz. —The grain of Shaukat-ud-Daulah and Shaji-us- Saltanah at Jam and Mahmudabad has been confiscated by the Maliyah represent ative at Karaiz pending the distribution of property which it is proposed to make. 23. It is reported that our detachment at Khaf have engaged the well-known ruffian Mir Yusuf to help in intelligence work, paying him 300 tumans monthly for himself and ten sowars. 24. NewS' from Herat. —The Naib-ul-HukumaJi has issued fresh and strict orders regarding the collection of revenue, particularly requiring the retention of all revenue grain for Government purposes. 25. On the 27th ultimo the Austrians von Gruden and Dimitrovitch visited the bazar and photographed some thieves who had had their limbs amputated. 26. The Naib Solar visited Kazim Beg on the 28th, and discussed with him the condition of Russia ; apparently with no special object. 27. On the 30th three men who had escaped from confinement in Sistan arrived in Herat. They are Abdul Wahab, Jamshid, and Ahmad Barbari. The Naib-ul- Hukumah has sent them to Bagh-i-Kartah. These men seem to have given the Naib lurid accounts of their experiences, and to have worked upon his sympathies to a certain extent; it is to be hoped only temporarily. 28. von Gruden had his horses and mules shod on the 31st ultimo, and other preparations for departure are also being made by the Austrians and their servants. There is nothing more definite, however, this week regarding their probable move ments. 29. Our Agent notes with some concern that recently he has been followed by a Risalah sowar whenever he has ridden out. The object appears to be to find out where he goes and what he does. The Naib Solar is evidently responsible. Meshed : \ W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, The 9th February 1918.

A “ meeting ” between the Cossacks and soldiers was then held at which the former decided that they were not entitled to take over the sugar by force. The Officer in-charge was unable to influence their decision. The discipline of this regiment fs deteriorating. There is much drunkenness, and assaults on Persians'evidently with the object of obtaining money for arrack are increasing in frequency. ^ Escaped prisoner.—The Turkish prisoner noted in paragraph 564.

Some rain and several inches of snow during the week have improved the outlook as regards supplies, and caused some fall m the pre sent exorbitant price of grain. Distress among the poorer classes still prevails Jam continues unsettled owing to the action of the Kaudani Ilbaigi and Mir Baqi Sultan. ° Nusrat-ul-Mulk is reported to have granted land near ZoraW to Jams- iiadis, and some 16 families are said to have arrived there. Zushki and Shikari robbers are still to the fore. Herat and Afghanistan. 9. Germans and adherents.— Kazim Beg is apparently anxious for Gruden and Dimitrovich to leave Herat, and nomad disguise is said to be in prepara tion. At present the Bussian route is indicated for their departure. It is unlikely that with the prevalent Husso-German peace rumours these men would venture into Persia; at the same time the possibility should not be entirely discounted10 Herat Horses from the military stables at Ghurian and Obeh have been brought to Herat for training with the artillery, a correspond ing number of horses having been sent from the city to the above district stables. authority of the Colonel Commanding the artillery, a battery has been despatched from Kabul to reinforce the “1st Artillery ” at Herat. m The Naib Salar at Durbar stated that he had noted a tendency to shorten parade hours in the cold weather This practice was inadmissible, I nTd the Germans would never have attained to their present degree of fortitude and success had they not hardened their troops by training m the most inde- J ment weather md ^ ^ mule i oa ds of military stores, the detail of which has not not yet been obtained, have reached Herat from Kabul. . , 11 Frontier —Foundations for a new frontier post at Zulfiqar m the direction of Pul-i-Khisht are being dug on high ground Five huts have been constructed and it is apparently intended to complete a total of about thirty. 12 Mazar-i-Shariff. —A complete mountain battery from Kabul is reported to have reached Mazar i-Sharif on the 16th of December last. 13 Russian Intelligence. —In spite of internal troubles the General Staff at Tashkent is carrying on its work. The Military Agent yesterday referred to me for confirmation a telegram he had received from Tashkent stating that the Afghans were preparing to attack Kussia, having assembled a large force at Mazar- i*Sharif against Termez as well as a^ concentration of troops at Herat. He was placed in possession of such information as has reached us. Russian Turkistan. 14 Current events. —Communications with Turkistan have been con- siderabiy delayed during the week, probably by heavy snow in the hills, and no papers from Tashkent are to hand. From various sources it appears that matters are—or were recently—very unsettled there, some skirmishes between Maximalist and their opponents having occurred, in consequence of which the former placed machine guns on the streets. The news of M. Dorrer s murder is unfortunately correct. It appears that a party of Sarts and yunkers attacked the prison and released the officials detained there, M. Dorrer being among the number. They were eventually re-captured by the Maxi malists, and M. Dorrer and possibly others were done to death. The local Non-Maximalist authorities of Iranscaspia, of which Colonel Moskalenko—one of the delegates, who visited Meshed soon after the^ outbreak of the revolution—is the head in his capacity as acting Commissary for Transcaspia have exchanged messages of sympathy with the aims of the autonomists at Khoqand. Little is to hand this week regarding the latter, but a correspondent from Khojent states that the mass of the people are apathetic as to this movement which is beyond their comprehension. Failing the authority of Russia they imagine that Turkistan must depend^ either from Afghanistan, Bokhara, or Turkey, and it is probable that the originators of the movement will have some difficulty in bringing their aims within the compre hension of their more ignorant countrymen and co-religionists. The officials of the Transcaspian administration at Askhabad refused to acknowledge Maximalist authority, or to abandon their posts—the alternative with which they were confronted. Three of the senior officials were arrested by the Maximalists, but soon afterwards released. The “ national commissaries, have declared Colonel Moskalenko’s appointment null and void, and have proclaimed themselves as the sole authority. There is, however, much tacit resistance to them at Askhabad, and to the position of martial law^ which they have declared. Afghans and Persians without passports or with irregular documents are being ejected from towns in Turkistan and Transcaspia. Notice has been given that no passengers except military and pupils proceeding to educational establishments will for the present be granted passage by the Tashkent line, and the Central Asian railway has ceased the issue of tickets beyond Tashkent.

Khorasan and North-East Persia. „ ,, ^ 5 1 force—No decision has yet been reached with regard to the move el w// or sZhechif S ‘Y'fnrkf 11 ^ 311 Ee ' iment has Astrabad en oute tor feemnecJiia. A further telegram has been received from the Com- missary for Mihtary Affan-s Petrograd to the effect that the 1st rcimenHs not to be moved from Persia, winle the orders from the Yoisko for the m“ve to be completed are still insistent. Telegrams from here have been despatched to both parties and replies are still awaited. The situation is still further com! plicated by the attitude of the men. Unwilling to leave Persia for Sa Kurghan, the Cossacks eagerly welcomed the idea of returning to their own district. The hitch they attribute to the machinations of their Officers and if the Yoisko continues to insist on departure there is a chance that they may take the matter into their own hands and depart on their own account fh he ?Tffi ie u- alU r !i be f tud y 1 1 n S ™ utes b y which they could avoid Tashkent, and the difficulties of the long desert marches have not apparently occurred to them. As long as A oisKo and Maximalist staff are at variance no satisfactory solution can be expected. An order from the Y'oisko for the troops to remain would probably secure obedience, but its issue at present does not appear likely, the Maximalists have a comparatively easy means of keeping them in Persia by refusing railway transport; this is realised and at a recent regimental meeting it was resolved to despatch delegates to Tashkent to arrange for Mans- port facilities. ° (2) The attitude of the men to their officers may be gathered from the following incident. Five young officers—2 attached and 3 belonging to the regiment had resolved that under present political conditions they would not return to Russia but would offer their services where they could best be utilised at the front. They recently purchased an automobile which perhaps aroused suspicion^ One of them in a letter to his home, entrusted to the Cossack post, had mentioned his intentions. By some means not yet clear the men opened and read the letter, and clamoured for the arrest of the officers in question. A stormy meeting ensued at which the Officer Commanding presided, and the Cossacks with violence at last decided that the officers should be turned out without delay. The officers left in their car for Tehran at an early hour this morning. 16. Persian Cossack Brigade. —Lieutenant-Colonel Mechetich left for ISovocherkask on the 12th instant, having apparently been summoned on a confidential matter. He stated^ that he expected to return within the month. Captain Kuznetsov officiates for him in the meantime. This formation has now com pleted the enlistment of 500 infantry, and may now proceed, if orders are received to raise a second 500. About 70 cavalry only have been obtained. Colonel Mechetich states that he is now obtaining a far better stamp of man than at first came forward, and he is discharging the unsuitable men at first enlisted as opportunity offers. 17. Escaped prisoner .—An Indian deserter, presumably from the Meso- ! potamian Labour Corps, was brought in yesterday in the last stage of exhaus tion, and died from exposure and hunger without being able to state his identity. 18 Local. —Sardar-i-Intisar, the newly appointed military commander, has been entrusted with the ad interim direction of affairs in Khorasan, but during his absence with a force despatched against the Zushki robbers, his brother, Mutammid-ul-Vuzarah, is to act for him.

He adds that he cannot be responsible for any disturbances which may occur in the event of these rennp«f a not being granted. requests 8. Persian affairs (general).—There is general rejoicing over the prospect of the return of Shirwan to the Government of Kuchan. A number of villagers had apparently already commenced to emigrate to Russian territory on account of the tyranny of the Chief of Bujnurd’s sowars, but the welcome news of the change has altered their plans. The Chief of Bujnurd complains to Tehran of the raids of the Goklan Turkomans, and proffers the usual request for ammunition. 9. Pussian affairs.—The disappearance of another Cossack on the Kuchan road is reported. M. de Beauvais is again going out to make enquiries. 10. The Amir of Bokhara has sent a medal and message of thanks to M. de Beauvais in recognition of his work in Meshed on behalf of Bokhara subjects 11. There is no present prospect of M. Nicolsky being relieved of his appoint ment as Consul-General here, and no news of his successor. ^ 12. The question of the Russian troops in Khorassan (paragraph 11 last week) is not yet decided. '13 Persian and German intrigues. —There is as usual much British talk in the democrat meetings; and a proposal has been made to enter into negotiations with the Afghans with a view to incite them against us, though with whom exactly is not stated. It is suggested to send to Afghanistan newspapers containing anti- British articles. 14. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—The arrival at Jam of Saiyid Mirza Hassan, the envoy of Aghazadah, is reported, but the Ilbaigi Kaudani will not listen to him and continues to illtreat the people of Jam, knowing that he has Haji Hussain Agha at his back. 15. The presence of a robber band of 50 Afghans on the Jam-Karaiz road is reported by our dak sowars, and they are said to have plundered the property of Haji Hussain Agha in that neighbourhood. 16. Neivs from ifarafz.—Shuja-ul-Mulk informed our Agent that the Persian Government had not replied to his telegram stating the conditions upon which he was prepared to take up the government of J am in addition to that of Bakhurz, and that therefore he did not intend at present to send anyone to Jam as his deputy. The fact is that he considers the Ilbaigi’s position too strong, and will not place himself in a false position. 17. News from The Governor of Kuhsan reports that Saiyid Ahmad Beg Jamshidi has come to Jamrud to assist the Ilbaigi Kaudani against the Barbaris and that his presence in that neighbourhood renders the Karaiz road unsafe. (This may be one of the Afghan robbers mentioned in paragraph 15 above.) 18. The death of Juma Khan, late Commandant of the Kandahari Regiment, is reported to have taken place on the 22nd ultimo. 19. The Governors of Ghurian and Kushan, having been ordered to report on the supposed existence of a spring of kerosine oil on the Kuhsan frontier, state that there was such a spring but that it has been washed away by a flood occasioned by the overflowing of the banks of the river near which it was situated. 20. The Naib-ul-IIukumah has referred for the orders of the Amir the case of twelve families of Turkomans recently arrived from Russian territory whom he wished to settle in Farah, as they preferred to remain in the neighbourhood of Herat. 21. A heavy fall of snow in the .hills around Herat is reported, and good rain has fallen in the city. 22. Kazim Beg has received a letter from Sidik Beg (paragraph 27 of Diary No. 43), announcing his safe arrival at Kabul. 23 Nasrullah purchased on the 22nd ultimo two Afghani caps and two shirts of coarse cloth, and took them to Kazim Beg. These purchases, and those of two Turkoman saddles and bridles which were made on the 28th idem ; and also the fact that Kazim’s servant Asghar is making enquiries from the Turkomans men tioned in paragraph 20 above for a guide, tend to confirm the report that Kazim intends to leave Afghanistan via Russia. 24. Further dissensions between the Austrians and the Persian staff of the party are reported : this time Maulvi Barkatullah succeeded in effecting a reconciliation. 25. The news of the recent Italian reverses has reached Herat, and is being made much of by Kazim Beg’s servants, who lose no opportunity to spread anti- British information. They have also denied the capture of the party which left Herat recently. 26. Referring to paragraph 25 last week it seems that the Turkoman'who was supposed to be the chief of the two new arrivals is the guide and interpreter of the other, who is a messenger from the Sirdar Kurban Muhammad who left Herat a few months ago. He has brought an application signed by the representatives of no less than 180,000 families of Turkomans of the Akhal Urganj begging to become Afghan subjects in order that they may find release from Cossack tyranny. This application has been taken by the Naib-id-Hukumah for submission to the Amir. Meshed : q W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, l His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and The 5th January 1918. ) Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C5S7FD—6-2-18 o0 A.A.■ ■ m CONFIDENTIAf 4 Meshed Diary No. 2 lor the week ending the 12th January 1918. 1. Persian officials. —There is a slight improvement in the Karguzars condition, but he is not yet fit for work. Ff rs ^ n °ff airs {local). —Haji Husain Agha has replied to the telegram received by him from the Samsam- us-Saltanah, expressing his thanks and represent ing that the Harbaris have run wild throughout the province, plundering and murdering in all directions. He again requests the Samsam to redress his personal grievances. In consequence of this misrepresentation and the intrigues of Nasrat-ul-Mulk (paragraph 2 of Diary No. 52 and previous reports) who is now in Tehran, the Samsam has telegraphed to Saiyid Haidar ordering him to cease from raiding, and threatening him with severe punishment at the hands of his Bakhtiari sowars in the e\ ent of non-compliance^with this order. Misled by false reports from Nasrat- ul-Mulk, who represents that Shaji-us-Saltanah and Saiyid Haidar are raiding the country together, the Samsam has also sent Shaji a warning ordering him to desist on pain of punishment. Meanwhile Jam and its neighbourhood are quiet, but owing to the absence of the Rais-i-Kushun from town we have not yet been able to arrange the appoint ment of a temporary Governor : the Rais being the principal member of the Gov ernment commission (paragraph 1 of Diary No. 52). 3. The Rais-i-Kushun having heard that one Kambar Agha whom he had sent out to deal with certain Zushki robbers had met with a reverse at their hands, left Meshed on the 6th instant with 50 men. It is reported that the Zushki and Shikari outlaws have combined to oppose him, and his operations are not likely to be successful. He has asked the War Office by telegram to supply him with arms and ammunition, but has received the reply that no arms can be issued until the Cabinet has been reconstituted. The leader of one gang of Shikari robbers has been captured in the city, and permission for his execution has been requested from Tehran. 4. It appears from a recent statement submitted to Tehran by M. Kornelis that the yearly revenue of the province of Khorassan amounts to 500,000 tumans, of which only 80,000 is remitted to Tehran, the remainder being deducted for local expenditure on Government departments. On account of the famine it has not been possible this year to realise the usual amount. 5. Partly owing to the dissensions among the local democrates, which are dealt with elsewhere, the local branch of the “ Union and Progress ” society is daily becoming stronger. They have telegraphed to Tehran recommending the appoint ment of the Naiyir-ud-Daulah as Governor-General, apparently with the desire to oppose the democrats, by whom his presence in Khorassan is not desired. 6. Persian affairs {general)—The Governor of Khaf telegraphs to Meshed that his Karasuran having received no pay have dispersed, and that his district is in danger from the raids of Afghan robbers from across the border. He urges the formation of his Karasuran without delay with definite arrangements for their regular payment. 7. M. Delcord has just sent me over a telegram from his director at Dajgiran which informs him that the director was held up by robbers when coming from Kuchan yesterday, and relieved of a large sum of money, the property of the Customs department. 8. A raid upon the village of Paz by the Naib-ul-Hukumah of Tabatkan on the pretext that robbers were concealed therein is reported by some of the inhabitants, who have come to Meshed to complain. 9. Minor encounters between Barbaris and Taimuris are reported from Kelat and Sarakhs. These are part of the enmity which existsbetween the two tribesbut Saiyid Haidar is not responsible as the Barbaris concerned Bare not in his section of the tribe. 10. British affairs. —The usual Durbar and lunch for British Indian subject and British proteges was held on the 8th instant, having been postponed from the 1 st owing to my indisposition. The company were briefly addressed on the subject of the past year’s events and future prospects in connection with the war. 11. The Iftikhar-ul-Wa’izin, a Law Department inspector and former member of the Majlis who is at present in Meshed, having desired to discuss political matters with me I interviewed him on the 10th instant. His views seem to be that it is our duty to supply Persia with as much money as she may desire without receiving anything in exchange but promises of friendship and good will, and he does not appear to understand that a free bargain must contain an element of real advantage to more than one of the contracting parties. 12. We learn from the Officer Commanding British troops in Sistan that he is taking over the cordon of posts now being evacuated by the Russians as far as Khaf. This is not the same line as that held by them, but on the whole it seems to be a more suitable one as fewer men will be employed and certain posts occupied which for political and commercial reasons it is desirable to watch. For example, Khaf itself has been in a state of disturbance throughout the past year, and it lies on the direct Sistan-Meshed trade route. 13. Russian affairs. —With reference to the preceding paragraph definite orders for the withdrawal of the Cossack regiment which garrisons Meshed and sup plies the cordon have been received, but my colleague and the Commandant, the former for political and the latter for regimental reasons, are both doing their utmost to have the order rescinded. It would probably be better from the point of view of present conditions at Tehran that our troops should not replace the Russians in this province, as we are sure to be charged with fresh malevolent intentions towards this country. 14. During the past week we have been approached by four young officers of the Cossack regiment referred to who wish to desert and secure employment in the British or failing that the American army. They say that the Commandant, while unable to countenance their desertion, is prepared to shut his eyes to their move ments and to take no steps to trace them unless obliged to by circumstances. We have merely listened sympathetically to their representations, but one of them who is well-to-do has procured a motor car and I hear to-day that they intend to start for Sistan almost immediately. 15. The acting Persian Agent at Askabad has telegraphed to the Foreign Office asking for a guard of 15 Persian Cossacks for the protection of the Persian subjects residing in Askabad. He expresses fear of trouble from the Turkomans who have become bold since the recent declaration of autonomy in Turkestan. 16. M. Nicolsky has received a telegram from the Caucasus Government informing him that his transfer to Tehran is deferred for the present, and that he will remain here until April at least. He informed me yesterday that M. de Bra vine,. a recent Vice-Consul at Birjand, had been appointed Russian Minister in Tehran ; he being the only officer of the Persian service who had accepted the Bolshevik Gov ernment. M. Nicolsky supposes that the Persian Government will refuse to accept M. de Bravine on account of his youth and inexperience 17. Persian and German intrigues. —The democrats in Meskea are now divided, mere or less definitely, into two parties: one under the leadership of Haji Muhammad .la far Kashmiri and Prince Mustafa Mirza, and the other under Shaikh Kazim Balur Farush end Shaikh Ahmed, the editor of the “ Bahar ”. To this latter party the Aghazadah and the Rais-ut-Tujjar also belong. The Kashmiri’s party appear to have little connection or influence with Tehran, but the Balur Farush is a relative of the Malik-ush-ShuTa, and the letters from the latter which are reported from time to time as having been read in the secret meet ings are addressed to him. Recently about forty democrats have transferred their allegiance to the society of Lmion and Progress (paragraph 5 above), their principal reason being that they had been deceived by Haji Hussain Agha and the Rais-ut-Tuj'jar who, for reasons of their own, had induced them to oppose the returnNaiyir-^-Daulah to Khorassan. The feeling seems to be that the Naiyir is n »,w „„ V6 t /r” at °. nce to Provide bread at a reasonable price, and regret is now general that his appointment was cancelled. in comnatv^ftww't 11 'f'c P , ris ? ner of . war left for Q u etta on the 6th instant com P an y w,, i | a batch of Barban recruits for the 124th Baluch Infantry. llhaim rur ' Mt ;if h f kh Jam.—Mh Baki Sultan is still at Jam, while the llbaigi Kaudani has retired to Jamrud.

The Naib-ul-Hukumah has sent to Chakhansur sixteen families of Baluch immigrants who came in from Russian territory via Gulran. 22. On the 29th ultimo Kazim Beg advised the two Austrians to leave Herat as soon as possible, saying that there was no advantage in their remaining in Afghan- istan. Rerhaps on this account a rumour is current that they intend to leave shortly. iN asrullah purchased two longboats, as worn by nomads, for them on the 29th. , . R az i m Beg, during a visit to the Naib Solar on the 3rd instant, informed inm that peace was established between the Russians and Germans ; that Britain had desired peace, which was refused by Germany ; and that France was now suing .tor peace. He stated moreover that much of Russia would become Turkish terri tory. 24. A Turkoman visited Kazim Beg on the night of the 3rd whom, it is said, he intends to engage as a guide to conduct him to Turkey via Russia. 25. The two Turkomans mentioned in paragraph 26 last week are still in Herat v aiting for the reply of the Amir to their petition. Kilich Murad, the messenger of Kurban Muhammad, complains that his interpreter has not made the matter clear to the Naib-ul-Hukumah, and bewails his own inability to speak Persian. 26. It is said that Wagner’s late servant Agha Karim is searching for a guide to conduct him to Meshed. W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. Meshed ; The 12th January 1918.INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY NUMBER 1 FOR THE WEEK ENDING THE 5th JANUARY, 1918. Khorasan and North-East Persia. 1. Bussian force.--The Officer Oommanding the 1st Semirechia Regiment has received orders that all Cossacks of the 1911 and 1912 classes, destined for the 2nd Semirechia Regiment, should reach Askhabad by the 13th instant. These number 230 in all, and in consequence of this temporary depletion he is unable to find men for the posts south of Turbat-i-Haidari. He is, therefore issuing orders for the evacuation on the 8th instant of all posts from Rum (inclusive) up to but excluding Turbat-i-Haidari which he will continue to occupy till the question of departure is finally settled. . officer who has just returned from Samarkand states that little information is available there, but as far as can be ascertained from various sources the object of the move of the 1st regiment is to provide some troops for the General Officer Commanding, Turkistan Cossack Division at Samarkand, who is at present practically without any. The arrival of the delegates from Semirechia will be awaited before any other steps towards evacuation are taken. Their whereabouts are at present unknown and a telegram has been despatched to Samarkand enquiring as to their movements. 2. The Officer in charge of the 50 men returning to Semirechia (Intelli gence Summary 51 of 1917, paragraph 554 (2) ), has telegraphed that the rail way accommodation asked for at Askhabad has not been provided and that the party indefinitely detained. The same difficulties will probably occur for the passage (E) of the Semirechia Regiments. (3) A Cossack has been found killed a few miles to the S. of Kuchan. The 1st Secretary and Medical Officer of the Russian Consulate-General with an officer from the regiment have proceeded to Kuchan to investigate the affairs. 2. Local affairs .—During the indisposition of the Karguzar, the temporary commission, in which Hajji Hussain Agha has not after all been included, continues to administer affairs. Much distress owing to the exorbitant price of bread prevails at Meshed and deaths from hunger have occurred among the poorest class. Insecurity on roads continues, the frontier belt from Sarakhs to and including the Jam district being particularly unsafe. Meetings advocating the union of Shiah and Sunni have been held, and Caucasian Musulmans were loud in approbation of the sentiments expressed. 1 Herat and Afghanistan. 3. Germans and adherents .—Kazim Beg and party are reported to have been so depressed at the news of the arrest of the Austrians that they did not appear in public for several days. They appear to have recovered somewhat and to be continuing their pro-German propaganda. From the fact of Kazim Beg having applied for Turkoman guides his intention to escape via Russian terrritory is not unlikely. One Ahmad, a Herati originally detained here on suspicion and subsequently subsidized, reported having indicated a messenger of Kazim Beg to the Russian post at Sharifabad for arrest. As the suspect did not materialise I requested the Russians to obtain a report from Sharifabad. The non-commissioned officer in charge states that the suspect was indicated as reported by Ahmad, but that seeing that he was an old man, he himself did not consider him suspicious and permitted him to proceed on his way. 4. Herat troops .—A brigadier and 6 colonels are reported to be on their way from Kabul to Herat; the brigadier and 2 colonels for appointment to the cavalry, 3 colonels to the infantry, and 1 to the artillery. (2) A farman has been received from Muin-as-Saltanah asking for the following particulars : — {a) return of guns fit for service together with ammunition available, and a list of artillery requirements still deficient. {h) the number of breech-loading rifles and ammunition on charge.' - i i |,‘»li' -f:.; I ilfoli w -I (c) tlie namber of recruits obtained by the 1 per 8 conscription (hash- tyaJc or hasht nafri), and units to which posted. (3) The Naib Salar has inspected the Kandahari, Jadidi Kabuli, and 3rd Herati battalions, the proficiency of the first two having been [considered satis factory but that of the 3rd Herati below the mark. Russian Turkistan. 5. Current events .—As far as it is possible to judge at present the declara tion of the autonomy of Turkistan has considerably weakened the hands of the maximalists. The conduct of the leading musulmans so far appears to be moderate and icspired by a sincere desire for the restoration of order, and they have with them the best and most intelligent elements of the Russian popula tion, who consider their action the sole alternative at present to the mob rule of the maximalists. The latter, while expressing satisfaction at the declaration of autonomy as a manifestation of the freedom won by the revolution, ^ state that there can only be one authority in the land—that vested in the soviets and that the usurpation of authority by any other body is therefore illegal and will be suppressed. The present attitude of the soldiers on whom the maxima lists chiefly depend is likely still further to weaken their cause. The soldiers are freely leaving their stations without leave for their homes, stating that their committees have declared this course admissible. The 8th Siberian Reserve Regiment at Askhabad was recently summoned by the maximalists at Tashkent to their assistance and refused to move, on the ground that they refused to be drawn into dissensions and intended shortly to proceed to their homes, and the papers state that the 2nd Siberian Reserve Regiment at Tashkent—one of those chiefly concerned in the overthrow of the Provisional Government in Turkistan—and representatives of the 1st Turkistan Army corps have expressed sympathy with the aims of the autono mists at Kokand. The latter have proceeded to the election of 7 “ ministers ” all of whom except one, who holds the portfolio for finance and bears a Russian name, are musulmans. Some anti-maximalist disturbance is said to have occurred recently at Tashkent, Sarts being reported to have broken open the prison and released the late Assistant Commissioner, M. Dorrer, whose trial resulted in his con viction for having taken part in disarming Siberian troops at Tashkent, and a sentence of 3 years and 4 months’ imprisonment. A telegram received by the Russian Rank at the end of last week reported his murder, but this appears to be incorrect. The maximalists are in complete possession of Samarkand, where the Cossack garrison is for the moment less than one squadron ; their relations with the Cossacks are bad. At Askhabad they have declared martial law, and recently arrested the Manager and another official of the Ranque d’Escompte for disobedience to their orders, 'which probably resolved themselves into the general com mandeering of all pecuniary supplies. Their position at Askhabad, however, does not appear to be very secure; in particular as they have alienated the Turkoman community, and hopes are entertained by intelligent Russians that maximalist rule in Turkistan will not endure for long. Crimes of violence continue frequent both in towns and in outlying districts, and under the present regime no diminution can be expected. An officer recently arrived from Turkistan states that the situation for the moment is exceedingly obscure, and little information in one place is available of what is occurring in another. Hopes, however, are generally centred on the failure of the maximalist movement. Krasnovodsk and the railway thence are crowded by soldiers flocking from the Caucasus front, both men who have been released from service and deserters. So far there has been no question of the liberation of the prisoners of war. E. A. E. REDE, Lieut- Colonel, General Staff Officer. Meshed ; ') 1st January 1918. 6 G.P L, Delhi - No. 11D3 C. G.

The friction between Hisam-ud-Dauleh and Samsam-ud-Dauleh seems to be increasing as the latter’s patience is getting exhausted. His attempts to collect a little rent, supported lukewarmly by Shaukat-ul-Mulk, are being resisted by Hisam’s men. It is said that Samsam has arranged for a Mamur to be sent from Tehran as arbitrator and that he has already remitted 700 Tomans to the officer for his travelling expenses. If the officer is Ebtihaj-us-Sultan, Samsam’s brother-in-law, Hisam is likely to object vigorously to the appointment. The Customs Department, Sistan. See last week’s diary.

Gun-runners. Haji Gulab Gurgich, the notorious gun-runner who surrendered in Sarhad to General Dyer and was I believe taken into the Sarhad Levy Corps for a few months, after which he returned to Afghanistan {vide Diary No. 21 of 1917), is now said to have proclaimed a blood-feud aganist the Brahuis of the Sistan Levy Corps on account of the death of his son in the fight at Leradik, the latter having participated m the raid of Sarhaddis against Sistani maldars (flock-owners). A brother of our Risaldar Nazar Jan has already been fired at, though the offender was not identified.

We have not yet finished with Haji Husain Agha in connection with this affair. He has received a nattering telegram from the Samsam, who regrets to hear that he has been so badly treated by the Barbaris and promises to exterminate them on arrival. It is to be hoped that this is merely a specimen of Persian political work which will have no sequel. ? laS k een ^ ntense during the past week, and more than an inch of snow has fallen in the town and considerably more in the neighbourhood. The price of wheat has fallen somewhat, and arrangements are in progress to bring in quantities from those piaces in which this welcome change is most apparent. 4. The Samsam-us-Saltanah telegraphs to the Deputy Governor that he will leave Tehran for Meshedwhen the approaching reorganisation of the Cabinet is concluded. Meanwhile he directs that no change is to be made in the relationship of Shirwan to Bujnurd until he arrives : and that the present Rais-i-Nazmiah is to continue in office. He states, moreover, that the proposed budget for police expenditure is about to receive sanction. 5. Persian affairs ((/enera/).—Complaints have again come in from the Karguzar of Sarakhs, who states that danger from Turkomans is increasing with their independence, and that the present Governor is not competent to deal with the situation. He also reports that Baluch and Sistani robbers are active in the district. 6. The cholera at Bujnurd is now said to have fallen to two cases or so daily. 7. British affairs. The Rais-i-Adaliyah has been ordered to make a judicial enquiry into the claim of Haji Muhammad Ibrahim Hakkak to British Indian nationality, and to report the result to Tehran, after which it is said orders will be passed. I am also making enquiry from India, as some honest doubt on the subject seems to exist. . j, . 8. Many more camels laden with sugar have arrived from Karaiz (paragraph 11 last week), and goods to the value of six lakhs of rupees have just come in via Sistan. M. Delcorde was under the impression that the temporary congestion of traffic on the Herat-Meshed road was due to the Barbari-Taimuri troubles, and was highly indignant because he supposed that the Russians were intriguing and fanning the disturbances in order to interfere with our successful increase in trade. When j I explained the true state of affairs to him his only remark was that in any case they are quite capable of such conduct. 9. Russian affairs. —My colleague has asked me to raise a subscription among our subjects and proteges for the relief of his own, which, considering that all aresuffering from the general famine conditions, and that the Russians are at present causiniAis the maximum amount of inconvenience in more ways than one, must be one of the coolest requests on record. I am giving a small personal contribu tion, but to pass round a list does not seem to be possible. 10. For the first time on record the birthday of the Muhammadan Prophet was celebrated separately by the local Russian Mussalmans on the 27th instant. No special importance is attributed to this event. 11. It appears that the prisoners brought in by M. deBeauvais from Chinaran (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 49) were not the men responsible for the death of the Cossack, and two more robbers have now been despatched to Meshed who are believed to be the real culprits. 12. The question of the departure of the Russian troops from Khorassan is still under consideration, but it appears to be likely at the time of writing that they will eventually go. 13. Persian and German intrigues. —The central democrat committee have despatched to Tehran a complimentary letter ad iressed to the Government of the Caucasus, which after approval by their Tehran friends will be sent on by the latter. Similar letters from Turkestan are being prepared. 14. As usual, letters from Tehran were read in the weekly meetings. Further account is given of the dissensions still existing in Tehran democrat circles which are, as before, attributed to the British and their friends. The condition of the Shah’s entourage is especially deplored in this week’s letters : it is said to consist only of corrupt and disloyal scoundrels who are all conspiring to ruin the democrat society. This is followed by abuse of the Cabinet: it is stated that the Ministers complain that they are not able to appoint Governors to the provinces as the democrats promptly object and the nominations have to be cancelled. Hope for the future is held out however in the fact that the numbers of persons joining the society are increasing steadily. Another letter deals with threatening messages received by the democrats from the Shah, and a subsequent not very successful attempt which was made to see His Majesty and explain. The explanations seem to have been very coldly received. This letter states that in Tehran matters are now so unsatisfactory that democrats cannot leave their houses during the night, and have to go about armed by day. 15. We have secured another escaped prisoner—a Turk. He will probably be despatched to India with a batch of Barbari recruits who will be leaving in a few days. 16. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Our Agent reports that Zabi Khan, the Karasuran chief who arrested the German party recently, has been appointed Russian Agent in Turshiz. The circumstances in which this man allowed Wagner to escape still require clearing up, and I hope to arrive at the truth soon. 17. The newly appointed provisional Government of Khorassan had decided to eject Adal-ud-Daulah from the Government of Turbat and reinstate our friend Mujtaba Mirza, but the Samsam has telegraphed directing that no such changes should be made until he arrives. 18. A good fall of snow and rain has caused the price of wheat to fall from tumans 48 to 36 per kharvar. 19. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Fakir Muhammad Sultan, Shuja-ul- Mulk’s Naib-ul-Hukumah at Karaiz, visited Saiyid Haidar (paragraph 2 above) and arranged with him for the despatch of Shaukat-ud-Daulah to Meshed. He then returned to Karaiz. 20. The Ilbaigi's sowars have raided some more villages near Jam. 21. News from Herat. —The Governor of Gulran has sent in to Herat ten families of Turkomans who desire to emigrate from Russian Sarakhs. The Naib-ul- Huku-mah has directed that Khalisah lands be given to them near Ubih, on the usual conditions.. 22 ‘ Kazim Beg is said to have remarked to his guard on the 15th instant, when seeing them at drill, how much he had done to improve the efficiency of the * troo P s during his stay in their country, pointing out that it was on account ot this increase in efficiency that the British Government had been obliged so largely to raise the subsidy paid by them to the Afghans. 23. Nasrullah announced in the town on the 17th instant that the Germans | and lurKS had conquered the Caucasus, and would soon send an army through I lehran to the Afghan frontier under Wagner. He added that he had received a letter from the latter on this subject. 24. Kazim Beg visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah and Naib Solar at Bagh-i-Shah on the 18th. He told them that he had just received a special letter describing a visit of repentance paid by the Sharif of Mecca to the Sultan of Turkey on which occasion the Sharif handed over to the Turkish Government all the arms and ammumtion recently supplied to him by the British. Tte letter further described how the Turks equipped with these same arms an army which had since ejected the British from both Egypt and Mesopotamia. How the Afghan officials received this nonsense is not stated. 25. On the 20th Kazim Beg received the news of the disaster which had over taken Wagner’s party. He called on the Naib Solar and told him what he had heard, viz., that the Russians had caught and taken them to Meshed. Kazim appears to have complained bitterly, not for the first time, that the reports of the British Agent at Herat, made with the permission of the Afghan Government, were responsible for their frequent misfortunes. i 26 ’ Tlie Turkoman Sirdar (paragraph 29 last weak) is still in the stable of Chahar Bagh, where he receives rations, etc., from the Afghan Government, but our Agent says that he is so closely watched that he cannot at present find out anything more about him.

't-c ? c(a9- * 554. Russian force —Colonel Gustchin yesterday received a telegram from the Ataman of the Semirechia Voisko at Vyerni, ordering him to concentrate the 1st Semirechia Cossacks at regimental headquarters at Meshed prepara tory to leaving Persia. The signal to depart would be the arrival of delegates on their way from Vyerni to Meshed. Further instructions were given as to handing over Cossacks of a certain age at Askhabad to the 2nd Semirechia Regiment (now at Astrabad), and completing his establishment from certain independent sotnyas now in Turkistan. The purpose of the order is not yet clear and it is thought that it may be in connection with the recent Cossack Session at Novocherkask where, according to delegates who have just returned here thence, a resolution was passed that all Cossack units should return to their own districts. Should this be the case it is probable that all Cossack units now in Persia would be recalled, and as there is no mention of relief the application of the measure would spell evacuation. Should the movement extend to Turkistan also that region would be completely in maximalist hands. On further reconsideration of the telegram Colonel Gustchin thinks that it may denote some concerted Cossack action other than noted above. He was unsuccessful in communicating yesterday with the 2nd Regiment at Astrabad who may have further knowledge. In any case he is telegraphino* to the Voisko that he is unable to comply with the order pending the receipt of considerable funds, as his unit is very considerably indebted to the Russian Bank already. He estimates that from the date of his order to concentrate to his departure from Meshed some 3 weeks would elapse. Had the order emanated from the maximalist commander of the Turkistan Military District, a curious situation might well have arisen. Coming from the chief of the Voisko there is no question of disregarding the order. It is, however, considered not improbable that if the measure does not meet the maximalist views the departure of the Cossacks from Askhabad may be opposed. (2) An order was published some 2 months ago that all soldiers from Semirechia whose property had especially suffered during the Kirghiz rising of last year were to be permitted to return to their homes. It has now been applied to the 1st Semirechia Cossacks and 50 men are leaving on that account. (3) The party noted last week as proceeding to Dushakh reached the stage Amirabad in the dark. The villagers, thinking they were robbers, called to them to give the village a wide berth, and, on disregard of the caution, fired a volley, killing 4 horses. The Cossacks returned the fire and two of the villagers were killed. The incident, due entirely to an unfortunate misunderstanding, has been arranged. 555. Austrian prisoners .—The 3 Austrian and 2 Turkish prisoners were despatched under Russian escort to Rum on the 20th instant. A Cossack officer who commanded the patrol to Khaf, and afterw ards pro ceeded to Said-ud-Din, states that he is convinced that the statement that the German party passed the day at Khaf itself is untrue. (In view of the secrecy of their movements, the presence of the telegraph, and of a Russian agent at Khaf, it appeared improbable). He considers that there is no doubt that the prisoners were either permitted to escape from Said-ud-Din, or hidden for the time, and his account of the premises coincides with that of my agent and not with that of the Austrians. He ascribes the fact that the 3 Austrians were produced, to Persian fear of possible consequences if all were permitted to go free. 556. Local affairs .—The Taimuris, under the Ilbaigi, are now reported to be raiding around Jam. o.Robberies continue on roads, and there is much distress among the poor at Meshed owing to the exorbitant price of bread. Deaths from hunger are stated to have occurred. ! The Provincial Director of Customs states that the smuggling of arms into Persia from Russian territory is increasing. Pour seizures of arms and ammunition were made at Bajgiran on one day only, and the proportion seized probably represents a very small fraction of those that get through. It is to be hoped that the rumoured proximate arrival of Samsan-as- Saltanah as Governor-General may be correct. Russian Musulmans here have given notice of a meeting at which Russian and in particular Caucasian affairs will be discussed. Some snow has fallen. Herat and Afghanistan. 557. Germans and adherents .—In the Herat report, dated the 14th instant, Kazim Beg was stated to be present, and no apparent signs of approching departure were noted. 558. Military affairs .—The “ 1st Artillery ” were excused garrison duties pending inspection by the Naib Salar. The inspection was pronounced satis factory and the Naib Salar presented each captain with a watch on its con clusion. News has been received at Herat that General Muhammad Naim Khan, the late commander of the garrison, has been appointed to the command of the troops at Jalalabad. 559. Frontier .—A squadron of the Turki regiment has left Herat for the Anardarrah frontier in relief. Rissaldar Yar Muhammad Khan is now reported fit for return to duty to Chihildukhtaran. His promotion to a higher rank is probable. Russian Turkistan. 5G0. Current events .—There is again no news in such papers as have come to hand, and the Russians themselves here are much in the dark as to how matters are proceeding. In reports which have reached me referring to the end of last and the early portion of this month, it is evident that the maximalists have been busy annexing funds and levying pecuniary contribu tions wherever possible, refusal to contribute being punished with arrest. Action of this nature is reported from Samarkand and Kaghan. At Kaghan also Russians of the poorer class, apparently driven by hunger looted the railway treasury, and also meditated a descent on Bokhara. The question of supplies is rendered more acute by present conditions, and Orenburg has refused to permit grain for Ferghana to proceed, fearing that it will be intercepted by the maximalists at Tashkent. The Amir of Bokhara has been approached by the Russians to contribute grain, but stated that he was unable to do so. Brices at Bokhara itself rule very high, and the Afghan and British-Indian subjects residents there are said to have been warned to collect their debts as soon as possible and to carry out further transactions in cash, in the event of scarcity rendering their evacuation necessary. The Amir agreed to depute certain officials to assist the Russians in sealing grain stores, but privately ordered the Governors of the places concerned to arrange for riots and to beat the Bokharan deputies. (2) The question of German and Austrian prisoners in Turkistan under present conditions is likely to prove a thorny one. Austrian prisoners were recently heard to preach energetically peace propaganda to Russian soldiers who were told that they could end the war as soon as they chose. An Austrian officer added that this would not be sufficient, but that all British and I French representatives must first be ejected from Russia. The officers now enjoy complete liberty and enemy agents in Turkistan are not far to seek.s Jfc. ) tte coni •retmtolr We, uclipapeR^' ’hints to iheiiiiietefe iseTiWi; ecnniarj nished Wl $ rhao, rhunf It is reported that aa organisation now exists numbering Caucasians, reisians and Turkomans, at Ashkabad, Dushakh, and Kahka, to facilitate the escape of prisoners of war to Persia and Afghanistan. Further enquiries will be made, but it is by no means improbable. 5C1. Military. The arrival of considerable numbers of recruits is reported. Ihe majority appear to be Tartars, and are very young and miserably clad pending the receipt of uniform. Some 400 remounts are reported to have reached Merv. Thirteen waggons of bridge material are standing at Kaghan for despatch to Termez. This is said to have been lying at Tashkent since the beginning of the war. ° ° JiQZ. Turkistan Musulmans .—From voluminous reports on this subject received, it would appear that two movements are at work among the Muham madan population of the country, which, as far as it is possible to judge at present, are at variance with each other. From reports of Musulman meetino-s held at Tashkent, Khokand. Samarkand, and Bokhara, a large section of the community are opposed to anything like Musulman autonomy in Turkistan. They are especially against power lapsing into the hands of the clergy. Their demands are mainly equal representation, and equal treatment with the Russian population. On the other side appears to be the pan-Turanian influence from the ■ Caucasus and in a paper &lt;e Freedom ” published in Turki at Samarkand are ■ given the proposed numbers of representatives per race in Turkistan, in line with the main organisation in the Caucasus. Beyond such open and above board proceedings intrigues beneath the surface appear to be at work. Dele gates from various cities and races have been sent both to the Amir of Bokhara and to Afghanistan, and it is rumoured that Turkish emissaries not long ago reached Bokhara, passing thence to Afghanistan. Incidentally two details reported from Herat appear to have some bearing on this question—the arrival at Herat of a Turkoman Sardar of the Akhal tribe from Khiva who is described as a man of some education. It is supposed that his object is Afghan assist- ' ance against the Russians, and his request has been forwarded to Kabul. The second instance is the appearance at Herat of a mysterious preacher who has attracted considerable attention, and whose theme is the union and co-ordinated action of all Musulmans. There can be little doubt that any Afghan action will have great influence on the natives of Turkistan. The movement for enlisting native guards for self-defence progresses. About 1,000 men are said to have been engaged at Askhabad, and 500 at Merv. This is also apparently in line with action in the Caucasus. E. A. F. REDLj Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staffs Officer.

Escaped prisoners .—An escaped Turkish non-commissioned officer named Ah who states that he belongs to the 101st Cavalry regiment, was captured^ at Trebizond, and escaped to Persia across the Caspian, has been detained in the town and brought to the Consulate-General. 565 Local Owing to his indisposition the Karguzar has appointed a temporary commission to administer &lt;he affairs of the province for him.

He has called certain t i. • . 8 ass i stan ce, and according to rumour Saiyid Ahmad Beg J amshadi has joined him. In any case it is quite possible that some Jamshadis not averse to a little plunder may have done so. Shaukat-ad-Daulah has been despatched to Meshed by Sayyid Haidar Bar ban. He has lost no time in borrowing funds with which to grease the palms of potential patrons. r Herat and Afghanistan. Germans and adherents.—Kazim Beg has heard the report of the capture of the Austrians and is somewhat cast-down thereby. He continues to _ inveigh at the British Agent at Herat, and both he and Nasrullah Khan are doing their best—without much success—to spread reports of allied reverses. 567. Military affairs.—A.t Darbar the Naib Salar stated that he had received a far man from Kabul authorising him to proceed with the raisino-I ’ 1 I ( 1 li| II, fI p Iff i of a 3rd Cavalry regiment. He impressed on chiefs of the khawavin the necessity of bringing recruits for the new formation, promising military promotion to successful recruiters. On being asked why he did not apply the 1 per 8 men conscription edict for this purpose he replied that he was reserving this measure for infantry and artillery recruits. The promotions of Fateh Muhammad Khan to General, and the appoint ments to Brigadiers for the 3 infantry brigades have been confirmed by farman from Kabul. One company of the Jadidi Herati Battalion has been despatched to Ghor, in relief of the detachment stationed there. The horses of the field batteries present at Herat were found to be in poor condition on inspection. Those responsible were punished and the drafting in of horses from stables in the districts is contemplated. Russian Turkistan. 567. Current events .—The chief stronghold of the maximalists is still Tashkent, although “ national qommissaries ” have now been elected at Askhabad. These are 7 in number and with the exception of one “ prapors- chik ” are either private soldiers or railway workmen. An Orenburg Cossack sotnya at Askhabad, unable to obtain forage for the horses or food for the men, applied to these worthies and were told that unless they adhered to the maxi malists they could starve. Facilities for returning to Orenburg were refused them. At Tashkent several newspapers were forcibly closed by the maximalists, The Turkistan News survived till the 4th instant, when a leading article, criti cising the action of the maximalists in excluding the Musulman population from any share in the government, stating that the musalmans were already against the usurpation of power by any political party, deprecating the alienation of 98 per cent, of the population (the Musulmans), and the intelli gent elements of the country by rule by force and demagogues, sealed its fate, and it was suppressed to appear ten days later as the organ of the national commissaries. In this number appeared a cynical announcement of the murder of the unfortunate General Kovovnichenko by soldiers guarding him in the Fortress at Tashkent, and although some regret at the act was subsequently expressed, and it was stated that those responsible would be tried, this carries little conviction. The trial of M„ Dorrer—late Commissioner of Transcaspia and Assistant Commissioner of Turkistan—began at Tashkent on the 16th instant before a revolutionary tribunal. Some idea of the maximalists methods may be gained by a report of their proceedings at Kaghan (New Bokhara), where armed maximalists interrupted a meeting of commercial]* sts and demanded an immediate “contribution” of a million rubles. Protests were met by the arrest of those present, and the victims subsequently agreed to pay up 200,000 rubles there and then, and the balance on demand later. The most important item of news this week is the decision arrived at by an extraordinary Musulman meeting at Khokand at which non-maximalist Russians were present on the 11th December. It was there decided to declare the auto nomy of Turkistan, and to appoint 54 representatives from the various provinces —of whom 36 should be Musulmans and the remainder Russians—to carry on affairs until a stable government could be appointed after the meeting of If 1 ® Constituent Assembly. For the time being an executive committee of Id members is to be elected, whose persons are declared to be sacrosanct, and any person doing violence to them to be liable to punishment by the 10 millions of the native population. This organisation was at once to enter into intimate relations with the S. E. Cossack Union, the Caucasian mountaineers, and the “ free races of the steppes,” with a view to concerted action. A nationa Turkistan fund to finance the organisation from the outset was inaugurate by voluntary subscription, and measures for the formation of a militia discusse . News of this definite action has only just reached Meshed, and it is as ye %impossible to say what its development, or effect on the maximalist aggression will be Semirechia announces adherence to the Provisional Goverament and re uses any communication with the maximalist authorities at Tashkent. in Ihe , 0runbu ^. and Caucasus grain stores may be closed to Turkistan n tne near future, and fear of famine is more than justified. furthe^service ^ 18 ' ° laSS haVe been released b y the maximalists from Meshed ; 2§th December 1917 J E.

For the present Meshed is without constituted authority, and the Karguzar will act in the interim. . 519 Deserters .—Two more Indian labour corps deserters have been sent in by the Agent at Sharifabad. These are (1) Muhammad Alam, resident of Bahaoli, Post Office Sarai Nauranga- bad, district Gujrat, confined at Gujranwala Jail and drafted to Mesopotamia. He deserted from Kut-al-Amarah. No. 1297 Saifal of 10th Coolie Corps. Village Dhr, Post Office Eujhan, district Ghazi Khan. Drafted to Mesopotamia from jail and deserted from Kut-al-Amarah. The above, with the two previously noted, will be despatched to Birjand in charge of a party of Hazara furlough men and recruits, the party having been provided with a request to all Cossack posts for assistance and protection where necessary en route- Herat and Afghanistan. 520. Germans and adherents Beg is still reported to be contemp lating flight but to be uncertain whether an attempt through Russia, in the present state of confusion, would not give him a better chance. I have requested the Officer Commanding, Russian troops, to warn the military authorities in Transcaspia of this possibility. He continues to tilt at the British Agent, but found the Naib-ul-Hukumah unsympathetic. Both he and Barakatullah have moved to the Bagh-i-Kartah. The Austrian “ Mirza ” was sent back to Herat, and will remain in charge in place of “ AH Khan ”. 521. Herat troops .—The boots recently received have been sufficient only for infantry and the “ 1st Artillery ” to whom they have been distributed. Tue Naib Salar is introducing various measures of internal discipline such as the presence in the lines every night of a certain proportion of officers, the presence of the men on parade some minutes before the bugle is sounded, etc. Orderly officers for visiting artillery sentries and lines have also been dexailed, as well as inspection by officers of the shoeing of horses. Russian Turkistan. 522. Current events .—The &lt;£ Askhabad ” of the 11th instant publishes an official appeal from the Commissary General of Turkistan stating that the maximalist movement in the capital is nearing its end and that the Provisional Government is victorious. He states that all organisations at Tashkent except the recent counter-revolutionary committee, who are in arrest awaiting trial, support the Provisional Government and that the unstable reserve regiments have been disarmed. He calls on all troops and citizens to maintain order, and adds that any rising will be ruthlessly repressed. This paper is the latest that has been received here, but on the 14th instant the Russian telegraph operator here heard from a colleague at Askhabad that fighting had been proceeding at Tashkent for several days and that half the town had been pillaged by maximalists. They had invited the garrisons of Kushk and Merv to join them. The former agreed to do so, but the Merv garrison not only refused but also declared their inten tion of preventing the passage of any troops from Kushk towards Tashkent. Telegraphic communication between Askhabad and Tashkent was interrupted. No confirmation, nor any further news has been received, and neither the Offi cer Commanding troops nor the Russian Consul-General here have later details. From papers received earlier in the week it is apparent that the discipline of the troops has been going from bad to worse. The 1st and 2nd Siberian Rifle Reserve Regiments refused to turn out to drill, or to carry out any mili tary order not sanctioned by the Workmen and Soldiers’ Committee, and their officers have no sort of authority over them. On the other hand the discipline of the Cossacks is said to be exemplary. Against this, however, must be held the fact that 73 Cossacks of the 17th Orenburg Regiment are in confinement at Tashkent awaiting trial for refusing on the 31st October to saddle up in readi ness to repress maximalist disorders. A^ Two recent sentences by Court-Martial at Tashkent will give the measure of the length to which the local military authorities venture to go. (a) Three soldiers arrested at Tashkent and convicted of desertion from the front line in the face of the enemy. Sentence—4 weeks in the quarter-guard on bread and water. (b) Non-Commissioned Officers convicted of deliberately releasing from the quarter-guard two soldier prisoners committed to his charge. Sentence—5 weeks in the quarter-guard on bread and water. Musulman Committees at Tashkent have passed resolutions of fidelity to the Provisional Government, and as far as it is possible to judge, their demean our up to the present has been moderate and correct. Unrest is reported from Astrabad among the Turkoman in the Chikishliyar region who, inter alia, are continually causing serious interruptions to the telegraph line. A large smuggling caravan, although fired upon by Cossacks, succeeded in getting through into Persia. Absolute anarchy appears to obtain in Eussian Sarakhs, persons being plundered with impunity in broad day-light. Great insecurity to travellers is reported along the Central Asian Railway w r here native and other miscreants, wearing a red band on the arm, under the pretext of searching passengers’ baggage, rob them freely. The Amir of Bokh ara is said to have been requested by the Russians to maintain order at railway stations in his dominions but to have disclaimed the responsibility. E. A. E. REEL, Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staff Officer. Meshed : 17th November 1917.— — The Eussians arrested an Austrian in the town on the 22nd instant. 525. Local affairs. —The Karguzar continues to act pending a settlement to the Governor-General. The Jam district remains unsettled, and there are rumours of hostilities between opposing factions. Shajji-as-Saltanah, being unable to maintain himself, has returned to Meshed, and for the present there is no question of any effective action on his behalf. Herat and Afghanistan. 526. Germans and adherents. —Kazim Beg has applied to the Naib Salar for a guide acquainted with Persian routes, and there is a probability of his shortly taking the road accompanied by the Austrians Gruden and Dimitrovich. Bara- katuilah, being in weak health, is apparently to remain in charge of the baggage left behind. Both the guard and the savars posted at the Bagh-i- Kartah have been considerably reduced in number. 527- Rerat troops. —By the JNaib Salar’s orders magazine rifles and equipment have been issued to the Khaki and Ghaznichi battalions, their old rifles and equipment being returned to store. The Naib Salar subsequently photographed these units as well as a mountain and a field battery. The following promotions, sanctioned from Kabul, were announced by the Naib Salar at Durbar :— Brigadier Pateh Muhammad Khan to be General. Colonel Abdul Bauf Khan of the Ghaznichi Battalion to be Brigadier and to command the 1st Brigade. Colonel Ata Muhammad of the 3rd Herati Battalion to be Brigadier and to command the 2nd Brigade. Colonel Saifullah Khan of the Jadidi Kabuli Battalion to be Brigadier and to command the 3rd Brigade. Kazim Beg subsequently congratulated these officers, making flattering remarks as to the abilities of the Naib Salar. A company of the 3rd Herati Infantry has been sent to Chakcharan to relieve the local garrison. This is apparently the first step towards bringing the khasadars —10th Herati Battalion—to Herat for training. Units of the garrison are to be trained in encamping practice. The Naib Salar has again made remarks regarding the proximate entry of Afghanistan into the war. Russian Turkistan. 528. Current events. —The situation at Tashkent is curiously obscure Askhabad itself even, according to telegraphic conversations from here, being much in the dark as to what is actually happening, and being dependent on private information. Both telegraphic and railway communication with Tashkent were at a standstill for several days but were resumed early in the week. Issues of the “Askhabad” received early in the week stated that fighting had begun between the Siberian Eeserve Eegiments helped by railway workmen on the one side and representatives of the Provisional Government with such troops as were loyal on the other. Both sides had guns and machine guns. Considerable loss of life and material damage were reported. For some time neither side appeared to have gained the advantage, but the issue of the “ Askhabad ” of the 17th instant contains a Tashkent telegram dated the 15th instant which states that the civil war at Tashkent is at an end. The Turkistan Council has undertaken the restoration of order in the town and has assumed the government, relying on all classes of the population. Korovnich- enko and Dorrer have been arrested and members of the Executive Committee and Turkistan Council released. All is now quiet in the town and railway traffic has been renewed. Whether this is the last word remains to be seen. From the wording of the message and the fact that the Commissary-General and his assistant have been arrested, it may be assumed that the party in power now represent the maximalists, but the Eussians themselves here do not know what this actually implies.1 SECRET.

My patrol was obliged to wait in the street till 10 p m. while a fiuitless search for the village headman and for lodgings proceeded. There were lights m many houses but no answer was given to knock or summons. It was necessary to break in the door of the headman’s house; after which owners of other houses made their ^pearance.

In view of the fruitlessness of a further stay in the village, and of the danger of further cholera infection to the Cossacks—the, village was in the throes of a cholera epidemic—without any medical personnel on the spot, I decided to return. The Consular Agent at Turshiz, far from assisting me in my dealings with the Governor, took his side in all discussions. It is rumoured that he has participated in the division of «the Germans’ money and arms, and a 3 -line rifle of Cossack pattern was seen in his house by my interpreter. This, after much prevarication and a threat to search his house, he eventually produced.” Dated the 15th November 1917. E. A. F. KEDL, Lieut.-Colonel^ General Staff Officer.

He supplied them with forage and food, informed them that the surroundings were unsafe on account “of robbers and they determined to spend the day in the garden. Quite possibly the agent sent for the Persian man; at any rate a few hours afterwards, Wagner fired 3 alarm shots on seeing surars approaching. The party at first meditated flight b * on dndm S tllat tj 16 garden was surrounded they began to return the fire of the Persians. Feldwebel Bayerl was killed by a bullet in the head at an early stage and M agner then sent one of his Persians to explain to the assailants that they were harmless travellers and not Turkoman robbers Firing continued for some time, however; Naka had his arm splintered by a bullet and a horse was killed.

Semirecma has also declared its independence, announcing that for the present all authority is vested in Cossack military organisations who are loyal to the Provisional Government. On the other hand soldiers in Turkistan are m general sympathy with the maximalists, and further conflicts between soldiers and cossacks are not unlikely. Erom latest accounts the fighting at Tashkent was very runequal, Genera Korovnichenko having at his disposal some 2,000 only, consisting of cossacks yunkers, cadets, and seminarists. The forces of disorders amounted to some 10 000. The artillery later throw in their lot with them, whereas the majority of the guns in the hands of the loyalists had had their breech blocks removed. The two armoured cars on the loyalist side were put out of action, and the extremists, who were being continually reinforced, compelled, the surrender of the Government party. Many excesses are reported, and the casualties on the extremist side were placed by the newspapers at^ 400 killed and l,uuu wounded, and on the other side not much less. This is probably exaggerated, as 79 nersons killed on the extremist side were buried with much pomp at Tashkent. Material damage has also evidently been considerably exaggerated. The whole affair appears to have been very much a contest of class against class, and as such arouses anxiety throughout Turkistan. Native casualties are reported, although the natives apparently took no part m the ughtmg. They are said to be very apprehensive at Askhabad and to have arranged Turkoman protection, the latter being in search of arms for the purpose. There are P said to be 1,400 Cossacks (800 Orenburg and 600 Semirechia) m 'arrison at Samarkand where there are about 2,500 infantry. At Askhabad there are only about 350 Cossacks and 2,200 infantry, as well as 150 Frontier Guard. The Cossacks, however, are armed with magazine rifles and the infantry have practically nothing better than the Beraan. The training and discipline of the Cossacks is also considerably superior so that they may be expected to hold their own should it come to fightm 0 any place in which they are not hopelessly outnumbered. E. A. F. REDL, Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staff Officer. Mbshed : 1st December 1917. !SECRET. 'JO. fy 18 JAM 1913 | 1 SviAK'1918-i * MEMORANDUM. : l TO THE SENIOR GENERAL STATE OEEICER, M. 0. 3. No. 5-S. On the 28th and 29th instant I have been interrogating the Austrian prisoners and hope to forward their detailed statements (taken down in Russian) next week. The main features of their story are given in this week’s Intelligence Summary. Such particulars as bore on the escape of Captain Wagner were immediately communicated to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General who at once despatched necessary telegrams. Colonel Meshetich, commanding Persian Cossacks here, has also promised me to inform the Officer Commanding Persian Cossack Brigade, Tehran, and there is still hope that Wagner may be intercepted. As all 3 prisoners were members of the original Niedermeyer expedition, I am strongly of the opinion that they should be sent to India where Jandl in particular should be capable of giving useful information regarding the incep tion of the mission. He is the most intelligent of the three, I asked Colonel Gustchin yesterday what he considered under the present circumstances the most suitable way of disposing of the men, and he at once replied that in his opinion they should Ee sent to India. 2 . The following particulars may be of interest : (а) Papers .—The men state that all papers of importance have been sent to Germany. Niedermeyer himself took some sketches that he had made, and von Hentig was entrusted with important documents, bearing, I imagine, on such agreement as had been reached with the Afghan Government at the time of the Germans’ departure from Kabul. They state that on this occasion they had no papers with them and deny that there is anything of importance at Herat. Jandl states that no regular survey work was carried out by the party. I am not convinced of the truth of these statements and have at present a man in the Turshiz neighbourhood searching for such papers as may have fallen into Persian hands, and our efforts in other directions have not been relaxed. The address “ Tupfer ” on the cypher document intercepted last year signified “ Niedermeyer, ” “ K. Hein” was Wagner. ( б ) Abdurrahman Khan of whom frequent recent mencion has been made in Meshed Diaries and Intelligence Summaries is a Baghdadi Turk or Arab, who brought letters from Baghdad travelling via Tehran. He stayed for some 3 or 4 weeks at Herat, and again returned to Baghdad via Tehran. The German party had had no previous acquaintance with him. (c) Sidiq Hassan Beg is a Turkish yuzbashi and a prisoner of war who escaped from Siberia. (d) The statement of Abdul Wahab regarding his departure from Afghan istan with Ali i^kbar alias Mirza Hussain is said to be untrue. Abdul Wahab joined the Germans near Tun, but proved a useful man as he knew Turkoman and a little Russian. He actually, with one Turkoman guide, accompanied Niedermeyer from near Balkh probably as far as Meshed. Niedermeyer had formed the intention of crossing the Kara Kum desert. The prisoners do not know how far he made his way into Russia but they heard of his safe arrival at Meshed. They say he proceeded from Meshed to Tehran by post-waggon in Persian disguise. I personally doubt his having taken the waggon from Meshed itself especially in view of General Loginov’s strict orders issued about that time. It is quite probable, however, that he utilised the post further on the road. Ali Akbar was one of Wagner’s original savars, scattered near Kain by the Russians. He rejoined the German party, but according to the prisoners returned to Persia from Herat.Ahmad Barbari, on returning from Meshed to Herat, reported Abdul Wahab’s presence at Meshed. As he was in straits for money Wagner sent him £10 by Sayyid Hussain, who was intercepted. The prisoners know nothing of the passports which Abdul Wahab was asked to obtain. (&lt;?) The young German “ Ott,” whose despatch to Kabul Wagner was anxious to prevent is a German youth named Otto Sperling, who before the war resided in the Caucasus with his parents. He was due for internment on reaching the age of 18, but escaped to Turkistan and thence to Afghanistan meaning to reach China. if ) Purey Khan alias Ibrahim Khan is an Afridi chai'vadar who took service with the Germans at Herat. He came from Persia. The prisoners say he has 2 brothers serving in the Indian army, but do not know whether he was himself a soldier. E. A. E.

J. mAK 1910 ^ INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY NUMBER 49 FOR THE WEEK ENDING THE 8TH DECEMBER 1917. Khorasan and North=East Persia. 537. Russian force .—The 1st Secretary of the Russian Consulate-General with a small detachment of Cossacks proceeded to Chinaran to investigate the murder of the Cossack noted in paragraph 523. The gang of robbers responsible for the outrage was engaged and three of them were killed, one being by report the actual murderer. Some prisoners also were brought in. It transpired that the robbers had long had designs on a rich village in the vicinity, but that the villagers were well-armed and determined. By killing a^ Cossack near the village the robbers hoped to ensure the disarmament of the villagers by the Cossacks (besides being a rifle to the good), and to have the village at their mercy subsequently. 538. Austrian prisoners .—On re-questioning the Austrians explain the fact that on the occasion of their flight from Said-ud-Din they had rifles with them by saying that they were able, on the evening of their flight, to take their rifles back from another room during the temporary absence of the Persians. The statements of two of them are at variance as to the number of rifles with them ; the third denied that they had any rifles at all when they fled. They persist in stating that no connivance existed between themselves and the Persians, and maintain that their flight was a bond fide one. The only papers found on them by the Russians were a “ General guts- chein ” or order for payment to the head-muleteer Abbas Ali Isfahani “ at any German Consulate in Persia or at Baghdad, or at the German Legation at Tehran ” of tomans 380 and £15 sterling signed by Wagner and dated the 24th October, and a letter dated 1915 from Dimitrovich to his mother saying that he was in Afghanistan and in good health. He is a corporal in the 33rd Austrian Infantry Regiment. An acute agent whom I despatched to Turshiz to search for papers has just returned stating that no papers whatsoever were in Persian hands except a few cuttings from illustrated papers which the Austrians had given to villagers, and which he brought back. He stayed for some days with Mir Zabi Khan and tells the following story. On the arrival of the German party at his garden, the Russian agent scented a profitable transaction. While supplying the Germans with provisions, etc., he sent his son off to Said-ud-Din to Mir Zabi Khan, describing the party and their armament and telling him to send 30 savars to take them. The fight ensued as described and the prisoners were taken to Said-ud-Din. When the Russian force arrived the prisoners had been secreted in another house; the Russians were shewn the room in which they had been confined with the breach in the w all; Mir Zabi w r as absent “ in pursuit ”. Owing to the cholera and tacit obstruction the Russians did not stay long. On subsequent discussion Mir Zabi decided that he would have to produce some prisoners, and it was agreed that the Austrians should be given up and Wagner taken off. He was taken to a secure hiding place in the hills to lie low till all search should be at an end, and Mir Zabi sent in to Turbat saying that he had recaptured the Austrians. Mir Zabi and his friends have taken all the cash and arms, hut will probably escort Wagner on a promise of further reward. The action of the Russian agent was motived by no loyalty to the Russians (whom according to Captain Jansen’s report he did his utmost to obstruct), but purely by the hope of sharing in the spoil. It may be possible to obtain admissions from the prisoners to confirm this aspect of the case which is hy no means an impossible one. If true it would not necessarily affect Wagner’s chances of escape, provided that a look-out be maintained at possible exits towards Tehran, or on roads from Tabas. 539. Escaped prisoners .—Early in the week we were able to lay hands on the Turk at the Karguzari when he had come out into the street. He was very■0P poorly fed there and by no means unwilling to be taken over. The Austrian (paragraph 524-) taken by the Cossacks had previously denied having been in the Karsuzari, but the Turk in question (Shawish Abdullah Salih Oghli of the 9th Turkish Hussar Regiment) identified him as the man who had been for some days in the Karguzari with him, and who had gone out one day and not returned Under the circumstances the Karguzar appears to have deviated somewhat from the truth when he assured the Russian Consul-General that neither Turk nor Austrian were or had been in the Karguzari. Abdullah Salih escaped from Tashkent where, he says, there are 7,000 Austrian and 5,000 German prisoners. There is to all intents and purposes no supervison over them. Although without a passport the Frontier Guard on the Kahka frontier turned him loose into Persia after stripping him of a considerable sum in cash which he carried on his person. On the railway iourney in lurkistan no one interfered with him except one Russian soldier who good-naturedly exclaimed “ Oh well, this is a time of freedom for all.” The Khushbegi at Bokhara urged him to remain there in safety. Another Turk, belonging to the same regiment, voluntarily surrendered at the Consulate-General some days before. He had remained at Hamadan when the Turks retreated. 510. Local affairs .—The Barbaris in the Jam District have inflicted a considerable reverse on the Taimuris, who have suffered from 30 to 50 casual ties. Shaukat-ad-Daula, the Ilbaigi, and Mir Baqi Sultan have fled in different directions. The Persian Government was asked by Haj ji Hussain Agha and his friends to despatch a force to punish the Barbaris, in point of fact for coming to the assistance of the Government representative sent with Shajji-as-Saltanah when called upon by him, and had actually issued orders for its despatch. It appears probable now that the order will be countermanded. An agent at Langar reports that the Barbaris number about 1,500 men and among others have some 600 magazine rifles, although they are short of ammunition. Beyond eating up the villages through which they would pass, a force of some hundreds of Persian “ regulars ” would not be very likely to accomplish much. Herat and Afghanistan. 5411. Germans and adherents .—Kazim Beg continues to quarrel with the Austrians, and appears to have thoroughly disgusted the Naib-ul-Hukumah, and in a lesser degree the Naib Salar. 5412. Militai'y affairs .—The cavalry are being paid up previous to moving in relief of frontier detachments. The Naib Salar has inspected the cavalry and made 21 promotions to non-commissioned rank. He withheld, however, the pay of all Kote Dafadars as they were insufficiently posted in duties in the field till such time as they attain proficiency. Practice marches w ith camp equipment are to be undertaken by the garrison. 5413. Mazar-i-Sharif .—Arrivals here report that magazine rifles have been issued to the troops at Mazar-i-Sharif and Maimana. Old rifles and equip ment from the latter place have been despatched to Mazar for storage. Russian Turkistan. 544. Current affairs .—Except that the boycott against Tashkent under its present self-constituted authorities has increased in volume little news of Turkistan is to hand. Apparently no communications postal or telegraphic pass between Tashkent and other towns, as the maximalists having arrested employes of these departments their comrades elsewhere refuse to communicate with Tashkent. No newspapers at all have been received from Tashkent this week and those from Askhabad contain little but padding. A recent letter from a correspondent at Tashkent confirms generally the account already given of the fighting there. The Cossacks of the 4 Issetski Orenburg Regiment, 1,100 strong, were about the only regular troops on the Government side and they were at length obliged to^take refuge in the nativecity. My informant states that about 600 troops from Kushk with machine guns and 1,500 from Samarkand—apparently the 731st militia—arrived to help the maximalists and guarded the approaches to Tashkent during the fighting. The Siberian Eeserve Eegiments reinforced by the workmen totalled about 8,000, and in addition many soldiers’ wives swelled the forces of disorder. He puts the casualties on the maximalist side at 2,600 and on that of the Government at 450. The Cossacks had magazine against their opponents single-loading rifles. The Cossacks have now been disarmed but the maxima lists were still apprehensive of attack by Cossacks from Orenburg. A sub-lieutenant (praporstchik) now commands the Tashkent troops with a Lieutenant-Colonel as his assistant. Since the beginning of the disorders the Officer Commanding Russian troops here has not received a single letter or telegram from Tashkent, and from Samarkand he receives communications of a purely routine nature. Anarchy continues around Merv where robberies and murders are fre quent. 1,000 of the 6th Siberian Reserve Regiment are at Merv, and 1,000 of the same unit with some 200 Semirechia Cossacks at Kaghan. There seems to be little doubt that fear of the Turkoman restrained soldiers at Askhabad from excesses, and it is reported that native residents have onenly stated that they will call in Turkoman assistance in the event of any disorders which threaten their lives and property. The vicinity of both Persian and Russian Sarakhs continue unsafe, and this condition of affairs is now reflected on North-East Khorasan roads generally. E. A. E. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel, General Staff Officer. Meshed : 8th December 1917.S ECRET. ^ MEMORANDUM. To the SENIOR GENERAL STAEE OFFICER, M. 0, 3. No. 6-S. f(l) -Detailed statements of the Austrian prisoners. I beg to forward«{ (2) Statement of the Turkish sergeant arrested here L during the week. . 1 propose to question the Austrians again to-day in the light of the infor mation from my agent which has just reached me. At the present juncture it is unnecessary to enlarge on the subject, hut I have had suspicions that an arrangement to permit, the head of the party to go free may have been made, and the statements of the prisoners regarding the arms reveal discrepancies which’ might very well occur in a carefully pre-arranged story when questioned on a point which had hitherto escaped attention. It is also unlikely that Persians would voluntarily surrender a large sum in cash, already in their hands, while prisoners whom they intend to keep securely are often tied up and guarded bv a sentry. The story of the escape as told by the Austrians may be true but is, I think, unlikely. Rifles in Persian eyes are worth their weight in cold and would hardly have been disposed of so carelessly as was stated bv° the Austrians. ^ I enclose the illustrations recovered. They may be taken to shew sympathy with Musulman religious feelings. The short statement of the Turk is of interest as regards the number and treatment of prisoners of war at Tashkent, the deplorable laxness and dis honesty of Russian frontier guards, the demeanour of Bokharan officials regard ing Musulman prisoners, and the duplicity of the Karguzar.

M 18 JAG 1918 ' 1 KAR '1918 jA* Statement of Corporal Heinrich Jandl, 27th Austrian Infantry Hegiment. {Taken over by Tussian patrol at Said-ud-Din, November 1917.) I am a wireless telegraphist and was detached to Constantinople in 1914 for duty there. When Captain Niedermeyer arrived in the spring of 1915 I was ordered ro accompany him to Persia. The following party left for Aleppo Captain Niedermeyer, Lieutenant Voigt. (Sergeant Jakob, Krause, Dimitrivich and myself. At Aleppo we found Captain Wagner, von Hentig, l)r. .Becker, Dr. Niedermeyer, Valter, Eohrer, Kazim Beg, the Indian Itajah, Moulvi Barakatullah, and some 12 Indian non-commissioned officers and men. We all travelled together to Kermanshah where we met the brothers Paschen, Prince Beuss—-the German Minister—and Count Logotheti, the Austrian Consul. There were also some others whose names I cannot recall. Most of these persons left for Tehran. We were some days at Kermanshah, after which the diplomatic officials and Niedermeyer proceeded direct to Tehran, and I accompanied Wagner and Paschen to Isfahan. There we found Pasting in charge of the wireless station, assisted by an Austrian whose name I do not recall. I joined them for the time. I was about 1J months at Isfahan : I then proceeded to Tehran for a fortnight and on returning passed some 16 days at Isfahan before we left. Soon after I first reached Isfahan a party of some 25 escaped Austrian prisoners arrived there The first to leave Isfahan towards Afghanistan were Paschen and Wagner. With the second party were von Hentig, Rohrer, Kazim Beg, the Rajah, and Barakatullah. Both these parties proceeded to Tabas. The third party consisted of Dr. Becker with 3 Indian soldiers. 'With the 4th party were Jakob, Wedig—an attendant of Prince Reuss—Sergeant Bayerl, Krause, Dimitrovich and Josef. The 5th party consisted of Niedermeyer, Voigt, Makhnik, Gregorovich, Paiung (Austrian soldiers) and myself. 'We overtook the 4th party at Anarak and joined them. Becker’s party we overtook at Chahardeh near Tabas. We proceeded together to Bushruyeh, but one stage before reaching that place Dr. Becker returned to Tabas. Before reaching Bushruyeh we joined von Hentig’s party. We remained 12 days at Bushruyeh, and while there heard of the attack on Wagner and Paschen’s party at Kain. These two officers abandoned their baggage and returned to Bushruj eh. We then together crossed the desert to Tun, but one stage short of that place turned off to Duhuk, and reached Afghanistan by the Yezdan road. At Herat we passed about 3 weeks, Paschen returning to Persia. The main party with Niedermeyer proceeded to Kabul, only Bayerl and Krause remaining at Herat. Sergeant Jakob died on the way to Kabul. There had been an intention of sending the wireless station from Isfahan on to Kabul, but it w r as never realised. We were some 8 months at Kabul. Our chiefs were carrying on negotiations with the Afghan Government. I am unable to say exactly what occurred, but it was said that Afghanistan was unfit for war, that the Amir and the principal officials were under English influence, and that there was no chance of success for us. Niedermeyer then asked for permission to depart. The first party to leave Kabul on the 21st June 1916 were Neidermeyer, von Hentig, Rohrer, Gruden, Wagner, Dimitrovich, Erantz and myself. We left for Mazar-i-Sharif, but on the way Hentig and Rohrer (Reyer) left us for the Chinese frontier, taking Josef with them. One stage after leaving Balkh, Niedermeyer, with Abdul Wahab and a Turkoman guide procured by Abdul Wahab, also left us. His intention was to cross the Kara Kum desert, but I cannot say how far he penetrated into Russia. We sub sequently heard that he had passed Meshed in safety—I think at the end of July or early in August—and had proceeded to Tehran in Persian disguise in a post-waggon. Voigt and 2 Indians constituted the 2nd party. They met Bayerl and Krause * at Ghazni, and all returned together towards Kandahar. Bayerl and Krause reached Herat some days after us. Our long stay at Herat became un bearable to us as we had nothing to do. We received and sent on several occa sions letters by Persian or chance messengers. At last it was decided we should leave which we did on the *2 7th October of this year, making the pretext of a hunting expedition. We had a mounted Afghan escort, avoided all * Certain discrepancies re Krause and Gruden may be noted.» X inhabited places and slept out in the open. We passed the Afghan frontier on the SOih October, exactly where I cannot say as we marched by by-ways We passed the day of the 31st October at Khaf, leaving in the evening, and passed Turbat-i-Baidari, a few miles to the North of us, during the r night of the 1st 2nd November. We halted near a village before Tarshiz but passed Turshiz itself by nigiit, and when making for the village of Kundur on the night of the 3rd-4th November lost our way and reached a garden about mid-night where we bivouacked. The following morning we saw the Russian agent in the garden, recognizing him by the badge on his cap. Our guide told him that we were Turkomans (we had adopted Turkoman dress) and he sold us food and forage. Some hours later Wagner, who w r as outside the * garden, fired 3 alarm shots. We seized our rifles and looked for the enemy. At that moment a fusilade began : Bayerl was killed by a shot in the head. At first we returned the fire but Wagner told us to cease firing and sent the guide to tell the Persians that we Tvere not robbers. The Persians, however, continued to fire; the Persian Kaka was wounded and a horse was killed At last they ceased firing and called to us to leave our arms in the garden and to come out, which we did. They refused to release us pending orders from the Governor of Turshiz, took us to Kundur for the night and the following day to Said-ud- l)in where we were confined in a room. On the 6th night after our arrival there we escaped by breaking through the wall, found our horses in the court yard (our saddles had been in the room with us), and escaped towards Tabas. On the 3rd day one horse broke down, and we observed Persians in pursuit. We sent Wagner off accompanied by Ghulam Raza who had a good brown horse, and ourselves scattered in different directions to distract the pursuers. We 3 Austrians and the Persian Hussain were captured, but no more was seen of Wagner. He had a good grey Arab horse, 2 Mauser carbines, 2 pistols, and at least 500 tomans in Persian currency, English and Russian gold with him. Me had had from700 to 800 tomans including£50 sterling, besides 200 rubles in Russian gold. The Persians took 4 rifles and 120 tomans only from us. We had no papers with us nor did we leave any of importance at Herat. Niedermeyer took sketches of Afghanistan which he had made with him and von Hen tig had other important documents. I think that W agner will try to reach Aleppo by the line Kashan-Ker- manshah which was the route we originally intended to follow. Ho will avoid inhabited places as far as possible. He had obtained Persian clothes at Said- ud-Din which he wore with a high felt kullah. Underneath he wore a grey coat and light brown trowsers. Of the 4 Persians with us Abbas Ali remained sick between Khaf and Turbat-i-Haidari, Kaka wounded at Said-ud-Din, Hussain was captured, and Ghulam Raza accompanied Warner. B.—Statement of Brivate Michael Krause of the 2nd Ronveg Infantry Regi ment. {Taken over by Russian patrol at Said-ud-Din, November 1917.) I am a field telegraphist and was detached to Constantinople in 1914. In the spring of 1915 I was ordered to accompany Captain Niedermeyer, together with Jandl, to Persia and Afghanistan, and remained with them the whole way to Kabul. When the German Mission left Kabul in 1916 I received orders to accompany Lieutenant Voigt and 2 Indians to Kandahar. M e met Bayerl and Gruden at Ghazni, and they turned back with us. After leaving Kandahar, and 2 stages before reaching Sabzwar, Voigt and the Indians turned off towards Persia. Bayerl, Gruden, and I with 12 ba-gage- mules proceeded to Herat where we found Captain Wagner, Jandl, Frantz, and Dimitrovich. On the 27th October of this year by Wagner’s orders we left Herat for home. We were to make for Tabas, but I do not know the route intended after that. The party consistedt)f Wagner, Bayerl, Jandl, Erantz and myself. (Gruden started with us but returned to Herat from the Afghan frontier, and the head muleteer Abhas AH fell sick after leaving Khaf.) 3 Persians accompanied us all through— Ghulam Baza, Kaka and Hussain. 10 Afghan savars accompanied us as far as the Afghan frontier. We wore Turkoman dress with khaki underneath. We passed the day of the 30th October at Khaf, proceeded towards Turbat-i- Haidari, a few miles to the south of which we passed by night. We passed Turshiz by night (2nd-3rd November), spent the following day in the hills, and after losing our w r ay to Kundur reached a garden, during the night of the 3rd-4th November, where we halted. It was in this garden, which belonged to the Bussian agent, that the fight occurred the next morning with Persian savars in which Payerl was killed by my side, Kaka w T ounded, and a horse killed. We were taken to Kundur for the night by the Persians; thence the following day to Said-ud-Din. We escaped the 6th night of our confinement there. Kaka remained there. We made for Tabas, but on the 3rd day of our flight a horse broke down and we saw Per sians in pursuit. We scattered, and all except Wagner and Ghulam Baza were recaptured and taken to Said-ud-Din. Wagner had a good grey Arab. On the baggage mule were carried only cooking vessels and stores for the road. We had no papers with us and as far as I know not much money. Our arms were : 3 Bussian rifles, 1 French rifle, 2 Mauser carbines, 1 Mauser pistol and 1 para bellum pistol. The Persians took these arms as also 120 tomans in cash. The agent, I know, had the French rifle. I cannot say whether he sent for the Persian savars who captured us, but I think it probable. Bayerl had no gold wrist watch as the agent stated, and I do not think that eren Wagner had one. BayerPs was an ordinary nickel pocket watch. O .—Statement of Private Edward Frantz of the 3rd Battalion, Fortress Artillery. {Taken over by Pussian patrol at Said-ud-Din, November 1917.) I was detached to Constantinople in 1914 as cook to other men of my battalion and the following spring was detailed to accompany von Hentig to Aleppo and Tehran as his cook. We stayed at the German Consulate at Tehran going thence direct to Tabas without visiting Isfahan. Yon Hentig had with him Kazim Beg, the Indian Bajah, Moulvi Barakatullah and some 12 Indian soldiers. We joined Niedermeyer before reaching Bushruyeh, and thence on travelled in company. We saw no Bussians between Bushruyeh and the Afghan frontier, but heard of the attack on Wagner and Paschen, and the loss of their baggage. We were 2 or 3 weeks at Herat before starting for Kabul. Bayerl, who was a telephonist, and Krause were left at Herat. I have no idea what occurred during the 8 months we spent at Kabul, as I was busied with my duties as cook. We left for Mazar-i-Sharif and soon after starting von Hentig left us. On proceeding further Niedermeyer also left us after we had passed Balkh. He proceeded towards Bussia. Of his subsequent movements I only know that he passed through Meshed and eventually reached Tehran in a post waggom Wagner and four of us Austrian soldiers finally arrived at Herat-Jandl, Dimitrovich, Gruden-—an “ einjahriger ” of good education—and myself. Bayerl and Krause subsequently arrived as also Kazim Beg and Barakatullah. Ihere was nothing for us to do at Herat and Wagner ordered us to leave for Persia. We knew, of course, that the journey would be risky. We marched for 3 days in Afghanistan and 5 in Persia, reaching at last a garden a few miles from Kundur where we passed the night. In the morning we saw the Bussian agent, whom we recognized by the badge on his cap. One of our Persians talked with him and he warned us that there was danger irom robbers in% the neighbourhood, advised us to remain for the day in his garden, and sup plied us with provisions. After some hours there Wagner suddenly fired 3 alarm shots. We saw Persian savars near the garden, and were preparing for flight when we found that the garden was surrounded. The Persians opened fire^on us to which we replied. Firing must have lasted for about an hour. Bayerl was killed by a shot in the head. We tried without success to convince the Persians that we were not robbers, but they continued firing and a Persian servant was wounded and a horse killed. When at last they ceased firino- we laid down our arms in the garden and came out. Having taken possession of our baggage the Persians eventually took us to Said-ud-Din where we remained several nays. To all our requests to be allowed to proceed they returned evasive answers, and seeing that the matter was hopeless we determined to escape. We broke the wall, found our horses, and leaving the wounded Persian behind, made for Tabas. Finding ourselves pursued on the 3rd day we scattered to give Captain Wagner a chance. All of us, except him and Ghulam Raza, were recaptured and returned to Said-ud-Din. Taken before me. Meshed ; 28th and 29th November 1917. E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel, General Staff Officer. (Reference Intelligence Summary No. 48.) Note. The statements that all the rifles with the German party were taken over by the Persians after the fight in the garden, and that Wagner, in his sub sequent escape had 2 Mauser carbines and 2 pistols with him appear to require explanation. I therefore again questioned the prisoners on the subject and their replies were as follows. (They were questioned separately.) (a) Jandl. —We escaped in the night. Late in the afternoon we noticed that the Persians in the adjoining room had all left it and were absent some time. W e entered the room and found our 5 rifles, which, with some cartridges, we were able to carry into our own room, and hide under our effects. The Persians did not notice the absence of the arms before the escape. M hen we were recaptureed the 3 Russian rifles were re-taken with us but Wagner had made off with the 2 Mausers. All our rifles had been taken from us after the fight in the garden. {b) Frantz. —All our rifles were taken from us in the garden, and we never got them back. Wagner had a Mauser pistol when he escaped which he had worn concealed under his clothes. (&lt;?) Krause. —The Persians took possession of all our rifles after the fight in the garden. On the afternoon of our escape we found 2 Mauser rifles in the room adjoining our own, and took them into our room. The Persians did not notice their absence and we took them with us. Asked how he accounted for the discrepancies in the above statements. Jandl said that when they escaped they found the baggage mule with their hoises and took it with them. The 3 Russian rifles were loaded on the mule and it was possible that his companions did not notice this. All declared that they escaped without Persian connivance, and that no arrangement was entered into with Mir Zabi Khan to let Wagner go free, to produce the Austrians as a proof of his zeal. £They state that the wall was so thin that they were able to take out the bricks noiselessly without arousing the Persians who were sleeping in other parts of the building. There was a guard at the front of the building, but none at the stable side where they escaped. 2. With reference to the statement of the Russian agent that the European buried in his garden had a Cross tattooed on his arm, Jandl was asked if any of the party had a cross tattooed on his person. He replied that none of them had but that Bayerl had very noticeable vaccination marks on the upper arm which were in the form of a cross. E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel, General Staff Officer. Statement of Sergeant Abdullah Salih Oghli of 9th Turkish Hussar Regiment (arrested at Meshed on 1st December 1917). I was captured by the Russians with a section of my regiment at Erzerum in 1916, and some 25 of us were taken to Tashkent. We were quartered in barracks built by ourselves, and up to the Russian revolution there was some supervision over us, a couple of Russian soldiers sleeping in each room. After the revolution supervision practically ceased and we were able to wander at will in the streets. The total number of prisoners at Tashkent is about 12,000—7,000 Austrians and 5,000 Germans. There were about 100 Bosnians and Herzegovini ans. I received in all about 2,000 rubles from my home and at the time of my flight from Tashkent about 2 months ago had 800 rubles and £100 in English gold. The bread ration being reduced to j lb, per day I resolved to escape, and took a ticket from Tashkent for Askhabad. I stopped 2 days at Bokhara, the Khushbegi giving me a small quarter in the palace precincts and advising me to stay there where I should be in perfect safety. I continued my journey, however, to Askhahad without being interfered with in any way, but found that Kahka would be more favourable to cross into Persia. I returned by rail to Kahka, hired a horse and left for the frontier. There the Frontier Guards asked for my passport I replied that I was without one. They stated that this did not matter and asked for my money. They took all I had—practically the sum stated above,—and turned me loose into Persia. I made my way on foot to Meshed where I stayed for a few days at a tea-house. A policemen guided me to the Karguzari, warning me to be very careful not to be arrested by the British or Russian Consulate. I was quartered in the stable and received a small portion of bread daily from the grooms for 17 days. I did not see the Karguzar, nor can I say whether he was aware of my presence there. For several days an Austrian was there also. He had, I know, spoken with the Karguzar and was there with his permission. He went out one day and did not return. I am a Bosnian by birth and 21 years old. I was educated at Constan tinople at the German school, served 3 years in military telegraphs, and 3 years in my regiment before I was taken prisoner. I have been in Berlin and speak German, Serbian and some Russian. My father is a telegraph mechanic or engineer. Taken down by me. Meshed : E. A. F.

INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY TSUMBER 50 FOR THE WEEK ENDING THE 15TH DECEMBER 1917. Khorasan and North-East Persia. 545. Russian force. — The question of Finances for the future is causing anxiety to the Officer Commanding, Russian Troops, more especially with irres ponsible Maximalists in possession of the base of supply at Tashkent. Some time ago a large consignment of sugar was despatched to the Russian Bank here who were to sell it, and make over the proceeds in Persian currency to the Officer Commanding, Troops. This was held up on the Russian frontier by the embargo on export of provisions from Russia, and during the process a goodly portion of the sugar has disappeared. ^ Colonel Gustchin is sending to-day 30 Cossacks to Dushakh, where the sugar is lying, with orders to take it over— forcibly if necessary—and to bring it to Meshed. The 1st squadron, which has been relieved on cordon duty south of Turbat-i-Haidari, is expected here on the 17th instant. Pending its arrival the Russian force in the town is very small. During the week routine orders have been received signed by the Maxi malist Officer Commanding, the Turkistan Military district (so styled). Colo nel Gustchin has deputed an officer to the General Officer Commanding, Cos sacks Division at Samarkand, to ascertain what line of action should be adopted in this respect, and also to make himself acquainted with the trend of events at Tashkent. 546. Austrian prisoners. —The Austrians prisoners have been very care fully re-examined, the most intelligent of them* in confrontation with the *&lt; agent from Turshiz. Their story bristles with improbabilities as regards the escape from Said-ud-Din, but they steadfastly maintain its exactness. It is on the whole impossible to avoid the conclusion that the escape—if it ever occurred—must have been made with the tacit approval of Mir Zabi Khan. To take one point only—the whole party were together when they observed some 30 Persian pursuers, 2 to 4 miles distant, coming fast towards them, the country at that point being quite open. Granting that, as they say, Wagner and Ghulam Riza were well mounted (although the horses had had practically nothing to eat for two days) their escape from the pursuers who had steadily followed the party for the best part of three days, and who were hardly likely to relinquish the chase with the quarry in sight, requires considerable explana tion^ These prisoners, together with the two Turks, will probably leave under Russian escort for Birjand on the 18th instant. 547. Local affairs. —Great insecurity prevails on all routes from Meshed to Russian territory, and robberies of travellers seem rather the rule than the exception. The despatch of troops against the Barbaris appears to have fallen through for the present, but considerable unrest still prevails in the Jam district. The local paper— JBahar —produces an exceedingly scurrilous anti-English article, the inspiration of which may be with confidence attributed to Hajji Hussain Agha; and as long as this individual remains in Meshed, no cessation of the intrigues for which he has been responsible for the last six monthsi is to be expected. Pailing his expulsion and that of a few other undesirable characters effective action is difficult. There is no Governor-General, and the Karguzar, who is acting in that capacity, is, apart from anything else, seriously ill, and physically unfit to cope with a difficult situation. Events in Russia and an uncertain future appear to have sapped the very small amount of energy and intiative with which the Russian Consul-General was originally endowed. Herat and Afghanistan. 548. Germans and adherents. —Kazim Beg has been enquiring about Russian conditions, evidently with a view of departing thence should events permit.

His indiscretions have again aroused the disapproval of Herat authorities. 549. Conscription measures. —It has already been reported that the Naib Salar has been preparing lists of the population with a view to the exaction of compulsory military service for i man in 8 of the population. On the 4th instant he sent the completed lists to the Naib-ul-Hukumah with a request for his signature and approval of the necessary measures being taken. The Naib-ul-Hukumah returned the lists with the reply that the present year was unsuitable in view of the difficulties which an insufficient harvest had caused the population. The Naib Salar again sent in the lists asking that they should at least be signed ; their enforcement would depend on the Naib-ul- Hukumah’s further sanction. On this condition the latter affixed his signature. 550. Reliefs. —A squadron of the Cbaharyari cavalry regiment has pro ceeded to the Ghorian frontier, and one of the Turin regiment to the Balamur- ghab frontier in relief of cavalry units stationed there. 551. Military infantry battalions of the 1st brigade were paraded by the Naib Salar, who installed Brigadier Abdul Bauf Khan in command of the brigade. Certain cavalrymen, who preferred requests to the Naib Salar, without the sanction of their officers were dismissed the service, but ordered to find recruits in their stead. Field and mountain guns have been taken out for practice. Russian Turkistan. 552. Current Early in the week Maximalist disorders were ex pected at Askhabad, but these have not apparently materialised. Had they done so postal and telegraphic employes in Transcaspia had resolved to strike On the other hand telegraphic communication with Tashkent has been reopened for the last few days, and the Officer Commanding, Russian troops, here has received ^ several telegrams on matters of routine signed by Praporschik Per- i ca P^ i ^ of National Commissary and Commander of the troops ot the 1 urkistan Military District. No newspapers from Tashkent have arrived curing the week and the “ Askabad ”, which is either under Maximalist influence or in fear of the Maximalists, contains no news whatsoever. The attached “ Communication ” is of especial interest for the following reasons (a) The ‘‘1st Regiment ” referred to is the 1st Semirechia Cossack Regiment on cordon duty in Khorasan. Had therefore events permitted, its recad to participate in the Tashkent conflict would evidently have been carried out quite irrespectively of the duties which it is performing in Persia. ^ .

Under the subsequent bombardment the Cossacks were compelled to evacuate the fortress, leaving their horses behind. Those cap- t0 u “ m ! ntl o na We barbarities by the Maximalists.

It is undoubtedly a fact that they are lacking m organisation but from reports received this week it is also clear that ene£ ? i 1 vu^ t0S ^ CUre 1 S ^ ch0rganisati0nare beiD S made. Native residents at Askhabad have already been reported to 4he-obtaining arms and to be organi sing tor self-defence against such outrages as were lately perpetrated at Tash kent. Arrivals from Bokhara and Samarkand report a similar process, the reason at present given being that “ the Russians are now unable to arrange for their own safety and order, much less for ours. It therefore behoves us to take what measures for self-protection we can.” At the present stage it is difficult to l^mge how far this attitude is caused by the conditions of disorder extant - a sufficient justification and how far pan-Turanian propaganda may be res ponsible It is at any rate the thin end of the wedge, and a population organised and armed for self-protection can easily turn these advantages to other uses. A report from Merv states that 6 delegates from Baku Musalmans have recently been at Merv, explaining to the natives the nature of the popular movement in the Caucasus. They then proceeded towards Tashkent, taking with them 6 delegates of the Merv native population—it was said for the purpose of receiving instructions as to future action. In this instance there can be little doubt that pan-Turanianism is at work. The Herat agent reports this week the arrival there of two delegates from the Khivan (IJrganj) Turkomans. After an interview with the Naib-ul- Hukumah they were treated as honoured guests, and it is understood that the purport of their communication has been submitted to the Amir, whose reply they will await. r J Meshed ; 15th December 1917 .)

Rumours are current in the town that many members of the committee have been killed or captured, but confirmation of this is difficult to obtain. The Maximalists are carefully concealing who is at the head of this rising, but it is evident that the Council of Soldiers Deputies is responsible. The position is exceedingly critical. Give any help you can as we have little hope, and the Maximalists are receiving reinforcements from across the Caspian. On the side of the Provisional Government are only the School of Sub lieutenants—about 500 strong— the Military School—115 strong— 2 armoured cars, and the 17th Orenburg Cossack Regiment. Of these one half have been killed or wounded during the last three days ; the remainder are still fighting. The whole town is in the hands of the rebels. The Cossacks and Yunkers only hold the Portress and the surroundings of the telegraph. We are in personal telephonic communication with General Korovnichenko- His words are “ We earnestly beg you to send not less than one regiment Machine guns and a battery ; more if you can. The rebels have artillery and are bombarding the Fortress with 6-inch shells.

Other places are useless. Besides the workmen and soldiers the Maximalists have in their ranks Austrian prisoners of war, icho are serving the Artillery. The Musalmans are all on the side of the Provisional Government, but are not organised. In the garrison tliere are only three batteries, but we have in the lortress only three guns on which we can rely. M 15th November 1917. The Portress has been taken by the rebels.

They appear to possess instruments such as heliographs and perhaps a field telephone. They are said to have gone in the direction of Kandahar. They had 11 good camels with them. The belief of some of our reporters is that the party had come from Sarhad. More probably it consisted of superior Afghan officers. (2) A band of Gurg robbers, under Amir Khan, from Hazar Juft has been raiding camels in the Sabzawar district. The band was attacked by Sardar Fathullah Khan of Girishk and the stolen property (mostly camels) was recovered. This account may perhaps be another version of the fight mentioned in last week’s diary.

The departure for Meshed of Parviz Khan, the IzizRais-i-Nazmiah (para graph 12 of Diary No. 46), is also mentioned by our Agent. 13. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Matters here have taken an unex pected turn in favour of Shaji-us-Saltanah. As reported last week, he was obliged to return to Meshed without taking up his post of Governor of Jam on account of the recall of the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik and the consequent annulment of all orders given by him and the return to Meshed of the force which had been sent to instal hinn The officer in command of the latter force, however, before his departure had invited the assistance of the Barbari headmen, and after the return of Shaji and his troops to Meshed one of these with a powerful contingent of well armed sowars arrived on the scene, and the Barbaris after a skirmish in which they were forced to retire^ inflicted a severe defeat upon the forces of Shaukat-ud-Daulah and the Ilbaigi Kaudani who evacuated Jam and fled to the desert habitation of the latter. Saiyid Haidar, the Barbari chieftain, then sent a letter to Shaji-us-Saltanah inviting him to come and assume the Governorship. This is now being opposed by the Karguzar as acting Governor-General on the ground that the interference of the Barbaris had not been intended by the local Government, and I can get nothing out of my colleague in the way of help, as he has now discovered that it is better to allow the Persians to arrange their own affairs. The next step is, therefore uncertain, but to make peace and call off the Barbaris seems to be adv'sable, as view that the opportunity is a good one for shewing that government orders must be obeyed is not appreciated. The position of Haji Husain Agha has been considerably strengthened by the successful demonstrations made against the appointment of the Naiyir-ud- Daulah (paragraph 1 of Diary No. 46) and the outrage committed upon the house of Najd-us-Saltanah, and he is becoming even more difficult to deal with. T News from Herat.—One Muhammad Taki Kabuli, a servant of Sirdar Ishak Khan, having been deported to Persia by His Majesty the Amir has reached Herat. 15. The Naib-us-Saltanah has ordered the Naib-ul-Hukumah to take early steps to recover all outstanding revenue, and he is sending out officials to various places with this object. 16. The arrival of thirty more families of Baluch emigrants is reported. They have been sent to Chakhansur as usual. r J 17. A serious robbery occurred at the village of Paichaki on the night of the 20th November. Two persons were killed and a large amount of property was carried off. The matter is being dealt with. . 18 - 0n November the 17th the two Austrians, Von Gruden (Kroten) and Dimitrovitch, brought a horse to the Naib-ul-Hukumah saying that Wagner had desired them to present it to him after his departure. The Naib accepted the gift. Subsequently the Austrians shewed to him and to the Naib Solar a photo graph of a group of persons and asked whether they could recognise any of them This the officials were unable to do, and they were surprised to hear that the group was of Wagner and his companions disguised for crossing the frontier into Persia, the Naib-ul-Hukumah remarking that the chance of their being detected was very small. (The excellence of this disguise was the cause of the attack upon the party by Persian Karasuran in wh ch Bayerl lost his life.) 19. On the 19th ^November the two guides who had accompanied AVagner's party returned to Herat. They brought letters from Wagner for Kazim Beg and the Maulvi Barkatullah : and were paid by the Austrians through the Naib-ul- Hukumah 2,COO Kabuli rupees reward, after which their services were dispensed with.2 °.

(This ™ 11 l te ff tmg m view of the g uides statement that they had escorted him to Meshed.) 22 . Kazim Beg on the 22 nd expressed great indignation to the Naib-ul- Hukumah on the subject of the Austrians’ treatment of him as an officer, and announced his intention of shooting them which as such he has a right to do. The Aaib pointed out that the Afghan Government would scarcely approve of such an action as that, and offered to use his good offices with the Austrians, but he is said to have been much displeased with Kazim Beg on this occasion. T rt reP ° r i S and r i umo “ rs u re g ardin g the route taken by Wagner are con- flicting. Hie guides mentioned above say that they escorted him to Meshed, whereas Nasrullah declares that he passed by Tabas and dismissed the guides at or near that place. On the whole it seems most likely that the guides were told to give a false version of what had occurred. Meshed ; The 1st Deceember 1917. W. G.

Persian officials. —Telegrams were received during the week announcing the appointment of Samsam-us-Saltanah the Bakhtiari Chief as Governor-General of Khorassan. A protest was made by the local democrats, on the advice of their Tehran friends, in favour of Hashmat-ud-Daulah the democrat nominee, but nothing came of it, and the Samsam has since been accepted by the democrats in consequence of their proposals for the re-organisation of the Khorassan police and Karasuran having been accepted by Government. 2. Shahzadah Ibtihaj-us-Sultan has been re-appointed as Commissioner of Excise, and the present incumbent of the post reverts to that of Chief Inspector. 3. The Matamid-ul-Wizarah is re-instated in the Revenue office, and has expressed regret to M. Kornelis for all his intrigues against him. Sardar Intisar, a brother of the Ma’tamid, is appointed Commandant of the local troops. 4. Persian affairs (local). —With some difficulty we have prevented the des patch of troops to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam for the punishment of the Barbaris who had come to the assistance of the Government troops sent to install Shaji-us-Saltanah as Governor of Jam, and this troublesome question seems at last to be nearing settlement. Nemesis has at length overtaken the arch-intriguer Haji Husain Agha, whose property seems to have been extensively plundered by the Barbaris in the course of their operations. The Haji, who now represents himself as a ruined man, has asked for my good offices to induce the Barbari leader to restore his property, and a rapproachement is likely to follow. Shaukat-ud-Daulah is to come to Meshed 5. M. Kornelis, having been instructed that the local expenses for lighting and sanitation should no longer be paid from the Nawakil or animal tax, has enquired from what funds these very necessary demands should be met. 6. M. Kornelis has telegraphed to the Minister of Finance that all local newspapers are announcing his impending dismissal. He adds that he has no personal objection to this, but that his people will not work satisfactorily for him in consequence of the report. He therefore begs that it may be denied formally, if untrue. 7. The acting Governor-General has telegraphed to Tehran recommend ing the appointment of a strong Governor for the hill district of Kuh Payajats, and suggesting the provision of a salary for such post which will encourage the incumbent to work satisfactorily. 8. Persian affairs (general). —A robbery is reported from Sarakhs which was followed by useful work on the part of the local Karasuran, who pursued the thieves, killing one. 9. British affairs. —The Mullas of Meshed city now hold a secret meeting once a week, and we are taking measures to discover what takes place. In this week’s meeting an Arab who had recently arrived from Baghdad was interrogated regarding the condition of affairs in Irak consequent upon the British occupation. He compared the British administration favourably with that of the Turks, and said | that the Mullas of Baghdad, Najaf and Karbala were especially pleased with the i consideration that had been shown towards the people. He added that since the outbreak of war the Turks had taken forcibly half the property of each subject to pay expenses, etc. 10. Russian affairs. —The possibility of a separate peace by the Rusdan Government has caused a slight rise locally in rouble exchange. Private intelligence « states that a large number of Japanese troops have already entered Manchuria cn route for Russia : and the majority of the local Russian community seem to be quite unconcerned by this news. forthwith.11. M. de Beauvais has returned from Chinaran, bringing some prisoners They appear to have formed part of a gang of thieves who were among those engaged in highway robbery on the Chinaran road, and to have killed a Cossack either in mistake for a traveller who was expected to pass or to throw suspicion on the inhabitants of a certain village the disarmament of which was necessary to their welfare. ^ 12. Persian and German intrigues.—Nothing further has been heard of Wagner (paragraph 11 last week), and some doubt has been thrown upon the statements of the prisoners by the report of an agent sent specially to enquire at Turshiz etc Enquiry is proceeding. 13. We have now two Turkish prisoners in our charge. One escaped from Hamadan and made his way to Meshed, giving himself up to us on arrival; and the other is the man mentioned in paragraph 13 of Diary No. 47, who came out of the Karguzari to visit the bazar and was promptly taken over by a person set to watch for him. My colleague, on being informed, merely remarked that the Karquzar must have lied to him. The latter has asked me to return his prisoner to him but there appears to be no necessity for this. The Austrian mentioned in the paragraph referred to has also been disposed of. 14. At the secret meeting of the democrats held during this week it was decided to publish the fact that the attack on the house of Najd-us-Saltanah (para graph 1 of Diary No. 46) was not the work of the democrat society, which we believe to be true. The vexed question of the Persian Cossack Brigade was then dis cussed, and a proposal was made and agreed to that any Ccssack behaving badly m the town should be arrested by the democrats and handed over to the police. 15. News from Turbat-i-Haidari,—$a,\yi&amp; Hassan, one of the followers of the German party which recently left Herat, has been handed over to the Karquzar by the Russian troops who brought him from Turshiz. He states that he is a charvardar who was merely engaged by the party for their journey to Tabas. On handing him over the Russians have taken an undertaking from the Karguzan that the man will not again enter the service of their enemies. WT • i i a - -ttt vr™ ^auKar-ua-jjauian nas surrendered to the Barban leader Saiyid Haidar, and the latter has dispersed his sowars (para- grap i 13 last week). He has sent to us for further instructions, and will be told in reply to send Shaukat to Meshed and to return the plundered property of Haii Husam Agha (paragraph 4 above) to the latter’s men. It appears that the Ilbaigi Kaudaru and Mir Baki Sultan have disappeared, after abusing Shaukat for beina the cause of all the trouble which had come upon them. ^ n rr A A knuj a-ul-Mulk was also asked for help by Shaukat ud-Daulah m the recent Jam matter, but declined to take part on either side. IS. News from fferot—The Governor ofSabzawar is again under suspicion o; complicity m highway robberies. A caravan coming to Herat from Anardaraf was attacked and plundered but timely help having been rendered by the Zuri tribe the property was recovered and 5 of the delinquents captured. The Governoi has been ordered to report. iy. imrty ramiiies ot babzawans who emigrated to Sistan some years a»o country CelVed permlSS10n froni the Naib-ul-Hukumah to return to their native 20. Dissension is rife among the remaining members of the German party at Herat, and owing chiefly to Kazim Beg’s contumacy the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who has tried to keep the peace, shews signs of losing patience with them. The Naib- &amp;la f , who has hitherto been more inclined to help the guests than his brother official, agreed with the latter in his disapproval of Kazim’s general conduct and both expressed a desire on the 28th ultimo to get rid of him as soon as poskble. The Afghan guard are also complaining of Kazim’s conduct to them. ■ , 21 - , 0 ' the 26th M J au j vi Barkat-ullah asked the Naib-ul-Hukumah to have wmter clothing prepared or the party, and orders were given accordingly. There is no further indication that Kazim Beg and the Austrians will follow inWagner s footsteps, and tlie prisoners in Meshed when asked when they thought they would leave Herat replied with a simle, “ Not until the end of the war.” Probably when they hear of the events at Turshiz they will be less inclined than ever to leave their present quarters. 22. On the 27th Kazim Beg visited the Naib Solar and informed him that, Petrograd was now in German hands and that the Russians were asking for peace : also that the British had desired peace but this had been refused by the German Government. The Naib asked what the source of this information might be. Kazim replied that he had received it from his news-agent in Persia. 23. Nasrullah is said to have stated on the 30th that a telegram had been received from Wagner at Tehran, and our Agent hears that his guides say that he informed them that he would return to Herat within a few weeks. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of thi Government of India in Khorassan, Meshed ; The 8th December 1917,CONFIDENTIAL. ,r 18 JAN 1918 I MAR'1918 Meshed Diary No. 50 for the week ending the I5th December 1917. ■ •4* » ui ' v * 1. Persian officials. —No official communication has been received confirming the appointment of Samsam-us-Saltanah as Governor-General, and meanwhile another protest has been made against him by the local democrats (paragraph 1 last week). For the time being our Karguzar is acting in the post (paragraph 1 of Diary Tvo. 47), but he is indisposed and incapable of work. Haji Husain Agha (paragraph 4 last week), whom rumour credits with trying to obtain the appoint ment himself, is now the most powerful man in the place ; and as I am trying for his deportation for persistent intrigues my hands are full. 2. It is said here that the Tabriz and Eesht democrats have secured the ejection from the present Cabinet of Wasuk-ud-Daulah, Kawam-us-Saltanah, and Mushar-ul-Mulk. 3. Persian affairs (local). —The Karguzar having asked me to write to the Barbari Chief, Saiyid Haidar, airecting him to return to the owners the property which he had plundered from them during his recent operations on behalf of the Government, 1 have addressed to him a private letter approving of his action in coming to the help of the Government when called upon, but adding that I regretted to hear that he had gone too far and that the British could never be friends with people who committed such excesses as those of which, according to report, he had been guilty. In conclusion I urged him to make restitution, but there is reason to believe that matters have been (much exaggerated except as regards the Taimuris, who made the first attack, and have only themselves to blame. Meanwhile Haji Husain Agha tries to cajole and frighten me by turns. After paying a long visit on Sunday last with the apparent intention of expressing regret at our strained relations and invoking our assistance in the matter of his stolen property, he has arranged for the publication during the week, in various local journals, notably the democrat organ Bahar, of a series of cmfo’-British articles of more or less virulence. In the democrat article there is literally no political crime of which we are not accused nor any unfortunate situation, past or present, in the modern diplomatic world for which we are not responsible. My colleague and I have telegraphed to Tehran recommending his deportation for a time, and it is hoped that some result may be possible which will give Khorassan affairs a chance of recovering from the Government of Kamran Mirza. 4. We have received some interesting information regarding the pro-German activities of Major Lemberg, the Swede whom the local democrats, acting on the advice of Haji Husain Agha’s creature Saham-ul-Mulk, had proposed for the post of Superintendent of local and provincial police in Khorassan. My colleague and I have asked that this appointment may be prevented. 5. The Prime Minister has sent a reassuring message to the local democrats to the effect that their proposals for the reorganisation of the police will duly be carried out by the Governor-General who is about to be appointed. 6. On the night of the 12th instant a report was received by the Police Com missary of the Bala Khiaban quarter that five Zushki robbers were in the house of one Karbalai Husain Khan Daulatabadi. The house was attacked by the police, but the robbers managed to escape and have not yet been apprehended. They left, however, some arms and ammunition in the hands of the police. 7. In reply to his reference regarding the report of his impending dismissal (paragraph 6 last week) M. Kornelis has been told that his ability to work need not be affected by any such rumours. 8. Persian affairs (general). —M. Delcorde, the Provincial Director of Customs, has written strongly to the local Government complaining of the extent to which Lis work is adversely affected by the condition of the province, and he has kindly sent me copies of the communications made, as also those of telegrams which hehas received detailing thefts and outrages in different localities. There is, however, nothing to be done under the present regime. 9. Many of the thefts and robberies constantly reported are due to wide spread poverty resulting from famine conditions. Cases have occurred during the week of organised highway robbery at Kalat, where two caravans were raided ; Khakistar where a determined attack upon the Customs office was with difficulty reuulsed ; and also at Rushkar, where even the Naib-ul-Hukumah seems to be in fear of his life. 10. No rain of consequence having yet fallen, prices are rising and distress is increasing in almost every part of the province. 11. British affairs. —The complete returns are not yet in from the Customs office, but from those I have received the month of ’Akrab (24th October to 23rd November) appears to have been a most successful period commercially. British and Indian goods which paid duty at Meshed and those destined for Khorassan which paid in Sistan are together valued at Rs. 5,82,150 ; and to these the statistics of the Karaiz office have yet to be added. This month shows a gratifying ? increase in the goods imported via the Nushki route. 12. Russian affairs. —Large numbers of bad characters from the Caucasus and elsewhere have swelled the number of Russian subjects in Meshed recently, and the Consul-General has now no satisfactory means of dealing with them! Some days ago one Saiyid Ja’far fired at a shop-keeper during an altercation, and was arrested and confined in the Consulate. It is hoped that he may be deported. 13. For some weeks now our Russian friends have been entirely dependent upon Reuter for news of their country, but my colleague informed me yesterday that he had declined to recognise M. Trotzky as Minister for Foreign Affairs. None of them seem to have any idea of how matters are likely to go. 14. Persian and German intrigues. —Permission has been received for the despatch to India for internment of the Austrians Jandl, Frantz, and Krause, and arrangements are being made for their despatch accordingly. It is hoped that they will be accompanied by the two Turks mentioned in paragraph 13 last week. 15. Neivs from Shahzadah Adal-ud-Daulah, who is still Governor of Turbat, has proposed that he should be supplied with funds to raise a special force to defend Turbat against the Barban tribe whose recent punishment of the rebellious Taimuris appears to have inspired him with wholesome fear. It is more likely, however, that he sees a chance of enriching himself at the expense of Government, and his proposal is not to be adopted. 16. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—Saiyid Haidar, the Barbari Chief, is still at Jam, where he has Shaukat-ud-Daulah in custody pending instructions which have been sent to him as mentioned last week. As soon as Shaukat arrives in Meshed it will probably be convenient to send Shaji to Jam, but there is practically no local Government which will decide upon a course of action • while my colleague has no desire to take action if it can be avoided. The question of Haji Husain Agha will, if is hoped, be decided within the next few days, after which there will be no further difficulty in this matter. News from Karaiz—Mtev his defeat by the Barbaris the Ilbaigi Kaudani fled to the frontier where he fell m with a party of his tribe who had taken no part m the fight with the Barbaris. Mutual abuse was followed by another conflict m which two of the Ilbaigi s men are said to have been killed. 18. An attack upon a caravan by robbers is reported from Kila’ Da’gharu in which a small quantity of indigo was carried off. Shuja-ul-Mulk, at the instance of the British Agent, has sent out some sowars to trace the thieves. He has also kindly arranged for the escort of our dak sowar while passing through the locality mentioned. J 19. News from Herat. —Six Turkomans have been sent in to Herat by th e Governor of Kushk, v ho reports that they came from Russian territory to tako sanctuary with the Afghan Government. , The Naib-ul-Hukumah has offeredthem Khalisah land at Ubih, but they seem to be disinclined to accept this, preferring to remain near Herat, to which the Naib objects. 20 . The Indian doctor has received permission from the Naib-ul-Huhumah to send a messenger to Delhi to bring his wife to Herat. 21. Two regular sowars having been sent to Dahana-i-Zulfikar for the special purpose of escorting to Herat two persons who were to be the guests of the Afghan Government returned on [the 4th instant with two Turkomans who were accommodated by the Naib-ul-Hukumah, after a private interview, in the stable of the Chahar Bagh. They are said to have come on behalf of the Urganj Turkomans. It is not known what passed between them and the Naib. 22. On the 5th instant Kazim Beg sent his man Haji Ahmad to make enquiry from the new arrivals, and he conversed with them in Turki for about two hours ; after which he returned and reported the result to Kazim. The Naib Solar was much annoyed at this, and subsequently placed two sentries over the Turkomans to prevent anyone holding intercourse with them. 23. Nasrullah announced on the 6th that all Turkomans had rebelled against the Russian Government and had sent these two representatives to discuss the position of their tribesmen with the Amir. He also stated that the Russian Government had now ceased to exist, and that the Germans now governed Russia. 24. On the 7th instant it was said that the Naib-ul-Hukumah had sent the statements of these Turkomans to the Amir for orders, and that they are now waiting for a reply. One of them is stated himself to be a Sirdar of the Urganj Turkomans, and the other to be a member of the Muhammad Zai tribe who had recently been in Russia. Meshed : 'j W. G.

H Meshed Diary No. 51 for the week ending the 22nd December 1917. 1. Persian officials. —An official announcement of the appointment of Samsam- us-Saltanah as Governor-General of Khorassan has at last been received. He has been asked by various people to accelerate his departure from Tehran, which it is hoped he will do, as the Karguzar is still unfit for work (paragraph 1 last week) and nothing is being done. 2. Sirdar Intisar (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 49) arrived at Meshed on the 20th instant, and has assumed charge of the post of local Commanding Officer of troops. He is accompanied by a brother, Dr. Amir Khan. 3. Persian affairs (local). —Saiyid Haidar, the Barbari Chief (paragraph 3 last week), has replied to my letter denying the charges of inhumanity which the Taimuri leaders supported by Haji Husain Agha have brought against him ; and Haji Mirza Khalil, a much-respected merchant who resides in Mahmudabad near Jam, has come to Meshed to explain to the local Government what actually took place. Accord ing to his evidence, in which complete confidence may be placed, the Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan made the first attack on the Barbaris, who had no intention of fighting, and as I had supposed the Taimuris merely received their deserts. I am therefore continuing to oppose the despatch of troops to punish the Barbaris, and so far have been successful, but telegrams are still being sent to Tehran on behalf of the Taimuris and the danger is not yet entirely past. Haji Husain Agha, while outwardly professing to trust me for the restitution of his stolen property, is telegraphing periodically to Tehran lying accusations against _ the Barbaris, who disbanded their forces several days ago and are perfectly quiet. Among other inventions he has reported that they will probably raid Meshed city itself. 4. The local price of bread has now risen to 6 hrans per man and distress is increasing in consequence. An inch and a half of snow has fallen during the week, and more seems to be probable. 5. Persian affairs (#eweraZ).—Robberies are said to be of daily occurrence in the neighbourhood of Chinaran, and the majority of the inhabitants have taken sanctuary in the local shrine, no result having followed the usual recourse to the telegraph office. 6. Robbery and outrage are reported from Sarakhs, Khalat, and Nau Bahar ; and no improvement in the general condition of the province in respect of lawless* ness can be recorded. 7. Snow to a depth of several inches has fallen at Chinaran, Darajaiz, and Shirwan. 8. The Governor of Nishapur has arranged with the local grain proprietors to sell wheat at tumans 35 per kharvar to the quantity required to carry the populace on to the next harvest. Bread is to be s jld at 2j krans per man, and the arrange ment seems to be an excellent one which could well be imitated elsewhere. 9. The troublesome band of Zushki robbers under Muhammad Zabihullah recently attacked the village of Shandiz near Jaghark and were driven off with a loss of 9 killed and 3 wounded. It is to be hoped that less will now be heard of them at least for a time. 10. Cholera is reported from Bujnurd, where there have been 5 deaths. 11. British affairs.—About one lakh of rupees may be added to the value of import trade from India during the month of ’Akrab (paragraph 11 last week), which brings the registered total up to some seven lakhs. But there has recently been congestion of traffic at Karaiz, owing to insufficient transport, which has only just been relieved. On the 20th instant no less than 1,009 camels laden with sugar entered Meshed city.12. Russian affairs .—AH the officials connected with the Kussian Consul- General have received during the week a notice from the Maximalists that they must either acknowledge the present regime or consider themselves removed from office. I am told that all have declined to accept the Maximalists. In the course of conversation during the week Colonel Meshetdtch, the Commandant of the Persian Cossack Brigade, told me that although they had received their nay regularly up to the end of November they expected difficulties for the future. ^ 13. The Officer Commanding the Cossack Regiment in garrison has received orders to call in his outlying detachments and be in readiness for transfer to Russia and has replied that he must be supplied with funds for the move. He expects that this difficulty will cause considerable delay, if indeed it does not prevent the transfer for the present; but states that as the instructions come from the Cossack organisation (and not from the Maximalists) they must be obeyed provided that no insuperable obstacles exist. . Jl y colleague received a visit a lew uaya since irom a represen tative body of his Muslim subjects resident in Meshed. They asked him to give them an accurate idea of the present state of affairs in Russia, as they did not know whether or not to believe the newspaper reports. M. Nicolsky is said not to have given them any reply, at which they were much displeased. 15 The return to Meshed is reported of Haji Kardash Bala and Husain Bala two ruffians who were expelled from Meshed by the Russian Consulate-General about lour years ago. Protests have been made against their being allowed to remain m ileshed, but although they are his subjects my colleague is not able to oppose their return m present circumstances. ^ * 6 - P ersian and German intrigues.—hi. Delcorde informed me four days a&lt;m that he had heard of the arrival at Daragaiz of two escaped Austrian prisoners. Jtnquiry is being made. The probability of an increase in the number of such persons who may make their way into Persia is causing some anxiety, but although circum stances appear to favour the escape few r have entered Persia so far. fDaraiJl! 16 !

The arrival is reported from Kandahar of a preacher whose object is to promote the unity of Muslims, for what precise purpose is not known. JNasruliah has been heard to express approval of his perorations. n , . 27 ; K^ini Beg and Maulvi Barkatullah lunched with the Naib Solar on the utli instant, and Kazim informed him that Wagner had reached his destination safely and was now m Turkish territory. (This tends to support the belief that he has gone to Aleppo.) _ The Naib asked whether he had heard from him. Kazim replied m the negative, but added that he must have arrived safely as the Eussians mr to arrest such persons now and the British had no power to do so. Ine Amo then asked whether the rumour of a separate peace between Germany and Kussia was a true report, and was told in reply that Eussiahad made peace having no alternative, and that the other Powers would have to follow suit. 28. On the 10th Nasrullah and Asghar spread a report in the town that Eussia had made peace, and that the Germans had thus been able to send all their troops to the western front, where they had defeated the English and French, forcing the latter also to cease hostilities. The townspeople, as on a former occasion, declined to believe these stories, saying that they had heard already so many false reports. v Tarkoman Si r d ar (paragraph 24 last week) is under treatment for three bullet wounds which he said were received when fighting with the Eussians. It is now said that this man is of the Akhal tribe, and that he has come to raise troops m Afghanistan to fight against the Eussians. . 30 - Kazim Beg became angry with his servant Asghar on the 14th on account of his failure to bring him news from the caravans arriving from Persia. The servant replied that the people would not impart to him any information, and was told that he should inform them of his connection with the Turkish officer Kazim Be 0- when they would tell him everything. 31. The dissensions among the remains of the German party continue to be acute, and the Risala sowars in attendance upon them are much annoyed because their duties are increased by the fact that Kazim and the Austrians no longer ride together. Meshed : W. G. GEEY, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General The 22nd December 1917. and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C568E.D.—24-1-18—30—E,A.i &lt; l 2&gt; CONFIDENTIAL Sr Meshed Diary No. 44, for the weekending the 3rd November 1917, 1. Persian officials. —The Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has received notice from the Home Office that they are prepared to confirm him in the post of Governor-General of Khurasan on payment of a sum of money amounting to something over tumans, and he has asked me to obtain this latter sum from the Imperial Bank which he will repay in six months with interest. The matter is being considered. 2. The necessary papers appointing Shaji-us-Saltanah (paragraph 2 last week and previous reports) Governor of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam have been delivered to him, and he leaves Meshed to-day with a force composed of 50 Government sowars, his own men, and a small body-guard of Persian Cossacks, to take up his post. The Mushawir has also written to Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakhurz, ordering him to give Shaji any assistance he may require. This matter is thus satisfactorily settled, and it is not believed that the party of Shaukat-ud-Daulah will give any further trouble. 3. Persian affairs (local). —Some thefts of wheat by military sowars are reported, and they are still out of hand owing partly to irregular payment and partly to the scarcity and general poverty which prevails throughout the province. 4. Prince Naiyir-ud-Daulah has not paid the revenue due on his property in the Nishapur district, and orders have been sent to the Revenue office at Nishapur to recover produce valued at 25,000 tumans. The grain thus secured will be useful in present conditions. 5. The local branch of the Union and Progress Society is flourishing (para graph 9 of Diary No. 34). They are collecting and distributing money for charitable purposes, and are generally competing favourably with the democrats in the opinion of the general public. 6. The Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has received an order on the local Revenue office for tumans 10,000 which money is to be spent on the reorganisation of the Karasuran. He intends to introduce a new and improved system, and is only waiting for his confirmation as Governor-General. 7. An attack was made on the night of the 29th ultimo on the house of the father of the murdered Shaikh Mustafa (paragraph 20 last week) by a party of masked Turks, but a cry was raised and the men decamped without having done any damage. The police have not made any captures, however, and the new Chief of Police has not yet inspired the public with confidence. We are still suffering from the effects of Kamran Mirza’s administration. 8. The Chief of Bujnurd has been reprimanded by the Home Secretary on account of a serious post robbery which has occurred between Bujnurd and Shirwan. He has been told that the value of the property stolen, which amounts to 1,625 tumans, must be paid by him in the event of the thieves not being traced. 9. The Mushawir has discovered the value of Haji Husain Agha’s help. The Shikari robbers who were supposed to have made their submission (vide paragraph 5 of Diary No. 39) have again raided the Chinaran district and travellers on the Meshed-Chinaran road. A number of such travellers took sanctuary in the tele graph office at Chinaran as a protest a few days since, and Haji Husain Agha has now been ordered to bring in the robber chiefs for punishment. 10. Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan, has remitted tumans 2,000 to Tehran with a view to secure the re-transference of Shirwan to his jurisdiction. The Chief of Bujnurd has replied to the communication referred to in paragraph 8 above saying that Khuddu is responsible for the robbery in question, and that the value should be recovered from his patron, Shuja-ud-Daulah. 11. British affairs. —The murder of one Haji Muhammad Bangshi, a British subject, on the Saraks road is reported. Enquiries are being made and the matter will be dealt with.j 12. Russian affairs .—M. Nicolsky is transferred to Tehran as Consul-General and is to be succeeded by a M. Adamoff who was at Kirman some twelve years ago. I would be grateful for any information concerning him which anyone may have. y M. Nicolsky expects to leave Meshed about the end of this month. 13. M. de Beauvais arrived at Meshed yesterday the 2nd instant. 14. M. Kornelis, having been asked by the Russian Consulate to supply wheat and barley on payment for the use of Russian troops at Meshed, has replied that certain amounts are due by Russian subjects who have hitherto neglected to pay and that recovery of such dues may be made in kind and the money value paid todiim. ^ 15. Persian and German intrigues .—Four hundred tumanes have’been collected and remitted to Tehran by the local democrats for the purchase of firearms (para graph 20 last week). No meetings have been held during the week owing to the ’ Ashura, or mourning period of the month of Muharram, the tenth day of which passed off without incident in the town. 16. News from Turbat-i-Haidari .—Complaints against the local Revenue officer are general, and if he is not dismissed within a few days it is believed that a riot will take place. 17. News from Karaiz.-—On the night of the 30th October I received a telegram from our Karaiz Agent saying that a suspicious party of twelve travellers, eleven mounted on horses and one on a mule, had been seen on the previous evening near Hashtadan. It was said that the party, who were well armed with rifles, etc.,were dressed as Europeans. Although it was not certain that they had crossed the frontier the Russians* were informed and a telegram was despatched to Sistan and Birjand. 18. A ews from Herat .—The robbery of 100,000 rupees, the property of the son of the late Governor of Hazarajats, Sirdar Abdullah Khan, is reported from the village of Mil Dan near Herat. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered an investigation. 19.

Haji Ghulam Husain (paragraph 32 of Diary No. 34 , etc.), who is now apparently friendly with our Agent, informed him on the 26th that he suspectedthe German party of intentions to leave Herat. He said that Nasrullah on being asked by him had denied it, but that he believed that Nasrullah was hiding the truth from him. 28. On the 27th October, after the post had been despatched, it was reported to our Agent that the previous night Wagner, with some servants and baggage, had left the town proceeding towards the Kandahar road. He thereupon sent a special messenger to inform the Agent at Karaiz, and had the party followed. His further report was received this morning. It seems that Bayerl, the Austrians known as Ghulam Riza, Hindi Franz, and Mirza; Abbas Ali, Agha Karim, and Ismail, Persian servants ; with guides named Ghulam Riza Khan, Ahmad, and Baid-ullah ; all accompanied Wagner who gave out that they were going on a shooting expedition. The following are still in Herat:—Ali Khan (an Austrian), Nasrullah, Muhammad Arab, and Puri Khan, at Bagh-i-Kartah ; and Kazim Beg, Maulvi Barkat-ullah, and the servant Asghar, at Bagh-i-Shah. The man sent to follow the party on return reports that they went first in the direction of the Kandahar road, then changed direction towards the west, spent the night of the 28th in Shikaiwan, and proceeded next day to Ghurian where he left them. It seems likely that they have crossed the frontier at some point between Ghurian and Rui Khaf, but further news is awaited. Meanwhile besides Sistan and Birjand, Isfahan, Kirman, and Shiraz have been informed by telegraph. Our Agent reports that Wagner has not taken his papers with him, which j\ suggests that he intends to return. 29. Our Karaiz Agent has sent in one Ahmad who is believed to be both the man mentioned above and that of paragraph 32 of Diary No. 42, who are undoubtedly one and the same. He has just arrived, and is under examination. Meshed ; W. G.

Russian force .—There are no changes in Russian dispositions since last month. The arrival of the draft of some ICO men has brought the strength of the 1st Semirechia Cossacks temporarily to about 900. Men of longest service will eventually be drafted into the 2nd Semirechia Regiment in the Astrabad region. 504. Local affairs.— Shajji-as-Saltanah is starting for Turbat-i Sheikh Jam provided with official documents reinstating him in his office and accom panied by a force which it is hoped may be sufficient to prevent any resistance. Hajji Hussain Agha is now enjoying some local unpopularity. The looting of Shahdiz by robbers is generally ascribed to his instigation, and savars employed by him are said to have been present. The idea is that he uses his influence with the Zushkis and Shikaris to give him importance with the acting Governor-General, and that he arranges trouble with the object of getting the credit for quelling it subsequently. The democrats are talking of taking the matter up. Turkomans have recently brought in some 70 horses for sale as well as about 200 camels. So far I have only heard of the purchase of one rifle. They have also been selling livestock at Persian Sarakhs and in other parts of INorth-East Khorasan. One of them informed an agent that they desired to emigrate to Afghanistan as the Russians were calling for one labourer per family. The Russians have been informed. They have no knowledge of any such labour levy of which also there is no mention in current papers. Herat and Afghanistan. 505. Germans and adherents .—On the 30th ultimo a telegram was re ceived from the British agent at Kariz saying that in consequence of infor mation that 12 persons in European dress, well armed and mounted, 11 on horses and 1 on a mule, had reached the Persian frontier in the Hashtadan region by little frequented paths, he had proceeded to the spot with 10 savars lent by Shuja-ul-Mulk. He saw nothing of the party but left 2 savars to investigate. The Russians were immediately informed and Colonel Gustchin telegraphed a warning down the line. Similar information was despatched to our cordon at Birjand and in Sistan. The report of the Herat agent received on the 1st ultimo chronicle rumours of the approaching departure of some of the party who were evidently trying to disseminate misleading information. On the 27th ultimo he heard that Wagner with apparently most of his party and followers, including some baggage, had left the Bagh-i-Kartah at midnight on the 26-27th October by the Kandahar road. As the date on which the party was reported in Hashtadan was the 29th October there is little doubt that this was the German party from Herat. No further intelligence has reached us, and as a matter of fact it cannot yet he said with absolute certainty that they have actually penetrated into Persia, although there is a strong probability of their having done so. Granting that they have done so their objective is in all probability Tehran. The Tabas road is indicated in that case, and steps to intercept them should they pass the cordon have already been taken. In addition the Officer Commanding local Cossack Brigade has been requested to telegraph to his Chief at Tehran with the object of watching any road by which they might reach the capital.% There are of course other possibilities; they may have approached the frontier to divert attention to certain points, and then proceeded either north or south within the Afghan border, but this supposition is hardly likely. It is not certain whether Kazim Beg accompanies them, but it appears likely that he does. 1 r Apparently they started accompanied by an Afghan cavalry escort. The Afridi deserter is said to have expressed great regret at his ill-consi dered step. He complains bitterly of the Turkish treatment of subordinates and has a poor opinion of the military spirit prevailing, which, in his view is* only sustained by the presence of German officers. Muhammad Hassan Khan, the head doctor at Mazar-i-Sharif, recentlv arrived here having left Mazar on about the 20th October. He states that Mohendro Partap was present when he left, and that there was no question of his proximate departure. Of the four Sikh followers who accompanied him from Aiazar to^Wakhan two deserted in that region and were supposed to have been mak ing for Tibet. According to him there has recently been a great influx of Austrian prisoners at Mazar, two o^ three men arriving under Afghan escort every second or third day. They are said to cross the ^frontier at various points, but by Afghan orders are all sent to Mazar. There' they receive 2 krans per diem for subsistence, and in addition poshtins, shoes, socks and necessary clothes for the journey to Kabul whither they are sent in batches under escort. About 5 weeks ago a “ German ” officer arrived at Mazar on horseback with a guide. ^ He was wearing uniform and had both sword and rifle. He was accommodated in the Arg for a fortnight, after which he wa.s despatched to Kabul with an escort of 15 savars. Strict orders for the careful interroga tion of the escaping prisoners has been given. Any Russians found amon°- them are to be returned to Termez and handed over to the Russian authorities against a receipt. Ihe Officer Commanding Russian troops requested me to give him the details regarding the Austrian prisoners in writing with the object of informing iashkent It is doubtful, however, under the present chaotic conditions, whether they will be able effectively to check such escapes, especially as, if thev have any organisation at all, they must be aware of them long before the intelligence can reach us. ° uc incidentally arrivals report that 3 escaped Austrians recently passed the Persian frontier near Dushakh,but their subsequent movements are not known 506. Herat troops.—^ Naib Salar is chagrined at hearing that promotions he had made to ‘‘Assistant Brigadier,’’ “ Assistant Colonel,” etc., P have not been confirmed at Kabul, and that no pay can be disbursed for such appoint ments until a/a rmara on the subject has been received from Kabul. He has accordingly instructed his clerk that no such appointments will be valid without the countersignature of the Sipah Salar. ^imout M ith reference to the warlike speeches of the Naib Salar the Herat acrpnt gives hlS opinion that these are prompted by the desire to Lepire leal in all subordinates, and states tha; with the depleted cadres of the Herat o&gt; arr i s o n nothing definite could he contemplated until the order for the local conscrip- i n of i man per 8 be put in force. He considers, however, that reports of question 8611 * StateS ° f affairS “ E ' USSia ^ haVe SOme bearin g °n the The captain, complained of by the Governor of Chakcharan for inter ference in civil affairs and oppression of the inhabitants, has been, together with a subadar and havildar, brought to Herat. The decision of the Naib Salar was ha they should produce three, two, and one recruit respectively after which they might be dismissed the service. Pending the production of he recruits they should be set to sweep the streets. 507. Kabul. Arrivals from Kabul at Herat state that the soldiers of the Kabul garrison are very young. They are being trained intensively, and have already been distributed to brigades. Each brigadier trains his men as he thinks best, taking his men outside the city for the purpose. They seldom return to the lines before noon, and frequently as late as a or 4 p.m. r\ *'508. Masar-i-Sharif. —The Naib-ul Hukumah is reported to have received orders to enlist 600 Treasury savars for revenue collection, and that in future no regular cavalry are to be employed on this duty. Eecruits are said to be coming in -well for this formation, and the measure is welcomed by the inhabi tants. Russian Turkistan. 509. Current events. —Although open disorder seems to be at an end for the present, and M Kerensky has despatched a telegram congratulating the inhabitants of Turkistan on their loyalty and good sense, reading between the lines and from reports of native arrivals matters appear far from satisfac tory. The self-elected “town commandant” has been treated with great leniency and is even reported to have left for Petrograd as a deputy of some sort, though his return has been ordered. General Korovnichenko, also, when announcing the approaching trial of ring-leaders by military court was at some pains to state that extenuating circumstances would be taken into the fullest account. An officer, recently adjutant of the 6th Siberian Eifle Eeserve Eegiment at Merv, and an active worker in raising the Polish Legion at Tashkent, was shot in the street by a soldier wffio had been discharged as unsatisfactory from the legion. The soldier admitted a preconceived plan for shooting the officer, his reason being that the victim was a consistent upholder of discipline. The soldier was condemned to 8 years’ penal servitude. By all accounts soldiers generally are very much out of hand. Men of the 1st or 2nd Siberian E. E. Eegiment recently looted 600 puds of flour from their ^ regimental store, alleging that it was theirs as they only received 1-| lbs. per diem instead of 3 lbs. as was their due. Civilians receive j lb. per diem. At Merv arrivals say that soldiers do much as they like. Outside the city, however, Turcomans are responsible for highway thefts. Prom all accounts there is a great deal of peace talk among soldiers. A recent case was reported at Kushk where some soldiers, in a state of intoxica tion, paraded the place with hurrahs “ for peace and our German brothers ”. Cossacks appear to be sufficiently reliable ; there is talk of the possibility of conflicts between them and the undisciplined soldiery. Caravan roads in the vicinity of Askhabad are so unsafe that a service of Cossack patrols, accompanied by militia, has been instituted. Modified patrol ling is carried out even in the town. All lamp-lighters at Tashkent struck on the 15th October for about a week. A proposed strike of tramway men for higher wages did not apparently materialise. No further reports of interest regarding the Musulman attitude have come to hand recently. E. A. P. EE3)L, Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staff Officer, . Meshed : 3rd November 1317,G. M.

It is said that Abdul Aziz Kudbedani of Daki Dela has been appointed Thanedar on this duty and that Sardars Ata Mahomed Khan of Chahar Burjak and Mahomed Wali Khan of Bandar-i-Kamal Khan have each supplied five sowars to the temporary station at Shah Ali Mardan. There is a rumour in Sistan that a Sistani caravan has encountered the Afghan Baluchis and been carried to Chakhansur; also that a Sarhaddi caravan taking dates into Afghanistan has been similarly treated. A nephew of Abdul Aziz is said to have been wounded. This official has given out that he intends to leave Sistan. He recently reported to Tehran that all the other high Persian officials were on too friendly terms with the Consulate and that they should be replaced, failing which he begged for a transfer for himself. He was told in reply that his recommendation could not be carried out. If he really wished to go, a relief could be sent down, but no other appointment could be given him.

PRIDEAUX, Lieutenant-Colonel, HU Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain.F 1 DENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 42, for the week ending the 20th October 1917. 1. Persian officials .— The Musliawir-ul-Mumalik has received a telegram from the Home Office instructing him to inform the people who had telegraphed asking for the appointment of Naiyir-ud : Daulah as Governor-General (paragraph 4 of Diary No. 39) that in the opinion of Government the Mushawir himself would be a better selection. He summoned a representative body of townspeople and read tins document to them. After some discussion the company telegraphed again, informing Tehran that they had no objection to the Mushawir, but merely wanted the matter settled as soon as possible and a Governor appointed. week. He is elderly, and seems harmless. 3. Persian affairs {local). —The views of the acting Governor-General upon the question of the sowars required by Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakhurz (paragraph 13 of Diary No. 15 and previous references), for frontier work, have been called for by the Government, who have sanctioned the entertainment of certain local sowars in some parts of the province. 4. On the night of the 14th instant one Shaikh Mustafa, a harmless individual, was assassinated by some persons unknown, but believed to be democrats, in mistake for Shahzadah Hashin Mirza who resembles him. On the night following the murder some men visited the house of the Shahzadah to make sure this time of their man, but he had in the meantime escaped to Nishapur. This agitation is connected with the dissensions which have for some time existed among the local democrats. 5. On the night of the 13th a theft took place from the house of the Rais-ut- Tujjar. Property valued at tnmans 5,000 was carried off. 6. Further misconduct on the part of members of the Persian Cossack Brigade f is reported. On the 13th instant a party of Cossacks attacked the shop of a baker j in the town, and were punished by the Commandant for their misbehaviour, | whereupon a large party proceeded to the shop, beat the owner and his assistants | and carried off' the money in the till. Steps are being taken to deal with the matter. ^ 7. The local branch of the society of Union and Progress is taking up a more anti-democrat position than they were supposed to occupy. The possibility of open warfare with the local democrats and the desirability of procuring arms and ammunition have recently been discussed at their meetings. 8. The arrival of Shaukat-ud-Daulah from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam is still awaited (paragraph l,last week), but it has been definitely decided that Shaji-us Saltanah, with an order from the local Government appointing him Governor of the whole of the Jam district and a sufficient force to ensure his installation, will leave Meshed on the 22nd should Shaukat not have arrived. 9. Persian affairs {general). —The Governor of Sabzawar has forwarded the j^Qj^gy of the Imperial Bank which he had detained on account of local insecurity with an escort of 25 sowars. 10. The Governor of Darajaiz complains that his Karasuran not having been paid will not do their work, and begs to be allowed to resign. The Mushawir has refused to accept his resignation, and has referred the question of the unpaid salaries for urgent consideration at Tehran. (See paragraph 3 of Diary No. 36.) 11. A robbery took place during the week on the Meshed-Cliinaran road resulting m the disappearance of one box out of several containing Revenue funds which were being brought in to Meshed. 12. Robberies are also reported from Turbat-i-Haidari district, the Governor inn $j| 2. The t new Chief of Police called upon my colleague and myself during the of which, Shahzadah Adal-ud-Daulah, is known to be a patron of brigands. A /caravan of 50 loads of cloth en route from Kirman to Meshed, 14 of which loads were the property of British subjects, has been plundered between Yunsi and Faizabad. The dismissal of Adal-ud-Daulah will be effected as soon as the Mushawir is confirmed in the post of Governor-General. 13. Shuja-ud-Daulah and the Chief of Bujnurd continue to complain of one another to the Home Office, who merely send on the complaints of each party for report by the other. Shuja has again protested against the Chiefs persecution of the robber Khaddu, who, according to him, has now become respectable. 14. British affairs. —One lakh of rupees may be added to the estimates of the value of the Indian goods imported into Khorasan during the month of Sambalah (vide paragraph 12 of Diary No. 40), for those imported via Sistan. The Herat route is still much preferred, as it is said to be so much quicker. At an interview on the 18th instant the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik congratulated me on the success which has attended our efforts to revive trade between India and Khorasan, and expressed his acknowledgments on behalf of the people of the province. Our Agent at Herat states that there are no less than 3,500 kharvars of sugar there awaiting transport which is not available for the moment, and we hear that a caravan of three hundred camels bringing cotton cloth for the British firm of Hakkak Brothers has just left Sistan. 15. Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan mentioned above, has paid in another 1,000 tumans of his debt to the Imperial Bank. This now leaves 1,500 more to be paid of his first instalment of 7,500, and urgent telegrams have been sent by the local authorities instructing him to pay the balance forthwith. 16. A useful piece of work on the part of the ea-robber chief Muhammad Zabih-ullah is reported. One Sakinah Khanum, the daughter of a former British Agent at Meshed, Haji Abbas Khan, having been robbed of rifles and other propertv by some person unknown, complained to Muhammad who is now responsible for law and order in the districts which were formerly the scene of his marauding activities, and he succeeded in tracing the thief and recovering the whole of the lost property. 17. Russian affairs.—My colleague has not yet received definite information regarding his proposed transfer (paragraph 6, last week), but has also induced his subjects and proteges to protest against it. Meanwhile M. de Beauvais has arrived at Askabad en route to take up his former post. 18. Ihe Manager of the local Russian Bank is leaving Meshed shortly, and M. Guerra, the Chief Accountant, is to act as Manager for the present. 19. The Austrian prisoner (paragraph 8, last week) is still in the Nazmiah. 20. Persian and Gerynan iyitrigues. —Our local democrats are quarrelling over the subject of the a/pproaching elections ; every man apparently wishes to be elected to the Majlis himself and objects to the election of the others. It is believed to be in connection with this that the life of Hashim Mirza was attempted (vide paragraph 4 above). 21. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—The Meshed Karguzar is informed by the Foreign Office that the late M. Mikhailoffs mistress has taken sanctuary with the Governor of Turbat on account of her treatment by the Vice-Consul, M. Antipoff. In consequence of a reference made to him by the Karguzar, my colleague is arrang ing for the woman’s despatch to Russia. 22. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—It is reported that Shaukat-ud-Daulah, upon receipt of the letters ordering him to return to Meshed mentioned in paragraph 8 above, sent for the Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan in order to confer with them as to what he should do. The former had not yet arrived when our informant left Jam. • v . Shaukat has also made desperate efforts to win SHuja-ul-Mulk over to his side, but they do not appear to have been successful.23. News from Kariz.~lt having been reported to Shuja-ul-Mulk that one Ismail, a relative of the celebrated Khaf robber Mir Yusuf, was at Dahanah Shiyah where he had erected a fort and established a depot for the collection of plunder, a force of sowars was sent to deal with the matter. A fight ensued, in which Ismail was killed, and four of his men arrested. The Bakhurz sowars found a large amount of stolen property. 24. News from Herat. is said that the deaths from cholera up to the 5th instant amounted to 600. The disease is said to be dying out. 25. The Governor of Gulran reports the arrival of 20 families of emigrants from Persia belonging to the Zuri tribe, who state that more will follow. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has directed that they should be sent into the interior, and not permitted to remain on the frontier. (These emigrations are the result of famine conditions.) 26. The Maulvi Barkat-u llah led the 1 d prayers on the occasion of Id-i-Kurban in the garden of his residence ; the congregation including the Afghan sepoys on guard duty. Subsequently he gave part of an address in Arabic which contained a reference to a Shiah saint. The result was that the sepoys objected, saying that the Maulvi was himself a Shiah, and some altercation ensued : Kazim Beg taking the opportunity to point out to the company that they did not know the tenets of their religion, apparently with the object of suggesting that Shiahs and Sunnis were one. 27. The Naib-ul-Hukumah and Naib Salar visited Wagner at the Bagh-i-Kartah on the 7th instant, and remained with him for about an hour. It is not known what passed. They then went on to Kazim Beg, with whom the departure of Captain Sidik Beg to Kabul was discussed. Some objections seem to have been raised by Kazim in regard to the person who should go in charge of the party, and upon the Naib-ul-Hukumah deciding to send Muhammad Zaman Khan, Kazim’s mihmandar, a difficulty was raised as to who should replace him. Our Agent was told that Kazim insisted upon having some person of a distinguished family as mihmandar, and that the Naib-ul-Hukumah finally said that he supposed that either he or the Naib Salar had better take up the post. 28. The Government ponies which conveyed the party mentioned in paragraph 27 of Diary 32 to Kabul have returned to Herat. The groom who accompanied them states that the German was sent to be housed with Austrians at Aliabad, the Turk to Bagh-i-Charmgar : and the Baluch to the Kabul kotwal for safe custody. 29. Nasrullah stated on the 10th instant that the Tqrks had driven the British gut of Egypt with great loss. A Kandahari trader who happened to be among the audience said that he had recently returned from Quetta where he had been told by Indian sepoys who had just come from Baghdad that Baghdad was in the hands of the British who were treating the shrines of the Imams with respect: that there had been no fighting in Egypt: and that up to the present the Turks had been defeated generally. 30. The Afridi mentioned in paragraph 24 last week is to be sent to Kabul with Sidik Beg shortly. 31. Sidik Beg is said to have expressed regret at having come to Herat, saying that had he known that they would send him to Kabul he would not have tried to escape. 32. Our Agent reports the return to Herat from Meshed of Ahmad (paragraph 29 of Diary No. 40), and that he crossed the frontier near Abbasabad, avoiding the Kariz route. He is said to have delivered his letter to some person here, and to have brought back a reply. We are trying the trace the recipient of the letter. The other man, Baidullah, is said to have gone to Khaf, where he is to send a telegram to Tehran : and only to come here should anything prevent the despatch of his telegram from'Khaf. We will try at least to obtain a copy of this telegram. W. G.

Dated Q ‘ O'* 4 so NOV 1917 i 10 JAM 1917 | Meshed Diary No. 43, lor the week ending the 27th October 1917. I 1. Persian officials.—Ihz Karguzar has received a telegram from the Foreign Office expressing displeasure on account of a paragraph which has recently been published in some local papers dealing with the misconduct of Muazziz-ud-Daulah (paragraph 5 of Diary No. 38) while Karguzar of Meshed. The Foreign Office say that he served them to their satisfaction while here and that they intend shortly to give him a good post. Perhaps they suspect that this Karguzar him self inspired this article, which is a fact. 2. Persian affairs (local). —Shaukat-ud-Daulah (paragraph 8 last week) has not come in. The departure of Shaji-us-Saltanah and a detachment of troops has now been delayed on account of the Muharram mourning period, but the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has renewed his solemn promises to take the necessary action early next week. 3. The Mushawir has suppressed the democrat newspaper ‘ ‘ Chaman ’ ’ for a period of 3 months, ostensibly on account of an article which appeared recently on the subject of revenue in which the public were urged not to pay the duties demanded of them, but in reality on account of the editor having espoused the cause of Naiyir-ud-Daulah who is still a candidate for the Governor-General ship. 4. The Mushawir is not pleased at the fall of the Cabinet. He seems to think that his.confirmation as Governor-General is now less likely, but zstumans 15,000 are said to be required as pishJcash his chances are poor as he has not that amount of. money. 5. Eight Kaini robbers have been arrested at Nishapur and brought in to Meshed where they are imprisoned in the Nazmiah. 6. The grain question is again becoming serious ; the bazar price having now risen to 44 tumans per kharvar. The Mushawir has suggested the importation of six thousand kharvars from Sistan where wheat is said to be selling at 5 or 6 tumans \ this, he points out, will be on sale here at 30 tumans. On account of famine conditions it has been found necessary to remit the payment of revenue grain in some cases, and the contributions of the province are almost exhausted. ?/m. Kornelis has telegraphed to Tehran asking for the arrest of Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan, his late deputy at Sar Wilayat, who has apparently absconded with tumans 4,000, and is believed to be now in Tehran. 8. Persian affairs (general). —A robbery is reported to have taken place near Naubahar on the Chinaran road in which the post and travellers’ money and pro perty valued at about 3,800 tumans was carried off. 9. Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan, has been favourably reported on to Tehran by the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik for successful work in connection with the outlaw Ahmad and his gang : he having recently killed the chief and captured the whole of his men. 10. An encounter in Shirwan district between the Deputy-Governor and the robber gang of one Ghulam Kiza, who have lately been troublesome, resulted in the death of the robber chief and the capture of two of his men who have been brought in to Shirwan. 11. The district of Sabzavar is also in disorder, and a force sent out recently by the Governor to Arghand which place was the scene of a robbery on an unusually large scale has produced no result, the commander having sent in a message to say that the outlaws are in great strength and that his own force is insufficient in numbers.s;.ara;- 2 12. British Shuja-ud-Daulah, after some delay and expostulation has paid in the balance of the first instalment of his debt to the Imperial Bank • the second instalment of 7,000 tumans is due in February next. So far this is highly satisfactory. ° ^ 13. The Mushawir-ul-Mumalik, acting under the advice of Haji Husain Agha has confirmed the appointment of the robber chief Muhammad Zabih-ullah as superintendent of the villages in the hill district lying to the north-west of Meshed • and the latter has commenced raiding and plundering in virtue of his authority We have some proteges in and around Jaghark, and these have appealed to us for assistance. Fortunately our relations with Muhammad are good, so that their interests are not likely to suffer. 14. Russian affairs.—A Russian Cossack was recently shot at and wounded on the Turbat-i-Haidari road near Kafir Kila, and three men have been brought in to Meshed and imprisoned in the Nazmiah. The life of the Cossack is not in anv present danger. y 15. The Austrian prisoner (paragraph 19 last week) left Meshed on Sunday last in a hired carriage for Tehran. By a previous arrangement with my colleague in formation was given to the Russian troops, and the man was re-arrested by them at Sharifabad, brought back to Meshed, and imprisoned in the Russian Consulate General. 1 , 6 ' M. Nicolsky has not yet received a final reply in regard to his proposed transfer to Tehran, but has had a telegram from the Minister pointing out in reference to all the applications made by friends here for the proposal to be dropped, that such a popular person is just the man for Tehran at the present time. ^ ^ P ar ty Cossacks, to the number of 160, have just arrived in Meshed rom Askabad. A suggestion was made for them to remain at Kuchan nendinfr the expiration of the Muharram mourning period, but it was not accepted by the officer commanding on the ground that all arrangements for the onward iournev had already been made.

He cannot therefore be our suspect: who is possibly his son. Our He&amp;rt Agent is of opinion that this is the Abdur Rahman for whom we are searching, and I hope to have enough evidence to arrest him by the end of next week. Meanwhile he has secretly changed his residence to put us off the scent; but m this has not been successful, and continues to be watched. -News from Turbcit-i-Shaikh Jam. Shaukat-ud-Daulah has also sent for Nasrat-ul-Mulk in addition to the Ilbaigi Kaudani (paragraph 22 last week), but neither of them has answered his summons. 23. It is reported that the roads in the neighbourhood of Jam have become unsafe generally. 24* News from Karaiz.—Tte astute Shuja-ul-Mulk received Shaukat’s peacemaking deputation (paragraph 22 last week) with politeness, and gave the usual return present when the men left him. They did not succeed in converting mm to the cause of Shaukat, however. Now 8 from Horat. —Two Russian Turkomans who had emigrated to A ghamstan some time since and obtained an advance from Government asked permission from the Naib-ul-Hukumah to reside on the frontier, giving as a reason that they wished to bring some of their relatives across the border. The Naib refused consent, saying that if they wished to return to Russian territory they must first repay the advances they had received. 26. There is no longer cholera in the town, but a few cases still occur in the neighbouring villages. 27 • gi ik Beg, Usman, and the Afridi Ghulam Muhi-ud-Din, left Herat for Kabul via the Hazarajat on the 14th October, escorted by a party of sowars. Wagner and Kazim Beg accompanied them for a short distance. 28. Maulyi Barkat-ullah is reported to be seriously ill, and the Indian doctor is attending him. The latter has been informed by the Naib Salar that his fate depends upon the Maulvi’s recovery. 29. Wagner imprisoned his man Muhammad Arab for quarrelling with a fellow-servant on the 15th instant. 30. On the authority of Usman (paragraph 27 above) Kazim Beg is now said to be of Circassian origin. 31. A conversation between the Naib-ul-Hukumah and the Naib Salar on the subject of Kazim Beg took place on the 17th, following on a complaint made by Kazim against the Governor of Bala Murghab who, according to Sidik Beg, had spoken disrespectfully of the Turks, describing them as irreligious, etc. Both officials spoke unfavourably of Kazim, alluding to his neglect of religious duties. ; 32. Nasrullah stated in the bazar on the 18th instant that the Naib Salar had shewn to Wagner a newspaper article describing the ejection of the British from Baghdad with great loss of life. He remarked that Wagner was much pleased to see the article. 33. Mahendra Pertab writes to Kazim Beg from Mazar-i-Sharif that he is suffering severely from boils and cannot go out or walk about. He bewails the absence of good medical treatment. 34. Our Agent heard on the 19th that Wagner’s servant Abbas Ali was desirous of leaving for Persia, and has informed his brother, our Agent, at Karaiz. 35. I have received a cordial reply from the Naib Salar to a letter congratulat ing him on his recovery from cholera. W. G.

From a mention in the papers of Russian troops at Astrabad these appear to consist of a Cossack Regiment (probably not all at Astrabad itself), the i? 1 Battery, . section of Sappers, and a field hospital. There is no mention of infantry. Apparently Genera! Loginov is in command ot this torce. 464. Prisoners and susfects.-Tte Austrian “ medical ” prisoner is still at . the Nazmiah. He receives many visitors and dispenses prescriptions and anti-ally propaganda with equal impartiality. I brought the latter portion of h.s activities to P the notice of the Officer Commanding, Russian troops, early in the tveek and learnt with surprise that he had not been informed of the prisoners presence. He subsequently addressed the Russian Consul-General on tie Lhiect statin* that he would take over the prisoner. The Consul-General hnplored him not to act, and promised to do so himself. The prisoner however ™ sail in Persian hands, and recently informed an agent to whom he supplied a prescription that he was about to be sent to Tehran for liberation. Owing to his evasive statements, the Russian Consulate-General considered A r. N oai (paragraph 448), the man in possession of Austrian notes, sufficiently fuspSs to be s P ent to Transcaspia under escort for further invest,gat,on. Th» Turkoman in possession of Austrian coins, noted last week was found, and stated that he had obtained the money from Austrian prisoners in the course of trade. 46 =; Local affairs. — Shaukat-ad-Daulah has definitely refused to come to V A a\ Persian force is to be sent to Jam to exert pressure. The selection of Salar Nusrat, a former energetic Chief of Police who rendered us service for the command is a reasonable guarantee for the performance of the Anniication was made to Tehran for the employment of a portion of Colonel Mamonov's Persian Cossack Brigade for this service, but a reply was received that the demand must come from the ocal Persian authorities. The received tnat however, stated that he had instructions from Tehran not to remoTise this force officially, and could not on that account apply for it. Tnvthing more unsatisfactory than the actual status of the local portion of the Cossacks Brigade can hardly be conceived. Saham-ul-Mulk the ongmal fomenter of the agitation against it, has nofcbeen removed from Meshed, nor are there any indications of any such action in the future. Kamran Mirza, the late Governor-General, left for Tehran at the end 0 last week, being pursued for some distance by anxious creditors. Turkomans from Transcaspia are said to have sold some 60 horses in the city recently, and to have purchased arms with the proceeds. This information has been transmitted to the Russians. According to Russian information tot cases of cholera and 99 deaths occurred at Astrabad itself between the 17th and 26th September. As there is no mention of the Russian troops there having been attacked, the numbers are not improbably exaggerated.

The latter also refused to forward a parcel to Kabul for the Germans by special post, and it is fairly clear that he has no great svmDathv with them. J v ll y A look out is being kept here for two messengers to whom Wagner is said to have entrusted letters for Meshed. Arrivals who left Mazard-Sbarif for Meshed via Russia on about the 2tfh September state that Mahendro Partap was then there with no indications of approaching departure. 467. Military a fairs.—The cholera has evidently put a stop for the time to the exercises of the troops, the Naib Salar himself being attacked by the disease on the 22nd September. On hearing the news the Naib-ul-Hukumah promptly mobilised the Indian doctor and assistants, and proceeded to his colleague’s assistance. The latter recovered quickly, and on the 26th September was inspecting the barracks of thejadidi Herati and 9th Herat! battalions which are under reconstruction and repair. An Artillery Captain died of the disease. Risaldar Yar Muhammad has been brought to Herat from Chihildukhtaran and remains under medical treatment. * A list of the promotions recently made by the Naib Salar has been forwarded to Kabul for record. 46S. Mazar-i-Sharif. The harsh treatment of the population of this province by the Naib-ul-Hukumah, and the departure of many of them to escape his exactions are confirmed. It is said that secret complaints have been made to Kabul. In spite of the order for the discharge of old and unfit soldiers the lattter are held in default of a substitute and a bribe and a recent case is quoted of an old man who had to provide 2 recruits and a bribe of 50 tomans before securing his release. No ordnance or rifles have apparently been received lately and normal drilling of the troops is in progress. J Russian Turkistan. 469. Current affairs. A serious situation has occurred in Turkistan the upshot of which is not yet clear. The special precautions to deal with any movement in sympathy with General Kornilev were relaxed but as a stnrmv meeting at the House of Liberty at Tashkent resulted in a split of the elements concerned into maximalists and minimalists, the former being in a decided majority, open-air meetings on succeeding days were forbidden. On the 25th September a meeting at the House of Liberty, originally on he subject of food shortage was developing in the opinion of the two chiefs of the Workmen and Soldiers Committee in a direction subversive of order The' conveyed their apprehensions to General Cherkes, Commanding the Military fnd S 0 he V!eWO R -fl hef p Ctthata o Umberof S0,die ^ mainly belonging to the 2nd Siberian Rifle Reserve Regiment, were concerned provided himseif with an escort of '• yunkers ” from the Officers Traini’ncr School and proceeded to the scene. He found that a body styling themlelves the . P ro ' lsl ° na ' revolutionary committee, ” and arrogating to themselves all autho rity, was ,n process of formation, and arrested the ringleaders who were convey ed to prison After reporting to the Turkistan Council, who approved his action he returned to the House of Liberty to pelsuade PP the me ing to disperse quietly but found the place in an uproar. The rioters pressed ,n upon turn, and one of them struck him on the head with a bottle causing a severe wound. The General, drawing his sword, escaped to the street where he was afterwards found unconscious, and the leaders of the work- men and ooldiers Committees with difficulty made good their escaoe The rioters then proceeded to elect two sub-lieutenants, (of more than indifferent character) to the offices of commander of the troops and city respectively released their arrested leaders, and with the more riotous members ofexistin-committees formed a joint &lt;f provisional revolutionary committee,” and declared ithat they had assumed all administrative powers. Disorderly measures followed ncluding tne arrest of several principal military officers and functionaries of the provisional government by means of house to house perquisitions. They announced their intention of requisitioning funds lying in non-Govern- ment banks, and occupied the post and telegraph buildings. Some looting of stores at the railway-station occupied, and general anarchy and much alarm pre vailed. The native population were apprehensive of a massacre. Beyond speed ing about in motor cars, the leaders seem to have accomplished little or nothing, and were apparently becoming apprehensive of the consequences of their action, an alarm which the report of the departure of two Cossack regiments from Orenburg for Tashkent considerably increased. On the 29th September a severe telegram was received from M. Kerenski, ordering the release of the arrested officials, threatening the forces of disorder with severe punishment, and stating that the new Commissary-General with a Commander of the Military District, troops, and machine guns, were on their way. The movement, which is clearly the work of maximalists, found a modified echo at Askhabad where the streets were patrolled by troops under orders of the “ provisional revolutionary committee,” the Governor’s residence, and the post and telegraph offices occupied. Further disorder does not seem to have occurred there and the Commissary, M. Dorrer, has called on organisations and individuals loyal to the republic to support him, and declared his intention of repressing any anarchy by armed force. The above^account is derived from the “ Askhabad ” up to the issue of the 3rd instant. No official report of these occurrences has been received here, but on the 30th September the Officer Commanding Russian troops received a telegram from M. Nalivkin, the President of the Turkistan Committee, to the effect that he had assumed command of the troops of the Turkistan Military District. He subsequently received a telegram from the President of the “ Cossack Circle*’ that the Provisional Government, the majority of garrisons, and the population, refuse to acknowledge the authority of the usurpers. The Russian Consul-General has no information whatsoever. From the newspaper account and M. Nalivkin’s telegram it may be inferred that M. Kerenski's telegram has had its effect and fhat Nalivkin is carrying on pending the arrival of the promised officials and reinforcements, the movement having collapsed, but this is merely conjecture at the present moment. No native arrivals have been noted since these events, but all persons arriving previously gave accounts of the prevailing insecurity of life and property through out Turkistan at the present time, and expressed their conviction that such conditions must inevitably lead to open disorder. Meshed; ^ E. A. F. REDL, 6 th October } Lieutenant^ Colonel l G, $. 0., S2284GSB-~38-8-lM7~GCBFns SECRET. Intelligence Summary Number 41 for the week ending the 13th October 1917« Khokasan and North-East Persia. 470. Russ?an force. —The disorders in Turkistan have seriously embarrassed i the Officer Commanding Russian troops for funds for the maintenance of his troops, no remittances, and no answers to telegrams concerning them having been received. He has succeeded in obtaining a sum from the Russian Bank (itself embarrassed) to carry on with, but may possibly be compelled to ask us for assistance in the event of the present conditions being prolonged. During the week notification was received that a draft of some 160 Cos sacks for Meshed would be detained indefinitely at Tashkent, obviously to assist in the suppression of disorders, but the Officer Commanding has just heard that they will leave Tashkent for Meshed to-morrow. 471. Persian Cossack Brigade .—An officer of this formation has arrived here. It is at present uncertain whether he is Colonel Meshedtich, successor to Colonel Mamomov, or Captain Kalugin, an officer instructor who is expected. 472. Local affairs .—The despatch of troops to Jam district has been post poned, Hajji Hussain Agha being 'the deus ex machina responsible. He first operated through the democrats, and when their opposition had weakened, through the religious head, the Aghazadah. The latter’s objection was based on the hardship of quartering soldiers on the villagers at the present time of scarcity. His influence is to be used to induce Shaukat-ad-Daulah to come in within a stated time, failing which the Aghazadah’s objection to the employ ment of troops will be withdrawn. In the meantime great unrest and tension prevails around Jam, and Shuja-ul-Mulk recently mobilised a large number of armed adherents. Cholera appears to be dying out in the districts and Russian reports note an improvement in Astrabad and surrounding villages. It is hoped that Transcaspia may now escape infection. 473. Prisoner .—In spite of a renewed application from the Officer Com manding the Russian troops to the Russian Consul-General, the Austrian prisoner is still at the Nazmiah, although he has been sequestered from the general public. Probably owing to this the 0. C. troops recently received a report that the prisoner had been smuggled off to Tehran in a waggon, and as it was too late to verify the report that night, Cossacks had to be sent to Sharifabad in pursuit on chance. Were we not at war the position would be in the highest degree ludicrous. * Herat and Afghanistan. 474. Germans and Adherents.—W has procured shepherds clothing *L for the Austrians, and after holding a Wss rehearsal, committed the indiscretion of photographing the party. The costume consists of blouse, trousers, and kullah of coarse country cloth with a turban, and a felt cloak of the description usually worn by shepherds and nomads. A false beard, staff, and sack to be carried on the back are to be provided, and shoes, either wooden or skin are to be worn. The Russians and all concerned have been informed, but there is as yet no indication of the direction in which the party intend to move—if such move be decided upon. The two Turks have at last reached Herat, and appear more likely to be escaped prisoners of war than secret agents as the earlier mention of them ap peared to indicate. The principal one is described as a .captain named Hassan Sadiq Beg; in person tall with black mustache, no beard, and brown (actually “ sheep-like ”) eyes. Two front teeth false. The second is said to be a private soldier named Usman, tall, with thick mustache and no beard ; fresh complexion. '-iBoth the Austrians and Kazim Beg are said to he very nervous of the cholera, especially as cases have occurred among the guard, and a farash was attacked. 475. The Naib Salar.—On two previous occasions it has been reported that the Naib Salar has referred to the entry of Afghanistan into the war as im minent. At a recent durbar he addressed his officers still more distinctly on the sub ject, saying that the day was rapidly approaching, and that every officer and man should carry out his duties with the feeling that on any day he might he called upon to tight. He impressed upon commanding officers the paramount necessity of maintaining the arms and equipment of their units in a condition of complete efficiency, and said that any officer found wanting in this respect when the day came would be blown from a gun. 476. Herat garrison .—Owing to the cholera troops parade daily for one hour. They have the melancholy consolation of being attended by stretcher-bear ers in readiness to carry off any man attacked to the isolation hospital at Bagh-i-Kolian. Up to the 4th instant somewhat upwards of 100 men are said to have been attacked but the percentage of deaths is not known. 477. Grain collection .—According to the Herat asrent’s information, 4,000 kharwars of grain are present at Herat from last year’s stock. It is ex pected that 8,000 kharwars from this year’s crop will be collected in the Gov ernment store 3,000 being the produce of Government land, and 5,000 taxes in hind. The Naib Salar is active in ensuring the collection of the full amount. Russian Tuekistan. 478. Current affairs. —No definite news of the suppression of the Tashkent, disorders is to hand, but it is unlikely that the Semirechia Cossack draft, noted in paragraph 470, would have been allowed to proceed unless matters had con siderably improved. The General Officer Commanding the Turkistan Cossacks Division telegraphed at the end of last week that he had been entrusted with the restoration of order at Tashkent, and he would obviously need every avail able Cossack for the task. M. Kerenski appointed General Korovnichenko from the Kazan Military District to the combined functions of Commissary- General and Officer Commanding the troops in Turkistan, and charged him with the task of restoring order and of punishing the guilty persons. A tele gram announcing his arrival and the assumption of command was received here on the 8th instant but no report of the arrival of the punitory troops has come to hand. All responsible organisations of other districts and at Tashkent itself, in cluding leading Musulman committees, were loud in disclaiming the irres ponsible action of the agitators forming the u temporary revolutionary com mittee.” The Turkistan Council, being prevented by the agitators from com municating with Petrograd or other bodies in Turkistan, removed to Skobelev (New Margilan) with the object of obtaining unhampered action, M. Nalivkin, the President of the Turkistan Executive Committee, assuming the functions of temporary Commander of the troops pending the arrival of the nominee of the Provisional Government, in addition to his administrative functions. He appears to have attempted a peaceful settlement, involving an amnestv to the ringleaders of the disorder, and to have telegraphed to M. Kerenski that the despatch of troops was unnecessary. The latter, however, stigmatised any con donation as inadmissible, and has instructed General Korovnichenko to act with the utmost resolution. Nalivkin was himself arrested subsequently by soldiers, but released alter a short detention. He refused, however, to interfere further to prevent the arrival of punitary troops. General disorder and threats have obviously, been rife, but so far no reports of actual fighting have been received here. The attack on General Cherkes seems to have been a most savage one, but a report that he had succumbed to his injuries w r as contradicted.The 1st and 2nd Siberian Reserve Rifle Regiments not only identified themselves with the forces of disorder, but also supported the would, be strikers on the Central Asian Railway. According to the latest newspapers great efforts were being made to avert a strike on this line, which owing to food shortage would bear a most suicidal character, but at the present moment it is not known whether they were successful. Some rioting and looting of shops occurred at Merv. This appears to have been entirely on the ground of food shortage, and unconnected with the maxi malist moment. Erom the fact that M. Dorrer, Commissary of Transcaspia, who had proceeded thither on that account, continued his journey to Tashkent it may be supposed that the local trouble was allayed. Rumours from the Afghan frontier have reached Herat of a disturbance among the Kushk garrison. Papers, however, quote the resolution of the Kushk garrison committee as among those condemning the maximalist move ment. 479. Russo-Afghan -According to native arrivals Afghan robbers ? are active along the Russo-Afghan frontier. Although they have no grounds for the supposition these persons ascribe this action to Afghan government instigations. Prom several sources a rumour is prevalent that the frontier post of Sarai Kamar, in the Termez rayon, has been raided by Afghan robbers, a Rus sian officer and some 12 men killed, and their arms taken. There is no confirm ation in Russian papers. Obviously present conditions on the frontier favour local anarchy and license, and an agent at Sarakhs reports that iron, doors, windows, etc., are being freely brought into Persian Sarakhs from abandoned dwellings On the Prussian side. 480. Khiva .—The officer Commanding Russian troops in the Khivan Khanate reports that the population are in much alarm, and that the Turkoman robber bands are increasing. Sheikh Junaid Khivai (Sardar Kurban Muham mad) has returned, and is active in mobilising men in the N. W. portion of the Khanate. (Reference paragraph 458.) E. A. P. REDL,i?^^.* Colonel, G.S.O.

Russian force - The Cossack draft noted last week are on their wav to Meshed from Askhabad. y 482. Persian Cossack Brigade.— Lieutenant-Colonel Meshetich and Captain Kalugin reached Meshed at the end of last week. Colonel Mamonov is leaving shortly for Tabriz. (Reference, paragraph 368.) 483. Local 0 /Mrs.—Should Shaukat-ad-Daulah not have come in by to-morrow, it has been arranged that Shajji-as-Saltanah should be sent to Jam for reinstatement as governor with a force of Government savarsin addition to his own men. An officer and some 10 savars of the Persian Cossack Brigade would accompany him as a personal escort. Hajji Hussain Agha’s next coun ter move remains to be seen. Frontier robberies of live-stock by Turkoman and other miscreants are reported from Sarakhs Two rifles were stolen from the Russian post at Pul-i- Khatun recently, the perpetrators having escaped. Turkoman continue to import rifles from Persia for sale in Russian territory. Some eight mounted men,relations of Junaid (Kurban Muhammad) were reported to have passed near Sarakhs from Afghanistan secretly on the 16th September, and to have had with them two horse-loads of ammunition. 484. Suspects and Regarding the two messengers said to be en route for Meshed from the German party at Herat (paragraph 466), the British Agent reports that one of them—Ahmad—has returned having delivered a letter. The second man—Beidullah—was to proceed to Meshed, if unable to despatch a telegram to Tehran from Khaf. Three days ago a man answering to his description was noted in the town by an agent °who very unfortunately lost track of him. Search for the man is still in progress. The Russian Consul-General has still delayed taking delivery of the Austrian prisoner at the Nazmiah. During the week a deserting sweeper from Mesopotamia, suffering from fever, surrendered himself at the Consulate-General. He gives bis name as Behari, village Sainpur, district Muzaffarnagar, Post Office Parsoli, and states he was confined at Meerut Jail for theft, transferred to Lucknow, and drafted to Mesopotamia. He left a comrade sick at Sabzwar. Herat and Afghanistan. 485. Germans and adherents .—Wagner is now having his mules loaded up, and with the Austrians, takes them with him on his rides to harden them for the road. It is possible that one fine day—as happened with Paschen—he may not return from one of these excursions. Owing to local conditions and to certain indications of communication between the German party and Turkoman not only in Transcaspia, but also in the Astrabad region, it seems possible that if a move be contemplated it might take place northwards and thence among Turkoman settlements on either side of the Perso-Russipn frontier to the Astrabad region. In any case I have requested the Officer Commanding, Russian troops, to telegraph both to General Loginov at Astrabad, and to General Narbut, commanding the Frontier Guard at Askhabad, giving them details of the latest disguise and recommending vigilance. Kazim Beg appears to have assimilated with some success the Hunnish characteristics of arrogance and tactlessness. He roundly abused soldiers of his guard for some speech displaying intolerance of the Shiah sect, and onPQ tlie question of a change of mehmandar arising shewed such pretensions that the Naib-ul-Hukumah sarcastically remarked to the Naib Salar that he presumed that nothing less than one of the two of them performing the office would content Kazim I3eg, as they were the only people of royal blood at Herat. Orders have been received from Kabul that the Turk Hassan Sidiq Beg should be sent there without delay. Both Hassan Siliq and Kazim Beg are much cast down at the decision. On Nasrullah Khan’s assertions of the capture of Egypt by the Turks beino- contradicted by a merchant recently returned from India, the former attempted to secure the arrest of the merchant as a British spy. 486. Military—Iw pursuance of the Naib Salar’s speech reported last week, considerable activity as to the overhaul of equipment is in progress. The Officer Commanding, Artillery, having reported fuses deficient in number, the Naib Salar had an urgent indent despatched to Kabul and ordered that any other deficiencies of artillery material should be brought to his notice without delay. An inspection of artillery swords was ordered, any defective weapons to be sent to the Arsenal for early repair. In giving orders for the checking of available tents on hand, the Naib Salar enjoined despatch as he wished to prepare tents sufficient for the whole of the Herat troops, and the time available was short. Brigadier Fateh Muhammad Khan was appointed to the command of the 2nd Brigade, but on his representing that the whole of his service had been passed with the Khaki Battalion, belonging to the 1st Brigade, he was given command of the 1st Brigade. The Naib Salar animadverted on the fact that during the cholera epidemic field practices had been abandoned, and stated that soldiers should have no fear of death, either from disease or in battle. 487. Frontier. —An agent at Zorabad reports the strength of the post at Dahna-i-Zulfiqar at about 150 to 170 The captain in command is also responsi ble for the following posts, the strength of each of which is about 25 men. J ub-i-Sarhang. h Kund^h i Sukhtah f (^ e ^ erence Memorandum of 19th July 1917.) Pul-i-Khisht. ) Another informant states that the men at Khatai are still accommodated in tents. Considerable strictness is exercised as to persons passing the frontier. 488 Kabul .—On the authority of a soldier, recently arrived from Kabul at Herat, all old men in the Kabul garrison have been discharged, and units there are under strength in consequence. Recruits are being conscripted on the 1 per 8 basis to make good deficiencies. A report from another source to the same effect has been received. A considerable consignment of rifles and guns is said to be on the way from Kabul to Herat, but no reliable confirmation of this rumour has yet come to hand. 489. Cholera .—The disease, much as it did in Khorasan, appears to have diminished in Herat city and to be spreading among the villages. Some 600 cases, exclusive of the garrison, had occurred according to the latest report. No report of the number of soldiers attacked is given this week. Russian Turkistan. 490. Current affairs —Newspapers up to the J6th instant leave the termination of Tashkent disorders very much to the imagination, but it would appear that the outbreak of an irresponsible minority utterly unsupported by re sponsible elements, both Russian and Musulman all over the country, is at an end. In one sense, it is perhaps a serious indication that so one-sided a movement can have had such disintegrating, even if temporary, conse quences.SECRET. i NOV 1917 | s INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY NUMBER 43 FOR Tttfe WEEK ENDING THE 27TH OCTOBER 1917. Khorasan and North=East Persia. 494. Russian fovce . The Cossack draft reached Meshed on the 26th instant. An exchange of shots recently took place between robbers and a Cossack patrol near Chinaran without result, and a Cossack was slightly wounded by a rifleshot near Sharifabad. In both cases the robbers were the aggressors in the first instance, and in the second case the theft of the Cossack’s rifle was apparently the-object of the attack. The aggressor w^as subsequently secured. It is significant of changed conditions that whereas throughout the course of the war local brigands have carefully abstained from any aggression on the Cossacks, in the last two months three cases have occurred. ° 493. Local q/airs.—Action as to the reinstatement of Shajjhas-Saltanah has been postponed till after the conclusion of Muharram. A further excuse for procrastination will doubtless then be evolved. From Sarakhs Afghan robbers are reported to have raided 700 sheep from Turkoman in Russian territory and 15 camels from villagers between Pul-i- Khatun and Zorabad. A local branch of democrats has been initiated at Persian Sarakhs. 496. Suspects and deserters .—The proposed comedy regarding the Austrian prisoner at the Nazmiah, foreshadowed in a recent Meshed Diary, was duly enacted on the 21st instant. The prisoner was secretly despatched on a private fourgon at 3 p.m. towards Tehran, a report of his “escape” beino* made by M. Nikolsky to Colonel Gustchin at 6 p.m. on the same day. The latter immediately despatched an officer’s party to overtake the Austrian wffio was brought in on the following day and is now in military custody pending return to Askhabad. The unsatisfactory feature of the case, apart from the fact that M. Nikolsky had formally promised to take over the man himself and that it was only on this express understanding that both Colonels Gustchin and Mamonov had refrained from active interference, is the further loss of Russian prestige which already stands sufficiently low. The fact that the Persians had successfully resisted handing over the prisoner to the Russians will be exploited to the utmost, w hile the eventual recapture of the man is quite likely to be denied. The frequent assertion that the Russians “no longer have any power” thus finds abundant confirmation in Persian eyes. Whether action of this nature is likely to check attacks on Cossacks, or robberies of Russian or European travellers generally, or to encourage their commission, is perhaps a question for the Russian Consul-General to settle with bis conscience. On interrogation after recapture the prisoner stated that he was a “ feldsherr ” (medical subordinate), captured in 1915 at Przemysl, and was afterwards employed at a hospital in the Samara Government till August of the current year, when he escaped with false papers which his employment had given him opportunities of fabricating. These papers completely disarmed suspicion on the journey, and he reached Askhabad where he bargained to be driven across the Russo-Persian frontier. As he considered the price asked too high, he returned to Artik station whence he hired a cart to Lutfabad and Mahmudabad. He was there befriended b y the Persian Governor and Customs Officer, the latter opposing his arrest by some Russians, on the ground of Persian neutrality. They apparently telegraphed to Meshed, as on arrival be was met and lodged at the Nazmiah. The Chief of the Police informed him that his case had been referred to Tehran, and on the prisoner’s protest that he was in a neutral country, replied that orders must be awaited. The prisoner himself telegraphed to the Austrian Minister at Tehran for release. Eventually he was informed that he was to be despatched to Tehran,FPW the fare for the journey—/omaws 30—being defrayed by the Persian Government. A deserter from the Jail Labour Corps in Mesopotamia was sent in from Sharifabad during the week. He gives his name as Farzand Ali, resident of Memeyalah, Gujranwala district, and states that he was sei fenced to imprison ment at Gujranwala Jail, transferred to Lucknow and thence to Mesopotamia, tie deserted from Knt-al-Amarah. A companion named Muhammad Alam remained sick at Tehran. Herat and Afghanistan. 497. Germans and adherents Turk, Hassan Sidiq Beg, has been despatched to Kabul via Hazarajat under military escort- He is said to speak French and Bussian. Maulvi Barakatullah is stated to be seriously ill, and Mohendro Partap writes from Mazar-i-Sharif that he is out of health. Kazim Beg has again succeeded in giving umbrage to the Naib-ul-Huku- mah. Nasrullah Khan, on the alleged authority of a newspaper obtained from the Naib Salar, relates the British evacuation of Baghdad, a number of troops being drowned in the course of the retreat. 498. Military.—Orters have been given for the rapid completion of 4,000 sets of horse-shoes for artillery horses. A man was posted at the government workshop to keep the smiths up to their work. Non-commissioned officers are to receive special daily instruction in field practices. The Naib Salar has promoted two of his orderlies ; one to captain in the 9th Herati, and the other to subadar in the Kotwali Battalion. In apphing for two smart orderlies from the artillery he stipulated that they must not belong to the Shiah sect. Russian Turkistan. 499. Current events .—Local Eussian newspapers contain practically no news. General Korovnichenko has made fresh appointments to the command of the Tashkent garrison and analogous posts. He announces that all implica ted in the recent disorders will be tried by military court, and a commission of inquiry is to commence investigations without delay. While order has outwardly been restored it is evident that the condition of affairs remains unsatisfactory, and the officer who arrived yesterday in charge of the Cossack draft confirms this point of view. Supply matters are precarious. Much depends on transport facilities for Caucasus grain. In view of the urgent measures which were not long ago discussed for laying the rails as far as possible towards Vyerni with the object of transporting Semirechia grain to Turkistan it is somewhat surprising to hear of famine in the neighbourhood of Vyerni itself. 500. Musulman unrest .—Native arrivals from Bokhara and Turkistan dur ing the week have had a good deal to say regarding the state of acute tension which all state exists among the Musulmans in Turkistan at the present moment and one individual compared it to a powder magazine only awaiting a spark to set it off. In the view of Russian, Armenian, and Musulman in habitants this state of affairs is to a great extent due to intrigues froin Afgha nistan, and while discounting any probability of the Amir lending his coun tenance to such propaganda, undoubtedly elements exist in Afghanistan from such action might not unreasonably by expected. Some consider that any overt action on the part of the Afghans—or even an unfounded rumour that Afghans had crossed the Oxus—would be sufficient to set going a general re bellion ; others that even in such an event the inhabitants would await the issue for a time and only join in should matters definitely go against the Russians. All arrivals concur in stating that the Russian garrisons, notably in Bokhara at Kerki and Termez, and also at Kushk, have recently been considerably in creased, and this according to some should be sufficient to keep malcontents quiet. Apart from the Kirghiz in Semirechia, the greatest unrest apparently exists among the Yomud Turkoman, sections of whom are already plundering1 twbh n in the Khivan Khanate, and with whom other Turkoman tribes are said to be in sympathy, the Usbegs in the southern and central regions of Bokhara and along the Afghan frontier, including the cities of Shahr-i-Sabz, Kitab, Karsbi, Guzar and Hissar, and the inhabitants of the Samarkand and Jizak rayon in which the massacre of Russians and subsequent reprisals occurred last year. These people are said to have supplied themselves with good rifles and ammu nition and the Bokharan Usbegs to have only been prevented from risihg on more than one occasion during the war—notably at the time of the Jizak disorders—by the influence of the Amir of Bokhara. The Yomud Turkoman are said to have demanded in no doubtful terms the countenance of the Amir of Bokhara to their present proceedings, and to have threatened in the event of an unfavourable reply to plunder in his domi nions as they are doing in Khiva; and there are rumours that such acts of aggression have actually occurred near Charjui. There is, however, no men tion of such occurrences in Russian papers. Musulman unrest in the Caucasus, and the entire absence of discipline among Russian inhabitants in Turkistan, where according to native arrivals “ there is now no government and each man imagines himself a ruler,” are also factors which can only increase the present tension. 501. Arms traffic .—A telegram from the Tashkent General Staff to the Officer Commanding Russian troops in Khorasan expresses anxiety respecting the purchase in Transcaspia of rifles and revolvers by agents of the Governor of Kuchan and the Deputy Governor of Shirwan, who have been, according to reports received, directed to spare no expense in obtaining fire-arms, and who are paying as much as 4,000 rubles per rifle and 500 to 800 per revolver. The Officer Commanding troops is requested to ascertain whether military preparations—by implication hostile to Russia—are not on foot. The cause of this purchase, of which at present we have no confirma tion, may probably be found in the generally unsettled conditions in Khorasan, and in the jealousy between the Chief of Bujnurd and the Kuchan Governor anent the recent transfer of Shirwan to the former’s jurisdiction. On the other hand, a steady if not very considerable stream of rifles flows from Persia into Transcaspia, which it would be greatly to the advantage of the Russians to put a stop to. 502. Transcaspian administration .—A lengthy article in the &lt;{ Askhabad ”, advocating the advantages of the administrative independence of Transcaspia from control by Tashkent, recapitulates in some detail the views of General Kuropatkin previous to the amalgamation of this province in Turkistan in the nineties. While setting forth his reasons in full for the desirability of a single command in Russian Central Asia as a check to possible British aggression, and for that reason recommending both the inclusion of Transcaspia and Semirechia in the jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Turkistan, Kuropatkin con sidered the independence of Transcaspia from a purely economic point of view preferable. The writer maintains that the military necessity for such union no longer exists. E. A. E. REDL, Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staff Officer, Meshed : 27th October 1917.V-. ■ i i JL 6 tt\)S! 1*917 S ECRE T. Intelligence Summary Number 39 for the week ending the 29th September 1917. Khorasan and North-East Persia. 457. Prisoners and suspects. —The companion of the Austrian “ doctor M arrested last week is reported to have made for Bujnurd in disguise. Some Austrian coins have been brought to me, of which a local Jew is reported to have purchased 100 tomans worth from a Turkoman from Russian territory. As the Turkoman was still in the city the matter was passed on to the Russian Consulate-General for investigation, but I have no information of the action since taken. It appears possible that the money may have been the price of assistance in escape. 458. Local affairs. —About 100 of the Zushki robbers have come into the city, appaiently with the object of obtaining pardon and assurances for the future. Except for the fact that Shajji-asoaltanah has reached Meshed in safety* Jam affairs are going from bad to worse. The Kaudani Ilbaigi has been plunder ing freely, two substantial Russian subjects being among his victims; a relation of Dur Muhammad has been murdered in connection with the escape of Shajji, and general uneasiness and insecurity obtains. Certain energetic measures which had been mooted have been abandoned, and the acting Governor, who appears to be entirely in the hands of Hajji Hussain Agha, is relying on the arrival of Shau- kat-ad Daulah at Meshed on a promise of safe conduct, and on a peaceful settle ment of the affair. In view of the outrages which have been committed it is difficult to see how such a solution can have any satisfactory consequences. Agents from Pul-i-Khatun and Sarakhs report the passage (on the yth instant at the latter place) of Sheikh Junaid Khivai (Sardar Kurban Muhammad) to Russian territory. He was accompanied by 14 mounted men, and had with him 5 pony-loads of arms and ammunition. The Russians were duly informed of his departure from Herat, and the agent at Pul-i-Khatun states that he notified the Russian detachment of the passage of the party. It is unlikely that the Sardar woutcl have returned without an assurance of safe conduct from the Rus sians ; at the same time in view of the present trend of affairs at Khiva, the return of the leader of last year’s rising is not without interesting possibilities. Herat and Afghanistan. ■ 1 ** 459. Germans and adherents. —The appearance of cholera at Herat, where some io to 15 cases daily are reported, has resulted in the move of Kazim Beg and Barakatullah to the Bagh-i-Shah outside the city, Wagner has ^ taken measures to isolate as far as possible the Bagh-bKartah from all contact with the city, but was unsuccessful in obtaining the retention of the same guard without relief for the duration of the epidemic. Kazim Beg has again been tilting at the activities of the British agent and professes to feel great anxiety for the safety of Junaid on his return to Russia. The usual anti-ally propaganda continues. The Austrian “ Miuzu ’* has been permitted to make a sketch of a portion of the city. An arrival at Herat from Mazar-i-Sharif confirms the arrival of Mohendro Partap there in July, the respect with which he was treated, and his avowed in tention of setting out on a fresh journey. (Reference paragraph 421, Intelligence Summary 35.) 460 Herat garrison.—With reference to paragraph 431, Intelligence Sum mary 36, the following numbers are reported short of establishment. Infantry. —1,300 short of an establishment of 5,800. The Khasadars, or “ 10th Infantry, ” are not included in this total. They have received notice that they will shortly be relieved by regular infantry on the frontier, and brought to Herat for organisation and training.Cavalry .—220 short of an estabhshment of 800. Beyond completing existing deficiencies it will have been noted that the raising of a third regiment is proposed. Artillery. — 15c short of present establishment of 1.200. Sappers .—Present total strength 200. Khavanin. — Acc urate figures are unobtainable, but little doubt exists that t v e total of this force is very co-siderablv below the nominal total of 4.000. A sepoy of t^e Kandahar! battalion has died of cholera. The Indian doctor has been placed in charge of the preventive measures for the troops, and a garden outside the city prepared for the reception of military cholera patients. The Naib Saiar has appointed four captains to supervise conservancy work in the ciiv. 1 Hi-! iiu f bi if I ■ M ' » VlirWl It- JM I • w / Russian Turkistan. 4^1. Current affairs. —'Si.

In civil affairs he will be assisted by Senator Elpatyevski. and in military matters bv General Cherkes. M. Nafivfdn is requested to continue to act on the Turkistan Committee after his relief by the new Commissarv-General. M. Dorrer has returned from Petrograd and continues to act as Comm-ssan* 01 Transcaspia. Colonel Tnsna, on return from Khiva, has been apoointed Commissary of Syr Darya. As far as can oe judged from the papers, no overt sympathy has been manifested in Turkistan with General Kornilov’s action. M. Nalivkin, accompanied by General Cherkes and others made a tour of the military establishments at Tashkent, and explained to the men the grave consequences ^ hich betrayal of the present Government would entail. T..r Pon-.&gt;.usa.man Session has telegraphed to Turkistan the adherence of its members to the Goverrment. Askhabad Musulmans held a meeting at a mosque and passed resolutions of fidelity. In addition, in view of the grave increase of crime at Askhabad, the formation of a Musulman Band of Public Safety ^as decided upon. This apparently received the approval of local authorit es. Rumours of disorder at Askhabad between -Armenians and Musulmans have been nfe at Meshed throughout the week. Papers, however, contain no reference to this nor have the military or consuiar establishments here, although thev have heard rumours, received any confirmation. Native arrifals report great insecurity at Merv owing to Turkoman lawless ness. Highway robtenes after dark are frequent. The Turkomans are reported to have petitioned the authorities for the deportation of Pe-sians and other foreigners in view of the scarcity of supplies. The unfortuna'e idea seems to exist among the native population that though grain is reallv present the Russian authorities are holding it up more Persic(—w\ order to inflate prices. Arrivals consider that the present general msecurtyand food difficulties are likely to culminate m general disorder. 3 A young officer of the 5 th Siberian Rifles was recently murdered, while shooting near Askhabad, by Turkoman or Kurds, for the sake of his gun. J “ e Turkistan News of the 16th September contains a tele gram m the nature o. an ultimatum from representatives of shipping and transport companies, tne Asiatic Bank, and commercial houses at Khiva generally, to their head offices a&lt; Tashkent that unless prompt measure be taken to suppress the wnolesaie pioneering by \ omud Turkoman, no other course will be open to them than to close down their establishments and leave Khiva.

Actually at inspec tions the Khan is bound to produce 60 mounted men and 10 transport ponies on which he draws pay for 100 men. It appears, however, that malpractices under this head are frequent, khans borrowing horses and even men from one another for inspection purposes. From recent reports it is evident that both the Naib* ul-Hukumah and the Naib Salar are alive to these practices. From various sources the intention of the Naib Salar eventually to allot to the infantry brigades a proportion of other arms has been rumoured. Except in the case of sappers, it&gt; of whom have been attached to each infantry battalion,, no action in this respect has been taken. REDL, Lt.-Col., G.S.O.CONFIDENTIAL. ^ O ’■i 'V - x fJ’ I I / - * • Meshed Diary No. 40, for the week ending the 6th October 1917. 1 . Persian officials. —Kamran Mirza (paragraph 1 , last week) left Meshed on the 29th ultimo accompanied by all his family and retainers. He was supplied with an escort of 30 men from the Persian Cossack Brigade. An attack upon the party was contemplated by some of the Karasuran whose money the Prince had appropriated (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 36), but the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik tells me that he managed to dissuade them from this. x 2. Shahzadah Salar Muzaffar, a former Commandant of the troops at Meshed, is appointed to act in that position vice Iktidar-us-Saltanah who has proceeded to Tehran with his father, Kamran Mirza. 3. The Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has dismissed Sardar Makhsus, the Governor of Turshiz, and has appointed in his place Prince Amir Akram (paragraph 2 of Diary No. 37). 4. The Mushawir is making great efforts to become confirmed in the post of Governor-General, and many telegrams have been sent to Tehran on his behalf. M. Nicolsky and I have no objection to this appointment. 5. My colleague informs me that his protest against the appointment of Husain Kuli as Chief of Police was a mistake, and that he is not the man in regard to whom there are suspicions (paragraph 3, last week). 6. Persian affairs {local). —The Mushawif has prevented the Chief of Police from dismissing a member of his staff in order to appoint another man from whom he had received a present of tumans 100, and has compelled him to return the money. 7. On the occasion of Id-i-Kurban a meeting was held in the town with a view to promote a rapprochement between Shias and Sunnis. It was fairly well attend ed : cordial speeches were made, and good feeling prevailed. 8. Persian affairs {general). —The outlaw Khuddu (paragraph 8, last week) has again telegraphed to the Home Office complaining of the measures taken by the Chief of Bujnurd against him since his pardon by Shuja-ud-Daulah, and suggest ing that the loss he has suffered recently should be made good by the Chief. Mean while the latter has also telegraphed, explaining that Khuddu is a creature of Shuja-ud-Daulah of whose extortion and oppression 3,000 Milanlu Kurds have recently come to complain to him. 9. The death of the troublesome outlaw Kurban in a fight with Government sowars is reported from Kuchan. One of the sowars was killed, but three men of the robber gang were taken alive. 10. Strong action is ordered by Tehran to be taken against-the Khaf robbers (paragraph 7, last week). 11. The Governor of Sabzawar reports that the serious robbery mentioned in paragraph 14 of Diary No. 36 was the work of men of Chinaran and Kuchan. He suggests that their capture might be effected through the Governors of those places. He has detained for the present a consignment of money, the property of the Imperial Bank, owing to the presence of robber bands on the Sabzawar road. 12. British affairs. —The value of British and Indian goods imported into Khorasan during the month of Sanbalah (24th August to 23rd September), exclud ing those imported via Sistan, of which the returns have not yet been received, is Rs. 6,46,125, or over eight lakhs, at the actual present rate of exchange. The articles principally represented are sugar, cotton tissues, indigo, and groceries. If and when the railway on the Nushki route is extended to Robat a company will probably be formed here to provide “ fourgons ” for the journey on to Meshed, and we may have some chance to retain a large portion of the trade recently captur ed when normal times are established.13. Russian affairs.—My colleague has decided to decline the Tehran appoint ment (paragraph 12, last week). In addition to the reasons previously given he thinks that the trouble and expense of moving his establishment would be too great. 14. The question of the Austrian prisoner (paragraph 13, last week) is not yet decided : the Russian Consulate having, on reconsideration declined to consent to the arrangement proposed, viz., that he should be re-arrested at Sharifabad while en route to Tehran. 15. Persian and German intrigues. —Six wealthy democrats of Meshed have subscribed tumans 2,000 for the purchase of a house in which to hold the meetings of the society. To remove suspicion the house when acquired is to be named the “ place of mourning,” and mourning meetings will be held on the premises. Letters from Tehran describe an audience given by His Majesty the Shah to the celebrated Malik-ush-Shura, and again lament the disunion existing among the democrats of the capital. 16. Unceasing search and enquiry for Abd-ur-Rahman, (paragraph 32 of Diary No. 36 and previous reports), have resulted in the production of a man who was formerly in the service of the Farman Farma which he quitted when the Prince went to Shiraz last year. This person, named Yad-ullah (probably a Bahai), says that he has been five months in Meshed doing nothing, which, as he is evidently in good circumstance^, arouses suspicion. Zabi-ullah, the man by whom Abd-ur-Rahman sent his presents to the Herat officials (paragraph 26 of Diary No. 32) is shortly expected and it is hoped that some discoveries may follow his arrival. This Yad-ullah denies everything, but his conformity to the description we have of Abd-ur-Rahman is remarkable. He is being carefully watched, both by our men and those of the Karguzar, who is giving every assistance. 16A. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —The mistress left behind by the unfortu nate M. Mikhailoff is giving trouble to the Vice-Consul in connection with the dead man’s estate. She threatens to take sanctuary in the Karguzari unless M. Antipoff delivers to her the whole of the property left. This he declines to do in view of other claims against the estate. 17. The arrival of and departure from Turbat of a party of 26 Barbari re cruits from Meshed is reported. The local authorities provided th,e necessary escort. 18. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam .—Shaukat-ud-Daulah has not come to Meshed, and we hear that he has no intention of so doing. On the 2nd instant M. Nicolsky and I called on the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik and obtained from him a defi nite promise that he would send an expedition to Jam at once in the event of Shaukat not arriving in three days. This period has expired, and arrangements are being made for the despatch to-morrow of a Persian force under an old friend of ours, Salar Nusrat. My colleague has been instructed by the Russian Minister in Tehran, in reply to his reference regarding the Persian Cossack Brigade (paragraph 17, last week) that a request for 1 their employment must be made by the local authorities here ; and the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik informs me that he cannot make this, as, when leaving Tehran to take up work here, he was warned on no account to recognise the existence of the Cossack Brigade officially. The present arrangements are of course best, provided that serious work is done, and I think that our friend Salar Nusrat can be relied upon for that. Yesterday Haji Hussain Agha, who apparently sees now that his game is played out, sent me a message of apology and regret asking for a n interview. I have replied that I will see him when Jam affairs are satisfactorily settled. 19. News from Karez. —Nasrat-ul-Mulk, the Taimuri Chief of Zurabad, has made a claim against Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakhurz, for certain villages which he represents have been unlawfully appropriated by Shuja. The latter has suggested referring the matter to a Muhammadan court.20. The two elder sons of Shuja-ul-Mulk, who seem inclined to join the Ilbaigi and other ruffians against their father have tried to set me against him, and have been rebuked for their pains. Shuja-ul-Mulk is still prepared for hostilities, and the Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan are said to have made their Way to Nasrat-ul-Mulk at Zurabad, pro bably to seek assistance. &gt; ■ • . 21. Neivs from Herat. —Some anxiety seems to prevail at Herat on account of the cholera outbreak, and various charitable acts are being performed by the officials, such as feeding the poor and setting free prisoners charged with minor offences. The usual religious ceremonies prescribed for such visitations have been carried out. 22. Kazim Beg and Nasrullah continue to spread false reports. The latter stated in the bazar on the 23rd ultimo that Tiflis and other Caucasian towns had already fallen into the hands of the Germans, who would soon reach the Afghan frontier. . 23. Wagner had apparently made an arrangement with the Naib Solar for the exchange of three of his mules for three Afghan horses, but when the time came for the animals to change hands the Naib Solar was ill and the matter was referred to the Naib-ul-Hukumaih. The latter, whose conduct is invariably correct, said that no Government horses can be changed without permission from Kabul. 24. Two men named Nur Muhammad and Ibrahim have been sent into Herat in chains from the Russian frontier, charged with having gone over the border without passports. Nur Muhammad admits having taken a letter from Wagner and has produced it, saying that he was unable to deliver it. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered his imprisonment for having taken the letter without his permission. 25. On the 25th ultimo Nasrullah brought a parcel to the Naib-ul-Hukumah, asking him to forward it to Kabul. The Naib told him to take it to the post office. 26. Wagner has purchased a donkey for one Ghulam Husain Yazdi whom he wishes to send on a mission to Persia. This man has a contracted toe, and will be easily recognisable if he comes in this direction. 27. The two Turks (paragraph 30 last week) have not yet arrived at Herat. 28. Our Agent met the chemist Haji Ghulam Husain outside the town on the 27th. He entered into conversation with him and ultimately the Haji promised to give him all possible information in future (in regard to this man please see paragraph 32 of Diary No. 34 and previous reports). 29. Wagner has arranged with two Heratis to take letters for him to Meshed. Their names and descriptions are as follows :— Ahmad, son of Akhund Wahab —colour light, ring in right ear, thin, grey beard. Baidullah, son of Haji Abdullah Khafi —short, one side of mustache ruined by small-pox. A watch will be kept in Meshed for these persons, and it is hoped that they may help in establishing the identity of Abd-ur-Rahman (paragraph 16 above), W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan. G. M. Pi'oss, Simla.—No. C442I'.D.—5-11-17—30—M.D. Meshed, The 6th October 1917. /CONFIDENTIAL 88 i^OV I'd 17 &gt;. £ v MESHED DIARY NO. 41 FOR THE WEEK ENDING 13TH OCTOBER 1917. 1. Persian affairs {local). —A largely attended meeting of democrats was held on the 8th instant to discuss the position at Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam (see Jam news below). Objections were raised against the supposed growth of British influence on the Afghan frontier, and general opposition to the appointment of Shaji-us-Saltanah, who was described as an Anglophile, as Governor of Jam was displayed. Later a representative body from the meeting visited the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik, who seems to have dealt admirably with their protests. He pointed out to them that there was no question of the British at all but that he could not allow Government orders to be slighted and would on no account allow Shaukat-ud-Haulah to remain at Jam after his recent conduct. He informed the deputation plainly that he intended to reinstate Shaji, and they appear to have left his presence completely satisfied. This was the result of further intrigues on the part of Haji Husain Agha, as was a similar protest made by the local religious community headed by Aghazadah the leading mujtabid. The suffering which would inevitably be caused to the inhabitants of the Jam neighbourhood by the presence of a large body of troops in their midst during a time of scarcity was here the ground of protest, but the Mushawir was equally successful in dealing with it. He agreed with this deputation that it would be better not to send troops if it could be avoided, and consented to give Shaukat one more chance to come in. Fresh letter’s were then written to him by various people including the Aghazadah urging him to submit to Government, and it was agreed that should he not come within four days the troops would go. The Aghazadah inter viewed me on the 11th, and found that I also entirely agreed with him. It is not likely that Shaukat will come to Meshed, but Shaji will be reinstated which is what we want. 2. The Police Department have published a notice forbidding any person to carry arms in the town who is not a member of the Military or Police services. 3. Persian afairs {general). —The inhabitants of Tabas have telegraphed their thanks to the Home Office for the cancellation of orders which had Been issued dismissing their Governor, Salar Arfa’, with whom they are well contented. 4. The province generally is quiet, and firmness on the part of the Mmhawir-ul-Mumalik in connection with Jam affairs will help him to keep order elsewhere. 5. British ajjairs —Indian goods to the value of over two lakhs of rupees have come in during the past week. They consist mainly of sugar, indigo, and cotton cloth and chintz. 6. Russian affairs. —It appears that the question of M. Nicolsky’s transfer to Tehran has not yet been decided. During the week he has appealed to the Mushav)ir-ul-Mumalik, the Karguzar, and other influential people to give him assistance, and many telegrams have been sent to Tehran and possibly Petrograd urging the undesirability of his transfer. I have also been approached, though not by my colleague direct, and have replied that I can testify to the satisfactory relations that have existed between us but could scarcely do more than that. I hear that M. de Beauvais is trying to return as Secretary, and it is believed that he is intriguing against his late chief. 7. On account of recent disturbances in Tashkend there is renewed anxiety regarding possible looting on the part of Russian Cossacks here, and the towns people are concealing their valuable properties and making other preparations for emergency. 8 The Austrian prisoner (paragraph 14 last week) is still in the Nazmiah. My colleague informed me on the 11th instant that he had arranged to take him over. He has requested the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik to instruct all provin cial Governors to hand over any enemy prisoners they may make to the local0 Eussian agents, and asks that, should there be any objection to this procedure, the prisoners may invariably be made over to him on arrival in Meshed. 9. The Persian karpardaz (agent) at Askabad apparently fears some rising there of Eussian troops against his countrymen. Ee has telegraphed to the Poreign Office at Tehran informing them of his fears, which have not been allayed by a promise from the local Eussian Committee that nothing of the kind will occur, and asking whether, in case of emergency, he may obtain the services of Persian sowars from Daragez for the protection of his proteges. 10- Persian and German intrigues. — 'YSiq Ma tamid-ul-Wizarah^ whoso greatly profited in partnership with Kamran Mirza the late Governor-General by his connection with the sale of grain (paragraph 5 of Diary No. 34 and previous reports), has joined one party of the local democrats. As the majority cordially dislike him this wall probably lead to still further dissensions among them. 11. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —One Amir Khan, who caused the death of one of our hospital employes some time ago and was found not guilty of murder by an Askabad tribunal (he being a Eussian subject) has arrived at Turbat with an order from Kamran Mirza that he should be appointed an assistant to the local Police Superintendent. We are taking steps to prevent this appointment. 12. The post has been robbed half way between Turbat and Turshiz, and tumans 7,500 stolen. 13. A protest against the appointment of Jafar Khan as chief of Karasu- ran has been made to the Governor. It is alleged that he is himself the captain of a robber band. 14. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Possibly in the belief that Shau- kat-ud-Daulah is now firmly established as Governor of Jam the Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan have dispersed the greater number of their tribesmen (paragraph 18 last week). The Ilbaigi has gone to Jamrud, and Mir Baki is at Turbat. Shaukat has sent tumans 1,000 more to Meshed : our agent does not know for whom these are intended, but I have private infor mation that the greater number w r ere for the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik who has declined them. 15. News from Karez —Overtures have been made to the Governor Shuja-ul-Mulk by the Ilbaigi Kaudani, but they have been declined, and a mare wffiich had been sent with them has been returned; Shuja having no faith in the Ilbaigi’s professions of friendship. 16. It is also reported that Nusrat-ul-Mulk ^paragraph 19 last week) has reprimanded the Ilbaigi for his recent conduct. 17. News from Herat. —The usual Id ceremonial visits, etc., were carried out on the 28th ultimo, the occasion of Id-i-Kurban. 18. A report of mutiny by Eussian troops at Shaikh Junaid reached the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 1st instant. 19. The Naib-ul-Uukumah has recovered some of the property stolen by the Governors of Sabzawar and Anardarah (paragraph 28 of Diary No. 37), but has informed Ghulam Easul that the orders of the Amir are required for it to be returned to him. He is asked to come to Herat again in about three weeks time to receive the property. 20. It is reported that Wagner has supplied the Austrian members of his party and the man Ghulam Eiza with dresses worn by shepherds. They con sist of a shirt and trowsers of coarse country cloth, a felt coat, a long Afghan kullah and turban of cloth, wooden or skin shoes, and a false beard. Each person is also supplied with a staff and a bag to be carried on his back. Wagner photographed the party thus equipped: it is;said that they will try to escape disguised in this manner. Sistan and Birjand have been informed r 21. The two Turks whose arrival was so anxiously awaited by Kazim Beg (paragraph 30 of Diary IN o. 39) reached Herat on the 29th ultimo. The day following Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat-ullah took them to call on thecaii | ^nd g »i c t) lias anirfi be steps i diet ot |j|! belief lai I : Jam tie I number di ) to Jamh ) to Mh ive priTate cii Mumalil ill M) Naib-ul-'HnkumaTi and the Naib Salar. One is a captain named Sidik Beg: his description is given as tall, with black mustaches and no beard, two false front teeth. The other is a private soldier, also tall, of reddish complexion, thick mustaches and no heard. His name is Usman. 22. Wagner is reported to have withheld the wages of the servants Ghulam Biza and Saiyid Biza for a time, suspecting them of supplying news to the British Agent. Ghulam Biza, however, managed to persuade his master that he was guiltless, and received his pay on the 1st instant. 23. On the 2nd instant Asghar, Kazim Beg’s servant, enquired for English sovereigns in the bazar. He was only able to find two which he pur chased, at what rate is not stated. 24. On the 2nd an Afridi was brought to the Naib-ul-JS.u'kwnali who stated that he had been at Kirmanshah with the Turkish troops and had escaped to Tehran when the Bussians entered the town. He remarked that “many boxes of treasure fell into the water ” during the Turkish retreat from Kirmanshah. This man knows Hindustani: he appears to have been a sepoy of our army, possibly a deserter. 25. The Naib’ul-Eukumah is said to have remarked with some contempt that Kazim Beg, who was supposed to be a brave soldier, was more afraid of the cholera than anyone else. 26. Sidik Beg (paragraph 21 above) is said to have stated that he and his companions were 7 in number when they escaped from Bussia, and that the other five, three of whom were Austrians and two Germans, were recaptured. He added that the two Germans were hanged on recapture, which is scarcely likely to be true. W. G.

(1) It is reported that two “ Germans of very, fair complexion, wearing mendicants’ garb of very superior quality, arrived in Deh Brigad (the Afghan Brigadier’s residence) near Nad-i-Ali on the 17th October. They climbed two hillocks, looked at some ruins, and did some sketching. (2) Three military officers of high rank recently reached Herat from Kabul. Two of them belong to the Afghan Supply Department. It seems that some of the “ Germans ” mentioned in recent Diaries as passing through farah are identical with these Afghans who wear uniforms of European style. Bazaar News. Various rumours are floating about the town to the effect that some Persian Ministers have been assassinated in Tehran, and that a fresh Cabinate has been formed. I Cholera in Kainat.

The Serishtadar of Chakhansur, Saiyid Kazim, has fallen into disgrace and left the district for Farah. It is reported that at Shaneh, between Chakhansur and Farah, he met some “ Germans ” who offered him service as a news-writer. It is not known where the Saiyid has gone since. His description is as follows age 50, complexion red, medium height, beard dyed black, hitherto dressed in Khaki drill. The “ Germans ” went on to Kala-i-Kang and Bandar Kamal Khan. No 'Other news about them has been received this week. \ British deserters. An Indian, calling himself Ghulam Husain Khan, son of Sher Khan of Sibi Dhadar in Baluchistan, was arrested by His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s sowars at Majnabad, and has been handed over to the Officer Commanding British troops at Birjand. The prisoner admits having served in the llthXabour Corps at Baghdad. He was making for Afghanistan. News from Afghanistan. (1) 700 breech-loading rifles reached Kala-i-Kang from Farah during Sep tember. This is perhaps the consignment alluded to in Diary No. 30. A Company of Infantry and 2 guns reached Kala-i-Kang at or about the same time. (2) In Jijeh near Sabzawar there has been some fighting between Abdul Ghafur Khan of Adraskan and Abdur Eahman Khan Nurzai. (3) Kadkhuda Kundil of Kang-i-Din Muhammad near Nad-i-Ali has migrated from Afghanistan to Sharifabad (Sistan) with 100 (?) households. He was in arrears with his revenue. Gun-running. Belal Kharot of Milak is said to have sold 25 rifles, which he brought to Sistan from Kerman a few months ago, to Sardar Muhammad Aslam Khan of Rezai, Governor of Khash Bud. Suspicious travellers. On the 2nd instant four strangers dressed as Arabs and speaking an unintelli gible language appeared in Fa^re^h where they were arrested on suspicion by the Ghulams of the Telegraph Department. Lieutenant Dormer arranged for them to be taken into Bam under an escort sent out _ by the Deputy Governor. It has since transpired that the men are Arabs (Shiah) from Kulvan near Shiraz, who on account of the scarcity of food had taken their families (twenty in number) and flocks to Narmashir, and thence had ccme themselves to Fahreh to beg. %G, M.

He came to Benadir in Garmsel and was told that he would not be able to cross our line. He talked of either proceeding or returning on the 16th October. The drought in Sistan. The Karguzar (Acting Deputy Governor) of Sistan accompanied .by the Bevenue Officer and other local officials left the city on the 6th instant and proceeded to the border in Mian Kangi. On the 9th October he met the Afghan Governor, the Acting Sarhaddar (Kumedan Sher Muhammad Khan), the Kazi and other officials and notables of Chakhansur. The Karguzar paid the first call, as Sardar Gul Muhammad Khan claimed to be a Prince of the Blood Boyah' ' I ( ,— The combined party inspected the two bands Pariyun and Kuhak. The proceedings and settlement were amicable, though doubts are expressed by the kadkhudas of Sistan as to the Afghans abiding by the latter. The Persian party returned to Sistan on the 12th. Indian suspects. f) , See Diary No. 26. On the 7th August I received an account from the North- f West Frontier Province about Hakim Muhammad Ha|pin which indicated that he was harmless. On his being released he stayed in Sistan a short while only and then returned to Afghanistan. I hear that as soon as his presence in Chakhansur was detected he was arrested and subjected to a flogging ; he subsequently gained his release by producing evidence of his employment as a secret news agent of the Amir. He could, in my opinion, have given us more news of Afghan affairs than he did. Cholera in Kainat. During the week 15 fresh cases and 15 deaths have been reported from Birjand. Four fresh cases and one death were reported from Shusp on the 13th. Fifteen cases and 5 deaths are said to have occurred at Hamand near Shusp, probably during a period of some days. Lieutenant Brenan is progressing satisfactorily. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain.'S- 10 M Nioolsky lias sent a strong message to the Karguzar saying that M. Kaal his assistant complained that he did not help them as he helped the British Com - Sll l ate i n the settlement of cases, and that if matters did not improve he would be obliged to report to Tehran against him. The Karguzar sent a spirited reply f denying that he made any difference in his dealings with the Consulates, and suggesting that M. Nicolsky should see him and M. Kaal at work and judge for himself of the extent to which Kaal had cause to complain. (Both sides confided in me The fact is that M. Kaal’s ideas of justice are that all cases should be given in favour. of the Russian subjects, who must be m the right, and the « Karguzar finds the difference when he works with us.) 11 Persian and German intrigues. —At the weekly meeting of the democrat society’ the misconduct of the Russian Cossacks above referred to was discussed at great length, and various proposals were made for dealing with it. Some extremists suggested that a rising should be orgamsed, and others that selected members of the “ Terrorists ,r should be appointed to murder any Cossack who might be detected in an act of oppression. The majority of those present, however, were agreed that it would be best to wait for a time and watch the result of the measures already taken in the matter. The Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah was then discussed, and general regret was expressed that the society had been so deceived by him ; various proposals being made for his punishment (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 34). A letter from Malik-ush-Shura was then read. The writer bewails the dissension which has been sown among democrats in 1 ehran by the intrigues of the British and Russians, and exhorts to unity and dilligence. 12 News from Turhat-i-Haidari.—^ death of M, Mikhailoff on the 14th instant from heart failure following an attack of cholera is reported. The funeral was not attended by M. Antipoff. 13. The cholera in Turbat is reported to have ceased. 14. Nemsfrom Turhat-i-Shaikh Jam.—On the 16th instant we received inform- a f.ion that Shaukat-ud-Daulah had arrested and imprisoned his brother Shaji-us- Saltanah at Kila Ghak, some fifteen miles from Turbat, and later, that he had taken possession of all his property and plundered his house at Mahmudabad. About the same time the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik received a letter from Amjad-ul-Mulk, the leader of the deputation sent to Jam (paragraph 23 last week), saying that he was powerless to act owing to the strength of the Shaukat-Ilbaigi party. My colleague and I paid a joint visit to the Mushawir urging strong action, and the question of sending a force of Russian Cossacks to Jam is under consideration. Meanwhile there is a rumour that Shaji has escaped from confinement and is on his way to Meshed. 15. Nems from Karez .—Shuja-ul-Mulk is still prepared for eventualities, as he places no trust in the Ilbaigi’s professions of friendship (paragraph 26 last week). He has sent me a message of thanks for the steps taken to restrain the Ilbaigi. 16. News from Herat.—The Naih-ul-Hukumah intends to withdraw all Khawanin sowars from the frontier stations to the town, and to replace them by military sowars under the orders of the Naib Salar. 17. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered the imprisonment of 22 Jamshidis who have been sent in from Chihil Dukhtaran by Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan with the information that they had been expelled from Russian territory for robbery. (This is evidently the party of whose depredations reports have recently been received here.) 18. Eight Heratis have been sent in from Bala Murghab with the report that they have been deported by the Russians, to whos§ territory they had gone to find work. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has fined each 100 krans for having left the country without a passport. 19. Risaldar Yar Muhammad has purchased and sent in to the Naib Salar from the frontier four kharwars of iron. 20. One hundred of the Baluchis who had previously emigrated from Qhakhansur to Russian territory have returned, and are allowed to proceed to Chakhansur on security that they will not again leave the country.21. The arrival at Bala Murghab of two Turks, apparently an officer and hia servant, is reported. The Governor detained them pending orders from the Naibul-Hukumah, and a letter written by the officer to Kazim Beg was brought into Herat. This letter Kazim read to the Naib. It stated that the writer was an officer of the Turkish Government who had come to Bokhara on the pretext of trading : and that he wished to see him as soon as possible. The A aib'id-Hukuivuih has sent orders for this man, who signs himself “ Hassan Effendi,” to be brought in to Herat, and Kazim is shewing some eagerness to meet him. 22. Nasrullah states that Petrograd has been occupied by German troops, but he is not believed on account of the many false reports for which he had previously been responsible. He has made during the week ending the 14th instant some purchases and other preparations for departure. 23. Our Agent heard on the 10th that Mahendra Partap had written to Kazim Beg announcing his approaching departure from Mazar-i-Sharif. He does not say where he is going. 24. On the 13th instant Wagner weighed his outfit with a view to ascertain how many mule loads there would be. Bayerl is also said to have made full preparations for a journey, and it is generally reported that the Germans make no secret of their hope to leave before long. 25. On the 14th Wagner requested the Naib-ul-Hukumah to allow hi» party to bring their fodder and provisions from the town to Bagh-i-Kartah on his mules, giving out that he wished to make them fit for travelling. Permission was granted by the Naib. 26. It seems that the article mentioned in paragraph 35 of Diary No. 33 was not taken from a newspaper, but is a private publication prepared by one Ghulam Nabi expressly for consumption by the Amir, and pubhshed in India but I have not been able to discover in what town. The copy of which our Agent sends a precis was sent from Kabul by the Sipali Salar for the information of the Naib Solar. The object of the article appears to be to cause an impression by contrast ing the terms on which the pro-peace party are prepared to close the war with those which will ultimately be laid down by the Central Powers. The former include a no-indemfnity and no-annexation clause but &lt;fcre careful to provide for the ejection of the Turks from Europe and annexation of the German colonies in Africa : and the latter demand the occupation of all British ports of importance until a heavy indemnity has been paid, and the permanent possession by Germany of Northern France, all British ships of war, iron and coal mines and steel factories. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. Meshed : The 22nd September 1917. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C 416 E.D.— 20-10-17—30—E A.CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 39 for the week ending the 29th September 1917. 1. Persian officials. —Kamran Mirza called on the 25th instant to say good-bye. The date of his departure to Tehran is not yet fixed. 2. Dabir-ul-Mumalik has relieved Prince Firuz-ud-Daulah, son of Kamran Mirza, of his duties as head of the Governor-General’s office. The Dabir has been appointed by Tehran to this post. 3. Husain Kuli, to whose appointment my Colleague objected on account of his supposed pro-German sympathies, has, after all, been posted as Chief of Police. We have nothing against this man, and M. Nicolsky has said nothing to me, so he may have withdrawn his objection, which is based upon mere rumour so far as we know. 4. Several telegrams have been despatched to the Mustaufi-ul-Mumalih and others in Tehran by various parties and individuals here, asking for Naiyur-ud- Daulah to be appointed Governor-General of Khorassan. He was dismissed last year at the instance of the Consulates-General for refusing to pay compensation in certain cases of robbery from British and Russian subjects. However he was undoubtedly a stronger Governor than either of the two men who have since occupied the post, and has recently made overtures to us for assistance. Perhaps he might be given another chance : one interesting feature in his case is that the democrats are strongly opposed to his return to Khorassan. Meanwhile the Mushawir-ul-MumaWc is striving to ingratiate himself with all parties with a view to secure the permanent post. 5. Persian affairs (local). —Haji Husain Agha, the protector and patron of certain robber bands in this neighbourhood and without exception the most trouble some person in the place, sent out during the week a confidential servant to bring in the Zuchki and Shikari gangs which have recently been active on the Chinaran road, etc., giving them a promise of free pardon on condition that they would submit to be disarmed. In response to this invitation about 60 men came in, the number including the well-known chief Muhammad Zabi-ullah, but it is believed that any result that has ensued will last only so long as the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik consents to be guided in all important matters by Haji Husain Agha. 6. No further cases of cholera have occurred, and the outbreak in this neighbourhood has come to an end. 7. Persian affairs (general).- —Highway robberies are reported fromKhaf, where the new Governor has not yet succeeded in restoring law and order. 8. Shuja-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, telegraphs to the Home Office that as he has given the robber Khuddu a pardon on promise of good conduct the Chief of Bujnurd should now be told to desist from efforts to capture him. Khuddu has also telegraphed to the Minister complaining against the Chief, and asking that if he has not been pardoned a notice may be given to him to that effect so that he may know how to act in future. 9. It is still reported that Khuddu is at Khakistar (paragraph 9 Diary No. 37), and the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has received orders from Tehran to capture him without fail. 10. Telegrams have also been despatched to Tehran from representative bodies of the inhabitants of Chinaran and Turbat-i-Haidari urging the reappoint ment of Naiyur-ud-Daulah as Governor-General as he alone can maintain order and protect life and property (paragraph 4 above). 11. British affairs. —Indian goods to the value of krans 760,000 (nearly two lakhs of rupees at 40 krans to the 15 rupees) have arrived in Meshed during the past ten days, These consist of sugar, cotton thread and cloth, and indigo.2, 12 Russian affairs—U. Nioolsky informed me that he had been offered the post of Consul-General at Tehran and asked whether I would advise him to accept it I asked how the post compared with this one. Me replied that it had some additional advantages but that the late incumbent of the post had found the work since the revolution both difficult and unpleasant, and he personally felt more inclined to remain here where there was comparatively no trouble. 13. An Austrian escaped prisoner has been brought m from Daragez an d im prisoned in the Nazmiah. My colleague has arranged with the Karguzar that he shall be sent off to Tehran in a post carriage, and then captured by Russian Cossacks at Sharifabad ! By this manoeuvre it is hoped to protect the local authorities from falling foul of the democrats. 14. Further misbehaviour by Cossacks is reported (paragraph 4 last week). On the night of the 22nd instant a party of seven attacked the private residence of the Superintendent of Post Offices. They failed to effect an entrance however. 15. Persian and German —Dissensions continue among the demo crats, chiefly on account of the desire of many that Hap Muhammad Ja r shou mflonger be their leader. The election of a leader by ballot has been suggested. 16. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—The presence of a gang of Afghan robbers near Rabat-i-Kamai is reported. The Local Government has received orders from Tehran to deal with them. • 17. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.-Shaji-us-Saltanah arrived at Meshed on the 23rd instant, having escaped from confinement with the help of a loyal attendant. Mv colleague and I sent him to the Mushamr-ul-Mumahk with instructions to relate to him all his recent experiences. The Mushamr arranged to send a military expedition to Jam, but as we heard that this party was to be under the command of Prince Saham-ul-Mulk, a creature of Hap Hussain Agha (paragraph d above), it was thought best to ask the Persian Government to sanction the despatch of a force from the Persian Cossack Brigade ; and M. bicolsky, Colonel Mamanoff, the Commandant, and I, all telegraphed to Tehran on the subject Meanwhile Haii Husain Agha, to whose intrigues there is no limit, induced the Mushauir to cancel his orders regarding the despatch of troops, and to allow him to mvi e Shaukat-ud-Daulah (paragraph 14 last week) to Meshed on a promise of safety. We are now awaiting an answer to our reference to Tehran and the arrival ot bhaukat at Meshed. Late news -states that the brother and nephew of the man who assisted Shaji to escape have been killed, but in what exact circumstances is not yet known. 18 I have received a reply from the Ilbaigi Kaudani to my letter k) him (paragraph 23 of Diary No. 37)/ He denies having any intention to attack Karez : renews his accusations against Shuja-ul-Mulk of being the cause of all the trouble suffered by him at the hands of the Russians two years ago ; complains that-no action has been taken by the Government of Khorassan to enquire into his grievances . and represents that no Afghan malefactor has taken refuge with him. e e er closes with expressions of loyalty to the Allies. 19. News from Karez. —Mirza Jalal Khan, the Customs Officer in Karez, is transferred to Kuchan. He is being replaced by Prince Ahmad Mirza. 20. News from Herat.—The outbreak of cholera is reported, and all necessary arrangements to combat it are being made by the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who has prohibited the sale of fruit for the present, 21. On September 16th a man from one of the neighbouring villages was stoned to death by order of the Naib-ul-Hukumah in pursuance of a sentence pro nounced upon him by a religious court where he has been found guilty of abusing the. Khalifs. 22. The Austrian known as “ Mirza ” made a plan of part of the town of Herat on the 15th instant. 23 Kazim Beg visited the Naib Solar cn the same day and complained that the Afghan Government did not shew respect to their guests in that nothing wasdone to prevent the British Agent at Herat making reports to Meshed which resulted in their friends being captured. He spoke with special reference to the Turkoman Sirdar, the departure of whom from Herat was reported in Diary No. 37, paragraph 27, and expressed fear lest he should be arrested. The Naib replied that the Sirdar had returned to his own country with the approval of the Russian Government and that the British had nothing to do with him ; there Was therefore on cause for anxiety. ^ 24. Wagner’s servant Abbas Ah complaind to the Naib Salar because a sepoy was sent with him as escort when* he visited the town on the 15th instant, saying that they were not prisoners and had therefore no need of escorts on every occasion. The Naib replied that the escort was sent merely to prevent disrespect towards the party from the townspeople. 25. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has allowed Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkatullah to reside in Bagh-i-Shah outside the town while the cholera exists, and has pro vided for their being well guarded while there. 26. Kazim Beg demanded more furniture from the Naib-ul-Hukumah on_ the 18th, for their new quarters, but was told that they must be content with what they have. 27. Wal^r has given strict orders to his people not to visit the town at present, but allows Nasrullah to go for the purpose of spreading false news, and to bring information to him. On the 19th Nasrullah gave out that the Russian Government would cease to exist in about a fortnight, and that the war would then terminate. 28. The Naib Salar rejected a request by Waiiger that their guards should not be changed during the cholera visitation, saying that military regulations could not be affected by such circumstances. ' 29. A recent arrival at Herat from Mazar-i-Sharif confirms the news regard ing Mahendra Pertab. According to this informant he reached Mazar on the 4th July and intends shortly to undertake another journey, in what direction is not stated. He is apparently treated with great respect, being liberally supplied with escorts by the local authorities. 30. Ou,r Agent makes no mention this week of the Turks whose arrival at Herat was so anxiously awaited by Kazim Beg (paragraph 21 last week). Enquiry will be made from him. Meshed : A W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, C His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and The 29th September 1917. J Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. * • CL M. Press,'Simla*—No. 0129 F.D.—3110-17 30 E.A. /intelligence Summary Number 37 for the week ending the 15th September 1917. Khorasan and North-East Persia. 43 6 - Russian force. —The Military Agent, Colonel Skuratt, is leaving for Petrograd on business, and will probably be absent from i to 2 months. No further details regarding the attack on the 29th August on the escort to the Indian prisoners near Amrani have been received. The prisoners duly reached Birjand at the end of last week. Adal-ad-Daulah, Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari, when serving in the same capacity in 1913, entertained a local gang of brigands, who, among other feats, attacked the Consular escort relief on its way to Meshed, and rumours ascribing similar conduct to him have been current recently. He was also in 1915 inti mate with the Germanophile Karguzar of Meshed, Muazzaz-ad-Daulab, who fled the place to escape arrest for his activities in arranging the escape to Persia of Austrian prisoners of war, and who has lately been reported to be intriguing to return in his former appointment; and a photograph is in our possession of a group of escaped Austrian officers at Meshed which includes these two worthies. The main object in life of Adal-ad-Daulah is no doubt the lining of his pocket but attacks on posts, escorts, etc., in his jurisdiction are subject to more suspicion than in the case of a governor who had had no dealings with German supporters, and the attention of the Russians has been drawn to this aspect of the case. 437. Jamshedis -—The Tashkent General Staff have at last replied to en quiries as to the whereabouts of Sayyid Ahmad Beg. They state that he left Samarkand in May for Chaman-i-Bid, no doubt owing to the relaxation with regard to political suspects ensuing on the Russian revolution. He has, they say, more than once made himself useful in furnishing Afghan information, and owing to this and the fact that he now has a numerous family with him, they do not consider it probable that he was concerned in the doings of the Jamshedi band which has been committing a series of robberies on the Russo-Afghan and Perso*Russian frontiers, and of which 19 members were captured by Russian frontier troops on the 15th August and conveyed to Kushk to await trial. They do not, however, appear to be in a position to state the fact positively, and having regard to the position of Chaman-i-Bid, his previous record, and the statements of various persons as to his recent presence at places on the Persian frontier, it seems quite possible that Sayyid Ahmad has with some success been running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. As noted last week, however, it is with his possibilities as the creator of a political incident and not with his activities as a d'industrie that we are concerned, and from one cause and another it seems reasonably safe to discount the former. 438. Local affairs .—Owing to somewhat acute manifestations of discon tent with his misrule, the early retirement of the Governor-General, Kamran Mirza Naib-as-Saltanah, seems probable. Hjs successor will have no easy task in remedying the universal disorder in which the province has been plunged. The boldness of robbers has recently been shewn by the holding-up of the representative of a Russian firm not far from the Russian post at Gunabad, some 20 miles only from Meshed on the Askhabad road. This gentleman was relieved of 2,500 roubles and various property. Cholera in the city appears to be dying out, but the disease may be expected for some time yet to make its appearance at various points in the province. Rumours of cases in Russian territory near Dushakh, and also in Bokhara have not been confirmed, but may possibly be true. A 6-days quarantine is said to have been instituted at Bajgiran, and on caravan routes from Meshed to2 ,L*s*+~-iJ~ Russian territory. Kbaddu, the robber, has been attending with some assiduity to traffic on the Kahka road, but according to latest reports, has transferred his activities to the neighbourhood of Quchan. Russian paper reports cholera at Astrabad. A bacteriologist from Tashkent was sent there some time ago, but failed to establish the fact of the disease. After his departure unmistakable cases are said to have occurred. Herat and Afghanistan. 439. Germans and adherents .—The nervousness of the Herat Germans regarding spies increases. Any stranger approaching the Bagh-i-Kartah is liable to^arrest on suspicion, and Wagner has recently procured the dismissal of the gardeners as possible sources of leakage of information. Wagner has obtained a loan of 5,000 krans from the Government treasury, and the sale of two horses is locally ascribed to lack of funds. The Naib Salar has acceded to his request to be furnished with a plan of Herat city. Abbas Ali Isfahan! (Number 16 on list appended to Int. Sum. Number 6) has purchased 6 golden ashrafis, saying that their portability commended itself to him. According to rumours Wagner expects the return of Abdurrahman Khan, and is somewhat concerned at his non-appearance. He credits him, however, with ability to escape arrest en route. Anti-ally propaganda continues, and Kazim Beg has again criticised to his escort the Amir’s British policy without, apparently, carrying conviction. Two Turks, one of whom is said to be a doctor, have reached Herat from Russia. The successful escape of 3 Austrians from Kabul is rumoured. The Turkoman Sardar, Kurban Muhammad (Junaid), left for Russian terri tory via Zulfiqar on the 5th September. 440. Training .—The work of the Herat garrison which has been in abeyance since the beginning of Ramazan, has now to some extent been resumed. Field practices are undertaken daily by one company per battalion. Three field guns and three mountain guns are horsed, and drill, said to be preparatory to field firing, is carried out. The stable authorities are complaining that the working of the horses, whose daily forage has been reduced to 2 mans of chopped straw and 3-8 man of barley, can only result in loss of condition. 441. Frontier .—Complaints of oppression of the civil population by an officer in charge of the troops near Chakcharan having been received, he has been replaced in his command, and his despatch to Herat in chains has been ordered. On the receipt of news of the serious illness of Rissaldar Yar Muhammad at Chihil Dukhtaran, a litter was despatched to bring him to Herat for treatment, and his son—Muhammad Zaman Khan—appointed to carry on bis duties. A report on the caravansarais on roads to front ers from Herat, and on the amounts of forage in stock there, has been entrusted to certain selected khawanm. 442. Russian intelligence .— Last week M. Bulatov, Russian Vice-Consul at Birjandf telegraphed to all and sundry the reputed death of the Amir and the assumption of control by Inayatullah Khan. (Reference paragraph 389.) He now telegraphs that according to English information the report is incorrect. He has also “discovered” the existence of the order for conscription of 1 per 8 males of the population (according to him 1 per 7), to which he has given the same general publicity. The Military Agent states that he has rendered periodical reports on this subject for the last 7 years. He considers M. Bulatov’s alarmist reports harmful for various reasons, and it is probable that he will make represen tations on the subject both at Tashkent and Petrograd. Russian Turkistan. 443. Current affairs .—The order of the Provisional Government for the institution of local self-government throughout Turkistan is published in the Turkistan News of the 2nd September. Apart from districts affected, the followingf) ^ (k Missal 5 j| 3gaia cnfe: g comii cd talk loorei, rRiissib minak* resmi i Hireeip ;ratorj (a i at tie ii? dio^its Melaoi! for trails liis da®'* ontleawf 3 00' 3 towns have been granted independent constitutions: Tashkent, Askhabad, Samarkand, Khojent, Skobelev, Old Margilan, Namangan, Andijan, and Osh The supplies question remains acute. The Syr Darya Supplies Committee has telegraphed to the President of the National Council at Moscow that owing to restrictions on import of grain Irom Russia, an amount sufficient only for 30 per cent of the population of the province is being received. The people are now consuming their last available ford-stuffs of all sorts, and in the absence of early measures, famine and its attendant disorders may be expected. The lowest monthly estimate of the necessary grain is placed at 1,200,000 /&gt;uds (20,000 tons). The 2 million /&gt;uds, expected from the Caucasus, is said to be in course of despatch through Petrovsk. An occurrence on the 31st August is reported from Tashkent which is not 1 without disquieting symptoms. A deputation of Kirghiz from Semirechia waited on the Turkistan Committee to call attention to the continuance of outrages, many of them involving bloodshed by Russians on the local Kirghiz, particu larly in and around Prjevalsk. While reassurances of prompt measures of relief were being given to the petitioners, a demonstration of some 1,500 to 2,000 Sarts, led and organised by Tartar soldiers, appeared on the scene, and with some violence demanded immediate energetic action. The assurances of M. Nalivkin and his colleagues were greeted with considerable scepticism. The demonstra tors stated that had Russian and not Kirghiz lives been involved very different action would have been taken by the authorities. They agreed to await results, but said that in the absence of satisfaction, the 35 millions of Russian Musalmans would know 7 how to take matters into their own hands. Commenting on the incident, the Turkistan News characterises the demon stration with the exception of the Tartars and some “ Hooligans ” in the crowd as of a peaceful nature. In spite of prohibitions, there is evidently a good deal of smuggling to Persia. Recently an Armenian smuggling medicines was reported to have been killed by Frontier Guards, and the papers report the capture just short of the Persian frontier (presumably Gaucian) of 7 fourgons laden with iron and other prohibited goods of an estimated value of 70,000 roubles. They had already passed the customs and other posts, and were only discovered by the chance appearance of an officer who called for their papers. In spite of the official re-opening of the frontier on the 15th August, prac tically no letters or newspapers for Meshed are passing Askhabad. Natives complain of the same treatment as regards telegrams, and state that communica tions for Russia are also detained at Askhabad. 444. Turkomans .—A new committee of Trans-Caspian Turkomans, includ ing 17 members, has been formed under the leadership of Colonel Oraz Sardar of the Turkoman Cavalry Regiment, whose temporary liberation from military duties has been reques f ed. i here appears to be little amelioration of Turkoman frontier lawlessness, and a number of quarrels involving bloodshed are reported in Turko man settlements. 445. Railways .—With regard to the Arys Vyerni Semirechia railway, the Turkistan News states that, from the commencement of the ensuing year it is proposed considerably to reduce the present construction staff, and to proceed to exploit, by passenger and goods traffic, the section Arys-Aulieata already com pleted. Under favourable circumstances in the spring construction on the sections Pishpek-Vyerni, Pishpek-Tokmak and Aulieata-Pishpek will, however, be proceeded with. The two statements appear somewhat contradictory in view of the proposed reduction of construction staff.* &gt; 8 1917 SECRET 3 Intelligence Summary Number 38 for the week ending the 22hd September 1917. 446. Russian During the week a rumour has been increasing in strength that the Russian Cossacks intend to foot the town, and considerable alarm prevails. Colonel Gustchin states that for some days past he has heard the report for which there is not the slightest foundation, the discipline of the men being as satisfactory as revolutionary conditions permit. It is quite pro bable that the report has been spread by mischievous persons, and the name of Hajji Hussain Agha, a most mischievous intriguer, has been mentioned more than once in this connection. ^ According to latest information this individual is arranging for ioo “secret” riflemen to guard his house ard that of some others at night. Democrats are said to have despatched a lengthy telegram to Tehran on the subject, and the “80th Division ^ to have 25 riflemen in readiness for emergencies. The news of the pardon of the 5 Cossacks arrested for the murder of the guard at the Maliyat early in the year has reached Meshed, and cannot fail to have produced an unfortunate impression, but, according to Colonel Gtlstchin the Cossacks themselves are ind gnant at this and have insisted that under no* circumstances should the men be allowed to return to the regiment which they have disgraced. 447. yawsVWzs.—Herat reports the arrival at Bala Murghab in custody of some 20 Jamshedi robbers deported from Russia. Orders have been sent for their despatch to Herat where they will be imprisoned in chains. These are evidently the men whose capture by the Russians was noted last week. 448. Prisoners and suspects —hxxwehs from Kahka informed me last week that 5 Austrian prisoners had escaped on the 13th instant to Kbakistar. Three were recaptured but the remaining two were at large and were said to be making for Meshed, The Russians were informed, and one man—-apparently belonging to the medical corps—is a prisoner at the Nazmiah. During the week the presence of an individual attempting to dispose of Austrian notes was reported. _ He was brought to the Consulate-General, and proved to be a native of Mazar-i Sharif who had been employed (as his docu ments attested) at the Kizil Ki coal mines in Turkistan up to a year ago. As, however, he gave an obviously untrue account of his occupation during the last year, and there were other suspicious circumstances, he was handed over to the Russian Consulate General for further investigation of his antecedents. 449. Local affairs.—The resignation of the Governor-General, Kamran Mirza, has been accepted, and he is expected to leave foe Tehran at an early date. Mushawir-al-Mamalik, the Assistant Governor-General, replaces him on a temporary basis. The country in general swarms with robbers and the im provement of conditions will take time tinder the most favourable circumstances. Both the Khaf and Jam Districts remain in disorder. In the latter Shaukat- ad-Daulah, assisted by the Kaudani Ilbaigi, recently made prisoner of Shajji- as-Saltanah, his brother, and fears for the latter’s safety were entertained. He has, however, escaped and has reached Meshed. The whole affair, which there is excellent reason to suppose was arranged and financed by Hajji Hussain Agha, supplies a glaring example of official weakness and corruption. Without entering into the local aspects of the case, the net result remains 1 that throughout the Jam frontier belt in place of the loyal Shajji who has given us valuable help in the past, all practical power lies in the hands of the Ilbaigi-— deported by the Russians on strong suspicion of affording help to the German mission on their passage to Afghanistan, and after his escape from Russia when at Herat in touch with the German party—-and of Shaukat, who in view of English and Russian opposition to his assumption of the Governorship, can hardly be expected to regard our interests,. * Khorasan and North East PersiaIt is probable that with the removal of Hajji Hussain Agha the whole intrigue would collapse. Unfortunately, he is a Russian protege : the Russian Consul-Gene- ral cannot be induced to take action against him, and this fact lies the hands of the Persian authorities apart from any other disinclination to move. Cholera in the city is apparently at an end, though cases are still reported from the districts. M. Mikhailov, late Russian Consul at Turbat i-Haidan, fell a victim to the disease at that place. H.rat and Afghanistan. Germar.sand adherents—Wagner is exercising his mules to harden them for the road, is arranging convenient loads, and has purchased lambskin ‘ kullahs” for wear by the Austrians. The reason of all this is not yet clear. Probably they believe the report of the capture of Petrograd and perhaps con- sider Russian resistance at an end, but on a former occasion when they thought that Russia was concluding a separate peace their intention was to reach the Russian frontier with Afghan transport, and to dispose of their own ani ’ T,aiS It is therefore possible that they contemplate another route altogether should cir cumstances prove favourable for departure The two Turks noted last week have not yet reached Herat, but were detain ed at Bala Murghab pending the receipt of an answer to a letur which the principal one despatched to Kazim Beg. The latter was thrown in to a great flutter by the letter the writer being apparently a Turkish official of some importance J) a ^ e d Hassan Effendi who had arrived from Bokhara on business of im P°yt. Orders were sent that the guest was to be sent forward with all honour and Kazim Beg with his escort several times went out to meet him. He had not arrived up to the date of despatch of the latest report. A letter from Mohendro Par tap has been received by Kazim Beg, in which the probability of a further journey by the writer is mentioned. The German party have been giving expert advice on trench-digging and are evidently flattering the Naib Salar to the top of his bent. 451. Military affairs .—The relief of the artillery detachment at Ghurian, and their return to Herat fdr further training has been ordered. The signalling instructor has been promoted to captain and posted to the Logari battalion, and further encouragement held out the signallers. The range finding class has been ordered to be ready for examination. A deported soldier who returned to Herat has been confined in chains pend- ing his return to Kabul for severe punishment. 45?. Khavnnin .—The Naib-ul-Hukuinah has ordered that khavamn stationed on the Bala Murghab, Khushk, and Gulran frontiers be relieved by regular cavalry under the orders of the Naib Salar. A detachment o khavardnis to be ready for despatch to Kabul. 453. Grain collection.—?r\x\6^\\ land-owners were summoned by the Naib Salar and ordered to pay in their arrears of revenue grain within one month to the military store. Urgency is evidently attached to the measure as failure to comply will be met by the employment of military force and other penalties. The matter will be watched. Russian Turkistan. 454. Current affairs .— In connection with General Kornilov’s actions, a special Council, consisting of members of the Turkistan Committee, Military com manders, and members of the various committees, has been formed to deal with any outward’developments which might arise. Assurance of loyalty to the Pro visional Government coupled with the statement that all was quiet (up to 15th September) were sent. Special measures have been taken to guard railways ana telegraphs, and all troops—except those on service at Khiva—instructed to obey no commands for military action unless confirmed by the Workmen an Soldier's Committees. clu hi! T 1All open air meetings were prohibited from the 5th to 7th September in clusive at Tashkent, and a local Committee of Public Safety was formed. Pro hibition of access by civil and military to the railway premises was also issued. These latter measures were apparently called forth by indiscriminate waylaying of supplies, and had no political significance. Crime is again on the increase in Tashkent, and frequent robberies are noted at Askhabad. Turkistan Musctlmans.--Co\on£\ Gustchin has just received a copy of a j circular telegram addressed to all commanders of garrisons in Turkistan by the General Officer Commanding the Turkistan Military District, informing them that Sarts and other natives are obtaining arms, and enjoining on them the greatest vigilance with regard to their own garrisons and the attitude of the native in their vicinity. Indications of growing discontent among Turkistan Musalmans have been noted in these summaries from time to time, although the above is the first official recognition of any actual danger. Although the disorders over the labour conscription last year were directed against the late regime^ Russians and natives were in conflict. Probably bitterness has remained in other parts of Turkistan and in the Khivan Khanate, but it is very certain that the acute hostility between the Russians and Kirghiz in Semirechia, which still continues, is deeply resented by other races of Turkistan Musalmans. Actual distress from food scarcity is a disturbing factor which unsettled conditions in Russia can only tend to increase, and we may be certain that enemy agents are doing their best to exploit the favourable ground, the complete disorganisation of the detective and police force being ail in their favour. The arrival of a Turkish agent in Afghanistan from Bokhara is a case in point. While it may be hoped that vigilance may avert, or rip in the bud, any actual disorder, the conclusion that it is very necessary at the present juncture can hardly be avoided. 455. Semitechia .—The Turkistan Committee hope to realise the grant by the Provisional Government of 11 million rubles to deal with distress both among Russians and Kirghiz in the province. Numbers of the latter are reported to be dying of hunger and typhus, and a member of the Committee with a staff of doctors and legal officials—the latter in connection with the disorders round Prjevalsk—are being despatched. 456. Military .—The 1st Siberian Rifle Reserve Regiment at the front has sent an appeal to Tashkent asking that all officers and other ranks employed as representatives, etc., may be ordered to rejoin in view of the dearth of officers for duty. According to the papers the principal units in garrison at Tashkent at present are the depot detachments of the istand 2nd Siberian R. R. Regiments, the 737th Siberian Militia, and the Escort Corps.

The Director has been out to various villages including Deh Masti Khan and Jezinak, confiscating rifles, opium and aniline dyes all of which have been recently imported from Kerman. Cholera in Kainat. During the week eight fresh cases and nine deaths have been reported from, Bujd and its suburb, one fatal case from Shaukatabad, six cases and two deaths from Birjand and three fatal cases from Mud. On the 18th instant a party of 12 men under orders from the Deputy Governor of Bam arrived at Nasratabad Sipeh from Fahreh to prevent Sistanis proceeding to German.

(2) It is said that a General is coming to Kala-i-Kang in relief of Brigadier Gulam Ahmad Khan. (3) It is said that Mohiyucldin Khan Madizai of Khusp (near Farah), who had attacked a British convoy near Hauz-i-Nimeh about 18 months ago, when four of his followers were killed, is contemplating a renewal of hostilities. He has sent a spy to inspect our posts between Bandan and Duroh. He commands 30 men and covets our rides. (4) Another reporter states that Majnun Khan of Bakwa also contemplates attacking our convoys between Lab-i-Baring and Bandan, using Kharika as his base. He is said to have a following of 60 men. (5) The Afghan mails, carried by two sowars and going from Chakhansur to Farah, were recently looted about 24 miles north of Chakhansur. Twenty arrests have been made by the authorities in this connection. Cholera in Kainat.

His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain.1. Persian officials .—I have exchanged visits during the week with the new Mutwali Basin and MusTiawir-ul-Mumalik, the pishkar recently arrived from Tehran. The former appears to be a great improvement on his predecessor : the latter, who paid the first visit (paragraph 3 last week), has promised to help us in every w'ay. 2. Persian affairs (local ).—The cholera has not materially increased during the week, but there are as yet no signs of its disappearance. The number of cases reported has risen to 207 and deaths to 142, but while the number of deaths is probably approximately correct there can be little doubt that some cases are con cealed especially as opposition to the treatment employed has increased. Several of our employes or their relatives have been attacked, the diseases having recently / been more lively in this quarter of the town than elsewhere. There have also been three cases in the artillery barracks adjoining the Consulate grounds. The outbreak in the neighbouring villages have all practically ceased, but there are said to have been some cases in Chinaran district in spite of the quaran tine mentioned last week. 3. The Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has informed us of a piece of villainy on the part of Kamran Mirza which is no doubt responsible to some degree for the un settled condition of the province. Four months ago 9,000 tumans were drawn from the Revenue office for the payment of the provincial Karasuran. The Governor- General paid out 4,000, with promises of more which were never fulfilled, and kept the remainder. The time having arrived to draw another 9,000 he proposes to divide it in a similar manner, and the pishkar is pressing for the payment of all salaries to be entrusted to himself. Many of the robberies which are now almost of daily occurrence are attributed to the Karasuran. 4. Mirza Ali Asghar, late Revenue officer of Kuchan (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 34), has appealed to Tehran against his dismissal by M. Kornelis, and the latter has been asked to send the papers connected with the case to Tehran, retaining the man’s services pending further instructions. It is said, however, that a court of enquiry has found the charge of embezzlement fully proved. i 5. The Home Secretary informs Kamran Mirza that his inspecting offi cers are in the habit of making reports direct to him, and requests that they may be ordered to submit them through the head of the province. 6. Intrigues against Kamran Mirza have not entirely ceased (paragraph 1 last week), but the general attitude is one of hope in the new pishkar and his promises. 7. The Karguzar has heard from the Foreign Secretary that two Austrian * employes of the Customs Department are about to be posted to Meshed. Enquiry is being made. 8. Kamran Mirza has received a letter from Tehran announcing the arrest of several influential persons on account of implication in a plot to depose the Shah and place Shua-us-Sultanah on the throne. He is also informed that His Majesty’s Legation are paying out large sums to produce an agitation in favour of a republic in Persia, and that Mustauji-ul-Mumalik and Imam Juma have fallen into uni versal disfavour. * 9. Equiry has been made by Tehran regarding the difference of tumans 10 per kharwar in the price of grain bought from the Revenue office and subsequently sold to the bakers, and the Mushawir-ul-Mumalik is engaged in investigating the matter (paragraph 6 of Diary No. 33). &gt; • » . / \M | , ? ' ' ' t ♦ * • n ./ *10. The Mushawir-ul-Mumalik has ordered that:— (1) All sellers of firearms and ammunition in Meshed should submit to him complete lists of all arms, etc., in their possession at once, and that none whatever should be sold without the permission of the police. (2) The names of all arrivals in the city should be entered in lists to be kept for the purpose at the several gates. 11. Persian affairs (general). —The notorious robber Khuddu with fifty well armed followers is reported to 'be active on the Khakistar-Meshed road, and to be threatening the village of Khakistar itself, the inhabitants of which have no power to resist if attacked. 12. Further shocks of earthquake have been felt in Kuchan and Shirwan. 13. Khaf affairs are still most unsatisfactory. The new Governor on arrival sent a representative to treat with Mir Yusuf the rebel (paragraph 26 last week) and offered a free pardon on condition that he and his men could come in the fol lowing day and give us their arms. Mir Yousuf agreed but failed to put in an appearance as arranged and has since declared that he will not submit until the Government give him the village of Salami as a jagir. Meanwhile he continues to levy blackmail of grain on the people of the neighbourhood and is storing it in his stronghold of Tanurah. 14. Four wagons containing passengers and property have been plundered near Sabsawar. Much money and merchandise were carried off by the thieves who are said to be Kurds. 15. It is reported by the Russian telegraphist at Khaf that the Ilbaigi Kaudani assisted by some Afghan robbers has designs upon khaf ( see Jam news below). My colleague communicated this report to Kamran Mirza who merely replied that sowars had been sent to khaf; 16. British affairs. —The Karguzar and the new pishkar have both sent strong telegrams to Shuja-ud-Daulah urging him to pay at once the balance of tumans 3,000 due to the Imperial Bank on his first instalment ( paragraph 14 of Diary No 34). • WB m 17. During the Persian month of Asad ( 24th July to 24 August) British goods imported into Khorasan via Afghanistan only, consisting of thread, longcloth, sugar, spices, tea, and indigo, are valued at over four lakhs of rupees calculated at the rate of 40 brans to the 15 rupees. The statistics of import via Sistan and Nushki are not yet to hand. Ihe value of the goods imported from Russia during the same month and calculated at the same rate is under two lakhs of rupees. 18. Russian affairs. —Telegrams have been received by the Karguzar from 1 ehran urging him to despatch as soon as possible the Persian members of the Russo-Persian Commission for the settlement of the water disputes on the Daragez frontier (paragraph 18 last week). 19. A telegram has been received by merchants in 5\feshed from the mer cantile community of Resht, saying that the Russian Bank had obtained per mission from their Government to export 150 wagon loads of sugar (loaf) to Persia, and that they had declined to accept the consignment owing to the Bank not having agreed to their terms of purchase. They recommend the Meshedis to put the same terms to the Bank in the event of the sugar being offered to them. It is said that the Meshed traders intend to follow the advice of their Resht friends, the principal stipulation being that payment should be made by the pur chasers in roubles,. 20. Persian and German intrigues. —The following subjects have been dis cussed at the local meetings of the democrats during the week ;— (1) The sale of grain and bread in the city. Nothing fresh seems to have been suggested in this connection. (2) The desirability of ejecting M. Kornelis from the Revenue office and appointing an efficient Persian, or, failing that, some other foreigner in his place.(3) The necessity for securing the dismissal of the Governor-General before the end of the year. (4) The proposal to organise a small force of drilled and equipped gendar merie, for what precise purpose is not apparent. (5) The appointment of inspectors to visit the various branches and branch committees. Dissensions are still rife among these people, and very little is agreed upon. 21. Neivs from Turbat-i-H aidari—Qua,mntme against Meshed has been put in force, but almost simultaneously with this news comes a report that cholera has actually appeared in Turbat. The Governor-General has not replied to a ^reference from the Governor regarding expenditure in connection with cholera. 22. News from Karez. —Vide paragraph 29 last week. Shuja-ul-Mulk sent for various officials, the British agent at Karez, the Russian interpreter, etc., on the 2nd instant, and explained to them that one Hassan Khan, who had been imprisoned by the Naib-4-Hukumah of Herat for smuggling and other crimes, had _ escaped from prison and cf&gt;me to Persia : that the Naib had written to him ( Shuja ) asking him to arrest this man and send him to him : that he had referred the matter for the Governor-General’s orders and had received no reply : that Hassan Khan had joined the Ilbaigi Kaudani, and that both had sworn to kill him. He explained to the officials and agents that he had taken all possible precautions for his own safety but could not be responsible for theirs, and that they should make urgent references to their own superiors at Meshed. Mirza Akram Khan ( paragraph 28 last week ) having communicated with me I wrote officially to the Karguzar and sent messages to the Governor-General and Mushawir-ul-Mumalik. The former again said that he would at once recall Shaukat-ud-Daulah from Jam, and admitted that he had been wrong in not accepting our advice in regard to Jam affairs. The latter remarked that obviously the best course was to confirm Shaji-us-Saltanah as Governor of Jam and strengthen his hand by removing all opposition, and that he would do this at once. There is no news yet of any disturbance having occurred. 23. News from Herat. —The flock owners of Herat district have begged the Naib-ul-Hukumah to allow them to import grain from Sabsawar district, and the Naib has granted permission on condition that none is for export to a foreign country. 24. The payment of two-thirds of revenue due by the people of Ghurian has been excused for the present on account of scarcity. 25. Wagner visited the Naib Solar on the 25th August. The Naib told him that the Russians had burnt six Persian towns on the Russian frontier. Wagner replied that the Persians should have joined the Turks and taken the opportunity to recover their possessions from Russia while the latter was occupied with fighting Germany. He added that even now the Germans are ready to help Persia with money and arms. 26. Warner visited Kazim Beg on the 26th August and the Naib-ul-Hukumah joined them? The six burnt towns were referred to in conversation. The Naib remarked that he did not believe that the Russians could so behave in Persia at such a time as this, and was supported by Maulvi Barkatullah, who was also present. Wagner and Kazim Beg insisted that the news was true and it was decided to refer to Meshed for the facts. 27. Wagner is reported to have given instruction in survey work to the son of a subordinate of the Naib Solar on the 27th August. 28. A duffadar and three sowars have been punished by the Naib Solar ion neglect of duty at Bagh-i-Kartah. 29. Wagner intends to send another messenger to Panjdeh to bring news. 30. Wagner visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah at Chahar Bagh on the 30th August, where he also met the Naib Solar. The conversation seems to have been chiefiy upon the Subject of military ( fortifications and sketching.31. The servants of the German party have packed their carpets. It is not known what the object may be. 32. His Majesty’s Minister informs me that Abd-ur-Rahman, the Turkish Consul at Tehran, has not been absent from his post for two years. He cannot therefore be the person who has recently visited Herat with, it is supposed some communication from the Turkish Government. Meshed : W. G. GREY, L ieMtenant - Colonel , The 8th September 1917. ) His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. ,1 G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C401FD.—9-10-17—30—E.A.CONFIDENTfAL. 80 i 10 UG's 191/ j 23 NOV 1917 i Meshed Diary No. 37 for the week ending the 15ill September 1917. 1. Persian officials. —Haji Mujtaba, the late Naib-ul-Hukumah of Khaf who was concerned in the recent rebellion there, has reached Meshed. We have had him arrested and imprisoned in connection with the raid upon the property of our protege Haji Agha Muhammad (paragraph 26 of Diary No. 35). 2. Shahzadah Amir Akram, son of Kamran Mirza, who has been appointed Governor of Tun and Tabas, has arrived at Meshed from Tehran. 3. The fact that the Governor-General and his new pishJcar had already fallen out put fresh life into the intrigues against the former. On the afternoon of the Hth instant a meeting, presided over by Aghazadah (paragraph 1 of Diary No. 35), to reconsider the question of his remaining in office, was held and was attended by all the chief men of the city. In the evening Kamran Mirza sent for representatives of the Consulates-General and asked me and my colleague to— (1) restrain Aghazadah from raising a disturbance in the town, and (2) send threatening messages to Mushawir-ul-Mumalik forbidding him to intrigue against him. I telephoned to the Aghazadah asking him to keep quiet and reminding him of my promise to help him if certain circumstances arose, and my colleague warned him that in the event of a disturbance it would be necessary to turn out the Persian Cossack Brigade ; but I ignored Kamran’s second request, and M. Nicolsky merely replied to him that he would consider the situation. Next morning I called on my colleague and had this time no difficulty in inducing him to send a joint message to Kamran recommending him to resign, and a telegram to this effect was sent to Tehran by the Prince later in the day. We have not however heard of its acceptance by the Shah, and it is said that His Majesty wishes no change to be made before the end of the year. 4. Only two or three cases of cholera are now reported daily in the city, but as the number of cases and deaths for the week are each given as forty it is evident that some of the former are concealed. The disease is dying out, however, and it has entirely disappeared from this quarter of the town. 5 M. Kornelis has represented to the revenue office at Tehran that no action has yet been taken against the editors of the Meshed newspapers who recently published articles reviling him. 6. The War Office have issued a circular calling upon all commanders of troops to send in accurate lists of all units and personnel under their command, and threatening with severe punishment any commander whose returns are found to be incorrect. 7. There are now 230 members of the Union and Progress Society at Meshed, and the local democrats are attempting to effect an amalgamation with them. This attempt is not likely to succeed. 8. Persian affairs (general).—The Meshed-Chinaran road is infested with robbers, there being no less than four separate gangs, all of which have been active during°the week. The head of the Russian wool firm of Zurgagen and Co. was held up during the past few days, and both he and a young woman recently in the emnlovment of the Russian Consulate-General with whom he was travelling were relieved of their money. The Governor of Sar Wilayat, Rukn Khakan, has been cantured by a second band, and is detained in a village beyond Chinaran. The Governor-General has sent out a party to rescue him, but it is believed that his detention is the result of a determination on the part of the inhabitants of Sar Wilayat that he should not continue to rule over them, and that the robbers have been engaged to bring about a crisis. 9 No action has been taken against Khuddu from Khakistar (paragraph 11 last week). The local Governor remarks that as neither the Governor of Kuchannor tlie Chief of Bujnurd were able to deal with him how can he hope to succeed and refuses to move. Meanwhile Khuddu continues to raid travellers and pilgrims. 10. A report from Tursh : z states that Sardar Makhsus, the Governor, received pimans 2,000 from one Zabih-Ullah for a deputyship and ten days later dismissed him. The victim has appealed to Tehran. 11. Complaints of non-payment of Karasuran are continually comin» in (paragraph 3 last week). 12. The new Governor of Khaf appears to be weaker than his predecessor if that is possible. He is now reported to have sent a present of tumans 100 to Mir Yusuf (paragraph 13 last week) and to have appointed him head of 15 Karasuran. 13. A friend in Tehran has informed the Chief of Bujnurd that he should send him tumans 400, which sum will secure for him the charge of the country inhabited by the Goklan Turkomans (paragraph 12 of Diary No. 35). The Chief has replied that he will send the money if the matter is decided but not before. 14. British affairs .—The value of Indian imports into Khorassan via Nushki during the month of Asad (paragraph 17 last week) are estimated at over a lakh of rupees, which brings up the monthly total to more than five lakhs. Goods continue to arrive, and excellent progress is being made, but the Afghan route seems still to be preferred to that via Nushki and Sistan. 15. Russian affairs .—Besides the incident mentioned in paragraph 8 above two Russian subjects have been robbed of 30,000 roubles, etc., while en route to Russia via Kahkah ; on this occasion Khuddu was the successful criminal. An unpleasant feature of the lawlessness which prevails is that no distinction is now made between Persians and foreigners by the outlaws, who are increasing daily in audacity and impudence. 16. Russian subjects. 17. subjects returned and pre\ Complaints have reached the Tehran Foreign Office of the confiscation by troops at Tun and other places of certain arms, the property of Persian r i he Karguzar is asked to take the necessary action for their recovery. The Karguzar has sent in his report on the losses sustained by Persian at the hands of the Russians in connection with the war, but it has been to him for amplification and correction (paragraph 9 of Diary No. 30, ions reference). 18. I eisian and German intrigues. — Ihe Foreign Minister has telegraphed to the Karguzar directing him to restrain the democrats of Meshed from extreme action until the elections are over, and has received the reply that their views will be communicated to the Minister by post, A 19. The Meshed democrats have telegraphed to Tehran declining to receive he JN aiyur-ud-Daulah as Governor-General of Khorassan in succession to Kamran Muza, and suggesting two friends of their own as candidates. Failing either of these they recommend that the MusJiawir-ul-Mumalik may be given the post. 20. At the weekly meeting it was decided to work for the establishment o a municipality in Meshed. Several letters from Tehran democrats were read. 1i P t untamed nothing new except that the British Consulate-General should be watched as it was they who were primarily responsible for the arrest of innocent persons by the Russians : and the necessity for securing the' election of faithful democrats as members of the National Assembly was again uroed + t 2 V ^TiirbaG i -Haidari.—There have been some dozen eases of cholera m i ur )au. M. Mikhadooff, wffio ias not yet left, being one of them. M. Nicolsky te,.b me that Mikhailoft has K n dismissed from the service. Evidently some pemimary troubie prevents him from leaving Turbat (paragraph 21 of Diary23. The Mushawir-ul-Mumalih has written to Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakhurz, urging him in virtue of his faithfulness to Government to keep the Ilbaigi Kaudani in order ; and I have written to the I'lbaigi warning him of the result which would inevitably follow an attack upon any place which contained a Russian or British agent: urging him to deliver up to the Naib-ul-Hukumah of Herat the escaped prisoner (paragraph 22 last week) : and promising him friend ship and assistance in the event of his following my advice. Meanwhile a deputation has left Meshed to bring up Shaukat-ud-Daulah whose presence at Jam is the cause of all the trouble. 24. News from Karez. —Shuja-ul-Mulk has informed our agent that he has received orders from Meshed to proceed to Khaf and seize Mir Yusuf (paragraph 12 above), and that he has replied that it is not his business, adding that the long standing question of the payment of his sowars has never been settled and that he must at least be paid in advance when invited to undertake such a mission. 25. Shuja-ul-Mulk has ordered all caravans arriving from Meshed to be examined by the Russian assistant surgeon as a precaution against cholera. . 26. Shuja has received a friendly letter from the Ilbaigi (paragraph 23 above), giving out that he has no intention of attacking him. 27. News from Herat. The Turkoman Sardar ? Kurban Muhammad, has received permission to return to Turkestan and left on the 5th September, via Dahana-i-Zulfikar, in company with his relatives. 28. The property in search of which the Kami Ghulam Rasul Khan (paragraph 2 / of Diary No. 34) had come to Herat is proved to have been stolen by the Governors of Subsawar and Anardarah, who -divided it between them. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has dismissed both Governors, and has appointed a mamur to arrange for the return of the property to its owner. 29. Bayerl sold two horses for 80 tumans on the 2nd of September. The German party are again said to be short of funds. 30. Wagner gave another lesson in surveying on the 2nd to the same person (paragraph 27 last week). 31. Saiyid Riza was heard to tell one Ismail, a baker, that if he wished to see him they should meet in the bazar, as Wagner’s orders regarding outsiders coming to their quarters were now very strict. 32. Kazim Beg’s servant Asghar was heard to say on September 3rd that the Russian army was now divided into two parties, pro-German and pro- British, and that civil war between the two had actually commenced by reason of the desire of the pro-German party for peace. 33. When riding out on the 4th Kazim Beg told his orderly sowars that the 1 Amir had made a great mijbake in ordering the Waziris to cease fighting with the British and threatening to send the Mohmands against them in case they did not obey him. He said that the Amir should help the Usmanis who were his co religionists. The sowars gave no reply. 34. Wagner asked the Naib Solar on the 5th either to give him a plan of Herat town or to allow him to make one himself. The Naib replied that he would have one made by Wagner’s pupil, and would give that to him. 35. All the servants of the German party assembled to bid farewell to the Turkoman Sardar (paragraph 27 above), and some apprehension seems to have been expressed regarding the possibility of the British Agent obtaining news of his departure which might lead to his arrest by the Russians after crossing the frontier. 36. Wagner has asked the Mehmandar of Bagh-i-Kartah to dismiss the garde ners for fear that there may be a spy among them, and has asked the Naib Solar to watch carefully the movements of the British Agent and his servants. The Naib has not hitherto replied to this request. \ /37. Some time ago Wagner asked the Naib-ul-Hulcumah to supply him with funds when he required them. The Naib referred to Kabul for orders, and has received permission to give money on receipts as required. 38. The arrival of two Turks at Bala Murghab, one of whom is a doctor, is reported.

Russian force. —The supply of forage here has been presenting some difficulties, and Colonel Gustchin 9 having obtained no assistance from the Russian Consulate-General, asked if we could introduce a reliable contractor to him. Through the good offices of our Consulate-General an individual was sent who seems to be in a fair way to supply Russian requirements in lucerne and chopped straw. The question of barley presents more difficulty, as owing to the failure of the harvest and the dishonesty of officials, barley has become a staple article of food for the people, but it is hoped that the matter will be satisfactorily arranged. 397. Suspects. —The Russian Consulate-General in the course of the week arrested an Austrian Pole in hiding in the house of a Russian subject in the city, whom they have reason to believe to be a secret German agent. They consider it probable that the man is orginally an escaped prisoner of war, but he was provided with false papers obtained in Russia. He appears to have had three companions who left towards Tehran some days before the arrest was made, and steps have been taken to intercept them if possible. The man who harboured them—a Caucasian or Azarbaijan Turk—disappeared before he could be arrested. It seems possible that these men may be identical with these noted in paragraph 384 as having left Khakistar on the 15th August, but there is at present some doubt as to how long ago the Pole’s party reached the city. Reference paragraph 369, the Mujnabad agent sends me a description of Raza Bala alias Gul Muhammad Khan, whom he says he saw with the German party at Mainana last year. The man is said to be a Turk by origin and to speak Persian, Turkish, Pushtu, Arabic, and a little Russian. Description. —Age about 45 . Wheat complexion. Tall. Black hair, long mustache, no beard. Long nose, thick eyebrows. Right ear pierced. Black mole on left of neck. 398. Deserters. —The five Indian labour corps deserters were despatched to Sehdeh under Russian escort on the 28th August. 399. Jamshedis.—hn agent at Barashk reports hearing from arrivals from Sarakhs that Sayyid Ahmad Beg is^very troublesome on the Russo-Afghan frontier. He had some 40 savars of his tribe, and was raiding harvest grain, taking inter alia 8 camel-loads of wheat belonging to the Persian Government. 400. Local. —Conditions in the province remain much the same. Cholera continues in practically all quarters of the city, and somewhat upwards of 140 cases have occurred (*.£., have been reported) up to date. The outbreak at Turuk is yielding to measures of sanitation, but the disease has appeared at the village of Muhammadabad almost adjoining the city. Herat and Afghanistan, 401. Germans and adherents.— German’s servants have readily adopt-* ed the overbearing detlieanour of their masters, and one of them is making himself very unpopular as a patient at the Herat hospital. Kazim Beg and Barakatullah are at variance as to the degree of assistance and sympathy to be expected from the Naib-ul-Hukumah, and the Naib Salar. The former thinks that the Naib Salar is entirely on their side ; Barakatullah is more sceptical as to the sincerity of his friendship. An agent has just returned from Mazar-i-Sharif, which he left on the 20th August vid Russia^territory, with the news that Mohendro Partap, attended by his &amp; two Sikh followers and 12 Afghan savars placed at his disposal by theAfghan Government, returned to Mazar on the i8ih July. Aluhammed Umar Khan brother-in-law of the Naib-ul-Hukumah, with a body of cavalry; went to receive him some miles outside the city, and he was ceremoniously conducted to the garden of Ismail Khan at Mazar which has been purchased for a lar&lt;re sum either by Mohendro himself or by the Afghan Government. The Sikhs—one’of whom is named Jigar (Query, Jagat ?J Singh-and the cavalry escort are very discreet as to the late movements of the pari\ and although two of the latter belong to the same tribe as the agent, they stated that they had strict orders to keep silence. They said, however that thev had reached the Chinese frontier some days after the arrival there was talk of a fresh departure and two Barbaris, one of whom was personally known to the agent, were pre sented to the “ Rajah ” as useful guides. He eventually told them that they were not required for the present but should hold themselves in readiness for his orders. Herat was rumoured as at any rate the first stage of the journey, and it was said that all frontiers except the Persian were impossible. Incidentally the two Barbaris, who are employed at the Government stables, stated that they had just returned from guiding two Germans to Isfahan, and that they had exhibited to Mohendro the certificates they had received from the travellers The two Barbaris are named Ali Ahmad and Mahmud. Ah Ahmad onlv is known to the agent who describes him as follows: Age about 40 ; medium height ; thin ; lightish complexion marked with stna»l pox; thm black 1 Mart Hair • one uDoer front tooth broken. Two Turks escaped prisoners of war from Russia, a^e resmeni. at Mazar* i-Sharif. One is a colonel for whose subsistence 10 krans per diem is allowed, and the other a private, who receives 4 krans per diem. There was talk of their oroceeding to Herat with the object of regaini.g their country, but they appear to have accepted the situation and to be prepared to await the end of the war at Mazar. Two -\.ust r ian escaped prisoners are also there. They are guarded with considerable strictness in the Kotwali, as the Germans mentioned above are saMto have expressed suspicion as to their being in reality Russian spies. 40* Discipline. —A Court of Enquiry is collecting evidence as to bribes and defalcations of which Colonel Muhammad Kazim Khan of the 9th Herati Battalion was accused. Some tension exists among the ofHcers of the gamson whose consciences perhaps are not quite clear. The dissatisfaction in the Ghaznichi battalion is not yet at an end, as the brother of the accused Subadar has taken his discharge, and in consequence the men do not believe in the reinstatement of their officer. 40-. 5/^s.—Reference paragraph 391, 7,000 pairs of boots, 7,000 haver sacks' a* few swords for the officers, and some cloth were brought by Rissaldar Muhammed Akram Khan from Kabul on some 70 to 80 ponies. Many articles which had been indented for were not brought, and the Naib Salar is indignant with the officer in consequence. A long list of requirements, including artillery stores, is being made out to be brought from Kabul by Rissaldar Gulzar Khan. ■ 04. Kha’sanin. —In Durbar the Naib Salar expressed his dissatisfaction with the want of discipline of kkavanin sarars, and their neglect of frontier duties He is considering the advisability of replacing them by regular cavalry. \n officer has been ordered to check the strength of khavanin at various posts. 40^. Mazar-i -Sharif. —The agent mentioned above supplies the following particulars: Garrison. In spite of the inclusion of ihassadars, infantry bat talions are below the establishment of 600. On this account orders to dismiss the old and unfit men are not complied with till the candidate for discharge sup plies a substitute, and incidentally a bribe. About 400 men of the Kandahari battalion are armed with n-shot magazine rifles. No others have been issued. The infantry are drilled with regularity. Cavalry drill is less practised, and during 3 months no guns were seen out, either for drill or firing practice.No recruits had been conscripted in the city on the I per 8 basis up to the 20th August. Discontent on that account in the districts was partly motive by the levy of horses at absurdly low prices, and by the oppressive exactions of the Naib-ul*Hukumah. It was rumoured that the 5° Barbari sappers would be increased to 55 °’ up to date no enlistment on this account has been made. During June, io*old pattern M. L. guns were received from Tashkurgan on receipt there of modern guns. This probably accounts for the report of receipt of guns at Mazar, noted in paragraph 388, confirmation of the despatch of which from Kabul is wanting. Horses. —Horses were collected in the district and despatched to Kabul as under:— June ... ... ... .*• ••• 7 00 July ... ••• ... ••• 4 00 August ... ... ... ••• ••• 4 °° Agent' is unable to state how many had previously been despatched, but the order for the levy was still in force at the latter end of August, and horses were being brought into the city. Stores. —All military stores, powder, etc., are said to be kept at Darrah-i- Shadian, some 2 miles south of Dehdadeh. One year’s reserve rations for the ganison is reported to be stored there. Russian Turkistan. 406. Current events.—Very little news is to hand this week. Considerable distress is reported among the lurkoman in Tejen district, where deaths from hunger are said to have occurred. Ashkabad authorities have despatched some grain as a temporary measure. Both Turkoman and Baluch are said to be troublesome on the Russo-Persian border, where raids, chiefly connected with grain, have occurred. Smuggling of wheat into Russia from Sarakhs neighbourhood is reported. Turkoman continue to purchase such rifles as they can get in Persia. Arrivals report trouble with Kirghiz. This presumably refers to Semirechia, and is no doubt an echo of the disorders noted in recent summaries. Meshed ; 1 st September /p/7. 1 E. A. F. REDL, LieutsColonel..

Khorasan and North-East Persia. 407. Russian force.—A sma\\ Cossack escort, conducting the 5 Indian deserters to Sehdeh, were attacked by some 15 robbers near Amrani. After some interchange of shots the robbers retired. Tnis is the first instance of an attack on Cossacks who have, in spite of disturbed conditions, hitherto passed unmolested in however small numbers from post to post. Further details are awaited. 408. Jamshedis .—According to latest reports Sayyid Ahmad Beg has quitted Persian territory and retired to Chaman-i-Bid in the Panjdeh district. His followers are said to have looted some camel-loads of grain from near Persian Sarakhs, and to have been unsuccessfully pursued by Ghulam Riza Khan, son of the Sarakhs governor. Official confirmation of his escape from Russian surveillance is still lacking, but the multiplicity of reports concerning him would hardly appear to leave the matter in doubt. The main issue seems to be that although he has reputedly been a free agent for at least months, he has not succeeded in materially increasing his following, or in causing anxiety to the Afghan officials. (Nothing has been heard from Herat concerning him). One robber more or less is not of paramount importance in these days, and as far as can be foreseen, there is little likelihood of his being in a position to create a political incident. 409. Local affairs .—Disorder in the province is on the increase. In the north Khaddu is active on the Kahka road near Khakistar. Apart from black mailing travellers his men are reported to have occupied a strong position and to’ be setting the karasuran savars at defiance. In the Jam district Shuja-ul- Mulk has become involved in the general imbroglio, is taking measures for his personal protection, and has disclaimed ability to protect British and Russian representatives in the vicinity. The mischief created by the intrigues of Shaukat- ad-Daula, and by the weakness of the administration is very great. From other parts the Governor-General has been freely petitioned to take effective measures against the numerous robbers, and some villagers have gone so far as to ask for sarbaz to be quartered in their villages—a suffi cient indication of their state of mind. Mushavar-al-Mamalik, the newly-arrived assistant to the Governor-General, is displaying energy in grappling with existent evils. Crediting him with every good intention, however, it is doubtful if, under the present regime^ he has much chance of cleansing the Augean stable. Somewhat upwards of 200 cases of cholera have been reported up-to-date in the city, and the daily toll of victims does not diminish. The disease has appeared at Turbat-i-Haidari and at Khidri, on the Russian line of posts to the south. So far the Russian troops have not been attacked. Some excitement has been caused in Transcaspia by the report of the disease at Meshed. The authorities decided to telegraph to Petrograd for medical personnel for quarantine measures, and in the meantime to establish medical observation posts on the principal routes. Up till quite recently, how ever, the latter decision had not been acted upon, and no news is to hand of the institution of such posts. Herat and Afghanistan. 410, Germans and adherents .—The German party are now attempting to make capital out of exaggerated report of the looting of towns and bazars by Russian troops in N. W. Persia. The Naib-ul-Hukumah, however, displayed good sense in refusing to believe in the reports as presented to him, Wagner is still proffering advice on military matters. -vi) 1The carpets of the German party have been made up in bales, with what object it is not yet clear, 411. Military affairs .—The Naib Salar in Durbar announced his^ intention of enlisting 4 carpenters and 4 cobblers per infantry battalion, and of distributing the Sappers and Miners among the infantry at the rate of 16 men per battalion. For purposes of drill and instruction, however, the Sappers would still form a separate unit under their own officers. In pursuance of his intention to raise a third cavalry regiment, he has called for volunteers willing to transfer from the infantry. Each candidate will be called upon to produce an assami of 100 rupees, and a suitable horse. This and kindred measures previously noted appear to indicate a dearth of recruits. Infantry battalions are reported as under strength, but an accurate report on the subject is awaited. The garrison of Ghurian is to be changed to permit of an investigation of a charge of intrigues against him, brought by the commander of the post against his subordinates. Russian Turkistan. 412. Current affairs .—Work on the new census has begun throughout Turkistan. Supplies of every sort are evidently very short, and it is stated that it may be necessary to reduce still further the daily allowance of f lb, bread and of ij lbs. allowed to persons engaged in exacting physical labour, if the 2 million puds (33,333 tons) of grain expected from the Caucasus are not received in time. Native arrivals from Turkistan state that the most meagre supply of bread can only be obtained after hours of waiting, and that rice, cigarettes, and sugar are practically unobtainable. Attempts to dispose of Russian sugar for silver currency to Persia are stated to have been unsuccessful. Dearth of firewood for the ensuing winter is foreshadowed. Tashkent would appear more likely to be affected than Askhabad. 412. Military .— From native sources a report is current that the Russians have called for 3,000 Turkomans from Transcaspia for the front. There is no confirmation of this in Russian papers, but it is quite possible that reinforce ments have been called for for the Turkoman cavalry regiment, although the number required is very probably exaggerated. Native rumours also announce substantial reinforcements to Kushk and Termez. Recruits to replace drafts to the front despatched from those places seems the most likely explanation. The Russians are also said to have despatched a number of strips of felt— the object of which is supposed to be the assistance of artillery over sandy ground—to Termez. 413. Khiva .—A somewhat didactic telegram was despatched on the 20th August by the committee of the “ 4th regiment (4th Orenburg Cossacks?) at Khiva to the “ Cossack circle” at Tashkent. It states that the robberies still continue unchecked, Khivan natives being the principal victims ; that the troops are more burdensome to peaceful inhabitants than to the Yomud robbers ; that concerted work between military and civil officials leaves much to be desired; and that little actual improvement can be expected without radical improvement of administrative institutions in the Khanate. The communication does not appear to outline a very serious situation, even though local affairs are evidently in an unsatisfactory condition. 414. Railways .—The departure of some 15 engineers and assistants from Moscow to undertake investigations on the proposed Alexandrov Gai-Charjui railway is announced.There has been no mention cf work in laying the rail’s on the Arys-Vyerni line for some time, but the Askhabad-Bezmen branch is apparently still working. It may be supposed, therefore, that owing to the disappointment regarding grain to be expected from Sernirechia the dismantling of this branch in favour of the Vyemi line has been abandoned.

Persian officials .—Early in the week a special meeting was held in the house of the Kais-ut-Tujjar to discuss the conduct of Kamran Mirza as Governor- General, and subsequently a telegram was despatched to Tehran, signed by many persons of influence, once more urging his recall. The Aghazada, chief local religious authority and head of the Shrine, leads this party. Kamran Mirza sent to us and to the Russian Consulate-General for help in this further difficulty, but in view of the bread fiasco elsewhere dealt with and the appalling condition of the province I did not feel able to give him satisfactory assurances. I hear this morning (25th) from a secret source that my colleague has sent to the Aghazada actually threatening him with Russian troops in the event of the continuance of this agitation. I hope to see M. Nicolsky later in the day. 2. Khabir Khakan, the local telegraph superintendent, informs us that there is a probability of his being dismissed as some one in Tehran has offered tumans 1,000 for his post and he has not the means to outbid this. He adds that a refer ence to Tehran by ourselves would not help, as Mr. New’s power has been limited by the present government. 3. Mirza Ali Asghar, the Revenue officer at Kuchan, has been sumfmoned to Meshed and replaced by Mirza Ismail Khan, lately first assistant in the Meshed office, 4. Persian affairs (local). —It was announced on the 18th instant that cholera had appeared in the city, and a committee of doctors was at once appointed to deal with it. Dr. Hoffman of the American Presbyterian Mission has been placed in charge of cases and treatment, and K. S. Zahir-ud-Din supervises sanitation and preventive measures. The outbreak has some puzzling featured: the main water supply does not seem to have become infected, and the cases which have so far occurred are scattered throughout the town. It is difficult to ascertain their exact number, but the official returns issued by this office after discussion with the two officers above mentioned are, from 19th to 23rd inclusive, 82 cases, 36 deaths. There have been many severe attacks; but as a rule the disease seems to take a mild form, and it is probable that the number of deaths given include some which were not from cholera. On the other hand it is likely that some cases have been concealed, as there is a party who wish to deny the existence of anything more serious than cholerine. The disease having appeared at Nishapur (one case), and Sabsawar (three cases), quarantine on the Tehran road seems to be of little use; but a station is being established at Chinaran to guard the roads leading to the north. Late news announces a severe outbreak at Turuk, a village of about 1,000 inhabitants which lies to the S.S.E. of Meshed about five miles from the city. Here forty cases are said to have occurred. 5. A specimen of the bread now sold in the bazar was brought to me on the 23rd instant. It is a compound of earth, barley, and straw: it must be extremely indigestible, and its nutritive properties very small indeed. That it is responsible for much indisposition is certain. The Governor-General and Ma’tamid-ul-Wizafah pretend that the surplus proceeds of the sale of revenue grain (paragraph 6 last week) were destined to pay the expenses of importing from outstations; but this is not accepted as a satisfactory explanation, and public opinion is consequently deserting the Ma’tamid. M. Kornelis has also recommended his transfer from Meshed, but has himself again received orders not to interfere in the bread question which is apparently to be regarded as a fair field for the avarice of the Governor-General and his satellites. M. Kornelis has replied detailing the existing abuses and urging the necessity for compelling private owners to sell their grain.\ '■ | &lt; t Si I m , j ii ; 6. In view of the drought this year the Revenue department have wisely decided not to recover revenue on garden produce pending the receipt of orders on the subject from Tehran. 7. The Revenue department, have paid to the Governor-General tumans 500 under orders from Tehran for expenditure incurred in connection with the out break of cholera (paragraph 4 above). 8. The murderer of the late Governor of Radkan (paragraph 10 of Diary No. 32) was arrested in Meshed bazar on the 24th instant. He had come to the town and enlisted in the Persian Cossack Brigade, apparently supposing that no one suspected him. He is to be tried by Colonel Mamanoff. 9. The Union and Progress society are growing in numbers. They have established eight branch committees of 10 or 12 members each, and hold three meetings weekly. They seem to have no revolutionary or European ideas. 10. Persian affairs (general).r—The Home Secretary has asked Kamran Mirza for an explanation of (1)’ the murder of the Governor of Radkan, and (2) the recent occurrences at and near Lutfabad (paragraph 13 last week). 11. Heavy rain fell in Kuchan and Shirvan on the 18th, the first for several months. 12. No grain has as yet come from Kuchan (paragraph 15 last week). Tke- Governor-General has telegraphed to Tehran asking that orders may be issued for- the supply of wheat to Meshed from Nishapur and Sar Walayat, as well as Kuchan,. according to the yearly custom. 13. British affairs. —The five missing Barbaris (paragraph 19 last week) have arrived safely at Gunabad, and the party which had reached Turbat-i-Haidari are also proceeding thither. 14. Shuja-ud-Daulah has paid another 500 tumans to the Imperial Bank. This leaves 3,000 to be paid this month according to his contract (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 7). 15. Russian affairs. —I have discussed the question of the Armenian revo lutionaries (paragraph 21 last week) with my colleague. He is of opinion that nothing will be achieved by them here, and this view appears to be shared by the 0-. C. troops. 16. The Karguzar has received a telegram from Sarakhs informing him that the Turkomans residing in Russian Sarakhs are busily purchasing firearms; and another from the Karguzar of Daragez which says that the latter has visited Askabad in connection with the water disputes on the Daragez and Khelat fron tiers (paragraph 15 of Diary No. 32). It seems that a joint commission will shortly meet to settle these difficulties. 17. My colleague has informed the Karguzar in reply to a reference regarding the Armenian visitors (paragraph 15 above) that, though there is nothing to be- feared from them, there are a certain number of dangerous Russian Muslim subjects now in the city upon whom a careful watch is being kept by him. ]8. Persian and German intrigues .—The Russian Consul-General has declined to endorse the passport of a young democrat, the brother of the editor of the Persian journal “Nau Bahar,” for the present, alleging that there are reasons for his departure from Meshed to be delayed for a time.. 19. Meetings of the democrat society take place as usual, but are not well attended at present owing to the differences mentioned last week.' The collection of firearms continues however, and a sum of money has recently been sent to one, Mirza Muhammad Hussain Turk Rabat in this connection, at Tehran. 20. The editor of the “Nau Bahar’’ has been requested by Meshed democrats to work for the dismissal of Kamran Mirza and the appointment of a strong democrat in his place, and the Central Committee at Tehran have been asked for instructions as to the attitude to be observed by their brethren here towards the newly formed Union and Progress society.os i 2 f ' News from Turbat-i-Haidari.— Forty Khaf rebels from Tanurah (paragraph 2 ast week) have attacked and plundered the village of Abbasabad. No details are as yet to hand. , 22 - Th !‘ wo na “ e d Ghulam Riza (paragraph 27 last week) have been stili a at C Herat ier ° f them beUlg ^ German messen ger. The latter appears to be 23. The amount of grain to be exported to Meshed has been increased to 700 kharvars (paragraph 26 last week). 24. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—-By again pointing out the desirability ot maintaining a pro-ally Governor at Jam, and urging once more the valuable services already rendered to us by Shaji-us-Saltanah I succeeded in persuading my colleague to make a joint representation on the subject to Kamran Mirza : and the latter at first gave me a definite promise that he would appoint Shaii to Jam forthwith and his brother Shaukat to Kuh Payat; but three days later he informed M. 2\icolsky that the present unsatisfactory arrangement must continue.. r c . W( J rst Mature of that .is that the Afghan frontier portion of the Jam district lies m Shaukat s control. 25. News from AW-Our Agent reports that Haji Mujtaba (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 32) although wounded is fit to travel and will soon come to Meshed It is to be hoped that he will then meet'his deserts. r , , 26 * News from Herat. Five men have been sentenced to imprisonment for lire lor constructing false shrines to gain a livelihood. 27. The arrival of one Ghulam Rasul Khan is reported from Anardarah He claims to be m tlmservice of the Amir of Kain, and to have brought a letter” from Jnm lor the A iab-ul-Hukumah concerning some stolen property which is said to have been traced to Sabsawar. 28. The Governor of Kuhsan has sent in to Herat a suspicious stranger who- states that he is a native of the Herat village of Taryak, but is believed on account ol his fair complexion to be a European. Enquiries are being made at Taryak. 29. The Af ghan-Pan j deh frontier has apparently been closed recentlv in common with other frontiers. - J 30. It is reported that the Naib Salar allowed a Government farrier to shoe the horses and mules of the German party free of charge. They have hitherto had to pay for such services. 31. Wagner’s servant Nasrullah is said to have stated openly on the 12th instant that the Naib Salar was their friend and that the Naib-ul-Hukumah (who- by inference is not) had no power to restrain him from helping them.. 32. The German party and their servants seem to t/ike more care than hitherto* to prevent their conversation being overheard by any one who might chance to be a spy of the British Agent. This is natural after the failure of their recent missions to Persia via Karez and Meshed. It seems that on the 15th Nasrullah was- told by Haji Ghulam Hussain what he nmst have known before, that their messengers had been caught by means of information given by our Herat Agent. This- Haji is extraordinarily changeable and unreliable,, even for an Afghan.. 33. The servants of Kazim Beg have again spread lying reports regarding allied reverses, the arrival of a Turkish force at Tehran, etc., but their stories have not deceived the people. 34. I have not yet received information hoped for in connection with the newspaper mentioned in paragraph 35 last week, and this will follow later : with further remarks on Abd-ur-Rahman (paragraph 37 last week)..

Persian officials. —I interviewed my colleague on the 26th August at some length on the subject of Kamran Mirza (paragraph 1 last week). He did not men tion having threatened to quell any agitation against Kamran by force, but admitted having sent to Agharzada ordering him to desist from his proceedings, and gave as his reason for so doing the fear that were this Governor-General dismissed we might have in his place one who would work definitely against the Allies. I notice from office records that this argument was employed with my predecessor when the latter urged M. Nicolsky to join him in a request for the dismissal of Naiyur- ud-Daulah last year. It was agreed ultimately that as the newly appointed pishkar, Mushawir- ul-Mumalik, was about to arrive from Tehran we would give Kamran Mirza a last chance to work acceptably through him, and we sent a reassuring message to Agharzada promising to move in the matter of Kamran’s relief as soon as we were persuaded that this final arrangement was not satisfactory. * / 2. The Governor of Turkobai has been dismissed, and Shuja-ul-Ayalah appointed in his place. 3. Mushawir-ul-Mumalik, the pislikar above alluded to, arrived on the 29th ultimo. He drove into the town in the Governor-General’s closed carriage, and was hooted by the crowd, who supposed that it was the Prince himself. My colleague informed me on Thursday last that he had already sent to him saying that as he had come with larger powers than those usually possessed by a pishkar he supposed that the Consuls-General would pay him the first visits. He has not yet favoured me with any such impertinence. 4. M. Kornelis has offered to resign from the Revenue office, but it is not yet known whether or no his resignation has been accepted. • %/ ' ■ 5. Persian affairs {local). —The cholera (paragraph 4 last week) has not taken an epidemic form, and the sanitary and other arrangements are working satifac- torily considering the difficulties that have to be faced. The number of cases reported to have occurred in the city up to and including 31st August are 145, and the number of deaths 85 : to-day’s return shewing cases 14 and deaths 6 only. The outbreak at Turuk mentioned last week has subsided, but a few cases have occurred at Muhammabad, a village just outside the town to the south. The officials appointed for quarantine work at Chinaran have arrived there and commenced operations. Daily bulletins are issued from this office to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, Kirman, and Birjand. 6. The local Telegraph Superintendent has been informed that an increase in the cost of telegrams of one shahi per word is ordered, and that the additional funds acquired will be devoted to increase in the pay of telegraph officials. 7. The Mushawir-ul-Mumalik (paragraph 3 above) has, after all, brought with him Hussain Kuli Khan, the man to whose nomination as Chief of Police my colleague had objected on the ground of his Turkish sympathies (paragraph 2 of Diary No. 31). His appointment has not yet been announced. 8. M. Kornelis’ zeal has again exceeded his discretion. He had sent out various revenue inspectors without first ascertaining from Tehran that the neces sary expenditure would be allowed, and he is now informed that it will not; there being no provision in the budget. - . 9. It is directed by Tehran that all telegrams relating to cholera be sent free of charge. ^ 10. The Governor-General has been ordered to recover tumans 2,016 on account of a robbery that occurred on the Turshiz road on August 28th, this amount being claimed by the Minister of Posts whose men were plundered.11. Persian affairs (general). ~ News having reached Tun and Tabas of the appointment of Kamran Kirza’s son as Governor (paragraph 4 of Diary No. 31), Salar Arfa the present incumbent, who has only just paid peshkush for the post, has telegraphed to Tehran protesting against the job. 12. The Chief of Bujnurd has again urged upon the Government the necessity of strong control being exercised over the Goklan Turkomans, and proposes him self for the work as their country adjoins his district. 13. The arrival is reported at Sarakhs of 12 military sowars from Meshed to assist in guarding the frontier. 14. Robbery of the post is reported fr|m Chinaran, where disorder still prevails. ' 15. Three severe shocks of earthquake were felt at Shirwan on the afternoon of the 29th August, and a portion of the local telegraph office collapsed. (The shocks were faintly perceptible in Meshed.) 16. British affairs.—Indian goods valued at about Rs. 70,000 for the British Indian firm of Hakkak Brothers arrived at Meshed during the week. More are shortly expected. 17. Russian affairs. —The Karguzar has protested formally to my colleague regarding the arrest of the two Ghulam Rizas (paragraph 22 last week) sug gesting care in such matters for fear of trouble with the Afghans. (Our allies carry out arrests with very little discrimination.) 18. The commission to settle the water disputes on the Daragez frontier has ' not yet left MesMd. Meanwhile the Karguzar at Daragez reports that the Tur komans have no case and merely wish to make the question an excuse for lawless conduct. It is now said that the latter are being supplied with arms and ammuni tion by the Russian Government. 19. M. Kornelis has telegraphed to the Minister of Revenue that the Russian Agent in Kuchan (who is also the Russian bank manager there) has confiscated the produce of the Rais-ut-Tujjar’s lands (paragraph 9 of Diary No. 28) in part payment of the Rais’ debt to the bank, and that in consequence no revenue has been levied on this land. 20. The local newspaper “ Chaman ° published an article strongly con demning Kamran Mirza a few days ago. He sent to my colleague asking what he should do. M. Nicolsky replied that he should arrest and punish him, well knowing that he would not take his advice. 21. The local Russian subjects are quarrelling among themselves over the question of representation in the committee ; and the two parties, known as Karabaghis and Bakuis, have referred their case to M. Nicolsky, who finds himself unable to pacify them. Trouble is feared. 22. It is reported that some Russian subject in the city has recently con cealed four persons, two of whom are said to be Turks, one an Austrian, and one a German. Three are believed to have been sent off secretly to Tehran, but the other has been arrested by the Russian Consulate. Full information is not yet available, but the men appear to be escaped prisoners. 23. Persian and German intrigues. —The local democrats are still occupied almost entirely with their own differences. They have received letters during the week from Tehran urging reconciliation, one of which gives clearly to understand that there are similar troubles there. The writer says that British and Russian gold has been the cause of much harm to the society in Tehran. 24. On the 23rd August a telegram was received from His Majesty’s Consul in Kirman informing us that the Turk Obeidullah with Hassan Khan Buchaqchi and about 12 followers after a brush with Government troops were moving in the direction of Khorassan. The Consul kindly furnished descriptions of the two men named, and. the Russians have been informed.25. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Some anxiety preva^s in the town on account of fear of misconchn t on the part of Russian CossacKs, and 40—50 armed Persian infantrymen are patrolling the streets day and night. M. Anl/poff, the c Russian Vice-Consul, has givo^ the Governor an official assurance in writing that nothing of the kind will taker place, but neither the officials nor the townspeople are entirely satisfied. 26. The new Governor of Khaf, Shahzadah Abdullah Mirza, has passed through Turbat en route to take up his post. The property plundered at Khaf by Mir Tusuf recently (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 32, etc.) has been removed to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. A considerable portion of it belongs to a British protege Haji Agha Muhammad, Agent of the Imperial Bank at Turbat-i-Haidari. 27. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Mehdi Kuli, late British news agent at Jam and accomplice of Mirza Hassan Khan in his crimes, has been taken into favour by Shaukat-ud-Daulah and given the title of “ Sultan with some employment. 28. News from Affirm.—Mirza Akram Khan, brother of K. S. Aslam Khan, our.Agent at Herat, has been appointed Agent at Karez and has taken over charge. Khan Sahib Allah Din is returning to Meshed. 29. Shuja-ul-Mulk has received a request from the Naib-ul-Hukumah df Herat to deliver to him one M. Hassan Khan a fugitive from jus^ce. Shuja has replied that this man is not with iym but with the Ilbaigi KaudAni who is now in the charge of Shaukat-ud-Daulan. The Naib talks of sending an armed force to seize the criminal. (Other similar troubles may be expected. The criminal negligence of M. Nicolsky in not being firmer with Kamran Mirza regarding the intrigues of Shaukat may be responsible for much disturbance on the frontier.) C 30. News from Herat. —One Abdul Aziz Khan, cousin of Umra Khan of Jandol (paragraph 4 of Kabul Diary, dated June 7th last), has been brought into Herat as a prisoner. 31. The Naib-ul-Hukumah is said to have told an inhabitant of the village of Karkh who protested to him against the forcible enlistment of men for various Government duties that many more would have to give their services before long. 32. A careful inspection of all frontier posts occupied by Khawanin sowars has been ordered by the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 33. The purchase of 1,200 camels for the transport of Government grain to Herat from outstations has been ordered by the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 34. M. Nicolsky has given me a small photograph of Mahendra Pertab which | ► I have had enlarged. Copies have been despatched to Kashgar, Kashmir, Chitral, | and Gilgit, but the latest news seems to point to Mahendra having returned to Mazar-i-Sharif. 35. Wagner continues to help the Naib Salar in military matters. He has just had targets and flags made apparently for musketry practice, and has presented them to him v 36. Agha Karim, one of Wagner’s servants has been admitted to hospital suffering from some infectious disease. He has already given trouble to the Indian doctor. 37. On the 19th August the Naib Salar brought a map and left it with Kazim Beg. When he had gone Kazim remarked to Maulvi Barkatullah how much better the conduct of the Naib Salar was towards them than that of the Naib-ul-Hukumah ; as the forpier always believed what they told him which the latter did not. The Maulvi did not agree, and upon Kazim asking his reason said that he would tell him at some other time. 38. A Kaini has petitioned to the Naib-ul-Hukumah regarding his treatment by Ghulam Riza who had engaged him as guide when coming from Meshed recently.He says that Ghulam Riza borrowed from him 100 krans while on the journey, and promised on arrival at Herat to return this sum to him with 200 more as a reward : but that when they reached Herat he was sent to prison by the Mehmandar of Bagh-i-Kartah and got nothing. The Mib is making enquiries. 09 B a ^erl was asked on 21 st August how it was that whereas a short time ago the German party were anxious to get away as soon as possible they had now ceased to talk about leaving Herat. He replied that the Russians had desired to make peace but had been prevented by the British, and that they would now remain in Herat until the end of the v ar. * - - e 40. Warner is reported to be exercising caution in regard to information leaking out.° He has directed that no strangers be allowed to enter his stables, etc. 41. No reply has come from Herat regarding the newspaper (paragraph 34, last week ). 42. I hear that Abd-ur-Rahman, the Turkish Consul, is still in Tehran, but have not yet confirmed the suspicion that he may recently haA e been on a secret and confidential mission to Afghanistan. W. G.

Khorasan and North East Persia. . 373 - Jamshedis.- No reply concerning Sayyid Ahmad Beg having been received from the General Staff, Tashkent, for a fortnight, the Military Agent repeated his enquiry but so far without result. &amp; An agent whom I had despatched to investigate the matter*returned in the course of the week from Langar, in which place, and in surrounding villages, he had obtamed from several sources information that Sayyid Ahmad Beg after raiding in the Badghis district had repaired to Sher Tapa on the Perso-Russian order to the north of Pul-i-Khatun. He had been received in friendly fashion y t e villagers who had killed 12 sheep in his honour, and he was engaged in exchanging his tired horses for fresh ones and in recruiting his personneCwhich a V She Ji a P a consisted of some 30 followers. Most of informants were persons who had been proceeding to Sher Tapa, but had been dissuaded from going as far kj ^ he n ™ s ? f the Jamshedis’ presence there. The agent met an inhabitant 01 Mahmudabad near Langar, who had personally exchanged his own horse for one of Sayyid Ahmad Beg’s and an additional sum of money. Owing to a change of agents, and probably to disturbed conditions and dim cult communication, direct reports which should have reached me this week from that region have not arrived. 374 * Deserters and suspects.— Three Indian deserters from Coolie Corps in Mesopotamia have been brought in during the week; one from near Langar, one trom bhanfabad, and one from the city. According to their statements they are : Number 388 Nur, or Nur Muhammad, 4 th Company, 6th Coolie Corps. Resi dent of village Mauza Ahmad Mahaneda, Muzaffargarh District and drafted from Muzanargarh Jail to Mesopotamia. Number 414 Gamah of above company and corps. Resident of Shahidan- wali, Gujrat District. A third man named Mirza deserted with the above two from Amarah but remained behind before the Persian border was reached. Number 1149 Sayyid Faza! Hussain of 10th Coolie Corps to which he was drafted from Lahore Jail, He deserted near Kut-al-Amarah with two others, Kihanah who remained behind at Shah Abdul Azim, Tehran, and Fateh Muham mad who has remained sick at Sabzawar. A look-out will be kept for these. Should local conditions permit, these three men will be despatched to Bir- jand in the charge of a party of Barbari recruits. Reference to paragraphs 369 and 313, the Russians sent in yesterday evening 3 Heratis travelling together, arrested at Turbat-i-Haidari, who were both unfortunate enough to possess the name of Ghulam Raza. Both are elderly men and m no way answer to the description of the individual noted in paragraph 313. They were searched by the Russians, but on their arrival here a number of papers were found sewn in the collars of their coats-apparently charms. They are detained for investigation but at present appear to be innocent travellers. 375. Local ciffa Conditions continue very unsatisfactory, robberies occurring practically in every district. Turkomans from over the Russian border have raided near Sarakhs, Zorabad and Daragez, and robberies by Baluch have a ; so occurred. Travellers move by short stages, avoiding being overtaken by night on the road. &amp; &amp; y Scarcity is felt more severely in country districts. Peaceful villages are providing themselves with arms as far as possible for self-protection, and others are driven by want to join the numerous bands of robbers. The bread question is far from satisfactory and Mutammid-al-Wazara whose integrity sounded too good to be true, has apparently joined forces with S 1867 GSB r /-mr ~t . ■ T* — ■ ■ ' the oowers of evil as represented by the Governor-General and his minions- There is, however, no real scarcity of wheat provided the question were dealt with reasonable honesty. Shaukat-ad-Daula and his brother Shajji-as-Saltanah have patched up a temporary agreement, little likely to endure. One net and for us very impor- tant result of Shaukat’s unauthorised departure from Meshed and subsequent intrigues is the complete cessation of the assistance which we have received in the past’ from Shaiii in intercepting enemy emissaries from Afghanistan. It appears far from unlikely that but for this his men, by scouring bye-paths, would have been successful in intercepting Abdurrahman Khan, whose mission we have reason to believe was a sufficiently important one. The head and fount of all this is undoubtedly the Governor-General during whose tenure no improvement can be expected. An ideal Governor is perhaps hard to find in Persia. It would, however, appear equally difficult to ay hands on one who combines in his person so many characteristics of weak and dis- honest administration as does Naib-as-Saltanah. Recent deaths in the city are ascribed by rumour to cholera. It is to be hoped that the explanation will be found in the fruit season combined with scarce and impure bread. 376. Democrats .—Local democrats are attributing—quite unjustly—many of their difficulties to British influence. An informant who was pressed to join the “ 14th circle ” states that the rules submitted for his guidance were (a) implicit obedience even to executing the death penalty, {b) avoidance of all fre- quentation of the British or Russian Consulates or of persons connected there with, (c) avoidance of conduct calculated to bring discredit on the society, such as gambling, indulgence in wine, or the frequentation of loose women. Disobedi ence of the above involves danger to life. I have also been warned that democrats have been attempting to tamper with sowars of the Consulate Guard, and that a watch is kept on frequenters of the Consulate and houses of certain employes, with the object of detecting pos sible British agents. Herat and Afghanistan. 377. Germans and adherents .—A subadar, accused by Wagner of spitting in his direction as lie passed, has been deported to Kabul. Nasrullah is spreading a rumour of the ejectment of Khorasan, and Kazim Beg received little change from his criticising the Amir’s relations with England. 378. Military .—The Naib Salar continues his crusade against opium and chars smokers. Drastic measures are adopted, obstinate offenders being chained up to prevent their gaining access to the drug when medical treatment and flog ging have failed. Officers, in whose units victims of the drug habit are found after a reasonable interval, will be tried by Court-Martial. Three Taimani sepoys have deserted and cavalry have been sent to appre hend them. A drill-instructor recently promoted to jamadar, convicted of shirk ing in pursuit of robbers, has been dismissed and deported to Kabul; and a company commander who embezzled the grain allowance to the family of a sepoy in hospital has been ordered to replace it six-fold. Russian Turkistan. 379. Current affairs.—Thz closing of the Perso-Russian frontier has resulted in no newspapers, and no letters other than registered ones, being carried by the ordinary post. M. Dorrer left Askhabad for Petrograd on the 5th August to take part in a session of district commissioners. It is understood that he will retain office as Transcaspian Commissioner, at any rate until this session has been completea Russian escort troops from on adversely3 The following prices have been fixed by authority for cereals Transcaspia, with effect from the ist of (Russian) July :— and forage in Price per pud (36 lbs.) Wheat 7 rubles. Barley Hay » 1 i » 3 » Lucerne A recent arrival from Turkistan states that at any rate for the relatively well-to-do with the exception of bread, there was no difficulty in obtaining food supplies. At Askhabad the question is more difficult. Tashkent and Turkistan generally appeared quiet, and railway travelling was reasonably easy. Great annoyance is experienced in the town, especially at places of amusement, from the rough and undisciplined behaviour of soldiers. 380. Military affairs .—From a general telegram of farewell despatched from Krasnovodsk and signed by a number of officers of the 8th Siberian Rifle Reserve Regiment it would appear that this unit has left Askhabad for the front. The regimental committee of the 6th Siberian R. R. Regiment published an ing the despatch of regiments.” As far as can be ascertained the ist, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 8th Siberian R. R. Regiments have left for the front, and it may be assumed that the 4th, 6th and 7th have been retained for local defence. 381. Khiva .—There is no mention of affairs in Khiva in such papers as have come to hand this week, but native rumour has it that ” 600 soldiers and some guns probably a Cossack Regiment with maxim detachment—have been sent there and that the Turkoman are quieter in consequence. An account from a medical officer who participated in the extraordinary Galkin punitive expedition of the spring of last year states that after General Galkin’s arrival at Khiva it was proposed to reinforce him with 6 infantry drujmy 6 batteries, a complete Cossack regiment and 2 extra squadrons, or about 12,000 men. The General protested and eventually 3 drujiny and 5 batteries (presum ably also the Cossacks) were sent. There was practically no resistance and about 20 Russians were killed in all. Initial disorders were apparently no more serious than those reported at present, and the difference between the force enu merated above and that now considered sufficient is sufficiently striking. * It may be recalled that the Ural Cossacks, a battery, and some infantry were to have reinforced the Khorasan troops in 1916 but that in consequence of the call for Khiva they were countermanded. indignant denial of the rumour that this unit had refused to proceed to the front, and states that all ranks were bitterly disappointed by the order “ countermand- MESHED ; 18th August igif.

Russian force .—Colonel Gustchin intends shortly to relieve the squad ron based on Rain with one from here. He has despatched the squadron com- mander from Turbat-i-Haidari to re-examine the posts thence southwards, and to enquire into the circumstances of the recent robberies in the vicinity of Amrani. The main difficulty in guarding this portion of the road lies in the fact that in the long desert stretch between Mehneh and Amrani no suitable site for an intermediate post exists. 1 he question of establishing an alternative line ma Faizabad—slightly longer but probably admitting of an intermediate post—is under consideration. For this measure to be effective it would be necessary to prevail on the Persian postal authorities to abandon the road followed at present for the new variant. . The Adjutant of the regiment, who has just returned from a short visit to Tiflis, received an unfavourable impression from the lack of discipline and order prevailing there, which might be expected to strike a new-comer. 383. Jamshadis.— One Hajji Muhammad from Shah Nishin informed an agent that he had seen Sayyid Ahmad Beg with some 20 followers at the house of Nasrullah Khan Zorabadi on the night of the 9th August. The following day Sayyid Ahmad Beg returned to Sher Tapa from Zorabad. No further ^news regarding him has come to hand this week. The Herat agent notes the plunder ing of a caravan coming from Badghis but gives no details as to the aggressors. The Military Agent regards the failure of the General Staff to reply to his telegrams as tantamount to an admission that Sayyid Ahmad has escaped from Russian surveillance. 384. Suspects and deserters ,—The two Heratis noted in paragraph 374 appearing perfectly innocent except in regard to their names, were duly released. The Russians have recently received photographs reputed to be those of Mohendro Partap. These have been distributed among posts, and yesterday a Persian Munshi, arrested on the strength of a superficial resemblance, was sent here for identification. I hope that the letter returned with the suspect to the Military Agent was efficacious in securing the unfortunate man’s speedy re lease. From Herat we hear that Nur Muhammad Khan has returned safely to the Bagh-i-Kartah, but greatly to Wagner’s indignation, without the expected letter. The Kushk authorities have missed another chance, as making due allowance for the time occupied on the journey and for news of the man’s return to reach us the man must have been at least 10 days in or about Panjdeh after telegraphic warning had been conveyed to them. The disorganisation both of the tele graphs and of the police, however, renders any efficient co-operation practically hopeless. Two more deserters from coolie corps have been brought in from Sharifabad and, together with the three here, will be sent to our post at Sehdeh under Russian escort shortly. Their names are from their statements : Number 188 Coolie Khan Muhammad of 6th Coolie Corps, resident of village Lakala, P. O. Nawabpur, District Multan. Drafted from Multan Jail to Meso potamia and deserted alone from Qut-al-Amarah. Number 1345 Coolie Rehanah of 10th Coolie Corps, resident of Thata Alika, P. O. Khangah, District Gujranwala. Drafted from Gujranwala Jail to Mesopotamia, and deserted from Sheikh Sadi. Reports having met another coolie deserter named Muhammad on the road from Tehran, who remained behind sick at Shah ud.It is perhaps worth noting that all of these Labour Corps deserters who 3” tr;, r 1 N - c - &lt; ‘ l k “ l ment involving frequent beatings by the latter.

A Tiflis telegram in the “Turkistan News” of the 7th instant (received on the -oth instant here) mentions the occurrence of some 20 cases on the Kara Su on the Persian side of the Russo-Persian border, and cases are reported from Herat and Afghanistan. 3S6. Germans and aakerenU.-lte followers of the German party are adorn- ng various precautions to keep their doings from the ears of the Bntisb \gent. Haiti Ghulam Hussain, the kslantar of Herat druggists continues his re ations with them. He has confirmed the withdrawal ot the Russian detachmen rom Jam, and indicated our agent as their greatest source ot danger. Among the rumours set going by the followers are the capture oi Egpt ind the s.ege of Bombay by Turco-German forces. The Heratis are, How ^er, now very sceptical as to these utterances. The Froftth of Wagner’s unpopularity loca’.'.y, which he apparently makes &gt;very effort to increase, may yet be an asset to us directy or indirectly. The dismissal of the Subadar, noted last week, for alleged disrespect ■ o Wagner, evoked the greatest indignation in his urn. the battalion, * The matter must have been regarded as serious by the Nmb Kistilv substituted a furlough for the dismissal mete _ o-t .0 ...

Wagner beat the owner-i sold e -an. was wi.n dissuaded from hauling turn before the Naib balar for contng p ment.In this connection it is fairly evident from all reports that the Naib-ul-Huk- umah not only displays more firmness with regard to the Germans’ various demands than the Naib Salar, but is also far more sceptical as to their news than his colleague. The explanation may perhaps besought in the advice on military matters which the latter receives from Wagner—an arrival states that it is commonly supposed that the numerous discharges of more or less inefficient men are due to German instigation. Wagner is now credited with the intention of availing himself of the Naib Salar’s influence to secure the return from Kabul! of the young German (variously known as “ Ya” or “ Ott” Query, Otto Iyer?) concerning whose departure he was much concerned. 387. Discipline .—The Colonel of the 9th Herati Infantry—Muhammad Kazim Khan—has been dismissed for embezzling the pay of one of his men on leave. The Kumaidan and Major of the battalion have also been transferred to the 3rd Herati battalion, and an artillery Kumaidan brought in place of the former. At Durbar the Naib Salar subsequently read his officers a homily on their duties. He said that promotion was the reward of good service, but that no recipient of such honour should think himself secure, as backsliding would be punished with inevitable degradation. 388. Barracks .—The stables of the 3rd Herati battalion having been found more commodious than their barracks, orders have been given to convert one into the other, and the work is in progress. 389. Russian intelligence .—The Military Agent has received a telegram from the General Staff, Tashkent, requesting him to verify a report that the Amir is held a prisoner at Jalalabad, and that his son and brother are in practical control of the country, and another announcing the arrival of 350 camels with arms and ammunition at Herat of which we have received no intelligence. He ascribes both those reports to the misdirected zeal of M. Bulatov, Russian Vice- x K^rtervw&gt;-o Consul at Birjand. (Reference paragraph 281.) It w^oidd be a distinct ad van- tage if this official could be induced to submit his Afghan intelligence to the kind offices of our Consular representatives in Sistan for confirmation before setting going “ hares ” of such magnitude. 390. Consaiption. —Reports have been received of an attempt at forcible application of the conscription on the 1 per 8 basis of inhabitants of the Mazar-i- Sharif province, and of the flight from their lands of the people affected. Simi lar intelligence has reached the Russians. 391. Stores .—An arrival reports the receipt at Herat from Kabul of 8,00a pairs of boots for the garrison. This may have been the foundation of M. Bul atov’s report referred to above. Russian Turkistan. 392. Current affairs .— M. Nalivkin (paragraph 320) has been appointed President of the Turkistan Committee in succession to M. Stchepkin. Apparently most of the original members of the Committee have also been changed.. Preparations for elections in the principal towns, in connection wdth the recently announced granting of town constitutions, are on foot. Arrangements for a fresh census of Turkistan aie in progress. The present moment would not appear a very suitable one. In spite of the reopening of the frontier, posts remain hopelessly disorga nised, and practically no letters, or even local newspapers, have been received here for the last fortnight. 393. Military affairs .—The immediate return to the colours of ad soldiers, in Turkistan on leave from, or permitted to be absent on agricultural w r ork from, the Caucasus Army has been ordered. An order published in the Askhabad garrison prohibiting soldiers from wear- I ing in the streets irregular or slovenly uniform is perhaps a hopeful augury of the re-establishment of interior discipline..394 - Turkomans .—Various Turkoman communities are now repudiating their office holders elected by themselves under the auspices of Khan Yomudski, pretexting irregularities in electoral procedure. 395. Mineral resources .—A company styled “ Naptha Dag” has been formed for the exploitation near the mountain of that name in Transcaspia of oil deposits. Its capital is placed at 2 million rubles.

The Russian Military Agent has placed at my disposal a report on Afghanistan recently rendered by him to the General Staff, Tashkent, of which I forward the following extracts : Conscription and recruiting .—Acting on categorical orders from Kabul to proceed energetically wkh the levy of 1 per 8 of the male population, the Naib- ul-Hukumah of Mazari-Sharif decided to employ force to overcome the passive resistance of the people to the measure. As a result the population in districts affected deserted their dwellings and lands, and a number crossed the Russian frontier. The Governor of Andldiui reported to the Naib-ul-Hukumah that in consequence scarcely half of the population in his district was left, and other district governors have reported in a similar sense. The reports have been forwarded to Kabul with a request for further instructions, and in the meantime the unpopular measure has been discontinued. Some 3 months ago Colonels Mir Osman Khan and Muhammad Anvar Khan were despatched from Kabul to the Kandahar district to encourage recruiting which was giving very unsatisfactory results. They succeeded in pbtaining some 600 recruits from whom a battalion—Paltan-i-Jadid—was pro posed to be formed. These men are not yet equipped but are being drilled, and may possibly be employed to fill vacancies in existing units. Arms and equipment .—The Kandahari Battalion at Mazar-i-Sharif has been armed with magazine rifles received from Kabul. These are y-shot Kabul made arms. (Reference Intelligence Summary No. 11, paragraph 155.) Cadres .—At Kandahar the new corps formed from khasadars with n strength of 1,800 men has been disposed as follows: 645 men drafted into the 3 Kandahar infantry battalions to complete strengths ; 2 battalions, named respectively the 1st and 2nd Khassadari-i-Jadid formed from the remainder. There are thus 5 infantry battalions at Kandahar at present. (Reference Intelli gence Summary, paragraphs 247 and 302.) Garrisons. —Ghazni.

The Ghazni garrison is commanded by General Janbaz Khan. 3 Battalions, i cavalry regiment, 6 mountain guns, and 6 maxims, with some hundreds of khavanin are disposed to the E. and S. of Ghazni under a Brigadier at Urgun who is subordinate to the O. C. Ghazni. N, and N. E. of Ghazni 2 battalions, i squadron, and 400 khavanin are also distributed. Mazar-i-Sharif. There are now 4 cavalry regiments and 2 independent squadrons bringing the total of regular cavalry to 1,800. There are 1,500 khavanin of whom 600 are at Kabul. 59 old brass guns have been removed from the Dehdadi defences to store. (Here he states that the Kandahari battalion have been re-armed with 11- shot magazine rifles. See supra.) Girishk. 2 companies each of the Nurzai and Herati battalions from Kan dahar* form a composite battalion under command of Colonel Mahmud Shah Khan. In addition at Girishk are ioo Barbari khasadars, 300 khavanin, 1 6- gun battery of field M. L. guns, and 1 6-gun battery of mountain “ side-loader” guns. * By his reckoning the Nurzai and Herati battalions have each 800 men at Kandadar plus 200 each at Girishk. Kandahar and district. —Punitive troops have been withdrawn from Zamin- davar with exception of 1 company of infantry and 100 cavalry. 150 arrested rebels have been despatched to Kabul. Plague broke out at Kandahar at the end of May, and created consider able ravages. Many inhabitants left and about 350 soldiers died. Many of the new formed corps from khasadars died but accurate figures have not been receiv ed. The outbreak is now at an end. {N. Z?.—Typhus reported by British Agent ?) Germans in Afghanistan. —The Austrians and Germans at Kabul were removed about 2 months ago to Aliabad outside the city, an exception being made only for those who had adopted the Moslem religion and for those work ing in factories. They are guarded by 3 sections of infantry and 20 cavalry.. 8 of them escaped soon after but were recaptured. 4 Kabuli rupees per diem are allowed for subsistence of each man. 3 of the 6 Germans at Herat were sent to Kabul at the beginning of June, the rumour being that the Amir wished to avail himself of their technical skill. There is reason to believe that Yandi, Grodan, and Frantz were the men sent, but from other sources it is possible that 3 Austrian fugitives were sent. . (A^. B. —The latter correct according to our information.) The majority of Germans in Afghanistan are diligently studying Persian under native teachers. The Afghan authorities are gradually limiting more and more the freedom of movement of the Austrians and Germans, imposing restrictions on their excur sions and walks both in country and city. Wagner has more than once been un successful in obtaining concessions from the Naib-ul-Hukumah who abides strictly by instructions received from Kabul. He and the others at Herat are well posted in war news, and maintain a regular correspondence with prisoners in Russian Turkistan, Jew traders being frequent intermediaries. Plot against the Amir. —A criminal society was founded at Kabul in June with the object of securing the deposition of the Amir and the introduction of a constitutional government. Three sons of Omar Khan Bajauri were implicated. These fled to India, but about 10 arrests were made. The families of the Bajauris were deported to Mazar-i-Sharif. Great secrecy is said to be observed in regard to this affair. Taking the attempt on the Amir’s life of last Decemberinto account, and the plot against him in which his nephew Mhamrnad Azim Khan was implicated, it is obvious that the Amir has some reasou to fear for his personal safety. Russian and English goods in Afghanistan .—Russian goods have practi cally disappeared from Afghan markets. English goods on the other hand, of which formerly few were noted in N. Afghanistan, are now abundant in the marts of Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, Maimana, and other important places in N. Afghani stan. They are about 10 times cheaper than Russian goods. Rumours .—Even the most intelligent Afghan officials seem unable to grasp the true significance of the Russian revolution and the manner in which it will affect Russo-Afghan relations. Persistent rumours are current of the conclusion of a separate peace between Russia and Germany, which would throw the whole burden of the war on England. It is thought that estrangement between England and Russia, which might ensue, would place the former country in a very dangerous position. E. A. F. REDL, Lieut .-Colonel y G. S. 0 .

German Emissaries and Adherents. i (1) It is reported from Kala Kang that one German and one Turk arrived there from Farah on the 31st August. They stayed with the Governor one night and with the Brigadier two nights. They then left for Kandahar, escorted by 10 Afghan sowars who will hand, them over to Sardar Muhammad Aslam Khan at Rezai. (2) On 1st September, Captain Uloth, Commanding troops at Birjand, heard from Rum (? through M. Boulatoff) that the Russian Commander at Kain had warned all his posts that one Turkish officer, 20 Turkish soldiers and 20 Persians all mounted were in the neighbourhood making for Afghanistan. On 4th Sep tember Lieutenant Svetonosoff wired from Kain to Lieutenant Brenan, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Birjand, in reply to the latter’s telegraphic enquiry : — ‘ ‘ I had received information that a party of Turks had been defeated below Kerman and that 20 men were making for Afghanistan. I have no other information ”! (3) A man of (eastern) Tabas who left Herat on the 20th August has stated that there is only one German there now, the others having been sent to Kabul by the Deputy Governor under escort. (4) See Diaries Nos. 33 and 34. I hear from Kerman that the reports that Germans are returning there are being assiduously but secretly spread by a clique headed by an individual whom the Tehran authorities insisted on returning to Kerman last November. I will try to get some evidence against these mischief- makers, on which perhaps the Military Police in Kerman can take action. News from Afghanistan. (1) An arrival from Afghan Turkistan states that Sardar Abdullah Khan, Muhammadzai, is trying to enlist 10,000 recruits to fight against the British. (2) Gurgich Baluchis of Haji son of Gulab’s section are committing raids into the Narui tract of Sistan (Sardar Khudadad Khan’s). Several camels, donkeys and cattle have been carried off. (3) It is said that the Afghan authorities are offering 200 Tomans for a good rifle. (4) See Diary No. 32. I hear that Sardars Wazir Khan and Nazar Muham mad Khan are still in custody. Khuda Nazar Khan has been released on payment of 32,000 Krans. These individuals, I am now told, got into trouble for selling wheat to the British authorities. (5) An officer has come from Kandahar to Kala-i-Kang ‘ ‘ to reward the Vakil 8 who have supplied recruits to the army, and to maintain them in their estate 3 while non-sympathizers with Islam are to be harassed. The Persian Post. I heard on 1st September through Birjand, after instituting some enquiries about a missing letter that a postal bag, which left Birjand on 6th August, was lost between Sahlabad and Shusp ! Later I have been informed that the bag■5 contained five registered covers for (1) the Finance Agent (2) myself (3) the Officer Commandmg at Sistan, (4) the Supply and Transport Agent, Sistan, and (5) a trader. ^ On 4th September news reached Birjand that seven fatal cases of cholera had occurred at Khidri on the Khorasan border. On the 6th September six cases of cholera were reported from Burjd (8 miles from Birjand). I n Sistan a committee has been formed to combat the epidemic.

It appears that the rumour about a Turkish party having reached the neighbourhood of Kam had its origin in a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman to His Majesty s Consul-General at Meshed announcing that Obeidullah Pasha and Hasan Khan Buchakchi with 12 followers were making fpr Khorasan after having had a brush with the South Persia Rifles (near Yezd '?). 1 (2) An arrival from Meshed states that about a month ago he saw some six or seven tents pitched at Robat-i-Sufaid (43 miles north of Turbat-i-Haidari on the Meshed road). He was informed that the travellers were foreigners going to Tabas and Tun. He did not learn their nationality. Cholera in Kainat. During the week six fresh cases and three deaths have been reported from Khidri,' 14 fresh cases and 9 deaths at Bujd, two cases at Furk-Darmian and one or two cases near Sarbisha. Under the advice of Senior Sub-Assistant Surgeon Khan Bahadur Mirza Muhammad Beg and M. Vladimiroff, the Medical Officers attached to the British and Russian Vice-Consulates, a cordon has been placed round Bujd village. Colonel Dale has gone up the road to arrange precautions for the safety of his detachments. Major Heron will assist him, and will also advise the local authorities at each stage. News from Afghanistan. . i ' (1) It is said that the Alizai tribe who had revolted have been pardoned and restored to their estates. An officer named Kumedan Muhammad Wali Khan has been dealing with their affairs. He is also trying to repopulate a] town on the Nahr-i-Ibrahim near Bakwa. (2) One hundred Baluch families are said to have reached Chakhansur from Russian Turkestan wd Herat, and others are following. Thirty famdies have also arrived in Khwaja Ahmed (in Persian Sistan).

The same posts are held as before on above lines and in the same strength. There are at present no other Russian troops in Khorasan. 375. Escaped prisoners.— On the night of the 31st July-ist August 2 individuals were noted in the Shrine precincts by both our own and Russian agents as probable escaped prisoners of war from Russia. They were, however, taken by the Persian police to the Karguzari whence the Military Age,nt obtained delivery of them after some demur on the part of the Karguzar. They proved to be Bulgarians, captured in Dobruja, who had escaped from Ekaterinoslav, had succeeded in crossing the Caspian to Krasnovodsk, and in making their way from some point on the railway between that place and Askhabad to the Persian frontier. As they scarcely know any Russian an unchecked journey of such a length would prove a matter of surprise in any other country. 376. ^amshedis .—About a week ago a report reached me that a man named Sayyid Ahmad Beg had escaped from Russia and was in the Jam region with a band of followers with the intention of robbing on the Herat road. Fur ther enquiries established his identity with the notorious Jamshedi of that name, the author of the raid on Afghanistan from Russian territory in November, 1909, but failed to produce direct evidence as to his presence on Persian soil. The following circumstances tend to render the correctness of the report possible:— (a) The passage of the mysterious horsemen noted in paragraph 359. Neither the locality in which they were reported nor their procedure points to their being Turkomen en route for Afghanistan. (ti) A statement in the “ Askhabad ” that Jamshedis domiciled in the Atek and Takhta Bazar districts were leaving their places of residence, their predatory habits not finding favour with their Turkoman neighbours. (c) The demeanour of Sayyid Ahmad Beg himself after his capture by the Russians and internment at Samarkand, when he vowed eternal vengeance on the Afghans and declared his intention of raiding from Persian territory if not permitted to do so from Russian. Against, it is the fact that neither from Kariz nor the Jam district have any confirmatory reports come to hand. Owing to the dispute between Shaukat-ed- Daulah and his brother Shajji-as-Saltanah, which appears to be nearing a crisis, and generally disturbed conditions attributable to the presence of lawless in dividuals and general scarcity, the arrival of a new element of unrest might escape notice for longer than in normal times. The General Staff at Tashkent have been asked to furnish the latest infor mation as to Ahmad Beg’s movements, and meanwhile local enquiries are being made. Herat and Afghanistan. 377. Germans and Information of Abdurrahman s safe passage through Meshed toward Tehran has been received from Herat. ij j u i.^Messenger traffic seems fairly brisk. One Nur Mohammad Khan (pre« sumably No. 22 on list attached to Int. Sum. No. 6) is reported to have been sent to Panjdeh to post a letter to a German friend at Petrograd and to await an answer. The advantage of capturing both messenger and reply has been impressed on the Russians, and the Military Agent has telegraphed to Kushk. The arrival at Herat is reported of two messengers sent from Kabul to obtain news of Mesopotamian doings, on completion of their mission. The British Agent mentions an unconfirmed rumour that the departure of Wagner and Kazim Beg to Mazar-i-Sharif, to await a favourable opportunity for passage to Russian territory, is possible. Reference to the report of “ German ” officers noted in paragraph 349 the British Agent at Herat states that enquiries on the matter have failed to obtain any confirmation. He states that the Naib Salar has some 6 officers styled 4 ‘parvanah ” attached to him whom he employs on confidential inspections, frequently on the frontier. These persons are graduates of the Kabul Military School, are of fair complexion, and dress in uniform of European out and wear sola topis. He is of opinion that they might easily be confounded by ignorant persons with faranghis,” and there seems good ground for this surmise. 378. Military.—h ceromonial parade of the garrison dressed in new khaki uniform was held on the occasion of the Ramazan ’Id. Mullahs attached to units appeared in khaki robes. Some slight contretemps over the artillery salute occurred, resulting in the beating of the captain of a battery by his colonel, The Naib Salar remarked that the incident was unfortunate but reserved his judg ment. He is instituting a crusade against gambling among the men and those convicted of it, together with opium and “ chars ” smokers, will be deported. The same penalty will be inflicted on traders dealing in “ chars.' 379. Khavanin .—In accordance with zfarman emanating from the Naib* as-Saltanah, leaders of “standards “ (unit of about 100 men) of khavanin have been instructed to weed out old men and to replace them with young. Russian Turkistan. 380. Current affairs .—Apparently some disorder must have occurred at Tashkent as on the 20th July the Executive Committee of Workmen and Soldiers Delegates issued an appeal against any renewal of disorder or plunder of shops, warning all inhab’tants against counter-revolutionary intrigues, and stating that strict measures of reprisal would be taken. The Turkistan Committee also prohibited open air meetings between the 19th and 22nd July, and specified various other regulations calculated to preserve order among both soldiers and civilians. The arrest of 2 soldiers at Osh lead to the discovery of a large criminal gang at Tashkent and in North East Turkistan. The appointment of Lieutenant Solomon as Russo-Persian Frontier Com missioner is cancelled by an order of the 13th July. 381. Military affairs.—'Ry an order dated the 21st July, Colonel Cherkes is promoted to Major-General, and appointed to the command of the Turkistan Military District—an appointment carrying with it the honorary Atamanship of the Semirechia Cossack Voisko. Lieutenent-General Madritov is transferred from his appointment as Military Governor of Semirechia, and Ataman of the Semirechia Cossack Voisko, to the reserve of the staff of the Petrograd District. At a sitting of the Turkistan Committee of theiith July, the following steps were resolved on, after hearing and discussion of reports on these heads (0) Withdrawal of troops on the Gurgan. A special local commission to be appointed, and the period within which the troops were to bewithdrawn to be determined by the members in conjunction with the military authorities. {b) Despatch of Cossacks to Khiva in such proportion as the Officer Commanding the Turkistan Military District considered necessary and could dispose of. Colonel Trisna, president of a commission recently despatched to Khiva, to be granted full executive powers due notice being given to the Khan. {c') Withdrawal of units from Semirechia inadvisable in view of present disturbed conditions. Military members refrained from voting on this measure. ^ Cenera Cherkes publishes an order from the Minister cf War directing him to repress all disorder or insubordination among troops and in case of necessity to take the strongest measures without awaiting further instructions. He expresses the hope that no necessity for such action will arise. A farewell Mass was held at Tashkent on the 23rd ultimo prior to the departure of the 2nd Siberian Rifle Reserve Regiment for the front. a . u D , raf J ts f&lt; ? r th . e , front have been despatched by the 8th S.

Askhabad^ ^ C ^ eSerters, a somew hat formal nature, was recently organised at An arrival from Kahka states that during a recent 3 days stay civilian passengers and private goods were refused on the railway. A large number of Cossacks passed through towards Krasnovodsk. According to' local rumour there was trouble in the Caucasus. 3S2. AA^.—According to the Press, raiding and burning, by Yomud lurkoman in the Kuivan Khanate has assumed serious proportions. The town • a D ^ ee * n P^ un ^ ere( ^ an ^ burnt, and New Urganj is said to be threaten- ff* • Russian-owned works have been burned and a steamer of the Khiva Company fired on. The Russian colony at New Urgani have telegraphed to the authorities that both Russian lives and property were endangered, and requested the speedy despatch of mounted troops, as infantry detachments on the spot were useless against the mobile raiders. Up to the 22nd ultimo the troops, whose despatch was resolved on above, had evidently not been sent. Russian colonies in oriental countries are not infrequently unduly nervous, but rumours current here tend to confirm their apprehensions, and add that the Khivan Turkoman are being reinforced by others from outside the Khanate intent on plunder. General Galkin’s punitive expedition against the Khivan Turkomans last year, prolific in hangings and forced contributions, and which was apparently the cause of the sudden termination of that official’s career, is generally consider ed to have contributed towards the present outbreak. 383.

In view of the growing frequency of robberies in and round Kokand, it has been decided to arm the police militia with rifles, and to undertake the foimation of Bands of Public Safety who will also be armed with rifles. Some dismay has been caused by the report of the failure of the harvest in the Samara region, and the consequent probability that grain reckoned on thence for Turkistan will not be supplied. The want of success attained by the adoption of summer time in Turkis tan indicates to some extent the lack of social discipline existent. At Askhabad some have adopted summer time and others adhere to the former ; at Tashkent various commercial institutions evade the new regulations in the simplest manner by commencing and stoping work an hour later than before. 370. Military. —The last echelon of the 2nd Siberian Reserve Rifle Regiment left Tashkent for the front on the 27th July. The 3rd Siberian Reserve Rifle Regiment has also been ordered to the front, and has presumably left Turkistan by now. A ” Death Battalion ” is being formed at Tashkent in which many Turkistan settlers, exempted by law from military service, are enlisting. 371. Khiva .—In view of the growth of disorder in the Khivan Khanate, Colonel Trisna has been instructed by the authorities to act with resolution, employing if necessary armed force, arrests, and deportations. The plunder of the towm of Kungrad by the Turkomans is reported. Native rumours of a serious situation in Khiva are rife. Ansari Turkoman are said to be plundering in Bokhara, and general unrest among Turkoman is indicated. Owing to delayed posts this week recent news is unobtainable. 372. Semirechia. —Owing to the maximalist outbreak the authorities have decided to remove “ white ticket ” men and men of the 40 years of age category involved, and to strengthen the Russian garrison in the province.

K- L. Meshed Diary No. 32, for the week ending the llfh August 1917. 1. Persian officials. —Haji Murtaza Kuli, the new Mutwali Bashi of the Shrine, (paragraph 3 last week), has arrived and assumed office. It has been ordered from Tehran that his predecessor, Zahir-ul-Islam, should not be allowed to leave Meshed until he has rendered his accounts satisfactorily. 2. The following appointments have been made Shahzadah Shuja-us- Sultan to be Governor of Sabsawar vice Murtaza Kuli, and his brother Asadullah Mirza to be in charge of Sabsawar temporarily : Abdullah Mirza, a younger bjrother of the same family, to be Governor of Khaf. These men are all mojderate democrats. 3. The local democrats have prevailed upon the Governor-General to dismiss the head of his office and to appoint a friend of their own, Mirza Abdul Husain, in his place. For this “ job ” 400 tumans have been paid, 4. Persian affairs (local).—Nothing more has occurred in connection with the grain and bread difficulties. There is sufficient revenue grain in stock for some days issue : when it is exhausted another crisis may be expected unless the proprietors are compelled to part with some portion of their stores (paragraph 8, last week). 5. The Officer Commanding the local troops has telegraphed to the War Minister urging the payment of his men who have received nothing for four months. He calls attention to the impossibility of keeping them in hand unless they are paid regularly (paragraph 7, last week), 6. M. Delcorde has kindly sent me a copy of a telegram which he has received from Tehran prohibiting absolutely the export of all cereals, rice, cattle, stores, and provisions of all kinds. 7. M. Kornelis has requested the Chief of Police to pay into his office the money realised from shopkeepers monthly to cover the expenses of the town night guards, This tax has apparently been the perquisite of the police hitherto, although the Revenue Department pays the wages of the guards in the monthly police budget. The Chief of Police has replied that if the Revenue Department takes this money he can no longer be responsible for the safety of the shops at night ! 8. Two selected members of the Union and Progress Society have arrived from Tehran with the object of organising a local branch (paragraph 9, last week), They have already secured local sympathisers in the persons of Mirza Ahmad Khan, an assistant in the Karguzari, Ptimad-ul-Wizarah Darban Bashi of the Shrine, and Muhandis Hamayun, the latter two of whom have also recently returned from Tehran. Active steps are being taken to compete with the democrats. 9. One Rajab Ali, a Kurd, while in confinement in the Nazmiah on a charge of sheep stealing, gave a pair of shoes to a policeman with instructions to sell them and buy bread for him. The shoes, however, were recognised by the relative of one of three persons recently murdered on the Layan road by a Kurd as being his property. Rajab Ali subsequently confessed to this crime. 10. Persian affairs (general). —A number of the inhabitants of Radkan village came some days ago to the telegraph office at Chinaran and sent several telegrams to the Governor-General complaining of their Governor by whose'orders one of their friends had been put to death, After waiting some time for a reply which did not come, they left the office, and entering the Ark murdered the Governor. (This Governor is a son-in-law of the head munshi at the Russian Consulate-General. 11. The Governor of Khaf (paragraph 14, last week) has fled from Khaf to Karez, and Mir Yusuf has returned to Khaf and taken up his quarters in the Ark, The rebels had taken great precautions to (defend the town and themselves in the event of attack, but we hear a late report (without details) that they have been ildispersed and their leader Haji Mujtaba wounded. Meanwhile another Governor has been appointed. Haji Mujtaba has telegraphed to the Governor-General representing that the Karguzar of Turbat-i-Haidari, aided by the Imperial Bank’s Agent Haji Agha Muhammad, is responsible for all that has occurred. 12. The people of Sarakhs being in great trouble on account of scarcity have telegraphed to Tehran begging for help from Government, in default of which they will be compelled to emigrate. 13. The presence of. four active highwaymen is reported at Vakilabad on the Turkobai-Meshed road. 14. British affairs. —Shuja-ud-Daulah has paid yet another thousand tumans of his debt to the Imperial Bank (paragraph 16, last week). 15. Russian affairs—My Colleague has received several telegrams during the week on the subject of the water dispute on the Daragez and Khelat frontiers (paragraph 20, last week). The last says that according to information received 'ind. Tashkent the Turkomans have not even drinking water. It is suggested (bv Tashkent) that unless early action is taken the Turkomans will take the law into their own hands. Our Karguzar proposes to a joint commission to settle the difficulty. 16. Persian and German intrigues.— ma'de during the week by pro minent democrats to have Munshi hsizam (paragraph 11 of Diar^ Aio. 28) appoint ed. first, Chief of Karasuran, and then second-in-command of the local forces, have been unsuccessful. The Governor-General adheres to his promise to us to ■'give him no post. 17. Certain news from Tehran suggesting a recrudescence there of British influence and the closing of the Russian frontiers (which is held to portend some movement opposed to democratic interests) have combined to depress the local democrat society, many of whose members failed to attend the meetings held during the past week. There is moreover a want of unity which is becoming more apparent day by day. 18. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—Yhis district is in great disorder. One caravan has been robbed in the neighbourhood of Mehvalat, and another, also coming from Kerman, at a distance of two farsakhs only from Turbat; while 1,000 tumans in cash have been plundered from a post carriage on the Turshiz-Gunabad road. 19. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh-Jam. —The deputation sent to Jam by the Governor-General has not yet returned with the brothers Shaukat-ud-Daulah and Shaji-us-Saltanah (paragraph 25 of Diary No. 31) ; but some days ago Haji Husain Agha received a petition signed by a number of Taimuris, etc., representing their desire for Shaukat-ud-Daulah as Governor of Jam. This he sent to the Governor-General who passed it on to me asking what he should do. I coun selled him to wait as a similar document would doubtless come from the other party also. This duly arrived on the 7th : it bore the names of an even greater number of people of the district. Kamran Mirza has now asked Shuza-ul-Mulk, the able Governor of the adjoining district of Bakharz, to keep an eye on Jam while the brothers come to Meshed. It is hoped that Shaji’s return to Jam and the appointment of Shaukat elsewhere may Jultimately be arranged. Late reports state that the Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan abruptly quitted Jam on the appearance of the deputation, and that the latter have succeeded in bringing Shaji back from Mahmudabad and arranging a truce between the brothers. 20. News from Karez. —The Governor is putting up some passive resistance to the proposed' despatch of wheat to Meshed; and the unfortunate Revenue officer has been threatened with dismissal and other punishments in case he fails to des patch it within a short time. He cannot obtain the necessary transport. 21. News from Herat. —The arrival of 20 more Baluch families, emigrating from Turkestan on account of scarcity, is reported. They have been sent to the Chakh- ansur district where they will be allowed to remain on giving the usual undertaking not to leave Afghanistan.22. Commendable action against robbers in the Ziaratgah hills and near Kobat-i-Surkh has resulted in the capture of four men. 23. A Herati has reported to the Naib-ul-Hukumah that his brother has been murdered by robbers near Fariman in Khorasan, and the Naib has referred to Abdullah Khan, the Amir’s trade agent. (This is one of the persons referred to in paragraph 20 of Diary No. 30.) 24. Wagner paid the Naib-ul-Hukumah a visit on 29th July which lasted for about an hour. The object was to induce him to allow the Austrian, whose removal to Kabul had been ordered, to remain at Herat. He was not successful. The Naib refused to give way (paragraph 23 of Diary No. 30). 25. A man dressed as a Turk has been sent in from Kafir Killa. He appears to be a Baluch named Salih Khan who states that he went to Turkey eight years ago from Shorawak in the Kandahar district, of which he was an inhabitant: that he joined the Turkish forces on the outbreak of war and was sent with nine Turks to Afghanistan : that the party did not get further than Kermanshah, and that he returned from thence to the Caucasian front and was taken prisoner by the Russians. After confinement in Russia for a year he escaped and came to Kafir Killa via Meshed on foot. 26. Kazim Beg’s servant Asghar states that a letter sent by Abdmr-Rahman after his arrival in Tehran has reached Herat, but there has scarcely been time for that. The writer is said to have remarked that he had not yet been received by the Shah but would let them know when he had. He is reported to have sent presents from Meshed for the Nazir of the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 27. On the 1st August the Naib-ul-Hukumah’despatched to Kabul Muhammad, the escaped Turk (paragraph 29 of Diary No, 29), the Austrian mentioned in para graph 24 above, and the recent arrival (paragraph 25 above), in charge of 8 khaiva- nin sotvars, having supplied them with ponies to ride and the wherewithal for the journey. The 11th August 1917. Meshed ; W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, ! G. M. Press Simla—No. C. 344 F.D —13 9-17—29—-M.B.G.CONFIDENTIAL. I\ Meshed Diary No. 33 for the week ending the 18th August 1917. 1. Persian -Murtaza Kuli, the new Mutwali Bashi of the Shrine (paragraph 1, last week), has paid tumans 5,000 for his post, and Agha Kaim Mukam ed a friend to render them for him, but apparently expects to be reappointed shortly. 2. It seems that one Amid-ud-Daulah has been put forward for the Governor ship of Sabsawar by the Home Secretary, and that the appointment of Shuja-us- Sultan (paragraph 2, last week) is not certain. Meanwhile the latter has paid tumans 500 in advance to the Governor-General and promises to pay 250 monthly so long as he remains in the post. These good terms have naturally secured the support of His Excellency. 3. It is rumoured that certain townspeople intend to take sanctuary in the telegraph office as a protest against the retention of the post of Governor- General by Kamran Mirza : but we hear that the Shah has formally promised to dismiss him in the event of the newly appointed pshkar finding it impossible to work with him, as others have done. 4. Nusrat Khakan, the late Governor of Kuh Payat, has been appointed Governor of Badkan (paragraph 10 last week). 5. Najd-ud-Daulah, the late Governor of Khaf, has arrived in Meshed. 6. Persian affairs (local). —We'have discovered that the Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah is concerned in intrigues against M. Kornelis, and that he has the support of Kamran Mirza. They have arranged for a fresh Press campaign against Kornelis, which is proceeding vigorously. The reason is clear. The revenue grain, issued from the Maliyah at tumans 15 per kharvar, is actually sold by the Ma’tamid at nearly twice that amount, and the surplus proceeds are divided among the two men mentioned and such others as may be convenient. Little or no grain is taken from private owners, who are well content to wait until they can ask any price they please for their stores. Meanwhile the revenue grain is rapidly becoming exhausted ; hence ^ the necessity for demanding supplies, which can be ill spared, from outlying districts. M. Nicolsky and I have telegraphed to Tehran begging that Government may be pressed to transfer the Ma’tamid to some small independent charge elsewhere; in the event of which M. Kornelis had himself promised to take sole charge of the grain and bread questions : but I hear to-day (August the 18th) that he has just received somewhat peremptory orders from Tehran to have noth ing more to do with them as they are the concern of the local government. It is difficult to say what developments will ensue from this, but at present Kor nelis talks ©f resigning his post and returning to the Customs Administration. 7. The commander of the local troops has telegraphed to Tehran that his men are urgently m need of new clothing, and asks for a Government grant to provide it. 8. Three Kurds have been brought in to Meshed and confined in the Nazmiah on suspicion of being concerned in the murder of the late Governor of Radkan (paragraph 10 last week) i and one Ghulam Ah Khan has been arrested and imprisoned for complicity in the events at Khaf reported in this office Diary No. 31, paragraph 14. 9. News has reached Meshed that a Swedish officer is about to be appointed Chief of Police. 10. Eighty persons have joined the local branch of the Union and Progress Society (paragraph 8 last week), most of whom are Shrine officials. They have tumans 15,000 to retain his as second in authority. Zahir-ul-Islam has, after all, been allowed to leave for Tehran without settling his accounts. He has appoint- :V2 ■ Il l I I }' 4 l I' $ jiiffl!/ v f ;j ' 1 ! i i » ! 1 ! h; !j : -liwlLlin formed a Central Committee, and are apparently modelling themselves on the lines of the democrat bodies. 11 Persian affairs (gmemlf-The report of the relief of Khaf is confirmed. The rebels were compelled to evacuate the fort and have dispersed^ Their leader, H iii Muitaba, was wounded in the fight, and has been taken to Bakharz, where the Governor is keeping him pending his recovery. Khaf is now in possession of Abid Faiz Khan, who is representing Shahzadah Abdulla Mirza, the newly appointed Governor. 12. M. Kornelis has complained to the Revenue Minister : (1) that on account of the robber Khaddu’s activities and the fact that no serious steps have as yet been taken by anyone to deal with him it is impossible to collect the revenue due by certain villages in Kuchan district; and (2), that the Russian Bank proposes to take possession of the properties of the Rais-ut-Tujjar which step will, if allowed, prevent the realisation of revenue from such properties. \ 13. Lutfabad in the Daragez district was raided by a gang of robbers on the night of the tenth instant, who carried off some rifles and about 300 m cash without firing a shot. Five days later a similar party attacked the village of Dawanlu but the inhabitants assisted by Government sowars drove them off. One sowar was killed. The Governor of Daragez has telegraphed to the Governor-General reporting these incidents, which he ascribes to Turkoman instigation^ and example. He asks for a reinforcement of 100 Government sowars to assist m keeping order m the district. The Governor-General has sent a detailed telegram to the Home Secretary on the subiect of Daragez, expressing fear that the Turkomans may return to their old custom of raiding Khorassan, and asking for more imm and arms for the protection of the province. He suggests the payment to himself of tumans 10,000, for expenses. There seems to be, however, some genuine local anxiety on this subject. 14. There is no further news of the proposed return of Shirwan to the Governor of Kuchan. Probably the Chief of Bujnurd has arranged the matter by payment to the authorities (paragraph 8 of Diary No, 29). / 15. Protests. against the export of revenue again to Meshed from Kuchan and other places continue. If the Meshed proprietors could be compelled to sell tlieir stores at a reasonable price (paragraph 6 above), no question ot suck expor would arise. 16. Robbery and murder in broad daylight is reported this week from Baj- giran and Khelat. The state of the province is becoming worse daily. 17. The Governor of Sarakhs has telegraphed to the Home Secretary inform ing him that numbers of people have emigrate^ from Sarakhs on account oi loca scarcity (paragraph 12 last week). * 18. A party of Turshizis arrived in Meshed on the 7th instant. They have come to petition for the removal of their Governor, Sirdar Makhsus. 19. British affairs.—A party of 17 Barbari levies who were en route to Birjand from leave in Meshed who have been attacked and robbed at Robat-i-Kamai. Five of them seem to have disappeared, and the remainder have returned o Turbat-i-Haidari. The matter is being dealtwith. 20. Goods to the value of about three lakhs of rupees have been imported into Khorassan during the moflth of Sartan (22nd June to 22nd July), and there are many caravans actually on the roads, the arrival of which may shortly be expected. 21. Russian affairs. —The arrival of three Armenians, members of some revolu tionary society, is reported. It is believed that they intend to urge the Russian troops* here to act as others have recently done in Resht and other places. Some alarm exists, and the townspeople are preparing for eventualities. The Karguzar has telegraphed twice in cypher to the Foreign Minister suggesting that the Russian Legation should be requested to withdraw Russian troops irom Khorassan, or at least from Meshed, without delay. 22. It is reported from Sarakhs that the Russian frontier has been reopened.23. Aria ul-Mumalik, late Head Munshi of the Russian Consulate-General, has returned to his old post. 24. The house of Messrs. Nobel at Bagh-i-Katmi in which some officials of the Russian Bank are passing the summer was robbed on the night of the 16th instant, and considerable personal property was removed. 25. P ersian and German intrigues.—Dissensions among the democrats continue, and the moderate ” party are now in power. At present, the meetings seem to be entirely devoted to mutual recrimination varied by occasional bursts of temper accompanied by the production of firearms by the extreme section. 26. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—lt has been agreed to allow the export of 300 kharvars of private grain to Meshed within four months. 27. Two men, both named Ghulam Riza, coming from Herat (paragraph 31 of Lhary No. 30), have been arrested by the Russians and sent to Meshed. 28. The Khaf rebels (paragraph 11 above) have retired to Tanurah, a forti- ned hamlet m the neighbouring hills. . 29. Neivs from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Amjad-ul-Mulk, the Governor-General’s deputy to Jam in connection with the brothers Shaukat-ud-Daulah and Shaji-us- Sahanah, has returned and called upon me this morning (18th) before going to the Aik. He explained the temporary arrangement made between the two, which was that, pending a permanent settlement, Shaukat should govern East and Shaii West Jam, the portions being divided by the Jamrud river. Amjad said, however, that the two could not remain permanently in these positions, and that he intended to urge upon Kamran Mirza the desirability of appointing Shaukat elsewhere. 30. News from Herat.—The Turkoman Sirdar, Kurban Muhammad, has not yet received permission to leave Herat. 31. The purchase by the Naib Salar of more smuggled iron on the frontier is reported. 32. Twenty more Baluch families have come across the border and been sent to Chakhansur (paragraph 21 last week). It is said that these have been deported by the Russians. 33. The Naib Salar is constructing “flag” tents for some military purpose, and has obtained the measurements from Wagner. He takes every opportunity of acquiring military information from the German party. 34. Nasrullah was heard to say on the 5th instant that the way was now open for the servants of the German party to return to their homes as the Russian troops had been “ ejected ” from.Karez and other places. 35. Our Agent has sent an extract from some Persian paper said to be published in Russia which had been received by the Naib Salar. The article deals with a supposed pro-German peace party in England, headed by Lord Robert Cecil. Turkestan. Its contents are not yet known. 37. The Tehran newspaper “ Nau Bahar ” of the 24th July stated that the Turkish Consul in Tehran had been called to Constantinople. His name is given as “Abd-ur-Rahman Beg,” and it seems possible that this may be the Abd-ur-Rahman who was recently in Herat (paragraph 26 last week, etc.), especially as he was while there known as “ Consul.” Enquiries are being made. Furthel enquiries are being made, and the matter will be dealt with at length next week. 36. Kazim Beg is said to have received a letter from Mahendra Pertab from Meshed : W. G.

(1) News reached the Indian Officer Commanding at Bandan on the 22nd instant that two Germans and four Afghans had crossed the border and reached the neighbourhood of Chah Saput. Parties of Cavalry and Camel Levies were sent out but discovered no strangers. It seems that the news was originally elicited from a Persian who is or feigns to be a simpleton. He was caught sound ing the depth of a well, and then stated that he had come from Herat with German party which was close behind him. The man is being sent into Sistan for inspection. (2) The belief seems to be growing in Sistan that the Germans have come or will come to Kerman. It is said that Sistanis who have gone there are now experiencing difficulties at the hands of some authority (identity not known) about returning. News from Afghanistan. (1) An Afghan caravan has arrived in Sistan from Farah bringing loaf sugar and soft sugar, originally obtained from India. The men say that they have heard that seven or eight Germans recently reached Herat from Russia, and that affairs on the Russian frontier seem to be in a normal state, trains regularly arriving there. (2) The Afghans have at last, after six weeks, allowed Helmand water to come our side, and it flowed into Sistan to-day (25th August). News from Birjand. (1) His Majesty’s Vice-Consul has received some information about two robberies which occurred in the early part of the month on the main road south of Turbat-i-Haidari. (а) On the 3rd August, mounted robbers attacked the mail, coming from Meshed to Sistan, near Faizabad. They opened the Sistan bag but did not carry off the contents. The Birjand bag with parcels was carried off. A parcel containing Russian notes, value 20,000 Roubles, bought in Meshed for Labh Singh of Sistan, was fortunately left by the robbers, who were told by the driver that it contained postal receipts ! (б) On the 9th August, a party of unarmed Hazara Levies returning from leave were attacked by 16 robbers, who were on foot, near Mianeh. A mounted Hazara galloped back to Mianeh and asked for assistance from the Cossack post there. This was unfortunately refused, and a Persian post at Amrani also afterwards refused to move. The Hazaras’ kit and transport were all carried off. Lieutenant Brenan thinks that the Amnieh sowars under the Turbat Govern ment are concerned in these outrages. (2) Monsieur Boulatoff informed Lieutenant Brenan on the 23rd instant that he had been informed by Tashkent that Amir Habibullah Khan had been deposed and that Nasrullah Khan had been enthroned. We have told him that there seems to be no truth in the story.•nwr South Persia Rifles. See last week’s diary. I hear from Dehaneh Baghi that Setgeant Cox and his cars have safely reached Fahreh this afternoon (25th August). Cholera in Meshed. On the 19th instant I heard by telegraph that cholera had broken out in Meshed. The Governor of this Province was promptly informed through His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Birjand. A quarantine camp has been established at Mehemm Godari Sulaiman where caravans and travellers will be detained five days His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk has reported his action to the Minister of the Interior, the Governor-General of Khorasan and neighbouring Governors.

M) Press, Simla.—No. C.360 F.D.—10-9'17—29-'M.D,'uij Intelligence Summary No. 29 for the week ending the 21st July 1917. Khorasan and N. E. Persia. 357. Gurgan force. —The passage through Kizil Arvat of an independent squadron, employed against the Yomud Turkoman, towards Turkistan is reported. 358. Persian Cossack Brigade. —There has been less excitement during the week on the matter of the Persian Cossacks, although a deputation of some hundreds waited on the Governor-General to ascertain if he had received an answer from Tehran on the subject. Colonel Mamomov informed me that matters were somewhat improved. M. Nikolsky looks on the matter as without much importance, and due chiefly to the opportunities afforded by Ramadan for meetings and discussion. It is true that he has^neither personally suffered from the boycott or other annoyances, nor has he been the recipient of threatening letters. Those more immediately concerned cannot, perhaps, be expected to view the affair in quite so detached or philosophical a light. 359. Emigrants. —An arrival from Kalandarabad in the Jam rayon reports the passage towards Bakharz of some 20 mounted Turkomans. They arrived with Baluchi guides whom they exchanged for Barbaris. They were apparently in a hurry, and paid tomans ten per guide without discussion. The Russians have been informed. Herat and Afghanistan. 360. Germans and adherents. —Two more mules have been sold by the German party. They explain their action by the uselessness of spending money on the upkeep of expensive transport when, very shortly, on the conclusion of peace by the Russians they will be enabled to obtain Government transport to the Russian frontier whence they can take the train home. The Naib Salar appears to share their opinion ; the Naib-ul-Hukumah is more sceptical. The Russian offensive may be expected to cause some disappointment. In consequence of the reduction, a groom Ghulam Hussain Yazdi (No. 10 on list furnished by Ahmad Barbari attached to Intelligence Summary No. 6 of 1917) has received permission to proceed to his country. Additional descrip tive particulars are: thin, nose somewhat crooked, small moustache sprouting. Wagner threatened to imprison another follower—Muhammad Arab— “ for life.” On representation that this action would have a discouraging effect on other servants he pardoned him. 361. Dahna-i-Zulfiqar .—Reference paragraph 339. 20 Barbaris arrived at the post to take over the duty of 20 khasadars who left for Herat. At pre sent a disposition appears to exist to distribute Barbaris in Afghan service as tar as possible on frontier posts. The agent responsible for the report of the storage of grain is again in that neighbourhood, and states that there is no doubt that some 600 camel-loads were brought there ; at present he can ascertain no special reason. Three rooms, usually occupied by the garrison, were vacated to provide additional storage. The camelmen are now conveying grain to Gulran post. 1 hear from other sources that about the same quantity was provided last year but that, from want of accommodation, about half of it was stored at JNihal Shani post. 362. Mazar-i-Sharif .—A report dated the 4th instant states that nothing of importance had occurred during the previous month, with the exception of the receipt of 100 magazine rifles from Kabul.2 .&gt; * 'W Russian Turkistan. 363. Current affairs. —In expectation of the resignation of M. Stchepkin from the Turkistan Committee, the Russian Musulman Council favours the candidature for President of Chaikin, a socialist and editor of the “ Turkistan Golos The order for the introduction of town constitutions in Turkistan was pub lished on the 1 ith instant. As regards supplies, considerable dismay has been caused by the announce ment that \ million puds of grain, still due from Russia for the month of May, will not be furnished. Arrangements for the distribution of this amount through, out Turkistan had already been made, and energetic protests are being entered against its withdrawal. Some excitement was caused at Askhabad by the reduction on the 13th instant of the bread allowance to f lb. per person. 364. Military affairs. —The Ministry of War has replied to the Turkistan Committee that the draft system cannot be continued in Turkistan, and that the regiments must be despatched as ordered. Tne first Siberian Rifle Reserve Regiment left Tashkend in 3 echelons between the 10th and 13th instant, the last echelon being accompanied by a draft of Ukranians. The 2nd S. R. R. Regiment was to leave a few days later. An officer just returned from Askha bad states that the 5 th and 8th S. R. R. Regiments had not left that place a few days ago, but were apparently waiting for relief. As far as the Staff here have information, Siberian Rifle Reserve Regiments in Turkistan numbered eight, each regiment consisting of 2 battalions. Two of them were at Samarkand but there is no information as yet regard ing their departure. 365. -A detailed petition against Colonel Khan Yomudski was addressed to the Turkistan Committee by Merv representative Turkomans in which he was blamed for the dissensions retarding the settlement of Turkoman affairs. Khan Yomudski subsequently left, it is understood, for the Caucasus front whence he was originally summoned on special duty by General Kuropatkin. The Government mail on the Tejen-Sarakhs road has been looted, and robberies are rife in the Sarakhs vicinity. Thefts of railway iron continue. A hut was broken into at the 139th verst and iron stolen ; and a watchman at the 274th verst discovered a small caravan of 8 camels loaded with railway iron, but was warned off by the Turkoman drivers who were armed with rifles. 366. Semirechia .—Fervent appeals, signed by representative Kirghiz, appear in the Turkistan News for assistance and protection of Kirghiz life and property. It is stated that in the Prjevalsk district Russian peasants and returned soldiers, the latter being the worst offenders, are plundering and killing the unfortunate Kirghiz wffio had fled to Chinese territory last year, and who have the permission of the authorities to return to their land. 240 are said to have been massacred in this fashion about the 20th May, and another 40 about a fortnight later. In the Djarkent district the Kirghiz are reported to be dying of starvation, selling their women and children, and in some cases even killing the latter. Making all allowance for exaggerations it is obvious that much distress and animosity prevails. In the light of last year’s events little else could have been expected. E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.* Colonel&gt; G.S.O.r~ &amp;*** It would probably be correct to add to above for the Anardarrah section, squadron of cavalry and at least i flag of kkavanin. In spite of the fact that khasadars as such are supposed to be abolished the infantry on the frontier are still referred to as, and in point of fact probably still are, khasadars, 3. Up till the report of June, the normal post garrison was given as 7 regular cavalry and 10 khavanin.^ On noting the increase of 10 khavanin I in quired whether the figure 10 as given formerly, or the 20 of the last report was correct; and was informed the latter as the Naib-ul-Hukumat had recently given orders to increase post strengths. The Russians have also heard independently of this increase. A full report of posts dated the 22nd March last gives the following totals on frontier duty:— March iqij*— Regular cavalry... Khavanin ... Khasadars ... ... 4. Combining previous reports, including that of the Russian Frontier Guard of last September sent you on the 17th November last, posts given total 54 as against 35 in the present report. Many of the places could not' be identified in any map. The list was sent to Herat for check and reply received that the June report embodied all posts at present held (N.B. Except in all probability some to S. of Ghorian). In addition it was stated that the following places noted in the Russian report had had a few sowars quartered in Jthem temporarily.

Presumably these reports all refer to the same individual for whose interception such arrangements have been made as the vagueness of the intelligence permits. Reference also paragraph 313. 1? j 0, Dahna-i-Zulfiqar .—From the report of an individual specially des- patched to enquire into the grain question at that post it would appear that the amount of gram reported to have been collected there has been considerably exaggerated. As, however, most contradictory reports have been received the matter will be watched. The strength of the post is reported at 50 Khavanin and 50 Knasadars / . Russian Turkistan. u 37 i I; Cu7 ' rent —Various candidates are rumoured for the post of M.. otchepkin, whose resignation seems to be considered certain. The Pan-Russian Musulman Council is concerned with affairs in Khiva, for reforms in which state they are about to appoint a Commission. The Merv Tokhtamysh Turkoman have already paid up in full the hut tax due from them for the current year. The Turkoman in the neighbourhood of It u -J 1 ,Sarakhs continue to act with absolute license. They carry arms with complete impunity and hang them up openly in front on their dwellings. 30 infantrymen have now been sent to Sarakhs and constitute the only force at that point. ,72 Military .—The 5th Siberian Rifle Reserve Regiment has left Askha- Karl for the front The Committee of the 8th S. R. R. R. has passed a resolution for the retirement of their commander, Colonel Gabaev This is presumably the officer who commanded the first detachment detailed for the punishment of the 'X/ r\ rv* 11 Turkoman. 250 women at Tashkent have volunteered for the women’s “ Death Bat- talion.” ,77 Bokhara. —An intelligent Persian merchant resident at Bokhara gives the fol owing account of the disturbances there last Apr.l, and subsequent events. (Reference paragraphs 225, 238, 25. and 343 -) g' f* 16 P, ubl “\ of the k ™\ s manifesto the young-Bokharans .obtained the Resident s (Miller) consent to their attending the Amir with congratulaiions. Some 300 m number, and oined ro'ite by about roo Persian sympathisers they were approach,ng the nalace when intelligence reached them that the Mullahs armed and numbering several thousand, had assembled to attack them. They therefore dispersed but subsequently several of their leaders were arrested by the Khush Begi, taken to the Ark, and most severely flogged. They were then imprisoned in the Ark. Certain of the partv, however, reached Kaghan whence they despatched a tele- sram to M. Miliukhov at Petrograd, and another to Tashkent asking for protec tion Thereplvto this message placed the responsibi.ity of any loss of lite on the Amir and his advisers, and in consequence a detachment of Cossacks was K'aahan hv the Resident to bring the prisoners to the Residency. While waiting outside the Aik, one of the Cossacks horses was shot by a mullah and a Cossack was wounded on the head by a stone. Without engaging the crowd the Cossacks escorted the prisoners to Kaghan where one oi them, a respectable merchant named Mirza Nasrullah, succumbed to his injuries. 500 Russian troops with 2 machine guns were sent to Bokhara where they remained for some weeks, after which they were withdrawn, 100 men only still being retained at Kaghan. Some time subsequently, by a curious chance, a letter written by Miller (or one of his staff) on the occasion of the demonstration to the Qazi Qalan, the executive head of the mullahs, came to light. The Qazi was enjoined to await the arrival of the young-Bokharans at the Ark where they were to be seized, and (it is said) executed, Miller taking all responsibility. ^ The letter was taken to the Ka CT han Executive Committee wno apparently implicitly accepted its authenti city! and arrested Miller, despatching him to Russia. The Khush Begi and Qazi Qalan were dismissed and their posts have now been filled by adherents to the young-Bokharan party. The Amir is said to have asked the Russian delegates, subsequently sent to Bokhara in connection with reforms, for time to introduce them without arousing the active opposition of the mullahs. The Amir is apparently in a difficult position as the mullahs are all powerful, particularly in the out-districts where the people are, in ignorance of their real interests, absolutely under the mullahs’ thumb. Outside Bokhara itself the lives of adherents to the young-Bokharan party are unsafe, and two respectable citizens, suspected of adhering to it, were recently hauled out of the train at Guzar and with difficulty escaped with their lives. The vested pecuniary interests of the mullahs are very large, and they are aware that these would be more than compromised by the introduction of liberal reforms Young Bokha rans belonging to all classes of the population of which they are the most enlightened element. Owing to the want of rain, and the failure of water for irrigation in the Zarafshan* 3 the harvest has proved a failure, and the people are in great straitb&gt; for grain. ’ Their condition is, however, better than that of the inhabitants ofTurkistan. There is practically famine in Ferghana,—at Andijan, Khokand, etc., and great scarcity among the native population at Tashkent. In a recent stay °f 5 days at Tashkent my informant was only once able to obtain bread. Although officially f lb. per diem can be obtained on a bread ticket it involves waiting for most of the day. My informant was of opinion that if peace be delayed for more than a few months longer serious disorders must inevitably arise both in Turkistan and Bokhara on the ground of scarcity of provisions and all necessary commodities. He did not think these would have—primarily at any rate—any political signifi cance. He had heard rumours of German provocative agents in Bokhara, but had no personal knowledge of any such action. Troubles would, in all probabi lity, commence in Ferghana, where distress is more acute. The Russians in Turkistan are very nervous of hostile Afghan action, but as far as his knowledge extended, quite without cause. Incidentally he mentioned conversations he had had on railway journeys, since the revolution, with Russian soldiers in which the latter expressed their hopes of the speedy conclusion of a separate peace. They blamed the British for all their misfortunes and hoped to be able to join the Germans in opera tions against India and elsewhere. Before the revolution such opinions were never heard. This is by no means the first time I have heard of the expression of such opinions of which the excellent Saratov militia, among others, were exponents. Discount as one may the opinions of ignorant men, their free expression, among an oriental population in particular, is not calculated to enhance the native con ception of the loyalty and durability of the Anglo-Russian alliance.

'Persian officials. —Shahzada Hashim Mirza, the recently appointed head of the Bequests office, arrived on the 14th instant. He is a democrat of the moderate order, and we do not expect trouble from him. 2. Munshi Nizam (paragraph 11 last week) gives out that he does not desire the appointment of Chief of Police, but that if the people wish for him he will accept it. Meanwhile M. Nicolsky and I have arranged with the Governor-’&amp;eneral that he should not be appointed/ 3. A movement is on foot for Nusrat-ul-Mulk to be posted as Governor of Sarakhs, where complaints against the present Governor are general. 4. Our Karguzar is still trying for election to the new National Assembly, and with this object in view is dealing leniently with his countrymen (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 22.) 5. Notwithstanding all our efforts to secure adequate punishment for the murderers of the late Musaddik-ud-Daulah, Chief of Police, the only persons punish ed have been the two abettors of the crime who have been deported (paragraph 7 of Diary No. 23); the actual criminals are, in the opinion of the Governor-General, too strong and influential for him to deal with them $,s they deserve. M. Nicolsky does not feel able fo do more than give him good advice on the subject, which he ignores. 6. Persian affairs {local). —There has been no further disturbance during the past week in connection with the protest against the Persian Cossack Brigade (paragraph 3 last week). The Karguzar visited M. Nicolsky and explained the situation to him. He said that it was quite untrue that there was any pro- i German element in this opposition: that the revolution in Russia had been fatal to 1 German interests in this country as the Persians now look to Russian democracy i as the best guarantee for the independence of their country : that the people of r Meshed had been opposed to the Persian Cossack Brigade from its inception owing to its supposed connection with the “ Control of the Finances ” question : and that the recent bad behaviour of certain Persian officers of the Brigade had brought matters to a crisis. He strongly recomuiended the dismissal of Husain Kuli, a well know interiguer who was until recently in charge of the local Maliyah soivars. I had already urged this upon my colleague, but Husain Kuli has always been friendly with him, and he is disinclined to believe in his misconduct. Mean while no reply has come to the Governor-General’s reference to Tehran, and the telegraph office is visited from time to time by parties of malcontents who are telegraphing to the Shah and the Home Office urging the disbandment of the Brigade owing to the oppression which the general public are receiving at their hands. 7. The despatch of a certain amount of revenue grain from Turbat-i-Haidari district to Meshed has somewhat relieved the acuteness of the position here on the subject of grain and bread prices, but the relief is only temporary. 8. Persian affairs {general). —The Home Secretary has telegraphed to the Chief of Bujnurd giving him 14 days in which to arrest the robber Rhuddu (para graph 6 last week), failing which Shirwan is to be retransferred to the Government of Kuchan. It is said that heavy bribery on the part of Shuja-ud-Daulah has brought about this decision, 9. The Gunabad affair (paragraph 7 last week) has terminated in the sub mission of the refractory Deputy-Governor and the payment of the post robbery compensation by him. He is to be called to Meshed. 10. One Mir Yusuf, who was formerly an outlaw and highwayman in the Khaf district, has been pardoned by the local Governor and appointed chief of his sowars. This is a good instance of the common Persian method of dealing with such criminals.' If I ffii i ,;i r 1 i ' V '&gt;■ i i ■im ,, « mo 9 000 families of Barbaries have emigrated to Afghanistan from their\iomra^ear TMrbat-i-Shaiklx 3am and Pas-i-Kuh on account o local scare,y. 12.

Robberies by Baluch in the neighbourhood continue. 22. Neivs from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—The brothers, Shaukat-ud-Daidah (who is still at Jam), and Shaji-us : Saltanah, appear to be on good terms. The former shews no signs of interfering in his brother s rights as Governor, which is all we require of him. The llbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Suitan are also quiet. 1 trust that this is not the calm before the storm. An official has arrived to watch matters on behalf of the Governor-General, as suggested to him by us. 23. News from Herat.—BaAnch emigration into Afghanistan from Russian territory on account of famine continues : the arrival of 90 more families is reported. This party has been sent to Chakhansur with orders to the local Governor not to allow any of them to leave the country without a Government pass. 24. The merchants interested have prevailed upon the Naib-ul-Hukumah to rescind his order regarding the export of their sugar (paragraph 22 last week). In consequence the price has risen from krans 16 to krayis 22 per man. 25. The arrival of some relatives of the Turkoman Sirdar Kurban Muhammad is reported. Permission for his return to Russian Turkistan has not yet been granted, however, (paragraph 25 of Diary No. 24). 26. Wagner has undertaken to instruct the son of an employe of the Naib-nl- Hukumah in field sketching. 27. Bayerl sold four mules on the 8th July for tumans 220. The servants of the German party have agaibeen asked why they were selling their animals. They gave two reasons in reply ', one that money was required, and the other that Russia is about to make peace with Germany, when the party will travel, with Afghan Government transport, to Shaikh Junaid and thence to their homes by rail. 28. One Ghulam Husain Yezdi, z syce who accompanied the German party from Kabul to Herat, has obtained permission from Wagner to leave for his country, and Wagner also made a general offer to let any of his servants go who washed No other seems to have responded to this, but Ghulam Husam is saic to be leaving at once. We have his description and it has been communicated to Sistan, etc. - 29. Orders have arrived from the Naib-us-Saltanah at Kabul that the escaped Turkish prisoner (paragraph 22 of Diary No. 25) is to be sent thither. Kazim Beg did his best to have these orders ignored, saying that the man was old and weak, etc., but the Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered him to be prepared to leave at the end of Ramzan. 30. The Naib Solar is said to have informed Kazim Beg on the 12th instant that Russia had made a separate peace. Wagner on hearing this enquired from the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who replied that it was not yet certain. (N.B. —The news of fresh Russian offensive should have reached Herat by this time.) 31. Maulvi Barkat-ullah is still indisposed and confined to bis quarters. 32 Saiyid Hussain has reached Herat, and gave our salutations (but aparently not our letter) to Haji Ghulam Husain. The latter told him on no account to let the German party know that he was on good terms with us. 33. Abd-ur-Rahman (paragraph 26 last week) appears to have gone straight to Tehran or elsewffiere without coming to Meshed. Enquiry is still proceeding in the matter of the cheque paid to the German party (paragraph 36 of Diary No. 27). Meshed : •&gt; W. G.

Persian officials. —Shahzadah Murtaza Mirza has telegraphed to Tehran protesting against the proposal of the Revenue Department to annul his lease of the Nawakal or animal tax for the purpose of letting it to a higher bidder. 2. Protests have been sent to Tehran against the proposed dismissal of the revenue officer at Turbat-i-Haidari, who is popular among the local people. 3. Muazziz-ul-Mulk has been appointed head of the Karai troops at Turbat-i- Haidari. 4. Farjullah Khan has replaced Sherullah Khan as Deputy Governor of Shirwan under the Chief of Bujnurd. 5. Persian affairs (local). —No reply has yet come from Tehran to the protest against the formation of a local force of Persian Cossacks under Russian officers (paragraph 6 last week), but on the 22nd instant a long telegram was sent to His Majesty the Shah through Mustaufi-ul-Mumalik by a representative body of no less than 91 persons, asking for a reply and again urging their objections. The applicants add that the force not only is desired by no person imKhorassan but that its creation will be more harmful than beneficial to the Persian Government as it will merely tend to increase the nation’s debt to Russia. 6. The grain question came to a head on the forenoon of Sunday, the 22nd instant, when a mob raided the shop of a baker in the street known as the Bala Khiaban. The Governor-General despatched to the scene a force of sarbazes who dispersed the rioters and arrested two of the ringleaders. His Excellency at the same time dismissed the man whom he had appointed to supervise the bakeries. He then sent an urgent message to M. Kornelis requesting his presence at the Ark, and at jbhe interview which followed M. Kornelis induced him to place the Revenue Assistant, Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah, in charge of the grain and bread questions. For two or Three days after this matters shewed some improvement, but the Ma’tamid, who is working on right lines, requires more powers to deal with the private grain-owners than he at present possesses, and he has asked M. Nicolsky and myself to telegraph to our Legations in support of a recommenda tion already made to Tehran by the Governor-General on the subject, Action will probably be taken accordingly. The Ma’tamid desires to arrange that an equal number of kharwars of wheat be purchased daily by breadmakers at tumans 20 from the Maliyah and 'tumans 27 from the private owners. This will admit of the sale of bread at krans 2 per man, but to carry out the scheme some pressure will have to be put upon the private owners, who must supply 20,000 klnarwars at lea-st. Two thousand kharwars of revenue wheat are to be sent to Meshed from Kuchan shortly ; and fresh orders have been issued from Tehran forbidding all export of grain from Persia until further orders. 7. A further reference has been made to Tehran regarding the pay of local officials, the first having elicited no reply (paragraph 1 of Diary No. 27). 8. The Foreign Secretary has telegraphed to the Karguzar directing him to submit a report upon secret meetings held in Meshed and the people who attend them, and also upon the annonymous letters and threatening messages which have recently been delivered. 9. By the same authority the Karguzar is remindeo that he has not yet sent in his report upon the casualties and losses suffered by the people of Khorassan at the hands of the Russians (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 13); and he is told at the same time that Khorassan is the only province from which the report on this subject has not been received. j. \ ? •} 1 ifi10. Persian affairs ((/ewera?).—Grain riots are reported from Kuchan and Khelat. Each, however, ceased with the issue of revenue grain by the orders of the local Governor. 11. Energetic action by Karasuran at Sarakhs recently killed two of a trouble some robber band and recovered some stolen property. 12. British affairs. —A sum of tumans 2,000 has been paid to the Imperial Bank by Shuja-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, in further liquidation of his debt to them. This is part of the first of two instalments which fall due next month (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 7). 13. Russian affairs. —One Agha Jalil, a Russian subject, has been detected in smuggling wheat to Russia in tea-boxes. 14. Further misconduct by Russian subjects on the Sarakhs frontier is reported, and the Russian local authorities have given permission for the miscreants to be pursued by Persian sowars across the border in the event of a robbery being committed in Persian territory. 15. My colleague is displeased with Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan (paragraph 12 above), on the ground that he does nothing to forward Russian interests. 16’. Persian and German intrigues. —The return to Meshed is announced of Shahzadah Abdullah Mirza, Saham-ul-Ayalah, a late Commissary of Police, who was deported to Tehran a year or so ago. We do not expect any trouble from him. 17. It seems that at a secret meeting of democrats held during the week it was decided that a certain person, whose name was not disclosed during the proceed ings, should be put to death by the society of “ Terrorists ” recently organised (paragraph 17 of Diary No. 20), and lots were drawn to appoint the executioner. The lot fell upon one Jabbar, a Russian subject, and he is to receive his instructions when the condemned man returns to the city, from which he is now absent. At the same meeting letters from Malik-ush-Shura’, editor of the Nau Bahar of Tehran, and branch democrat committees at various places in Khorassan, were read. They contained nothing of interest beyond exhortation to energy and fidelity, and congratulation on recent changes in the Persian Government. 18. News from Turhat-i-Haidari. —The Governor has been ordered by the Governor-General to send 1,000 kharwars of wheat to Meshed or resign his post. His position is thus rendered difficult, as there is much local feeling against any grain leaving the place. Meanwhile bread is selling at 2j krans per man and efforts are being made to reduce it to 2|. 19. Nothing is being done in regard to the Baluch robbers in this neighbour hood, and they have killed and plundered one Haji Ismail at Mazra’ Ali, three farsakhs from Turbat. 20.. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh-Jam.. —The murder of two Heratis near Eariman is reported. The thieves took from the corpses tumans 1,500. Mir Baki Sultan is suspected of complicity in this crime, but the murderers have not yet been traced. 21. The Russian military detachment left Jam on July 16th. 22. News from Herat. —The robbery of tumans 200 from a Jew near Robat-i- Surkh is reported. The Naib-ul Hukumah has ordered the amount to be recovered from local guards, etc. 23. It is ordered that Puri Khan and one of the Austrian escaped prisoners will accompany the Turk to. Kabul (paragraph 29 last week). An attempt by Wagner to retain the Austrian at Herat has not been successful.. 24. Nasrullah gave out in a shop in the bazar on the 14th July that Russia has made peace and that Britain wished to follow her example but that Germany would not consent, being determined to destroy British power. Those present, however, said that these reports were false, and nothing was gained by Nasrullah,■- 25. Kazim Beg met with an accident while out riding on the 17th instant and is under medical treatment. 26. On the same day the Naib-ui-Hukumah, while in company with our Agent, was asked whether it were true that the Turks had retaken Baghdad. He replied that news to that effect had come from Meshed, but that he did not know how true !t was The questioner then enquired why the Powers were fighting, and the A aib said that the war was caused by the large recent increase in the population of Germany, which it made necessary for her to extend her frontiers. Our Agent : : here put in that the Germans had before the war large territory in Africa which they imght have populated, and suggested that they desired world domination. The Aaib agreed with this latter explanation. 27 A Khawanin soivar has incurred the displeasure of the Naib-ul-Hukumah tor exchanging horses with Bayerl. i 2 ?'j Wagner vlslted the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 19th, but beyond that Baghdad was mentioned their conversation is not known. ii 29 i ^ bd - ur - Rallman (paragraph 33 last week) is now said to have told a book seller of Herat that he was going to Isfahan. His Majesty’s Consul-General there ' has been informed, and such description as we have of this man has been sent to No. 27) had no connection with the cheque sent to Herat for the German party. It w T as no doubt sent by the Amir’s commercial Agent here. y iT/? i hear fr ° m var ! ous sources that a Herat merchant named Riza, alias Gul Muhammad, is leaving Herat on a mission for the German party to Bandar Gaz via Turbat-i-Haidari, Meshed, Kuchan. We have not been able to obtain a description of this man, but such steps as are possible will be taken in regard to him. It is also said that Ghulam Riza (paragraph 30 of Diary No. 23) will come shortly to Meshed. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, him. 30 Enquiry shows that Haji Muhammad Husain (paragraph 36 of Diary '*y 7 I Q / l VI C\ VI /■'¥/'&gt; 4' 1 /''V TT T1 4- H -1- ^ _ J 1 'FT' I C it ' His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. , o.

Persian officials. —Renewed efforts are being made by prominent and influential persons, such as the recently arrived Hashim Mirza, for the return of Naiyur-ud-Daulah as Governor-General, and there are persistent rumoufs that he will shortly be appointed. We would welcome the change, which would undoubt edly be for the good of the country. 2. It is said that the newly appointed Pishkar of the Governor-General, Mushawar-ul-Mumalik, who has already left Tehran, is bringing with him one Husain Kuli for the post of Rais-i-Nazmiah. We know nothing of this person, but M. Nicolsky has protested against the appointment on the ground that he is a pro-German. Telegrams have been sent to Tehran refusing to accept him. 3. Zahir-ul-Islam, the Mutwali Bashi, is dismissed from office and Murtaza Kuli Khan, now Governor of Sabzawar, is appointed in his place. Hashmat- us-Sultan, a son of the late Rukn-ud-Daulah, is mentioned as likely to succeed Murtaza at Sabzawar, 4. Shazadah Amir Akram, son of Kamran Mirza, is appointed Governor of Tun and Tabas, the present incumbent being dismissed. 5. Persian affairs (local).—On account of scarcity of water all owners of gardens in the vicinity of Meshed and Kuchan have petitioned Tehran through the Governor-General for a reduction in the amount of revenue claimed from them for the current year. 6. Nothing more has happened in connection with the protests against the Persian Cossack Brigade (paragraph 5 last week) beyond the receipt by the Karguzar of a telegram from the Foreign Office asking for the exact facts regarding the alleged misbehaviour of the Cossacks. The Karguzar has sent a wise reply, detailing not only certain acts of misconduct but describing the steps taken by Colonel Mamanoff and his officers to prevent their recurrence. 7. Robbery in the neighbourhood of the city by certain sowars of the garrison is reported. They have not yet been paid, and are getting out of hand in con sequence (paragraph 7 last week). 8. The bread question continues to be one of grave difficulty. I have had some long discussions with M. Kornelis on the subject during the past week. There appears to be nothing better than to obtain the powers for Ma’tamid- ul-Wizarah (paragraph 6 last week), and try to supervise his subsequent con duct of affairs. Meanwhile M. Kornelis is in despair owing to the Governors of Turbat-i-Haidari and Kuchan not having yet sent in the full amount of revenue grain demanded of them. M. Nicolsky and I have asked for the support of our Legations to the proposal to grant powers to Ma’tamid-ul-Wizarah. 9. A revival of the local branch of the “ Union and Progress ” society is urged from Tehran, but it is doubtful whether they would do much here on account of the number and strength of the democrat bodies. 10. Persian affairs (general). —It seems that' the pardoned Deputy Gov ernor of Gunabad has, after all, no intention of paying the post robbery indem nity (paragraph 9 of Diary No. 29). He also refuses to come to Meshed. 11. A large and representative body of Turshizis have telegraphed to the Home Office protesting against the inability of their Governor, Sirdar Makhsus, to keep the district in order. 12. The Chief of Bujnurd has suggested to Tehran that steps should now be taken to recover the Persian rifles and ammunition which were taken recently from the Yamut and Goklan Turkomans by the Russian punitive force. He adds that as the Russian troops are about to be withdrawn from the neighbourhood±s=ssi Hm; 1 M a &lt; Ilk/' • UH Ij # ' ♦ ■ I f i i - ^ ! i M. ' \ , I i « the Persian Government should now consolidate its authority by the appointment of a strong and capable Governor to control these unruly peoples. 13. A dispute over the possession of land has taken place at Kasimabad in Shirwan between some of the Rais-ut-Tujjar’s men and one Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, a protege of Haji Husain Agha. The latter, who was deported from Meshed by Naiyur-ud-Daulah for persistent intriguing, has some connection, direct or indirect, with nearly every disturbance in the province. 14. Serious disturbances are reported from Khaf. The Governor was direct ed to send one of his servants, Haji Mujtaba, to Turbat-i-Haidari under escort, and the latter made his escape at night with two horses and six rifles with ammunition, the property of his master. Mir Yusuf (paragraph 10 of Diary No. 29) with 15 men joined him and having proceeded to the village of Salami they raided the house of Haji Agha Muhammad, the Imperial Bank’s Agent at Turbat, taking a rifle, a horse, clothes, carpets, etc. Thence they went to Rushkar and seized a number of camels near the village. Here a further party of ruffians joined them including the Revenue assistant at Rushkar, and having fought an indecisive action with a force of local sowars and villagers, they raided a Taimuri encamp ment, carrying off camels and sheep. Meanwhile the Governor of Khaf tele graphed to Meshed for orders ; and, after waiting for five days for a reply, which did not come, telegraphed to Tehran eulogising his former services to the State ; complaining of the Governor-General of Khorasan for ignoring his request; and asking for leave to act in direct communication with the Home Office. Before the arrival of any reply to this interesting reference Haji Mujtaba suddenly returned to Khaf and entered the Ark with 50 men. The Governor then took sanctuary in the telegraph office with the Russian telegraphist, and the latter is now, according to the latest reports, “ negotiating with the Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari with a view to arrange a reconciliation ” presumably between the Governor and his rebellious servant. Mir Yusuf is said to have returned to his stronghold in the hills with a quantity of wheat, having profited largely from his brief pose as a respectable individual. 15. The appearance of a body of Russian Turkomans in the vicinity ofZorabad is reported. They are already responsible for several robberies with murder. 16. British affairs. —Another thousand tumans have been received by the Imperial Bank from Shuja-ud-Daulah (paragraph 12, last week), and we hear that he fully intends to pay 4,500 more this month, making up the instalment of 7,500 which falls due on the 25th instant. 17. Russian affairs. —The Russian frontiers being closed for a time, our Passport Officer has been directed to issue no passport to Russia from 26th July to 15th August. i 18. M. Nicolsky informs me that he receives continual requests for grain from various places in Turkestan to which he [is unable to respond. Meanwhile we hear that the price of wheat at Askabad is about half the Meshed price! 19. Two Bulgarian escaped prisoners have been arrested in the precincts of the Shrine during the week, and made over to the Russians. 20. Trouble between Turkomans and Persians is reported from the Daragez and Khelat frontiers. It seems that in each locality water from the rivers is scarce and the Turkomans demand the share which would fall to them in normal years. 21/ The Karguzar has received a secret telegram from the Foreign Office informing him that the Revenue Department at Meshed complain' of the non payment of revenue by Russian subjects on land, etc., owned or leased by them. He is directed first to arrange for the payment of such revenue, and then to submit a list of all landed property, including shops, in the possession, permanent or tem porary, of Russian subjects, with a description of the property and particulars regarding the period of lease or terms of acquisition. 22. Persian and German intrigues .—Saham-ul-Ayalah (paragraph 16, last week) has rejected overtures made to -him by the local democrats, saying that they allowed him to be deported last year and that nqw he intends to “ work for the British and Russians.” He has been given a post in the Excise Department.23. There are said to be no less than 96 branches of the democrat committee in Meshed which consist of from 12 to 14 members each. At a secret meeting of the central and chief branch held during the week it was decided that every new member joining the society should be required to provide a rifle and revolver for his own use. It was said that the society had purchased 54 rifles in Tehran and were keeping them secretly here for sale to new members. The people who import these weapons are known to our agent, and one of them—a woman—is being housed by him in order that her movements may be watched and reported. We hope to act in this matter when necessary. 24. News from Turbat-i-Haidari--T)i$contziit continues regard ing the pro posed export of local revenue grain to Meshed. Two hundred kharwars have already been despatched. 25. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam .—Eelations are now strained between the brothers Shaji-us-Saltanah and Shaukat-ud-Daulah. Late reports shew that the latter, supported by Mir Baki Sultan, has taken possession of the fort of Jam and Shaji has had to retire to his private residence at Mahmudabad. The Governor-General has at length sent a deputation to bring both brothers to Meshed. For all this trouble and annoyance we are indebted to a combination of the intrigues of Haji Husain Agha (paragraph 12 above) and the impotence of Kamtan Mirza. 26. News from Hera^.—The usual congratulatory visits were paid to the Naib- ul-Hukumah on th^ 21st July, the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr. Wagner does not appear to have attended in person, but to have sent a present of cakes. 27. The Naib-us-Saltanah has ordered that all elderly men among the Khawa- nin sowars should be replaced by youths, and instructions to this effect have been issued to troop leaders. 28. Our Agent met the Kotwal recently (who is an uncle of the Mehmandar of the German party at Bagh-i-Kertah) and asked himior news of Abd-ur-Bahman (paragraph 20, last week). The Kotwal, after some prevarication, said that he had reached Meshed safely and was probably now on his way to Tehran : this he knew from a letter which Abd-ur-Kahman’s guide had brought back. He refrained from giving any further information beyond that Abd-ur-Rahman’s mission was of importance. Our Agent thinks that this man must have brought a communica tion from Turkey for the Afghan Government, and that he has now gone with the reply. The identity^of the guide mentioned has not been established. 29. Kazim Beg visited the Naib Salar on the 2nd July and told him that the British had forced the King of Greece to make war on Turkey. 30. Ghulam Hassan Khan, Haji Ghulam Husain’s messenger, has returned from Penjdeh with the medicines for his employer (paragraph 24 of Diary No. 28). On hearing of his arrival Nasrullah at once came to the Haji’s shop and asked for news of Russia. Ghulam Hassan said that Russia was proceeding vigorously and unitedly with the war and that her armies had recently taken a large number of Austrian and German prisoners. Nasrullah expressed deep regret at hearing this, saying that now the departure of the party would be again delayed. He added that he had sent the letter which Ghulam Hassan would not take to a German at Petrograd, and hoped that an answer would soon come saying that Russia had made a separate peace. 31. The arrival is reported of two Kabulis whom the Amir had sent to Europe two years ago to bring news of the war. Their reports have been sent to His Majesty whose further orders concerning- them are awaited. 32. It is said that two Austrians recently escaped from Kabul but were recaptured and brought back. The Amir has since forbidden them to ride out more than once a week as a punishment. 33. Our Agent heard a rumour on the 27th July that Wagner and Kazim Beg intended to leave shortly for Russia via Mazar-i-Sharif. W. G.

I hear that Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan of Chahar Burjak recently sent a servant, Fateh Muhammad Khan, to Sarhad to buy slaves and rifles. The ser vant induced one Ata Muhammad, son of Misriyan Shahozai“ &amp; jambaz in British service ” to accompany him from Duzdab.

Li 1 / Meshed Diary No. 21, ior the week ending the 26th May 1917. * Persian officials.—Excellent reports are received regarding the condition pt Mazrnan under the rule of Mansur-ul-Mumalik (paragraph 6 last week). • birthday of Imam Husain falhng upon the 25th the Governor-General visited the Shrine on that day. This is the first occasion on which he has left his .quarters since the assassination of the Rais-i-Nazmiah: fear of a like fate hav ing kept him at home. 3. The trial of the persons implicated in the murder alluded to in paragraph 2 above has been entrusted to the local courts of justice. . 4 - Persian affairs—The rates at which grain and bread are to be sold locally during the present scarcity have not yet been definitely fixed. The proposal now is to allow proprietors of grain to sell at any price up to 25 twyans per kharwar that they can get provided that the bread rate remains at 2 brans per man. Nine hundred kharwars of wheat have been issued to bakers from the Government stores at tumans 15. The democrat leaders are not in agreement with the bread rate of 2 brans and accuse the Governor-General of not knowing his mind and taking bribes from the bakers. The matter has been entrusted to Haji Husain Aghapa prominent land lord, for settlement. 5. The Karg'iizar has received a secret telegram from the Foreign Secretary in connection with the coming elections. He is directed to report at once in case the election of any unfit person is probable, and to issue instructions to his sub ordinate Kargnzars to do likewise. 6. British affairs .—It seems that Haji Husain Agha (paragraph 5 above) has secured, by purchase via Tehran, a British rifle with 130 rounds of ammunition. He has promised us to retain them for his personal use and on no account to dispose of them without reference to us. 7. It is commonly reported in the town that Russian influence in northern Persia has ceased with the change in the Russian Government, and general approval is expressed at the supposed prospect of British influence being paramount for the future. 8. Russian affairs. —A local committee has been elected of Russian subjects, which consists of a member of the Russian Bank staff as president and one or two representatives of the local mercantile community, among whom is M. Popoff, the Manager of Xobel and Company, with an equal number of Muslims, as members. This assembly is to meet on Wednesday, but what they will find to do here has not yet transpired. Nothing more has been heard of the proposed Military Committee. 9. Dabir-us-Sultan (paragraph 13 of Diary No. 19) is still at Askabad, and the Karguzar continues to receive complaints against him tmi Tehran. 10. The export of the last 2,000 kharwars of the 5,000 for which M. Xicolsky had obtained the consent of the Persian Government having been ordered to be made from Kuchan some feeling against it has been shown both there and at Shirwan. The people seem to fear that more will be demanded but of this they need not be afraid {vide paragraph 9 last week). 11. Persian and German Intrigues. —The murder of Matin-us-Saltanah, a pro- ally journalist of Tehran, is announced. No details are to hand. 12. At a democrat meeting held on the 17th instant stirring speeches were delivered condemning the export of grain from Persia during a time of scarcity, and were warmly received by those present. Abuse of Najd-us-Saltanah, late Peshkar-i-Maliyah, was indulged in in this connection, and finally it was decided to make a list of all grain stores in Meshed and to watch their disposal. A secret meeting was held on the 23rd. Regret was expressed that the society had been unable to reduce the rate for the sale of bread from 2 krans per 1man Later the sale of grain to Russia by Najd-us-Saltanah was again ref erred to but Haii Muhammad Jafar appears to have pointed out with reason that the NRd sold only 2,000 kharwars of wheat, which was his own property to dispose of as he wished. Finally the coming elections were discussed, and the necessity for ensuring the election of good Muslims only was dwelt upon, 13 News from Turbat-i-Hadari. —It is now said that htabil-ud-Daulah (paragraph 5 of Diary No. 19) will not take up the pdst of Karguzar at Turbat, although his assistant has actually arrived there as Mmjallal-us-Saltanah has arranged his case at Tehran and will be reinstated. 14. Further rioting on the part of Russian Cossacks is reported in Turbat L. 15 The following prices obtain at present: wheat, tumans 22 and barley, tumans 15 per kharwar ; lamb, 3 krans, mutton, 4J hrms, ghee, 28 and loaf sugar, 32 krans per man. 16. A dispute culminating in the murder of a woman is reported from Khush Darah. 17 Newas from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —M. Lemansky has arrived in Meshed. MM. Mikhailoff, Popoff, and Lemansky have now all been removed. 18 News from Karez.—The price of grain here seems to be terribly high; one man of good ghee being given in exchange for nine of wheat. 19. News from Herat. —The return of the Turkoman chief Kurban Muhammad to his home has been delayed (paragraph 25 last week) pending the receipt of permission from the Amir. 20. Orders have been issued for the report to the Local Government of all deaths, with the cause and date of decease. Such reports will be submitted monthly to Kabul, 21. The construction of the newJDurbar Hall at Chahar Bagh is commencing. 22. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has forbidden the cultivation of rice this year owing to the scarcity of water. 23. Nasrullah visited Haji Ghulam Husain (paragraph 30 of Diary No. 20, etcetera) and enquired about Saiyid Husain (paragraph 18 of Diary h^o. 18), The Haii replied that he had been arrested at Karez and sent to Meshed, and that he must decline to have anything further to do with such missions, as the Naio- ul-Hukumah would be much displeased were he aware of his participation. Nasrullah replied that should this case come to the ears of the Naib he would have to decline to help in sending any more messengers for Wagner, and begged the Haii to restrain Saiyid Husain’s family from reporting it to him. (A. Ihis apprehension throws light upon Wagner’s desire to keep these matters secret trom the Naib, whose conduct is admirable.) 24. Abd-ur-Rahman is reported to be leaving for Meshed,^ where efforts will be made to apprehend him. He is reported to be coming via Hashtadan. We have not yet succeeded in tracing his nephew (paragraph 30 last week). 25. Wagner is reported to be enquiring carefully into the state of Chakansur and the Sistan frontier from arrivals from that direction. 26. Kazim Beg’s servant Asghar is said to have stated on the 15th that Hentig must have arrived in his country via China by this time, bearing agreements between the Afghan Government and Germany ; and that he would soon return with a large force, thereby securing the success of the German mission to Afghanistan. 27. Wagner has deliverd Bayed’s servant Saiyid Riza to the Naib-ul-Hukumah for imprisonment on account of quarrelsomeness and contumacy. Relations are said to be strained at present between Wagner and Bayed. 28 Nasrullah is said to have stated on the 17th his opinion that Ahmad Barbari was responsible for the arrest of Saiyid Hussam. (N. B. The reverse was the case). 229. It is reported that Abd-ur-Eahman (paragraph 22 above) endeavours to conceal from the public his connection with the German party. 30. Condition of the Country. —The matter referred to in paragraph 8 last week has reached the usual conclusion. The head of the Zushki robbers has paid J 500 tumans to the leader of the troops sent out to deal with him and 500 to the I Governor-General, who has accepted his submission and appointed him to keep order in the districts he formerly raided. Certain villagers of the neighbourhood knowing what this means for them, have themselves become outlaws, and the robber chief has celebrated his appointment by raiding Taimuri shepherds in the Jaghark hills and relieving them of tumans 2,000. 31. Haji Husain Agha has persuaded the Governor-General to send out 45 Barbari sowars to punish the Shikari robbers who have interfered with the water supply of his lands near Chinaran. (This particular gang of robbers are ordinarily under his protection.) 32. Complaints against the present Governor of Gunabad are general. 33. The Chief of Bujnurd has again been warned by the Home Secretary in connection with his encroachment on Shuja-ud-Daulah’s district of Kuchan. Meshed : W. G.

D.Meshed Diary No. 28, for the week ending the 14th July 1917. 1. Persian officials. —The Governor-General is now the subject of references in the local pulpits ; two preachers having recently spoken of him in uncomplimentary terms in the course of their orations. 2. The Mutwali Bashi has submitted his resignation to the Shah, but 44 prominent traders of the city have telegraphed to Tehran urging that the resigna tion should not be accepted. The reason for this step on the part of the Mutwali is said to be his inability to keep order in the Shrine. 3. Persian affairs (local). —The agitation against the enrolment of a brigade of Persian Cossacks here (paragraphs 2 and 21, last week) continues with increased force. About 30 persons, who appear to be representative of a large part of the town population, waited upon the Governor-General to protest formally, and this party, which was led by the democrat leader Haji Muhammad Jafar Kashmiri, w T as supported by the presence of some leading officials who attended not as part of the deputation, but as being tacitly in sympathy with the movement. His Excellency, after outwardly sympathising with the objectors and dismissing them with a promise to submit their petition to Tehran, sent to M. Nicolsky and asked what he should do. My colleague replied that he should inform the people that the Cossacks were for their own good, to preserve order and prevent crime. Two nights later no less than 300 persons came to the Ark and were given the explanation suggested by M. Nicolsky being told in addition that the Russian troops to the presence of which they had so often objected, would be withdrawn as soon as the Cossack brigade was formed. To this they replied that they would prefer more Russian troops to their own brigade under Russian officers as the Russian | rank and file now sympathised with democracy. Finally the gathering dispersed with an assurance from Kamran Mirza that he was powerless in the matter, but would refer it forthwith to Tehran. The agitation seems to be an anti-Russian intrigue, but it is unfortunate that Colonel Mamanoff has not been very well advised in his choice of enlistments, and the trouble is partly due to the misbehaviour of his own men. I called upon my colleague and offered to help, but beyond good advice and similar explanations to those already given no action on our part seems to be possible. 4.. The grain and bread question has again become acute. M. Kornelis has been compelled to desist from his attempts to raise the price of revenue grain and to cause private supplies to be sold at a cheaper rate, and the Governor-General seems to be unable to keep the price of the latter from rising. The sale from the revenue supply being necessarily limited to a small number of Jchanvars daily, the price of bread has again a tendency to rise. Kamran Mirza has now appointed Sbahzadah Mustafa Mirza, a prominent democrat and a strong man, as a sort of Town Governor in special charge of this question. 5. Persian affairs (general). —Great distress is reported fromKhaf, where real famine conditions exist. 6. The Governor-General has telegraphed to the Home Office suggesting that a certain time be given to the Chief of Bujnurd in which to arrest Khuddu (para graph 8, last week and previous Reports), and that Shirwan should be removed from his jurisdiction in case he fails to apprehend him within the time fixed. 7. The father of the offending Naib-ul-Hukumah of Gunabad (paragraph 6, last week) has been arrested in Meshed, and will probably be made to pay the com pensation for the post robbery which his son has failed to produce. 8. Our enlistment of Barbaris for various Indian regiments continues apace, and the fact that no objection is raised in any quarter is the subject of much comment, in view of the agitation dealt with in paragraph 3 above. g. t /*—-v ^ L t-.A9 Russian affairs.— morts, wliicli are being opposed by certain officials, are bein^ 'made by the Russian Consul-General to foreclose a mortgage held by the Russian Bank on the property of the Rais-ut-Tujjar, who has failed to pay two instalments of money borrowed from the Bank. 10. The Dabir-us-Sultan, (paragraph 17, last week), has applied^ formally to renounce the status of a Russian protege, and is being actively assisted by the Karguzar, who has evidently received a hint to be careful m regard to Persians becoming foreign proteges. 11 Persian and German intrigue. —We discovered that the Governor-General had promised the democrats to appoint the celebrated MunshiNizam as Chief of Police, and he has been induced to cancel his promise, but we have not finished with this person, who has just arrived in Meshed. 12. During the weekly meeting of the democrat society one of the extremist party (paragraph 19, last week) drew his revolver on the leader, Haji Muhammad Jafar, and was with difficulty restrained from doing him serious injury. 13. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Careful enquiry has been made regarding three suspicious Europeans who were supposed to have been seen in Turbat district. The report appears to have been false. 14-'Robberies by Baluch have taken place at and near Dahana-i-Durpal, two farsakhs from Turbat; and a conflict has occurred at Alyak between the Baluch inhabitants and a Revenue official who came to collect money due by them. 15. It has been decided that the new postal service should travel by the Faizabad route owing to the presence of rebber gangs on the usual road via Robat-i-Kamai. - 16. News from Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam. —Efforts have been made both by our men and by the Russians to find Abd-ur-Rahman (paragraph 34, last week) but without success. 17. The Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan with 100 sowars are still m the neighbourhood. Rumours have reached the Russians that the former has been speaking contemptuously of them, and they have asked Kamran Mirza to direct Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakhurz, to disperse the gathering. 18. Shaukat-ud-Daulah has not returned to Meshed, but it is said that the brothers have come to some understanding (paragraph 25 last week). 19. News from Karez. —The Customs Superintendent has been asked by M. Kornelis whether it is true that the grain has been exported from his district to Russian territory. He has replied in the negative. 20. M. Kornelis has directed that 300 kharwars of wheat be sent to Meshed from the Government store, and the balance in hand, 353 kharwars, retained for local sale. 21. News from Herat. —The number of Baluch emigrant families (paragraph 27&gt; last week) has increased to 200. I have informed my colleague of this. The reason for this emigration seems to be nothing but excessive scarcity in Russian Turkestan. - , 22. Orders have been passed by the Naib-ul-Hukumah prohibiting the export of sugar for the present owing to local stocks being low. 23. The arrest at Anardarah of some deserters from the Khawanin sowars is reported. The orders of His Majesty the Amir have been asked for concerning them. 24. Hearing that Haji Ghulam Husain (paragraph 23 of Diary No. 21 and previous reports) was sending a man to Panjdeh to buy medicines, Nasrullah asked him to allow the man to take a letter for the Russian post and perform other services for the German party. The Haji refused again to help them. (Probably this is the result of our letter thanking this man for helping us in connection with the capture of Saiyid Husain recently. He appears to have come round to us anew.)m 25. Maulvi Barkat-ullah is reported to have been rather seriously ill during the week ending the 6th July. 26. The departure of Abd-ur Rahman Khan (paragraph 16 above) is being kept very quiet by the German party, who say in answer to enquiries that he has gone to Kabul. 27. Kazim Beg is trying to injure our Agent by representing him as a Babi and urging upon the people that as such his execution is an incumbent duty. 28. Bayerl sold a mule for tumans 60 on the 4th instant. 29. Wagner and Kazim Beg visited the Naib Salar on the 5th separately and privately. What passed has not transpired. 30.

R uss ia n /orce,—-Colonel Gustchin, whose departure is postponed for e presen ow mg to the illness of his 2nd-in-command of the regiment, is uneasy as to the manner in which the relaxation of discipline in Russia may react on his men here. He complains that the officer in command of the militia company exerts a most unfortunate influence both on his own men and on the Cossacks, hut states that under present circumstances there is not the slightest hope of secur ing his removal, ® r Owing to the difficulty of obtaining forage in consequence of the drought a change of some of the Cossack posts to the south of Meshed may become necessary. At present the neighbourhood of Kain, the most important portion as regards Checking German communications, does not seem to be affected, 241. Persian Cossack Brigade, —Reference to paragraph 137, Colonel Mamonov is finding the greatest difficulty in realising the programme outlined therein. The expense of forage this year has practically stopped his enlistment of mounted men, tomans 6 being allowed for the keep of a horse which costs at current rates not less than double fffie amount per month. He is also reporting to Tehran that the rates .allowed for infantry— tomans 5 per month and uniform and equipment—are totally insufficient either to obtain recruits or to maintain them when obtained, as prices rule. Without considering the pay and allowances of our own levies, the Treasury Gendarmerie receive a monthly pay of 9 tomans with uniform and underclothing, including a horse kept at Government expense and the property of Government, and unless similar concessions be made to the Persian Cossacks, Colonel Mamonov is of opinion that the scheme will prove unworkable. He has at present 216 infantry and a few mounted men. 242. German emissaries Military Agent has received information from more than one source that Pujen and Schonemann had recently left Isfahan dis* guised as pilgrims via Anarak either for Meshed or Afghanistan. A reference to Isfahan elicited the information that Pujen was last heard of near Burujird two months ago making his way westwards, and that nothing had been heard of Schonemann. In reply to a warning regarding the possible passage of Sven Hedin, the General Staff at Tashkent reply that they have been looking out for him since January. •. * Herat and Afghanistan^ 243. Germans and adherents,-?—The, Russians have heard that Kazjm Beg is likely to attempt escape to Russian territory and thence to Bokhara in collusion with Kurban Muhammad (Junaid) whose departure from Afghanistan the change of conditions in Russia may permit. According to our information this week Kazim Beg has been trying to enter into closer relations with Junaid, but the Naibr ul-Hukumah has forbidden mettings of an overt nature. Reports have also reached the Russians independently of the arrival of Mohendro Partap at Zebak and of his intention of entering Wakhan. He was said to be accompanied by a mehmandar and an escort of seven cavalry. At Mazar-i- Sharif he made presents of value to the principal officials, and is said to have left the best impression. 244. Artillery. —As a measure of economising forage all horses except those necessary for the daily work of the garrison, and sufficient artillery horses for one battery, have been sent out to pasture. Grass is scanty but it is expected to tide over some weeks. A field gun was taken out for practice and five hits scored out of 14 rounds but no details of range are given. • 7 it li II i .i n ;2 245 Organisation. —On the statement of the Naib Salar that the Herat garrison is to be organised in three brigades, orders were given for the formation of three brigade bands from the ten now existent, the change being accompanied by a considerable reduction in the personnel of the musicians., 246 Uniforms. —A free issue of one uniform has been made to all officers who are in addition entitled to two further suits on purchase. 247. Kandahar.;— Recent Russian information places the Kandahar garrison at— ~ • Nurzai Battalion. 1,000 strong. Armed Martini-Henry. Herati Kotawali „ 200 „ „ 3 -shot ~ English ~ rifles. Khasadar-i-Jadidi, 1,800 strong. 2 battalions to be formed from them. Risala Kabuli, 400 strong.. Armed M.-H. carbines. 10 men per squad ron with lance. 2 batteries with new B.-L. guns (“ side loaders ).. 2 batteries M.-L. guns. 3 maxims- A recent arrival from Kandahar at Herat reports six battalions up to strength and much activity in enlistment; also that discharged soldiers from Herat, on arrival at Kandahar, are being re-enlisted there. 248. Zulfiqar .—An agent reports* from Zorabad that the post at Dahna-i- Zulfiqar has been increased to 160 men and that he is remaining in the neighbour hood to ascertain the reason. Russian Turkistan. 249 Current u/airs.—Insecurity as regards property prevails at Tashkent^ thefts both on a large and small scale being of frequent occurrence. Natives conscripted for work in Russia are deserting freely, steps towards their early rep Ration having apparently proved a matter of difficulty. Orders have been issueci for a strick watch to be kept on trains at Kazahnsk on the Tashkent-Orenburg line, and on steamers reaching Krasnovodsk. Any citizen- natives” who appear to have deserted their post are to be detained under guard -p^ rptiirn to nlaces whence thev have fled. According to Colonel Mamonov complete military disorganisation prevails at Askhabad. General Narbut is nominally in command but has practically no authority.. In addition to the difficulty experienced in passing through the arms for the Cossack Brigade, the most absurd rumours were current. The 14 Cossacks detailed to bring the arms were magnified into 140, while another 500 Persian Cossacks were said to be in waiting on the frontier: the two orderlies accompanying Colonel Mamonov represented a “ detachment.” The object of all this was variously ascribed to an attempt to smuggle the Tsar into Persia, and a Persian coup de main on Askhabad. 250. Yomud Turkoman .—An article in the “ Askhabad ” states that in the course of General Madritov’s operations 100,000 sheep, 4,500 camels, and 1,200 horses in addition to cattle and tents, were taken from the Yomud, whose out look from this cause and the drought is a black one. Colonel Khan Yomudski and M Ivanov, the former Russian Consul at Astrabad, have been deputed to organise measures for the relief of these people, their task including the reconcilia tion of the Turkoman with the Russian settlers coupled with a sound adminis trative basis, and material help to the distressed Turkoman. The rising is attributed to the Turkomans’ fear of the unknown involved by the edict for the supply of labourers. General Kuropatkin s orders were that the troops were not to commence hostilities, and an enquiry into the origin of the conflicte was in progress.3 251. Bokhara and Khiva .—A meeting of the New Bokhara Executive Com mittee, attended by all Russian inhabitants, after a stormy session resulted in accusations against M, Miller of double-dealing and demands for his removal. A letter written by a member of his staff to a Cazi, proving his reactionary sympathies, ^ was produced, and it was decided to place the matter in the hands of the Samarkand Committee who were present on the occasion. Distrust is expressed in the manifesto of the Khan of Khiva, the frequent references in it to the Shariat being taken to nullify all practical benefits. It is recalled that in 1905, under pressure, the Khan issued orders for a constitution, which he revoked subsequently after a short interval. # 9 G. U. Press, Simla.—No. C. 258 F.D.—11-8-17—9—E.

Russian force. —The Adjutant of the Semirechia Cossacks informs me that the attitude of the men is now more satisfactory, the symptoms of unrest which they displayed haying to a great extent disappeared, 253. Persian Cossack Brigade. —The officers of this force are unable to obtain the small number of Barbaris required (paragraph 137). Having regard to the difference of terms offered by the brigade and our own levies, and the apprecia tion of the value of money inherent in the Barbari, this result is not surpris ing. 254. Punitory expedition. —The negotiations noted in paragraph 218 have broken down owing to Muhammad Zushki’s prudent mistrust in the good faith of the Persian authorities. Some 60 Barbari sawars, followed by an equal number of footmen inspired by the prospect of unearned increment among the villages to be “ protected,” have left for the scene of action under the leadership of the brother of the late Ahmad Ali Shah. It is understood that this individual has made the headship of the Barbaris, an office for which he is singularly unfitted, the condition of his services to the Governor General. 255. German emissaries. —Pujen, when engaged in commercial transactions in pre-war days, enjoyed the services of two individuals who, there is good reason to believe, have since acted as German agents making occasional meteoric appearance at Meshed. Concerning the complicity of the first—identical with Hassan Agha, paragraph 138—there is little doubt. He has not been seen here lately. Descriptions. —Hassan Lari.—Age 30 to 35. Medium height. Fair com plexion. Grey eyes. Fair hair worn long and frequently, dyed with henna. Short beard. Small thick and fair mustache. Wears either round turban of the “ merchant ” pattern or kullaJi. Headquarters apparently Tehran whence he travels via Bussia. Karbelai Ali.—Age 35 to 40. Medium height. Brown complexion. In flamed eyes. Short black beard with small thick mustache. Marked with small pox. Wears ordinary turban and Persian aba. Colonel Mamonov detained Shonemann at Kirmanshah in 1915 and telegraphed urgently to Tehran for permission to arrest him. This was, however, refused him on the ground of Persian neutrality. He gives the following description : age 30 to 35, tall, slim, square shoulders. Fair complexion and hair, grey eyes. En ergetic manner and carriage. 256. Russian affairs. —An Executive Committee on the lines of those in Russia, has been formed from the Russian subjects at Meshed, representatives of all classes of the community having bee n included. Herat and Afghanistan. 257. Germans and adherents.—-Wagner is manifesting considerable curio sity regarding affairs (and possibly routes) in Sistan, taking steps to interrogate arrivals from Chokansur and Anardarrah on the subject. The Persian Abdurrahman is reported to be shortly leaving for Meshed via Ha'shtadan. From talk among the German party it is inferred that yon Hentig was pro-] vided with a copy of a German-Afg han agreement, possibly a' duplicate of the document which Paschen conveyed to Tehran. ! | | 1The departure of Kurban Muhammad (Junaid) is postponed pending permis sion from the Amir. 258. Reorganisation. —The Xaib Salar has formed three infantry brigades from the Herat troops constituted as follows :—■ 1st Brigade, — Khaki battalion. Ghaznichi battalion. Logari battalion. 2nd Brigade. — Kandhari battalion. 3rd Herati battalion. • Jadidi Kabuli battalion. 3rd Brigade. — Jaddi Herati battalion. 9th Herati battalion. Kotwali battalion. The establishment aimed at per battalion is 4 companies of 150 men each. As soon as the Khasadars have been sufficiently organised and trained, they will under the name of the 10th battalion, be substituted for the Kotwali battahon in the 3rd Brigade. Four drummers and 12 buglers are allowed per battalion, and a band is allotted to each brigade. 259. Recruiting. —The intention of the Naib Salar to raise a third cavalry regiment, and to recruit sufficient artillery to man all spare guns on hand, is announced. 260. Frontier post. —A mason and some well diggers have been despatched to Chihildukhtaran with orders to report themselves to Rissaldar Yar Muhammad for the purpose of constructing a new frontier post at Kallah Chah. Russian Turkistan. 261. Current affairs. —There is a little news in recent local papers. Their tone on the whole indicates a return to common sense, and local resolutions ad vocating pursuance of the war to the end have been passed. The rider of no annexation or contribution is invariably appended. The postal department is hopelessly disorganised, and Petrograd newspapers are received irregularly and after long intervals. The long winded addresses which every two-penny half-penny little community have seen fit to despatch to the Provisional Government would seem enough in themselves to account for disorganisation in the telegraph department. The question of conscripted native labourers appears to have been freely muddled. It was first announced that having been unjustly conscripted they should be repatriated without delay. No efficient steps to this end were taken and orders were consequently passed that deserters were to be rounded up and returned to their place of labour. In the meantime Sarts and others compulsorily working in Russia have represented their case to the Provisional Government by whom their requests have been sympathetically received. The supply question still presents difficulties, stocks in hand are short, and no efficient general scheme for supplying the country as a whole has yet been worked out. Bread ration for prisoners of war has been reduced to 1 Jib per diem. 262. Rivers. —Want of water for agricultural purposes in the Zerafshan, owing to the poor snow-fall, is causing anxiety. The scarcity is said to be of a temporary nature which the thawing of the glaciers later in the season will remedy. Owing to low water in the Amu Darya steamer traffic between Charjui and Faizabad Kalah has been discontinued.263. Semirechia. Tashkent Committees have deputed a number of delegates, both Russians and natives, to various centres in Semirechia, with the obiect of reconciling as far as possible the Russian and Kirghiz elements, and of organisino’ self-governing institutions on a harmonious and firm basis. 264. General Kuropatkin .—A commission of enquiry, appointed by the Pro visional Government to enquire into the circumstances of General Kuropatkin’s arrest and removal, ha£ acquitted him of any official misdemeanour. It is stated, however, that his political attitude renders the question of his immediate active employment somewhat difficult, and it is hoped to utilise his experience in schemes for completing the reserves for the army.

'Russian force. —Orders are shortly issuing for the abandonment of the Meshed-Jam line, and the withdrawal of the detachment at Jam. Want of water, particularly at the last-named place, is the main cause. It is also intended that the 2 nd and 3rd squadrons based on Meshed should change places with the 1 st and 4th further south. A long letter appears in the “Askhabad” from a Semirechia Cossack thank ing their friends for the agitation which they understand is on foot to transfer the 1 st Semirechia Cossacks to Russia for rest. Apart from their local know ledge and the expense of the move, the men have incurred considerable expense in the purchase of necessary furniture and do not desire to move. The fact that the regiment has more than once applied for service on the battle front is mentioned. I informed the Military Agent that I had heard from several sources that the militia here were informing the towns-people that Russia would shortly con tract a separate peace and they would go to their homes, and that, if true, this hardly made for Russian prestige.^ He replied that ho was not in the least sur prised to hear it as the militia, owing to their want of discipline and soldierly feeling, had given them endless trouble. I should imagine that the military value of these men at the present time is exceedingly small. Many of them are voluntarily hiring themselves out as coolies to Persian masons, and this, though intelligible with the value of the ruble as low as it is at present, does not increase the respect of the Persian man in the street for Russian arms. 335. Persian Cossack Brigade—Sivong feeling against this force is in evidence here, and petitions and telegrams on the subject are being sent to Tehran. The men have unfortunately given ground for complaint by mis behaviour in the town, and the burden of the citizens plaint is ‘ if this is done in the green tree, what will be done in the dry ?” The behaviour of the Persian serbaz is far from irreproachable but no complaints are made anent him, and there is little doubt that democratic dislike to a Russian-commanded force is at the root of the matter. 336. Turhat-i-Sheikh Jam —Letters from agents at Araghun and Lansrar dated the 3rd instant have reached me, according to which the Kaudani Ilbaigi is openly boasting to his followers that as long as they retain their arms and are on the alert no government can touch them. Neither Russians nor English have now any actual power. 337. Germans and adherents. —Kazim Beg has requested the permission of the Naib-ul-Hukumah to spend the month of Ramadan at the Bagh-i-Shah outside the city, from which place he would take his leave at the end of the month. This perhaps explains the reference to the departure of some of the party noted in paragraph 327. The Faib-ul-Hukumah alleged difficulty in guarding the garden in question as his reason for refusal. It is apparently on the authority of Kazim Beg that the Naib Salar announced at Durbar that peace would be concluded in a few weeks, render ing Russia subject to Germany and Turkey, and enabling the last two to fly their flags in all other countries. Barakatullah has sent a servant to Panjdeh to bring news of Russia. The Russians have telegraphed on the subject to Kushk, but although the description given us might ensure the man’s identification, he had left Herat before the KHORASA.N AND NORTH-EAST PERSIA.

All roads leading to the city and likely places in the town have bpen under strict observation for Abdurrahman Khan. Unfortunately his personal description is of the thinnest, and gives little scope to agents. 338. Military .—On account of 'Ramadan the daily parade has been reduced to two hours only, and officers special instruction is given once a week instead of daily. Commanding officers have been directed to furnish a return of all educated officers and Non-Commhsioned Officers, and to hold all Non-Commissioned Officers responsible for the training of their men. Zeal will be rewarded by promotion and sloth punished by dismissal. An influential sayyid requested the Naib Salar to postpone conscription on the 1 per 8 basis for the current year on account of poor harvests and scarcity. The latter regretted that postpone ment was impossible and stated bis intention to proceed with the levy forth with. 339. Grain collection.—bn agent at Zorabad reports on the authority of arrivals from Zulfiqar that 700 kharwars of grain have been stored there, apart from rations which are received from .Herat This is double the quantity originally noted in paragraph 314, but is possibly exaggerated. A further report is still awaited. According to rumours, ^hich require eondrmation, 2 gnus and a body of Barbari sowars have reached Zulfiqar post. 340. Mazar-i-Sharif arrivals .—Travellers who left Mazar about a fort night ago via Russia report all quiet in Afghan Turkistan. Some excitement was caused at Mazar somewhat over a montti ago by the escape from prison of 20 Mangal headmen who attempted to induce soldiers to join them in a dis turbance. They were, however, soon re-arrested. Russian Turkistan. 341. Current affairs. —AT. Stchepkiu has telegraphed from Petrograd that town constitutions w &gt;uld shortly be issue 1 to all principal towns in Turkis tan, and that steps should be taken to prepare for local elections. Peculation is apparently not confined to the old regime as the president of the Tashkent Supply Committee lias been arrested for extensive excursions into illicit but profitable transactions. The Workmens and Soldiers Committee has now taken over supply matters. Of the grain destined for Turkistan for Mav, some 200 wagons had not been received up to the 24th ultimo. A million jowrfs (1,666 tons) had been requisitioned from Russia for June. Though not sufficient it is expected to avert acute distress. A disappointment is probable from Semirechia where harvest prospects are not fulfilling expectations, and Turkistan generally is no longer able to count on the million puds in excess from last year's harvest in Semirechia. Members of the Tashkent police militia have heea arrested for illicit trofflc in wine on a fairly large scale, and deserters discovered working an illicit still at a wayside station. 312. Military affairs .—The Officer Commanding the Turkistan Military District has been notified by the Minister of War that in spite of all efforts to ensure the arrival of drafts at the front, units at the front continued to he steadily depleted. It had therefore been decided to replace the draft system by the despatch of whole reserve battalions with their officers, 250 men of the least fit being left under two officers as a guard at head-quarters. Ko definite action on this order had apparently been taken in Turkistan. It is also notified that officers removed from political or administrative posts in Turkistan would no longer be attached to the reserve of the Caucasus- r* 0 - Intelligence Summary Number 28 for the week ending: the 14th July 1917.

He indicates Saham-ul-Mulk, recently attached to the Governor-General s following in place of Alam-as-Saltanah as most mischievous m this connection. According to his information this young man was an officer of the late Gendarmerie, deeply implicated in the conflict between that force and the Russians some two years ago near Tehran, whence he fled in disgmse to Qum. After an interval he obtained employment with the brother • A a n . 1 t, A iTa’ c ga ' n dlsa PP e ,^ ed a{ter malpractices, and eventually accom- p med the Jnder Secretary for War to Meshed on pilgrimage where he secured his present post.

Herat and Afghanistan. 'Uq. Germans and adherents.—Ihe German party were unsuccessful in prevailing on the Kalantar of the Herat druggists to assist them to convey a letter to Russian territory for posting. They continue to offer mules for sale. Their latest effort to discredit the British Agent in Afghan eyes by attribut ing to him adherence to the Babi sect has met with little success. An arrival from Zulfiqar tells a curious story which, on the face of it, appears circumstantial. He states that between one and two months ago, at a period apparently coinciding with the report of reinforcements at the post noted in paragraphs 248 and 271, two “ Germans , ’ appeared with an escort of 20 Afghan cavalry. They examined the frontier and were loud in their disapproval of the Afghan militaryfauthorities for their selection of the present site of the Dahna-in- Zulfiqar post. The informant saw them himself but was not near enough to be able to give a personal description. The Herat agent has consistently stated that none of the German party have been absent from Herat. At the same time it would appear possible that these may have been the individuals noted in Sistan Field Force Intelligence Summary of the 28th April, paragraph 57. On receipt of the above extract 1 communicated with the British agent on the matter. He stated that no individuals as described had passed through Herat, but that he would keep a look-out for them. As he has reported nothing further on the matter it seems probable that these officers were engaged on a systematic inspection of frontier posts, especially as from Zulfiqar they are said to have proceeded along the line of posts towards Gulran and Chihildukhtaran. On this assumption a divergence to Herat would have been unlikely in the absence of any special business with Wagner. 350. Military .—Probably owdng to Ramadan there is no military news of interest. Both from the details of cavalry reliefs, and from accounts of the strength at frontier posts, between 200 and 250 men of the regular cavalry would appear to be on frontier duty normally. i . 1 Russian Turkistan. 351. Current affairs .—The Petrograd Pan-Russian Mussulman Session has expressed dissatisfaction with the action of Mussulman members of the Tur kistan Committee regarding Mussulman interests in Turkistan. They demand more numerous representatives on the Committee, and the change of some of the present members. It is rumoured that M. Dorrer intends to resign the direction of Trans caspian affairs. Matters do not proceed smoothly in the Supply Committee of that province which has had six presidents in less than two months. A disposition towards strikes exists but so far has had no very serious mani festations. The strike of employes at a private factory at Andijan, and one of drivers and carriers at Askhabad were adjusted in a few days.

R. from Tashkent, and the 8th and 5th from Askhabad have already left, but according to the latest papers their actual departure appears to be in doubt. This action brings the question of home defence for Turkistan very much to the fore and accounts for the recall of the units noted in paragraph 345. It also calls for a rapid decision as to the fate of Russian settlers in Turkistan, hitherto exempted by law from military service. These number from 6,000 to 8000 available men, and a meeting held at Tashkent to discuss their obligation to volunteer their services ended in disorder. The Turkistan Committee has des patched two^ telegrams to Prince Lvov and M. Kerensky on the subject, in the first asking for a reconsideration of the decision to employ reserve battalions as reinforcements and to retain the draft system as far as Turkistan is concerned. As a motive for the request home defence requirements are alleged, but only as secondary to the desirability of retaining the Siberians as a useful social element during the present reconstructive process. The second telegram requests a speedy and final decision as to the liability of Russian Turkistan settlers to military service. Four drafts for the front Tashkent on the 21st ultimo and 2 at Askhabad on the 10th instant. left the 2nd Siberian R. drafts the 8th Siberian R. Regiment at R. R.

As a measure of discipline all soldiers out of barracks at Tashkent are required to carry passes or descriptive documents. In an article to the “ Citizen Soldier ” a correspondent describes a visit to the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps on the Caucasus front. According to him scurvy is all prevalent aad the men suffer much from bad feeding and accommo dation. Some Companies are only 30 strong, but the spirit of the men in the front line was good. While present with the 5th Division Turkish parle- mentaires arrived to propose fraternisation. They were referred by regimental committees to the rear. 353. Turkomans .—A definite split in leading Transcaspian Turkomans is apparent. During a recent session at Askhabad members of the committee attended the house of Khan Yomudski instead of the committee meetings. The Turkoman committee demand that Yomudski be called upon to leave Askhabad and even Turkistan. A correspondent reports the continuance of complete anarchy in the vicinity of Sarakhs. Turkoman robberies of all sorts are reported, the most flagrant case being that of 5 Persian merchants of a large, sum of money. Three of the merchants are reported murdered. Incidentally , if Kazim Beg intends to carry out the departure to Russian territory with Turkoman aid imputed to him, the Sarakhs rayon as it is at present should afford him every facility, Railway iron robberies continue 3,000 fish-plates were carried off from Verst 175 of the C. A. Railway on the 2nd instant. 354. Khiva .—According to the Petrograd Telegraphic Agency, Yomud robberies in Khiva are robberies pure and simple, and have no political object.

Semirechia.—k member of the Turkistan Committee supplies a long account to the “ Den ” of the hopeless condition of many of the Kirghiz in Semirechia. To add to their misfortunes they have been the object of outrage by robber bands apparently composed of Russian criminal elements. The relations between Russian and Kirghiz in Semirechia is one of the points with which the Petrograd Mussulman session supra is dissatisfied. 356 .

(1) I have received corroboration of the report that one “ German ” died at or near Farah last month (see diary No. 21), but have not heard the man’s name. (2) See last week’s diary Another reporter states that two carriers of German letters from Kandahar last April were forwarded by Sardar Ata Muham mad Khan of Chahar Burjak under the guidance of a Sanierani named Annr Khan and a Kharoti, who rode donkeys. The party travelled via Padgi (near Koh Malik Siah), Galugeh and Shoro to Bazman. It seems that these men must be identical with the ‘ ‘ Turks ’ ’ mentioned last week. News from Afghanistan. (1) It is said that the Governor of Kandahar has been rebuked by the Amir for allowing the Deputy Governors of Kala-i-Bist (Ghulam Muhammad Khan Barakzai), Kirtaka (Din Muhammad, Khan) and Hazar Juft (Nazar Muhammad Khan) to encourage raids into British territory. The Governor sent 500 Infantry against the three Deputies, recovering 50 camels, the property of one Baz Muhammad, and 10,000 Krans, the nroncrtv nf one Mahammad Umar Khan.- ^ ^ The two last named Deputy Governors were captured and have been sent to Kabul. Ghulam Muhammad Khan fled to Keg-i-Surkh and is still at large • his village is still occupied by troops. ’ (2) See Diary No. 21, Kadkhuda Haji Gulab Gurgich is said to have presented a slave-girl, a magazine (5-shot) rifle and 50 Tomans in cash to the Governor of Chakhansur and 100 Tomans in cash to the latter’s wife. He has been kindly received, but Abdus Samad Khan, the Afghan Karguzar, tells me that the Govern ment will certainly in the end recover all the balance of revenue outstanding against him. 6 Hud. (3) A Kandahari Brahui, named Shah Nazar Jut, has been raiding Khash (4) The Ishakzai tribe of Kandahar are said to have been refusing recruits for the army. The Persian Excise Contract. See Diary Nos. 13 and 15. A young man named Shahzadeh Abdul Baki Mirza has arrived in Sistan as Director of Excise under Ebtihaj-us-Sultan who has sent me a letter of introduction from Meshed. The youth speaks English and says that he relies upon me for protection. On the other hand the Russian Vice- Consul at Birjand has been giving out that the Excise administration of this province is under his protection, the contractors being Russian subjects. The Imperial Bank of Persia, Birjand. Mr. W. J. Wilkinson reached Birjand from Meshed on the 30th May to take over charge of the local branch of the Bank. Mr. F. Hale is transferred to Kermanshah.

(1) One “ German ” with a servant is reported to have been at Shishaweh (half-way between Kadeh and Bakwa) on the 22nd instant. (2) Two “Germans” (another report says “three”) have come with the Sarishtadar of F arah to IvaJa-i-Iyang. These men appear to be armourers. They are said to be red-complexioned and soldierly men. (3) Two “ Germans ” in Kala-i-Kang are reported by another news-writer to be wearing dhotis instead of trousers. (4) An arrival from Daki Dela states that two strangers arrived there on about the 21st instant from the direction of Saindak. They know no Pashtu or Persian. One man is beardless with a big moustache. (5) Two spies are said to have been sent by the Germans from Kala-i-Kang to Dalbandin to report on the railway. One of the spies is named Abdul Aziz : he has a dark skin and scanty beard. News from Afghanistan. * * (1) The Sarishtadar of the Farah Government reached Kala-i-Kang On about the 21st instant. He is said to have been esorted by 250 sowars. His mission is connected with the transfer of the Revenue contract from the Chakhansut Kadkhudas to the Khans of Farah. It seems probable that' the Chakhansuris will give way in the end and consent to pay the revenues demanded. (2) It is said that 1,000 good breech-loading rifles are coming to Kala-i-Kang ; from Farah to replace muzzle-loaders now with the local troops. It seems possible f that the Sarishtadar and his large escort brought these arms down. (3) The Afghans are said to have recently constructed two new hands on the Helm and at Nad-i-Ali and Deh Dost Muhammad, consequently decreasing the supply of water entering Persia. The Naib Karguzar of Sistan has gone to the border to arrange a settlement if possible. Suspicious characters. ( See Diary No. 28. The two suspects [who are described aS : (1) a man of 60 years, calling himself Yusuf Beg; and (2) a boy of 15] have reached Birjand. They claim to be natives of Kuchan, and confirmation of their statements has, I understand, been telegraphically received from the Russian Consular Agent and the Bank Manager of that place. M. Boulatoff proposes to send the two individuals up to Meshed. The Khidri robbery case. See Diary No. 18. Reliable information has reached Birjand that Zal Beg and seven other men are in chains at Herat in connection with this case. Some mules and turquoises have been recovered from them. ; i d 1 12 The Per so-Afghan harder. It is reported from Awaz that Afghan Ressaldar Muhammad Shah with 20 cavalry sowars came to Chah Karezak on the 16th July and informed the local Persian Frontier officer that the Afghan Government claimed Yezdan, Kabudeh and Chah Karezak. He then returned to Chah Laila but expressed a wish that Haidar Ali Khan, the Persian officer, should meet him at Yezdan on the 27th instant. Mischievous rumours. A report has been circulating through southern Kainat during the week to the effect that 3,000 (or 30,000 ?) Afghans have collected to attack the British instigated thereto by the Naib-us-Saltanek., who has quarrelled with the Amir over the Mahsud question. Iffirst heard this story on the 21st July from Bandan and again from Birjand on the 24th July. It reached M. Boulatoff by telephone from Neh to-day (28th July), and he has urgently telegraphed to me asking for confirmation of the news. He has probably already telegfaphed it to Petrograd, although I once warned him seriously against crediting sensational news from Afghanistan unconfirmed by us. F. B.

This Warrant Officer is believed to have illicitly made Bs. 40,000 during his service in Sistan. He originally came in with the Column as Chief Supply and Transport Officer. (1) See Diary No. 21. It appears that the German and Ai*ab, who were in Kadeh* were armourers who had come from Kabul. The survivor is said to be now in Girishki (1) Thete seems to have been a slight rebellion in Sabzawar* The Jamshidis under Muhammad Amin Khan had accused the Governor of extorting 13,000 Tomans from them and in consequence they looted a caravan taking specie from Herat to Kabul. (2) The Afghan Border Officel* Sartip Mahmud, who lives opposite Shaikh Junaid, is said to have reported to the Amir that the Bussians have massacred 700 Afghan subjects during the recent disorders. He has recommended in consequence that the Afghans should invade and capture Turkestan, which is now ungoverned. The Amir has rejected the proposal. (3) Mir Jehind has sent a letter to the Deputy Governor of Kandahar* (4) See last week’s diary. There are 30 Vahils from Chakhansur in Farah.

Suspicious characters. \ t x (1) Our news-agent at Majnabad (65 miles noith-east of Kain) has arrested two suspicious characters who appear to be either Turkish deserters or German spies fiom Herat. They are being transmitted to Birjand through the Cossack detachment at Kain. (2) It is reported that a party of Afghan Cavalry Sowars, disguised as traders, under one Nizam Muhammad, are in the Zirkuh sub-district of Kainat acting as Intelligence agents.' The Governor of Birjand has been advised to send for them for examination. News from Afghanistan. (1) It is reported that His Majesty the Amir has blown from guns a number of conspirators who were found to be in treasonable correspondence with the ex-Amir Ayub Khan (sic —? Yakub Khan). The names of Abdul Ghafur Khan Nurzai Shams-ud-din Khan Nurzai, Muhammad Hasan Khan Barakzai, Zaman Khan Alizai and Muhammad Amir Khan Alizai are mentioned in this connection. The Dah-bashi on the Chaman border who found the letter enclosed in a piece of wood inside a water-skin is said to have been promoted to Colonel. (2) The Chakhansur Vakils are said to have definitely declined the revenue assessment (7,000 kharwars) of their district, which has been accepted by the Barakzai Khans of Farah. The latter have sent Mushrijfs (bailiffs) to Chakhansur to take over charge of the crops and the arrangements for sowing. News from Kainat. *: / / ■ (1) A fracas occurred on about the 3rd July at Kain between Cossacks and the local inhabitants. A shop-keeper remonstrated with a Cossack for helping him self to some boxes of cigarettes. A fight ensued in which one or two Persians were injured. At the request of the Governor, M. Boulatoft has sent his Munshi to Kain to enquire into the matter. It remains to be seen how the Russian Officer at Kain will act in these circumstances. It is said that now-a-days the Cossacks’ discipline is much relaxed, but incidents of this sort were not uncommon under the old regime. (2) Lieutenant Brenan reports that sugar, soft, is sold in Birjand at 19^ Krans per Tabrizi man. A large consignment is being sent to Meshed, where the wholesale price is 23 to 24 Krans per Tabrizi man. The camel-hire from Birjand to Meshed is 280 Kraris per Tabrizi kharwar. It is said that sugar can be bought at Kerman at 8 Krans a man, and that 500 camel-loads of sugar are about to be despatched to Meshed. The price should therefore soon fall both in Birjand and Meshed. In Sistan the price was 12 Krans a fortnight ago, but it is now 16 Krans. i J r % K- l i li)The Si-stan Field Force. w Some anxiety has been felt this week about the fate of a Sergeant Chauffeur and his Levr Corps guide who left Girdi for Xeh on the 9th instant and ere not heard of again until the 13th when' they walked into Bandan. It appears that the car broke down badly in the desert about 35 miles from Gumbad-i-Khadija, and the men had a bad time., running short of water, before they reached safety. Last year two Cavalry sowars were lost and perished in the same locality. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieutenant-Cdond. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for SisUm and Kain»t ^•'y , y 4y r CONFIDENTIAL.

(2) It is reported that one “ Turk ” and one “ German ” were in Girishk on the 4th July, and that they would reach Chakhansur on about the 17th July. I have not heard of their arrival yet. Suspicious Characters. It is reported that two £ Russians ” have been recently taken in custody through Farah in the direction of Kandahar. They were said to have been captured at Koh-i-Kuch. The Russian Vice-Consul at Birjand has no information about them. News from Afghanistan. (1) It is reported that cholera or some other epidemic has been raging around Kabul. (2) The Brigadier of Chakhansur, Ghulam Ahmed Khan, is very ill. (3) The Deputy Governor of Sabzawar has been relieved of his office and taken to Herat in custody. It is believed that this is in connection with the Khidri robbery case (see Diary No. 18). The name of the new Governor is given as Saiyid Abdul Hamid Khan. Afghan Robbers. . . 0n l4t h February, 9 donkeys out of 40 (the property of a Sistani), carrying British military supplies from Sistan to Robat, were driven over the border from Chah Muhammad Reza by two thieves. Five Levy Corps sowars (without their rifles) and five Persian Government Jambazes from Lutak followed the donkeys’ trail up to Bandar-i-Kamal Khan and thence to Deh Dost Muhan^nad, the Kadkhuda of which place, Sardar Ghulam Haider Khan, arrested the robbers and restored eight of the nine animals. He also took a document off our men testifying that the robbers were not resident in his jurisdiction. The incident seems to prove that the disposition of the Afghan authorities towards us is decidedly good. (2) I hear that the Kadkhuda of Kala-i-Fath, Muhammad Umar Khan, has been summoned to Chakhansur. He is supposed to be in disgrace for harbouring robbers who raid into Persia. (3) The Sistan sub-districts of Shahraki and Narui on the border are still infested with robbers. A villager has been killed in one dacoity case. The brother of Sardar Khudadad Khan was even fired at in broad daylight. Mischievous Rumours. A. large number of stories have been circulating during the week in Birjand and have just reached Sistan to the effect that: (1) Baghdad has been evacuated and burnt by our troops ; (2) the Turks have re-taken Kermanshah ; (3) the Germans have captured Petrograd ; and (4) 200 cossaks have deserted from Meshed. The ££ Bahar ” newspaper of Meshed seems to be chiefly responsible for these palpable untruths, but the Persian telegraph clerks in Meshed, Birjand and Sistan have all joyfully given publication to the reports. The Rais-i-Nazmieh tells me that a telegram from Meshed democrats has also reached the Director of Customs at Sistan on the same subject, telling him to spread the glad news. F. B.

Persian officials. —The arrival of Salar-i-Mufakham, grandson of the late Sipah Solar, on pilgrimage, is announced. 2. Agha Sultan-ul-Ulema, Commissioner of Education, left on 24th instant for Tehran. Agha Muhandis-i-Hamayun will officiate during his absence. 3. The weakness of the [Governor-General seems to be increasing with the growth of democratic power and influence, and he is now almost entirely in the hands of a few advisers who are working against the interests of the Consulates General. M. Nicolsky thinks that we should refrain from asking for his recall as long as possible because he is ours, but this argument is becoming weaker daily as he does less for us and I hope that his relief may soon take place. 4. Persian affairs (Local). —M. Delcorde, having heard from the Grain Com mittee of Meshed that wheat is being exported to Russian Turkestan from Kuchan notwithstanding the warning recently issued by the Governor-General, has tele graphed to his Kuchan deptuy that he intends to send a special inspector to enquire and will hold the local customs officials responsible if the report is found to be correct. 5. A telegram signed by 18 persons, some of whom are democrats, has been despatched to Tehran complaining against the officials, who are said to be making money out of the grain question. The Governor-General is meant by this, but the committee appointed by him to arrange the matter declare that he has made nothing. 6. The Home Office has communicated to the Governor.General complaints on the part of the Excise Department of opposition shown to them by the local Governors in Khorassan. His Excellency denies that such opposition exists. 7. Persian affairs (General)—It is reported from Nishapur that the Zushki robber chief who was recently pardoned by the Governor-General has commenced to raid the district. The Governor has sent out sowars, but scarcely knows how to deal with this man, who is now a protege of the Government. 8. Our late employe Mirza Hasan Khan has taken on lease some villages in Nishapur district the property of the Meshed Shrine, and has commenced to oppress the inhabitants. The Mutwall'i Bashi has been informed. 9. Robbery and murder on the part of Russian Turkomans is reported from the Sarakhs frontier. Their victims were four Baluchis, two of whom were killed on the spot and two escaped to Persian Sarakhs where one of them has since died It is said that this and other incidents are the result of the interpretation placed by these Turkomans upon the new-found liberty of the Russian subject. The matter has been reported to M. Nicolsky. 10. Kuchan and Shirwan affairs shew no improvement. Khuddu is still at large and has now written to the principal mullas and traders of Kuchan demand ing a’free pardon, in default of which he will extend his attentions to them. They have recommended to the Home Office that the pardon should be granted, as they are helpless against the robbers. Meanwhile 170 members of the Zafranlu tribe of Kurds (of whom Shuja-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, is the head) have telegraphed to Tehran complaining that the sowars of the Shadulu tribe (thos6 of the Chief of Bujnurd) are raiding their villages on the pretext of searching for Khuddu, and threatening to take the law into their own hands In case their improper conduct does not cease. 11. The Governor of Turshiz, in reply to a telegram directing him to pay compensation for a recent robbery of the mail, has replied that the road guards have left their work and taken sanctuary in the Revenue Office at Kam. He suggests that instructions should be sent for the arrest of the thieves instead. 12 British affairs.— Out good friend the Karguzar is coming under democratic influence, which in the changed circumstances is natural. He has asked us not to2 make any direct arrests in the town in future, and not to keep any but British subjects in confinement on our premises. We have assured him that his requests will be complied with as a general rule. 13 Russian affairs.— Kavdash Bala, a well-known ruffian and Russian subject who was deported by M. Nicolsky last year, has returned to Meshed without the permission of the latter. I visited M. Nicolsky and informed him of this man’s return. He replied that matters had been arranged with him and that he had promised to leave Meshed whenever required to do so. 14 M Nicolsky’s troubles continue. He had received a general petition from his subjects complaining that their cases are not now being settled by the Persian authorities, and he has in consequence made a representation to the 'Karguzar threatening to report him to Tehran. It is a fact that no Russian cases have been settled for two months. The Karguzar replied plainly that although he had not changed circumstances had, and his work had become more difficult. 15 M. Nicolsky has also made a protest to the Governor-General to the same effect, complaining against the attention he pays to the advice and opinions of unworthy persons. 16. Pefsian and German Intrigues. —Our late Karez agent, Mirza Hasan Khan (paragraph 8 above), has attempted to join the local democrat society, but they have declined to receive such a bad character. 17. The Governor-General has made an enemy of one Haji Husain by entrust ing the surveillance of bakeries to another man whereas it is usually given to him. Haji Husain is organising secret meetings and generally stirring up the lower class merchants against the authorities. 18. An all-night sitting of the democrat committee took place on the 23rd- 24th June. The question of the Barbari community was discussed, and it was said that they used their connection with the British Consulate-General as a means to oppress the people although not with our knowledge or consent. The name of Mirza Hasan Khan (paragraph 16 above) was then introduced and he was freely abused for his crimes at Karez ; but it was remarked that he knew all the secret agents of the British Consulate and could give their names (this is unfortunately true to some extent). However the company agreed that no statement of Mirza Hasan’s could be seriously considered, and refused to believe that some of the persons he had mentioned were secret agents. The unfitness of the Governor-General for his post was again dealt with and it was decided to take further steps for his recall. Finally the despatch of money to Tehran for the purchase of arms was discussed. 19. Some prominent democrats have been heard to say that it is now clear that the British were behind the Russians in all the evil deeds committed by the ‘latter in Persia, and that England and not Russia must now be regarded as Persia s \ chief enemy. 20. Neivs from An.-—Illuminations and general ; .rejoicings m honour of the Shah’s birthday, continued from the 18th to the 20th instant. 21. An incident is reported which throws light upon Mikhailoff’s disinclination to leave Turbat. On the 15th instant the wife of one Meshedi Salih, a Russian subject^ visited him and demanded the sale proceeds of her house which he had sold for Tumans 750. Mikhailoff replied that he had no money and would pay on receipt of a remittance from Russia. The woman insisted and apparently threatened to raise a disturbance, whereat Mikhailoff seized a knife and attempted to take his life. Upon this the wife of the Russian Doctor, who was present, produced the money required and restrained Mikhailoff from doing injury to himself. Prices at Turbat are satisfactory, being lower than those in Meshed. 22. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam—Colonel Scouratt returned from Jam on the 29th. It appears that Ilbaigi Kaudani, who had received news of his coming, sent a message with a letter asking him to come out to meet him and enclosing 100 roubles in gold to pay his expenses. This surprising -manceuvreseems to have inspired Scouratt with a touch of the Ilbaigi’s complaint as he replied regretting inability to leave Jam on account of press of work and inviting the Ilbaigi to Jam with a promise of safe conduct. This invitation the Taimuri did not feel able to accept, so no meeting took place. Shaukat-ud-Daulah (paragraph 14 last week) broke his undertaking with the Governor-General and left for Jam secretly on the night of the 25th instant. He had not arrived at Jam when Colonel Scouratt left, so that the latter was not able to help in the matter of the dispute between the brothers, but we hear that there has been no fighting. Colonel Scouratt’s reception by Shaji-us-Saltanah and their subsequent relations seem to have been all that could be desired. 23. News from Herat. —Fifty of the Turkoman emigrant families reported in paragraph 16 of Diary No. 2 have returned to Russia carrying with them a quanti ty of wheat. 24. The Naib-us-Saltanah has ordered the Naib-ul-Hukumah to recover from Abdul Karim Khan of Dahanah Doab twelve rifles which Saiyid Ahmad Beg Jam- shidi had left with him when passing during his flight from Kabul. Abdul Karim denies that Jamshidi left more than one rifle with him. 25. The Muin-us-Saltanah has ordered the Naib-ul-Hukumah to send 300 kharwars of wool to Kabul. 26. The Risalah Jemadar and sowars who had accompanied Kazim Beg from Kabul to Herat have returned to Kabul, and the Naib-ul Hukumah has appointed the Kot Duffadar of his own escort to replace the Jemadar as escort to Kazim on his riding expeditions. 27. The Naib-ul-Hukumah and Naib Solar lunched with Kazim Beg on Friday, the 15th instant. 28. Puri Khan (paragraph 24 of Diary No. 19) now says that he is the son of a Yusufzai of Ghazni who emigrated to India : that he was sent forcibly by the British to take part in the war : and that he deserted and joined the Turks, by whom he was sent to Herat. 29. A Risalah sowar who has recently returned from Anardarah reports the arrival of a British officer at a Kanat known as Barhnah Kanat on the Persian frontier, and a subsequent discussion which took place between him and the Afghan Risalah in charge of the post in that neighbourhood as to whether the Kanat was in Persian or Afghan territory. The matter had not yet been decided w T hen the sowar left. 30. Bayerl and Wagner are reported to have bought two horses on the 19th instant. 31. On the 21st Bayerl was asked why his party had not left Herat. He replied that they would leave after peace was declared ; and when it was represented that certain of them had in fact quitted the country he pointed out that they were persons with no impedimenta whereas Wagner and he had much baggage and records, the capture of which they feared to risk. 32. A special mail which reached Meshed from Herat on the 29th June brought news of the departure of Abd-ur-Rahman (paragraph 24 of Diary No. 21) from Herat for Meshed, the news of which unfortunately only reached our agent two days after he had left. Enquiries are being made here, and we have some additional information which will help in tracing the man. 33. The transport of grain mentioned in paragraph 16 last week is now contradicted, both as the result of enquiries of our own agents and those kindly made by Nasrat-ul-Mulk. Meshed : W. G.

Russian affairs—The Karguzar has recently been compelled to refer to the Russian Consulate-General-concerning the present conduct of Bukhara! and other Russian subjects, which is impertinent and offensive. He has recently had to turn one such person out of the Karguzari. 15. The Karguzar has received a secret telegram from Tehran ordering him to recover Nawakal or animal-tax from Foreign subjects, and referred to M. Nicolsky who replied that he cannot order his people to pay without orders from his Legation. (This is a matter which comes up every now and then. My predecessor undertook to compel British subjects to pay the tax in the event of Russian subjects being ordered to do so.) 16. A raid was committed three nights ago by the police on the house of a Russian subject, as gambling was supposed to be going on on the premises. No previous notice having been given to the Russian Consulate-General M. Nicolsky has protested and demanded an apology with compensation. 17. The case of Dabir-us-Sultan and the Kuchanis (paragraph 15 of Diary No 24) is not yet finished. Agitation in the press against the Dabir continues, and he desires to renounce the status of a Russian protege. Meanwhile he is still in Meshed, and the Kuchan community have no wish for his return to them. 18. Persian and German Intrigues. —The people of Tun have telegraphed to the Prime Minister urging the release by the Russians of their late Naib Karguzar who was arrested and deported some two years ago for his connection with German intrigues. 19. The local democrats are now divided in their views. One party are extremists who approve of the murder of those who oppose so-called democracy ; one party consider that the execution of such persons is justifiable but only after trial: while the third contend that all such proceedings are inexpedient and that true democrats should work quietly for the good of the nation. 20. The Mutwalli Bashi has attempted to join the democrat society but has been rejected by the Central Committee at Tehran on account of his reputation for dishonesty. 21. At the weekly meeting of the democrats the question of the Persian Cossack Brigade (paragraph 2 above) was discussed. It was represented that these men were really Russian subjects, being under Russian officers : that in case of war they would fight for Russia rather than for Persia : and that the police for the towns and Karasuran for the roads are all the armed force necessary to maintain order. It was therefore agreed that the existence of the brigade was bad for the country. The Tehran Central Committee, replying to the reference made by Meshed democrats regarding the advisability of a change of Governor-General, say that they cannot now find a suitable man for the post, and that Kamran Mirza being weak and pliable will suit their purposes for the present. 22. Neivs from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Shahzada Mujtaba Mirza has been recalled from the post of Excise officer and one Mirza Hassan Khan, late Customs officer of Karez, is appointed in his place. 23. M. Antipoff, the new Russian Vice-Consul, is now employed in enquiring into irregularities said to have been committed by M. Mikhailoff during his incumbency of the Consulate. 24. Complaints have also been made to Tehran by the Karasuran of Turbat that they are not being paid {vide paragraph 1 above). 25. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Colonel Scouratt called on the 30th ultimo to discuss Jam affairs. He seems to think that nothing more need be done in regard to the Ilbaigi as the latter has no unfriendly feelings towards the Russians and is merely afraid to risk being arrested again. This view is probably correct and in time the Ilbaigi will recognise that a mistake was made which Scouratt has intention to repeat. no'lllvluy .ers M event onuses, i H, i* lo oi Biin wti witi Gem le party i esentedW jeenP is OB 11 Regarding Sliaji-ns-Saltanah and Shaukat-ud-Danlah Colonel Scouratt agrees that Shaukat should be recalled to Meshed as soon as possible and the Ilbaigi with his section of the Taimuris transferred to some land near Meshed and further from the frontier. He has urged these two points upon M. Nicolsky and we have strongly lecommended their enforcement to the Governor-General who, however, says that he has not the power to transfer the Ilbaigi. There has been no open quarrel betv een the brothers, and it is said that Shaukat will in any case return as soon as he has collected money due to him from the tribe, of which, being the eldest son of the late chief, he is recognised by them as the head. 26. News from Karez. It is reported that a Kakari, said to be a British subject, has been killed in the Zurabad neighbourhood. Enquiry is proceeding. 27. News from, Herat. The arrival of seventy Baluch families from Russian territory via Dahan-i-Zulfikar is announced. They have been granted land near Herat by the Naib-ul'-Hukumah. 28. The Naib Solar lias obtained Rs. 5,000 from the Naib-ul-Hukumah for the purchase of iron from Russian Turkomans, who smuggle it across the frontier. 29. Kazim Beg seems to have some idea of leaving Herat shortly. He attempted to obtain permission from the Naib-ul-Hukumah to live as his guest in Bagh-i-Shah, outside the town, urging the heat of his town quarters as a reason for the change and saying that he would take final leave of the Naib from Bagh-i- Shah. The A aib declined the honour of receiving him, apparently having a suspicion that he intended to escape. 30. It is now thought that Kazim is not a Muslim as he does not keep the fast and appears merely to conform outwardly to certain duties. 31. Nasrullah informed the Naib Solar on the 24th June that Russia had made a separate peace with Germany. What reply he received is not reported. 32. Nasrullah has sent a messenger to Panjdeh in search of Russian news. (The Russians have been informed.) 33. The Naib Solar stated in Durbar of Military officers on the 25th ultimo that peace would be concluded among the belligerent Powers in fifteen days: that Russia would then come under Turkish and German rule : and that all the nations would recognise Turkish and German suzerainty. (This is supposed to be the result of Nasrullah’s information mentioned in paragraph 31 above.) search and enquiry have not ceased. The horse upon which he rode out of Herat may have gone straight to Tehran. 35. Baverl’s servant Saiyid Riza has been released from apparently sent by one Haji Muhammad Husain, a Meshed trader, probably through the lease-holders of the Meshed Shrine property at Herat, in which the Naib Solar himself is a shareholder. Investigation is being made secretly into this matter.

E. Persia. 807. Bushian jorce .—Colonel Skuratt lias left for Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam and Kariz with the object of re establishing his intelligence system disorganised by the dismissal of M. Lemanski. Presumably the question of the romival of Cossack posts on the Meshed- Jam road, and at Jam itself will depend on the report rendered by him on bis return. 308. Turbat-i Sheikh Jam .—The Kaudani Ilbaigi and Mir Baqi Sultan entered Mahmudabad near Jam on the 15th instant with a following of 200 to 300 armed men. Their presence is apparently the result of an intrigue to dispossess Sliajji-as-Saltanah from the governorship in favour of his elder brother Shaukat-ad Dauiah, who was not long ago released from confine ment for the murder of the late Nusrat-ul-Mulk. The presence of these men has caused natural alarm in the vicinity and armed Barbaris are reported to have assembled with the object of protecting B irbari households should it become necessary. Latest news from Herat seems to render a proximate move on the part of the Germans improbable. It is obvious, however, that disturbed conditions in this tract will facilitate either their own passage or that of their messengers, more particularly having regard to the fact that the original arrest of the IlbaLi and liir Baqi by the Bmssians was motived by suspicious of pro- German activity. 309. Pilgrimage *—One Chaush Abdullah has circulated tbe information, on the reputed authority of a telegram from Tehran, that roads in the vicinity of Kerbela are now safe for pilgrims owing to the presence of British troops, and Shiahs are reported to be much encouraged thereby. 310. Disorders .—The head of a robber and ten living members of the band were sent into Meshed from Marishk during the week. Bobberies are reported from Jimabad, Kijki, Barashk, and even from Turugh some 7 miles distant from Meshed. 311. Gendarmerie .—Orders have been issued to disband the Maliyat gendarmerie of whom there are over 100 stationed at Meshed. It is not very clear what efficient steps have been proposed to replace them. 312. Deserter .—One Sohawi, stating that he is a sepoy in the 10th In- Lantry who was captured by Arabs when purchasing dates near Kurna, was brought in during the week. His story does not bear the stamp of probability and he has been despatched to Birjand in charge of a party of Barbari recruits. No answer has yet been received to a reference to his regimental centre. Herat and Afghanistan. 313 Germans and adherents —Wagner’s servant Nasrullah has purchased another 200 rubles worth of Prussian notes. Apart from this circumstance the Herat report this week points to a continuance of the German stay at Herat. Bayerl has^sold one horse and attempted to sell others, and the Persian Abdur rahman has also sold a horse. Wagner and Kazim Beg are reported to have been much encouraged by the contents of letters received, which formed the subject of a very confidential conference between them and the Naib-ul- Hukumah ; an Austrian being posted at the door during the interview to discourage eavesdroppers. Their funds have also been refreshed, the Naib Salar having cashed a draft‘received by him on Wagner’s account of tfcwaaws 1,000 through the post of Abdullah Khan, the Afghan trade-agent at Meshed. Various enquiries here and at Herat have so far failed to establish the identity of the merchants by and on whom the draft was drawn. Wagner has ordered that in future the Bagh-i-Kartah is to be referred to as “ tbe Consulate.” 31 jf } UP2 The general description of Gtmlam Baza, the messenger whom Wagner is expected to despatch with a letter before long is as follows : Age about 22. Light complexion, tall and good looking. Long hair, wears no beard, is now wearing Afghan costume. 314. Collection of supplies.—On hearing a vague report of the collection of supplies on the “ Busso-Afghan frontier ”, I despatched an agent to make enquiries. He reports having passed the first half of the month at Zorabad whence he paid several visits to the Afghan Sadbashi at the post at Lahna-i- Zulfiqar, where he found camels delivering grain, both wheat and barley, for storage up to the total amount of about 600 loads. The camel men informed him that they had orders to deliver as much grain as possible between Zulfiqar and Kushk or Chihildukhtaran. Beckoning the normal load per camel the grain would amount to some 340 kharwars or over 100 tons, an abnormally large amount for so inconsidera ble place, the normal garrison of which does not exceed 100 men and is frequent ly below that total. Reports have been received that orders have been given in the usual course to collect grain at government caravansarais }&gt; but again this explanation does not appear entirely to account for the quantity. The agent has been ordered to remain in observation, and the matter has been brought to the notice of the British Agent at Herat. On informing the Russian Mili tary Agent with a view to enquiries from their side I particularly impressed on him the paramount necessity of the avoidance of any alarm in Turkistan. 315. Barrack construction.—IhQ Naib Salar summoned the head mason and told him that in pursuance of orders from Kabul all military barracks were to be replaced by new ones, and that in consequence he was to set about dismantling all barracks forthwith. The foreman sensibly replied that the construction would be a long job, particularly as work ou the Salam-Khanah of the Kaib-ul-Hukumah was also to be undertaken, and suggested proceeding piecemeal. The Naib Salar concurred, and it was decided to commence wim the dismantling and reconstruction of the barracks of the Khaki battalion, 40 soldiers and 50 prisoners being detailed daily for the necessary labour. A two-storied barrack with verandah is being aimed at, the Indian doctor supplying the necessary expert advice. 316. Promotions .—After examination in the Pield Exercises, 8 sepoys of the 9th Herati battalion were promoted to subadar, and 11 to havildar. 317. Reliefs .—7 0 cavalry sowars under a risaldar have left for the relief of detachments on the Ghurian frontier. x 318. Uniforms .—Tailors have been ordered to have all new uniforms for the Herat garrison completed by the end of the first half of Ramadan. 319. Government stables —As a spur to their zeal the Naibsof the various stables have been informed that their pay will be withheld until each can enlist 5 serviceable grooms for work in the stables. Russian Tuukistan. 320. Current affairs. —M. Stchepkin, accompanied by two other members of the Turkistan committee left Tashkent for Petrograd on the 8th June to confer with the Provisional Government. JV1. Lipovski was appointed to represent him. The Tashkent Soldiers Committee desire the replacement of Stchepkin by Nalivkin, a member of the 2nd Duma. Other committees are reported desirous of retaining Stchepkin in bis present position. The offices of the District Administration at Askbabad have been totally destroyed by fire. There appears no doubt that incerciarism is at the bottom of the occurrence, prompted by the desire to destroy inconvenient records of various pecuniary transactions, Ihe revision of which had been ordeied.Several officials were arrested on suspicion, but the majority have been released in default of any definite proof. A fresh census of Turkisfan is to be taken. It is expected to give most surprising results especially with regard to the native population who are said under the former regime, to have consistently understated their numbers; and it is considered not unlikely that the total may approximate to nearly the double of the hitherto accepted 9 millions. Owing to difficulties with the “ militia ” performing the duties of the former police force at Askhabad, soldiers are being employed on police duties pending the reconstruction of the militia. Yomud Turkomans concerned in the late rebellion are reported to be in the greatest straits for food, berries and all available edible roots being utilised. . Ar ms having been confiscated, bands of men armed with sticks attempt to circumvent whatever game they can find. t 321. Military discipline. —Colonel Cherkes, commanding the Turkisfan Military District, publishes an order concerning delay by troops in obeving orders from higher authority. He instances a recent case in which a draft for the front remained discussing the object of the order to proceed until the train had left without them, with consequent disorganisation of traffic. The weak terms in which the order is couched produce an unfavourable impression. A notice appears in the Turkistan News giving time of departure and route through the town of Tashkent of a draft for the front from the 2nd Siberian Reserve Rifle Regiment. All citizens are called on to give the men a hearty send-off. 322. Bokhara. —Owing this year’s food shortage the Amir has remitted half of the usual taxes. 323. Russian Consular Service. —Caucasus papers reproduce an appeal from the “ Murtakion Irani ^ calling attention to the reactionary conduct of Russian consuls in Persia, and the resulting oppression of the peasantry. The society calls for a clean sweep of the existing cadre, and the appointment of officials corresponding to the spirit of a free and democratic government. 324. Frontier Guard. —At a recent meeting of the officers and soldiers, Frontier Guard Committee, the evacuation of the following posts destroyed or seriously damaged during the Yomnd rising was recommended pending repairs : Kurban Kaz. Karatasb, Tomak. Chat. Sangudag. Naarli. The evacuation of the following posts in the Pul-i-Khatun—Kushk rayon for repairs, improvement of water-supply, and forage facilities, was also consi dered desirable. • —- Sher Tapa, Akar Chashmab..

Emsfan force.—kn officer and 2 men of the 1 st Semirechia Cossacks who spent some weeks at Tiflis as regimental delegates to the representative session of the Caucasus Army have just returned. The officer gives an unfayour- ^.i e . '^port of the state of affairs, and states that 2 regiments ordered to leave Tinis in relief of units in the front line refused to proceed. Colonel Gustchin reports an improvement in the spirit of the men here who seem much encouraged by the proceedings of the Pan-Cossack Session at Petrograd. ^ A party under an officer with whom I fell in this mornin 0, displav- ed a lively interest in the latest war news and appa ently fully shared their officer s disgust at the conduct of troops in the front line on the western front 32d. Turbat f Sheikh JciYn&gt;.' m —\ had a short interview this morning with Colonel Skuratt who returned from Jam yesterday evening, and who is comin 0, later in the day to discuss matters with the Consul-General. He heard of the presence of the Ilbaigi when some distance from Jam. The latter was evidently most restless and was flitting from place to place. Before reaching Jam Colonel Skuratt received a letter from the Ilbaigi inviting him to a hunting party and enclosing ICO rubles in gold “ for his expenses. ' A more detailed letter was received later, and on arrival at Jam Colonel Skuratt wro^e to the Ilbaigi at length detailing the causes of displeasure of the Russian Government, and stat- ing that they were prepared to condone past offences in view of guarantees for the future and informing him that he could safely come in to discuss matters the following day. A relative arrived instead who dilated on the hardships of the Ilbaigi’s present position. The latter has been dissuaded by his friends from coming in person. Colonel Skuratt intimated that he would await the Ilbaigi at Jam till the following evening, when as there was no indication of his coming he left for Meshed. Just previous to his departure Shajji-as-Saltanah came to him in great distress, haying just heard that his brother Shaukat-ad-Daulah had left Meshed for Jam. He said that the Ilbaigi had assembled 300 to 400 men and would probably be able to raise as many as a thousand, ii e was in fear of a dis turbance when Afghan frontier robbers would in all probability utilise the opportunity to loot the district. Herat and Afghanistan. if j i 3 I M i b m 327. Germans and adherents .—Bayerl has purchased two horses for -Wagner. In the course of conversation he stated that they would await the conclusion of peace at Herat as they could not subject the records with which they were entrusted to the risk of capture. He apparently added that some of the party might attempt departure but it was not clear to whom he referred. Both the Naib-ul-Hukumah and the Naib Salar accepted an invitation to lunch from Kazim Beg, and Wagner also proposed to invite these dignitaries. The correct name of Purey Khan is said to be Ibrahim Khan. According to his statement he is a Yusufzai settled in India. He was * ( forced ” to go to the war and subsequently deserted to the Turks. In Herat report received on the 27th instant. Abdurrahman Khan was re ported to have left the Bagh-i-Kartah after a quarrel with Wagner, and to have taken up his quarters with Kazim Beg. Yesterday a special messenger froiq ‘1 i ! ii vHerat brought the Intelligence that he had secretly left Herat for Meshed on horse back on about the 2lth instant. The Russian cordon have been warned and a sharp look-out is being kept for him here. 328. Collection of supplies .—A further report from the agent responsible for the information noted in paragraph 314 is still awaited. At present in quiries made on the Persian side of the border do not tend to confirm his state ment. 329. Promotions and discharges .—Naib Salar on inspection of the Kotwali battalion discharged 2 captains and 3 subadars. He promoted one subadar to 2 nd in command, two others to captain, and promoted 3 men from the ranks to subadar and 5 to havildar for proficiency. He has warned the cavalry that the establishment of jamadars per squad ron will be four and that he proposes to promote the most efficient at his forthcoming inspection. 33 °- Relieti.—W cavalry savars have left Herat for relief of posts on the Balamurghab frontier. 1 i .. ^ 31- Incident.—-k free fight befVeen men of the artillery and the Wan of officers 011 8 qUestlon of P rocedenc e was narrowly averted by the intervention m 33 /- Travellers from Kabul via Hazaraiat who le't for Meshed m the middle of May report considerable activity in the vicinity of r ®f air cf t!l ® Jalalabad and Kandahar roads to keep them fif for r . * tra ® e ' Ille ‘'e was talk of the repairs to roads towards Turkistan, Kurram, Ghazni, etc., at a distance from Kabul, but although military had been detailed’ SttaTtt wZ'.^r Pr0bab ' e , tbat ,h ^ to recede bribra to report tbat the work had been carried out when little or nothing had been ,, TI&gt;e J sa ' ,, noting of any recruits on their wav from Kabul to Herat nor Russian Turkistan. “ the Supp^e^im/o^Hm^^Tt 111 ^ 0 ^ ^ ctlvlties of a voluntary society for ,o “ i ” “t? &lt;«” l .sxs News to ' Citizen tffievfs ” to r t “ ‘ S “ , advertis «n*ent in the Turkistan ing the banknotes for their troublT 8 PaSSP ° 8Ud PriTate paperS stolei1 ’ kee P' for the'front on tffiTlSth festant ! 1 a^entortainmen^t^ha ^ eg! ? lent ¥* Tashkent the previous day, and presents lavished upon ftem Befo™ 11 S f 1Ve - n - ^ were formed ud round i i pun inem. ±Jefore entraining they ihi ‘oSntSwr. \ '“' r : -(&gt;[ % J ■-■A Meshed Diary No. 22 for the week ending the 2 nd June 1917. L Persian officials. —Motamid-ul-Wizara has arrived in Meshed and taken up the post of assistant in the Revenue office. He was formerly Chief Police in Meshed, and is very popular in the town. 2. M. Kornelis has protested.to the Minister of Revenue against the issue of orders to him direct by the Treasurer-General and asks that all orders may come through his own department. 3. Our Kargumr, Muhakkik-ud-Daulah, is trying for election to the national assembly, but his prospects of success are considered to be remote. 4. M. Vercheval has been appointed Director of Customs at Kermanshah and leaves to-morrow. 5. A M. Delcorde has been appointed to succeed M. Kornelis as Director of Oustoms at Meshed. 6. Persian affairs, —With reference to paragraph 3 of Diary No. 16 an official inspection has been made of the Korans in the Shrine and the number, four, is found to be correct. 7. Tranquillity prevails on the subject of grain and bread sales (paragraph 4 last week). The community seem to have become reconciled to the rate of two krans per man for the latter. 8. Russian affairs. —The return to Meshed of another Russian subject of un-pleasant antecedents is reported, and the Russian Consulate-General are making enquiries about him. 9. The Karguzar has shown us a telegram which he has received from the Foreign Office informing him that three Austrian refugees are about to be brought to Meshed and that he should not hand them over to the Russian authorities but should send them to Tehran. The matter will be dealt with when they arrive. It hardly seems desirable to return to the former custom if it can be avoided. 10. Dabir-us-Sultan (paragraph 9 last week) has arrived in Meshed. He has brought from Askabad two advocates to assist his case against the Kuchanis. It is now intended to summon the latter and to hear the case in Meshed. 11. The chief of Bujnurd has telegraphed to the Governor-General asking for orders regarding one Austrian and two Turkish “ refugees ” who have recently been apprehended in his territory. Details are awaited and His Excellency has not yet issued instructions. 12. The Russian community is quiet and the newly elected committee seems to be perfectly harmless, but M. Nicolsky is depressed and remarked to me recently that but for the difficulty of removing his family from Meshed he would at once take the leave to which he is entitled. 13. Persian and German Intrigues. —The Karguzar has telegraphed to the Foreign Office reporting that all Persians deported to Russia as political prisoners have been released and have returned to their homes with the exception of Ahmad Agha, the late Chief of the Gendarmerie at Tun. He asks that the release of this man may also be arranged through the Russian Legation. 14. Referring to paragraph 18, the messenger Saiyid Husain has been released and allowed to return to Herat. Ahmad Barbari, and the German secret agent Abdul Wahab, being Persian subjects, will probably be sent to Tehran by the Karguzar with a strong recommendation to the Persian Government to keep them in confinement until the end of the war. 15. Some Foreign subjects—Turks and Russian Turks—having expressed a wish to join the local democrat society this question was discussed at the weekly meeting held on the 26th May. It was decided that for reasons of safety they should not be admitted.2 The coming elections were again considered on this occasion and the necessity for ensuring the election of Malik-us-Shura’ and other persons of his description, with that of opposing unpatriotic local men such Agha Kaim Mukam was pressed upon the meeting. 16. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —We are told by the Karguzar here that Nabil-ud-Daulah’s appointment as Karguzar of Meshed is assured (paragraph 1&amp; last week). , . ' . ^ .1 17. There are no further news of M. Mikhailoff. 18. A demonstration is being made at Turbat regarding the sale of revenue grain to relieve distress. It is desired that the amount now in the Government store (about 2,500 kharwars) should be sold at the same rate as at Meshed. 19. The relief of Russian Cossack posts on the Turbat-Meshed road is announced. 20. The contract for supply of barley and lucerne (at Tumans 20 per kharwar each) for six months from 1st March (Russian) has been given to Haii Amin ut Tujjar. 21. Shahzada Mujtaba Mirza has been appointed Chief Excise officer af Turbat, and has commenced work. 22. News from, Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—M. Lemansky while in Meshed (paragraph 17 last week) stayed with Nasrat-ul-Mulk : he did not call at this Consulate. Nasrat visited me on the 30th and apologised for having entertained him, saying that he insisted upon coming to his house (paragraph 16 of Diary No. 12). Colonel Scouratt remarked that he had refused to listen to any explanation from Lemansky of his recent conduct. J 23. It has been decided to allow Shaji-us-Saltanah to remain as Governor of Jam (paragraph 21 of Diary No. 20) and formal orders from the Governor-General have at length been secured. 24. Our Karez agent informs me that the Ilbaigi will not approach Colonel bcouratt when the latter visits Jam, as his confidence in the Russians has not vet been restored (paragraph 13 of Diary No. 16). J , l 5 \ y«;s/r 0 m // e rar.^The arrest of a Kakari at Ghurian for smuggling five 3-shot rifles (?) from Persia is reported : both the man and the weapons have been sent to the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who has fined the former Krans 100 for having no passport and released him on security. 8 26. A conflict is reported from Kuhsan to have occurred between the escort of a caravan smuggling wool to Persia and some frontier sowars. The latter were not strong enough to stop the caravan, which proceeded on its way. 27.

Amin-i-Hamayun has left for Tehran on the completion of his enquiry into Shrine affairs (paragraph 5 of Diary No. 20). 3. Ala-us-Saltanah has telegraphed to the Karguzar announcing his appoint- ment as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. 4. Some prominent persons have telegraphed, to Tehran asking for the rerappointment of Shahzada Naiyur-ud-Daulah as Governor-General of Khorasan. 5. Agha Muayid-ul-Wizara, the late Karguzar of Tun, Tabas, etc., who was deported to Russia 16 months ago has, on release and return to Persia, been re-appointed to his former post. 6. Persian affairs. —M. Kornelis called upon me on the 5th instant to discuss the grain question. He objects to be directed to sell the Government grain at Tumans 15 per kharwar while private owners are allowed to sell for what they can get provided that the bread rate does not rise above 2 krans per man. The Governor-General is protesting against the direct sale from the Revenue office to the public according to a recent order of the Home Secretary, as he loses his profit by the discontinuance of the system whereby it was sold through him. The matter is still under discussion : the zeal of M. Kornelis for Government interests is shared by no section of the community and he is meeting with considerable opposition. 7. Two persons arrested for complicity in the murder of the late Rais-i- Nazmiah have been deported from Meshed by the Governor-General. 8. British affairs. —The Birthday of His Majesty the King-Emperor was celebrated on the 4th instant by a garden party and illuminations. The former was attended by His Excellency the Governor-General, the Karguzar and all principal officials, and the Russian Consul-General and Military Commanding Officer with their staffs, etc. On 5th instant representatives of the mercantile community were entertained at a similar party, and care was taken on both occasions to remove any false impression which might have been caused by the rumour of a revolution in the United Kingdom (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 20). 9. Messrs. Donaldson and Hoffman of the American Presbyterian Mission proceeded to Jaghark on the 6th instant to inspect the (private) summer residence of this Consulate which I have lent them for this season. They found the house in possession of a band of ten Zushkis who had taken sanctuary on our premises against the oppression of the Chief Muhammad Zabirullah. The interview which followed was cordial, but I have complained officially to the Governor-General and am sending an official to Jaghark to enquire. 10. Russian affairs. —The Kuchanis have received a re-assuring telegram from the Home Secretary in reply to their complaints regarding export of grain to Russia. 11. It is reported from Sarakhs that the local Russian community have held a ceremonial gathering in honour of the new regime in Russia. The Governor, Karguzar, and other officials of Persian Sarakhs, were invited to attend. 12. Meshhedi Abdullah, the local Russian Tajir-hashi, is in trouble with the Askabad authorities. He promised them 5,000 khanvars of grain and is now unable to fulfill his contract owing to a purchase which he was on the point of making having been prevented by order of the Persian Government. 13. Dabir-us-Sultan (paragraph 10, last week) has not succeeded in obtaining a verdict in his land dispute with the Kuchanis j M. Nicolsky and the Kargzuar having declined to re-open it. 2 il c I ;.E i;; — 1 INDIA F, .'i-IGN SECDET': Letter, Dated Bacei No. 54 M 13 JUL 1917 f : ji 7.1 m' IB 1917 AIll f ! f 'l iii; V : i i f I III? i1ii I'fi! ! ■ li t'fi | u' ill m! I 2 14. Persian-and German Intrigues. —In accordance with instructions received from His Majesty’s Minister the German secret agent, Abd-ul-Wahab, was delivered to the Governor-General for despatch to Sistan. His Excellency, who, considering the actual condition of affairs at Tehran, shewed commendable resolution and promptitude, forwarded him the same day to Birjand under a suitable escort. It is hoped that he will be detained there under close observation until the end of the war Ahmad Barbari, the German messenger, was despatched to Sistan on the 6th conveyed by Russians, this course having been approved by the local authorities- 5 who did not desire that he also should be handed over to them. His Majesty’s Consul in Sistan has been informed of these dispositions, in regard to which time - w r as of importance. 15. At a meeting of democrats held on the 5th instant it was stated that the Germans w r ere on the point of attacking Petrograd in great force. Disappointment was expressed at the entry of Brazil into the war, which, it was said, v T ould largely affect German prospects at sea. Later, the Governor-General’s uselessness was referred to, and it was decided once more to agitate for his removal in favour of some person who should not be selected by the Russians and English. Bitter feeling against M. Kornelis (paragraph 6 above) exists among the democratic party, chiefly, it seems, because they consider that a Persian should have been appointed to the Revenue Commissionership. 16. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Mikhailoff is reported to be making trouble between Antipoff, the new Vice-Consul, and the local commandant of Russian troops. Antipoff asked him formally on the 27th ultimo why he did not leave the place, and he replied that he was waiting for money. 17. The attempted suicide of a Russian Cossack on account of some private trouble is reported. . ^ * 18. M. Kornelis has telegraphed toRhe Revenue office at Turbat to-sell the Government grain at a suitable rate without delay (paragraph 18 last week). 19. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—The Officer recently in command of tUe Russian troops at Jam has arrived in Meshed and called on me. He spoke strongly of Lemansky’s conduct wdiile there, and of the extent to which he had fleeced the local people. 20. Shaji-us-Saltanah has received the definite orders of Government appoint ing him to the post of Governor and it is hoped that the intrigues against him will now cease. 21. News from The local revenue officer has returned from Meshed. 22. News from Herat.— to shortage of water the Naib-ul-Hukumah\^ ordered the hours at which certain mills are worked to be curtailed. 23. Certain Turkoman emigrants requested permission [from the Naib-ul- Hukumah to proceed to Russian Jurkistan to bring members of their families who v ished to join them. The Naib declined to allow this, being apparently suspicious of the petitioners’ motives. 24. Bayerl visited Saiyid Riza in prison (paragraph 27 of Diary No. 21), apparently against the wishes of the jailor, who reported his conduct. 25. A Persian who stated that he was the bearer of a letter from the Germans at Herat was anested at Kafir Killah and sent in to Kuhsan and thence to Herat. His name is Ghulam Riza Tehrani and he is said to have passed through Karez disguised as a muleteer. It seems that he came to Herat about three months ago with a letter and returned to Meshed. Probably he is Abd-ur-Rahman’s nephew (paragraph 24 of Diary No. 21). Wagner is said not to have been pleased with the news he brought and to have been very angry at his identity having been discovered. 26. Wagner visited the Naib Solar on the 29th ultimo and remained with him for about two hours. He is reported to have told him that peace was about to be concluded with Russia, after which they would have no difficulty in defeating the Erench and English. ,’ - ^ : is ^ k 01 -», “%! °»l*lk wiitmt ia %«i t oi Ids® not leave | COlMlliit . He fob iieli teM i ^ d : ur ' Raliman (P ara grapli 31 last week) has promised to effect the release of Saiyid Riza from prison. 28 Captain Muhsin Khan (paragraph 10 of Diary Ko. 19) has returned to Herat from Meshed, and the 'Naib-ul-Hukumah and Naib Solar have received with interest and satisfaction the news which he brought them. They are now making !w U1 ^ eS ^ egarding tlle P eo P le w ^° spread false news, and are said to have heard tnat the German party are the source from which it comes. 29. Kazim Beg complained to the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 31st ultimo of the accommodation given to his horses during the day. The Naib remarked that his horses were in the same place, which was good enough for them. 30. General Khorassan news.—The head of the road guards at Turuk, having arrested two thieves, delivered them to his Naib, one Faiz Muhammad, for deten tion. The Naib, finding that one of the thieves had money, caused him to be murdered during the night and the corpse thrown down a well. Next day. he reported that one of the thieves had escaped, but subsequently the corpse was found and the crime came to light. 31. Bequests to be allowed to purchase Government stores of grain are reported fr° m various localities. 32. The Governor-General has sent Shahzada Amjad-ul-Mulk to Shirwan to demarcate the Kuchan-Shirwan boundary and to enquire into the disputes between the Chief of Bujnurd and Shuja-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan. It is reported since his departure, however, that the Chief, tired of the incessant disputes and trouble, has recommended that Shirwan may be returned to Kuchan. The local authorities seem to think that the establishment of a separate Government of Shirwan and Bajgiran (paragraph 35 last week) would be the arrangement most likely to secure peace for the future. Meshed : The 9th June 1917.\ O.OUA.df' CONFIDENim. Meshed Diary No. 2^/for the week ending the 23rd June 1917. 1. Persian officials .—M. Delcorde, M. Kornelis’ successor as Provincial director of Customs, has arrived in Meshed with his family. He has assumed charge of the office. 2. Persian affairs {local). —The birthday and coronation of His Maiesty the bhah were celebrated on Monday, 18th instant. The usual official visits were paid m the morning and a state banquet was held in the evening at which the toasts of His Majesty the Shah, the Provisional Russian Government, His Maiesty vmg George V, and the Royal Family of Persia were drunk. This was followed by a display of fire works. • . The Meshed poor-house (paragraph 6 of Diary No. 8) was opened on the 19th instant. There are at,present about fifty inmates only owing to lack of accom modation, but it is hoped that large premises will shortly be acquired. 4. The fasting month of Ramazan having commenced only urgent work receives attention at the various offices, and local quarrels and intrigues are said to be m abeyance. 5. The question of the sale of this year’s Government grain is now under discussion (paragraph 5 last week).' A general application, supported by the Governor-General, has been made to Government for its sale at Tumans 15, the rate at which the Maliyah are selling the grain of last year. d. M. Kornelis has changed the system of the Maliyah gendarmerie. They are henceforth to assume a more definitely civil status ; are to attend no drills or parades; and the title of gendarmerie is to be changed to that of Maliyah sowars. , 7. Persian affairs (genera/),—Shahzada Amjad-ul-Mulk (paragraph 32 of Diary No. 23) has telegraphed to the Governor-General that he finds the people of Shirwan well contented with the authority of the Chief of Bujnurd. They tell him that the Kuchan Government is alone to blame for the disturbances that have occurred. The Chief’s Naib-ul-HukumaJi of Shirwan succeeded during the past week in besieging the robber Khuddu and his gang in the village of Fartan, and killed or arrested eight of them. Khuddu himself has again escaped, and is being pursued. 8. The inhabitants of Chinaran have also telegraphed denying the accusation that they were dissatisfied with their Governor. 9. Russian affairs .—Colonel Scouratt, Russian Staff Officer, left on 19th for Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and Karez. It is said that he had received information of the collection by Ilbaigi Kaudani of 300 armed men for the express purpose of taking revenge upon the Russian detachment of troops at Jam. This is an incorrect report, but Colonel Scouratt’s arrival may be timely {vide “ News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam” below). 10. A disturbance, in which the Russian agent (paragraph 14 of Diary No. 2) is implicated, is reported by telegram from Darajez both by him and by representa tives of the other party. He accuses the Governor of Darajez, Riza Khan (paragraph 20 of Diary No. 9), of an intention to attack him and other Russian subjects and proteges ; while his opponents charge him with interference in internal affairs which do not concern hum. Telegrams have been sent by the Governor- General and the Russian Consul-General ordering the peace to be kept and each party to desist from irregular conduct. It is generally believed that the Russian agent is at fault. 11. News from Turbat-i-Haidari .—M. Mikhaiioff is still awaiting developments. 12. The safe passage of the prisoners Abd-ul-Wahab and Ahmad Barbari through Turbat en route for Sistan is reported (paragraph 14 of Diary No. 23). 1 Li !• br 11/13. M. Antipoff, the Russian Vice-Consul, having complained against the local Commandant of Russian troops (paragraph 16 of. Diary No. 23) for not supplyina him with an escort, the Commandant has been recalled to Meshed. 14. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —It seems that the intrigues against Shaji-us-Saltanah (paragraph 20 of Diary No. 23) in favour of his dissolute brother v Shaukat-ud-Daulah have not yet ceased. The Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan, acting under instructions from some evil-disposed persons in Meshed are said to have collected 300 armed men in the neighbourhood of Jam for the purpose of forcibly ejecting Shaji as soon as Shaukat appears on the scene. He is at present in Meshed, and the Governor-General, who is convinced of Shaji’s superior qualifica tions for the post of Governor, has caused him to give an undertaking that he will not leave the city until further orders ; and it is proposed to call Shaji to Meshed with the object of reconciling the,brothers, and making some settlement which will be satisfactory to both and baffle the intriguers. ) Meanwhile Colonel Scouratt has gone to Jam and it is probable that his presence there will give the Ilbaigi something else to think about. 15. News from Karez. —Our agent has enquired at Taiyabad regarding Mustafa, the supposed father-in-law of the German messenger Ghulam Riza, but failed to trace him. 16. Neivs from Herat—kizozni number of the Siraj-ul-Akhhar of Kabul contained an article headed “ Baghdad ” which concludes with these words : ‘ “ We must not omit to point out that Baghdad, like Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, is among the Holy Places of Islam in which all the Islam world has a share. Mussalmans everywhere should realise that were these sacred spots to fall into Christian hands (which may God neither permit nor decree !) it would be a loss to all Muslims and not only to the Turks. The responsibility then would be a general rather than a particular one, and this being so the recapture of such places is a duty incumbent upon all Muslims. History gives an excellent example in the agreement of the Muslim world to retake Jerusalem from the Crusaders.” A report having been received of the transport of 600 camel-loads of grain from the interior of Afghanistan to the frontier near Zulfikar, enquiries are *being made on the subject by our agent at Herat and also through the Taimuri Chief, Nasrat-ul-Mulk, who has a representative at Zurabad near Zulfikar. The amount is large for an ordinary consignment, and it is suspected that the provisionment of special troops may be the object of its despatch. 17. A report from Kara Tippah states that a number of Russian-Turkomans ha\ e been refused permission to enter Afghan territory on the ground that hunger alone had prompted them to emigrate. There is much distress in Russian Turkistan on account of famine. 18. The Governor of Shahrak (a nephew of Shuja-ul-Mulk of Bakhurz) has been recalled and imprisoned for misconduct. 19. One Habib-ullah, a Baluch Chief, has returned with 22 families from Russian territory, to which he had emigrated. The Naib-ul-Hukumahh&amp;s ordered that security be taken from him to prevent the party again leaving the country. 20. The inhabitants of Ghurian, Killa Nau, and Baclghist having represented to the Naib-ul-Hukumah their inabihty to pay in revenue grain owing to scarcity, he has sent Inspectors' to make enquiries. 21. \V anger is said to have given orders to his servants to speak of his residence as the Consulate and no longer to refer to it as Bagh-i-Kertah. 22. The arrival in Herat of a Turkish resident of Baghdad is reported. He had escaped from confinement in Russia after eleven months’ detention as a prisoner of war (see paragraph 28 last week). 23. Bayerl has at length succeeded in selling a horse in the bazar for Tumans 80. Abd-ur-Rahman has also disposed of his for Tumans 45.1. Persian officials. —The locality of Gunabad has again been added to the 'Government of Tabas and placed under the Governor, Salar Arfa.. 2. The death of Ashja’ Mzam, head of the Karai troop of sowars at Turbat, has occurred. Salar Nusrat (paragraph 1 of Diary No. 20) and Mustafa Kuli Khan, father of the deceased, are mentioned as candidates for the post, 3. Finding that nothing had been done to secure the arrest and punishment of Ibrahimzada (paragraph 7 of Diary No. 20) and Ismail (paragraph I of Diary No, 19) for complicity in the murder of the late Rais-i-Nazmiah, and hearing that these jpersons are outlaws at Tabat Khan in the neighbourhood of Meshed, I have urged upon the Governor-General the advisability of sending a force to take them, suggesting the Barbari party, which recently dealt successfully with a gang of rShikari robbers. M. Nicolsky has promised to support the suggestion, but tlm Governor-General has not yet adopted at, though he apparently intends to take ■ early steps of some kind. 4. Persian affairs (local). —The expeditionary force sent out to deal with the 'Zushki robbers (paragraph 30 of Diary No. 21) has returned to Meshed bringing 12 mf the Zushkis, whom it is intended to enlist in the Persian Cossack brigade- The leader of this gang, Muhammad Zabih-ullah, on payment of the fine levied upon him has been appointed Governor of the hill district of Koh Paijat, that in which -Jaghark is situated. Our official (paragraph 9 last week) has reported from Jaghark that the men who had taken sanctuary in our house are from the neighbouring village of Kang, and that their protest was against the appointment of the Zushki just referred to- ‘They have left our house, which does not seem to have suffered from their occupa tion. 5 . The grain and bread question has not yet been settled satisfactorily from the point of view of M. Kornelis, but the democrats have come to see his point of view and have recently expressed appreciation of him ; so that prospects are Brighter. 6. Persian affairs (general). —Oppression of the people on the part of Excise and Revenue officials is reported from Sabsawar. \ 7. Much distress exists at Sarakhs where numbers of agriculturists have been obliged to dispose of their cattle owing to the absence of fodder, and others have left the place for Khakistar in search of grazing. Assistance has been promised ,by the local officials. 8.. A case of house-breaking is reported from the village of Barrud near Sar- kabah, but prompt action resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of part of the- robber gang. Among them is Zawar Ali, the Barbari mentioned in paragraph 9 of Diary No. 10. :9. Haidar Ardanji, the Kuchani robber mentioned in paragraph 23 of Diary No. 15, was hanged in Meshed on the 12th instant. 10. British affairs. —Orders for goods have been placed by local merchants with firms in India during the past few days to the amount of two lakhs of rupees. The prospects of a revival of Meshed trade with India are causing anxiety in Russian commercial circles. M. Kal, Secretary of the Russian Consulate-General, en quired on the 14th instant from one of his nationals whether it was true that the British Government had undertaken to defray half the freight on goods transported to Khorassan by the Nushki trade route,2 11. The Governor-General recently remarked to our Attache that the Russian Government being now defunct his only hope was in ourselves. He was told in reply that we would do our best for him. 12. Recruiting for various regiments from the Barbari community is proceed ing very satisfactorily. 13. Russian affairs. —M. Nicolsky’s position as Consul-General is a most unpleasant one in the present circumstances (paragraphs of Diary No. 22). He complained bitterly to, me on the 15th instant of Colonel Scouratt’s recent action in arresting and putting to considerable inconvenience four harmless Sart travellers on suspicion of being Tartar deserters ; saying that an official complaint from these persons might result in his recall. It is suspected that Mikhailoff has. some idea of being appointed Consul-General at Meshed, and that it is on that account that he remains at Turbat-i-Haidari. 14. The Russian subject mentioned in paragraph &amp; of Diary No. 22 has been engaged by the Rais-i-Nazmiah as his private servant. The Governor-General explains that the man being a scoundrel will be useful in arresting persons of similar character, and that he will himself be prevented from misconduct by being under the eye of the police.. M. Nicolsky is powerless now in regard to these bad characters. 15. M. Nieolsky is also in trouble regarding the case of Dabir-us-Sultan and- the Kuchanis. It seems that the Dabir paid-his advocates 17,00Q roubles for their case (paragraph 10 of Diary No. 22) but they were informed by the Karguzar upon arrival here that under the provisions of the Turkomanchah treaty they had no right to appear, and a reference to M. Nicolsky produced no effect as he had himself prompted the Karguzar to give them this information. They arc all much displeased, and the advocates talk of reporting Nicolsky' to various committees. 16.. Meshedi Abdullah (paragraph 12 last week) is still detained at Askabad- by the Ibeaf committee, who clhim from him 110,000 tumans. An order for his liberation, which arrived from Petrograd, has been flatly disregarded by the com mittee.. 17. It seems that grain is being secretly exported to Russian territory in exchange for sugar.. 18. The three persons mentioned' in paragraph 9 of Diary No. 22 have been, despatcheddo Tehran under orders from thence. They seem to be escaped Austrian prisoners., 19. Persian and German Intrigues. —Much satisfaction is expressed in locaT democratic circles at the position held by Mustaufi-ul-Mumalik in the new cabinet. It was stated in the weekly meeting that large purchases of arms were being made in Tehran by democrats at tumans 14 per rifle and tumans 3 per 100 cartridges. 20. The Governor-General informs us of the arrival at Meshed of seven persons sent by the Central Democrat Committee at Tehran, to watch the elections here, and that they have been directed to murder if necessary any person taking a prominent part against their schemes for the election of suitable candidates. 21. Haji Muhammad Jafir (paragraph 12 of Diary No. 21) remarked with satisfaction to our Attache recently that whereas the former Russian Government had arrested and deported democrats th6 new administration were sending orders to their representatives in Persia to help and support them. 22. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —M._ Mikhailoff still shows no sign of leaving Turbat. ' 6 Jj 23. News from He/rat:—-Some rain and a flood are reported from Herat with af resulting decrease in the prices of various necessities of lifer 24. The imprisonment of a Jamshidi on suspicion of being a Russian spy has' been ordered by the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 25. Permission has not yet been granted for the Turkoman chief Kurbam Muhammad to return to his home (paragraph 19 of Diary No..21).&lt;3;M.Pi^ss, Simla.—No,.C. 205 I\D.—17-7-17—30 —M.B.Gj 26. ^ It having been reported to the Naib-ul-Hulcumali that Russian subieetig were bringing quantities of sugar to the frontier near Chihil Dukhtaran to exchange or wheat, he has ordered that they should be told that while there is no objection to the sale of the sugar its exchange for wheat cannot at present bo allowed on account of local scarcity, 27. Abd-ur-Rahman (paragraph 27 last week) is reported to have purchased on the 2nd instant two text books of Sunni doctrines. He apparently contemplates a change of belief. 5 An elclerl - y esca P ed - Turkish prisoner has been brought in to Herat from Bala Murghab. The Naib-ul-Hukumah after a private interview with him sent him to Kazim Beg to be. looked after. Tkh instant the Mehmandar of the Bagb-i-Kertah found fault with the Captain of the guard for allowing Abd-ur Rahman to visit the town insufficiently escorted, and reminded him that this person should always be accompanied by two or three selected persons whenever he went to town. 30. On 5th instant Wagner’s servant Nasrullah purchased a 500-rouble note in the town and announced his intention of making further purchases. 31. Ghulam Riza (paragraph 25 last week) became ill while en route to Herat from Meshed, and stayed for some time in the house of his father-in-law, one Mustafa of Taiyabad near Rarez. Our agent there has been asked to make enquiries* regarding this Mustafa, v 32. It is reported that amicable relations between Whgner and Bayerl are restored, but that the respect of the former for Abd-ur-Rahman is decreasing owing to a desire on the part of the Persian to make himself out to be as good a man as the other. 1 ■ , 33. On the 8th the Austrian known as “ Mirza ” visited Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat-ullah and informed them of the receipt by Wagner of a cheque for a large sum from Meshed which he wished to cash on the Naib Salar.- Barkat- ullah enquired the name of the person by whom the cheque was payable, but this Mirza could not tell him.

They are said to have taken the Governor Sardar Gul Muhammad Khan in a balloon at night to the Chakhansur Fort, where they found the Sad Bashi and all his men asleep. They abstracted the Sad Bashi’s rifle without waking anyone and returned to Kala Kang! On the 10 th June the two Germans ” went under an escort to Chahar Burjak. (2) It is said that there are two other “ Germans ” at Lash Juwain. (3) Two reports have also reached Kacha : (a) that two strangers dressed as pilgrims and talking a foreign tongue are in Chahar Burjak; and (6) that two strangers with fair complexions but talking Persian are in Bandar Kamal Khan. Both these parties are probably identical with that mentioned under (1) above.* (4) Eleven “ Germans ” are said to have recently reached Kandahar from Kabul. News from Afghanistan. (1) See last week’s diary. I hear that the punitive action taken by the Governor of Kandahar against some of his subordinates is on account of the latter having countenanced the crimes of Bahim Khan, son of Alam Khan Rakhshani of Shorawak. The last-named is an outlaw from Nushki, but his last exploit was the raiding of an Afghan caravan owned by a trader of Farah named Gul, in which affair a camel-man was also murdered. (2) The Baluchis of Shorawak are said to be in a mutinous state. (3) A notorious robber named Muhammed Akbar of Jud is said to have been executed at Kandahar. (4) The troops between Kandahar and Girishk are being rearmed with a German (?) rifle. (5) Grain is so scarce in Chakhansur—or perhaps more probably the authorities have so effectively collected all the stocks— that it^ has been found necessary to open three State shops for the sale under supervision of wheat to the public.

His case is still under investigation Indian Suspects. T.T „6) A man calling himself Hakim Sahibzada Muhammad Hassan son of • U a a . Abd f u Kuddus , of Khan Mai TaM Charsada, Peshawar district, has arrived Sistan from Ghakhansur with his Sistani wife and some small children He is known by many people of Sistan as having been in the Medical Service of the Afghan Government for several years. He was arrested in Mian Kangi and made over to me by the Persian authorities. He tells me that he used 8 to receive a salary of Brans 400 per mensem as Medical Officer with the Chakhansur troops and Kians 400 in addition as a secret news-reporter directly corresponding with Kabul. The Governor of Kala Kang recently discovered that he was reporting matters to his discredit, and he was warned that he was about to be arrested as th w fiAJ' A® tI l eref ° re fled Precipitately. I have asked the Government of the North-West Frontier Province for information about the man. (2) I recently received a report from Afghanistan that an Indian fakir had reached Jali Eobat and was being tortured by the Afghans because he would not speak. On a reference to Koh Malik Siah, I am informed that a silent fakir who had arrived from Mekran via Gwarkoh and Duzdab wearing Baluchi clothes had been arrested by the British Thanedar at Bobat and sent to Kacha. The man has not entered Afghanistan nor been tortured, but he has numerous old scars on his arms and neck. News from Kainat. (1) The father of our news-writer at Duroh has been shot dead at night. He and his son for many years have been at enmity with a considerable faction of their village, which unfortunately Shaukat-ul-Mulk has always supported. The matter is being investigated. (2) A small conflict has occurred between Afghan and Persian sowars on the border near Awaz, in which an Afghan was killed, a Persian was carried away prisoner and two flocks of sheep were also lifted by the Afghans. It is believed that the Afghans are determined to encroach over the border. (3) It is said that Hisam-ud-Dauleh has recently sent a letter to Mir Jehind of Sarhad by the hand—as far as Sistan—of Haji Amir Khan, brother of Sirdar Khudadad Khan.• News from Afghanistan. (1) Abdus Samad Khan, the Afghan Karguzar who so frequently visits Sistan, and three Afghan FaWs (pseM&lt;fo-Parliamentary representatives) of Chakhan- sur have been peremptorily summoned to Kabul. [It is said that they will have to go now, though for some time past they have been trying to evade doing so. The ostensible cause of their summons, as popularly believed, is to explain why the district is so much in arrears with its land revenue. (2) The Governor of Lash Juwain has reported to Kabul that 400 families have migrated to Sistan from his district on account of the high price of grain. The Customs Department in Sistan. (1) The Customs Director informs me that he is endeavouring to prevent the export of arms to Chakhansur. He recently confiscated 9 rifles and fined the smuggler 350 Tomans. (2) During the last fortnight 600 camel loads of trade goods from India have been cleared and despatched from the Customs House at Koh Malik Siah, which is now empty. F. B. PIUDEAUX, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain.2 men’s and Soldiers’ Committees, they are unable to perform the duties laid upon them, and they request to be relieved of their responsibilities. II. Dorrer, the Commissary performing the duties of the Governor of Transcaspia, is having similar difficulties with Askhabad Committees and his early resignation seems not improbable. This cannot be called a hopeful augury for the future as these temporary officials presumably represent the most enlightened and moderate element called to the direction of affairs by the change of conditions in Russia. The outlook as regards supplies is bad in Ferghana, Syr Darya, and Trans caspia, particularly as regards wheat. The Workmen’s Committee at Andijan recently asserted that famine practically exists at present in Ferghana, the very small allowance of bread permitted being frequently unobtainable. They added that signs of famine riots in the future were not wanting, and requested that regular supply trains be sent. It is now stated that sufficient grain exists in Semirechia to supply other provinces, but the question of its transport remains the chief difficulty. The permanent wav of the Arys-Vyerni railway has been made as r 'ar as Pishpek but for the last 350 versts the track has not been completed owing to lack of rails. It is now variously proposed to supply these rails by dismantling many sidings on the C. A. and Tashkent railways, the extension from Bezmen towards Firiyusa being included, or to utilise the rails of the Bokharan Kaghan-Termez railway for the purpose. Adherents to the latter proposal maintain that the cotton conveyed by this line is less important to Russia than the Semirechia grain, that the line has no great strategical importance at the present time as regards Afghanistan as the English will prevent the Afghans from undertaking hostilities, and that in any case it cannot be considered as a practical strategical line, being vulnerable at several points to artillery fire from the Afghan bank of the \ Oxcs. Although probably less disorganised than in European Russia, both the C. A. and Tashkent railways present great difficulties to travellers at present. Trains are greatly overcrowded, natives and others swarming in to carriages of all classes without regard to tickets held. Steps are to be taken to depute com- ! missaries at various points to prevent the disorder which prevails along the lines. 274. Prisoners of war.-^The war prisoners employed on the C. A. line are reported to be displaying signs of insubordination, and in some cases to have refused to work. Orders have oeen given that any recalcitrant prisoners are to be returned to the prisoners camps and to be treated with the greatest severity but with a view to securing continuous work only ring-leaders or flagrant offenders are to be taken from their tasks on the railways. 275 . Military labour.—Categorical orders have been received from the General Staff that natives conscripted for work in rear of the armies are to be returned to their homes at once, and that the measures for arresting deserters are to be discontinued. The Turkistan Agricultural Society protests against the order on the grounds of shortage of food in Turkistan, want of Agricultural abour in Russia, and the sufficiency of such labour for the present in Turkistan. In any case the disorganisation of railway traffic is expected to retard the re patriation considerably. 276 . Semirechia.— Apart from the grain question conditions are not good in Semirechia. In addition to losses in last year's disorders many sheep are dying from drought. The Kirghiz are said to be acting generously with regard to returning^ Russian settlers assisting them to re-stock their farms and in some cases disclaiming payment till the end of the war. 50 per cent of rebellious Kirghiz, after return from their flight to Chinese territory are said to have died from hunger. 277 . Bokhara. According to the statement of the “young Bokharan” party peace is only ensured by the presence of the Russian troops at Bokhara, and they assert that as soon as these are withdrawn repressive measures will be 278 .

Russian intelligence.-^ air of Birjand appears to exercise a pecuharly stimulating effect on the imagination of Russian Vice-Consular •officers M. Bravine produced quite a number of sensational reports and M. Bulatov is following ip his footsteps. He has just reported to the Military Agent on the authority of English scouts” the arrival at Herat from Kabul of 15,000 Afghan troops with 18 guns. It is possible that the recruits from Kabul reported to be en route for Herat are responsible for this rumour, but up to the present no reliable confir mation of these recruits departure has reached us. An 2 ? 2 n The.three Indian deserters noted in paragraph 220 and Ahmad Barban, Wagners intercepted messenger, were despatched to Biriand on the oth instant under Russian esco.t. J 283 Gutgan force The garrison of Gunbad-i-Kabus has addressed a telegram to the commander of the force requesting the early issue of military ’ rewards for the late operations, ' particularly in view of the fact that 0 General IMadritov has already conferred the medal 'for Devotion ” on one of the princi- pal rebellious Turkoman khans. r Herat and Afghanistan. 284 Germans arid adherents.—Waguer has received a letter from Persia brought by one Ghulam Raza of Tehran, who passed Kariz disguised as a muleteer with a caravan. He apparently contemplates using him as a messenger on the return journey. Bayerl forced his way into the Herat prison to visit his servant Said Raza, who accompanied him on his late abortive journey towards the Sistan frontier, and who had been imprisoned by Wagner’s orders. 285. Reliefs. ^5 cavalry sowars have left Herat for the relief of posts on the Anardarrah frontier, and 60 for posts near Gulran. m -k 2 ! 6 ; Promotions.—hitex inspection of the Jadidi Herat! battalion by the iNaib baiar 2 havildars were promoted to subadar, and some 12 sepoys to non commissioned rank. 0 , .

This may have some connection with the reputed intention to raise a third cavalry regiment; on the other hand the number of horses required by the Herat authorities last year was never completed, and their plans to secure transport mules locally fell to the ground. - . . sIIISqsb k. - ' - ! .IKS It Oul^cI '• ■ &lt;£ t lUd r bb. 4 54 13 JUL 1917 16 AUG I9J7 If h , f ,, ' If | | .» 1 if fllk Bl!: i L [IS If Mi i '' if 1 ' iiii 288 attitude.— A hhough the condition of affairsjn Russia is being freely discussed and it is probable that exaggerated rumours are prevalent, no great excitement appears to have been caused by these events either in Herat, or according to arrivals here, in Turkistan. Beyond increased attention to the drill and training of the troops in Turkistan no military measures of any importance have been reported. Russian Turkistan. 289. Current affairs. —A telegram from Prince Lvov was received on the 27th May by the Turkistan Committee confirming the full powers conferred on them and requesting them to continue in exercise of their functions. In spite of this M. Stchepkin telegraphed begging to be relieved of his responsibilities on the ground of ilhhealth. At a meeting at Tashkent of the Socialist Revolutionary party resolutions demanding the autonomy of Turkistan were passed. The proposal to dismantle the Bokharan railway, as may be expected, has met with considerable opposition, and the strateg cal and economical importance of the line is insisted on. The abstention of the Afghans from joining in the war is ascribed, not to “ English notes, ” but to the completion of the line last year coupled with Russian successes in Persia. A delegate of the Supply Committee to the Volga wheat rayon reports favourably on the chances of obtaining supplies asked for in spite of tfu fact that a barge carrying 2,500 tons (sic) of wheat destined for Turkistan was accidently lost. A famine meeting of several thousands of the poorer class was held at Tashkent and 4 delegates were appointed to the Supplies Commission with a view to catering for the immediate needs of the more indigent. It was stated that several deaths from hunger had actually occurred in the native portion of Tashkent, but difficuhy in verifying the facts was experienced. ^ Native arrivals at Meshed report great difficulty in buying food both in Turkistan and Trans- caspia and families are being already removed to Persia on this account. Robberies at Tashkent are of daily occurrence and are on the increase. The detective department admit their inability to cope with the numerous criminal element which they state has lately gravitated to the city, and state that the only means to secure safety of life and property is recourse to the criminal “ drives ” and deportations formerly practised at regular intervals. 290. Drafts. —Drafts which recently left Askhabnd and Kushk for the Caucasus front are reported to have displayed considerable enthusiasm and martial spirit. 291. Frontier appointment. —Lieutenant A. Solomon of the Turkoman Cavalry Regiment has been appointed Commissioner for the Russo-Persian frontier. 292. Bokhara. —The lc young-Bokharan ” revolutionary party has addressed a telegram to Tashkent Workmens and Soldiers Committee stating that the Bokharan cabinet has been constituted of ministers of known reactionary ten dencies, and that under the circumstances any measures of public reform are foredoomed to failure. 293. Turkomans. —An article in the Turkistan Courier, reproduced in other papers, and entitled “ Turkoman demands,” is characterised by Colonel Khan Yomudski and the Turkoman Executive Committee as an attempt to sow dissension between the Turkoman and Russian population. The 14 demands ” include the restoration of the major part of the Imperial domain, and other agricultural and oilbearing lands to the Turkomans, with drastic changes in water distribution in favour of the Turkomans. The Committee deny the alleged claims, but state that the water question has long been in need of revision. E, A. F. REDL, LL-Colonel, G* 5.

Russian force. —Owing to forage and water difficulties Colonel Gustchin is considering the advisability of the recall of the 4 Cossack posts on the road between Meshed and Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. 295. Punitive expedition. —JalaPi-Nizam with his men has returned to Meshed bringing with him ten Zushki hostages who, in the meantime, have been set to drill with the Persian savors here. Muhammad Zahibullah Zushki is reported to be lying sick in the hills. Apparently only distrust in the good faith of the Persian authorities prevents him from availing himself of the preferred amnesty. 296. CWtfrtfY—Rumour mongers are again active in the city. They announce the re-capture of Baghdad and Kirmanshah by the Turks. 297. Democrats. —The hands of the democrats are considerably strength ened by reports of events in Tehran and Tabriz. Several members of the Kumita-i-Mujazat or Committee of Punishment have arrived and a programme of reform not unaccompanied by personal violence is outlined. Among other measures is said to be the replacement of the Persian Cossack Brigade by Gendarmerie under Swedish officers. Herat and Afghanistan. 29S. Germans and adherents. —Both Wagner and Kazim Beg have been making enquiries as to the rates of exchange of English gold and Russian rub ! e notes. Nasrullah, Wagner’s confidential servant, has purchased one 500 ruble note and was on the look out for others. Apparently they had not yet heard of the miscarriage of their messengers to Meshed, which make some difference to their reputed plan for escape ' through Russia. The search for Russian currency lends colour to the probability of the latter, and the attention of the Russians has again been directed to the necessity of the observation of the frontier and railways. A reconciliation appears to have taken place between Wagner and Bayerl. The arrival of an old man, either a Turk or a Persian who had served with the Turks, and apparently a fugitive, is reported. He has been quartered with Kazim Beg. The Naib Salar has dismissed a cavalry dafadar for speaking vehemently and disrespectfully regarding the infidel guests”. The dafadar, whose horse died in consequence of galloping after the German party when taking horse exercise, appears to have had some justification for his indignation, especially when it is remembered that the escape of Paschen occurred under very similar circum stances. 299. Cavalry. —An inspection of the cavalry arms resulted in the discovery of the deficiency of several carbines and swords. These were said to have been lost as far back as the Jamshadi affair in 1908*09. The Naib Salar directed that a fine of 1,000 krans be deducted from the pay of the officers of the Chaharyari regiment and 16,000 krans from that of the officers of the Turki regiment. The latter were more severely punished for having failed to report the deficiency to the officer commanding the regiment. 300. Taimanis.—'l'at Naib Salar has posted the Taimani recruits who have completed their drills to the Khaki and Ghaznichi infantry battalions. As these men were specially enlisted for the Sappers and Miners this action would appear to indicate a shortage of infantry recruits. 301.

Kandahar. —Arrivals at Meshed from Kandahar state that some months ago 80 camel loads of ammunition reached Kandahar from Kabul. They report the inclusion of the khasadars in the regular troops, and also that an influential Saghzai has been instrumental in raising a battalion nearly 1,000 strong. 303. Harvest prospects. —The Afghan agent recently informed me that irrigated crops in the Herat district are doing well, and that in consequence the harvest is expected to be more abundant than was anticipated. Russian Turkistan. 304. Current affairs. —In the presence of M. Stchepkin the question of the administrative independence of Transcaspia from control by Turkistan was dis* cussed at Askhabad. M. Dorrer and other orators advocating its independence were nevertheless unable to bring up any very cogent arguments for the measure which appears to have been shelved for the moment. M. Stchepkin has since received a telegram from Prince Lvov requesting him to hand over his presidential functions to one of his colleagues and to pro ceed to Petrograd. At a Tashkent meeting of the Turkistan Supply Committee unfavourable reports were submitted by delegates to various districts pointing to the possibility of famine. The grain harvest in the Tashkent district is practically a total failure, and amounts being despatched for May from outside Turkistan only constitute for the whole of Turkistan about twice the amount necessary for Syr Darya alone. An undertaking to exchange meat from Transcaspia with Baku flour is in progress and the Herat agent notes a proposal to exchange Russian sugar for Afghan grain. In consequence of the difficulty of procuring food families continue to leave both Turkistan and Bokhara for Persia. A party of 1,000 Turkoman and 600 Sarts, conscrinted for labour in rear of the armies, left Riazanon the 26th May for Turkistan. Sarakhs Turkomans taken on the same count are reported to have reached their homes. Orders have been issued to dismantle the 55 versts of line from Bezmen towards Firiyusa for conveyance to Semirechia, 305. Frontier Guard. —At a recent meeting of the Officers and Soldiers Committee of the 7th Circle of the Frontier Guard at Askhabad, complete con fidence was expressed in General Narbut who would, it was hoped, continue to command. Want of confidence, reputedly on the ground of professional unfitness, was expressed in a Brigade Commander and two other colonels, a lieutenant, and a medical officer. The meeting proceeded to elect successors for the three senior officers objected to, and closed with a request to General Narbut to give effect to their wishes. 306. Sarakhs.— infantry detachment has been temporarily withdrawn from Russian Sarakhs of which the garrison on the 10th instant consisted of 23 Frontier Guard and 5 Turkoman sowars only. A band of Turkoman robbers, belonging to the oba of Shajji Khan son of Takka Khan, most of whom have been recently released from Russian prisons are terrorising the neighbourhood with no check on their activities. An unfor tunate merchant who was severely beaten by the robbers while extorting money from him, proceeded to the magistrate’s court to lodge a complaint but found no one willing to receive it. In the meantime the robbers reappeared and gave him a second beating. Meshed : 7he 16 th June igr/ F. A. F.

Meshed, Jjt/i June jqi6* \ i / The Senior General Staff Officer M. O. j. Memorandum. r» Tl ? e f'i ssi f n Military Agent has placed at my disposal his report to the General staff at Tashkent rendered last month. As his appreciation of the general situation may be of interest I produce it in full, After noting that the majority of Germans and Austrians in Afghanistan are fugitives in poor circumstances, and that the few remaining members if tj Turko-German mission have already done all they can without success to arolse he population, mention is made of rumours of renewed efforts by fresh agents in Afghanistan well supplied with funds. ^ ^ ntS • M continues “ The position is generally speaking as follows: it is imnos- sible to deny a certain proportion of hostility (excitement) of the Afghan population against ourselves and the English; the Amir is unpopular and main tains his position by means of a placatory policy ; German agents are of proved capacity and gold is all-powerful in the East; on our Turkish front there is a lull 'l t , h? fi 0 a enS mi? : the n . e, ? hbourin g atmosphere-in Turkistan and Persia-is f u e r Ct fi r ' fi t e f' . The fPP re omt,on of such a situation can be made instinctively, and our first task would appear to De the making of every effort to prevent the en- trance of a fresh party of German agents into Afghanistan. I am not speaking of possible surprises on our Western front, surprises which may play a decisive roe in the position of affairs m Arghamstan. I am compelled to add that facts showing the position in Russia in general and in the army in particular, revealed in both our own and the English papers,—the disorganisation of supplies, traffic the rear, the enormous proportions of desertion, agrarian and many other troubles accompanied by rumours that one country after another is becoming estranged from Russia and that the moment is not far distant when she will be abandoned y er Allies, all these facts and all these distorted rumours reach Afo-hanistan by mysterious but rapid channels, are commented on there with animation and find ready interpreters in the Germans and Austrians. It must not be forgotten that the only cause which withholds Afghanistan from entering the lists against us is the good sense of the Amir Habibullah, a sense dictated by his wholesome fear of his powerful neighbours, and that at the moment when this fear is dissipated by one cause or another, we shall find ourselves face to face with his army and savage nomad hordes. We can thus imagine the importance of the role which the Musulman population of Turkistan might be called upon to piay m such a contingency—any want of loyalty on their'part would lend to the offensive of a despotic ruler of a half wild country the proportions of a national calamity r ti 2.

Conscription.—200 recruits, conscripted on the i per 8 basis, have been sent to government factories at Kabul from lurkistan.

They requested permission of O.C. garrison fo weed out old and unfit men, and opium smokers. Over io 0 men discharged on these counts. 12 Kabul instructors are active at Mazar-i-Sbarif. Nomads —The want of success in recruiting among nomads in Turkistan led to replacement of the chief Ghulam Rasul Khan by Sardar Ayub Jan, son of Sardar Muhammad Yussuf Khan. He is renowned as a Russophobe and .t is possible that his appointment may lead to trouble with lurkoman and Bokharan flock owners on the Russo-Afghan frontier. E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.'Colonel, G.

Ma tamid-ul-Wazarah has been appointed assistant in the Revenue office and is expected to arrive from Tehran next week. 4 . Cordial telegrams have been exchanged during the week between the Governor-General and His Majesty the Shah. 5. Agha Amin-i-Hamayun has arrived from Tehran to enquire into the disputes among the Shrine officials. 6. The Home Secretary has been informed by the Governor-General, in answer to his enquiry regarding Mazinan, that Mansur-ul-Mumalik was appointed as the local people required a stranger to keep the peace between them (paragraph 8 l3»St WG6K). 7 . Persian affairs. —One Ibrahimzada (paragraph 5 of Diary No. 7), hearing that he J^as about to be arrested in connection with the murder of Musaddik-ud- Paulah (paragraph 1 above), fled to the neighbouring hills in company with some other ruffians. A letter has been found in the handwriting of the recent proclama tions posted-in the Shrine signed “ Extremists,” which implicates him in the crime. He and his companions have proclaimed themselves outlaws and have already raided the village of Tabatkan. 8. The force which left Meshed early in April (paragraph 16 of Diary No. 14 ) to punish the Shikari and 2 ffishki robbers have done nothing, but have not yet returned to the city. 9 . The bread question has received serious consideration during the week, a commission of prominent townspeople having been formed to regulate it. It was decided that the rate for sale of Government grain to bakers should be 12f Tumans per Kharwar .and that of private stocks 18 Tumans : and the prices of bread were fixed at 1 Kran 12 shahis per man for the inferior and-1 Kran 16 shahis per 'man for the superior quality. These rates for bread were objected to by the bakers who refused to prepare a sufficient quantity, and the rates being raised to 2 Krans and 2 Krans 8 shahis resulted in a larger amount being made than could be sold and an organised public protest against the increase in prices, which have again been reduced in consequence. The matter is not yet finally settled. The Governor-General has recommended that no further permission be given for the export of grain to Russia from Khorassan, but M. Nicolsky, who has secured his 5,000 Kharwars with much difficulty, assures me that he has no .intention of asking for more. 10. Orders have been issued to give the Bajgiran-Meshed road into the charge of the Public Work$ Department, and to cancel the contract which, as previously reported, had been made with the Rais-i-Tujjar for its care. This is a satisfactory move, US the Rais had apparently done nothing to keep this important highway in order.

The result was satisfactory. 13 On Monday, at the request of Shahzada Saham-ul-Mulk (paragraph 2 last week), I took him to call on MM. Nicolsky and Kornehs. This young man is very friendly and promises to do all we require of him and to consult us m important matters. 14 . Russian affairs.-^. Nicolsky’s position is rather an unpleasant one at the present moment. He received news early in the week that the lower ranks of the ftussian troops in garrison were about to hold a meeting at which his presence would be required in order that he might be cross-examined as to his views on the present crisis, etcetra. This has not come to pass yet, and the men are quiet and orderly. 15 Forty Barbari recruits are said to have been procured for the Cossack brigade, but Colonel Mamanof (paragraph 8 of Diary No. 18 ) informs us that he is having the greatest difficulty in finding men prepared to enlist on the terms he is empowered to offer. 16 . Persian and German Intrigues. —Six persons who were deported to Russiar early last year for political reasons have returned to Meshed during the week. This is not satisfactory : these men will be carefully watched. 17. At the weekly meeting of democrats it was suggested to establish a society of “ Terrorists ” who should be under the Central Committee. The objects of this scheme are to procure the removal (by murder, if necessary) of any official or other person who oppresses the people, and to prevent unauthorised ruffians, such as Ibrahimzada and the “ extremists,” from taking the law into their own hands. It was decided to draw up rules and present them at the next meeting. 18 . News from Turbat-i-Haidari—On 5th instant M. Antipoff requested M. Mikhailoff to supply him with an escort of the consular sowars as he wished to pay sopie return visits. Mikhailoff refused. On the 6 th Antipoff informed the Governor officially that from that date he was to be recognised as Consul and his signature alone accepted on documents. It is reported later that Mikhailoff has sold is effect^ and intends to leave shortly. 1 19 . The commanders of the local Karasuran and Karai sowars have been summoned to Meshed to receive instructions from the Rais-i-Kushun. 20. The issue of 20 Kharwars of barley to the local Russian troops from the Maliyah is sanctioned. 21. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Twelve persons have telgraphed to the Home Secretary complaining of Shaji-as-Saltanah on account of his yout and inexper ence. They are believed to be Bizdis, and the complaint to be m com nection with the matter mentioned in paragraph 17 last week. It may be necessary to appoint as Governor Shaukat-ud-Daulah, Shaji s elder brother, who, after his release from prison, recently reported, appears to have nothing more against him. He is the hereditary chief of the Taimuris, being c eldest son of the late chief. Shaji will have nothing to complain of m the event of his brother displacing him. 22. News from Karez.- —The complete failure of the rains has made feeding horses so expensive that it is found better to postpone till next year the for our troops (paragraph 9 last week). Fodder would have to be sent wit ® . and the cost of carriage would cause the value of each horse to be nearly dou by the time it reached Kirman. «N e ws from Herat—We have received a friendy reply to a letter addressed to aib-ul-Hukumah condoling with him on the recent death of his mother. 24 A further communication from Jews in Bokhara to their brethren in Herat (paragraph 15 of Diary No. 16 ) recommends them not to come at present owing to dearness of provisions. ' Kurban Muhammad, the Turkoman Sardar who has been for some time wanted b^ the Russian Government, has heard that he can now return safely to his home. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has given him leave to do so. at ’ -F* 1 ? arrival of a suspicious Indian dervish from [Kandahar [is reported. Lhe aib-ul-HiLkumah has ordered his return to Kandahar and recommends the authorities there to take security from him or deport him to India. 27 . Kazim Beg invited Kurban Muhammad (paragraph 25 above) to dine with him on hearing that he intended to leave for Russia, and requested him to photograph the German party. The Naib-ul-Hukumah, however, told him neither to accept the invitation nor to take the photograph. 28 . Orders have been issued to supply the German party with summer clothing. 29 . Wagner gave Abd-ur-Rahman (paragraph 25 last week) 500 Krans on 4 he 6 th instant. 30 . Nasrullah visited Haji Ghulam Husain (paragraph 18 of Diary No. 18 ) and asked him to stand or provide security for a messenger whom he desired to send to Abd-ur-Rahman’s nephew at Meshed, to enable him to obtain a passport. The Haji replied that he would not stand security nor did he know of any one who would. (A. B.- The nephew of Abd-ur^Rahman i&amp; said to be one Ghulam Riza .* enouiries are being made in Meshed.) 31 . Abd-ur-Rahman is said to have stated that he sent many letters to Herat from Meshed by the post of Abdullah Khan, the local Afghan trade agent, but that as no replies were ever received he suspects that Abdullah Khan did not forward his letters, and intends to complain against him. 1 f 32 . It seems that the Naib-ul-Hukumah told Maulvi Barkat-ullah last week (paragraph 21 of Diary No. 19 ) that Kazim Beg should be warned to curb his temper. The maulvi communicatedjRis message to Kazim Beg who now threatens to kill our agent. 33 . It is reported that His Majesty the Amir gave the Jemadar who was in charge of Kazim Beg’s party £ 1,000 on leaving Kabul last year for Kazim to expend as required. Of this sum £100 has been spent and the balance is now deposited in the Herat treasury on the return of the Jemadar to Kabul. 34 . Our agent gives the list of Germans and adherents in Herat as under ( 1 ) At Bagh-i-Kertah :— Wagner. A German refugee from Russia who is leaving for Kabul. 1 Six Austrians known by the names of Bayerl, Ali Khan, Ghulam Riza, Hinder, Frans and Mirza. Abd-ur-Rahman and Puri Khan. Servants .—Nasrullah, Saiyid Riza, Muhammad Arab, Ismail, Naib Abbas, Agha Karim, Kaka Shirazi and three syces. ( 2 ) In the town :— Kazim Beg, Maulvi Barkat-ullah, Haji Ahmad, with two Persian servants, Nur Muhammad and Asghar.35 . Condition of the Country .—It is reported from Turshiz that one Jabbar, a naib'bi the gendarmerie, has become an outlaw and with a gang of 50 persons is raiding the neighbourhood. 36. Shuja-ud-Daulah continues to complain to Tehran of encroachment on the part of the Chief of Bujnurd and asks for leave to oppose him by force. This has been refused, but the Chief has been reprimanded and warned by the [Some Secretary. 37 . Another conflict has occurred between the Kuchani sowars and Khuddu’s men. The robber chief again succeed in escaping, and is now said to be at Takht-i- Mirza, to which place the Chief of Bujnurd has despatched 100 sowars to deal with him. 38 . The Governor of Darajez has induced the Governor-General to grant a pardon to Agha Khan, one of Khuddu’s lieutenants, who with 10 men has come in. W. G.

(1) The assessment of the land revenue of Chakhansur is said to have been increased by 1,000 kharwars of grain. (2) The Afghan authorities are showing signs of uneasiness regarding the ' intentions of the Government of India. I hear of several Afghan spies and news-reporters being seen in Sistan. (3) See Diary No. 12. Kadkhuda Haji, son of Gulab, Gurgich, whom Kadkhuda Mirak Kudbedani was sent by the Afghan authorities to entice back to Chakhansur from Khwash, has now reported his return to the Governor at Kala Kang. He informed the latter that he and his men had been drawing 20,000 krans per mensem from the British Government, and that he had been promised lands at Nushki. He had however obeyed the summons of the Amir. The Governor has received him kindly and restored to him the villages of Shoro and Khwabgah, his Govern ment revenue being assessed at 500 kharwars of grain. (4) See last week’s Diary. I hear that Mir Jehind at the last minute has excused himself from going to Quetta on the score of age. All the younger Safdars of Sarhad are said to be on the road now, accompanying the Indian Assistant Political Officer at Khwash. The Land Revenue of Sistan. See last week’s Diary. The excitement in Sistan over the Mujtehids’ case has been allayed by the Persian Government telegraphing that they will not oust the elder mullas from their villages. The latter, however, will have to pay about 50 per cent, higher revenue. The Finance Agent is trying to arrange a compromise between the two parties of brothers, under which the three younger men will receive the separate farm of two or three villages. This seems the only way to prevent a recurrence of intrigue. The late Karguzar of Sistan. 1 The “ Chaman ” newspaper of Meshed, under date 16 th April 1917 , has re ported an interview with Motasim-us-Saltaneh in which the latter announced that as soon as he reached Tehran he would get most of the officials at Birjand and Sistan with whom he had not been friendly, dismissed. In the paper s issue of 19 th April there is printed a letter from Motasim-us-Saltaneh, contradicting the correct ness of this account. The Customs Department, Sistan. !' ■ F -letter Dated See Diary No. 37‘, for the week ending 9thSept3mber 1916 . In consequence of a representation made by me to His Majesty’s Legation, it appears that M. Kornelis, Provincial Director of Customs at Meshed, was recently ordered to with draw Asadullah, Ferash Bashi, from this province to Meshed. Instead, the man has been sent to Koh Malik Siah for a period of 40 days, so it is announced here, to help the Customs Director there in dealing with the large number of caravans now arriving from India. If the man returns to Sistan at the expiry of the period mentioned, I think we would have been better pleased to see the original order carried out even if it involved the man’s promotion ! It is to be hoped anyh that the man will return in a chastened spirit! IGl'J ■' ’jrri F. B. PRIDEATJX, LieuL-Colonelf His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and K G. M.

(1) An Afghan news-reporter states that Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan of Chahar Burjak has received a letter from Bahram Khan of Bampur reporting the safe arrival of three Turks forwarded through Ata Muhammad Khan’s agency. The letter has been given to the Governor of Chakhansur who has forwarded it to His Majesty the Amir. As the reporter gains nothing by making a false statement of this sort, I cannot confidently brand his story as a concoction. At the same time it may be, he being one of the men who used to assert that a party would leave via Amalaf or Jali Robat. (2) Two reporters write that two Germans arrived at Kala Kang on the 24 th May. They seem to be actively inspecting the Afghan troops. News from Afghanistan. (1) There is a good deal of activity in Afghanistan in regard to recruiting and the accumulation of arms. It is commonly said that rifles of all sorts are being purchased by the authorities, even 100 Tomans being given for a weapon, and gun dealers have been urged to visit India and promised double the normal prices for any rifles brought back. It is said that eleven Chakhansuris, headed by Abdur Rasul, brother of Jalal Khan Nurzai, Samad Khan Ghilzai, Ahmed Khan and Nabi Khan, are starting for Nushki and Quetta in this connection. (2) The Afghan Government are said to have supplied a large quantity of rifles to Baluchis collected at Shorawak. (3) There has been trouble between the Afghan Governor of Rigan and the Muhammad Hasani tribe of Baluchis who have resisted attempts at conscription. The Baluchis are said to have crossed into British territory. (4) There is a recrudescence of talk in Afghanistan about the Parliament to be convened. The Persian Parliament. Officials in Sistan have received instructions from Tehran this week both by post and by telegraph on the subject of the forthcoming elections for Parliament. The people of Sistan, Mullas, merchants and agriculturists, seem to be solidly anti-Democrat, and take very little interest in the politics of the Capital. News from Birjand. There has been a certain amount of talk lately that Shaukat-ul-Mulk is getting Khan Malik, the late Finance Agent, and Colonel Ali Naki Khan, the Cavalry Commander, sent back. It is now announced that Khan Malik has been posted to Sultanabad. We have no fear that the other man will return. .E i. f i ■The health of Sistan. An epidemic of fever lias been raging in the villages on both sides of the border. Some cases of “ relapsing fever,” occasionally terminating fatally, have also been diagnosed in Sistan. This fever seems to be identical with that which is so often contracted by travellers who use the caravanserais on the Meshed-Birj and road, the infection being conveyed by vermin. Afghan Robbers. An Afghan caravan from Quetta has been looted at Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah by some 14 Sarhaddi Baluchis who have recently been living near Bandar Kamal Khan. The Jalaudar, Jalal Khan Nurzai, captured two of the robbers and took them to the Governor of Chakhansur who has promised to recover the 2,000 Tomans worth of goods said to have been carried off. F.

O Meshed Diary No. 19, for the week ending the 12lh May 1917. 1. Persian officials. With some little trouble we induced the Governor General to take the necessary steps to trace the murderer of the Rais-i-Nazmiah (paragraph 1 last week). A committee has sat throughout the week for the purpose °iu evl( J ence a g amst various persons who were arrested on suspicion and their labours have been attended with some success. The actual murderer appears to have been one Ismail who received as a reward Tumans 200 from Husain Khan one of the dismissed police officials mentioned last week ; and with him was IN aib Ibrahim another police official who recently lost his post. The latter is in custody, but the former is said either to have absconded to Tehran or to be in hiding in the city. Search is being made for him and telegrams have been despatched to various places ordering his arrest. r It is found that the regular democratic society had no part in this crime and are no in sympathy with it, and that they were not responsible either for the proclama tion appended to the diary of last week nor for that which has since appeared in the ‘ ' ran * a lon spelled). These are the work of some irresponsible extremists who have not a large following in the city and do not represent an organised society. The question of a successor to the murdered man has not yet been decided ? nd Superintendent is acting as Chief for the present under orders irom Tehran. , 2 - Wasuk-us-Saltanah, Under Secretary for War, who has been on pilgrimage to Meshed, left for Tehran on the 9 th. Shahzada Saham-ul-Mulk, who accompanied him, has remained here, having been appointed Assistant to the Governor-General vice Alam-us- Saltan ah resigned. The latter has left for Tehran. Mushar-us- Saltanah has resigned the position of Peshkar and he also intends to return to the* capital before long. 3. N ajd-us-Saltanah, the Peshkar-i-Maliyah, has been dismissed and M. Konelis has been appointed in his place. This appointment is popular among the more enlightened section of the community as M. Konelis is much respected. He is particularly friendly with us. His successor in the Customs Department has not yet been announced. 4 . Shahzadah ’Itibar-ud-Daulah, Secretary to the Mutawalli Basil, returned to Meshed from Tehran whither he had been to present the yearly gift from the Shrine to His Majesty the Shah. He called upon me immediately on arrival. ~ 5 . Nabil-ud-Daulah, late Karguzar of Sabsawar, has been appointed Karquzar of Turbat-i-Haidari vice Mujallal-us-Saltanah dismissed for absence without leave. 6. Persian affairs.—li is reported that elections for a national assembly have been ordered to take place throughout the country. J 7 . Two local news-papers with democratic tendencies, the “ Chaman ” and the “ Bahar” have published articles protesting against M. Konelis 5 appointment to the Revenue Department (paragraph 3 above). The Karguzar informs me however that no importance attaches to their view's which need not be seriouslv considered. ’ y 8. With reference to paragraph 1 of Diary No. 17 , the Governor-General has been asked by the Minister of the Interior for an explanation.of the apnointment of Mansur-ul-Mumalik as Deputy Governor of Mazinan. 9 . British affairs. —I have been asked by the Officer Commanding the troops at Kirman to arrange for the purchase of horses in the Karez district and he has placed money at my disposal for the purpose. The duty is entrusted to Ala-ud-Din our Karez agent, and Shuja-ul-Mulk and Shaji-us-Saltanah have promised to help’. 10. A week ago an Afghan military officer, Captain Muhammad Muhsin Khan arrived in Meshed from Herat on a mission from the Naib Salar to obtain true I t \ j * i IA I Letter Datud --ip dGN S£CK;y:'';r„;-i i: °* 46 m 15 JUN 19172 information regarding the war and current events. He would not come to vmt us but we arranged for him to be interviewed by a reliable man, Khan Bahadur Muhammad Ali Khan, who put himself to much trouble and some expense for the purpose. 11 Russian affaks.-M.. Nicolsky called upon me on the 7th to discuss the nosition in the town following upon the murder of the Rais-i-Nazmiah I was able to give him some useful information regarding the Russian element in the extremist party and induced him to arrest Fulad (paragraph 9 last week). The indirect connection of this man with the crime seems to be highly probable. 19 The Karquzar informs me of the detection and arrest of another Austrian escaped prisoner, disguised as a Turkoman, in the vicinity of the city. He will be handed over to the Russian Consulate-General. 13 The Kuchan difficulty (paragraph 4 last week) has been settled, but there is much feeling against Dabir-us-Sultan who has left for Russia for change of air. 14 Persian and German Intrigues.— murder of the Rais-i-Nazmiah has been discussed in the democrat meetings during the week It was said that as the democrats had no connection with the crime they should help the Government to bring the perpetrators to justice, even to the extent of offering rewards from their funds which was done. At the usual weekly meeting held on the 10th mstant the president Haji Muhammad Jafar, indulged m some remarks complimentary to me but added that it must be remembered that the British also had. their objects to gain and that their consideration towards people and respect for the laws of foreign’countries are not entirely disinterested. He pointed out the difference between British and Russian methods, and remarked that it was not difficult to j understand how the British had become possessed of so much of the globe with so ‘ trouble. The speaker concluded with the warning that though our kindness i deserved respect, too much reliance should not be placed upon our friendship and sympathy, for the reason stated. 15 News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—M. Nicolsky says that apparently nothing 'but force will remove Mikhailoff (paragraph 12 last week). The Persian Foreign Office in accordance with a request from the Russian Legation, have directed the local officials to regard M. Antipoff as the Consul and to have no further dealing with Mikhailoff. 16 . News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam—A Russian officer has left Meshed for Jam to relieve Lemansky. 17 . Shaji-us-Saltanah despatched five sowars to Bizd to bring some offenders to justice. The inhabitants resisted and shots were fired but no one was seriously hurt. 18 . News from Karez. —Shuja-ul-Mulk believes that there has been an out break of cholera in the village of Meshed-i-Riza but the Russian doctor, after investi gation. denies it. Some deaths occurred, apparently from something of the kind but no fresh case has been reported for several days now. 19 . Neivs from Herat. —Prayers for rain were offered during the week by the officials and people en masse. 20. Unfavourable comment is made oh the treatment of the German party by the Naib-ul-Hukumah wfco shews no attention beyond receiving a weekly visit. 21. On 30 th April our agent was insulted by Kazim Beg who rode past him as he was walking outside the town. The agent took no notice, but subsequently reported the incident to the Naih-ul-Hukmnah who gave him re-assuring promises and was later heard addressing Maulvi Barkatullah angrily in Hindustani. 22. Further efforts of Bayerl to sell horses have been unsuccessful. 23 . The Naib-ul-Hukumah, has ordered that the German refugee who was recently brought to Herat from Bala Murghab be sent to Kabul under suitable escort. 24 . An Indian named Puri Khan, said to be a Turkish emissary, was found outside the town and brought to the Naib Solar, who reheved him of his papers3 et cetera and directed that he should be placed in confinement. Later he ordered him to be removed to Bagh-i-Kertah. &gt; 25 . A Persian refugee brought recently from the Ghurian frontier has been recognised by Nur Muhammad, a servant of Kazim Beg. The latter obtained pemission from the Naib-ul-Hukumah to take him over and later Wagner brought him to Bagh-i-Kertah. Jt transpires that he is one Abd-ur-Bahman who entertained a German party at Shahrud some two years ago. He seems to have brought household necessaries for Wagner in his saddle bag, and states that he has some secret papers for delivery to the Amir. He greatly pleased Wagner by asserting that Bussia 1 and Persia were about to join the Central Powers. This man is described as of middle size, dark, of thin face, without beard, and having eyes small and deep set. 26 . Condition of the Country. —Bain has fallen generally outside and is daily expected in Meshed. It is now too late for this year’s crops however. 27 . Beferring to paragraph 24 last week an encounter between Darajez sowars and Khuddu’s men is reported. Two of the former were killed and the casualties sufiered by the robbers are not known but one of their headmen was captured. 28 . Chinaran and its neighbourhood are unsettled owing to the intrigues of Shuj a-ud-Daulah and the Chief of Bujnurd against one another. Baids and thefts are frequent, and it does not seem that anything but the removal of one or the other will set matters right. W. G. GBEY, Lieutenant-Colonel, Meshed ; 12 th May 1917 . His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of tlw Government of India in Khorasan. APPENDIX. (Vide paragraph 1 of Diary.) Translation of Proclamation posted in Meshed Shrine. To the Governor-General and all the Heads' of Departments in Khorasan. Since slave-dealing was stopped among the African savages the wretched Persians are bartered from hand to hand. If the minor appointments and Govern ment posts continue to be sold to rapacious {lit. vulture-resembling) and greedy {lit. corpse-devouring) people you may expect to receive the rewards of your actions. Yes, oh democrats! This is not the time for silence and apathy. Form your assemblies and watch carefully the doings of the officials. Do not fear, unveil the truth of each matter and concerning each person. The 44 patriotic extremists,” sacrificing themselves for the nation, will give you all possible support. Long live justice. {The same seal.) G. M. Pre^s, Simla —No. Cl42 F.D.—12*6-17.—30-M.D,JT. Intelligence Summary No. 19, for the week ending the 12th May 1917. .. ^ 8 J 4 l 1 '^ ” Ehoeasan and N. E. Persia. 227. Rrfssinn /bw.—Colonel Gustoliinhas been granted leave on medical certificate. He is selling off his horses and effects and his return seems un likely. 228. Assassination. — 4 number of arrests of persons implicated in the death of the Chief of Police have been effected, and one of the actual perpetrators is said to ba^ e been detained. The Democrats as a body repudiate auy share in t e crime, but some of the arrested persons belong to this party. As in Persia, many broken and disappointed persons join the Democratic ranks this fact has little real significance. 229. Herman emissaries. —Abdul Wahab, who is a Bahai, beyond some details of Niedermeyer's departure in Turkoman disguise from Sar-i-Pul during the mnrch of the Turkistan German party to Herat, has given little informal tion of interest. His statement corroborates report rendered last September of the assistance given to Neidermeyer by Sardar Abdul Mijid Khan, the abscond ed Governor of Shiburghan. He asserts that the names found in his papers are those of relations and other Bahais, and states that since his return to Persia last summer he has only recently reopened relations with the German party at Herat. This is possibly true : at the same time a question in one of the letters captured addressed to him, regarding the number of antique coins which he has been able to col lect, points to previous communication. His companion, Ali Akbar alias Mirza Hussain, in his flight from Afghan istan seems to have been a very capable and trusted German agent. Abdul Wahab denies any knowledge of his present whereabouts, but the description of Mirza Hussain has been circulated to all concerned as a precautionary measure. 230. Tnrbat-i Bailari and Jam.— curious mousse appears to have been reached at the former place, M. Mikhailov refusing to hand oVer charge to M. Antipov and to depart. He does not acknowledge the authority nf M. Nikolsky as having nnv jurisdiction over him, and probably counting on the disorganisa tion of affairs in Russia, appears inclined, barnacle dike, to cling to his post. In the meantime not a word of his report on the Russian agents on the frontier has been issued. As Lieutenant Popov has alrady left, and the Mili tary Agent lias despatched a young officer of the Semirechia Cossacks to relieve M. Leman ski whose further services are dispensed with, the main object has been gained. ; i Herat and Afghanistan. 231. Germans and adherents —The Persian whose arrival was noted last week is said to be one Abdurrahman of Shahrud, a previous acquaintance of the German party. Another person, Puri Khan, at first described as an Arab has reached Herat bearing messages, it is alleged, from the Turkish Government. These were apparently received by the Naib-ul-Hukumah. Kazim Beg is said to be in great straits for money and Wagner to have little left but gold, of which he is Very sparing. He no doubt regrets the £ 10 entrusted to Sayyid Hussain. Further fruitless efforts to sell the transport animals continue. Reference paragraph 140, the despatch of the “ German ” noted therein to Kabul, together with the Jamadar attached to Kazim Beg, appears to have been decided upon. 232. Trailing.—12 field and 9 mountain guns are being regularly horsed and taken out to drill in order to train both drivers and animals. As a result of one of the first efforts a boy was run over and killed. All parades were remitted on the 30th April, the Naib Salar and garrison taking part in the prayers for rain outside the city. 233. Discharges .—The Naib Salar has rejected several petitions for dis charge on account of age, apparently owing to short-handedness in all units. Nights in bed have come down from 21 to 10 , and the men of the Kandahari IGN s 20 JUL 1917 /; A l 1 ic i-. 0 . M 46 15 JUN1917 0 JUL 1917 .j \i2 and Kotwali battalions in particular, complain of extra work due to want of men. 234 Recruits —Arrivals from Kabul report that a large body of recruits from Kabul for the Herat garrison are on the road. ^35. Defences —Orders have been issued for the replacement of the wooden bridge over the most of the Ark-i-Nau by a brick structure. The old bridge is said to have been constructed under orders of British officers. i Russian Turkistan. 236. Current affairs —M. Stchepkin and the members of the Turkistan Committee were received on arrival at Tashkent with full ceremony. Addresses were presented and M. Stchepkin outlined his programme of which one of the most urgent points was the immediate question of supplies. In this connection rerent restrictions on the use of meat in the country have been removed owing to pasture difficulties caused by the drought. The Tashkent Session of the various Turkistan Executive committees have passed the following resolutions.— (а) War to successful conclusion in concert with allies. ( б ) Confidence in Provisional Government. (c) Democratic Republic the most desirable form of government. Much talking and endless letters to the Press continue. At the same time appeals for common sense and return to normal conditions to facilitate the prosecution of the war are more in evidence. The Chief and the Traffic Manager of the Orenburg-Taskent line have been replaced owing to their reputed want of sympathy with the present Govern ment. A “ boycott ’* of the “ Turkistan Courier '* has been declared by various Turkistan societies, owing to the refusal of the editor to insert certain fitters, and to the polemical attitude of its general direction. The “ Turkistan News ” disclaims any further notice of articles or correspondence in the Courier. 237. General Kuropatkin —According to the Press Lettish societies at Riga are demanding the trial of Generals Kuropatkin and Sivers for causing the destruction of Lettish battalions on the northern front through failure to support them. 238. Bokhara .—In a letter to the “ Askhabad *’ M. Miller denies the impu tations of oppressive conduct made against the Amir and himself, and states that both are actuated by a desire for the reform of the regimd of the State on liberal lines. He asserts that the recent disorders were entirely the work of fanatical clergy provoked by the injudicious conduct of manifestants, against whose action he had made strong but unavailing protests.

Indian deserters. —Agents having reported the presence of 3 Indians in poor circumstances in the city, the men in question were brought in on the 7th and 8 th instant and proved to be— Sepoy Eazaldad, 26th Punjabis. Saiwan Nawab, Camel Transport. Telegraph coolie, Sardar Khan. The last two admitted to desertion from Nasiriyeh. Eazaldad recounted an improbable story of capture by the Turks and subsequent escape from Baghdad. An application to the Regimental Centre of the 26th Punjabis resulted in the reply that he had deserted in Mesopotamia in October last. Arrangements were made to send the men under Russian escort to our post at Sehdeh, but at the last moment two of the men developed fever, and their departure must be postponed for a week or more. Nawab is a very old man u bo looks as if be had one foot in the grave.

It appears that the Cavalry spy at Duroh never actually arrested M. Boulatofl’s news-writer there, but he intercepted about 20 letters which were enclosed in three packets. One packet was forwarded to the Ressaidar Commanding the Cavalry Detachment at Neh and was delivered to the Russian Vice-Consulate on about the 8th instant. The other two packets are on the way now from Duroh to Birjand. M. Boulatoff is very much incensed about the matter and has complained to Tehran. The agent employed by Shaukat-ul-Mulk at M. Boulatoff s request to trace the packets has reported whether in a spirit of mischief or ignorance is not known—that the sowar has been sending the packets to the British Consulate in Sistan. As a matter of fact General Tanner has now ordered the withdrawal of all Cavalry spies from the Kama^ft-Afghanistan border nnrl has exoressed his regret to me that these men should have been employed by Post Commanders without the knowledge of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and myself. German Emissaries. No news this week, except that three men disguised as fakirs are travelling down the road from Herat to Kila Kang. They are believed to be intending to look at our posts at Sistan and perhaps further north. News from Afghanistan. (11 A son of Muhammad Umar Khan Sanjerani of Bandar Kamal Khan has «t n tpd that Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan of Chahar Burjak has received a letter tlrn Mir Tehind saying : “ We have been invited by the British authorities to visit One ta We gave a„ definite reply. We will rather fight than go. We inform you as our Sardar and Chief.” This version seems to be an inaccurate one designed to olease Afghan susceptibilities. The Sardar is said to have replied : Among Baluchis you are called the Ghazi. You should not allow the British to arrest you. The Germans have stopped fighting the Russians and are attacking the British. The Afghan Government is watching events. rn The Amir of Afghanistan is said to have circulated to all Governors a notice to the effect that his country is threatened by an enemy and that he expects all his subjects voluntarily to assist him. Afghan Gun-runners. It is rumoured that Khalifa /.hair Muhammad has reached Bampur with a big caravan. He will, it is said,'fight his way into Afghanistan. The rumour requires confirmation. f ! J /I 7 The Land Revenue of Sistan. Practically all the Sardars and Kadlchudas of Sistan came to me in deputation on theil 5 th instant to protest against the treatment of the Mujtehids by Tehran. They were led by Sardar Purdil Khan, Haji Ali Khan, brother and representative of Sardar Khudadad Khan, Sardar Nasir Khan, Kadkhudar Fakir, and the Kalantar of Bunjar. Their main contention is that the rents of villages must not be arbitrarily enhanced without fair investigation. * The Finance Agent, Basir-us-Saltaneh, is talking of resigning, as he will not accept responsibility for the impending disorders if the villages are taken out of the hands of the present holders.

Meshed Diary No. 18, for the week ending the 5th May 1917. oitoil 1. Persian officials. —Musaddik-ud-Daulah, Chief Police Officer, was murdered at about 10 f.m. on the 1st instant by two persons whose identity has not yet been traced. The unfortunate man was riding slowly past the Customs Offices when five shots were fired at him from a mauser pistol by the assailants who were hidden among some trees at the roadside. This act took place within a few hundred yards of the Governor-General’s condition, all five shots having taken effect. Several explanations for this assassination have been given, the two most likely of which are, (1), that it was committed by two discharged commissaries of police, known bad characters, as an act of revenge ; and, (2), that the deceased had collected an excessive sum of money for the G overnor-General, which appears to be true. * Two days later a proclamation appeared affixed to the Shrine, a translation of which is appended to this Diary. It is believed that the commissaries above referred to, who hold revolutionary views, are responsible for this effusion in conjunction with other local democrats of the baser sort, some of whom are Russian subjects. ^ The Karguzar has telegraphed to Tehran stating that this event is the result of weakness on the part of the Governor-General, and strongly recommending his dismissal. Steps have been taken by us to press for the arrest of several suspected persons, including the discharged commissaries, and I am awaiting the result before moving further. 2. The names of three persons are under consideration for the post of Rais-i-Nazmiyah in succession to Musaddik-ud-Daulah,—Salar Nusrat, a former Rais, who was satisfactory to both Consulates General, Mudabbir-ul-Mulk, who came from Tehran to take up the post some time ago, and Shahzada Shuja-us- 3 . Some discontent is being displayed at Koh-i-Surkh against the local Gov ernor, a number of people having taken sanctuary with a local mujtahid. The matter is being dealt with. 4 . Persian affairs.—Karguzar has received a telegram from the Foreign Minister relating to a dispute which has occurred at Kuchan between a number of Kuchanis and Dabir-us-Sultan, the principal land-owner of the neighbourhood. The latter, supported by the Russian agent, refuses to act in accordance with an agreement arrived at regarding the distribution of a stream of water flowing through his land. The Karguzar is directed to arrange the matter locally with the Governor-General and to cause the necessary orders to be issued to Dabir. He is also asked to obtain from M. Nicolsky a promise that his agent shall not interfere. There is some feeling in this case. I have also received a long telegram from several notables of Kuchan detailing their grievances against Dabir-us-Sultan. 5 . Referring to the question of grain scarcity it has been arranged that Agha Kaim Mukam should purchase 15,000 kharwars of Government grain and sell it locally at 18 tumans per kharwar. This is not an entirely satisfactory arrangement, the price being still too high. The nefarious schemes of Najd-us-Sultanah (paragraph 5 last week), have come to nothing however. 6. British affairs. —I have detected M. Kaal (Russian Vice-Consul in Meshed) in an attempt to defraud a British protege of his rights, and without raising the residence and separated only by a small open space from a police station, the men on duty at which must have known what was occurring but none of them moved. The victim when removed to our hospital was already in a moribund Sultan, also a friend of ours, who seems to be the most favoured by the general public.side of the (question lia&gt;ve induced my colleague to set the matter right. It is gratifying to note that he at least desires justice for its own sake. 7. Russian affairs.—It is reported from Shirwan that three Austrian refugees (escaped prisoners) have been caught and handed over to the local Karguzar. 8. Colonel Mamanoff, Commandant of Persian Cossacks, has arrived at Meshed. 9. The Kussian community here are in a disturbed condition. Lawlessness prevails and M. Nicolsky, at no time a strong man, seems to be quite helpless. Fortunately the troops seem to be behaving well, but the recent return to Meshed of one Fulad, a Caucasus Turk who w^as deported some months ago for general misconduct, has not been beneficial. 10. Persian and German Intrigues. —The matters discussed at the democratic meeting during the past week are :— (1) The Kuchan affairs reported in paragraph 4 above. The Russian agent and Dabir-us-Sultan each came in for bitter abuse but it was decided to take no action against either but to see what the local authorities would do. (2) Sistan affairs, as described by Motasim-us-Saltanah recently. It was said that injustice had been done to the local people by the purchase of grain by the British at cheap rates. (3) Letters from Russia were read which described the local feeling in various places. It was said generally that a_republic would eventually be formed. The death of the Rais-i-Nazmiah (paragraph 1 above) does not seem to have been referred to. 11. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —The dispute between the Russian Con sulate and the Revenue Department (paragraph 11 last week) is still unsettled. 12. Mikhailoff shews no signs of moving and has given no indication of his intentions. 13 . The Russian Cossacks at Turbat are behaving badly and are said to he disregarding the orders of their commander. 14 . A Russian Cossack was captured by Baluchis near Turbat and taken to the hills where they detained him for a day or two, eventually cutting off part of his tongue before allowing him to leave. This is said to be in revenge for the death of six Baluchis w r hich occurred in a fight with a party of Russians about 1| years ago. 15 . News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Shaji-us-Saltanah loyally sent out his sowars to arrest the German messengers (paragraph 23 , last week) but their services were not required, as one was arrested in Karez and the other came to Meshed via Merv and Kaka and was apprehended in the Shrine as described below. 16 . News from Herat. —The return to Afghanistan of 20 Baluch families, which had emigrated from Chakhansur to Russian territory some years ago is re ported. The Naib-ul-Hukumah ordered their repatriation. 17 . On 21st ultimo Wagner tried to induce the Naib-ul-Hukumah to send out his mules with those of Government which were going to fetch grain, urging that it would be good exercise, of which they were in need. The Naib refused consent. It is believed that Wagner's real object was to spread false information through the muleteers. 18 . Paragraph 23 last week. Saiyid Husain bin Saiyid Rahim was detected at Karez by our agent with loyal help from the local officials. He was travelling without a passport. On arrival in Meshed on 2nd instant he handed over to me £10 in English gold wdiich he had been instructed to deliver to one Abdul Wahab, a Bahai agent of the German party, actually in Meshed, through Ahmad Barbari, whom he was to meet in the Shrine. Persons placed for the purpose arrested Ahmad and brought him to us on the night of the 2nd. It was found that he had already given to AbdulWhab the letters, two in number, of which he was the bearer, and Abdul Wahab was arrested at the caravansarai which Ahmad had visited in company with him. The letters are in Persian. One merely asks for news and old coins if any can be found, and the other proposes that Abdul Wahab should come to Herat via Russia bringing four Russian passports. The three men are still in custody and enquiry is proceeding, the result of which, with the letters mentioned, will be submitted in due course. It is disappointing but not surprising to find that the German party had induced their friend Haji Ghulam Husain to help them to the extent of providing a messenger and acting as post office. The reasons given by our agent for this lapse on the part of the Haji are that he himself is precluded from cultivating his acquaintance, and that the chemist cannot afford to lose custom. 19 . The Naib-ul-HuJcumah complained to Wagner on 24 th ultimo of the conduct of Saiyid Riza in having beaten one of the Mehmandar’s servants. 20. Wagner succeeded in selling on the 25 th for krans 500 a horse for which he had previously asked 1,000. 21. Saiyid Husain (paragraph 17 above) was given the £10 mentioned by Nasr-Ullah through Haji Ghulam Husain in whose service he was ; and was also supplied with tumans 6 in local money for expenses. Of this latter sum tumans 3 J were found upon him and are being used here for feeding the prisoners. 22 . A Barbari syce named Ghulam Nabi, whom Wagner had sent to Chakhansur to bring information, has recently returned to Herat. 23 . Condition of the country. — No more rain than occasional showers are reported from any part of the country. 24 . Paragraph 3 , last week. The Governor of Darajez has also become tired of Shuja-ud-Daulah’s pretended efforts to arrest Khuddu and asks Tehran to request him to leave the matter to be dealt with between Bujnurd and Darajez. Meanwhile the robbers continue to raid at intervals. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan. 4 C130FDB ■ tti APPENDIX.

They must know that the men whose determination is firm will not be turned aside from their object by mere vicissitudes of time and circumstances : the genuine patriots and independ ence-seeking revolutionaries have not and will not display any weakness in their efforts to gain their objects : rather, so long as they have not cleaned the sacred soil of the home-land from the pollution caused by the existence of the deceivers and the tricks of the accursed selfseekers, the sword of revenge will not be sheathed The point which during the last few years has been the reason for silence on the part of the zealous ones [i.e., the interference of foreigners] should no longer be con sidered, but must now give way to the protection of the property and reputation of the Persian people.

Russian Turkistan. 213. Removal of Governor-General.—The deciding factor in the resolu- coTcrv tW 0Ve Gen f e ' al K urop atk in from office appears to have been the dis covery that a quantity of arms and ammunition had been secretly removed arsenal and distributed among the Russian population of various districts, as many as 200 having been sent to Ura Tiyube. It was argued that no justification could be found for such action, as, if apprehensive of b any rfl«nrr ers, + ^ Go ^? rnor ‘ General ha d abundant troops at his disposal without resorting to a step likely to provoke internecine civil strife. Steps to trace and recover the arms were decided upon. A speech made by Kuropatkin on the i 1 ™, 'f pril , 1 to tbe lst . Siberian Regiment at Troitskoye Camp was also consi dered directly provocative of reprisals against the Kirghiz in Semirechia while bis action (explained as a slip of the tongue) in calling for cheers for Tsar and country on that occasion rendered his departure unharmed a matter of some anxiety. t ^° n m th0 d £ a ?L P^ e ^ding his arrest, General Kuropatkin sent his A. D. C. to the offices of the Soldiers Committee with the copy of a lengthy telegram he S693GBS ' ™ j gam iwI 2 ^(iflrpssed tn t.lie head of the Provisional Government and the Minister for War' In it r.e stated that he considered that at the present juncture the same individual could not perform the dirties of Governor-General and Commander of the troops He personally asked to be relieved of Ins functions and to be given the command of the Grenadier Corps at the front, the condition of his health militating against a higher command. At the meeting at which his removal was decided upon and which lasted till ■ ! 4 M members of the soldiers and Musalman committees overruled more moderate councils* and immediate action was voted amidst cries of “ Down With Kuropatta.’’ Colonel Cherkes was elected to the command of the troops on the spot. He at first disclaimed the responsibility for which he stated he was not fitted, but was prevailed upon to accept. Beyond the general excitement no disorder is reported to have occurred, nor have the Russian military or political authorities here received any intima tion of any such. At Charjui, however, the troops arrested 3 ot their officers and had intended 30 arrests ; the men were m addition divided among them selves. Order appears to have been quickly restored, and the Soldiers Com mittee is investigating the incident which is ascribed to agents provoc teurs. 214 Khiva —The “ Askhabad ” points to the possibility of a rising among Khivan Turkomans on the lines of that of February 1916. It is significant that the latter incident was then ascribed to German agency, whereas it is now said to have been the work of reactionary officials. In this connection it is openly rumoured that the late General Folbaum, in concert with his Chief of Police, brought on the Semirechia troubles by provocative action. 215 Transcaspia .— General Kalmakon has left Askhabad on retirement * The Turkomans in the Merv and Tejen districts are reported to be perfectly quiet, and reports from PuFi-Khatun state that the frontier in that region is peace!ul. It is to be feared that the drought will seriously add to the present difficul ties of supply. In addition to crops, grazing and gardens are suffering. The increase of water in the Tejen river is now denied, and the crops are said to be hopelessly compromised. Meshed 28th April sd ; il 1917. ) E. A. F. REEL, Lieutenant-Colonel, G. S. 0.

Russian force. —There are no changes in Russian dispositions for the cur rent month. Colonel Gustchin, who has been in indifferent heaTh for some time, 'has telegraphed to ask for leave to Tashkent on medical grounds. It is probable that he will be absent for some months, and that the command of the troops will be taken over by Colonel Skuratt. 217. Persian Cossack Brigade. —Colonel Mamonov reached Meshed on the 3rd instant having been delayed at Askhabad for some 10 days in getting permission for the passage of munitions for his force. As this important matter was in the hands of two members of the soldiers committee, to whom the idea of telegraphing to Tehran or Meshed did not occur, the delay can cause no surprise, and the whole affair supplies a sufficient commentary on the state of affairs in Russian Turkistan at the present moment. 218. Punitory expedition' —Reference paragraph 183. The second phase can be considered as concluded according to established precedent, Jalal-i- Nizam being reported to have come to an agreement with Muhammad Zushki, the terms being a pardon for past offences for the latter and his appointment in charge of the safety of the roads in his district. 219. Assassination. —Reference paragragh 197. The Chief of Police re* ceived 4 bullets in the body from a Mauser pistol on the Arg square, soon after 9 P.M., on the 1st instant, and died shortly after at our hospital. The murderers, two in number, opened fire to cover their retreat on police who issued from a police-station some 50 yards distant from the scene, but caused no further casualties. No clue to their identity has yet been discovered, the Governor-General being more concerned in finding a successor willing to produce the necessary peshkash than in elucidating the affair. Apart from the threat recorded in paragraph 197, there is a strong probabi lity of the act having been committed as a vengeance for dismissal by two subordinate officers of the force. A notice stating that the same fate would overtake other corrupt officials was found pasted up in the Shrine on the following morning, and it appears that various office-holders have been threatened. 220. German emissaries. —Reference paragraph 198, Sayyid Hussain was duly arrested at Kariz, and reached Meshed under escort on the 3rd instant. He w r as the bearer of ^10 in gold and 2 scraps of paper, one a sample of the handwriting of the person to whom he was to hand the money, the other bearing the name of Niedermeyer in Persian characters, and in pencil that of Abdul VVahab. He stated that his instructions were to meet a second mes senger, travelling by another route, in the Shrine. This man would introduce him to Abdul Wahab, to whom, after the necessary identification (Nieder- rreyer’s name being apparently a pass-word) he vras to hand the money. The second messenger reached Meshed the same day, having taken the train at Kushk via Merv to Kahka, and was arrested in the Shrine later in the day. He denied having brought any communication but admitted having seen Abdul Wahab previous to his arrest. It was therefore practically certain that he had got rid of a letter. Abdul Wahab was arrested at a caravansarai the following morning, one letter, the gist of which was to say that Wagner (under his Persian name of Abdurrahman) wanted news, and that the addressee should take service at the Russian or English “ Legation ”, was found among his effects. Subsequently a second very interesting note was dug up in the room occupied by him in the caravansarai. It requested him to bring by rail (i.e.&gt; the S 707 GSBC A; line and Kushk branch) 4 Russian passports for which purpose £ ro was sent him. It is thus evident that a roundabout route through Russian territory has been substituted as a channel for communications for the more direct, but better guarded line from the Afghan frontier; the intention of Wagner and some of his party to escape via Russia is also indicated. The refusal of Wagner to employ one Najjaf as a messenger—the man having made the approval of the Naib-ul-Hukumah a condition of his accepting the service— and his objection to employing Abdulla Khan, the Afghan agent at Meshed, as a go-between, would also seem to be explained by the desire for a secret fbght which the Afghan authorities would no doubt oppose. The Russian Military Agent has telegraphed emphasising the necessity of a strict look-out at Kushk and southern stations on that line^ and better obser vation of Russian frontier posts. Unfortunately the dismissal of all regular trained police, and their substitution by inexperienced “ militia ” is likely to militate against any very efficient measures. Abdul Wahab, a native of Bushruyeh, joined the German party near that place when employed as a Mahyat savar on the first passage of the Gernrans to Afghanistan, and accompanied the Turkistan partv from Kabul. He appa rently disappeared at Sar-i-Pul at the same time as Niedermeyer. At present he is concerned in proving to us that he was in effect kidnapped and held a prisoner by the Germans. He may be expected to see the uselessness of this pose in time and to give some information of value. Papers found among his effects appear to contain the names of German agents at various places. Since his return from Afghanistan he has evidently been serving as a secret German agent. Herat and Afghanistan. 221. Germans and adherents *—Wagner has accepted half price for one of his horses. He is most anxious for news from Persia. The arrival at the Bagh-i-Kartah of a Persian, not yet identified is reported. His adherents are learning the value of consistency in successful lying, as, on stating that the dearth of rain in Afghanistan was caused by the British capture of Baghdad, they were confronted by their previous assertions that the news of the capture of Baghdad by the British was false. Reference paragraph 185. The report from Chitral that Mohendro Partap had left Zebak for Wakhan was com municated to the Russians. The General Staff at Petrograd has telegraphed to Tashkend that a sharp look-out for him is to be kept in frontier regions, and that he is to be arrested should he enter Russian territory. 222. Training .—The signallers (poetically known as the “Stars of Govern ment “) are now being instructed in encamping practice. The Naib Salar proposes to send selected men to Kabul for employment there as instructors in order to testify to the progress in the military art of the Herat troops. Officers will now only be called upon to attend one special afternoon parade per week. The sappers are turning their talents to account in improving roads in the city. 223. Promotion$.--X\\e Naib Salar has recommended Colonel Muhammad Shuaib Khan, commandant of the Khaki battalion, for promotion to Brigadier, and the transfer of Colonel Faqir Ahmad Khan from the Kotwali battalion in his place. It is stated that orders have been received from Kabul for the entertain ment of 3 additional brigadiers in the Herat garrison. After examination of the Kandahari battalion, the Naib Salar promoted two privates direct to captain, 7 to subadar, and 12 to havildar. Russian Turkistan. 224. Current affairs. — general Kuropatkin and his late Chief of the Staff, General Sivers, were despatched to Petrograd under escort on the 20fh April5*6 17 GCbP §lm!&amp; In reply to a telegram from military authorities here asking for information as to the general situation in Turkistan, the Staff at Tashkent have rephed that no disorders have occurred in the country. A slight disturbance at Bokhara had been adjusted. The Provisional Government has appointed a Committee for the govern ment of Turkistan presided over by M. Stchelkin, a member of the Duma. Among the remaining 8 members, most of whom are members of previous Dumas, are several Musulman names. A general meeting of representatives of various executive committees in Turkistan has commenced at Tashkent. The first day's session was occupied in somewhat fiery debates, each committee insisting on independent action, and condemning anything in the nature of centralisation. The picture is not par ticularly hopeful for the future. ^ The question of supplies for Tashkent and Askhabad continues to cause anxiety. Rain has fallen at and near Askhabad with beneficial effect, but unless followed by later falls no good will have been done. 225. Khiva and Bokhara ,—Both the Amir of Bokhara and the Khan of Khiva have published manifestos of constitutional reforms, the latter, in addition, having released all prisoners. The progressive element at Bokhara is not satisfied with the programme, and on this account some disorder occurred incidentally shewing the extraordinary relations prevailing between the Russian Resident (as the Political Agent has been rechristened) and present Tashkent authority. On the 21st April, some trouble occurred between manifestants for freedom and armed reactionary mullahs, and the Resident, who was visiting the Amir, was detained all day at the palace. Manifestants were arrested, and Russian troops sent for from Samarkand. A report was subsequently sent to the Provisional Government by Colonel Cherkes that the Amir was acting oppressively and was being supported in his attitude by the Resident (A. Miller). The latter was informed by Cherkes, acting for the Tashkent committee, that he was to permit no executions, those arrested were to te released, and that he and the Amir would be held jointly and personally responsible for any bloodshed. On disregard of these instructions armed force would be employed if necessary. Miller subsequently reported that he had secured the release of the arrested persons ; a company of infantry had arrived at Mew Bokhara. These he had personally conducted to Bokhara through which they had marched headed by the Resident and with the red flag flying ; order had been completely restored. 226. Fire ,—Damage to the extent of 7 million rubles has been caused by a fire at a Krasnovodsk cotton wharf, the months supply of sugar for the place being also destroyed. Meshed; T E. A. F.

Russian Turkistan. 179. The new order —Citizens of Askhabad are being enrolled in a militia with the object of replacing the police force as soon as possible. ^ Meetings of the Executive and subordinate representative committees continue in all the principal towns. The news of the change of government was received with particular enthusiasm at Termez both by the garrison and civilians. A Lieutenant-Colonel at Kahka having been reported not to be in sym pathy with the new government, two members of the Askhibad Executive Commitee were deputed to Kahka to interview him. i he wife of the Officer Commanding the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks has been reported for abusing the new government and her Cossack orderlies for adhering to it, and l am told that Colonel Kulikov himself said that he had .served the i sar for 40 years and was too old to seek another master. A rumour that the Turkoman Cavalry Regiment had been employed in suppressing the revolution and had practically been annihilated in the effort caused sufficient alarm to evoke a formal telegram of denial from Colonel Khan Yomudski, a well-known Turkoman officer at Tashkent, to which w,de publicity was given. Turkomans taken for guarding the railways are reported to have been released from the duty. Both in this measure and in the release of mili tary labourers confusion due to precipitate and impulsive action may be expected. In the general amnesty of political prisoners, Persian deportees for pro- German activity have been included. The postmaster of Tun has written to his family announcing his early return. At the present juncture perhaps little harm will be caused by this action, especially as the individuals concerned have had a discouraging lesson: at the same time such an ill-considered step is to be deprecated. 180. Sarakhs .-—According to native reports the Pristav of Russian Sarakhs and his assistant have been dismissed and the direction of affairs taken over by the Officer Commanding troops who has ordered the elders of Turkomans to attend for orders. A deputy of the Executive Committee is said to have arrived and the authorities to be arranging with the Persian Governor of Sarakhs for the transport of 2,000 kkarwars of grain to Transcaspia, the Turkomans having refused transport.

Russian force. —The Military authorities have received instructions from General \udenich to form officers and soldiers committees on the lines of those now acting m Russia. Each squadron will elect i officer and 4 other ranks ; these in turn will elect a regimental committee, and in conjuction with the militia unit a committee, representative of the detachment will be formed, from which deputies will be sent to the Headquarters of the Caucasus Army. Owing to the dispersal of the force in small detachments the process may be expected to f take some time. : r A Cossack on detachment at Chinaran has committed suicide. , This is the second recent case, the first emqciding with i the arrival of General Sukovkin, and forming one of the grounds pn which the “ small post ” system was consi dered undesirable. ’ ~ 182. Persian Cossack Brigade. —A fracas has occurred between m^n of this force and certain native Russian subjects at Meshed. The men ran to fetch nnf ir d^ CS * disturbance was stopped before anything serious had occurred. The Russian subjects concerned have been arrested. Last week the Persian Cossacks were in trouble with the police. 1 ^3* Puntfory expedition. —The Zushki robbers, aided by the difficult nature of the country, have checked the Persian force at Kang ; and the Commandant, Jalal-i-Nizam is reported to be entering into negotiations with the robbers. This is quite in accordance with the normal procedure of such expedi tions in their first phase. l8 4 ; Serious scarcity may well occur both in Khorasan and the Herat district if the rainTall be much longer delayed. Want of water in the Murghab is already reported from Transcaspia. Herat and Afghanistan. 185. Germans and adherents.—The Afghan agent at Meshed, Abdullah Khan, (V. Kabul Diary of 31st December 1916, paragraph 10 and Meshed Diaries passim) seems to be responsible for raising the spirits of the German party by indicting to the Naib-ul-Hukumat a farrago of lies anent Turkish successes and the departure of all Russian troops in confusion from Khorasan. His sympathy with our enemies is also shewn by the proposal to send a letter from Wagner to Tehran under cover to Abdullah Khan at Meshed, with a re- quest to him to secure the services of one Abdurrahman to take it on its way. In the end, however, it appears to have been decided to entrust the missive to one Sayyid Hussain son of Sayyid Rahim Herati who was expected to leave for Meshed with the caravan of Bocha Naib Ghulam. The latter was the person who handed a German cypher telegram to the Russian Consulate General some 2 years ago. A person whom I had requested to keep an eye on Mohendro Partap arrived here during the week, having travelled post haste from Mazar-i-Sharif to inform me that Mohendro had left on the 23rd March towards Badakshan. Although no confirmation has been received as yet from elsewhere, the intel ligence appears sufficiently circumstantial. Mohendro was provided with an escort of 20 Sowars of the regular cavalry, and with transport secured by the authorities. Concerning the latter there seems to have been some difficulty, the animals first produced not meeting with the travellers approbation and better 4 i. 25 MAY '1917 25 JUN 1917* 2 ^ one being in the end secured. The cortege left by the Tashkurgan road the.r destination being announced as Badakshan where Mohendro was expected to wad some time for a favourable opportunity of escape to ChUral or any more promising refuge. , , ^ The Russians have been informed and the Military Agent states that he , has telegraphed on the subject to Tashkent. ,86. Promotions and discharges.-Ughtmng promotion and its converse is the order of the day at Herat. After examination of the artillery the Naib Salar promoted 8 sepoys to the ranks of captain and jemadar and . 7 to the rank ol havddar for proficiency in their work. An examination of the Ghazn.chi battalion resulted in the metamorphosis of one sepoy to captain, 6 to subadar, and 20 to havildar. Three artillery captains were discharged, and 2 transferred to dts- ponibilite. At a further inspection of the artillery he discharged a captain and 2 sepoys, the latter being deported to Kabul; a havildar and a sepoy were each promoted to jemadar. 187. Munitions. — A convoy of 170 camels reached Herat from Kabul via Kandahar on the ist instant. They are possibly part of the 4°° which were nreviouslv expected. Beyond cloth for uniforms, 400 rifles (from description Martini carbines), with corresponding sets of equipment, 245 boxes of S. A. ammunition, and 4 boxes of star shells we.e received. The bullets of the ammunition were nickelled. Conscription —The Naib Salar furnished the Naib-ul-Hukumat on the e h i'nsmnt with list's of the inhabitants of Herat founded on taxation returns witha view to the issue of orders for the collection of recruits on the . per 8 basis. Russian Turkistan. * ,89. Oath of allogiancs. On the 30th March the Tashkent garrison swore allegiance to the. Provisional Government. In addressmg the troops a t th ceremony General Kuropatkin urged discipline and united efforts ot all ranks. ”p y eechthe following passfge occurred. .-We, as we are by native races, are in a peculiar position. I hope that ln he main these races are both quiet and obedient, but there is no doubt that a rebell P“ s _ element exists among them, and 1 am already in receipt of reports of the m cation of ill-will from Semirechia, Samarkand, Ura Tiube, and other places. An identical oath was taken at Askhabad on the 3rd instant, the new posi tion of affairs being explained to some 300 Turkoman representatives after the ceremony. iqo. Executive committees.—I'nz central committee at Tashkent declares the civil executive power to be vested in the various committees under the general direction of policy by the Governor General. The Askhabad Committee is occupied for the moment chiefly '‘‘h the ques tion of supplies. A general stock-taking of supplies of all sorts on hand J i e a stock of wheat sufficient for 18 days only, and measures were taken to secure an additional quantity. It was decided to depute a member to Khorasun tor t purchase of wheat. This gentleman, accompanied by an officer, reacnea Meshed in the course of the week. The question of the export of sugar to Persia formed the subject of a lively debate on the discovery that in spite of the prohibition of export, upwards 5,800 tons according to the figures given—had reached this country. iqI, General Selivanov in command of the Exhibition Train, who is a general on the active list and is described as - the Hero o PrzemysI was arrested at Golodnaya Steppe station for want^ of sympathy wlth th ^ ne ,£ d from n ent, and was conducted to TashkentTiy General Yeropheev w Certain reactionary military and police otnci that place for the purpose, also been arrested.192. Amnesty .—100 criminals have been released from Askhabad prison in accordance with the orders of the Provisional Government regarding remission of sentences. 193. Turkomans.—k meeting of Turkomans at Merv resolved on the cons titution of committees on the lines of those of other bodies and expressed the opinion that Turkomans would be performing work of more importance to the nation by their agricultural labour than by serving as guards in rear of the armies. If the latter were released they intended to institute a tax in lieu for ^ the duration of the war. They condemned their present system of local govern ment and proposed self-elective bodies instead. General Kuropatkin despatched a telegram authorising the realisation of the latter aspirations. 194. Confiscations .—The Askhabad Executive Committee has sent ad dresses to the Ministers of War and Justice stating that the operations of the Gurgan force as regards punitory collection of live-stock from the Yomud still continue. As the rebellion occurred in consequence of the orders for military labour of last June, it is imagined that an amnesty will be granted. Should this be the case they ask that measures to provide for the families of soldiers killed during the operations be taken, as a portion of the confiscations were originally earmarked for that object. 193. Bokhara and Khiva .—In reply to a telegram from the Turkistan Agricultural Society, noting the anomaly of the continuance in the midst of a free Russia of such oppressed populations as those of Bokhara and Khiva, the Minister of War states that a special commission will be appointed in the near future to reform the legislative and economic conditions of these states.

Persian officials .—Majid Khan, son-in-law o f the Head Munshi of the 'Russian Consulate-General, has been appointed Governor of Radkan. 2. Mutasam-us-Saltanah, late Karguzar of Sistan, has arrived at Meshed en route to Tehran. He visited this Consulate-General on the 19 th. 3. Persian affairs .—Referring to paragraph 2 last week the Shrine troubles have ceased for the time being and the discontented officials have returned to their homes. The three principal grievances against the Mutwali Bashi seem to be • {a) the loss of a valuable Kuran owned by the Shrine ; (b) the custom of paying various officials from Shrine funds whose employ ments are not provided for in the budget; and ;(c) the absence of any audit or other check upon the expenditure. It is now said that His Majesty the Shah intends to send his own servant, Amin-i-Hamayun, to enquire into these matters. 4. Our friend the Rais-i-Nazmiah informs me that he has been reprimanded by the Home office for submitting his new year’s budget in the French language. 5. The arrival in Meshed from Tehran of a Bahai preacher, H a ji. Shaikh Rais, is expected shortly ; protests are being organised against his being allowed to ■enter the town. 6 The Governor-General has been informed by the Minister of the Interior that the question of a representative assembly is being considered |m Tehran and that he should advise the loyal subjects in Meshed who are m favour of such an arrangement to abstain from demonstration for the present. The Russian agents referred to last week have returned to Askabad on the matter hem? arranged. It is said that scarcity there is becoming acute.12. No rain has fallen as yet, and grain prices have risen during the week. 13 . News from Turbal-i-Shaikh Jam.—There is no news yet of the Ilbai&lt;d having left for Turbat-i-Haidari : he will certainly not go so long as M. Mikhailoff is there. Colonel Scouratt talks of paying this place a visit and probably the llbaigi will be saved the trouble of the journey by arranging matters with him. 14 . News from Karez. —The caravan of Bacha Naib Ghulam (paragraph 21, last week) arrived after my departure but no Saiyid Husain bin Saiyid Rahim accompanied it. One Saiyid Husain bin Saiyid Ahmad, who bears some resemblance to the description given, is being examined here, but he appears to be merely a pilgrim from Herat. Meanwhile Herat informs us that for two days before his report, received on 18 th instant, was written Saiyid Husain bin Saivid Rahim had disappeared from the city. Further enquiry is being made. 15 . News from Herat. —The Jewish community of Herat, refugees from Bokhara, have received a re-assuring communication from their Bokhara brethren notifying that owing to changed circumstances in Russia they can return without fear 16 . A census, is being organised for Herat and its neighbourhood and some think that military conscription is intended to follow. 17 . Two more thieves concerned in the Badghist robbery (paragraph 18 , last week) have been brought in to Herat for punishment. 18 . Some of the Turkomans formerly reported as having settled in khalisah lands near Herat have asked for permission to visit the frontier near Gulran ostensibly for purposes of grazing their flocks. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has refused it : probably suspecting that the people wish to return to Russian territory on account of recent changes. He has moreover ordered all flcck-owners now at or near the frontier to be sent into the interior. t, Meshed' 16 SUgar menti0ned “ P ara g ra P h 17 , last week, has been allowed to proceed 20 .

Catisd 27 Meshed Diary No. 17, for the week ending the 28th April 1917, 1 . Persian officials. —Mansur-ul-Mumalik, Nardini, has been appointed Deputy Governor of Mazinan in the Sabsawar district. A number of the local people have protested against the appointment, desiring a local man, as is customary. They threaten to petition Tehran and if that has no result to emigrate from Mazinan. 2 . It has been suggested to the Governor-General by Musaddik-ud-Daulah, the Rais-i-Nazmiah, through M. Nicolsky, that Mudabbir-ul-Mulk, whom Kamran Mirza brought to Meshed for appointment as Rais-i-Nazmiah, should be deported to Tehran as he is intriguing against him. Kamran demurs to this and proposes to give the Mudabbir some other appointment to keep him quiet. I think this course is quite sufficient and have arranged accordingly with my colleague. 3 . Persian affairs. —Mutual recriminations between the Chief of Bujnurd and Shuja-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan, on the subject of Khuddu,the robber chief, continue; and each has again reported the other to Tehran for obstructing his efforts. Meanwhile Khuddu has escaped into Russian territory near Sarakhs where he was apparently helped by the Governor on condition that no raid be committed on his village. 4 . The Governor-General has denied to Tehran that he is interfering with the regular courts of justice in Meshed (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 15 ). 5 . The conduct of Najd-us-Saltanah, the PeshJcar-i-Maliyah, in connection with the grain scarcity, is most unsatisfactory. Not only has he been obstructive in regard to the export of 5,000 kharwars to Russian Turkistan, for which sanction was duly given by Government (paragraph 7 last week) but it is now found that he was engaged in a plot to buy up large stores of Government grain at Tumans 18 per kharwar and sell it later at 23 , and had other schemes for increasing local distress for his own benefit. My colleague and I have recommended his recall. The Prime Minister has telegraphed to a local leading mvjtahid urging that the export of grain to Russia as sanctioned by him should not be opposed here, and pointing out the necessity of maintaining friendly relations with Russia. He adds that the Russian Legation has been asked to requisition the smallest possible amount on account of local scarcity. 6. It having been found impossible this year to arrange a contract for the Meshed-Gunabad post, the Postmaster-General has proposed a scheme of his own for the purchase of carts, phaetons and horses, and has submitted a budget amounting to Tumans 13 , 000 . 7 . British affairs. —Three recruiting parties have arrived this week from India. Owing largely to the unemployment caused by lack of rainfall this year many Hazaras are coming up for enlistment. 8. Russian affairs.—Some trouble has arisen on account of the purchase by Abdullah, the Russian Tajir Bashi, of a piece of land outside one of the city gates, which was formerly a burial ground, as the site of a caravanserai. 9 . A dispute took place on the 26 th instant between the Bukhara Tajir Bashi (a Russian subject) and the Mutawalli-Bashi over the supply of water for the latter’s garden. The Tajir-Bashi was somewhat roughly handled by the Mutwalli’s employes. It is said that fear of the Russians on the part of the local people has decreased on account of the recent political changes in Russia. 10 . Persian and German Intrigues. —Some dissatisfaction was expressed at the weekly meeting of local democrats on account of the delay which the Prime Minister is shewing in regard to the election of a national representative assembly. It was decided to arrange for the publication of strong articles in the local newspapers, notably the “ Chaman. ” 11 . News from Turhat-i-Haidar i. —Ref erring to paragraph 11 last week it seems to have been (rightly) decided at Tehran that the Dragoman’s son is to be regarded as a Persian subject as regards his bad conduct in the incident in question, but the case has not yet been settled.r-r- ■ 12 It is said that M. Mikhailoff will come shortly to Meshed, but I hear that he is trying to avoid service at Barfarush to which he had been transferred He has no one’s permission to remain indefinitely at Turbat, which he is apparently doing. ,o News from Turbat-i-Shaihh Jam.—Having heard that M. Lemansky had made a fals &gt; report to Colonel Scouratt regarding my dealings with the Ilbaigi Kaudani 1 called on Scouratt on the 25 th and could not have come at a better time asa sPco'd report traducing both me and Shaji-us-Saltanah had just arrived. After a friendly interview Colonel Scouratt announced his intention of accepting Lemansky’s resignation as soon as possible. T V„ v „ been obliged however to write Shaji a strong letter urging him to behave nuietlv and to recognise the authority of the Governor-General, a recent messenger of whom’ conveying instructions in a civil case, he is said to have treated with d sdain ’ M Nicolsky at my request has also obtained a promise from Kamraa Mlrpa that Shaii is to continue in office, and I trust he will not make it impossible te us to retShim in his position (paragraph 12 of Diary No. 15 ). 14 News from Kam.-Our agent hears that a supposed Turk upon whom an assortment of printed matter was found has been arrested by Afghans in Kafir K ,, Ovr agent has visited Shaikh Jam during the week and has conferred with Shaii-us-Sultanah regarding the matter referred to in paragraph 23 below. Shaji is sending out the necessary instructions to his men. Ifi News from Herah—Orders have been received by the Nmb-id-Hukumah from the Muin-us-Sultanah (son of the Naib-us-Saltanah) for the reorganisation of the Khatmnin sowars and their conversion into a form of regular troops. 17 . The despatch to Kabul of 22 lakhs of krans is reported. 18 . Distress on account of lack of water is said to be increasing. 19 . The Mehmandar of the Bagh-i-Kertah has incurred the displeasure of the Naib-vl-Hukumah on account of too assiduous attention to the requirements of his gUe 20. Wagner himself brought some horses and mules to the Chahar Shambah bazar for sale on the 15 th instant (paragraph 22, last week), but found no pur- chasers. 21 . Nasrullah, Wagner’s servant, was recounting in the bazar on the 15 th,. various atrocities supposed to have been perpetrated by the Russians in Bokhara and elsewhere, when he was interrupted by a Kandahan who stated that he had just returned from those parts and could swear that no such events had occurred. 22 . Bayerl was asked on 16 th why they were desirous of selling their horses, and whether they did not now wish to leave Herat. He replied that as the Russians were now making peace the war would soon terminate : that they would then return to their homes via Russian railways and would have no need of animals. 23 . Ahmad Barbari (paragraph 17 of Diary No. 6 cetera) upon release by us apparently returned to Herat, where he stated that he had escaped from confine ment here. It is reported that Wagner is annoyed with him for not bringing any information, but a later communication from our Herat agent, received yesterday, intimates that he is again employing him in connection with the mission of Saiyid Husain bin Saiyid Rahim (paragraph 14 , last week, and previous reports). It is said to have been arranged that Saiyid Husain, who after being detained for a few days outside the city of Herat left on the 21st, should meet Ahmad (who quitted Herat on 22nd) in or near Meshed, and hand to him Tumans 50 there for delivery with documents for Tehran to one Abdur Rahman who will then proceed to Tehran. Sowars have been posted and it is hoped that these men may be intercepted. We have not yet succeeded n establishing the identity of this Abdur Rahman. 24 . The Naib-ul-HuJcumah h&amp;s given orders for Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat Ullah to be removed from Chahar Bagh and accommodated in the town. 25 . Condition of the country. —A marauding party from Russian territory have killed one Aziz Khan near Sarakhs and carried off his mare. 26 .

The Persian Government has recently accepted the bid of three younger brothers of the late Mujtehid, Mullah Mehdi, for the farm of the villages which the two eldest surviving brothers have succeeded to in conjunction with the priestly othce. It is rumoured that the Revenue Minister at Tehran contemplates enhancing all the farmers’ contracts and extracting at least 5,000 kharwars of grain more out of the district annually.

The three Turks mentioned in Diary No. 14 are now described by one reporter as “a German Consul with two servants,” and by another as “ a German with three Afghan guards and a cook.” This party has been at Khash and Halili. News from Jali Robat (in Afghanistan) received via Koh Kalik Siah indicates that a party of “ Germans ” had gone as far south as the SLela near Gaud-i-Zirreh on about the 8th April, but had returned to Chahar Burjak, despairing of being able to slip through our cordon. Gun Runners. I hear several rumours of small parties of Afghans who are about to proceed to the coast to buy rifles and slave-girls. Some of the officials of Chakhansur are said to be sleeping partners in these enterprises. The Governor at present is refusing to encourage them. The Khidri Robbery Case. See Diary No. 1. The Governor of Herat has refused to let the emissaries from Shaukat-ul-Mulk and Hisam-ud-Dauleh cross the border at Yazdan in order to interview him at Herat. He has written that he has instituted enquiries himself •at Ispezar and that when the facts have been ascertained the various claimants will be sent for to svrear about the extent of their losses.

It appears that at the last named place he possesses culturable land which is irrigated partly from karezes starting from across the border and on which in the past he or his ancestors have spent a good deal of money. He proposed now to improve the water-supply further but met with some opposition from Afghan sowars who live at Yazdan and apparently regard the place as in Afghan territory. Russian Affairs. A cavalry spy employed by the British officer commanding at Bandan recently arrested a suspicious character at Duroh who thereupon claimed to he a secret news-agent of the Eussian Vice-Consul at Birjand. M. Boulatoff on hearing the news protested very strongly toVice-Consul Brenan. It has now been arranged that both Vice-Consuls shall reciprocally communicate to each other the identity and whereabouts of the secret service agents working for their respective Govern ments in Kainat. Persian Government t Sowars. A rather serious/rums occurred at Tabasain near Bandan on the 22nd instant between Baluch camel sowars under the Deputy Governor of Sistan and a Sistani tribe of maldars, owing to the former commandeering four sheep from the latter without payment on their way past the encampment. After six men had been wounded both parties ran into Bandan and complained against each other before Lieutenant Adams who commands at that post. Their leaders subsequently came into Sistan with the wounded men. The jambazes have relations in the Sistan Levy Corps, while the maldars supply camels freely to our local transport con tractor. In the subsequent enquiry, the jambazes were reprimanded and the maldars were pardoned, thanks to the good offices extended to them by the Con sulate. Baluch Raiders. On the 21st April news reached Sistan from Kerman that the two notorious raiders Wali Muhammad Sherdil (see Diary No. 44 of 1915) and Juma Bahadur Shali-bur (see Diary No. 1 of 1915) were out with lashkars —the first against Narmashir and the second against Khabis or possibly Kainat. It has subsequently transpired that only Wali Muhammad has been raiding, instigated thereto by Sardar Bahram Khan who has recently suffered at the hands of Sardar Nawab Khan. Wali Muhammad is believed now to have returned to Bampur, The Indo-European Telegraph Department. Ali Shah Khan, the notorious ez-subsidized headman of sowars protecting the telegraph line in the 7th Sub-Section, has come into Sistan in T response to i; 1; C L'G • INDIA FOREIGN E I SECR \ No. 3 9 Letter.

(1) The German at Kala Kang is said to have sent a letter to Neh on about the 22nd April by the hand of one Mulla Hasan, son of Gul Muhammad Kashani of Deh Ali Khan in Chakhansur. The addressee's name is given as Haji Ghulam. Lieutenant Matthews has examined two residents of Neh, bearing this name, but has not discovered anything suspicious about them. (2) The German, it is -said, proposed repairing the fort at Nad-i-Ali, but has not been allowed by the Governor to do so. It is believed that he will shortly leave for Farah and Herat. Gun Runners. See Diary No. 13. Lieutenant McManus, in a recent visit to Labi Baring, heard from maldars that a small party of Afghan gun-runners who had lost their rifles had travelled along the edge of the Hamun into Afghanistan. It seem certain that this party was the second half of the band attacked by Captain Kreyer last March. At that time there was only a Persian Government detachment of camel sowars stationed at Baring, ostensibly co-operating with us, and a Levy Corps news-writer who never reported anything. The Harvest Prospects. Some apprehensions have been felt in Birjand owing to the lack of rain and an apparent tendency on the part of merchants to corner the grain supply. It is not believed that an actual shortage of wheat exists. The Governor, Shaukat- ul-Mulk, convened a meeting of merchants and bakers on the 22nd instant to arrange for a proper supply of bread in the town and a second meeting will be held shortly. It is proposed that the price of bread be fixed for the next seven months at one leran per Kaini man. F. B. PBIDEAUX, Lieutenant-Colonel, H. B. M. ’s Consul for Sistan and Rain. * G. M. Press, Simla.-No. C.S6F.D.—16-5-17—30— M.D.SECRET. — ... - V Intelligence Summary, No. 11, for the week ending, the' 17th March 1917. KHORASAN AND N. E. PERSIA.- ' vay Wl 136. Russian force. According to'private information which has reached the Russians, General Madritov’s force decisively defeated the Yomud Turkoman on the Atrek oh January 9 th and January 12th or 13th. These dates coincide with the rumours noted in Infelligenhe Summaries 3- and 4. From the tone of these communications' it appeals to be faitly certain that any prospect of further serious lurkdman resistance is at abend as the principal Khans had tendered their submission. General Madritov, who subsequently returned to' Tashkent* is again reported to be in the Astrabad region, and to be supervising the e’tfH barkation of the troops for Enzeli, whence, it is supposed, they will be sent to reinforce the Russian front in N. W. Persia. At the same time no official news of these proceedings has been vouchsafed to the Russians, civil or military, and it is supposed that the heavy loss inflicted on the Turkoman may be the reason of tne discretion observed. General Loginov's appointment to the Astrabad region appears to have been cancelled, as according to latest advices he was still at Tashkent.- 137. Persian Cossack Brigade.— The Adjutant of the Khorasan Division of this formation, Captain Sergieev, states that during the current year it is pro v posed to limit Jocal enlistment to 150 savars and 600 infantry. The savars are taken with their own horses, and it is only proposed to resort to purchase in the comparatively rare cases when suitable man are unprovided with mounts. He asked whether there was any objection to Barbaris being enlisted “ as they were' under British protection, ” and was informed of the Consul-General’s reply to the Barbari elders noted in Meshed Diary Number 9. Their present require ments from this tribe are only about 40 men, as they intend as far as possible tb form their contingent from men of every suitable local race. The report as to' the proposed enlistment of the Nardin savars as a whole appears to lack found ation. Colonel MamonOv was expected on the )8th instant, but as a telegram has just been received from him from his home in Russia it is evident that his arrival will be considerably delayed. 138. Enemy Agents. —Information has been received that one Hajji Sheikh Mehdi of Yazd, who acted as a German agent in 1915, continues to serve as a medium for secret communication for the Germans. The arrival here from Tehran via Transcaspia of one Hassan Agha, stated to be a German agent of some ability, is expected- Necessary action has been taken in both cases. 139. Frontier Custom*.— Persian CuStbms officials at Pul-i-Khatun and Sarakhs have been discharged.- Regarding the former, reports reached me that he was assisting the arms traffic and the passage of secret messengers to Afghanistan which I communicated ttf the Provincial Director of Customs^ The jatter stated that the man had several times protested against transfer from Pul- i-Khatun to, on the face of it, a better appointment which he considered suspi cious and he subsequently detailed an inspector to carry out investigations in that quarter. &amp; HERAT AND AFGHANfSTAN. 140. Germans and adherents.—k letter was recently handed to Wagner by a man in Afghan dresss who subsequently disappeared, and who, in spite of anxious search by Wagner and his men, could not be fouhd. Wagner is making excuses to' prevent the young ' German ' whose arrival at Herlt was noted recently, from being despatched (o Kabul. , Pack saddled of the German party have been sent to the Mistn Khana for repair. 141 . Herat Inspite of the weeding-out of last year the predomi nance of elderly men in! the ranks of the infantry and artillery is causing the Naih * ’' Ifi 12 Salar some embankment. The Commandants of battalions have drafted the old men into two companies out of the 6, and these companies are given lighter work. This expedient is obviously a makeshifft, and another proposal to form the Kotwali battalion of such men was considered and rejected. The Naib Salar finally decided that, in view of the unfitness of many of the older men for any hard work, all doubtful cases should be brought before the medical officers. On the 6th instant ioo men of the Infantry and artillery were discharged as unfit after medical inspection. The practice has, however, opened the door to malin gering on the part of men who although not physically unfit, yet find the hard work of the present rbgime little to their taste. It was finally decided that such men should be examined ; those unfit, to be discharged, and men fit for further service held till they can produce an able-bodied substitute in their place. All this, however, does not.make for the prospective strengthening of the Herat garrison. 142. Cavalry recruiting—In reply to his enquiries that whereas formerly men were willing to pay specially for enlistment in the cavalry, no recruits were now coming forward, the Naib Salar was informed that the cause was two-fold ; (a) the obligation to produce 1000 krans for a horse, (b) increase of work. With a view to remedying the first-named the Naib Salar substituted the condition that the horse provided by the recruit should be of suitable stamp and strength, but attached no condition as to the price to ^ be paid. 16 recruits were obtained shortly after the withdrawal of price restriction. 143. Training. —Infantry companies are being exercised in hill work on the outskirts of the Maulvi Jam hills. 144. Ghor. — A report has been received from the officer in command at Ghor that suitable accommodation for guns has now been provided, and it is ex pected that 4 guns will shortly be sent from Herat. RUSSIAN TURKISTAN. 145. Military service. —A special local Commission has been convened to consider the question of exemption from active military service granted to em ployes of the Central Asian Railway. 146. Turkoman.—According to the local press a special ^ commission is sitting at Gunbad-i-Kabuz to determine the amount of confiscations to be in flicted on the rebellious Yomud Turkoman. The confiscation of all horses and half the number of tents is proposed. 4000 camels have been taken and a very large number of sheep, of which 15,000 have been despatched to Hassan Quli for the preparation of preserved meat.

KHORASAN AND NORTH EAST PERSIA. mi t dills !!■ mveidto :d to ei to lie b I 47 - Russian force .—The Russian staff have now received official notifica tion from the Head-quarters of the Turkistan Military District at Tashkent that the operations of the Gurgan force are completed, some of the rebellions Yomud Khans having been captured and others having voluntarily surrendered. General Madritov was despatching i Cossack regiment and 4 infantry battalions to reinforce General Baratov in North-West Persia, and the remainder of the force (Reference paragraph 86 ot 1916) is retained ror the present on the Gurgan on the line Ak Kala, Gunbad-i-Kabus, Morava Tapa. No mention is made in this communication of artillery but if it has been retained in tpto it would appear somewhat excessive to the proportion of other arms on the spot. It is evident that paragraph 146—the only allusion to the subject which has appeared in the Press—can be read in conjunction with the above. On the evening of the 22nd instant a telegram was received from Tashkent enjoining the celebration of a general holiday on the following day in honour of the attainment of the freedom of Russia, together with a religious service and march past of the troops. The proceedings were conducted soberly in the conventional manner. While welcoming the prospect of greater efficiency in carrying on the war, the officers are impressed with the magnitude of the change which has come upon them so suddenly, and are not altogether without apprehen sion of internal difficulties in the future. 148. Canards.—k§ might be expected the Russian nevs has given great scope to the imaginations of local democrats and others interested in the success of our enemies. A separate peace on the part of Russia, followed by her active participation in the war on the side of Germany, is a favourite variant, and as under these circumstances the Turks are under no necessity to carry on further hostilities with the Russians, the withdrawal of the Turkish forces from Kerman- shah is explained in the most natural and logical manner possible. A rumour of the reoccupation of Baghdad by the Turkish troops is said to emanate from the Russian tajir-bashi. HERAT AND AFGHANISTAN. M 0 14Q. Germans and adherents .—The fact thatWagner’s transport has lately been well fed with barley, and is regularly exercised, coupled with his purchase of several pairs of country shoes and other articles suitable for the road, and steps to procure Turkoman guides, is taken at Herat as confirmation of insist ent rumours of the proximate departure of the German party, either towards Persia or Russia. On the other hand he is reported to be arranging for the despatch of a letter to Tehran and for the receipt of an answer, and it is also possible that the news of the capture of Baghdad and Kermanshah, which should have reached Herat on the 18th instant may induce a change of plan. In any case the Russians and all concerned have been warned. /50. Recruiting .—The Naib Salar has given orders for lists of the male population of the 9 buluks of Herat to be prepared with a view to enforcing the conscription of 1 man in 8. He is also considering the possibility of inducing desirable men now serving as substitutes for soldiers on leave to enlist permanently on the return of those whom they are replacing. He has detailed a Major of the Kandahari infantry battalion to proceed to Kandahar and there to select promising recruits on the 1 per 8 basis for service in the above battalion at Herat, and has furthermore announced his intention of writing to Kabul for recruits thence for the Herat Kabuli battalion. From these measures it would appear that the local sources of recruits are disappointing. l Gil ■ ; 'An Lei Be Go. iil 3 5 4 MAY IQiy JUfj 19'/7 1 Q ~*-o&gt; i * A V li i J 1 '•V 8266053/ &lt;/ Discharges.— ^number of soldiers are reported to have been discharged as old or unfit from the Herat garrison during the second week of March. ,,, Training. —One company each of the Khaki and Ghaznichi battalions took Dart in a field-day with blank ammunition outside the city. The Naib Salar and the Naib-ul-Hukumat were present and are reported to have been satisfied with the proficiency displayed. A field and a mountain battery recently carried out gunnery practice. One hit out of 30 rounds was scored, which resulted in a stricture on the part of the Artillery Colonel of the poor range taking and observation of fire displayed by the personnel. Cavalry sowars have been practicing lance exercise since the 8th instant. Some 200 signallers are engaged in daily practice. Regular parade hours are for infantry from 7 AM. to 11 A.M.; for artillery from 6 A.M. to 2 P.M. Officers attend special instructional parades from 3 to 5 P-M. In addressing his men the Colonel commanding the artillery stated that it was regrettable that the men found the present hours arduous, as after Nau Ruz both day and night work would be much increased, and the men would not see their homes for 3 months. 7 ro Bells of arms. —Instructions have been given for the preparation of sDecial rooms in the cavalry lines, fitted with racks and padlocked chains, in which the rifles of the sowars are to be kept under guard at all times except when issued for parades or other duties. 154 Financial.— The Amin-i-Nizam (head clerk) requested the Naib Salar to furnish him with the budget estimate for the new year received from Kabul in order that he might prepare the military payrolls. He was ordered first to settle the payments of the last two months of the current year ; on completion of this instructions for the new year (from March 21st) would be issued. He was also cautioned against making advances of pay, and warned that any advances made to men who subsequently deserted would be recoverable from him. 1 Mazar-i-Sharif .—An agent who left Mazar at the beginning of the last week in February asserts positively that Mohendro Partap was there when he left, and that no reports of his approaching departure were current. The strength of the garrison is given as follows : Infantry .—4 battalions, nominally 600 strong each, but in each case 50 to 80 men under strength— 1. Herati battalion. 2. Kandahari do. 3. Kabuli do. 4. Kohistani do. The Khasadars of the district numbering 10 flags or some 1000 men have been amalgamated in the above battalions, but even with their addition the total does not exceed the amount stated. All were armed with Martini Henry rifles with the exception of the Kanda hari battalion, 520 strong, to w’hom the new magazine rifles had been issued. (Agent had not seen the rifle in question, but states that it is the 11-shot Lee Enfield of Kabul make.) Cavalry .—4 complete regiments, approximately 400 strong each. In addi tion 2 squadrons, or 18 squadrons in all. 170 khawanin savars have been amalgamated in these. Khawanin .—Number 15 flags of 100 men each, of whom 5 flags are at Kabul, and the remainder employed on various duties in the Mazar district.The cavalry were all armed with Martinis, the intention to arm one regiment with magazine rifles not having yet been carried out. 1000 rounds per magazine rifle received from Kabul are said to be in stock. Artillery*—\ batteries of ioo men each. Batteries said to be armed with 6 breech-loading guns each, known as “ German ” guns. These are said to be mountain guns somewhat longer than the old pattern. In addition one maxim battery of 6 maxims. Old pattern guns, withdrawn from the troops and stored (or perhaps mount ed on the defences of Dehdadi) are Field-guns ... Mountain guns Heavy guns Daily training of the troops is being carried out with somewhat and care than formerly. 36 36 3 more zeal No recruits on the 1 per 8 basis have as yet been conscripted at Mazar. The people are reported to be attending to their daily business, paying little attention to the war or to war rumours. If approached to furnish recruits at 1 per 8 males they are disposed to resist the exaction, their attitude being that if no Jihad is in question there is no necessity for it. If, on the other hand, Jihad be declared all able bodied men will be ready to come forward. RUSSIAN TURKISTAN. 1 $6. Change of Government* The issue of the 17th instant, of the paper “ Askhabad ” contains the first mention of recent events in Russia, in a guarded article noting the assumption of the Government by the Committee of the Duma, in which no mention of the Tsar is made. For the 4 previous days no telegrams had been passed to the paper by the General Staff. The news of the change of regime was quietly received at Askhabad. 757. War loan* 3,884,600 rubles have been contributed by Transcaspia tc/vards the last 5J per cent Russian war loan. Ig8. Quarantine precautions* In consequence of the notice from Baku Military authorities of the presence of typhus among soldiers being evacuated to Transcaspia, steamers arriving at Krasnovodsk with troops from Baku are first calling at Ufa, for medical inspection and other necessary action. 759. Disorders. 35 Turkomans of the Sarakhs district have been tried by military court at Askhabad for participation in disorders in connection with the military labour scheme. 5 were sentenced to be hanged, 12 to penal servitude and imprisonment and the remainder acquitted. 160. Prisoners of war. The Tashkent town-council has taken exception to the scale of diet for officer prisoners of war at Tashkent, which they consider both unduly abundant at a time of scarcity like the present, and also^to contain articles of the nature of luxuries. The orderlies of these officers make purchases freely at all shops, and the institution of a special shop to which such prisoners shall be limited is under consideration. 161* Russo-Persian f r ontier. According to reports from Persian Sarakhs the Russians have purchased 10,000 kharwars of wheat from that neighbourhood. Raids of camels and sheep belonging to Baluch owners have been made by robbers from inhabitants of this locality. Reports from Tejend state that Baluchis grazing their animals in Russian territory have been prohibited from re-exporting them, and that they are to be requisitioned, 110 rubles being paid per camel and 10 rubles per sheep. E. A. F. REDL, Lieutenant-Colonel t G. S. 0 . MESHED' 24 th March 1917 . S366GSB—35—27 4*17—GCSP SimlaSECRET. 13 p 450 I9IT a (o Intelligence Summary No. ISTfor the week ending the 31st March 1917. Khorasan and N. E. Per5?:a. . JluMwn force ,—The Russian staff have received a telesrram direct rom me otaff of General Madriton’s force, saying that all is now quiet in the Gurgan region. It contains no information that was not previously known but confirms the confiscations noted in paragraph 146. An alarmist telegram was received from the Military District Headquar* ^ers, ^Tashkent, during the week, concerning Afghan intentions hostile to Russia, orders for the repair of roads leading to the Russian frontier, and .collection of a dep 6 t of stores at Zulfiqar. An identical telegram was apparent ly sent to Russian Consular officers in Persia which caused them some un easiness. It is a regrettable fact that Tashkent is excessively alarmist, and that they spread far and wide rumours collected by a faulty intelligence orga nisation. This fact is fully recognised by the military staff here, nor does it appear to he confined to them only, as, about a year ago at Petrograd M. Sazonov communicated to me the text of an even more alarming Afghan rumour receiv ed from Tashkent with the remark “I do not pay much attention to it as Tashkent is always sensational, but as a precaution I am sending it to our Consul General in India for verification/’ An answer was Subsequently receiv- ed from the latter that there was no foundation for the reports given. 163. Canards.—A most circumstantial report has reached the Russian staff of serious fighting in the Sarhad region in which Jehind, Bahram Khan, and other Baluch chiefs took the lead causing the loss of 3 British and several Native Officers as well as 150 men to our troops. Reinforcements sent were said to have been heavily engaged. Owing to the names given it is evi* dent that these rumours must be set going by someone with considerable local knowledge, and it would be_interesting to discover who that person may be. A report current here that Russian soldiers and Cossacks have been indulg ing in a free fight over constitutional matters and that steps have been taken to confiscate their arms is totally_ devoid of foundation. Herat and Afghanistan. 164. Germans and adherents .—news of the capture of Baghdad and Kermanshah which reached Herat on the 17th instant appears, in spite of a half-hearted attempt at denial on their part, to have caused Wagner and Kazim Beg a bad quarter of an hour. There was for the moment no further talk of departure. With reference to reports of &lt;{ Germans’* in various places, the Agent states that according to his information no member of the German party aras missing from the Bagh-i-Karta. Reports have been received at Herat confirmatory of the continued presence of Mohendro Partap at Mazar-i-Sharif. As an apostle of freedom he may per haps be encouraged by recent events in Russia to renew his efforts for a safe- conduct. 165. Artillery .—Further firing was carried out near the Maulvi Jam hills in the presence of the Naib Salar by 2 field and 3 mountain guns. As none of the 7 or 8 rounds fired by each gun found the mark, the Naib Salar ordered that the guns being obviously unserviceable, they should be withdrawn from the troops. The Artillery Colonel subsequently reported that the fault appeared to lie with the powder charge, one seer in excess of the proper charge having been used on this occasion, and recommended that the gun? be carefully examined before final condemnation, i i ■ ft. A r i Le, _ ha Led JRetiKjv- -E j\, F0 mn sec.;. 1 ‘°- 37. a 34 JUN 1917He also proposed to utilise the Taimani recruits to complete artillery sadres but was told to wait till the Naib Salar had “ sized ” the men of an infantry battalion, after which operation there would probably he enough men of out sizes available for him. 166. Infantry .—The O. C., Kandahari battalion reported his unit 100 short of the full complement, and protested on this ground against dismissing ^ 100 men on the score of age, many of whom in spite of their white beards were quite fit for service. It was decided to retain as many of the old men as still seemed fit for service. 167. Signallers .—26 men of the signalling class have been promoted after examination to non-commissioned rank. On ordering the promotion the Naib Salar remarked that although they were now extra to establishment, the forth coming conscription on the 1 per 8 basis would shortly enable* them to be absorbed. 168. Reported despatch.—On the authority of the Naib Salar, 3 maxims have been despatched from Kabul for Herat. It is also reported that 1,200 recruits have left the capital for inclusion in the Herat garrison. Cloth for uniforms has reached Maimana, whither, also, guns from Kabul are reported to be en route. 169. Mnzar-i-Sharif.—With, reference to the artillery of the garrison there are said to be 21 guns in all of the new breech-loading pattern, which are distributed among the I batteries. The maxim battery for which the personnel at present numbers 85 men is in excess to the aboye. Russian Tukkistan. 170. The new order .—At a general parade at Tashkent on the 18th instant General Kuropatkin announced the change of Government, and after causing the manifesto of the Tsar and other documents to be read, called on all to support the new Government. On the conclusion of the proceedings he addressed the native deputation present, calling on the senior deputy to inform his fellow countrymen of what he had heard and seen. Military officers, active and retired, subsequently passed a resolution to adhere to the new Government. Executive committees have been formed at Tashkent and Askbabad to assist in the internal direction of affairs, the questions of supplies, and other necessities of the moment. At the latter place they seem to have superseded to a great extent the functions of the Governor. A member of the Duma has been deputed to Tashkent to assist General Kuropatkin. As lar as can be judged at present matters have been going smoothly throug out the country, although certain knotty questions seem likely to arise. One of the first acts of the Askhabad executive committee was to declare the police dismissed. The provision of an alternative force, however, was less easy, and after rejecting in turn proposals to employ militia, old or wounded soldiers, and schoolboys of the senior classes in that capacity, the retention of the previous personnel, who had declared adherence to the popular cause, un er a ommissary of the Committee was decided on as a temporary measure. r ^ f sca P ia » a l so &gt; committees of soldiers at the principal garrisons have n orme w o occupy themselves with various matters of interior economy, en procee mgs emg modelled on the procedure of higher legislative bodies, successive questions being “ heard' and “ resolved. ” As a sample, at a recent meeting it was resolved to request the O. C. 5th Siberian Reserve Regi men o renew is application for boots for the detachment at Krasnovodsk to express sympathy with certain officers who had been abused by a drunken soldier, an to request that the offender be punished ; to express regret at the s ovenly manner in which some soldiers saluted, and to take steps to bring the r °! i u M r ter ? f . War t0 tlie ^tention of all concerned. In the opinion o t ie staff here the institution of soldiers committees is not justified by anyite %i 5^ /, n k 3 Sal ar, ( too, il^» ijiaiiMau,] MS [rtP® '( order hitherto received, is attributable to the weakness of the military authori- relaxefarrffid at^esent . 40 diSCipline “ rep ° rted t0 be re S rettabI y 4 - Kizi1 tlie officers were called upon to state whether they adhered to me present Government as the men would refuse to obey the order of any officer not so adhering. The workmens delagates there also impressed on the soldiers the necessity of bringing up for discussion orders given by the officers before carrying thmn out, but this recommendation appears to have received scant attention. Kizil Arvat, the headquarters of the former Railway Batta- hon, has for many years been a focus of revolutionary propaganda: some difficulty might therefore be anticipated there, nor can very high ideas of discipline be expected in Turkistan at present with a garrison practically n C ° mp ° Sed 0 ^ 1 milltia units - Cossacks of the regiment here approached the O.

The most absurd rumours were said to be current in consequence. On the change of Government an order was immediately issued that no death sentences passed by military courts were to be carried out till further notice. These passed in connection with the native disorders have since been cancelled, as also have sentences of penal servitude or imprisonment inflicted on this count. They are declared to have occurred as a direct consequence of tbe order^oHast June enjoining native conscription of labour which should this order. The whole of these incidents are to be treated'as if they had never occurred. While much justification of this view exists it will be difficult for the Russian population—of Semirechia in particular where several thousands of Russians perished—to pass the sponge over this page. Presumably also the logical consequence of the new decision will be the restoration of lands confiscated and possibly by now in other hands—a process which may involve some difficulties. xuc xuri/uci uespawm ui nauve worKmen tor laoour m rear of tbe armies has been prohibited, and arrangements for the repatriation of those already in Russia ordered. Une may perhaps also expect a remission, if not a cancellation, of the severe orders for the confiscation of the live-stock of the rebellious Yomud Turkoman, but hitherto there has been no mention of this. Meshed ; 3Ut March E. A. R. REEL, Lieutenant*Colonel, G.

Persian affairs. —In continuation of paragraph 10 last week Nusrat-ul- Mulk has telegraphed to the Wazir-i-Maliyah that his Taimuris have regularly paid the revenue due from them and that he is sending an agent to Tehran to explain. In the event of the agent’s explanation being considered unsatisfactory Nusrat will submit to any orders the Government may give. 2. With reference to paragraph 8 last week it is now reported that the Mutwalli Bashi has made friends with the local democrats and on their advice has declined to attend the first meeting of the committee assembled to settle the difficulties between him and the Shrine officials. The latter have again telegraphed to Tehran in protest against the delay, for which inaction on the part of the Mutwalli is responsible, and the Kaim Mukam talks of going himself to Tehran to prove his case against him. 3. The present Governor-General has opened a court of justice of his own similar to that instituted by Nasir-ud-DinMirza (paragraph 9 of Diary No. 42 last year) and the Rais-i-Adliyah has protested as before against the usurpation of his prerogatives. 4. Russian affairs. —The Khorassan spring rains have not yet fallen and serious famine is threatened. The export of grain to Russian territory {vide paragraph 10 of Diary No. 13 and previous reports) is becoming a serious question: the Russians needing it more than ever and the reasons for disinclination to export on the part of Persians becoming more real and definite. The newspapers are protesting against export and a deputation of local traders has been sympathetically received by the Governor-General, who is discussing the matter with M. Nicolsky. Meanwhile a member of the Askabad Executive Committee with a Russian officer has arrived in Meshed in connection with the purchase of grain and the export of the 5,000 kharwars originally sanctioned will probably be arranged, though in regard to further consignments there may be difficulties. 5. The prohibition of the export of dried fruits to Russia has been rescinded. 6. The Russian Consul-General is reported to be displeased with the Head of the Excise Department for obstructing the export of opium to Russia. 7. On the afternoon of the 13th instant a conflict occurred in the town between three Persian Cossacks and some local Russian subjects in which one of the latter was severely wounded, 8. Persia and German Intrigues. —At a secret meeting of democrats it has been decided to follow the action of the Tehran committee in sending congratulations to the provisional Russian Government, and to write suitable letters both to them and to the “ Caucasus M orkmen’s Society. 9. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—U. Antipoff was accorded the usual ceremo nial reception on the 1st instant at Zia-ud-Din near Turbot. Some delay has occurred in his returning official visits as M. Mikhailoff appears not yet to have handed over charge. 10. The son of Mirza Muhsin Khan (Russian Consulate dragoman), a person of indifferent character, fired a revolver at the Rais-i-Maliyah, who ordered his men to confiscate the weapon and beat the youth ; closing his office as a protest against the outrage. M. Mikhailoff is reported to have interfered on behalf of his protege, and the Governor to have supported the Rais-i-Maliyah, who is sending an account of the incident to his Meshed superior. 11. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—I arrived here on the 7th instant and was cordially received by Shaji-us-Saltanah. An interview with the llbaigi, which took place on the 8th, was arranged at Kalatah-i-Ismail Khan, a hamlet some ten miles ofi the Jam-Karez road, where he has a residence. DM I. f n * \i M2 Tig, j rr. liikh tuj * i r i P ,fl;' ^ f; I 1 j t ; ■ ;■ p / U { Uki, i tl -' [' ' I? -Mr tlphl;! r Pr Ml rr ii! 1 !# I last year was accomplished by an act of treachery which has had the natural result of destroying his confidence in Europeans ; and he would only meet me on ground and in circumstances entirely favourable to himself. A long discussion took place and eventually I accepted his promises of future good conduct and gave him a letter to M 4 Antipoff at Turbat with one of safe conduct, according to the arrangement made in Meshed before the new Russian Vice-Consul left for his post. A separate report will be submitted on this matter* 12. The authority of Shaji-us-Saltanah seems to be popular among his people and his regard for us leaves nothing to be desired ; but I have some doubt as to the future as he is young and headstrongjand will require more watchful control of the right kind than he is likely to receive in present circumstances. 13; News from Karez. —I spent the 10th at Karez and interviewed Shuja-ul- Mulk and others at great length on the subject of the sowar difficulty (paragraph 24, last week and former reports). It is somewhat complicated owing to having remained unsettled for four years, but will now be taken up with the Maliyah here and the result reported in due course. 14. Shuja-ul-Mulk was very secretive on the subject of the Ilbaigi and time did not allow of his confidence being gained but this will come in time. It is not surprising that he too should be suspicious, having been for so long under the com bined influence of M. Popoff and Mirza Hasan Khan. Our new agent, Khan Sahib Allah Din, seems to be doing satisfactorily. 15; I left Karez on the 11th, arriving at Meshed on the 13th. 16. News from Herat .—One hundred and twenty camel-loads of merchandise have reached Herat from Penjdeh which include 50 loads of iron, the export of which from Russia is prohibited* 17; One hundred camel-loads of sugar, received ’from Kandahar, have been despatched to Meshed. As a result of a protest made to the Naib-ul-Huhimah against this export the merchants responsible appear to have replied that at least two years’ supply was in stock at Herat. 18. The Khawanin sowars sent to trace the thieves in the Badghist robbery reported in paragraph 18 of Diary No. 13 have returned with four prisoners. 19. Wagner accompanied by some Austrians visited the village of Siah Washan, some 10 miles south of Herat, on the 30th ultimo. Some dispute occurred and the escorting sowars with difficulty restrained the local people from assaulting the visitors. When reporting the matter to the Mehmandar of Bagh-i-Kertah, on return, the head of the escort remarked that the guests had themselves given offence to the villagers and were solely responsible. 20. The Naib-ul-Huhjtmah is said to have received a letter from Abdullah Khan, the Afghan Agent at Meshed, saying that Russia had made peace with Turkey, Russian troops had withdrawn from Meshed and Baghdad had been re captured by the Turks. This has given pleasure to Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat Ullah, who seem to have believed it, but Bayerl has apparently not done so, as he is enquiring anxiously for Meshedis who will give him the latest news from thence. 21. Haji Ghulam Husain (paragraph 24 of Diary No. 13 and previous reports) introduced to Wagner’s servant Nasrullah one Najaf as a messenger to Tehran, but he refused to go further than Meshed. Nasrullah then proposed that he should be sent to Abdullah Khan, the Afghan Agent there, who would arrange for the letter to be taken on by one Abd-ur-Rahman. This, however, fell through as Najaf refused to go without the permission of the Naib-ul-Hukumah, which Wagner refused to obtain, desiring to keep the matter secret both from him and from Abdullah Khan. Eventually Nasrullah arranged himself with one Saiyid Husain, son of Saiyid Rahim, to take the letter to Tehran direct, travelling with the caravan of Bacha Naib Ghulam via Karez. (This man had not arrived when I left Karez but a careful watch is being kept for him there.) Enquiry is being made regarding the Abd-ur-Rahman above mentioned.\ktk 1 4Mw itatk ii-Iri 22. It seems tliat Sliaukat-ul-Mulk 's mission to Herat (see paragraph 22 of Diary No. 12) has been turned back from Anardarah by order of the Naib-ul- Hukumah of Herat who, pointing out that foreigners are not allowed to enter Afghanistan without the permission of the Amir, advises the party to put the object of their mission in writing. 23. Condition of the Country. —One Haidar Ardanji, a robber captured by Shuj a-ud-Dauleh, has been sent by the latter to Meshed from Kuchan by order of the Governor-General. 24. The Persian force despatched last week against the Zushki robbers has had a skirmish with them at Kang. It is reported that Jalal Nizam, the Persian commander, is entering into negotiations with the robber chief, Muhammad Zabih Ullah. 25. Shuja-ud-Daulah is taking (outwardly) active measures against Khuddu (paragraph 26 of Diary No. 11), and has engaged him and his gang in Kuchan territory. It is, however, reported that Khuddu escaped, and a telegram sent by Shuja to Tehran announcing his activity has been coldly received : the Minister of the Interior replying that the escape of Khuddu, if proved to be true, would shew that Shuja had not really intended to capture him. 26. Fear of famine is unfortunately general throughout the country, and rain is devoutly hoped for within the next ten days. Meshed ; ”1 W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, 14th April 1917.) His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan.CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 14 for the week ending the 7th April 1917. 1. Persian —Shahzadah Muhammad Hasham Mirza has notified his friends here by telegraph that he is about to leave Tehran to take up the appoint ment of Rais-i-Aukaf at Meshed. The Russian Consul-General is reported to have withdrawn his objection to this official on the score of his reputed democratic leanings. 2. The Muavin of the Minister of War has reached Meshed on pilgrimage. Captain Kuznetsov informs me that he expressed satisfaction with the nucleus of the Persian Cossack Brigade which he recently inspected. 3. The Russian Consul-General has advised Mujtaba Mirza, brother of Mustafa Mirza, to defer his departure for Turbat-i-Haidari until M. Antipov has had time to acquaint himself with local conditions. 4. The receipt of a letter from the daughter of Naiur-ad-Daula to her agent here, cancelling orders for the sale of her effects, has given rise to the surmise that the return of Naiur in an official capacity is probable. 5. British affairs. —Lieutenant-Colonel Grey, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General, left Meshed on the 5th instant for a tour of inspection to Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam and Kariz. • 6. Persian affairs. —Mushar-as-Saltanah called upon His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General on the 4th instant in connection with the matter reported in para graph 6 last week. He complained bitterly of Kamran Mirza’s general conduct of affairs and strongly urged that steps should be taken to get rid of him. % ' 1 Shahzadah Mustafa Mirza also called on the same day, and put forward the desirability of suggesting Mushar himself for the post of Governor-General. The question is being considered. 7. {Secret). — A cypher telegram from the Karguzar to the Minister for Foreign Afiairs states that Mushar-us-Saltanah is not exerting himself to compose the matters in dispute between the Shrine officials, as he has hopes of being himself appointed Mutawali Bashi. According to the Mutawali Bashi the action of the Shrine officials in taking sanctuary is due to his efforts to restrict their embezzlement of Shrine funds. 8. At the request of the Governor-General the Shrine officials have left the Telegraph Office, declaring, however, their intention to depute three of their number to spend the night in the Arg. Arrangements have been made that their grievances be composed by a committee of six, Haji Saiyid Assadulla and Najd-us-Saltanah representing the aggrieved officials, the Karguzar and Mushar-as-Saltanah the Mutawali Bashi, and the Postmaster General and Director General of Telegraphs the Governor- General. 9. {Secret). —With reference to paragraph 11 of last week the Karguzar has telegraphed in reply to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in cypher re losses occasioned to Persians by the Russian troops. He gives the names of persons deported from Tun, Gunabad, and Tabas to Russian territory and urges that application for their release and repatriation be made. He suggests that a Mamur be sent at the expense of the Persian Government to make detailed enquiries into the other matters mentioned. 10. With reference to the complaint of the Revenue Department detailed in paragraph 4 of last week, the Minister of the Interior has telegraphed to the Governor-General to summon Nusrat-ul-Mulk and recover the revenue from him. In case of refusal or delay in payment he should be detained. 11. The has informed the Peshkar of that department that revenue cannot be remitted to Hazara and Bakharzi sowars on their pay. He n K i , i i J , fj ' r-1 r 1 L0^ ^ L.CiA FOREIGN l i! ;ecr; JUN r AL DEV Letter. Dated Receiveu wo. M 3g 18 MAY I9J7 13 JUN 1917 vrauthorises, however, the retention of a limited number of the men on suggestion of the local Amin in consultation with the Governor-General. 12. He notifies the Peshkar that, obligation to assist in the collection of house-tax lying on the Governor-General, any deficiency in the amount received should be communicated to the Department for deduction from the Governor- General’s emoluments. 13. With regard to the request for the provision of rifles he telegraphs that none are available from Tehran. The necessary number should be purchased locally and charged to Government. 14. Both the Chief of Bujnurd and Shuja-ud-Daulah have sent telegrams to the Minister of the Interior professing their complete obedience to orders received and expressing surprise at his believing false reports calling their acts in question. Each lays the blame for disorder on the Kuchan frontier on the other and requests that no attention be paid to allegations from his adversary. The Chief accuses Shuja of assisting Khuddu, and Shuja protests that he is doing his best to lay Khuddu by the heels but requires time to accomplish this. 15. Twenty-five mounted and some forty infantry recruits have been obtained for the Persian Cossack Brigade at Kuchan. A Russian Officer Instructor informs me that the difficulty in obtaining recruits noted in paragraph 5 last week was due to intrigues in connection with Shuja-ud-Daulah. An affray in which members of. the Cossack Brigade here beat certain policemen and confiscated their rifles has been referred to the Governor-General for settlement. 16. A force under the command of Jalal-i-Nizam, consisting of $5 sarbaz, 100 soimrs and Persian Cossacks, and 22 artillerymen, with a mountain gun, has left Meshed to punish the Zushki and Shikari robbers. 17. British affairs. —The matter reported in paragraph 9 of Diary 10 has been settled to the satisfaction of the injured parties by the payment of tomans 300 to them : but the undesirability of allowing fhe present heads of the Barbari com munity to continue to hold that position has been impressed upon the Governor- General, and he has issued orders that these persons being worthless should no longer be considered to hold authority. 18. Russian affairs'. —With reference to paragraph 17, Diary 9, Mirza Ali, Muhammad Meshedi, Karim and Karimov, arrested for the preparation of seditious papers, have been deported to Russia under escort. 19. In notifying the abdication of the Tsar and the current state of affairs in Russia, the Russian Consul-General calls on Russian subjects at Meshed to assist in the attainment of victory over the enemy by obedience to the present government. 20. The Karguzar has notified the Russian Consul-General that the 5.000 kharwars of wheat already supplied represented the total that could be exported. M- Nikolski stated that he had received permission for a further 9.000 kharwars and requested the Karguzar to make enquiries regarding the amount available, and prices ruling in, the Jam district. 21. Considerable local indignation has been excited by the report that two Cossacks have outraged a young Persian girl in the vicinity of the city. 22. Persian and German intrigues. —At a meeting of .local democrats Baku Turki papers containing exaggerated accounts of the Russian revolution were read, the more fiery of the patriots expressing a desire to emulate these doings. A letter from Malik-us-Shura at Tehran was read counselling the amalgamtion of all democratic societies, announcing the adhesion of the Society of Union and Progress at Tehran to the democratic cause, and recommending similar action at Meshed. 23. News from Turbit-i-Haidari. —The mail waggon from Birjand to Meshed has been robbed near Gunabad, a sum of tomans 2.000 belonging to the Imperial Bank of Persia having been carried off. A man of the Hazara levies on his way to Meshedwas also robbed of tomans fifty in the same neighbourhood. In the latter case at any rate the Governor disclaims responsibility on the ground that the theft did not occur in his district. 24. News from Kariz. —Much unrest prevails at Kariz owing to orders for payment of revenue and discharge of sowars. Both Shuja-ul-Mulk and the Naib- ul-Hukumah of Kariz disclaim responsibility under present circumstances, and our Agent states that disorders are feared unless prompt measures are taken to remedy the state of affairs. The continued non-payment of arrears of pay overdue to the Hazara sowars appears to lie at the root of the difficulty. 25. News from Herat.—Abdus Sattar Khan, mehmandar of the German party at Bagh-i-Kartah, has been appointed by the Amir head of khowanin soicars and was invested with a khillat by the Naib-ul-Hukumah. After the daily transaction of office business he will continue to attend to the affairs of his German guests. 26. Kazim Beg and Barakatulla have visited Wagner and apparently something in the nature of a joint document was compiled by them. Kazim Beg has been attempting to spread rumours of disorders in Russia and of the speedy arrival of Turkish troops on the Afghan frontier. Bayerl is reported to have quarrelled with Wagner, and they no longer ride together. 27. Naib Abbas (No. 16 on list furnished by Ahmad Barbari, attached to Intelligence Summary No. 6) is reported to be in treaty with a Yazdi muleteer to take him to Persia. Muhammad Arab (No. 18 on same list) has sold his kit to pay his debts, asserting that Wagner has paid the servants nothing for three months. The servants have been making mischief with men of the guard by condoling with them on the hardship of being dismissed for old age. 28. Complaints are received as to the poor sale for merchandise at Herat and Maimana which has been received from Kandahar, as compared with the exorbitant rate of transport — fifty tomans per kharwar. 29. The Herat customs have been leased to Mirza Ghulam Haidar Khan for a period of four years, on his agreeing to pay two lakhs of krans above the receipts of last year. 30. All available ponies at Herat have been hired to bring in government grain from Badghist. 31. Seven pony-loads of copper coins have been received at the Herat Treasury from Kabul. 32. The Ndib-ul-Hukumah has directed that Shuja-ul-Mulk, Governor of Bakharz, be requested to arrest certain sowars who, on the report of the Governor of Gulran, had raided the flocks of certain recent immigrants to Afghanistan and killed one of the owners. 33. Condition of the country. — Owing to the maladministration of Kamran Mirza bread is being obtained with increasing difficulty and is of bad quality. Certain villagers have petitioned him to the effect that if his object in coming to Meshed was pilgrimage that end has now been attained and he might depart, but if government, he should show some care for the well-being of the people. 34. Shirwan continues disturbed ; the inhabitants of Kuran and Isfajir being reported to have taken sanctuary in the telegraph office at Shirwan against the tyranny of Shuja-ud-Daulah. On the other hand complaints have been sent to the Ministry of the Interior against the Shadullu sowars of the Chief of Bujnurd, who are reported to have driven the people away from their homes to the telegraph office, where they are forced to enter complaints against Shuja. 35. Khuddu has transferred his activities to the Juwain district and the rumour of his coming to Sabzawar has caused alarm in that vicinity. The action of the Governor of Nishapur in arresting a robber and wounding another has been approved by the Minister of the Interior, who, however, rejects his request for additional funds to cope with the law-breakers. E. A. F. REDL, Lieutenant-Colonel, for H. B. M.’s Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorassan. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. CS5F.D.—15-5-17—’29—JS.A.CONFIDENTIAL. ^V* ,K y $ &amp; ■ £ 'a 317 7 Meshed Diary No. 13 for the week ending the 31st March 1917. 1 1. Persian officials. —Najd-ud-Daulah, the newly appointed Governor of Khaf, has taken up his post. 2. Imad-ul-Mulk has been appointed Governor of Tabas and Tun. 3. Persian affairs. —The dispute mentioned in paragraph 8 last week is still unsettled notwithstanding various attempts to reconcile the parties by different persons, particularly Mushar-us-Saltanah, and the complainants against the Mutwalli Bashi are still in bast in the Telegraph office, which they have declined to leave until their grievances are redressed. At the same time they telegraphed to Tehran urging that the despatch of an inspector from Tehran to enquire into the Shrine affairs will serve no purpose as he will have no local knowledge. Probably they fear that he will be bribed by their powerful opponents to give a decision in his favour. 4. A complaint has been made to the Revenue department in Tehran by the local Peshkar-i-Maliyah that Nusrat-ul-Mulk (paragraph 16 last week) has not paid either the revenue due by his branch of the Taimuri tribe nor that payable on his private property. It is urged that the Governor-General be instructed to imprison him to enforce payment. Nusrat has also telegraphed to the Minister of the Interior representing that the money due has been used in payment of the sowars supplied by the tribe. 5. The enlistment of men in Kuchan for the Persian Cossack brigade has not been successful: no one having accepted the terms offered. Shuja-ud-Daulah has provided 25 of his own men. 6. Matters between Kamran Mirza and Mushar-us-Saltanah (paragraph 3 last week) are coming to a crisis. The latter has telegraphed to the Prime Minister saying that he can no longer work with Kamran, who is mismanaging his charge, and the Minister has informed the Governor-General that there are complaints against his administration. 7. Najd-us-Saltanah, the Peshkar-i-Maliyah, is anxious in regard to his position, and rumours are afloat pointing to a general change in the Revenue department. 8. British affairs. —Nearly 300 camel-loads of sugar have reached Meshad via Kirman and some anxiety is expressed in Russian trade circles; the Russian Tajir bashi has been instructed to submit to his consulate a list of merchants ordering goods from India with a statement of the orders made. 9. Russian Russian subjects who had arranged for the export of dried fruits, etc., before the prohibition of such/export was announced (paragraph 11 last week) have been instructed to submit statements of the amounts so prepared for the export of which permission will be obtained. 10. The export of a further supply of wheat to Russian Turkestan has been arranged (paragraph 13 of Diary No. 11). 11. Secret. —A circular cypher telegram has been received by the Karguzar directing him to supply certain information in connection with military opera tions and events relating to the war which have occurred in Persia. He is also to call for similar reports from his subordinate offices. The points upon which information is required are— (1) The date of arrival of Russian troops in the place in question; (2) The cause of such arrival; (3) Between whom fighting (if any) took place; If 'gE.IVEo 13 JUN 1917; 1 , 0 . 3 6 m 4 May 7977 JUN 19/7(4) What prisoners were made by the Russians : how they were disposed of and where they are now : with a list of property confiscated by the Russians; (5) The name of Governors and other Persian officials who helped the Russians in these matters, and where they are now to be found; (6) The names of Russian Commanders in each locality : and the period for which each place was occupied by Russian troops; and in regard to losses sustained by Persian subjects— (1) The details of such losses; (2) The cause of occurrence, or pretext on which the Russians took action; (3) A list of casualties sustained in each place by Persian subjects : (4) The names of all Persians deported. 12. Persian and German Intrigues. —Haji Muhammad Ja’far Kashmiri, the head of the local democrat society, has announced that the Turks have retaken Baghdad, defeating the British with heavy loss. 13. Much discussion on the subject of the Russian change of Government has taken place among the democrats during the week, and exaggerated and distorted accounts of what has occurred have been given, as might be expected. The general opinion expressed is that the change will be likely to benefit Persia and be favourable for her future independence. v 14. It has been stated at a meeting of democrats that Malik-ush-Shura and certain other extremists have received permission to return to Meshed. This is not likely to be true, but the matter will receive attention. 15. News from Shaukat-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Sistan and Kain, was well received when passing through Turbat. 16. A marked improvement in the conduct of M. Mikhailoff is reported since my visit, to which it is ascribed, probably with some truth. He returned a visit made to him by the Governor of Khaf in the house of our temporary agent, evidently to show the latter complimentary attention. 17. News from Karez. —Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor, has consented to pay his personal share of revenue due for the year, but like Nusrat-ul-Mulk (paragraph 4 above) declines to enforce full payment by his tribesmen owing to sowars’ wages being unpaid by Government. Shuja’s patience seems to be exhausted and he talks of resigning his post in despair. I hope to leave on the 3rd proximo for Jam and Karez and will be able to make representations to the Governor-General on return, after investigation on the spot. 18. News from Herat. —A robbery on an unusually large scale is reported from Badghist, a caravan of 18 persons having been plundered. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has sent out a force to punish the robbers. # 19. Wagner made an unsuccessful attempt to inspect a powder magazine outside the town on the 16th instant. The sentry refused to let him in. 20. With reference to paragraph 25 last week it is said that Wagner’s servants have found a messenger who is ready to go provided that he obtains permission from the Naib-ul-Hukumah. This the servants promised to secure for him. 21. The news of the occupation of Baghdad and Kermanshah reached Herat on the 17th and as was expected created some consternation among the German party. The information was first given to Wagner by his guard and he promptly requested that they might be changed as they were spreading false news. This was refused by the authorities. 22.

Press, Simla No. C.eiF.D.*—2*5-17—29—E.A.I-OIA FOHSIGN SKCK LeU ^* No. 34 M Bat ^ 27 APH '1917 ' Received 29 MAY 1917 j Meshed Diary No. 12, for the week ending the 24th March 1917. 1. Persian officials. —Shaukat-ud-Daulah (paragraph 7, last week) has been released on payment of 5,000 tumans to the Minister of the Interior and 2,000 to Kamran Mirza. He will shortly return to his home at Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. 2. A telegram expressing satisfaction at the return of Shuja-ud-Daulah to Kuchan bas been despatched to Tehran by the local Revenue office,. 3. The intrigues mentioned in paragraph 1 last week have not ceased. Mushar-us-Saltanah, the PeshJcar, is said also to be working for the recall of Kamran Mirza, and the latter’s rapacity seems to be on the increase. Alam-us-Saltanah, the other Peshkar, is also dissatisfied with the present regime and is arranging to take leave to Tehran. 4. Persian affairs. —The usual ceremonial visit was paid to the Governor General on the 21st instant, the occasion of Nauroz. 5. Reference to paragraph 3 of Diary No. 10. It appears that the Chief of Bujnurd by a present of money induced Kamran Mirza to transfer the government of Shirwan to him. Now the latter is confronted with the intrigues of Shuja-ud Daulah who is still trying to compel him to cancel the transfer. On the whole the present arrangement is probably the best. 6. The new Excise Commissioner has complained to Tehran of the sale of smuggled opium by foreign merchants in Meshed, and the Karguzar has received a telegram instructing him to look into the matter. 7. Intimation has been received by the Post Master General of Khorasan that the postal service with Hamdan and Kermanshah has been resumed. 8. The Shrine officials mentioned in paragraph 11 last week as having taken sanctuary in the Telegraph office as a protest against the mishandling by the Mutaalii Bashi of certain endowment property are still there, and their representations have not met with a sympathetic reception at Tehran. M. Nicolsky asked me to help him to secure the recall of this Mutawalli Bashi, who as previously reported has been responsible for intrigues against Kamran Mirza on more than one occasion, and the reinstatement of a former incumbent of the post who seems to have given more general satisfaction. I consented to support a Russian reference to Tehran ; but nothing has come of it; the Mutaivalli Bashi having received reassuring telegrams and the Russian Legation having apparently taken no action in regard to him although M. Nicolsky is said to have reported that his conduct has been opposed to Russian and British interests. This, if true, is hardly correct, but as the debts of the Shrine seem to have increased during the reign of this incumbent from thirty to eighty thousand tumans a change would seem to be advisable. The last telegrams from Tehran intimate that the complainants should be removed from the Telegraph office by force if they will not go quietly and announce that a special inspector will shortly be sent to Meshed to enquire into the dispute. 9. Russian affairs. —M. Vice-Consul Antipoff (paragraph 169ast week) arrived in Meshed on the 17th and is awaiting the arrival of his heavy baggage before proceeding to Turbat-i-Haidari. He called at this Consulate on the 20th and shews every desire to be friendly, offering to help us in any way possible. 10. General Kuropatkin has sent through M. Nicolsky a letter to the Chief of Bujnurd thanking him for assistance recently rendered in connection with the Turkoman revolt. 11. Some distress is reported among local Russian subjects and proteges on account of the prohibition of the export of dried fruits and vegetables to Russia : much having been stored and prepared for export by them prior to the prohibition .12. M. Popoff (paragraph 18, last week) has arrived in Meshed.. M. Mikhailof?’ report of the enquiry into the charges against him is awaited, and he is to remain here pending its arrival. 13. Persian and German Intrigues. —At the weekly meeting of democrats the recent allied successes at Baghdad and Kermanshah 'were discussed. It was said that the British would not be able to retain the former even if the report of its occupation by them was correct; and the opinion was expressed that the retire ment of the Turkish force from Hamdan was a strategical movement the reason for which would subsequently appear. The meeting agreed that there was no cause for anxiety as a retirement had once before taken place. 14. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. — Adal-ud-Daulah (paragraph 1 of Diarv ATn 10 ) had a good reception on arrival. ^ 15. Haji Shuja-us-Sultan, the late Governor of Turshiz, Turbat en route for Meshed on recall. passed through 16. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —The report of the appointment of Nusrat-ul-Mulk as Governor of Jam was correct, and Lemansky’s interpreter had come to Meshed to assist in arranging the matter. A strong message to the Governor-General caused the nomination to be- cancelled and ensured the continuance in office of Shaji-us-Saltanah. Nusrat called upon me subsequently to protest, and it was explained to him that I could not allow the expulsion from his post of a friend who had rendered valuable service to my Government, even for the advantage of another whose friendship was also appreciated, at least until the former had shewn unfitness for his position. 17. News from Karez.—T\us Ilbaigi Kaudani (paragraph 18, last week) has again appealed to our agent to have his affairs settled and has been told that the Consul-General is giving them his attention. M. Nicolsky agrees with me that nothing more need be done with regard to this chief than the acceptance of his expressions of regret and promises of good conduct for the future. I hope to see him when a visit to Karez and Jam can be arranged. ^ 18 ‘ agent has been informed b 7 Herat of the possible departure from thence of Wagner and Kazim Beg before long (see below), and he will suggest to the libaigi that assistance in the capture of these persons would help to shew his good intentions towards the allied Governments. !9. News from Herat.—We have received a communication from the Naib- ul-Hukumah apologising fo\ the delay in replying formally to our request to him to arrest the men concerned m the robbery from Taimuris on the frontier and stating that he has caught and imprisoned them. This is highly satisfactory. he Governor-General has been informed and has expressed his acknowledg ments. r &amp; Arrangements are being made by the IS aib-ul-Hukumah to muster and support the more helpless beggars of Herat city. 21. He is also arranging for the conveyance to and storage in Herat of metal tor the purpose of building a new Durbar Hall. 22. The Amir of Kain (Shaukat-ul-Mulk) is reported to have sent a deputa tion to Anardarah en route to Herat to salute the Naib-ul-Hukumah. The latter has ordered them to be treated with respect and escorted to Herat. 23. Wagner and his servants are engaged in preparations for departure. Accessary purchases are being made, and animals are being fed up ; and it is said that arrangements have been made with a Turkoman Sirdar to provide guides et cetera. Information has been sent by telegraph to Sistan, but it is thought likely t ui - t ie recent allied success in Western Persia may cause these plans to be changed. L / | 24. It seems that the report of the impending arrival of a large body of troops rom Sistan (mfe paragraph 23, last week) originated in the purchase of fowls and eggs lor the German party in some villages not previously exploited for the purpose.3 0f St|s N, i ftW* o i Lo ‘-i ^ a g n ^ r s servant Xasrullah is said to have searched for a messenger to take a despatch to Tehran but found no one willing to go even for a reward of 30 tumans m advance and a handsome present on return. Cavalry Jemadar who accompanied Kazim Beg from Kabul has been permitted by the Naib-vl-Huhwrnah to return to Kabul. - .V 27 ' Condition of the Oppression by Shikari and. Zushki robbers m e neighbourhood of Meshed still continues, and many villagers have recentlv come in to complain. The force mentioned in paragraph 27 last week has been detained pending the result of a reference to the local Government by the influential patrons of these robber bands, who have promised to bring in the cliieis w it bout bloodshed and to disperse the remainder. tv i 2 ?’ of Bujnurd has protested against the patronage by Shuja-ud- Gaulan, Governor of Kuchan, of robbers on the frontiers of their respective ter ritories, and Shuja has been ordered to arrest them. The Naib of the Chief in Shirwan has^ also reported to the latter that Shuja has secured the return .to the frontier of Khuddu (paragraph 25, last week) who is actually collecting men for further raids. Meshed ; The 24th March 1917. W. G. GREY, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. romttei juesttfllii i Mei illIT-*-/ APKJS17 may 1917 Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 14 for the week ending the 7th April 1917 . Personnel. April 2nd. —2nd-Lieutenant Hood, 28tli Light Cavalry, left Sistan for Saindak. April 4th—'K y. O’Donnell, I. E. T. D., left Sistan for Neh. April 7th .—Lieutenant Uloth, 28th Light Cavalry, arrived at Birjand. The Karguzar of Sistan. Motasim-us-Saltaneh, the late Karguzar of Sistan, left Birjand on the 6th instant for Tehran. He has given out that he has been appointed Consul for Persia at Astrakhan. Eakhr-ud-Dauleh, the Zurgwzar-designate, left Birjand on the 7th April to take up his appointment at Sistan. I understand that he is Motasim-us-Saltaneh’s uncle but a harmless old gentleman. The Governor of Sistan and Kainat. His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk entered Birjand on the afternoon of the 31st March. He was accompanied by Shahzada Muhammad Taki Mirza, new Rais-i- Amnieh, Mirza Abdullah Khan, new Rais-i-Nazmieh, Ashrafi Nizam, new Infantry “ Instructor,” Husain Kuli Khan, new Cavalry “ Instructor,” and Fakhr-ud- Dauleh, new Karguzar for Sistan. Captain Walker, commanding the British troops in Birjand, on my advice called on His Excellency on the 1st April. The visit t was returned on the 3rd April. The Kussian Vice-Consul on the 3rd April sent a message to the Deputy Governor enquiring whether the Governor was not going to call on him first. Misbah Diwan replied that in this Province the Russian and British Consuls always pay first calls upon the Governor, of which fact he might satisfy himself by enquiring at the British Vice-Consulate. M. Boulatoft then called. He received the return visit on the 4th April. Hisam-ud-Dauleh, I am informed, had proposed to go out a stage or to send an istikbal to meet Shaukat-ul-Mulk, but the latter excused him from doing either on account of his being in mourning for his mother. The Governor oh reaching Birjand paid Hisam-ud-Dauleh a condolence visit before proceeding to his own house. The Governor lunched with Hisam-ud-Dauleh on the 2nd April. The latter has informed the Vice-Consulate acting-dragoman that he intends to live on good terms with his uncle if possible, but that he doubts if some of the latter s followeis will allow such a state of affairs to continue for long. It is to be feared that Hisam’s own Mustaufi will also make mischief soon. German Emissaries. (1) Two spies have reported the arrival of three “ Turks ” at Chahar Burjak. These may possibly be the two “ Germans ” mentioned in last week s diary as having been at Khaju. It is said that Muhammad Azim Khan, Idozai of Regan, supplied their escort from Malhan to Chahar Burjak. 4.hey have changed from khaki into Afghan dress and have been provided with ten water-skins. Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan has given them a young Kudbedani camel sowa't named Siah Khan as guide to take them to Sardar Bahram Khan. Each of the Turks- has a horse, which presumably he will exchange for a camel. ^ One of our spies thinks that two of the men may be Indians on account of their dark skins.&gt;wuri-|r«iair l &lt;|'J*&lt;i I ■mlmilu - . ' UlTST S (2) Another news-writer says that three or four “ Germans ” have been map-making near Kadeh, and that another small party including an Arab and an Afghan have gone from Chahar Burjak to Rudbar. (3) A Baluch, recently arrived from Herat, says that the forty “ Germans ” there have been constructing Thanas along the road to Kabul. Nine of them fled to the Kainat frontier but' were captured and taken back to Herat. Afghanistan News. (1) The Headman of Kala Fath, Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan, was recently sent by the Governor of Chakhansur to Farah. On his way back he suffered a riding accident and is now at Kala Kang. (2) Yakub Khan, son of Mustafa Khan Sanjerani, who lives at Pusht-i-Kuh north of Amir Chah, has been summoned to Kandahar, and 100 sowars have been sent to Landi to arrest him if he does not go voluntarily. The Agricultural Prospects. The crops in the south-east of Sistan are withering for lack of water. The Afghans have div-erted the river water by means of a new canal, and negotiations are now proceeding between the Persian and Afghan authorities on the subject. Cattle and sheep are falling in price as well as in condition on both sides of the border on account of the scarcity of grazing. ^F. B.

Id-i-Naoroz. March 21st. —The usual ceremonial calls were paid in Sistan and Birjand. German Emissaries. 1. One of the four “ Germans ” reported in last week’s diary as having left Kala Kang for Kandahar is said to have returned to Kala Kang. He has been visiting ruins and shrines. 2 . I am informed that three “ Germans ” are still at Farah. 3. It is reported from Khwaja Ahmed that two Germans in the disguise of Malangs (beggars) were in Sistan for four days during the week. They are said to have'been lent horses and an Afghan guide by the Governor of Kila Fath. I noticed two beggars of strange appearance myself on the Id-i-Naoroz, but they certainly were not Germans! Possibly they belonged to the band of Saiyids mentioned in last week’s diary. 4 . It is being rumoured in Sistan that the Germans in Afghanistan have constructed an aeroplane in which they intend to leave the country ! I think it may be assumed that a German’s wish is father to this thought. Afghan robbers. See last week’s diary. The Consulate Dragoman has returned from a very successful interview with the Governor and Brigadier of Chakhansur, at each of whose residences he stayed a night. The Afghan authorities promised to use their utmost endeavours to recover the 16 camels stolen from Chah Muhammad Reza and taken to Bandar Kamal Khan. (Note. —Since the close of the week a message has been received from the Chakhansur authorities to the effect that 13 of the camels have been recovered.) Afghan affairs. The Governor of Chakhansur has informed the Consulate Dragoman that he has commissioned Kadkuda Mirak to proceed to Sarhad and persuade Haji Khan Gulab' Gurgich to return to his Afghan village. The Governor was informed that the Kadkhuda had apparently been indulging in a little raiding en passant. It was suggested to the Governor that in future he should give his emissaries going to Sarhad a letter of recommendation to this Consulate, as he sometimes does in the case of visitors to Sistan, after which they could pass through Koh Malik Siah comfortably. He said that he would do so. News from Birjand. 1 Xhe Russian Vice-Consul has been borrowing 500 Tomans from Misbah Diwan.

The latter seemed considerably embarrassed at his transaction with Misbah Diwan becoming known. 2 See Diary No. 5. The actual murderer of the Vice-Consulate news-agent Asadullah Beg has not been discovered, though the Kazi of Bujd and three other Buidis have been under arrest for several weeks. Eventually on the 16th March the Deputy Governor of Birjand paid over to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul the sum of Krans 1,770 (Government money stolen from the deceased) plus 5,650 Krans blood-money to be distributed between the father, widow, son, and daughter of the unfortunate man. 3 .

March 31st. —Lieutenant Hood, 28th Light Cavalry, arrived at Sistan from Bandan. {Omitted from last iveek’s diary.) —Motasim-us-Saltaneh left Sistan for Tehran on the 19th March. He handed over charge of his office to Mirza Ali Khan, formerly Naib Karguzar in Sistan, as a temporary arrangement. His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk entered his District at Khidri on the 27th March. The Birjand bazaar was illuminated the same night in honour of the occasion. 1. News reached Dehaneh Bagbi on the 23rd March that an Afghan caravan had arrived at Nakhela from the direction of Gurg. Captain Kreyer with -25 Cavalry and Lieutenant Davies with 30 Infantry went out in pursuit. The caravan was encountered at Kalmas on the 24th. Eighteen camels with about 400 rifles, I believe, were captured ; two camels were shot. The Afghans, about 12 in number, escaped in the darkness into the hills. They were tracked as far as Chah-i-Duzakh, on the 25th, where they apparently divided into two parties. On March 28th six of the Afghans were reported to be near Chah Hamza. This party safely escaped across the border. Note.—Since the close of the week I hear that four Afghans have appeared before the Governor of Chakhansur at Kala-i-Kang and complained of our troops’ action in seizing their loads. Their leader’s name is said to be Azim Khan Gulistani. They have stated that six of their party are still missing. They asked for permission to retaliate on our convoys but have been refused it. The Governor, Sardar Gul Muhlmm&amp;d Khan, is reported to have said that he would report the case to Kabul for orders. Governor of Chakhansur that they have come ahead of a large caravan guarded by 300 men, and they are invoking his assistance to save their caravan from being confiscated. 3. I hear that Haji Ali and 20 other Chakhansuris are preparing to leave for Mekran to fetch rifles. They hope to pass as innocent traders and to get Rahdaris from the Persian Director of Customs and myself through the good offices of Sardar Khudadad Khan. Personnel. The Karguzar of Sistan.

Reports have been received— 1 That three “ Germans ” reached Farah from the direction of Herat on about the 20th March. They were said to be going to Kandahar via Bakwa. 2 That two “ Germans ” from the direction of Kandahar with a guide were staying a short time ago with Sardar Taj Muhammad Khan at Khaiu. They tried to engage a guide to take them to Galugeh, Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai’s place of residence m Sarhad. 3 From the Russian Vice-Consul at Birjand, on 26th March, tliat three Germans in Persian disguise had passed through Khwaja Do Chain on about 21st March. This information seems palpably untrue as we have a levy post at the place named, and it is not apparent why M. Boulatoff’s informant did not communicate direct with our men.

Persian officials— -Vide paragraph 2 of last week’s diary. Adal-ud-Daulah has been appointed to the Governorship of Turbat-i-Haidari on payment of 2,000 limans down and a promise to pay 2,300 more after some months. It is expected that a reason will be found for Ins recall when M. Mikhailoff, the present Russian Consul, has been relieved. He leaves to-dav for Turbat. 2. Najd-ud-Daulah cousin of Ala-ud-Daulah,' who came from Tehran with Jrrmce ^ amian ^irza, lias been appointed Governor of Khaf. Z. Persian Shuja-ud-Daulah (paragraph 1 last week) is trying to ettect the retransfer of Shirwan to the Government of Kuchan. He has induced the Kuchams to telegraph to the Minister of the Interior begging for this course to be taken and pointing out the hereditary enmity which exists between the Zafranlu tnbe^ (that of Shuja-ud-Daulah and themselves) and the Shadullu (that of the Chief of Bujnurd). They threaten to attack the Shadullu forthwith if the Govern- ment will not accede to their request. These proceedings have caused a strong letter to be written to Shuja from the Governor-General directing him to drop the subject at once on pain of dismissal and the Shirwams have communicated to the Ministry of the Interior their desire to remain under the Chief of Bujnurd. 4. The Chief of Bujnurd has informed the Minister above mentioned of the distress existing among the Shirwanis on account of shortage of grain, and suggests that they may either be allowed to buy 700 kharwars of revenue grain which are actually m store at Shirwan or may borrow this amount on reliable securitv to be repaid on the realisation of this year’s harvest. 5. Good rain is reported to have fallen in Sarakhs district and harvest prospects are good. . . r • 6. The elders of the Barbari community have been asked by the Russian officers engaged in enlisting Persian Cossacks^to provide soivars from their people. In view of the intimate relations existing between them and ourselves the elders asked for my permission and were informed that the service would be good work for their young men and that by helping our Russian Allies they would be serving His Majesty’s Government. I have informed M. Nicolsky of this and he has expressed grateful acknowledgments. ‘ # 7. The Governor of Nardin (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 8) has also been asked to provide 100 sowars for the Persian Cossack brigade, but has not yet consented. 8. British affairs.—Vide paragraph 11 of Diary No. 7: Another instalment, amounting to nearly V 1,000 tumans, has been realised by the Imperial Bank towards the liquidation of Shuja-ud-Daulah’s debt. 9. Some trouble has recently been experienced from the Barbaris (paragraph f&gt; above). One of their young men several months ago forcibly abducted a girl of the Ismaili (Agha Khani) community and delayed to return her to her father when ordered to do so. She has now been returned, but the offender has not yet been produced and last week it was found necessary to imprison the secretary of the minor chief of the Barbaris pending the appearance of the youth. The secretary has been released on bail of 1,000 tumans, which is to be forfeited to Government in the event of the abductor not appearing for settlement of the case within ten days. 10. Russian affairs. —The Russian Consulate-General have been notified that the export of spirit and cotton cloths to Persia from Russia has been prohibited. 11. The export of 2,000 kharwars of grain to Russian territory from Sarakhs has been permitted (paragraph 13 of Diary No. 0). nE [ u C-’' IGN SECJ? - ho. 32 ^0 APR 1917 17 M t12.

Persian officials .—Intrigues against His Excellency Kamran Mirza appear to have recommenced ; several prominent Shrine officials and townsmen having telegraphed to Tehran requesting his dismissal and the re-appointment of Naiyir- ud-Daulah as Governor-General. • 2. The Chief of Bujnurd (paragraph 3, last week) has appointed his brother Shir-ullah Khan as Governor of Shirwan, and one Muhammad Riza Khan with 100 soivars to guard the roads of the district. 3. Adal-ud-Daulah (paragraph 1, last week) left for'Turbat on 16th instant. He paid a cordial visit of farewell to this Consulate, and it is hoped that his con duct of affairs in the Turbat district will shew an improvement during this term of office. 4. Shaukat-ul-Mulk, the newly appointed Governor of Sistan, left Meshed today for Turbat-i-Haidari, having delayed his departure pending my return from that place. In the course of our interview yesterday he promised to do all possible to assist in the importation of goods from India via Nushki and Sistan. 5. Persian affairs. —Active measures for the enlistment of men for the Persian Cossack Brigade are reported from Kuchan. 6. A body of local merchants have telegraphed to His Majesty the Shah urging that if permission is not granted for the export to Meshed from Russia of certain goods ordered by them before the prohibition of export was published they will have to go into liquidation. 7. Shaukat-ud-Daulah (paragraph 5 of Diary No. 5) has not yet been sent to Tehran, and representations are being made that as the case against him has worn itself out by protracted correspondence and negotiations he should now be released. 8. The local Revenue office has been ordered to recover and pay in the sheep tax for the coming year. 9. Shahzada Ibtihaj-us-Sultan (paragraph 5 of Diary No. 9) has reached Meshed and taken charge of the post of Chief Excise Officer. 10. Amin-i-Hamayun (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 9) has reached Meshed and presented to the Governor-General a portrait of His Majesty the Shah as a special mark of royal favour. This gift was received with rpuch pomp and ceremony. 11. The sons of the late Naib-ut-Taulia and certain other Shrine officials have taken sanctuary in the telegraph office against the 'Mutwalli BasJii in con nection with the handling by him of certain endowments. All guards and durbans have sided with the Mutwalli Bashi and trouble seems to be likely. The matter will receive attention. , 12. British affairs. —His Majesty’s Consul-General quitted Meshed for Turbat- i-Haidari on the 11th instant, arriving there on the 12th. On the 15th he left, arriving at Meshed on the 16th. 13. Russian affairs. —The export of 3,000 more kharwars of wheat to Russian Turkestan this time from Kuchan, has been sanctioned. The amount required is gradually being made up. 14. Persian and German Intrigues. —A secret meeting of democrats has taken 4 place during the week as usual. The first question discussed was that of the new newspaper “ Bahar ” which is to be published in Meshed and for the initial expenses of which Tumans 550 have already been realised. It is to be managed by a brother of the Malik-ush-Shu’ra (paragraph 9 of Diary No. 49 of last year). Mention was then made of the proposed poor-house and the advisability of securing lor it democratic management was again urged ; some abuse being delivered against the Karguzar in this connection. A suggestion was made to establish a “ school of art ” at Meshed. I2 15. The family of Muaiyid-ul-Wazara, the late Karguzar of Tun, who was deported to Russia last year Jbave appealed to Tehran begging for him to be allowed to return to Meshed and answer the charges against him. 16. Isews from Turbat-i-Haidari. —I found the position here very unsatis factory. M. Mihhailcft’s general attitude towards us and British interests has evidently been uniformly hostile during his tenure of the Turbat Russian Consulate : it seems to have been sufficient for a British subject or protected person to have a case or a grievance for him to receive instant and complete opposition from the representative of our Ally whether any Russian 'protege w r as concerned or no. I discussed with M. Mikhailoff at some length his conduct in the case of the two prisoners reported in this office Diaries 39 et seq of September last, and obtained from him an admission that in the present circumstances at least it had not been correct; and I also succeeded in inducing him to put right some minor matters. His successor, M. Vice-Consul Antipoff, is expected to arrive in Meshed to-day. 17. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —A report has been received that Nasrat- ul-Mulk has been appointed Governor of Jam in place of Shaji-us-Saltanah dis missed. This is moreover said to be an intrigue on the part of M. Lemansky which appears to be highly probable. The matter will receive attention. 18. News from Karez. —M. Popoff has not yet left, and our agent reports that he is still trying to borrow more money from the Governor, Shuja-ul-Mulk, who is said to have paid some of his debts during the week, although the two seem to have had a dispute over the question of receipts for sums advanced ; Shuja demand ing them and Popoff declining to give them. I discussed with M. Mikhailoff the case of extortion reported in my Diary No. 2, paragraph 10, et seq. He maintained that Popoff was guilty but that Lemansky was not as he had only received his share of the spoil to keep him quiet. We also talked over the llbaigi Kaundani s affair, and w T ere agreed that no active measures should at present be taken against him. I hope to visit Karez and Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam after Nauroz. ' • 19. Is ews from Herat. —A census of Herat town and surroundings is being taken. 6 8 20. Kazim Beg annoyed the Naib Solar on the 2nd instant by visiting him without having made a previous appointment. 21. On 3rd instant the I\aib Solar was heard to remark that his object in seeing V agner and Kazim Beg so frequently was to get from them some instruction m military works. 22. A jemadar roundly abused a shopkeeper on the 4th instant for allowing Haji Ahmad, one of Kazim Beg’s servants, to sit in his shop and engage him in conversation ; threatening to report him if such a thing occurred again. 23. Some alarm was spread in the town on the 6th instant by a rumour that a large force of foreign troops (whether British or Turko-German was uncertain) were coming up from Sistan. ^ letter was brought to Wagner on the 6th and the man who brought it was told to come to the Bagh-i-Kertah later in the day. He did not return and has not since been seen. V agner is having his horse and camel-saddles mended. -n °f ^e Country. —It is reported from Kuchan that Shuja-ud- Daulah, the newly appointed Governor, is sheltering the robber Khuddu and has recei\nd a telegram from the Minister of the Interior threatening him with condign punishment m case this is true. It is generally known to be the fact that Khuddu’s recent depredations have been committed under Shuja’s auspices with the object of bringing about his reinstatemet as Governor. 26. A post carriage carrying opium has been attacked and plundered near Bajgiran. 27. ^ Zushki robbers from the neighbouring hills have recently been active and a fore e is being sent out from Meshed in the Dizabad direction to deal With them.

J 34 ' The news of the Turkish defeat at Kut-al-Amarah, and ot the Russian success in N. W. Persia has somewhat embarassed the local manutac hirers of lying rumours, and a ' change of Turkish plans,” which is at present the only variant which they have been able to evolve, is not entirely sa is ac ory as an explanation. An element of novelty has, however, been 1D J°* j l s ^ a ^ emeil t that the Baluch tribes in the Sarhad have risen, ana inflicted heavy losses on the British forces in that region. 125. Consular changes. —M. Antipoff has reached Ashkabad on his way to relieve M. Mikhailov at Turbat-i-Haidari. * Persian Cossack Brigade.—The arrival of Colonel Mamonov is still delayed. In the meantime local recruitment has commenced. A proposal to ? 0Ver s ?™ ar8 the Chief of Nardin en bloc is reported, and it is stated a lecruits will also be sought from the Hazaras (Barbaris). Recruiters have been sent to Quchan. Herat and Afghanistan. Q^rtnans and -Reports from Herat indicate a shortage of cash with both Wagner and Kazim Beg. Their servants are industriously spreading rumours of Turkish successes which appear to find little local cre- uence. ^ All their followers manifest discontent, and are anxious to leave Afghanistan. 128.

Firing was carried out and according to Afghan notions, considerable proficiency was displayed by the personnel. 9 maxims were on parade. ^ Orders have been issued for the tails of artillery horses to be docked banged. The Naib Salar stated in Durbar that he had received information from Kabul that shell fuses are now being manufactured there very efficienctly and that they had met with the approval of the Austrians. 130. Discowtett*.—Consequent on the chastisement of one of their number with a rifle butt by an instructor, the Taimani recruits left the parade ground, and some of them proceeded direct to lodge a complaint with the Naib Salar in person. The latter treated the matter as one of insubordination and ordered the spokesmen to be chained and imprisoned. He pardoned the remainder on their expressing contrition. 131. Drill .—Orders have been issued for instruction in drill by whistle and signal. 132. Medical .—The Military hospital is now reported to be well equipped with medicines and steps are to be taken to treat civilian patients on payment. Russian Turkistan. 133. Sarakhs.—kn. influential and rich Turkoman named Janakbai has been arrested by the Russian authorities, 8 Werndl rifles and 5 maunds of Persian powder having been found in his house. The Pristav is stated to be nervous with regard to Afghanistan as rumours of fighting in Sistan had reach ed him. Turkomans have been threatened with penalties by the Russian authorities for concealing grain. 134.

British affairs.—Amii Khan, who has twice been deported from Meshed on account of the murder of our dispensary dresser Murad Khan a few years ay o’ is said agam to have come to the town. Enquiry is being made. further misconduct on the part of Mirza Hasan Khan, late British Ayent at Karez, has come to light in the course of M. Mikhailoffs enquiry (paragraph 9 last week). It seems that by his orders our sowar sentry at Saugan wrote letters incriminating a local trader of intriguing with Barkat-ullah and Kazim Beg and extorted Tumans 5 from him, threatening to shew them to the Russian Consul in case the trader refused to buv them for that sum. One of the letters was written I with a preparation of onion juice which renders the writing invisible. This discovery removes the last shadow of doubt in the matter reported in paragraph 29 of Diary No. 1. The letters referring to the German party which were ■ i Isumjosed to have teen found upon the chemist were forged by Mirza Hasan to obtain revenge upon Haji Mahmud Herati. This case will now be reported separately in detail. 14 Russian affairs— The Russian Legatioii has ordered the return to the Hardin sowars of the rifles confiscate* from them (vide paragraph 3 last week). 15 The Karquzar has been informed officially by the Russian Consulate General that the export of paper, excluding books and printed matter to Persia, has been prohibited. 16 M Nicolsky has induced the Karguzar to telegraph to the Chief of Bujnurd reouestina him to provide 3,000 kharwars of wheat for export to Askabad The Chief has replied that there is none to spare for export from his territory, and as M Nicolsky is not inclined to accept this reply, the current rates at wdnch grain is sold in Bujnurd have been called foi. 17 In consequence of secret information furnished to the Chief of Police, that officer,'accompanied by M. Caal of the Russian Consulate some police, and Russian Cossacks, raided the- house of Mirza All Muhammad, a Russian secret agent on the afternoon jof 23rd February. They found the agent, with several other persons, actually engaged in printing off copies of an objectionable circular headed “ Long live the Turkish Government.” They subsequently searched the houses of som! others of the guilty party and collected a number of papers which were intended for general distribution with a view to increase the number of German and Turkish sympathisers in Meshed. The men arrested have made statements incriminating certain influential persons in the town. Enquiry is proceeding. 18. Persian and German Intrigues.-Ihe Karguzar has heen asked by the Prime Minister to arrange for the return to Meshed of Abdullah Mirza Saham- - Ayalah, late Commissary of Police in the town, and Saiyid Khalil, Rukn-ul- Jam, democrats, who were deported to Tehran a year or so ago He has replied, after consulting the Russian Consul-General, at whose request they were removed, that their return cannot be allowed at present. 19. Referring to Diary No. 53 of last year, paragraph 13, it is disappointing to find that the democratic leader Shaikh Jawad, Balm Farush, is in Moscow, notwithstanding M. Nicolsky’s expressed determination that te should no obtain the necessary passport. A brother of his has recently obtain from the Karguzar to the Persian Ambassador at Petrograd asking for his help behalf of Jawad who intends to visit Petrograd ostensibly in connection with Ins trade. 20. In connection with Diary No. 6, paragraph 14, M. Nicolsky declines to believe that Biza Khan, the Governor of Darajez, is helping the democrats m the efforts to import arms and ammunition, and thinks that our information instance is given by an enemy of Riza Khan. Unfortunately that is no pro a , but we are not able at present to furnish proof of the accusation against him. 21. At a meeting of democrats held on the night of the 26th instant the events reported in paragraph 17 above were discussed and general disapprova o i u Ali Muhammad’s conduct, presumably in allowing himself to be found ou , expressed. No other special subject was discussed on this occasion. 22. A German, who had come recently to Meshed from Resht dressed as a native of that town, was arrested and imprisoned in the Nazmiah. He desc himself as a traveller. 23. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Notwithstanding that the export of gram from Turbat is prohibited, the Deputy Governor is permitting the export, receiv g a tuman for each load. 24. An earthquake took place on the evening of 20th ultimo. Some conster nation ensued but no casualties are reported. 25. The murder of an Afghan Jew at Karez is reported. Fmes to ^ a mouiit of Tumans 2,000 are to be levied from the surrounding villages mclu g VS)26. News from Karez. —At the personal suggestion of M. Mikhailoff, Shuja- ul-Mulk (paragraph 10, last week) has written to the Ilbaigi counselling him to come in to Karez with Mir Baki Sultan and interview the Consul; but the letter, to judge from our agent’s version of its contents, seems to have been unfortunately worded, and has apparently merely had the effect of increasing their fear to come in. M. Mikhailoff is still at Karez; his departure is uncertain. 27. News from Herat—The Amir’s birthday was celebrated on the 18th ultimo with the^usual rejoicing and congratulatory visits. 28. The arrival of four vaccinators from Kabul is reported on the 19th ultimo. All children of the better class are being vaccinated. 29. It is rumoured from Bala Murghab that two Russian Cossacks came to a frontier post and informed the guard of their desire to become Mussalmans; and that the Governor has referred the matter to the Naib-ul-Hukumah for orders. 30. Wagner is said to have told Bayerl recently that all preparations for a journey should be made ; and on the 20th ultimo it was observed that the mules of the German party were taken out to exercise saddled, which is a new departure. 31. Russian news is supplied regularly to Kazim Beg by a servant of his who obtains it from the Turkomans living in Chahar Bagh. 32. It is reported from Kabul that of the Austrians who are supposed to have become Mussalmans two have been appointed to the Public Works Department, four are working in the manufactories and four are employed as drill instructors with the troops. 33. Wagner, Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat-ullah were among those who paid congratulatory visits to the Naib-ul-Hukumah and the Naib Solar on the Amir’s birthday. • 34. The Naib Solar has directed the Meh?nandar of Bagh-i-Kertah not to allow the officers of the Afghan guard to accept gifts of food from Wagner, Meshed • ^ W. G.

INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY NUMBER 7 FOR THE WEEK ENDING THE 17th W) ”5^} Khorasan and North=East Persia. 79. Russian Force —General Sukovkin, who commands the Turkistan Lossack Division during the absence on the Hamadan front of General Fidarov has arrived together with his staff officer Lieutenant-Colonel Sychev, and is carrying out the inspection of the 1st Semirechia Cossacks. He will subse quently pioceed in tne direction of, if not so far as, Turbat-i-Haidari. The position of the troops here is somewhat anomalous; they are subordi nate to the Caucasus Army Headquarters as a fighting force but for interior economy depend on Turkistan. ^9. Persian CossacJc Brigade. —The cadre for the Khorasan division of this force has been increased by the arrival of various Persian officers and non commissioned officers from Tehran. A second officer instructor—Captain Kuznetsov cf the 1st Khoper Cossacks—has arrived, and Colonel Mamonov was expected a few days ago. It is reported, however, that he has secured an exchange and will be replaced by another officer. No move towards recruiting has yet been made, the officers present limiting themselves to the collection of data as to favourable sources of recruitment. 81. —Although our agents report that M. Mikhailov terminated the enquiry into the conduct of the Russian agents at Kariz and Turbat-i- Sheikh Jam on the 12th instant no report of any sort has yet been rendered by him to the military authorities. Lieutenant Popov in any case leaves the post shortly and has already been replaced by Captain Obukhov also of the Taman Cossack Regiment. i Herat and Afghanistan. 82. Germans and adherents. —The identity of the new “ German ” has / not yet transpired ; he is receiving instruction in Persia^and in riding. / K The Afghan officer in charge of the guard at Bagh-i-Karta, being a new hand and having allowed Wagner and his satellites to go out unaccompanied, has been confidentially admonished by the Naib-ul-Hukumat that they are in no case to be allowed out without an escort. Four pilgrims recently arrived here from Mazar-i-Sharif which they had left at the beginning of the current month. They were interrogated separately by a reliable person and all stated that at the time of D their departure the Afghan guard was maintained at the door of the house occupied by Mohendro Partap and that his Indian servants were then present. They had not seen Mohendro himself but inferred from the above that he had not left. A letter from Maimana dated the 4th January notes the presence of three Indians at Mazar, but this intelligence is not recent enough to have much value. 83. Instruction. —The Naib Salar has ordered the selection of six men per battalion for instruction in range-finding or judging distance. After some weeks of aiming drill the Kandahari battalion has been per mitted to carry out the range practice of 5 rounds per man. The Kaib Salar inspected the Khaki battalion in field exercises on the skirts of the Maulvi hills and expressed himself much pleased with their per formance. For this occasion the pouches accompanying the German rifles were issued to the men, and this is taken as an indication that the rifles themselves will shortly be issued.» 2 O, Dismissal —The Naib Salar stated ia Durbar that m his report to Kabul concerning Sultan Muhammad Khan, deported Colonel of the Logari ion he bad attributed bis dismissal to defective eyesight, and had recommended him for pension, Colonel Abdul Ghias Khan, commanding the Kotwali battalion, has been transferred to command the Logari battalion, and a cavalry officer, Colonel Ahmad Jan, to the Kotwati Battalion in his place. A rumour obtains that the Naib Salar has received instructions to dismiss o'.inion the commanding officers of the Ghaznichi and 9th Herati battalions, Colonel Muhammad Amir Khan of the Cavalry, and Kumaidan Said Muham mad Khan of the Khaki Battalion. 85 Medical .—First aid instruction is being imparted to selected soldiers. A load of medicines has reached Herat from Kandahar and more are expected. 86. Kandahar .— According to an arrival at Herat from Kandahar, battalions at the latter place are below strength and difficulty is being experienced in completing the deficiencies. 87 Maimana. —A report from Maimana dated the 4th January states that in the autumn of last year the following were received from Kabul 150 camel-loads ammunition. (Description not specified.) 30 guns. (Said to be breech-loading.) 600 German magazine rifles. On the 21st December 1916, 112 camel-loads of ammunition were received. This Mas the balance of a convoy of 300 cameis which left Kabul, and of which the major part had been delivered at Mazar-i-Sharif. The Maimana garrison was placed at 3 battalions infantry. 2 squadrons of cavalry. 15 guns (said to be breech-loaders). German magazine rifles had been issued to 1 battalion the Charyari of the above. The Kandahari battalion at Mazar-i* Sharif is also reported to have been armed with these rifles. Tw t o officers vdth a small escort have been sent to Kabul from Maimana to bring uniforms for the troops. 88. Afghan with Turkish forces —Arrivals from Hamad an stated to a reliable person that one Sardar Abdul Majid Khan, whom they identify with the absconding Governor of Shiburghan, had been commanding a detachment of JMujahhadin under Turkish orders on the Hamadan front. The facts regard ing him not being known, the general impression produced by his presence and employment was that he had been sent by the Amir to assist the Turks, and the Amir’s co-operation vith the latter Mas therefore considered probable ; should the Turkish army succeed in approaching Afghanistan. As these persons had already left when the report reached me it was impossible to procure further details. Russian Turkistan. 89. Frontier affairs .—A report from Pul-i-Khatun notes that on the 3rd instant Afghan robbers carried off 700 sheep from Sher Tapa, a village^ wfihm Russian territory some 15 miles north of Pul-i-Khatun (probably the incident mentioned in paragraph 73). 40 mounted men pursued the robbers who, being reinforced, were able to capture 6 of the rescue-party and owners sheep and to make off with their booty. Subsequent negotiations with the Afghan Sadbashi at Zuifiqar resulted in a promise from the latter to restoie both prisoners and property. 90.

Prisoners of TFar.-The possibility of the implication of prisoners of war in the disorders m Turkistau of last summer having been seriously considered it was recently stated in the Duma that investigations had shewn that they had no connection with the matter, and in conseauence no necessity to evacuate the prisoners from Turkistan exists. It is further stated that their employment on cotton plantations is under consideration. 93.

Russian force .—General Sukovkin with his staff officer left for j Askhabad on the 23rd instant.. The outrage at the Maliyat in which men of the 1st Semirechia Regiment were implicated has turned attention to the relaxa tion of discipline consequent on the prolonged dispersal of the men in small isolated posts, and the advisability of substituting for these, squadrons, (or lesser units), under their officers at certain main points was mooted. I pointed out that the present system had proved fairly successful in intercepting Germans and their adherents in entering or leaving Afghanistan, and also in preventing, j as far as our knowledge goes, communication between the German party and the Turkish forces, and deprecated any change likely to facilitate such com munication. They replied that the matter was being discussed in an academical spirit, particularly as it depended on the Staff of the Caucasus Army. I have, however, requested the G. S. O. at Caucasus Army Headquarters to keep a watch on the matter. 97. Reported suspect —An agent recently sent in a mounted messenger with a letter stating that the day before his arrival at Zulfiqar a European in native dress had entered Persia at that point. His further movements had not been traced, but the Russian cordon and the Transcaspian authorities were warned. There is no news from Herat of the movement of any of the German party. 98. Search.—The Secretary to the Russian Consulate*General in conjunc tion with the local police here have searched the houses of several native inhabitants, including that of a former Russian agent. 99. SaraJchs .—The revenue office and treasury at Persian Sarakhs have been looted by robbers. 100. Germans and adherents. —Wagner’s native followers have again dis played over bearing conduct towards inhabitants of Herat. The British Agent has been warned to look out for himself as the Germa n party wish him no good. This is by no means the first of such warnings he has received. No definite news of Mohendro Partap is to hand, but the British Agent gives a report which reached him at second hand that Partap had escaped to Russian territory by the connivance of Indians domiciled there. According to information of some time back Partap had been in communication while at Mazarwith Hindu merchants from Bokhara. 101. The “ Royal and Imperial East Indian Detachment, Kabul. A. document bearing the foregoing high-sounding heading has been forwarded by the British Agent at Herat and constitutes a nominal roll of the Austrians at Kabul, giving their corps, native country and next of kin. Of the 88 names it contains, four are officers and the remainder non-commissioned officers and t men, 13 are noted as temporary Afghan citizens which status presumably implies adherence to the Muhammadan religion. Two are noted as having fled from Afghanistan (these were captured by the Russians at Kariz), one as having accompanied von Hentig to China, and one as having died. The docu ment is undated, but the date of the death is given as the 24th Becember 1916 so that the list was presumably compiled during the current year and on this KHORASAN AND N. E. PERSIA.

Of the total number, 57 are Hungarians; hut N. Austria, Styria, Croatia, % Buhovina Moravia, Bohemia, Galicia, Bosnia, and even Bavaria are represented, although all appear to belong to the Austrian service. The majority are infantry, but there are men of every arm (except the air service) down to the Przemysl Labour Corps. According to information with the Russian Staff here about 150 prisoners have escaped in ail from Turkistan to Afghanistan and lersia. 102. Herat troops .—New khaki uniform has been issued to the khahi battalion who were inspected by the ‘Naib Salar : the latter has ordered the issue of new uniform to the Gbaznichi battalion, Rifles have been issued to the Taimani Sapper recruits who will now undergo musketry training. A rumour that the Naib Salar is proceeding on leave after Naurnz is causing rejoicing among the garrison who look forward to a less strenuous time. 103. Medical.—‘1% loads of medicines have been received for the Military hospital. RUSSIAN TURKISTAN. 104 Disorders.—Of 74 persons tried in connection with the summer dis« orders in the Sanzar division of the Jizak district 41 were sentenced to death bv the Military Court, and the remainder acquitted. Of the 151 accused belonging: to the Zamin division of the above district 48 were condemned to death, 49 to penal servitude, sentences varying from life to 12 years, and the remainder acquitted. The confirmation or otherwise of the sentences by Hnnorjil Tvnrnnflthin is awaited. The Russian staff officer from Samarkand, recently here, estimated the deaths of officials and Russian inhabitants in the above disorders at 150. About 4,000 Russians in all lost their lives (on the same authority) m Semirec la. 105. Appointment. —Lieutenant-General Korulski has been appointed Military Governor of Syr Darya in succession to General Madritov. lOfl. Agriculture.—Oewml Kuropatkin has assigned a sum of one million rubles for the destruction of locusts in Turkistan during e curren year. It is proposed to employ troops as well as prisoners of war on t 0 oper lions which extend over 1,00000 desyatin. 107. Projected railways .—The Minister of Ways of Communications ha? introduced a bill in the Duma for the assignment of 774,000 rubles for investigations during 1917, in connection with the Alexandrov uai*. i projected line. 108. Baku labour troubles.—In consequence of strikes of workmen employed on the old-fields and other undertakings at Ba u. Military Govern Dr of the district has notified his intention, in the even future trouble, of sending all musulman Russian subjects involved to wor rear of the armies. Persian subjects causing trouble in this connection wi deported to their own country. 109.

There is no indication that any of the men mentioned are serving elsewhere than at Kabul. Probably, however, No. 69 Pranz can be identified with the cook of the Herat party, and No. 33 von Gruden with the surveyor of the same party, known to the Afghans as Grodan or Grudan.

Russian Force .—It appears to be practically decided that the 5 Cossacks under arrest in connection with the outrage at the Maliyat will be sent to Askhabad for trial as soon as the investigations by the Russian Con sulate-(Ten eral are completed. EWr Austrian prisoners who have been re captured m the last few weeks will be sent at the same time. 111. Suspects. Reference paragraph 97, a further report states that the suspected persons were two m number, one of whom maintained silence and was thus by implication unacquainted with Persian. They were traced to a June ion of roads ia the direct.on of Meshed, but nothing farther has been heard ot them. A few nights ago an agent brought in a man in native dress resembling an unintelligent Russian, who bad been found lurking in a garden near the town. I placed him as a Russian deserter and despatched him to the Russian mi itary authorities who state that he is a deserting Tartar soldier from the “ sbornaya komanda ” (employed on orderly and kindred duties) at Askhabad. V . isit 1 afcioure P° rtedil1 P ar agraph 98 is stated by the Chief of Police to have yielded proof of a plot among Russian Musulman sub jects at Meshed to rise against the Russians. Indications of a possible move- ment of this nature have previously reached us and were reported at the time to the Russians. I he Russian Consul-General recently stated that the farther investigation of the affair has been entrusted to his Secretary. HERAT AND AFGHANISTAN. 113. Oermms and adherents.—'Wagner's approaching departure is again rumoured and the fact that his mules are being sent out for exercise saddled up is taken as confirmation of the report. iS °- 3 G a 13 APR 19] j 7 MAY I.917 ’ the through bis servants, Kazim Beg is in touch with Turkomans at Herat and is said to obtain news of doings in Russian Turkistan in tins manner.' The Russian Military Agent has just received a report from Mazar-i-Sharif which states that Mohendro Partap is in constant intercourse with the Afghan Governor of that city. The letter, however, is undated and although 5 the recipient places it at about 3 weeks ago, it has quite possibly been delayed in transit. Owing to a fair at Mazar no arrivals from that place have been noted here lately. 114. Artillery.—kS, recent maxim practice on the outskirts of Herat Wagner happened to be present and criticised the firing as inaccurate and the gun as likely to become unserviceable very shortly. (This is the third in stance of his giving advice on military matters which has reached us.) On investigation the Colonel of the Artillery reported that it was the Herat made ammunition used which was at fault, but that he had a sufficiency of English-made ammunition. The Naib Salar ordered that the latter only was to he used in future with the maxims. Of the consignment received on the 7th January from Kabul 300 boxes are said to contain Kabul-made ammunition, and the remainder—at a rough computation 700 to 800 boxes—English am munition. 115. Cavalry .—Instructions have been issued for 50 selected sowars to be trained in the lance exercise. When proficient they will be employed as in structors for the remainder of the cavalry to whom lances will be issued. 116. Infantry.—-ThQ men of the Logari battalion are reported to be much rnnoyed by taunts from other men at their taking no action to prevent their Colonel from being deported to Kabul. The Colonel of the Kandahari battalion S33gsb(1)• has requested his men to sbave off their beards, alleging as his reason the approach of the time of “ ghaza.” 'Even with this reason given, the older men considered the request an undue interference with their personal concerns. The uniform cloth brought from Kabul has only proved su^cient for 2 fy battalions and 2 batteries. , RUSSIAN TURKISTAN. 1' 7 Turkomans .— Orders have been issued that the Turkomans who dis. parsed after the engagement at Ak Kala to the Karakala and Chikishliya pristayates of the Krasnovodsk district are to bo rounded up and disarmed, and also tha' one half of their cattle is to be confiscated. 118 /Idmini 8 tf &gt; ciifio i,l i-“ m ~‘Eef.oYG inaugurating Medical reforms in the methods of government of the native population, General Kuropatkin has invited an expression of views of persons of experience in the columns of the semi-official “ Turkistan News.” 119. Supplies .—Considerable difficulty is being experienced both at Tastr kentandat Askhabad in obtaining articles of primary necessity such as flour, meat e l c. Arrangements have been made to bring in over 1,000 rail-waggon loads of flour from Siberia. Rye from Russia is being imported, and rice is being requisitioned at various points in Turkistan. The Turkistan administration has undertaken to provide some 850 tons of dried oats and 3 times that quantity of preserved tomatoes for the needs of the army and an official has been deputed to organise the necessary cultivation in the neighbourhood of Tashkent and Samarkand. 120. War loan. Owing to improved methods of publication the present war loan is being taken up by the native population on a far wider scale than was the last. Bokhara has contributed 3,400,000 rubles as against 600,000 on the last occasion, the Amir himself having taken up one million. Khiva has contributed upwards of a million. Native reports display an original point of view, stating that the Russian Government is now so poor that it is reduced to borrowing from its native subjects. 121. Projected railway construction.—The construction of a line connect ing the Central Asian Railway stations of Syr Darya and Jizak, mooted before the war is announced as likely to materialise in the near future. 102 versts in length it would (with the addition of short feeder lines) not only serve the Famine Steppe, but would also provide a more direct route between the stations named.

March 10th. —Major Hawley, 28th Light Cavalry, left Birjand for Sistan. German Emissaries. No details have yet reached me of the recently arrived “ Germans ” in Afghan Sistan. Spies in Afghanistan have reported that two Germans from Herat with their servants were near Anardarra on the 3rd March and that they were returning to Sabzawar. It seems possible that these men really continued their journey to Chakhansur. Afghan Robbers. See last week’s diary. I have not yet heard of the restoration of camels having been made between the Headman of Bandar Kamal Khan and the Levy Outpost Commander of Nawar Chah. The Governor and Brigadier of Chakhansur have however written to me an assurance that Abdul Aziz of Deki Dela will be prevented from raiding across the borders. News from Afghanistan. Rumours are being spread with extraordinary persistence in Afghan Sistan to the effect that Mir Jehird and Bahram Khan have attacked and defeated our troops at Khwash. Two relatives of Jehind are said to have recently returned from Turkey with bombs. The Sardars of the Helmand are being asked to contribute to the support of the Sarhaddis. Ata Muhammad Khan of Chahar Burjak and Taj Muhammad Khan of Rudbar have been discussing the matter together. In Khwaja Ahmed (Sardar Khudadad Khan’s village) the same rumours have been distributed. It is probable that Jehind is at the bottom of this mischief, and that he is actuated by the wish to conceal the real facts of his discomfiture from the Baluchis of Afghanistan and Sistan. On the other hand, in response to a letter from me informing them of the rout4 of the Turkish troops at Kut-el-Amara and of the submission of Jehind in Sarhad, the Afghan Governor and Brigadier of Chakhansur have written me the most cordial letter I have received from that quarter since the outbreak of the war. They “ thank me for the good news and hope that such victories will continue.” The Provincial Finance Director. Basir-us-Saltaneh reached Sistan from Birjand on the 6th March. He says that he will spend the summer in Birjand where the Revenue administration requires more careful attention. A school for Sistan. See Diary No. 1 of 1917. The scheme for establishing a school on modern lines is meeting with a good deal of opposition from the Mullas, and it is doubtful if it will fructify. Basir-us-Saltaneh also expresses doubts as to the need. He has asked me whether it is a good thing to multiply the number of men like Motasim-us-Saltaneh who is in fact his relative and the son of an old friend! F. B.

(I) Various spies have reported : (1) that two “ Germans ” from Persia reached Deh Dost Muhammad near Bandar Kamal Khan on about the 3rd March. These proceeded to Chahar Burjak on the 9th March; (2) that two “ Germans ” reached Farah from Herat on about the 10th March; (3) that four “ Germans ” came to Kala Kang from the direction of Farah early in March; (4) that four “ Germans ” came to Kala Kang from Chahar Burjak on about the 11th March; (5) that two “ Germans ” left Kala Kang for Farah and three or four “ Germans ” left Kala Kang for Kandahar via the Khash Bud bn about the 12th March ; (6) that two “ Germans ” are still at Kala Kang. (II) A newswriter at Rud-i-Mahi reports having heard from a camel sowar of Bazman that a “ German ” really escaped from Afghan Sistan last December guided by Wali Muhammad Mamarzai ^ Sherozai). See Diary No. 51 for the week ending 16th December 1916 : it is possible that one of the two Mekranis therein mentioned was a German or Turk in disguise. The man is said to have been provided with guides and assisted to reach Bazman by a brother of Sardar Juma Khan, Ismailzai. • Afghan Robbers. News has just been received of a raid committed by Kudbedanis (probably) on the Trade Route one stage south of Lutak, in which 16 unloaded camels are said to have been carried off at night while grazing. I have decided to send the acting Consulate Dragoman, Khan Sahib Saiyid Allah Banda, to Kala Kang to urge the Afghan authorities to take suitable action. News from Afghanistan. (1) A band of about 40 men, calling themselves Saiyids but speaking a strange language, have come to Afghan Sistan from. Herat. They practise medicine and live in 12 tents. They have expressed a wish to enter Persian Sistan. Thev are said to appear interested in the affairs of Mir Jehind. The Governor of Sistan and Kain. Shaukat-ul-Mulk is leeving Meshed for Birjand to-day (17th March).Meshed Diary No. 8 for the week ending the 24th February 1917. '*v 1. Persian officials.—Vide paragraph 1 of last week. Shuja-ud-DauIah left for Kuchan on the 18th. Adal ud-Daulah has arrived in Meshed and visited me on the 23rd. He is now an applicant for the Governorship of Turbat-i-Haidari, the fate of which is still undecided. 2. Persian affairs. —The Mutwalli Bashi has telegraphed to various Ministers and others in Tehran complaining in regard to the case reported in paragraph 5 last week and pointing out the discontent which, according to him, still exists among the Shrine officials. He invites the Ministers to consult Naiyir-ud-Daulah in the matter, a significant suggestion. 3. Russian affairs. —Paragraph 10 of last week’s diary. It seems that the Russian Cossacks visited Nsrdin for the purpose of collecting arms and ammunition apparently under the misapprehension that the local people were directly or indirectly connected with the recent rebellion of Yamut Turkomans. Mansur- ul-Mumalik, the Governor of Nardin who is at present in Meshed, induced M. Nicolsky to telegraph to Tehran requesting that the arms confiscated from his sowars should be returned to them. This is necessary as a means defence against Goklan Turkomans with whom the inhabitants of Nardin have perpetual trouble. 4. Paragraph 12 of Diary No. 6. The refugee in question arrived at Meshed on the 22nd, and was interviewed in the Karguzari. He teems to be a German and either an escaped prisoner or a spy. His story is that some months ago he came, accompanied by a companion, to Turkestan in search of gold : that the companion stole his money and papers, including passport, and made off : and that he found his way to Darajez hoping to reach Tehran. The Prime Minister has wired to the Karguzar directing him to send the man to the American Legation at Tehran, probably at their desire, but M. Nicolsky prefers to keep him here pending receipt of instructions from the Russian Minister, as, in the event of orders being issued for his return to Tashkend, much time would be lost by sending him first to Tehran. M. Nicolsky has asked me to telegraph my views to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, which I have done. As we have received nothing ourselves from the American Legation and are convinced that the man’s story is false this course would seem to be suitable. 5. On the evening of the 15th another German refugee was found in Meshed and handed over to the Russian Consulate-General. 6. Persian and German Intrigues.—Vide paragraph 13 of Diary No. 5. A cir cular has been issued to all democrats in the province asking them to subscribe to the Meshed poor-house fund. The democrats have taken up this to show their philanthropic tendencies, and they have secured the support of the Karguzar, by whom I have also been asked to subscribe. 7. Mention w r as made in a recent meeting of democrats of great victories I supposed to have been gained recently by the Turks in Western Persia, and confidence was expressed that by Nauroz (21st March) Tehran and other places of importance would be in their hands. 8. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —A fight between two parties of Baluchis residing in this district and tyrannical conduct on the part of some local sarbazes in the villages around Turbat are reported. It is hoped that a Governor, preferably the former, viz., Shahzada Mustafa Mirza, will shortly be appointed. 9. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —M. Mikhailoff (paragraph 17 las week) left for Karez on the 17th instant on the completion of his enquiry. Neither the Ilbaigi Kaudani nor Mir Baki Sultan have come in to see him owing to the threat ening messages to which reference was made last week. They were visited by our Karez agent, who gave them our letter of assurance, but they have replied to me both through him and through Muhammad Aslam Khan, British agent at Herat, that they do not trust the Russians and will only make submission to ourselves.The matter may have to stand over for the present, but the two chiefs are now said to be entrenching themselves in considerable force at a favourable spot some few miles on the Persian side of the frontier where they are prepared to resist any interference. Fortunately M. Mikhailoff is about to be transferred. M. Nicolsky informed me yesterday that his successor at Turbat-i-Haidari would be a Vice-Consul and that he would be under Meshed. He added that he had himself been opposed to the arrest of the Ilbaig; Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan last year. M. Popoff is being relieved at Karez, and it is hoped that M. Lemansky will be dismissed as a result of the enquiry which has just terminated. In this latter connection M. Mikhailoff has written acknowledging receipt of the vernacular papers I had sent him and asking for a copy of Mirza Hasan Khan’s statement. This is being despatched to him at Turbat-i-Haidari. He gives no intimation of his views as to the conduct of MM. Popoff and Lemansky. 10. News from Karez.— Shu] a-ul-Mulk has been appealed to by the Ilbaigi Kaudani and Mir Baki Sultan for help in their difficulty but has replied that he cannot move. 11. It is reported that M. Popoff appealed to Shuja-ul-Mulk for a loan of money and that the latter promised him 1,000 tumans as soon as he can sell his wheat. Our agent hears that M. Popoff has already received from Shuja money and articles to the value of about 2,800 tumans. 12. Shuja-ul-Mulk’s revenue officer has been asked by the head of the depart ment in Tehran why the Governor has not recovered revenue grain for the last three years, and has replied that the money has been used for payment of his sowars. 13. News from Herat. —The annual fair and races known as “ Jubbah ” took ‘ place on the 9th instant. They were attended by the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who gave a place in his tent to our agent. The Germans, with Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat-ullah, were in another. 14. The Naib Salar sent to the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 10th a person dressed as a Darvish whom he regarded as suspicious. As the man refused to answer questions he has been put in chains, thus to remain until he speaks. 15. On the 10th a conflict took place between Naib Abbas, a servant of the German party, and some camelmen owing to the camels having blocked the road along which Abbas was leading his mules. The Captain of the guard at Bagh-i- Kartah has reported the incident to the Naib Salar. 16. It is reported that the Austrian Surveyor known as “Miazu ” comes daily to Barkat-ullah for instruction in the Kuran. 17. A sowar who has just returned from Chakhansur says that he spent three months there during which time he saw no Germans except Bayerl, and adds that there are at present no Germans or Austrians on that frontier. 18. Haji Ghulam Husain (paragraph 26 of Diary No. 6) has forbidden the servants of the German party to come to his shop, and has requested the Mehmandar of Bagh-i-Kartah to send his own men and not the employes of his guests. 19. Our agent, while at the fair mentioned above, was warned by a friendly Khan to be careful of Wagner and K^zim Beg as they were determined to do him some mischief. The agent asked for details but the Khan could not give any further information, 20. Mir Aftab (paragraph 32 of Diary No. 51 last year) has got into trouble in Afghanistan. He arrived in Herat from Kafir Kilah under a guard, and the Naib- ul-Hukumah has ordered him to be sent to Kandahar en route for India after certain claims have been recovered for him. 21. Our agent has purchased, presumably from a servant of the Germans at Herat, a document which appears to be a nominal roll of the German and Austrian force in Persia. It is being forwarded in original to the Government of India. 22. A private report says that His Majesty the Amir was still in Jalalabad on the 8th instant.3 ICTlte tfiflissiB ,ULUU 23. Condition of the Country.— li 8 of last week’s diary. The Minister of the Interior has replied to the Chief of Bujnurd that the prisoners should be tried and dealt with according to their crimes. 24. The capture of Mehrab, another leader of Khuddu’s gang, is reported from Shirwan. 25. Several thefts have been reported in Meshed town during the week but all have been or are being dealt with in a satisfactory manner; in only one case is the thief still at large. To-day the Rais-i-Nazmiah, in accordance with a promise made when I undertook to use good offices with M. Nicolsky and the new Governor- General to ensure his continuance in office, has presented a copy of his budget and requests that the Consuls-General will consult as to its suitability with a view to induce the Government to provide funds to meet the whole. At present they offer only about half. This will be done. Meshed : The 24th February 1917 .} W. G.

Tho Eussian military authorities inform me that the Cossacks under arrest have confessed to their participation in the murder. Prom their statement it appears that an officer of Maliyat Gendarmerie, Taggi Khan was the accomplice, and probably the moving spirit, in the outrage, and that j 0m mE nl • ^ 0 . ssac ^ s on occasion as a guide to the promises to be robbed. The information was at once communicated to the Secretary of the Russian Consulate-General charged with the enquiry, but he unfortunately waited till the following day before arresting Taggi Khan, who had in the meantnme disappeared. Colonel Gustchinis anxious that the men found guilty should be executed here in order that the Persians may have ocular evidence that justice has been done, but orders from superior authority are awaited on the subject. 65 German emissary.—Ahmadi Barbari now states that in addition to the description of the person to whom he was to deliver the despatch the name also was given him, but that he has forgotten it. It resembles, he state, Zameh ” or.“ Zumeh ”. Some additional doubt as to the likelihood of his having been entrusted with a genuine despatch is thrown by a communication from the British Agent at Herat, according to whom Ahmed was dismissed both from German and Turkish service some time before his departure from Herat. The contents of the message (received telegraphically from India) comprising information as to members of the party which in most cases we know to he correct at the time the message was written, do not hear the nature of a document intended to mislead. The Russians consider that the statement f that the Amir is making no warlike preparations is not borne out by the facts. It is in any case possible that Wagner utilised the man as a last resort or even that the actual messenger passed it on to him ; the latter hypo thesis would perhaps account for the totally insufficient sum given. Purther attempts to elicit the facts are being made. A statement of the personnel of the German and Turkish parties given by Ahmed from memory is appended, and the information has been given to the Russians for circulation to all posts. 66. Germans and adherents .—The arrival at Herat of an escaped prisoner from Russian territory is reported. Wagner claimed him as a fellow country-man and secured his transfer to the Bagh-i-Karta. According to I this man’s statement the prisoners in Russian Turkistan are very slackly J guarded and many more would make there escape if they were assured of a ; good reception in Afghanistan, This is probably correct as from all accounts I have received many prisoners at Tashkent and other Turkistan towns are j allowed a large measure of liberty, orchestras are formed from them, etc., and the Russians probably trust to the comparatively comfortable conditions in which they live to discourage an adventure which may turn out badly. Khorasan and North=East Persia. Herat and Afghanistan.The Herat agent has so far received no confirmation of Mohendra Partap’s departure, but the Russian Military Agent has heard from a spy in whom he places no great confidence that Mohendra crossed the Russian frontier some where in the neighbourhood of Maimana. Kazim Beg has raised the drooping spirits of his followers by the statement that he hopes to be on the move about Nau Ruz. 67. The Naib Salar addressed his officers in Durbar on the necessity of thorough training of the troops and outlined a programme of field exercises and hill w'ork for the spring, the men carrying 5 Herati Mans of ra tions and kit, He Tvould not appear to be a very close student of contempor ary history as he added that the consequences of insufficient training could be noted in an army like the Russian which was beaten whenever it took the field. 68. Discontent. —As a pendant to the above comes a report that a party of sepoys, both artillerymen and infantrymen, have taken sanctuary at the Shrine of Gazargah near Herat, and formulated their grievances to the Keeper of the Shrine for transmission to the Naib Salar. These include (a) inability to exist on the Government pay and allowances, (&amp;) impossibility of following a civil supplementary avocation to eke out the above owing to the number of parades and the strictness with which they are now bound to attend to their military duties, {c) the prohibition to any soldier to claim his discharge unless he provide a substitute. 69. Recruiting. —In reply to a complaint of hard work entailed by short- handedness in certain batteries, the colonel commanding the artillery stated that arrangements had been made to complete all artilley cadres in the spring. 70. Artillery. —Artillery horses in Herat having been declared sufficiently trained, orders have been given to despatch them to Oba and Shaflan, and to obtain other horses from the stables there for training. 71. Expert Advice. —'Wagner recently visited the intrenching ground at Robat-i-Ghoriad and set the Austrians with him to dig a model trench lor the instruction of the Afghan sappers. 72. Deportation. —Colonel Sultan Muhammad Khan, commanding the Legari Battalion, has been deprived of his command by the Naib Salar and despatched under escort to Kabul. The proximate cause was the failure of the Colonel to recover a sum of money stolen by a sepoy from an officer in the regiment, but it is probable that his reputed share in intrigues which resulted in the removal of General Muhammad Rahim Khan was the real reason. Russian Turkistan. *1%. Frontier Affairs. —Turkomans at Dahna-i-Zulfiqar are reported to have assisted Afghan robbers in carrying off 500 sheep from Russian territory, and the Sadbashi of Zulfiqar to be implicated in the affair. The garrison of Russian Sarakhs is reported at 200 men of the 14th Turkistan Rifles with 1 maxim and 70 men of the Frontier Guard. Turkomans continue to attempt to leave the country and troops from Merv are said to have brought back 200 out of 300 who were crossing into Afghanistan. 74. Railway construction. —Rumours prevail at Sarakhs that the contract for the branch line from Tejen to Sarakhs has been taken up and that it is to be constructed within 6 months ; also that an extension to Pul-i-Khatun is pro jected. 75. Governor-General. —General Kuropatkin has visited Kaghan, Kerki and Termez. He was to return to Tashkent in time for a conference of provin cial governors, including the governor of Transcaspia, at Tashkent on the 2nd February. 76. Disorders. —The trial on the capital charge of “ attempting to wrest the Jizak district from the Russain Empire ” of 151 natives concerned in the summer Jizak disorders was fixed to begin on the 3rd instant before a Military Court.77. Exhibition train. —An entire train fitted up with war trophies has | been formed at Krasnovodsk and will circulate during the next 3 months throughout Turkistan and as far as Orenburg. A detailed time-table of halts at various stations has been published : these range from 1 to 10 days (Tashkent) according to the importance of the place visited. An adequate staff for giving the necessary explanations is attached and arrangements for native interpreters m districts visited will be made. The idea seems worthy of imitation. 78. Goods traffic. —New arrangements are being made for interchange of goods-waggons between the Central Asian and Orenburg lines at the indepen dent goods station at Tashkent. Meshed ; ^ E. A. E.

Meshed ; 8th February 1917.V Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 9, for the week ending the 3rd February 1917. Personnel. February 27th. —Captain Blackwell, 106th Hazaras, and Captain Pengelly, Supply and Transport Corps, left Sistan for Saindak. German Emissaries. (1) A spy has reported that two “ Germans ” came^to Deh Mirak in Afghan Sistan early in February from Kandahar having travelled along the British Border from Chaman. They are said to have returned towards Kandahar travelling up the Khash Rud. It seems that these men must be the same individuals mentioned in my Diary No. 7. From another source I have heard that a brother of Khalifa Khair Muhammad recently arrived in Deh Mirak. It seems more probable, there fore, that the “ Germans ” have come in from Bampur as originally reported. (2) Two or three other “ Germans ” are said to have come from the direction of Herat and to be in two parties at Kala Kang and Chahar Burjak. Their guards seem to think that they intend to leave Afghanistan via Amalaf. Afghan Gun Runners. There seems to be some truth in the report (see Diary No. 7) that a gun running caravan has recently entered Afghanistan, though the numbers first stated are probably exaggerated. . I have been informed that five camel loads of arms and ammunition were consigned to Saiyid Abdul Hamid (see Diary No. 18 of 1916). The Saiyid himself has recently come over to Khwaja Ahmed from Deh Mirak. He denies being the consignee of any guns, but my information on the point, I believe r is reliable. I have telegraphed to Quetta and Kerman about the Saiyid, who admits having served the Germans last year at Kermau and Bam for some months. Afghan Robbers. (1) On the 1st instant I heard that one Abdul Aziz Kudbedani, who has been superintending the clearance of the canal at Deki Dela, had collected 20 or 30 outlaws for the purpose of raiding British caravans in the Chagai district or Persia. One reporter said that he was being instigated thereto by Sher Jan Sanjerani (? an ez-Thanedar of the Chagai Levies, who is suspected of being in close touch with the Germans). On the 3rd March it was reported from Girdi that Abdul Aziz’s gang had lifted three camels of the Sistan Levy Corps while grazing near the Nawar Chah Post. The Jemadar pursued the raiders and managed to lift seven camels belonging to the Helmand Baluchis on the border. The headman of Bandar Kamal Khan, Sardar Wali Muhammad Khan, has since been directly corresponding with our Jemadar, and the camels have probably all been restored to their respec tive owners. I have addressed the Chakhansur authorities at Kala Kang requesting them to suppress the raiding proclivities of the Kudbedanis. (2) Another minor case of border raiding has been reported from Kila Nau (one of Sardar Khudadad Khan’s villages), in which two Sistanis were killed and their donkeys carried off. The donkeys were subsequently recovered by some of the Sardar’s men who pursued the robbers across the border. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieutenant-Colonel, H. B.

Persian officials.-—1 visited the Governor-General on Wednesday, 31st January. He informed me that Sirdar Makhsus {vide paragraph 10, last week) had been appointed to be Governor of Turshiz and had been directed to proceed thither. His Excellency added that the Turbat appointment was still under consideration. 2. Adal-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan, has threatened to resign his post if orders are not issued forthwith for the restoration to his control of certain of the villages recently transferred to Bujnurd. This demonstration is ignored by the local authorities who would accept his resignation willingly and are only awaiting the payment of sufficient peshkush by Shuja-ud-Daulah to recall Adal {vide paragraph 2, last week). 3. Persian affairs. —Reference to paragraph 6, last week. The Governor- General has requested me to write to the Naib-ul-Hukumah in Herat on the subject of the raid committed by Muhammad Umar Khan upon the Taimuris. This has been done accordingly, and the Naib has been asked to recover the plundered property and to punish the offenders. 4. The Postmaster-General of Khorassan has not yet found any person who can offer the security required for the Meshed-Tehran and Meshed-Gunabad carriage contracts for the coming year, and has telegraphed to the Minister of Posts, Tehran, to that effect. 5. Vide paragraph 7 of Diary No. 52. Shauhat-ud-Daulah is still in Meshed, the Governor-General having contrived to evade compliance with urgent and repeated orders from Tehran to despatch him thither. His Excellency complained to me on the subject, and said that he had written strongly asking that he might be released and allowed to return to his post as Governor of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. 6. A fresh cause for discontent against Adal-ud-Daulah is reported from Kuchan in connection with the levy of tax on wood, a perquisite of the local Governors. He appears severely to have punished certain Kadkhudas who refused to pay. Evidently he feels the necessity of making what he can with all despatch. 7. With reference to paragraph 5 above, the Karguzar has telegraphed to the Foreign Office urging the release of Shaukat-ud-DauIah on the security of Haji Husain, Agha, the owner of large landed property on the Afghan border in the neighbourhood of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. He points out that 300 well-armed sowars are required to maintain order in that locality, and that Haji Husain undertakes to provide the men required at his own charges in addition to the security for payment of money to the heirs of the deceased Nusrat-ul-Mulk. 8. Russian affairs. —Referring to the last sentence of last week’s diary, it | seems that on the night of the 26th January at 1-15 a.m. 15 Russian Cossacks forcibly entered the Maliyah treasury and stabbed to death five persons, three of whom were Gendarmes, one a non-commissioned officer, and one a prisoner who happened to be awaiting disposal. The Gendarmes were armed with rifles, but appear to have been taken by surprise as they suffered as stated before retaliating. One Cossack was shot and the remainder then decamped, having failed in their object, which appears to have been to plunder what money the treasury contained. The matter is still under enquiry at the hands of the Russian Consulate-General, and several Cossacks have been arrested, upon the clothes of some of whom blood stains were found. It is supposed that they must have had a Persian or other local confederate as guide, but no such person has as yet been discovered. Much feeling prevails in the town, but the matter has been promptly taken up and no disturbance is anticipated. The question of blood-money for the murdered men has been raised, and it is said that the Russian Legation has declined to consider this aspect of the case. A demand will however be made by the Persian Government. EN o n u o a i t ii ITOIA FC L ; Le i Icn. ■ 0 . band 16 i, f-e u v. i v au 16 t 229. M. de Beauvais left for Russia on Sunday, 28th ultimo. 10. The second of the two escaped Austrians mentioned in paragraph 12 last week gave himself up in Meshed on the 30th and was sent to the Russian Consulate- General. 11. Vide paragraph 13 of Diary No. 2. The export of 10,000 kharwars of grain to Russian Turkestan has been sanctioned by the Persian Government. 12. The Chief of Bujnurd is co-operating satisfactorily with the Russians in regard to their operations against the Yamut Turkomans. He has sent an agent to accompany the Cossacks to Gumbad-i-Kabus for general assistance. 13. Persian and German intrigues.—Vide paragraph 15 of last week. It is said that 700 roubles have already been collected for the purchase of firearms : we hope to procure a list of the subscribers. Democratic energy appears to be directed at present chiefly towards the establishment of a local asylum for the poor. The interest of some prominent officials has been aroused in this movement, against which there is nothirg to be said. Muazzid-ul-Wazarah, the Chief Passport Officer, has recently attended some democratic meetings, chiefly in connection with this new scheme. 14. Paragraph 16 last week. Meshedi Kazim visited me without hesitation. He denied most of the statements made by our informant making out that he had come from Tabriz via Tehran, but there is no doubt of his having been a sowar in Turkish employ. He will be carefully watched. It is said that the Turks at Hamadan are now enlisting Persians forcibly. 15. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —It is believed here that Mustafa Mirza will be reappointed to the Governorship. 16. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. —Negotiations in regard to the Ilbaigi Kaudani, of which mention w T as made in paragraph 19 last week, have received a check as he has been arrested by the Afghan authorities and taken back to Herat. The cause is not yet known. 17. Vide paragraph 20 last week. M. Mikhailoff is believed to have arrived at Jam. Shaji-us-Saltanah has returned also from Meshed. 18. News from Karez. —On 24th J anuary the British agent arrested one Ahmad, a former servant of Wagner, who first stated that he was an Isfahan! but on arrival in Meshed admitted that he was Ahmad Barbari (paragraph 20 of Diary No. 3). He was found to be the bearer of a cypher document fromWagner intended for a German at the American Legation in Tehran. This has been sent to the Government of India, and Ahmad is beirg detained here for the present. He states that he accepted the mission in order to benefit himself by giving up the paper to us and appears to have given information regarding it to our sowars at Karez voluntarily. 19. News from Herat. —The Naib-ul-Hukumah is taking special measures for the collection of straw in Herat and has fixed the Government rate at Krans 20 per Kharwar. He will also provide Government transport, when necessary, for importation into the town. The Revenue authorities are issuing advances to help in the purchase. 20. It is reported from Kabul that an extra Shahi is being taken on every Kabuli rupee paid in cash as revenue. This is said to be on account of recent military expenditure. 21. Orders have been issued finally that no Turkoman emigrants are to be allowed to remain on the frontier. * 22. W agner has had an attack of ffever dunrg the week. 23. An arrival from Maimana reports that Mahendra Pertab has recently crossed the frontier between Andkhui and Maimana. This is regarded as doubtful, and confirmation is awaited. A special note from our Herat agent in regard v to Mahendra is expected to arrive next week.G. M. Press, Simla*—No. C797F.D.—20-3-17—29—M.B.G.

Blackwell, 106th Hazaras, made over charge of tne Hazara Levies at Neh to Lieutenant Matthews. Thom as, Army Veterinary Corps, Major McEnery, Transport Corps, 2nd-Lieutenant Beard, 25th Mountain Battery, and 2nd-Lieutenant Dewar, 19th Punjabis, left Sistan for Saindak. German Emissaries. (1) Saiyid Mustafa (see Diary No. 6) is being sent in Military custody to Quetta. He left Sistan on the 24th instant. s Py ^s reported that a “ German ” left Herat on 28th January and travelled through Sabzawar and Anardarra. Opposite Duroh he decided to abandon the attempt to cross the border and retraced his steps. He had one servant and two horses, a white and a grey. He called himself Mustafa. As Saiyid Mustafa, our prisoner, crossed into Sistan with two horses, a white and a red-roan, it seems possible that this is the individual referred to. In this case the spy’s reports are rather belated. On the other hand a report from Durukh’sh, dated about the 19th instant, describes a German ” ,at Anardarra who is carrying a Mauser rifle, a revolver, a pair of binoculars and a rosary, and dressed like a Persian trader. The Governing Family of Kainat and Sistan. See last week’s Diary. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has not left Tehran yet. I am informed that he is leaving in a day or two. Afghan Gun-Runners. The identity of the gun-running carvan has not been satisfactorily settled, though one spy declares that the name of its leader is Sahibzada Ghulam Ali. I have also learnt that one of two rice-caravans which recently returned to Afghan istan travelled through Mian Kangi and did not go near Lutak. Afghan robberies. Sheep and cattle raids have been committed by border Afghans in three Persian districts recently, viz., Mian Kangi, Kharika (on the northern beach of the Hamun) and Duroh. In Mian Kangi some donkeys have also been lifted across the border. F. B.

The Karguzar is raising subscriptions to build a dome over the ooet Firdausi s tomb in Tus. . Tumans 3,000 ^monthly are required for local police expenditure for the coming year, but only 2,500 have been allotted by the Peshkar-i-Maliyah. The Governor-General has referred the question to Tehran. • TIie Meslied Mali y ah office has issued a circular to all subordinate offices in Khorassan directing them to furnish a statement of the revenue grain outstanding at the end of the year. 9. British affairs. Another thousand tumans has been recovered fromShuja- ud-Daulah (paragraph 2 above) for payment to the Imperial Bank. 10. Russian Reference to paragraph 8, last week. One Taki Khan, an official of th# Gendarmerie, who absconded from Meshed after the attack by Cossacks on the Maliyah Treasury, has been recalled by telegraph. It seems that some of the men arrested for the crime have admitted that he was their guide on the occasion. 11. Secret. —The Governor-General recently mentioned to M. Nicolsky that the Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari was not well disposed towards him (Nicolsky) and that he feared that the Consul might make some report to Russia against him. M. Nicolsky replied that he need not be afraid of that. 12. An European has been arrested at Darajez who professes to be an American, but the Russian agent there states that he is a German. He is being sent to this Consulate, which is in charge of American interests. 13. Vide paragraph 11, last week. It seems that only 5,000 kharwars of wheat are to be exported, the Persian Government still maintaining that shortage exists. 14. Persian and German Intrigues.—Vide paragraph 13, last week. The amount collected by the democrats for the purchase of arms and ammunition has now risen to 1,365 roubles which have been deposited with one Haji Muhammad Jafar Kashmiri, to whom has been entrusted the importation of the arms. Some anxiety exists regarding the probability of the arms being confiscated on the EuGLOG. I INDIA FGGGIGN i S Letter. do. 24 1,1 ( Dated 23 MAR 1917 . Received IB APR 191 7 8 1 ifrontier, but it is said that two months ago five Mauser pistols and two magazine rifles reached Meshed in safety, having been secreted in cotton tissue. These are reported to have come in via Sarakhs, but it is believed that Biza Khan, the Governor of Darajez, is prepared to assist in this matter, having himself democratic ^ tendencies. The question of this man’s dismissal will be taken up at once. f 15. News from Turbat-i-Jam.—M. Mikhailoff arrived here on February 2nd and has commenced the enquiry referred to in paragraph 20 of Diary No. 4. It is also hoped that he will interview the Ilbaigi Kaudani, who has been instructed to wait upon him and offer promises and guarantees for good behaviour in future. The reason for the llbaigi’s return to Afghanistan, mentioned last week, having been merely to bring his family and dependents, he has re-entered Persian territory and is now at Kamanah Bisht near the border. Our news-writer remarks with unconscious humour that he is “ ready to pay what is required ” for the purpose of becoming reconciled to the Russians and British. M. Mikhailoff was still at Jam on the 5th instant. 16. News from Kariz. —M. Popoff has recently visited Jam. It is beheved that in order to have a better position at the enquiry mentioned above he has repaid to certain persons there money which he had received as gratification. 17. News from Herat. —The British agent writes pointing out that Ahmad Barbari, whose capture at Karez was noted last week, had been dismissed from service/first by Wagner and later by Kazim Beg. He suggests that anything found upon Ahmad should therefore be regarded as suspicious and his statements received with caution. But much of the information contained in Wagner’s « despatch is known to be true, and it is more likely that Wagner seized the opportunity to send a commufiication even while he may have doubted the probability of its arrival at destination. 18. A caravan en route for Meshed carrying wool in which was hidden a large consignment of cash was stopped by Faiz Muhammad Khan, Commandant of Kafir Kalah. The camelman gave him 11,000 krans upon which he allowed them to proceed, and later distributed part of the bribe among various officials of Kuhsan. The news reached Herat, and the Naib Salar has arrested the Commandant. 19. The return to Herat of a former refugee in India, Amir Muhammad Khan, is reported. He was apparently one of the suite of the deceased Sirdar Ayub Khan. 20. The German mentioned in paragraph 28 last week is, as was supposed, an escaped prisoner of war. Wagner sent Bayerl to Chahar Bagh at the request of the Naib-ui-Hukumah, and he returned with this information. Subsequently Wagner induced the Naib to allow this man to reside with him, claiming him as a former acquaintance. &gt; 21. On 29th ultimo Kazim Beg paid a long and secret visit to the Naiz Salar. 22. On the same day Wagner attended a parade of troops in company with some Austrians. While returning he gave offence by passing through a cemetery I instead of taking the main road. . 23. Kazim Beg has announced to his servants his definite intention to leave Afghanistan after Nauroz. 24. The German mentioned as having newly arrived states that the escape of prisoners from Russian custody is easy and that many would come to Afghanistan if thy could be sure of good treatment there. (I have brought this to M. Nicolsky s notice.) 25. It is reported that Wagner constantly receives letters from Kabul. 26. Our agent has explained to the Naib-ul-Hukumah the case of Haji Ghulam Hussain (paragraph 32 of Diary No'. 4). The Naib expressed gratitude to us for treating him well and sending him back, but was much displeased to hear that ne had been the bearer of letters from the German party. He announced his intention of issuing strict orders on the subject.27. There is now a rumour in Herat, originated by Kazim Beg, that Mabendra Pertab is dead, but no details are given. 28. Condition of the Country.—Vide paragraph 33 of Diary No. 4. The Chief of Bujnurd lias made further arrests among Khuddu’s men and has recovered certain stolen property, which he is arranging to return to the owners. The Governor of Darajez is also said to have made some arrests in this connection. 29. The presence of robber bands on the Yezd-Tabas road is reported.* His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. G, M.

A formal document has been drawn up providing for his recall at once in case either instalment is not paid on its due date. 12 Russian affairs.—The relations between the Kussian Consulate and the Military establishment are still deplorable and it seems to be impossible to bring about a rapprochement. They appear to require fixed rules of precedence to which all are bound to adhere. 13 Vide paragraph 10, last week, enquiry into the attack by Russian Cossacks upon the Maliyah Treasury continues. M. Nicolsky informs me that General Sukorkin at present here on inspection duty had come mainly m this connection. 14 Secret —A telegram has been received by the Karguzar from Tehran enouirirg into the arrest by Russians of German and Austrian “ refugees ” on the Khorassan border. Special enquiry is made regarding a German named “ Shaksi.” The Karguzar is directed to report the number of such refugees, their names, etcetera, and why they were not sent to Tehran. He has visited M. Nicolsky on the subject. 15.1M. Taharoff, the newly appointed Russian agent at Darajez, left Meshed on Monday to take up his post. 16. Persian and German intrigues. —It is reported that some democrats are included in the number of Persian officers appointed to the new Ccssack brigade at Meshed -and that they have been instructed by the Tehran Committee to work among the men in the interest of the society. M. Nicolsky will be informed, and effort will be made to discover the names of .the officers. 17. News from Turbat-i-Jam.— U. Mikhailoff (paragraph 15, last week) was still in Jam on 12th instant. It is reported that M. Pqpobi is to be relieved at once, but we have no news regarding the result of Mikhailoff’s enquiry. The Ilbaigi Kaudani, who apparently was awaiting the letter from us despatched some days ago saying that there was nothing for him to fear, has not yet appeared before the Consul. Unfortunately the latter has complicated matters by sending threatening messages to him and to,Mir Baqi Sultan through Shaji-us-Saltanah whom he has also upbraided for not causing their attendance when required. 18. News from Herat. —Two (Persian) inhabitants of Turbat-i-Haidari are reported to have proceeded to Kabul to visit the Amir. 19. A large purchase of medicine for the Herat Military Hospital has been made from India by the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 20. An effort is being made by the Naib-ul-Hukumah to increase the educational movement in Herat, particularly as regards the religious education of boys. 21. The Mehmandar of Wagner’s house in Bagh-i-Kartah has reported that some of the German party go out occasionally unattended by an escort. The Naib has given fresh and strict orders to the Captain of the guard in this connection. 22. Three musicians which Wagner’s household had engaged to perform for them on the 8th instant were arrested and imprisoned by the Naib-ul-Hukumah for having gone to the Bagh-i-Kartah. 23. Wagner seffit to the Naib Salar what was represented as being a map of the Persian localities actually in Turkish hands, and asked for it to be returned to him. He then sent a photograph of the map to the Naib-ul-Hukumah who returned it as undecipherable and asked for the original. This Wagner would not give. 24. Condition of the country. —A robbery is reported from Baghshan near Nishapur ; a party of 12 men attacked a carriage and carried off the horses and property of the travellers who were compelled to make their way to Meshed on foot. 25. A caravan proceeding to Kerman from Kain was robbed at Dahanai Hur. All the property and merchandise being carried off and one man being killed. 26. One thousand and seven hundred sheep were plundered from Shir Tafah near Sarakhs by an Afghan Baluch robber gang, but prompt action by loca sowars recovered the greater number. W. G.

Germans and adherents.—The arrival of a - German ” in Bukharan dress from Bala Murghab is reported by the Herat Agent who is instituting en- qumes as to identity* The individual in question has been accommodated in the Bagh-i-Shah. The Colonel of the Kandahar! paltan, having been called over the coals by .he Naib salar on account of criticism of the drill of his battalion made by \ agner, is reported to be furiously angry with the latter. According to a statement, hitherto unconfirmed, made by an arrival at Herat from Maimana, Mohend.ro Partap recently crossed the Russian frontier at a point between Andkhui and Maimana The Russians, both civil and military, have been informed of the report. The latter are telegraphing both to the Governor-General at Tashkent and to the Governor of Transcaspia, and, / inriA r i j. . io: s l:r iG I — l ' 0 - 24 M C cj MAR 79 77as intelligence lately reached me that Mohendra had been visited at Dehdadi br Hindu (said to be Kajput) traders from Bokhara, a look-out will he kept in that quarter also. 57. Cavalry .—The Naib Salar recently caused the number of men of the Turki Bisala on parade to be checked according to the parade-state of the corps, and finding that 20 men were absent, fined the Colonel and Major a month’s pay each, and subordinate officers half month’s pay. 58. Inspection .—According to a statement of the Naib Salar a superior officer from Kabul is expected at Herat to carry out an inspection of the garrison. 59. Armament .—In reply to a representation from Commandants of infantry battalions that new “ German ” rifles received from Kabul should to avoid jealousy among the troops, be issued to one Company of each batta lion and not in toto to any battalion in particular, the Naib Salar stated that he intended to issue these rifles to Kabuli battalions, and not to the Heratis who drew their pay from the Afghan but prayed for the Persian Government. 60. Medical .—Instructions have been given for five intelligent and educa ted men per battalion to be taught first-aid for use in the field. Men selected will be paid as Kot Dafa lars and may exp ect promotion to officers rank for good work. Russian Turkistan. 61. Turkoman Cavalry Regiment .—Several Turkoman officers have been awarded the Order of St. George for gallantry in the fighting on the Western Pront last June, the senior, Lieutenant-Colonel Uraz Berdy, for leading the 2nd Division of the regiment in a charge which resulted in the destruction of two enemy companies and the capture of a battalion. 62. Military labour.—Smts employed on Russian railways and at Petro- grad and Moscow works are reported to be working well and to face the winter without difficulty. Meshed ; The 3rd Tebruary 1917. E. A.

F( l rce '— A circumstantial rumour is prevalent that the Yomut Turkomans have received a severe defeat at the hands of the Eussian Gurgan force, many being reported to have been killed by guns and machine guns and numerous captures to have been made. As all previous rumours “ ha T, e . reacll ® d have ascri bed exaggerated reverses to the report 3 ^ 1§ pC)SSlb 6 that thers ma ^ be some foundation for the present No report however, of an engagement had reached the Russians up to yesterday. Although this is not surprising in view of the extraordinary lack of communication which prevails between various Eussian detachments, we may perhaps expect to hear something in the present instance, as General .Loginov telegraphed at my suggestion some weeks ago requesting to be kept informed of any events of importance. ° u &amp; vpi 31. Arms traffic .—The following explanation is given for the Lee-Enfields (paragraph 16) at Tehran. They were said to havejbeen brought there by muja heddin enlisted by the Turks at Kirmanshah and armed with captured British rifles. 30 of these men deserted to Tehran with their arms, (A letter appeared J[ 0D i a correspondent in a Eussian paper about two months ago stating that the lurks had attempted to form several battalions from Kurds and local levies but that the men had practically all deserted with the arms supplied to them.) J1 Hajji Hussain Agha informed us some days ago that an English rifle had come into his possession and on our visiting him and inspecting it it proved to be the modern short Lee-Enfield pattern. He stated that it was the only one in his ^ possession, and he was willing to act in any manner indicated regarding it. I am informed, however, that he has purchased 4 in, all. Our ^ efforts are directed to discovering the name and address of the consigner in Tehran with a view to a seizure being effected. Hajji Hussain Agha is a very large land-owner, and he stated with perfect frankness that he would take as many of such rifles as he could obtain for the guards on his estates. 3-. Enquiry .—It was stated that M. Mikhailov would be present at Tuibat-i-Shaikh Jam by the 11th instant to open the enquiry referred to in paragraph 15. The Military Agent informs me, however, that no news of his arrival there-has been received, and that as far as is knowa he had not left Turbat-i-Haidari two days ago. It is obvious that the longer the delay, the more difficult such an enquiry will prove. Herat and Afghanistan. 33. Germans and adherents .—Further reports point to the strict guarding of the German party, and their isolation from any intercourse with the population. Wagner is reported to be attempting to get into touch with prisoners of war in Eussian Turkistan, and to regret the loss of useful informa tion occasioned by the deportation of Sayyid Mustafa Arab. According to Eussian information he has frequently despatched messengers to Bokhara and the principal centres of Russian Turkistan with the object of fomenting sedition against Eussian rule, and Kazim Beg and Barakatuila are said to assist in this task. Saidar Kurban Muhammad, alias the Yomut Sardar Junaid much wanted by the Russians for his share in the Bokhara disorders of last February, has been forbidden by the Naib-ui-Humumst to hold intercourse with Kazim Beg and, by implication, with the German party. Le Dated Peoslv: j. 9 [virusi 7 3 APR 1917) 2 . t Kazim Beg, when riding through a village on the outskirts of Herat rebuked the villagers for failing to salute him. They replied that they were forbidden to hold any communication with the German party, on which he was heard to observe to the Jemadar of his escort that the village was too near to Herat ard must be removed. In view of the known fact that the proximity of certain villages and gardens to Herat would mask the advance of an attacking force and militate against the defence of the city it appears probable that a reason for the remark other than pique, may exist. Kazim Beg has witnessed the exercises of the troops and remarked on them ; it is possible that the Naib Salar may be utilising such military knowledge as his guest possesses. Certain pilgrims who have recently arrived from Mazar-i-Sharif at Meshed state that three weeks ago an Indian of consequence with several Indian servants was domiciled near Hehdadi, and that no indications of his approaching depar ture were apparent. The Afghan authorities treated him with the greatest respect, and bad assigned the kotwal of the city to him as mihmandar. Although the pilgrims -were unacquainted with his name, there seems little doubt that the individual in question must be Mohendro Partap, particularly as no intelligence of his presence elsewhere has come to hand. 34. Munitions. —On the 7th instant a caravan of 240 camels under mili tary escort reached Herat from Kabul. 220 of these carried small arms ammunition, the exact nature of which is at present in doubt, but the number of which is given at 74,900 rounds. Detachments from [farah accompanied the convoy, returning on completion of the duty. According to the statement of the officer in charge, a further convoy (by implication also destined for Herat) of 400 camels should have reached Kandahar on about the same date. This convoy includes rifles, small arms ammunition, binoculars, tarpaulins for guns, and drill for uniforms, At the suggestion of Wagner the Kaib Salar has ordered an inventory of the contents of the Arsenal to be made, with a view to ascertaining how much of the stores were worthless. 35. Discipline — A Havildar, detected in filching firewood from the Gov ernment supply, has been dismissed and deported to Kabul. 36. Training —The Commandant of the Kandahari battalion having reported that his men w ere so untrained that the firing of the musketry practice ordered would only result in a w r aste of ammunition, the battalion was put back for a week’s aiming drill before going to the range. Six field-guns have been horsed and taken out for drilL It is expected that the Kaib Salar will shortly order gunnery practice. 37. Recruiting. —Orders have been issued for tire enlistment of 40 gipsies as buglers. 38. Medical. —Two surgeons and a physician employed at the Government Hospital have resigned in preference to serving under the Indian doctor. Russian Turkistan. 39. Military labour. —The rigours of the Russian winter have necessitated considerable expense in the provision to the native wmrkmen of w r arm clothing, felt b^ots, etc. Civil officers in charge of districts from which Turkoman guards have been taken will also, according to a recent order of General Kuropatkin, find their labours increased by inquiring into the family circumstances of the kin of men recruited for this purpose, arranging for the cultivation of lands for which sufficient working hands have not been left and kindred measures. E. A. E. REDL, Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staff Officer. 1 (2 the natives in the villages which he visits, and the Naib-ul-Hukumat is said to have reported him to the Amir. He is anxious to secure the services of per sons well acquainted with routes in the Qainat. In confirmation of the report of Mazar-i-Sharif pilgrims mentioned in paragraph 33, certain Berberis here who left Mazar during the 1st week of the current month state that an Indian of consequence, generally known as the « Rajah,’* was then domiciled at Dehdadi with his Indian servants and that there was no talk of his departure. 47. Fay and allowances .—The rumour that the Xaib Salar has recom mended to the Amir that the grain issued to troops should not in future he deducted as at present from their pay, has caused rejoicing—possibly prema ture—among the men. 48. Recruiting .—Difficulty in obtaining voluntary recruits at Herat is ascribed partly to the dislike of the population to military service, and partly to the fact that natives of other Provinces who formerly enlisted at Herat are now being recruited in their own districts. 49. Equipment .—Uniforms for the Khaki battalion have been completed and issued, but orders have been given that they are not to be taken into wear till the whole garrison is supplied. Russian Turkistan. 50. Supplies .—The report on the harvest and condition of live stock in Turkistan during 1916 shews a falling off from former years due in part to unfavourable climatic conditions, and in part to want of labour, to which deficiency damage occasioned by locusts is also ascribed. Conditions haTe been more favourable generally in Semirechia than in other provinces, but it is probable that the disorders in that province.w 7 ill have to a great extent nullified the more favourable weather conditions. Both horse and sheep breeding has been below the average generally and many young animals have died. The grain harvest has been poor and in some districts did not furnish sufficient seed for the next sowing. The yield of most kinds of fruit has been distinctly below the average, and in no case has a favour able result been secured with the exception of grapes which have been abundant and of good quality. Cotton has also been adversely affected by the weather and a decrease of 30 per cent, on the crop of 1915 has been practically universal, while the quality is noted as inferior. The rice crop has also fallen below that of former years. E. A. E. BEDL, Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staff Officer. Meshed ; 1 The 27th January 1917.$ 3. G. P. I., Pelhi.—Ni. 1S87 C. G.

Meanwhile local agitation proceeds at Kuckan for his return. 3. paragraph 2 of Diary No. 2 . Naiyir-ud-Daulah. who appears to have ? u ( ^ overnorsill P of Niskapur, has dismissed his grandson Fateh-us- tan ah from the post and appointed a younger brother, Shahzadah Buzurg in 4. One Mirza Husain Khan recently came from Tehran armed with orders that he was to be appointed Rais-i-Gendarmah in Meshed. The present Rau, Husain Kub, appealed to both Consulates, with whom he is friendly, for assistance,' and the appointment of Mirza Husain was annulled. The latter however attempted on the 21st instant to take charge of the post by force, assisted by three gendarmes. This was prevented, and Mirza Husain and his assistants have been deported for their impudence and sent out to Turuk under escort en route for Tehran. 5. Persian affairs .— In acknowledgment of good services recently rendered by the Governor of Tabas in connection with the suppression of outlawry. Tun and Bijistan have been transferred from the Government of Turbat-i-Haidari to that of Tabas of which they formerly formed a part. 6. Referring to the incident reported in paragraph 23 last week, the Governor General has proposed that the Persian Government should discuss the frontier situation with that of Afghanistan and that the latter should be asked to deliver up Muhammad I mar Khan, the robber chief, together with the property plundered by him from the Taimuris. 7. Intrigues in the Shrine against the Mutwali Bashi have resulted in the deportation of certain minor officials by order of His Majesty the Shah. 8. The Chief of Bujnurd has presented 1,000 gold five-kran pieces to the Minister of the Interior, from whom he has received a letter accepting the present and eulogising the Chiefs recent work in connection with Khuddu and his men. 9. T ids paragraph 24 of last week's diary. The Governor-General has written to the Minister of the Interior praising Shuja-ul-Mulk's energy and suggest ing the despatch of an acknowledgment to him by the Central Government. I have received a warm letter cf thanks from the A' aib-ul-Huhimah of Herat in respect of our share in these matters. 10. Yids paragraph 1 of last week's diary. Sirdar Makhsus has been called to Meshed. This is probably the best course possible for the settlement of the question, in which, as previously stated, we are not personally interested. 11. Russian affairs. —M. de Beauvais leaves at once for Russia on leave. M. Samsonov (paragraph 6, last veek), having fallen out with M. Nicolsky, returns to Pet re grad forthwith. 12. News has been received by the Russian Consulate-General from Askabad of the recent escape into Persia from Merv of two Austrian prisoners. One has been recaptured here and made over to the Russian Consulate-General. 13. All Russian subjects have been instructed to submit to their Consulate statements of losses directly due to the war. Le__r. Dat.i 9 3 ao iv. out/ APRici/ v •W.14. Vide paragraph 7, last week. The arrival of some Yamut Turkomans at Bujnurd having been reported, enquiry into the number is being made at the instance of M. Nicolsky. 15. Persian and German Intrigues.—Vide paragraph 10 of last week’s diary. Subscriptions are being systematically levied from all democrats in Meshed, accord ing to means and position, for the purchase of the arms which are expected shortly to arrive. Our enquiries as to the places from which they are to come and the route to be taken have not yet produced any result. 16. The Police have arrested a Tabrizi Turk named Meshedi Kazim who states that he was enlisted by the Germans in Luristan as a sowar and deserted from Hamadan taking with him money in gold to the value of between three and four hundred tumans. He has been released on payment of 100 tumans to the Nazmiah Department, and will be summoned to this office for an interview. 17. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—The cause of Sirdar Makhsus is being warmly espoused by M. Mikhailoff, the Russian Consul, who is trying to induce the com plainants against him at Meshed to withdraw 7 their objections. 18. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—A case of oppression towards a Herati resident of Jam is reported. Habib Ullah, brother of the Governor Shaji-us- Saltanah who is absent in Meshed, on arrival settled the matter satisfactorily, but the local Naib-ul-Hukumah has been warned for the future. 19. Vide paragraph 12 of last week. Finding that M. Nicolsky had done nothing I approached Colonel Guestchen on the subject of the return of the llbaigi Kaudani to Persia. He appeared to be doubtful as to the probability that the llbaigi would behave correctly towards us in future, but now we hear that he has been ejected from Afghanistan, the only condition on which They would allow him to remain there being that of becoming an Afghan subject, which he naturally declined to do. This climax wull probably secure his devotion to us and I am arranging to call him to Meshed without delay with the help of Mir Baki Sultan and Shaji-us-Saltanah, the latter of whom may be relied upon to help us in the matter. 20. After much delay, the reason for which is not apparent, M. Mikhailov, Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari, is said to have left for Jam to enquire into the case of Skaji-us-Saltanak and the agents, Popoff and Lemansky. I have sent him the vernacular papers connected with the case to assist him in the enquiry. 21. News from Karez. —Khan Sahib Allah Din Khan, the newly appointed British Agent, arrived on the 18th Janury. 22. It is reported that he has captured an Isfahani servant of Wagier, and details are awaited. 23. News from Herat.—Vide paragraph 19 above. It seems that every in ducement was held out to the Ilba ; gi Kaudani to persuade him to become an Afghan subject, but without success. He interviewed the British Ag^nt outside the town of Herat before leaving ; and undertook to give written assurances of good b3- haviour and special devotion to British interests in future, pointing out that he must leave Afghanistan, that he dared not go to Russian territory, and that there fore his only hope was in ourselves. 24. Under orders from the Amir a new 7 town council has been formed for the settlement of important local cases. It comprises representatives of all official and private services and communities. 25. It is reported from Kushk that five Turkomans coming over the border were fired upon by the Russian frontier guards. One was killed and the others taken back to Russ'an territory. Some difficulty is found in dealing successfully with the emigration movement. Two more families have arrived at Gulran and have been ordered to be sent to Herat. 26. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has issued orders that all emigrants or deported persons from Russian territory who are not Afghan subjects should be sent to their own countries.3 onuit^j retell oil| iontoiislk of MB: . 27. It is seems that the “ Representatives of the People ” whose presence in Herat was reported in Diary No. 21 of 20th May last have, with a few exceptions, been excused from further attendance. This is believed to mean that the speciai circumstances which caused their attendance have ceased to exist. 28. The British Agent heard on the 13th that Wagner and his servants had attempted to arrest a man who visited the Bagh-i-Kertah, supposing him to be a British secret agent. They were net successful in catching him. 29. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has reported to the Amir concerning Wagner that | he is not a desirable person and recommending that his stay at Herat should ; terminate. The chief complaint against him seems to be that he enters villages ? and tries to enter into conversation with the people upon unsuitable subjects. 30. There are signs that the German party intend to choose a new route by which to send messengers and possibly to travel themselves. Nasrullah, Wagner’s servant, and Kazim Beg are both repoxted to have been enquiring of the route via Kain and the latter attempted without success to bribe a Kami to go on a journey for him. 31. Wagner has received a letter from Kabul detailing German victories, with which he is much pleased. He has duly read it to the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 32. Enquiries have been made by the Naib-ul-Hukumah regarding the arrest of Haji Ghulam Husain (paragraph 29 of Diary No. 1) from the Mehmandar or Major-domo of the Bagh-i-Kertah. He replied that he had heard of the arrest but did not know whether the Haji was the bearer of letters or not. (We have reported the whole case to our Herat Agent for the information of the Naib.) Enquiry is still proceeding in this case ; an important witness is at Samarkand and steps will be taken to call him to Meshed. Meanwhile Haji Mahmud Herati and his friends have been released on bail. 33. Condition of the Country.—Vide paragraph 25 of last week’s diary. Energetic measures in dealing with Khuddu’s gang on the part of the Chief of Bujnurd have continued during the week, and tire people of Shirwan district are much pleased and relieved. 34. Thefts in Meshed town have been somewhat frequent of late. On the night of the 21st instant goods worth Tumans 1,500 were taken from a shop in the Pain Khiaban, and last night (26th) an attack by some Russian Cossacks upon the Revenue treasury is reported to have resulted in the loss of several lives. This serious occurrence will be reported in detail next week, when full particulars have been received. Meshed : W. G.

Thomas, Army Veterinary Service, Major R. T. McEnery, Supply and Transport Corps, and Captain W. LeC. Brodrick, 61st Camel Corps, arrived at Sistan from Saindak. February loth .— 2nd-Lieutenant F. Dewar, 19th Punjabis, arrived at Sistan from Bandan. The Governing Family of Sistan and Kainat. I have heard from His Majesty’s Minister that Shaukat-ul-Mulk was to leave Tehran for Meshed on the 16th instant. He will probably not reach Birjand before Nauroz. The Karguzar of Sistan. His Majesty’s Minister has informed me that Fakhir-ud-Dauleh has been nominated for the appointment of Karguzar in Sistan. He is accompanying Shaukat-ul-Mulk as far as Birjand. Afghan Gun Runners. A report, still unconfirmed, reached me on the 6th instant that a caravan of i arms and ammunition wrapped in jawals from the Persian Gulf passed through fields south of Warmal and Lutak at midnight of the4th-5th instant and crossed the border into Afghanistan opposite Kala Fath. The gun-runners were only seen by one cultivator, whom they nearly killed. Various spies who have since come in from Afghanistan have estimated the composition of the caravan at 50 men and 200 camels. It has been suggested that the caravan was really identical with one which i had recently smuggled rice across the border into Sistan for sale and had left by ! a round about route to return to Kandahar, avoiding the populated tract of Afghan Sistan, the officials of which district were likely to punish them for their breach of ! the law of Afghanistan. I was for some time inclined to believe this suggestion to ^ be correct, but am now very doubtful about it. German Emissaries. It has been reported that two “ Germans ” arrived at Kala Kang on about the 6th instant from Bampur. Their guides are said to have been Kadkuda Mirak, the notorious gun-runner (see my Diaries Nos. 6 of 1914 and 42 of 1915) and two other Kudbedanis of Deh Mirak in Chakhansur. !C3NFIDENTIAL. % y 12 7 9 1917 Meshed Diary No. 3, for the week ending the 20th January 1917. t A' ^f rs ^ an officials.—T ide paragraph 1 of last week’s diarv. A new candidate for the Governorship of Turbat-i-Haidari has appeared in the person of the yoimg son of the Governor-General, whom his father wishes to appoint, with a suitable Peshkar to assist him. A mulla of Turbat has died suddenly in suspicious circumstances, and is believed to have been poisoned by an agent of Sirdar Makhsus. The matter is thus unsettled. nr n 2 ' Governor m Sistan having been restored to Shaukat-ul- Mulk, msam-ud-Daulah has been asked by a friend in Tehran whether he would accept the Governorship of Turbat-i-Haidari or Tabas. The Russian Consul General and the military staff have renounced their protests against the return of bhaukat on hearing that he is in favour with their Tehran Legation. d r/' 5 of Dla ry No. 1. The question of the Governor-General’s Peshkar has been settled by a division. Mushar-us-Saltanah is to do all the work connected with foreigners and Alam-us-Saltanahthe remamdei*. 4. I have been asked by the Governor-General whether we have any obiection t0 be ^ ng re - a PP omted ^ the Government of Kuchan and have replied that his re-appomtment should be made a means of ensuring the immediate payment of the balance of his debt to the Imperial Bank. This suggestion has been accepted, and the terms are being arranged. 5. Persian affairs. The Governor-General has recommended to Tehran that the system of employing volunteers as Government sowars in outlying places should be changed. Hitherto such persons have been excused payment of revenue in lieu of wages, but it is found that when any work has to be done they decline to move without payment. He now suggests their enrolment, like regular sowars, with fixed salary. 6. Russian affairs. —M. Samsonov, Russian agent with troops, has arrived in Meshed. It is believed that he will act for M. de Beauvais during the latter’s absence on leave to Russia. . 7 - At the instance of M. Nicolsky the Governor-General has telegraphed to the Chief of Bujnurd instructing him not to give asylum to Yamut (Persian) Turko mans who may come into his territory on defeat by Russian troops, and to give all necessary help to the Russian officer who is shortly to be deputed to Bui nurd in this connection. Later news announces the arrival at Bujnurd of a Russian Colonel with 25 Russian Cossacks who intends to visit Shirvan also, with what precise object is not yet known. 8. The Russian Bank at Tehran has re-opened the question of the Kuchan road contract which had been given to the Rais-ut-Tujjar of Meshed and leased by him to them. The Karguzar is protesting strongly against the lease, and urges that the repairs to the road should be effected by the Government and that the contract should not be leased to foreigners. 9. The Karguzar has received a telegram from the Foreign Minister pointing out that certain arms which were confiscated by the Russians from revenue sowars in Khorasan have not yet been recovered, and urging him to act in the matter. 10. Persian and German Intrigues. —A circular was issued at the last weekly meeting of democrats which dealt with the result of an enquiry which the Russians are supposed to have made in certain places in Khorasan into the conduct of their officials in reporting various persons as p-o-German. The circular states that it was proved to the satisfaction of the inspecting officer that these charges were falsely made as a means of levying blackmail on the persons charged. Our secret agent has been informed that a number of revolvers and other small arms are shortly to be smuggled into Persia from Merv and other places in Turkestan, (M. Nicolsky has been informed.) ’ y Lu J j yj J\ /Vo’ • | t ; rr-M —. A •Ail 1 '°' 18 l s| ip 2 MAR] qi y j \J deceived2 11. Enquiries are being made regarding the identity of the Persian priest who is mentioned in paragraph 7 of Kabul Diary for 22nd November last as beins 0 his way to visit the Amir. It is believed that no one has yet gone for thispurno n but suspicion falls upon one Agha Shaikh Hasan Kashi of Meshed who is knownT’ be a p’o-Usmani. His movements will be carefully watched. 12. News from Hera*.—The arrival of 10 more Turkoman families under one Beg Nazir is reported from Kushk. The leader has been summoned to Herat M. Nicolsky has been informed of this fresh emigration. 13. Vide paragraph 18 of last week’s diary. It is reported that the road work at Hazar Jarib is completed and arrangements are now being made to bring trees from Khaf for the construction of avenues. ^ 14. Vide paragr aph 21 of Diary No. 1. The three Austrians were despatched to Kabul on the 6th instant, having been provided with animals and a mstin each. ^ 15. Owing to Nasrullah, Wagner’s servant, having abused a man while in a state of intoxication, the Naib-ul-Hukumah has issued orders limiting the issue of intoxicants to Wagner and ordering the supply to be made in future through the Kotwal. 16. Wagner is reported to be extremely vexed at the expulsion of Mustafa Arab reported last week. 17. Kurban Muhammad, Sirdar of the Turkoman refugees {vide paragraph 20 of last week’s diary) has been reprimanded by the Naib-ul-Hukumah for speaking to Kazim Beg, and told that Afghan subjects, one of which he has now become, are not allowed to converse with foreigners. 18. Wagner is enquiring for a person who will go on a message to prisoners in Russia, but cannot find anyone willing to go. 19. The iS aib-ul-Hukumah has sent a message to Wagner that when he goes out riding he should not enter any village, and on re-entering the town should keep to the larger thoroughfares. 20. Vide paragraph 22 of Diary No. 1. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has refused to allow Ahmad Barbari to leave Herat. 21. A letter of which the contents have not transpired reached Wagner from an Austrian officer in Kabul on the 10th instant. at ^ le ^ a igi Kaudani (paragraph 17 of Diary No. 1) has arrived at Herat. No favour seems to have been shewn to him at Kabul, but he is now asking our agent to obtain permission from us for his return to Persia. I have referred the question to M. Nicholsky who proposes to consult Colonel Guestchen, by whom the llbaigi was deported last year. It is hoped that an amicable settlement may come of this. J ■ . f rom Turbat-i-Jam. —A fight is reported from the neighbourhood ot Kulah Gak. Habibullah Khan, a brother of the Governor, Shaji -us-Sultanah, v hose house had been robbed by a band of Afghans under one Muhammad Umar Khan, attacked the latter with the help of Mir Baki Sultan. The robbers escaped across the border, but there were several casualties on both sides. 24. News from Karez.—Vide paragraph 28 of Diary No. 1. Shuja-ul-Mulk has sent the remaining seven Afghan robbers to the Governor of Kuhsan. His action m this matter is highly commendable. The letteis r ef erred to in paragraph 29 of Diary No. 1 are still under examination. e T n pw appear to have been forged by Mirza Hasan Khan, British agent, in order o obtain his levenge upon Haji Mahmud for a report which the latter had once made against him. 25. Condition of the country. —The Chief of Bujnurd has at last brought the robber Khuddu to book and scattered his gang. The outlaws fled to Darajez and the Chief s party came upon them near the village of Zein-ud-Dinlu* A fight took place in which three of the Chief’s men were killed while the robbers lost two killed and three men and eight horses captured. The remainder escaped over the border, and the Russians are being asked to effect their capture.'VO &lt; y CONFIDENTIAL.

( l ) /Pe suspect, Saiyid Mustafa, mentioned in numerous Meshed Diaries crossed border from Raia K an g into Mian Kangi on the 6th instant. He had attached himself with his two horses to a Persian Naib named Muhammad Akram &gt;*ho had been visiting Kala Kang on official business. The Deputy-Governor of Mian Kangi arrested the Saiyid and sent him in to the Deputy-Governor of Sistan T C f IT 6d t 11 ? ° n t0 me - The Sai ^ id tried t0 take refuge with the chief Mujtehid of Sistan, but received no encouragement from the latter. The prisoner claims to be a Persian subject and a resident of Muhalla Bayat hiraz, m which much Turkish is spoken. The Karguzar, at my invitation, has ^een the man and expressed the opinion that his mother tongue is Turkish The bnirazi retired Dragoman of this Consulate declares that the Saiyid cannot have resided long in Shiraz. The Saiyid calls himself the son of Saiyid Sulaiman, Imam- ■i-Juma, of Deb Dasht near Bushire. He was born in Najaf, studied in Cairo and has resided in Bombay 13 years and in Peshawar about eight months He used to sell medicines in Bombay and became bankrupt. He now professes to be a writer of prayers and charms as well as a physician. His age is about 50 He wore an Afghan dress until he crossed the border, and then changed into that of a Persian baiyid. He declares that he has had no truck with the Germans in Afghanistan and suggests that we are mistaking him for the Tehrani Saiyid Reza. (2) I am informed that there are now no Germans in three who were there having returned to Herat. Chakhansur, the last The Governing Family of Kainat and Sistan. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has had a conversation by telegraph from Tehran with Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan. He has informed the latter that at his request the Persian Government have conferred on the Sartip the title Samsam-us-Saltaneh. Another subject said to have been discussed was the expediency^of divorcing the Sartip’s betrothed wife, the daughter of Ehtisham-i-Humayun, who was Karguzar here in 1912. The Sartip, I think, would willingly do'this if he could recover the 3,500 Tomans which he professes to have paid to the father-in-law. News from Afghanistan. It is rumoured that the troops of Kandahar have been suppressing a rebellion in Pusht-i-Rud and^ Nauzad. Chiefs named Masum Khan, Aslam Khan and Hatam Khan are said to have been killed or arrested. The Zamindawar District is also said to have been subjected to punitive measures and two of the chiefs are said to have fled into Persian Khorassan. Tribal affairs in Sistan. The Karguzar has been trying to put pressure on Sardar Haji Khan, son of Khan Jehan Khan, Sanjarani, to pay up the balance of a fine due to the members of an Afghan tribe on account of the murder of a man two years ago. He has quarrelled with the Deputy-Governor over the case, and has informed me that the latter has only one object in view, viz., to take bribes. 1 o. ig 2 MA:;19i7 29 MAR 1917SCERET. 1181 ,ty cfr INTELLIGENCE SU tlMARV NUMBER 2 FOR tHfr-WEEK ENTOfli THE 13th JANUARY 1917. Khorasan and North-East Persia. ,, G ^ 3 - Russian force.—General Loginov left for Astrabad vid Askhabad on tne otn January. Prior to leaving when representing the insufficiency of his force m Khorasan he had requested to be supplied with a second Cossack regiment and if possible with a battery, or to be permitted to occupy the line lurbat-i-Haidan-Gaudan only. He was informed that no extra troops could be supplied him, and that he must continue to occupy the same line as neretoiore m the best manner possible under the circumstances. 14 Cossack Brigade.—Cwptam Sergieev, 1st Turkistan Eifle Regiment attached to the Persian Cossack Brigade, has arrived with a small advanced P a 'y trorn Tehran. Colonel Mamonov, who is to command the new Astrabad and Khorasan divisions of this force, with headquarters at Meshed, is expected shortly with a nucleus and staff for organising local recruitment. 15. Enquiry—The Russian agents at Kariz and Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam, in conjunction with the British agent at Kariz, have been implicated in an at tempt to blackmail Shajji-as-Saltana, Governor of Jam, the British agent has been suspended and brought to Meshed for investigation of the charge against him, and the Russian military authorities, who control the above mentioned agents, have arranged for an enquiry on the spot into the conduct of their agents by M. Mikhailov the Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari. The Russian agent at Kariz, Popoff, is a Sotnik of the Taman Cossack Regi ment, the Jam agent, Lemanski, a civilian. (Reference Intelligence Sum mary, 7th October, paragraph 2.) 16. Arms traffic .—Hajji Ghulam Hussian (paragraph 101,1916) is report ed to be receiving rifles by postal waggon concealed in bales of tobacco. The Provincial Director of Customs is unable to take any action in the matter as far as internal Persian traffic is concerned, and the only chance of confiscat ing them is to receive accurate intelligence as to when and where they will be smuggled out of the country. As arms are concealed in Meshed in small numbers in various houses, all transactions conducted with the greatest secrecy, the police “ squared ” when necessary, and despatch carried out in small quantities by various caravans, discovery is not easy. It is reported that “ English ” rifles, apparently Lee-Enfield have been brought to Tehran from Kirmanshah in some numbers, and a few have been sent here as patterns. One is said to have been sold recently to a Gendar merie officer for 70 tomans, taken back from him, and finally sold to Hajji Hussain Agha for 120 tomans. At such prices quite a considerable amount of villainy may be expected. The matter is being watched. 17. Police measures .—The Rais-i-Nazmia has issued strict orders to all keepers of caravansarais that the arrival of all strangers is to be immediately reported. If strictly insisted upon—a doubtful contingency—the effect will be useful. 13. Suspect .—Information having been received from the Karachi police confirmatory of the account given of himself by Hashim Ali (paragraph 113, 1916), the man has been released, and in view of his destitute circumstances, assisted by the Consulate-General. Afghanistan and Herat. 19. Germans a-.d adherents .—Both from Herat reports and from those of arrivals surveillance over the German party appears strict and the guard at the Bagh-i-Karta has been doubled with this object. Wagner unsuccess fully interceded with the Naib-ul-Hukumat in favour of Sayyid Mustafa Arab wdio has been despatched under escort to Chakansur for deportation to Persia.2 Kazim Beg is reported to be in relations with the refugee Turkoman Sardar, Kurban Muhammad with a view to securing Turkoman guides to cross the frontier. The three Austrians before-mentioned were to be despatched to Kabul on the 7th instant. 20. Corvee. —The inhabitants of Herat and neighbourhood have been ordered to supply 1 man in 5 to clear and level the Hazar Jarib area. Rumours obtain that it is intended to establish a cantonment for the troops there; others that it is a means of discovering numbers for enforced recruiting. 21. Grain collection. —Two Non-Commissioned Officers and 18 men per battalion are to be sent to each of the Herat districts to hasten on the- collec tion and despatch to Herat of the revenue grain. 22. Disposition oj troops. —The Naib Salar has deported two men of in fantry battalions and one artilleryman together with their families to Kabul for having spoken in a discontented manner of prevailing military measures. Considerable discontent is said to prevail among the garrison, which is only kept under by fears of strict punishment by the Naib Salar. 23. Khasadars. —Muhammad Akbar Khan Muhammadzai, Commandant of the Paitan-i-Jadid-i-Kabul has been sent to Bala Murghab to supervise the instruction of the Khasadars on the frontier in drill. The Sartip of Khasadars has been recalled to Herat. 21. Medical —All doctors working in the Government hospital have been ordered to receive instruction in medicine from the Indian doctor. Any who are unwilling to do so must resign. A class of some 25 young men is being instructed by the Indian doctor. Russian Turkistan. 25. Sarakhs affairs. —Turkoman affairs do not appear to be proceeding smoothly. Some 17 malcontents have recently been arrested and sent to Merv and 50 other arrests have been made. Ten families attempting to migrate to Afghanistan have been stopped, and strict orders have been issued that any persons wishing .to change their place of residence must first notify the headman of their village. Roads to the Afghan and Persia a Frontiers are patrolled by soldiers and Turkoman guards, 14 Turkoman smugglers with opium and 4 rifles have been captured, one of the smugglers being killed. 26. Military Labour. —In view of winter General Kuropatkin has post poned the despatch of further parties for work in rear of the armies for one month. 27. Prisoners of war. —The arrival of Tashkent of the American delegate &lt;c Tiding ” is reported, with the object of inspecting the camps for prisoners of war on the C. A. Railway and Andijan Branch. He is also expected to visit Askhabad. 28. Disorders. —45 Turkomans implicated in the disorders at Tejen (para graph 49, 1916) have been tried by Military Court at Ashkabad and 14 of them condemned to death. The sentences have been referred to General Kuropatkin for confirmation. 29. Supplies. —It has been decided to obtain grain from the northern Caucasus to supplement Turkistan supplies. It is stated that a minimum of 300,000 puds monthly has been arranged for. Sarakhs Turkomans are reported to have been called upon to supply a further 150,000 puds. Meshed, 13th January 1917. E. A.

Naiyir-ud-Daulah, formerly Governor-General of this Province, who °? r f® ^^ of Nishapur, has brought about the separation ot tne JN ishapur Nazmiah from that of Meshed and has secured the post of Rais-i- A azmian at Nishapur for Intisar-ul-Mulk, a friend of his own. i* mu ^ as an( ^ P e °ple of Sistan have telegraphed to the Minister of the Anterior an expression of their satisfaction at the return of Shaukat-ul- ulk to the Governorship : but Hisam-ud-Daulah refuses to hand over and has elegraphed to this Consulate-General asking for support. There is much ee mg m Russian circles here on this subject, and joint action has been proposed to me by both the military and civil elements in favour of Hisam. 4. The Governor-General returned our visit on Monday. He was most agreeable and friendly. 5. Persian Affairs.—Vide paragraph 8 of last week’s diary. A Russian Captain, Sirgioff, has arrived in Meshed and the Cossacks are shortly expected. 6. Shaukat-ul-Mulk (paragraph 3 above) is posting jambazan or e&amp;me\-sowars as road guards at Deh Salam, Sarchah, and Bandan on the Afghan frontier; Mizhanabad, Nim Baluk, between Lub-i-Bairang and Hauz, and out to Koh-i- Malik Siah. 7. General unhealthiness is reported from Sarakhs, where much sickness prevails. 8. British Affairs .—The incident reported in paragraph 11 of last week’s diary has been settled by the merchant, Haji Yusuf, paying a fine of Tumans 50 out of which compensation will be paid to the Bank fenash, and offering a suitable apology to the Bank Manager. In the issue of the local weekly journal “ Chaman ” of the 8th instant an article appeared giving an incorrect version of this affair and calling upon the British Consul-General to punish the Bank Manager. The Editor has been instructed to publish a retraction in his next issue, and should this not be satisfactorily done his paper is to be suppressed for a time. 9. A theft took place recently in the shop of the British firm of Gulbankian’s agent, resulting in a loss of cash and property to the value of 450 tumans. The' matter is being investigated, and certain police have been arrested and imprisoned on suspicion. 10. With reference to paragraph 23 of Diary No. 53 for week before last Mirza Hasan, British Agent at Karez, and Mehdi Kuli, our news-writer at Turbat-i-Jam, arrived in Meshed early in the week, and the case of Shaji-us- Saltanah and the money which he was supposed to have borrowed to present to the new Governor-General was thoroughly investigated. Mehdi Kuli, having turned King’s evidence, produced documents in Mirza Hasan’s hand-writing and gave an account of the matter which jointly shewed that the three agents, Mirza Hasan and M.M. Popoff and Lemansky, had been guilty of attempting to extort a large sum of money from Shaji. They had actually realised 7C0 tumans and had divided it among themselves. Mirza Hasan has been suspended, and his case is being referred to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and the Government of India for orders. Khan Sahib Allah Din, lately British Agent at Turbat-i-Haidari, has been despatched to Karez and arrangements are being made to fill his place, which is for the time being the less important of the two. c~ Q rrrs n 1 7 t .o i Lib t b l / oo MAD .0.0 tyi/lll11. Russian Affairs .— Vide paragraph 10 above. The enquiry into the conduct of M.M. Popoff and Lemansky has been entrusted to M. Mikhailov Russian Agent at Turbat-i-Haidari, and M. de Beauvais, whom it was first intended to employ in this work, will go shortly on leave to Russia for some months. 12. Kamran Mirza has received a message of congratulation on his appointment as Governor-General from the neighbouring Russian Governor of Trans-Caspia. 13. Vide paragraph 9 of Diary No. 53. A settlement regarding the export of grain seems likely to be arrived at, as the Karguzar and the Peshkar-i-Malivah have promised us to deal with the matter without delay, and arrangements for the export of 50,000 kharwars are contemplated. 14. The Russian Agent at Darajez has been dismissed and Muhammad Beg Taharoff, a former passport clerk in the Russian Consulate-General here, has been appointed in his place. This is not popular as the people would have' preferred a Russian. 15. Persian and Genmn Intrigues. —There is evidence that the democrats of Meshed are becoming slowly convinced of the hopelessness of their cause. They are attempting to keep up their spirits by the hope that money for the purchase of fire-arms will shortly be supplied by the “ Central National Defence Committed 16. News from Herat.— sixty Turkoman families whose emigration from Russian territory to Bala Murghab was recently reported have been called to reside in the neighbourhood of Herat, by the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who informs them that they must leave the frontier and become permanent Afghan subjects. Some are objecting to this, apparently wishing to remain on the frontier in order to leave Afghanistan when they please : and 22 families are being domiciled at Jayiah near Herat where they have received grants of land. It is reported that the daughter of the Sirdar of these Turkoman emigrants petitioned His Majesty the Czar, stating the grievances of her father and others against Russian officers ; and that His Majesty has ordered certain restitution be made. Hence the desire of many now to return to their former abode. The Sirdar above mentioned is not himself permitted to leave for Russian territory. A aib-ul-Hukmnah has ordered that no Government grain should e c istnbuted in allowances for refugees and others ; such supplies must in future be purchased separately by the Revenue Department. i 1 rV^ &gt;re ^ ara i^ 0ns ^ or building on a large scale are in progress at Hazar Jarib, a oca i y near Herat where it is believed the authorities intend to construct a mi i ary cantonment. Labour has been organised, and levelling and road- makmg are commencing. 19. Saiyid Mustafa Arab, whose arrest was reported last week, was despatched T- e [ scor |' °1 Dyo sowars to Chakansur on the 4th instant, upon the receipt T w 1 ln ^ 0rma ^ 10n Sistan was at once informed by telegram. It is now stated -if n a ^ ner mu ch displeased by this arrest and sent his servant to the Kotwal A 7 °r dK no ^ allow bi m to see the prisoner. Wagner also wrote to the a i 11 U cumah on the subject but the latter declined to modify his orders. i Kazim Beg asked the Turkoman Sirdar mentioned in paragraph 16 repljA iter 3101 *^ 6 &amp; ^ de ^ or b^ m leave Afghanistan. The Sirdar promised to gud,iu over Wagners residence at Ragh-i-Kartan r r ? m ? ser g ean G &amp; jemadar, and 11 men, to a captain, a risaldt a K r n ’ ajlc or( * ers have been issued to watch the Germans with increas care and vigilance. mofrl P' 16 ^bree Austrians mentioned in paragraph 21 of last week’s diary s v 01 va, bul on the 7th. Wagner has provided them with note-books keep an account of their journey.23. Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat Ullah paid Wagner a New Year’s visit on the 1st. It is now said that the former is an Armenian in disguise. The Naib- ui-Hukumah has forbidden any person but the German party to visit him. • i ^Pi growing discredit of Wagner and his companions is generally evident from this week’s report. &amp; j 24. Condition of the Country .—Kuchan and Bujnurd are in a very unsettled condition. Khuddu is still active, and Shuja-ud-Daulah is making energetic efforts to regain the Governorship of Kuchan. That he is responsible for liuddu s activities appears now to be certain, and the steps taken by the Chief oi Bujnurd to capture the robber chief seem to have come to nothing, mainly owing to his supply of ammunition and the armament of his men being greatly interior to those of the robber gang. The position is not improved by the fact that some influential persons in Kuchan are also assisting the outlaws. At the Bujnurd Chief’s request a small and insufficient amount of extra ammunition has been sent to him from Meshed. Meanwhile the collection of revenue in these districts is practically at a stand-still. 25. The Minister of the Interior has telegraphed to the Chief of Buinurd ordering him to arrest Yirdi and Ismail Khan, the murderers of Amir Azam, the Go\ernor of Shahrud, some months ago, who have recently, in company with other desperadoes, raided the village of Damghan.

J The three lately-arrived Austrians are to be sent to Kabul, and it has apparently been decided to deport Sayyid Mustafa Arab to Farak whence he will be sent to Persia. The German party are reported to have passed Christmas day and the dav following m a drunken orgie. J 6 Munitions. Prom a statement made by the Naib Salar at Parbar it appears that a considerable quantity of ammunition, said to include bombs, has been despatched from Kabul for Herat in charge of a Kumaidan • 7 . Far ah. Arrivals at Herat from Parah state that a battalion has been completed there from fresh recruits and that a second is in process of forma tion. 8. Rumoured transfer of troops.—'Faz Naib Salar is credited with the intention of despatching a battalion of infantry and 3 guns to each of the following places : Bala Murghab, Kushk, Ghurian and Ghor. These troops would be relieved from Herat every two months except in the case of Ghor, for which, on account of the distance, reliefs would take place thrice yearly. 10 i 1 Xk ■CL Lz: : ir. io Ft3 ‘i Sil- lS MAR IS?7 Dated2 9. Artillery. —The personnel of each of the 6th reconstituted batteries is given at :— 1 Captain. 2 Jamadars. 24 Havildars. 123 other ranks. To the 24 guns mounted in the fort and at the gates 4 gunners each have been told off. Colonel Walidad Khan, commanding the artillery, and his Kumaidan Muhammad Khan are attempting to secure the additional recruits ordered by the Naib Salar, hut their efforts so far are not meeting with much success. 10. Cavalry. —According to latest information the organization of the cavalry into regiments has been abandoned and they remain as before in independent squadrons. Increase in military activity is only observable in the extra parades which take place. A request by the Xaib Salar, on the grounds of military efficiency, for the relief of the squadron employed on orderly duties was refused by the Naib-ul-Hukumat. Russian Turkistan. 11. Tour. —At the end of December General Kuropatkin passed several days in Transcaspia at Askabad and Merv. It is stated that his visit was connected with new projects for self-governing institutions among the native population. 12. Amu Darya —A few years ago the erosion of the left bank of the Amu Darya above the Charjui railway bridge necessitated the construction of extensive reinforcing works. During the last two years the channel has gradually been changing towards the right bank, and fears of erosion on that side are now entertained. E. A. E. E.EDL, Lieut.-Colonel, * General Staff Officer. Meshed ; 6th January 1917. Erratum .—Last 4 paragraphs in Summary for December 30th should be numbered from 123 to 126.'ij i 921 Meshed Diary No. I lor the week ending the 6th January 1917. I. Persian officials.—Kamvan Mirza, Naib-us-Saltanah, entered Meshed in state on the afternoonof the 2nd instant. On the 4th he was visited by the Russian and British representatives. . ^ ie Karguzar of Meshed seems to be in high favour with the authorities . e ^ ran ’ having again received thanks for good services during the week. He is doing well enough so far as we are concerned. 3. Adal-ud-Daulah, the Governor of Kuchan, having paid peshhush of Tumans 4,000, has been allowed to retain his post, and the new Governor-General has himself telegraphed to the Kuchan community announcing the fact. 4. Kamran Mirza appears now to be disinclined to appoint Sirdar Makhsus (paragraph 15 of Diary No. 53) Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari and has proposed to Tehran to post him at Khaf. This is on account of the feeling of the Mullas against the Sirdar: 5. The question of the new Governor-General’s Peshkar is as yet undecided, Mushar-us-Saltanah and Alam-us-Saltanah (vide Diary No. 53, paragraph 2) having each some powerful supporters. It is immaterial to us who is appointed : Mushar informed me that he cared little whether he were the successful candidate or not. 6. Persian affairs. —The Governor of Nishapur, Fateh-us-Saltanah, has complained to the Home Office regarding the omission of the Revenue Department to pay the wages of the Karasuran (road-guards) of his district. He states that he has paid them from his own funds hitherto but will not continue to do so ; and points out that if he is compelled to dismiss them the Zushki robbers will become still more active. 7. On the 4th instant a riot took place in the Revenue Office to which the police and other Government servants had been summoned to receive their pay. Certain policemen assaulted the Chief Accountant of the police office, accusing him of having embezzled their wages ; but upon the Governor-General promising to enquire into the grievances the rioters dispersed. 8. The arrival at Meshed of 100 Persian Cossacks under a Russian Officer is shortly expected. 9. Najd-us-Saltanah, the local Revenue Commissioner, to whose 'rascality the unnecessary prohibition of grain export referred to in paragraph 9 of last week’s diary appears to be due, is endeavouring to cheat the Government by recommending a substantial reduction in the rent to be paid for the turquoise mines in this neighbourhood.. 10. A telegram reached Meshed on the evening of the 5th instant from the Home Office in Tehran announcing the appointment of Shaukat-ul-Mulk to be Governor of Sistan vice Hisam-ud-Daulah who is recalled to Tehran : and the posting of Misbah Diwan as Deputy Governor of Birjand. His Majesty’s Minister and His Majesty’s Consul at Sistan have been informed without delay. II. British affairs. —On the evening of 29th ultimo a dispute took place in the bazar between aferrash of the Imperial Bank and the young son of a Turk merchant, Haji Yusut Ali; the latter having accused the former of snatching money out of his hand* The merchant’s elder sons turned out and the ferrash was beaten, apparently before his identity was discovered. The police sent the parties to the Bank for the dispute to be settled by the Bank Manager, but the latter was busy and without enquiring in tot he case sent Haji Yusuf and his sons to be imprisoned in the Nazmiah, subsequently reporting the case to us. It is now being settled ; but it has been pointed out to the Bank Manager that he should in future refer to this office in the event of any confinement of Persian subjects being necessary, several protests having been made to the Karguzari against his action in this matter.

The usual durbar of British subjects and proteges was held at His Majesty’ Consulate-General on the 1st January, and the company were entertained at lunch after being addressed briefly on current topics chiefly connected with the war The chief officials of Meshed paid congratulatory visits during the afternoon. 13. Russian affairs. —M. de Beauvais is going at once to Turbat-i-Jam to en quire into the case of Shaji-us-Saltanah and the Russian agents (paragraph 23 of last week’s diary). 14. Secret. —A telegram has been received by the Kargnzar of Meshed from the Karguzar of Bujnurd reporting the arrival there of 30 Russian Cossacks who had come for the purpose of confiscating arms and ammunition. They appear to have collected a considerable amount. A protest from the Chief of Bujnurd to their Commander merely elicited the reply that he was acting under orders from Tashkent. The Bujnurd people beg the Meshed authorities to make protest to the Russian Consul-General here ; and a telegram has also reached our Karguzar from the Tehran Foreign Office instructing him to protest. 15. Mirza Abdur Rahman, whose arrest at Sa’abad was reported in paragraph 26 of last week’s diary, is an agent of Haji Husain Agha, merchant of Meshed and Russian protege. The latter protested to M. Nicolsky regarding his agent’s arrest, but the Consul-General declined to interfere. We allowed Abdur Rahman to be released on bail but he has since been re-arrested in connection with another matter. 16. Persian and German Intrigues.—Vide paragraph 16 of Diary No. 51. It was stated at a meeting of democrats held during the week that the lists of weapons possessed by sympathisers in Meshed were complete, but that no lists had as yet been received from elsewhere. It was agreed to issue a general reminder. Some cypher telegrams have been received by the local democrat committee which have not yet been decyphered. They are believed to be from Enver Pasha. 17. News from tfera*.—The Ilbaigi Kaudani writes to a relative at Herat that the Amir recently received him with affability, and that he hopes soon to be alknved to return to Herat in some good appointment. 18. The Turkomans who had recently come from Russian Panjdehhave been allow ed to bring their families, subsequent to which they are to be given land and to be regarded as Afghan subjects. Eight families of Turkomans have been sent to Karkh by the Naib-ul-HuJcumah, where they are to be granted land and taJcavi allowances. 19. Orders have been received from Kabul for the storage of 2,000 Jcharwars of straw, apparently for some military purpose. 20. M agner and Kazim Beg visited the Naib-ul-HuJcumah on the 22nd* It is not known what passed at the interview. 21 . The Naib has provided clothes for the three Austrians mentioned in paragraph 21 of Diary No. 50 ; and it is believed that they will shortly be sent to Kabul. 22. Wagner’s servants have been quarrelling among themselves, and one Ahmad, a Berberi, is said to have threatened to go to Meshed and give full information there regarding German activities in Afghanistan. He applied for a passport but has not yet succeeded in obtaining one. 23. Maulvi Barkat Ullah and Kazim Beg took lunch with Wagner on Christ mas Day. There is no further news of Mahendra Pertab. 24. Wagner, accompanied by the three Austrians above referred to, visited Hazar Jarib on the 26th ultimo, and on the 27th inspected the fort of Khwajah Ablullah Misri, apparently to the dissatisfaction of the officer in charge.htforlred hfe arrest litlfH, 036 ? 6 r 7 ilIness . tte to Pe rsia ^ Chakhansur. of the Afghan robWs^mentioned^mr^^^o^frr 0 ^ We ^ ave arrestc, -l three to him by Shuja-ul-Mulk, Governor of Rabin, 1 27 °w^ la : Ty No ‘ 50 ; who wiU be sent to strengthen Meshed-Herat relations.

I hear from a spy that three “Germans” escorted by seven Afghan sowars passed through Farah from Herat for Kandahar on about the 22nd instant. One of the principal Enemy agents now at Kala Kang is described as a stout, swarthy man wearing a beard and moustache like Afghan Saiyids and priests 0\er a military shirt and trousers he wears a SaiykLs grey cloak. His turban is black. He knows many languages and calls himself a Turkish Saiyid The more unsophisticated Afghans seem to regard him as a German in disguise. News from Afghanistan. (1) There is a good deal of talkin'Farah about the measures taken in Herat for reorganizing the troops and increasing the armaments along the frontier. (2) It is also said in Farah that the Russians are strengthening the fortifi cations of Shaikh Junaid and digging a moat round the town. (3) See Diary No. 50 of 1916. It is said that the Afghan robbers who raided the sheep from Dureh came from Dasht-i-Bakwa District east of Farah. No restitution has been made yet. The Karguzars of Sistan and Kainat. I hear that Nabil-ud-Dauleh understands that Motasim-us-Sultaneh as well as Rukn-ul-Wizara is to leave this Province. Nabil hopes to get the Sistan appointment, in which case Itisam-ul-Mulk will probably be allowed to remain in Birjand. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain.vv O \ CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. Berciv'Cv- 53 for the week ending the 30th December 1916. HE n; SECR' r % f r 9 K r.isqiQi? 5 i ■ •* 1. Persian officials .—Referring to paragraph 1 of Diary No. 50, the Consulates- General have made representations to the new Governor-General on behalf of the Pais-i-Nazmiah who has received an assurance from His Excellency that he is to continue in office. 2. Alam-us-Saltanah called at this Consulate on the 23rd in company with the Karguzar. He has been brought from Tehran by Kamran Mirza as his Peshkar, but it is as yet undecided whether he or Mushar-us-Saltanah will hold the post. 3. Kashif-ul-Mulk, the Rais-i-Baldiah, has resigned. The appointment was offered by Kamran Mirza to Muddabir-ul-Mulk, who accompanied him from Tehran, but the latter has declined it. 4. Shuja-us-Sultan is to remain on as Governor of Turshiz. 5. Shuja-ud-Daulah (paragraph 9 of Diary No. 50) is making great efforts to be re-appointed Governor of Kuchan. He has offered Tumans 4,000, but Kamran Mirza regards this sum as insufficient for so important a post. There is no doubt that Shuja is responsible for the activities of the robber chief Khuddu in the Kuchan district. 6.. Persian affairs. —Misbah Diwan, the Birjand agent of Shaukat-ul-Mulk, the late Governor of Sistan, has sent Tumans 2,000 and some carpets, etc., to Shaukat at Tehran, which are said to be for the purpose of presenting to the persons whose influence will eventually secure his return to Sistan. 7. Orders have been issued by the Government to enlist 2,000 more men for the Persian Cossack Brigade. 8. The Persian troops specially deputed to Shirwan are on their way back to Meshed, matters being now quieter. 9. Russian affairs. —The Russian Consul-General called upon me on the 27th instant to discuss the question of grain export from Khorassan. He remarked that there was a large quantity of grain both in Meshed town and on the frontier, the export of which would mean no hardship to local people, and that the prohibition which had been made was founded upon incorrect information supplied from here to Tehran in regard to the late harvest, which is represented as having been a bad one. M. Nicolsky asked that particular enquiries might be made by us as his information was that this year’s harvest had been a particularly good one. There is no doubt that this is so, and joint measures will be taken forthwith to secure the removal of the prohibition. The local Rais-i-Maliyah is probably at fault. Turkestan is badly in need of grain at this time. 10. The Persian telegraphist at Nishapur is complaining that the Russian officials there require him to send telegrams to Tashkent and Meshed tree of charge, claiming that they are “ service ” messages. 11 Bad conduct on the part qj the Russian Cossacks who recently arrived in Meshed is reported ; three thefts by them having taken place within the past few days. 12 The Russian Bank is taking urgent steps to recover debts due, and is prepared to compromise with large creditors at a considerable loss. 13 Persian and German Intrigues.— peace question was again discussed at the usual weekly meeting of democrats. Shaikh Jawad, Balur farush, remarked that the Germans would never agree to any peace which left British supremacy at sea unimpaired. He announced his impending departure to Russia on a democratic mission. ^ ft, M. Nicolsky has undertaken to prevent this.) 114. News from Turbat-i-Haidan. —Khan Sahib Allah Din Khan, British agent, has arrived in Meshed.. 15. The question of Sirdar Makhsus (paragraph 2* of Diary No. 51) is not yet settled. The charges against him are to be heard in the local courts and he has been directed to send a representative from Turbat. He has a strong body of supporters. 16. News from Hem/.—The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered all the revenue' grain in his jurisdiction to be collected at Herat with as little delay as possible. 17. Strict orders are said to have been issued by the Amir that the-English word “ hospital ” is not to be used, but invariably the Arabic Dar-ush-Shafa.. 18. Abbas, Wagner’s servant, is dissatisfied, with his master because he gives' him no pay but merely a receipt when it becomes due. He is said to have' determined to leave for Persia if he is not paid in cash by Nauroz. 19. Wagner’s employes have recently been- enquiring for someone who will go on a message.-to Persia for their master, but has as yet found no one although they have offered.an animal as conveyance. They attempted to induce a chemist, Haji Ghulam Husain, whom the Naib-ul-Hukumah is sending to Meshed to buy medicines, to be their messenger, but he declined to have any connection with German intrigues. This man will however be watched on arrival here. The same men are also trying to find a person who will go to Kussian Panjdeh and bring correct news regarding the war. 20. Kazim Beg has offended the Naib-ul-Hukumah and his servants by abusing ajerash whose services the Ndib^uH-Hukumah had lent to him. 21. Referring to paragraph 23 of Diary No. 48 special enquiry in the case of the Austrian who was supposed to have come from India elicits the fact that he is a surveyor who was with the German party in Kabul and came from thence to Herat via Kandahar, giving out falsely that he* had come from India. 22. The six men mentioned in paragraph (c) of Sistan Diary No. 50 are Afghan sowars who were clothed in khaki. 23. News from Karez. —In paragraph 23 of last week’s diary it was reported that Shaji-us-Saltanah, the Governor of Turbat-i-Jam, had raised money locally to provide a large sum for payment to the new Governor-GeneraPas peshkush according to custom ; and in paragraph 30 of Diary No. 51 it was stated that Shaji, in the presence of Mirza Hasan Khan, British agent at Karez, M. Popoff and M. Lemansky, Kussian agents at Karez and Turbat-i-Jam, respectively, had sworn on the Kuran faithfully to serve British and Kussian interests in future. The sum named seems to be an excessive one for peshkush in the case of such a small Governorship and the person from whom Tumans 7,000 was said to have been borrowed, Mehdi Kuli, British news-agent at Turbat-i-Jam, is not a man of any financial position. On the 26th December Shaji himself called upon me with his&lt; brother, having come to Meshed for the purpose. The brother explained that Mirza Hasan Khan, in the presence of Messrs. Popoff and Lemansky, had demanded from Shaji a receipt in favour of Mehdi Kuli for 7,000 Tumans as money lent, threatening him wit deportation to Siberia in the event of refusal, and that they had sworn him to secrecy after extracting the receipt. This account is supported by rumour fror$other sources, and it is unfortunately a more likely story than that put up by Mirza Hasan Khan ; particularly as bha]i has also produced documentary evidence of effort on the part of [Mehdi Kuli. o extract from one of his agents a portion of the amount, in which a threat o deportation to Siberia is definitely made. To facilitate enquiry and prevent collusion and intimidation of witnesses) Mirza Hasan is being recalled to Meshed at once, and Mehdi Kuli is likewise being summoned to bring the receipt in question. Secret enquiries are also emg made regarding the amount of peshkush actually paid by Shaji to the Governo General.24. The British agent, supported by M. Popoff, appeared to have compelled tlie local^Customs officials to allow his sowars to search caravans coming from Herat. This practice, of which the object is suspicious, has been stopped ; and the Director of Customs is being asked to impress upon his men at Karez the need for vigilance. 25. A letter has been received from the British agent forwarding what purports to be a copy of one from a certain Jehangir to the Ilbaigi Kaudani at Herat urging him ta send some Afghans secretly to kill the agents mentioned in paragraph 23 above on account of their conduct towards his friend Shaji-us-Saltanah. This appears to be a plot against Shaji. 26. Mirza Abdur Bahman of Sa’adabad has been arrested by Mirza Hasan and M. Popoff on a charge of arms smuggling, and has been sent with various incriminating letters to Meshed. 27. Condition of the Country. —Robbers, appear to have been fairly quiet during the week. A theft of gold from the post carriage at Sabzawar is reported, and suspicion has fallen upon one Shaukat-us-Sultan, an employe of the Customs, who is to be tried either here or at Tehran.

(1) I hear from Birjand that soon after the announcement of Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s appointment, Madame Boulatov was sent by her husband to call on and con gratulate the new Governor’s mother, on which occasion she remained to lunch ! rL ls evl(ie i lt .that my Russian colleague has been instructed to cultivate verv different relations with His Excellency to those which have existed during the past live or six years. G r (2) Shaukat-ul-Mulk has wired through the British Telegraph Office at Tehran hrs Deputies at both Birjand and Sistan instructing them to make their military distributions for the protection of the Province after full consultation with the British authorities. I have had a preliminary discussion on the subject with Sartiv (now styled by his uncle “ Amir ”) Muhammad Reza Khan, and am satisfied that lor the present the local authorities intend to help us to the best of their ability. (3) Misbah-u.d-IJiwan, the new Deputy-Governor of Birjand, has issued a notification declaring that his master Shaukat-ul-Mulk, and the late Governor Hisam-ud-Dauleh, are on the most friendly terms, and ordering all the adherents of both nobles to live harmoniously with each other. It is devoutly to be hoped tnat Hisam-ud-Dauleh will reciprocate in this policy. I have strongly warned him against encouraging any lawlessness which may bring down upon him the per manent displeasure of the British and Russian Governments. (4) Hisam-ud-Dauleh, when informed of the conclusion of his Governorship, was ordered to proceed up to Tehran. He gained a respite in consequence of the illness of his mother. The lady has now died. I presume that if quiet prevails during the next few months, Hisam-ud-Dauleh will be allowed to remain in Birjand but how the dispute between himself and his half-brother Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan over the distribution of the paternal estates is to be settled locally I cannot see. The question hinges on the validity and genuineness of a will, and in my opinion it can only lie finally settled if both parties go outside the district, or if a strong and impartial commission is sent from Tehran to adjudicate Upon the case. In a Meshed Court I think the Sartip would not have a fair chance. Thirty-one cents of rain fell in Sistan on the 20th instant. In illustration of the mildness of this winter I may mention that the apple trees in our garden all came into blossom several days ago. The Karguzar of Birjand. The Agricultural Prospects. F. B.
