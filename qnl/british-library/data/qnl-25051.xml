Sir, India Office, 15th September 1911. State for India in Council to the expenditure that has been with the concurrence of the connection with the settlement I am directed by the Secretary of address you regarding the incidence of incurred by the Government of India, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in of the case of the Muscat dhow Khadra which was seized by the Italian authorities towards the close of 1908, at Hafun in Italian Somali land, on the plea that she was engaged in the arms traffic. It was convenient that the sunfs payable should be disbursed with as little delay as possible, by the Government of India, in the first instance, but, as Secretary Sir E. Grey is aware, the right has throughout been reserved by this Department of claiming * Vide India February 1911. Office letter of 18th a moiety from British revenues, s:i and it appears to the Marquess of Crewe, on a review of the circumstances, that this is the only equitable course. It has been recognised that the action of the Italian naval authorities in seizing the dhow merely because a single rifle was found concealed on board was high handed and unjustifiable ; the action took place in a port far removed from the sphere of Indian interests, and it was to be expected that in such a case the Italian Government might be induced, by representations through the diplomatic channel, to give reparation in full for the treatment to which the dhow was subjected. Moreover, the maintenance of cordial relations with the Sultan of Muscat was a matter at least as much of British as of Indian concern, in view of the wish of the British Government to co-operate with the Italians in the suppression of the arms traffic in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. I am, therefore, to express the hope that Sir E. Grey will represent the case strongly to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury with a view to their acceptance of a moiety of the expenditure as a charge upon British revenues. The total of this expenditure is 312b U. 4L, as shown in the enclosed statement. It is possible, however, as explained in the enclosed correspondence,! that t Correspondence received in letters from the Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India, No. 31 M, dated 27th July 1911, and No. 33 M, dated 10th August 1911.

Grey to state, for the information of the Marquess of Crewe, that he has laid the matter before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury. In reply their Lordships state that they have given their careful consideration to the proposal of the Secretary of State for India that half the expenses incurred, viz., one hundred ^md fifty-six pounds and eightpence, should be borne by the British Exchequer, but that, after a review of all the circumstances, and having regard to the close political and commercial relations between India and Muscat, their Lordships have come to the conclusion that the charge is not one which can properly be admitted by this country.

In reply I am to inform you that, in view of the circumstances that Indian revenues at present bear the whole diplomatic and consular charges in connection with Muscat, and that the expenditure now in question is relatively of small amount, the Secretary of State in Council will not further press his view as to the apportionment of the charges. He desires, however, to make it clear that his action is taken without prejudice in any way to his right to raise at some future time the question whether the general charges at Muscat should not be borne equally between British and Indian revenues, as is the case with similar expenditure in Persia and Koweit, and with certain charges connected with Bahrein.

There is some doubt as to the intention of His Majesty’s Government in the matter of the ultimate incidence of the British share (2,500 dollars) of the compensation of 5,000 dollars, and of the item of Rs. 1,500 (£ 100 ) on account of travelling expenses, to he paid to the Nakhoda of the dhow. In reply to Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 27th December 1910, the Govern- ment of India expressed* their readiness * Fwe telegram, dated the 12 th January 1911 . , iipji * - p j- to pay halt the amount ot compensation. In the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office, dated the 9th December 1910, it was stated that Your Lordship “would be prepared to accept the compromise detailed in the telegram to the Government of India of 6 th October, and their reply of 5th December, by which a sum of Rs. 1,500 (£100) would be defrayed in the first place out of Indian revenues, subject to eventual adjustment between the British and Indian Governments In the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office, dated the 17th January 1911, it was stated that “ the travelling expenses Rs. 1,500 (£100) must apparently be paid by the Government of India alone * * ”, and, in Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 17th February 1911, the Government of India were authorised to pay, at their discretion, up to the above amount on account of the same. Finally, in the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office, dated the 18th February 1911, Your Lord- ship reserved “ the right to make a claim upon the British Exchequer for a moiety of the amount to be disbursed by the Government of India in connection with the settlement of this case ”. 3. Arrangements have been made to meet the charge of the 2,500 dollars, as also the charge for travelling expenses, not exceeding Rs. 1,500, from Indian revenues in the first instance, but we shall be glad to be informed whether these amounts are to be borne wholly by the Government of India, or whether they2 will be divisible between tbe Home and Indian Governments. We hold strongly that both items should be shared by the Imperial Exchequer, since Imperial as well as Indian interests were involved.

Although Kis Majesty’s Government consider that the Nakhoda is entitled to Five thousand dollars as compensation, it is possible that the Italian Government may refuse to pay | so large a sum and should this prove the case, I request you to ascertain at your discretion what sum they would be will ing to give the Kakhoda and report the matter by telegraph.

It is to be hoped, however, that the Italian Government will not be slow to realise that such an incident could hardly have taken place at a more completely inopportune time than the present, they having only just sent an Agent to Maskat who is entirely dependent on our countenance and good offices for a friendly reception, or even toleration by His Highness the Sultan.

The dhow had its regular paper?, and was authorised by the Sultan of Maskat to carry five (5) rifles and 500 cartridges for the protection of his boat. When the dhow arrived to Hafun the Italian Lieutenant,. M, Fiore, Com mander of His Majesty’s dhow, went on board of Ahzdra for the regular search. But he did not find neither the rifles nor the cartridges. After many investiga* lions he found hid under a carpet one rifle just when the Nakhoda assured that no rifle at all was Id his boat. Besides the rifle so found had not on its stock the marks required by the Act of Bruxelles, Article IX; paragraph 5.3 For these reasons, the Lieutenant seized the dhow, and sent to this Con sulate his report. I wrote to the Minister o{ Foreign Affairs, in Rome, explaining the case and suggesting to give orders to deliver immediately the dhow Kcdra.

In order that His Highness might be in possession of all information UvVajlable before proceeding, I despatched the telegram of which a copy is en closed, to the Resident at Aden. On receipt of his reply I will again address you. 4. At the request of M. Umberto Omar, Italian Agent here, I am providing him with a copy of the Nakhoda's statement. I also arranged that M. Omar should have an opportunity of personnally questioning the Nakhoda about the matter. of statement made on the \2lh day of March 19.09, by Mubaralc bin Khamis el Alawi el'Wnlad, Nakhoda of the dhow ‘ ‘ El Khadra before R.

We sold all our dates there, except a few which we kept for eating. We took 500 bags of chunam. I had taken G boxes of dry grapes from Sun I had $1,000 the payment for carriage of the dates and* $300 as present.

The rate agreed on was $6 for a man and $8 for a woman. A deposit of $2 was taken from each. I left Mokalla on 17th Elkadr. I reached Hafun on Elkadr 25th. Then a badcn came with Italian people in it. Then one I tali, n man and one tofangchi with him came into my boat. Immediately he arrived in the boat, he went and took the flag and tore it. The flag was the Sultan's flag. It was flown at the stern. They 0 took the buggalow to the bunder. Then a boat containing four soldiers came from a big buggalow belonging to the Italians. Then all the passengers were kept ashore. Then the Italian man examined the buggalow. When I left Mf skat I had five rifles and I had a written permission from the Sultan to carry them. When I was at Sur I ordered all the five rifles to be landed and four were landed, but one of the crew kept one rifle unknown to me. There were no cartridges kept with it. The Italian man searched the huggalow for rifles. He found the one rifle. The rifle was on deck underneath bedding, I said I had got a pass from the Sultan of M skatfor the rifle and also a letter from the British Consul. The Italian man then took me and the rifle and the papers all ashore. Then an Italian officer on shore asked me who had written the papers. I said the Sultan of Maskat and the British Political Agent, M skat. The Italian officer asked if I had given some present to the British Political Agent for this writing. I said no. The Somalis there came and asked the Italian officer to let me go with my buggalow. The Italian officer next day sent the passengers—174 in all—to Mombassa in another boat. I did not take passage money from them. I kept the $2 from each passenger. It was only $300. There were 32 women and 142 men. The total passage money from them would have been $1,108. I therfore lost 808 dollars. After 12 days the Italians sent the crew of the buggalow with their belongings to Sawahil, The crew were 22. I had given them $1,800 as advance for the journey. They were to trade with it for themselves. I asked the Italian not to send them away because they had had this money from me. I alone remained in Hafun one month and 18 days. Every day the Italian said an officer would come and give orders, but it did not come. I paid $130 for a boat to Mokalla. The Somali Sultan helped. The Italian officer gave me a receipt for the $1,000 taken from buggalow. There were also mats and carpets and other things in the buggalow. The passengers stole from my wife $180 gold ornaments. I hid them in a package when the Italians came, because I thought they would steal them. The passengers stole them. From Mokalla I took a small boat to Merbat and from Merbat came to Sur. From Sur I came here with letters from Jaalan and Sur to the Sultan and to the British Consul. I left Hafun to go to Mokalla on 8 th Muharram. I have heard that the Italians have given the buggalow back. Now I have got no crew and nothing at all. The buggalow was properly sealed when I left. I claim compensation as follows :— (1) $1,000. The Italians counted this; it is in the bag. They took it when I first came to Hafun. The Italians have it now. (2) Goods in the buggalow— (a) Six cases dried grapes $48.. (b) 500 bags of chunam $1,550. I bought this at Mokalla and paid $100 per 100 bags. I also paid $50 as duty at Mokalla for export on each 100 bags, in all $250. The empty bags cost $14 a hundred, in all $70 for 500. The cooly was $11 for 100 bags, $55. The freight for each 100 bags from Mokalla to Swahli was $37. I should have sold each bag at Swahli for Rs. 5, so that I should have got Rs. 2,500. I have, however, only put my loss at $1,550. (c) 35 bundles of dates $290. I got these dates from Basreh and Barni. These were for eating for the crew and a few for presents (d) 14 bags of rice $168. These we bought at Mokalla. Between Mokalla and Hafun we ate 3 bags of rice out of 17 and had 14 left. * (e) Dried fish to amount of $70. I took this from Merbat. Some of this was for eating and some was for profit. (/) Amber $300. This I got from Sur. The total of these items is $2,426. ( 3 ) $808, the balance of the passage money which I should have received from passengers to Mombassa. ( 4 ) $1,800. I gave this sum as advance to the crew. I gave it them as advance for the last voyage but one. For this voyage I gave adva nee of $1,100. The rule is that these advances are given each voyage and are not repaid unless the men wish to leave the boat and go to some other Nakhoda. Then they have to pay half the money given. Now my crew have gone and I have lost all the advances. The total is $2,900.5 (5) 8 bundles of canvas, value $80. Part was for the sail and patr for trade. ( 6 ) Personal effects, carpets, clothes, cooking pots, $“ 00 . (7) Value of my wife's gold ornaments stolen $180. ( 8 ) Loss on trade which I should have done by purchasing cows, ghee and salt at Hafun for Sawahil and the Gulf of Zanzibar and by taking passengers $ 2 , 000 . I get this profit every year. (9) Paid for Badan from Hafun to Mokalla $130. (10) $3,500 loss on passage money, freight and trading on cargo which I should have brought from African coast to Mokalla, Sur and the Persian Gulf. The goods are copra, semsem and timber. Also passengers. The total is $13,524. 1 do not know how to get my buggalow back here. It would cost $2,000 or $3 000 I should have to collect a new crew here and take them there. Now is not the time for sailing to Hafun, the wind and sea is against it. Only a steamer could go. If I get the $13,524 I will myself bear the loss of collecting a new crew and going to Hafun to take away the buggalow. If I get the $13,524 then the things mentioned in the list as being in the buggalow shall be for the Italians. Only the buggalow I want. The value of that is $6,000. If the buggalow is handed back to me with all its contents in good condition, namely as follows :— $ Cash Dried grapes Chunam (cost price and freight) Dates Rice Fish Amber Canvas Personal effects Total .. 3,516 Then I will reduce my claim to $10,008. I came to Mokalla in a little boat as I said. My nephew brought me from Mokalla to Sur, seeing that I had become poor. As I paid nothing for this, I have not made any claim for this for compensation.

Sir E. Grey accordingly desires me to suggest, for the consideration of Viscount Morley, that if an answer 1 ' rQ Under Secretary of State India Office.answer is not very shortly received from the Govern ment of India to the telegram addressed to them on the 5th instant, a fresh telegram he sent asking for an early reply.

Your telegram of 26th ultimo Sultan has been sounded by [? Holland], He said that personally he would ever agree to anything short of satisfaction, and that if Sur people did not get justice they would not forget, and would some day hake revenge Holland reports that Sultan’s failure to secure redress has already weakened dhow and'clm S t' r: ^r ed whether S, ', r peo P le would be disposed to take (Wn conteuts including money on board, Sultan replied that if British not inv u order f d . the y matter is in British hands, but he would Assn , Yn,l 7 T | l , 111 W , lthou ‘ a subsid .r nakhoda could not start for ssab, and U will soon be too late for him to fetch dhow before beginning of monsoon. Sultan regards whole question from point of view of equity respectively of the legal technicalities. He undoubtedly feels very acutely m regard to this case and would resent being compelled to endorse, under pressure from us, a solution which he considers harsh and humiliating, even more than he would resent adverse decision by Prize Court. in all the circumstances, I think it would be preferable to adopt alternative re erred to m your telegram of 17th ultimo, informing Italian Government of sultans point of view, and perhaps adding some friendly expression depre- cating Italian action, such as would leave us free to dissociate ourselves specifically from it, should this subsequently seem expedient for the pro tection or our own interests at Maskat. At present juncture, when at any moment we may require to negotiate with Sultan concerning arms traffic ques ion, it is most undesirable to arouse his resentment over minor question i ve pi ('sent one. Possibly this consideration might carry some weight with Italian Government if explained to them. M.^i (31920/10). FOREIGN OFFICE, September /U 1910. lo Sir:- 15 SEP1910 Vh. ppr 1 y' 0 ! with reference to your letter of April 12th last respecting the seizure hy the Italian Authorities at Fa.fun of the Muscat dhow 'El Khadra', I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before Viscount Lorley of Blackburn, a pla IS copy of a despatch from His Lajesty's Ambassador at Rome enclosing the reply of the Italian Government to the representations made to them by His Excel lency on the subject. Ihe Italian Government are prepared, if the le gality of the measures taken by the authorities at Kafun is recognized by the parties interested, to re lease the dhow and to restore the property found in it to the rightful owners, deducting from the money in the chest the sum expended on the repatriation of the Nakhoda and crew^_ They are not, however, pre- iw - -ke Under Secretary of S India Office. 15SEP 1210 pared(31920/10). prepared to pay any compensation unless His Majesty's Government will consent to tear half the cost, on the grounds that His Majesty's Government have an equal interest in the removal of a feeling of discontent in the minds of the Sultan of Muscat and his subjects, a discontent which would be caused in consequence of the enforcement of the measures agreed upon by Great Britain and Italy in 1904. The Italian Government maintain that their action with regard to the seizure of the dhow was based upon Article 5 of those in structions which prescribes the capture of vessels 'when, being boarded and searched they attempt to resist, or if they refuse to produce their papers or in any other way attempt to hinder the Naval Autho rities in the performance of their duties”. I am, however, to observe that, so far as His Majesty's Government are aware, no attempt at resist ance was made by the Makhoda or crew of the dhow, and that the only irregularity which occurred was that on board was hidden, and that the per mit the one rifle(31920/10). permit to carry five rifles was only produced when the hidden rifle had been discovered. Moreover it would appear to Sir E. Grey that if, as the Italian Government maintain was the case, the seizure were made under the instructions of 1904 the / ( IS*- l' v&gt; dhow should, in accordance with Article 12 of those instructions, have been taken to Berbera and deliver ed to the first British, warship. Furthermore it is to be observed that the Italian Government in their r (y | ^ note of July 11th, 1909, which formed a sub-enclosure in my letter of August 3rd of that year, themselves maintained that the action taken by their Officers at Hafun was based on the authority derived from the right of high territorial sovereignty exercised inde pendently of international obligations, the dhow at the time of the seizure actually being anchored on Italian soil. Sir E* drey is of opinion that the Italian Gov ernment can hardly claim that His Majesty's dovern- ment should share in the costs of compensation for an9.1 and uha ro^-lac^lons v&lt;'hioh .rora orat on tha oorrootnaaa of tha ir i*o oadura • Thay ara hovwar still . ra arad to a’a’da by th« attituda thay had at first ado-tad and with this objeot hava auaparUsd tho a xs out Ion of tha ao.otsnos of tha Comt ifhioh has now tw m given f provided that recognition can bo obtained from the pa**- tio^ interested of the legality of the measures takon # without r/hioh they loaintain that doubts might oo oroated as to whether ain-iole 5 of the instructions agreed upon by Oreat Britain anl Italy in an exchange of notes dated the 18th of April aryl 85th f t 1904 of jay res ective y van not ignored by the lowers &lt;/h 1 eh hatl drawn up t*hese instinjctions.

His Britannic Majesty’s Government cease in this note to contest the legality of the sequestration effected by the Ita lian Authorities at Hafun and lay^ stress on the motives of equity and the political consequences which should move the Italian Government to accept a lenient solution of the ques tion anc wa/ve the strict application of the international ar rangements in force. With regard to this point, I think it desirable to recall that ajest'. * s Government diet net fail fre - the very e- ginning of the question, to bear in mind the political exigen cies emphasised in the Embassy’s note and in consideration thereof to conduct their procet s in trie manner most favour- able to the Sultan of Muakat and towards the naflUda and owner It will be wall to recall the following facts. 1. Immediately after the sequestration of the ahow, and indeed before the Authorities and the Government of His Bri tannic Majesty interested themseves in the question of the 'Khacira**, JKis A tiaj esty’a Government, though dndaubtedly in a position to obtain in the Courts a confirmation of the seques tration, gave instructions to the Consulate at Aden to consent to the liberation of the chow, on condition that, in the at ^=* sonce of a judicial sanction of the seizure, the Sultan of of the 'Khadra' Huskat Sir Fennell Rodd H.B.K. Ambassador.Muskat and the nakhoda should recognise the legality of the measures taken by the Italian Authorities at Hafun. ^The commander of the Italian armed dhows had on his part before receiving the above-mentioned instructions, placed the nakhoda of the •Khadra M in provisional liberty; the latter had pressed for it, offending spontaneously as £4 guarantee for his return to make u declaration by which ho renounced all rirht to the dhow in the event of his not reappearing before the Italian Authorities. 3. As this has proved to be the case, Kie Majesty^ Government might have withdrawn the favourable instructions already given; they chose however, with a constant regard for the political coneiderations which are now brought forward by the Embassy, and in a spirit of friendliness towards the Sul tan of Vuckat, to renounce the right which the nakhoda himself recognised was theirs and still to keep Open the favourable offer they had made. 4. The failure to arrive at this solution was solely due to the fact that the parties interested, for reasons which have not been brought to the knowledge of this Ministry, did not feel that they ought to accept it, although the )ritish Authorities at Aden themselves recognised the desirability. Jfeverihele«a the Italian Government with generous intentions again declared -1 u dq!-^ ready to accept this solution in conse quence of the interest shewn by His Britannic Majesty 1 © Oo- ' vernaent. It is evident, after these repeated proofs of the friend* JShU* AA\. ly attitude of Hic^’-ajosty * © Government, uhat, if their favour able proposal© had been accepted, they would have abstained from handling the question on the baois of strict legality, to which they have been forced both by the unconclliatory atti tude of the partiee concerned and by the reflections cast onth0 le - alit y the sequeetration by the British Government thenaelveB. ^ or reas0 ^ 'Khaora 11 wsxa t pending th« negotia tions^ taken to A*«*b where the trial took place reaultinf: in a sentence which validated the sequestration. xhe execution of the sentence flat* been suspended until the conclusion of the present negotiations* If| lfum » the points are dropped and it Is asked tnat regard nay be especially h&amp;c to considerations of policy JtoUttasyt. anc equity, HisJTajesty's Government would have no difficulty in maintaining the attitude they adopted from the first; they must however observe that they can accept this point of view only provided that the solution to bo arrived at should not be of a nature to Infringe the international dispositions go verning the application of the General Act of the Conference of Brussels. Among these disjiosit-ona, article 5 of the instructions ■sed upon I Britain and Italy by the exchange of note! K of the 1.2th ox April - 25th of May 1S04 categorically prea- cribea the capture of Teasela»whon, being boarded ana aearchecj, * they attempt to resist or if they refuse to produce their papers or in any other way attempt to hinder the naval Author!- tlet; in the per for ’.once of their duties*. iO-. Go vernment can confidently affirm that their Authorities, on the occasion of the capture of the 'Khadra' aid no more than apply the above-mentioned article 0, together with the other measures applicable to the situation created by the surrender cf “ hs wca P on “nd the irregolarity of the licence; the Italian 'icvermnent therefore declare that, as the basis of any aettle- ment, they must insist on the recognition by the parties Into- roeted of the legality of the measures taken against the 'Bha- dra?,seeing that a settlement which, 'asides sstting aside the ordinary Judicial procedure, ms not based on such a recog- nit ionuS^%jL /%a/1 nition^ Might give rise to the doubt *n* the article 5 wae^ red by the very Powefe which had agreed upon it. ms*/ Xt •' tti6 r#CO « nltlon obtained, Hi^ilaJe B ty• e Sovernaent will suspend the execution of the sentence which has already be„n pronounced ordering the definite confiscation of the ■Khadra-, and Wl11 bo rea '^ tc consent to the release of the dhov as a friendly concession to the Sultan of kusicat whose influence in the question of the contraband arms traffic is fully recognised.

It was in this rplrit that His 'Jujesty^s Government offered to try to Inauce f?iB Highness to acknowledge the technical legality of the action of the local Italian authorities, pro viced that the Italian Government wore wiiimr to grunt some compensation to the Pultun me the ovsner of t-hti dhow. Buch compensation, they thought, mlrht b-s P r-alu on the pro tine of equity alone, anc irrespeetiva of the result of any judicial enquiry ue to the technl- cul I«c*l~wy of thf iure. fils Majesty^ Government considered that i;ven if the technical legality of the seizure were admitted in any case the penalty exacted, namely the confiscation of the dhow aiui its cargo, was vax j of all proportion to any offence that had been com- mitteo, one they put forwaro their surr^stion v^s a pos sible \(U53L/10). poeoible solution which would moat the csoiro of the Itall/ji local authcrltlee for lofal function of their action sold at the eaie tine eatiefy the r^terial in ane the Nakhoou.

Holland, Esq., Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Under instructions received by telegram from the Political Resident just before the departure of the mail, I have the honour to submit herewith a copy of a letter which I have addressed to the Resident on the subject of the dhow M Kadra J No. 168, dated the 27th March 1910 (Confidential). From— R E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul Maskat, J * To Colonbl P Z Cox C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident and His Britannic Majesty s Consul-General, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with mv telegram dated 20th March 1910, on the subject of the seizure of the dhow “ kadra’’ bv the Italian authorities at Hafun. J 2 . In the rejoinder of the Italian Government, dated 31st January 1910, it is again maintained that the story as to the destruction of the Oman flag is false, and it is alleged that the owner of the dhow, in a statement before me on 7th March 1909, made no mention of any insult to the flag. In this connection Copy forwarded with my letter No. 287 , dated the Iwould respectfullv invite attention to isth March 1909. the Nakoda’s statement? recorded by me on 12th March 1909, in which he distinctly stated that the flag had been torn. It seems superfluous to lay further stress on the fact that numerous Oman Nakodas complained of the destruction of their flags by the Italian officers and that such complaints were received from various sources by the Sultan, the Consul-General at Zanzibar as well as by myself. A list of the names of the Nakodas, who complained of seizure of their flags was forwarded to vou with my letter No. 339, dated 2nd April 1909. ^ J 3. Secondly, the Italian Government, assuming for the sake of argu ment, that only one unmarked rifle was carried wrongfully in the dhow, justify the severity of the penalty threatened in this case on the ground that it will tend to check the nefarious introduction of small lots of rifles under cover of the Sultan’s permits. With regard to this I would respectfullv submit that the desired result could be brought about far more simply and satisfactorily by arranging with the Sultan for the institution of a marking system, so as to ensure the identification of the rifles for which permits are given. The Sultan would certainly agree to this, if he were approached in a friendly manner. 4. Thirdly, the Italian Government argue that it would be in manifest contradiction that His Majesty’s Government, after declaring their readiness te endeavour to obtain recognition of the legality of the proceedings, should raise the question of compensation. His Majesty’s Government in paragraph 5 of their Memorandum, dated 2nd November 1909, noted that the action of the Italian authorities was said to have been taken on authority derived from the right of high territorial sovereignty exercised independently of international obligations, the dhow having been anchored upon Italian soil. His Majesty’s Government, however, earnestly represented that, even if this argument was admitted, the seizure of the dhow and its cargo was, from any equitable point of view, a penalty out of all proportion to whatever offence had been committed. It is plain that His Majesty’s Government considered compensation to be claimable on the ground of equity alone, and irrespective of the result of any judicial enquiry as to the technical legality of the seizure. This is, of course the opinion of His Highness the Sultan who is ignorant of the principles of international law and of the abstract rights of territorial sovereignty, but has a keen perception of equity and fair dealing. To the uninformed Arab the seizure of a dhow in such circumstances, involving the ruin of the owner, K&lt; ► Jappears to be an act of flagrant and cruel injustice, and he is unable to under stand why it should be perpetrated by a civilised State. 6. Pending the receipt of instructions, I have not sounded His Highness as to the proposed compromise, but I believe it would be very unpalatable to him and that he would refuse to accept it, unless urged to do so by us. I think that he would prefer to abandon the whole matter rather than to agree to the course suggested, further, I very much doubt whether the owner of the dhow could be induced to go and fetch his dhow under the condition offered. The Nakoda could not collect a crew and start for Aden without a subsidy, and even if the necessary arrangements for doing this could be made at once, he would probably not be able to refit the dhow, which must now be in a bad condition, and get back here before the ensuing monsoon. It was difficult enough to get him started for Aden last year on 21st April by mail steamer, and he has now no means of going by steamer, while the dhow is no longer at Aden but at Assab. Also the cargo is probably ruined. 6. Por the above reasons, I am respectfully of opinion &gt; that it would be better to await the result ef the judicial proceedings, rather than to attempt to bring about the compromise suggested. It seems hardly credible that an impartial tribunal could condemn the dhow and its contents for such slender cause, but even if condemnation were to be pronounced, the Nakoda would scarcely he worse off than he would be under the arrangement proposed, since it is not in his power to go to Assab to recover his dhow, without assistance. 7. The Sultan’s failure to secure redress has weakened his influence in Sur, and it is noteworthy that the Beni Bu Ali, to which tribe the owner of the dhow belongs, have just shown their contempt for His Highness’s authority by seizing with bloodshed a fort belonging to their rivals, the Beni Bu Hasan.Foreign Off toe. 6 ^ Sir, With reference to yotir letter No* 8? 76 of 14 th Far oh 1910, respecting the seizure of the Muscat dhow 'Kadra' at Has Hafim, I am directed to enclose for the information of the S. of S. for F. A. copy of furtl'ier telegrams which have he'n exchanged with the 0. of T. on the subject. discount Morley is disposed to concur in the opinion expressed by them in +he telegram of 8th instant, and would suggest , for Sir F. Grey's consideration, that the Sultan of Mus cat's attitude should now be explained to the Italian Govt,, and that they should be informed that H. M. Govt, have received their reply with great disappointment. It had been hoped that having regard to the importance of the question of the arms traffic to the interests of both countries, the Ital ian Govt, roould have looked at the broad issue 9 involved rather than at legal technicalities; and they were prepared, if the Italian Govt, had shown any disposition to meet them in the matter, to use thei^ goof, offices with the Suitor, of Muscat in order to bring him to a reasonable frame of mind and to ensure that incidents of the hind should not recur. But the Italian Govt, prefer to press to its extreme conclusion\ N conclusion a cave which canno* from the point of view of equity he regarded as a strong one. The ’result must he to h-ring upon them - and to some extent upon this country - the ill-will of the Sultan, who hasfit in his power to cause both parties a good deal of inconvenience, and who - if his subjects attempt reprisals - will now have no inducement to restrain them. In these oirwm- \ stances, if the Italian aovt. persist in their line of action, H. H. Govt, have no alternative but +o dissociate themselves from it anfi from its conse quences. Lord Horley would leave it to Sir E. Grey to consider whether a representation +o this effect should be made to thdftalian Govt.

'with regard to the story of the “Kh&amp;dra’e flag (from which perhaps the story reported and magnified at Zan- sibar), I quote here the actual words pronounced by the owner of the dhow, after his flight from Hafun and arrival at Muscat, in his deposision before the British local agent (arch 7 1909); r I arrived at Hafun on the 26th el G'heda*, at Hafun itself we met with opposition from the Italians as we had harcly ar rived when a launch with two a&amp;carlb came to us and accompa nied us into the port where four other aacario then came cn board, who lowered our flay without interrogating us and re mained on board all night, and in the morning the dhow was searched( 3 &gt; searched.’ A- is fteftn, the nakhoda himself speaks only of the low ering of the flas and of nothin# s^ore, and It was at 6 p.m., the moment at which all/flags are lowered. Moreover in the whole deposition no allusion is made to the fla#. u The declarations contained in the memorandum of torember lf » support ed by the dfisposiUcna of local witne^tes transmit ted in the note of November 27 last, explain the absence on board the 'Khadra' of the other four rifles which should have bQi»n tnere and which it turns out were disembarked at Sur. But this circumstance was neither kno.n when the act of seques tration trek place nor wab indicated by the nakhoda, who raore- u/y+*.Ll LmaJC ^vsr^had every interest in doing so; and since in the proceed ings with regard to the w Khadra M it was only possible to take irlo account facts known or ^resumed at the tine, it does not appear that the new circumstance can avail tc annul the mea sures already taken, upon which, especially now the trial is in process, the «a#istrate alone is called upon to decide. Since t ien the alleged circuustonce/ of the landing of he four rifles at Sur could only be weighed by a proper court law wiere it might tell in favour of the nakhoda, it appears that rather than * eing a reason for removing the matter from judicial procedure it is an additional argument for sunmitting it to such procociure, oven in the interest of the accused kor can the small number of arms which the •Khadra' was carrying or should have had on board remove the suspicion of contraband. Too great dangers and toe many personal and finan cial risks are offered by the carrying on of contraband on a large scale; so that it seems &amp; more likely hypothesis that &amp; nakhoda should prefer instead to engage in the transport of Roods and passengers, increasing the profits of each voyage by a continual but unobserved introduction of arms in small lots an&lt; * *ore easily when the possession of a permit, gi ven by the proper Authorities}, to car-y a certain number ofarms senerally without any mark enables him to renew each voy age his ouppijE of arsa, onourlng at the carte time almost com- pl^to inunity. Contraband, however email its extent, when carried on in sso biaguiaed a form and almost under an appearance of legality, mat rather be held to be the more dangerous ano must b® pu- ni a-Med with not la^a Loverity if it is not desired that the attraction of the profits to be made and the safety from dis covery should lead to this convenient and insidious system of :e introduction of arms in very small quantities becoming &amp; Central practise among all the dhows that touch on the coast of ' orthern Somali lane. It is true that the Sultan of Muscat is not a signatory of the General Act of Brussels but on the oth r hand it is a lact '-hat oy article 1c of the instructions agreed upon Norths exchange of notes be ?»eeri Italy and Great Fritain of April 12 - a. 2b 190** the British Government has recognised the right of It' Ljan ships of war tc seize dhows of the Sultanate of Muscat&gt; and the Sultan of Muscat has himself accorded the right to seize dhows carrying his flag in the waters of the Sultanate when on t:eir way to Somaliland. Moreover the seizure of the 'Khadra' was not based on «*n international arrangement but, n.b is admiltea by the British government, ♦as carried out in the exercise of he ri ghts of high territorial sovereignty which belong to Italy, indepen* dently of ay international agreement, in the port of Kafun where the 'Khadra** was anchored. The British memorandum complains in this ca-:© of the excessive penalty which it holds to have been inflicted upon uhe naichoda in the seizure of the ohow. ihe ].ritieh Government would appear to consider the sei- aure as a definite confiscation from the moment when they a ribute to it the character of a punishment. The seizure le 1 : 1 ‘ i -1b however not a punibhment because punishment in a similar cab'.? is only thin the comp* tence of the juc/icial authority. It. 1 p ?wet a uea.na - in fact the only means-by which, when a case or suspected C£a.e of contraband is discoverer , the Authorities can detain the culprits ana the inetrumente of the offence on behalf of there judicial Authorities to whom it appertains to estimate, with the greatest competence unci with the greatest guarantees for the accused part, , the considera tions to ling for or against him and to decide as to the pu nishment or the release. His Britannic ’a Ooverr »nt consider likevriee to be unjustly onerous the condition accepted by tha nakhoda as to the lapsing of all right to the dhow in the case of his not a^ain presenting himaelf before the Ita lian Authorities. But the condition wu.&gt; offered spontaneously by the nakhoda, vho, it appears, wished himself to offer this exceptional guarantee in order thoroughly to convince our Authorities that ha would return, whereas he was evidently acting in bad faith towards them, hoping that by raising an international question he would escape the judgment against himself personally and the consequences of his on spontaneous declaration. Kor can the pledges which the Italian Consul rt Aden may hiiv*:? given to the British Authorities at Aden for the release of the chow, when it still seemed possible to corne to a friend ly understanding with the nakhoda, suffice to cut short the regular course of the procedure before the juaici&amp;l Authori ty O^trur that the matter has come up for judgment. On the con trary the Boyal Government cannot but feel surprised at the fact that a different solution should be expected or demanded from that inpesod by the rules of co ion law anc by the very terms of the General Act of Brussels if these be re *urdec a applicable to the case. i From the political point of view the memorandum pointsout the nece^bity for a bpirit of moderation on the part of the naval Aut -oritiea in the exercise of their bo &amp;&amp; not to injure the interests of coiacierce in general, and in parti cular t&gt;o as not to impair the friendly feelings towards us of the Sultan of Muscat whose influence and: goodwill can he of great use in bringing about the supprebsicn of the traffic in arm son t he Comali c oa u1. But in order to show the breadth of view and the tact with which our officers exercise their supervision, it is sufficient to place on record that during the whole of lu^t y ur (apart from the seizure of the mullah's dhow) one dhow only, the ■Khadra” and one M beden', the •Tarix', were removed from the regular course of their business for police reasons on the coaet of Northern BomaliiunA, a really insignificant num er if it is taicen into xpd-fe-i four months only and within without any inconvenience. We are moreover fully aware of the common interest of ^and ana Italy in retaining the friendship of the Sultan of Muscat; and it is just on account of this consideration tha: the Royal Government, as was communicated to the Iritish Br.i- ba-sy in the not© of July 11 last, consented, no tv/i thstancing their convict on of their perfect right and the declaration abandoning the dhow mad© by the owner, to prcpcea^n arrangement in th© sens© of the restitution of the M I.ri&amp;dra” on ccridx^ion that the Sultan of Muscat and the nahiioaa acknowledged the seixura to b© quite la^^^T^ana renounced all claim or pretention of any kind in consaquance i/'iereof. 1 hia compromise was not arrived at in spile of our goodwill. The Royal Government now tak^ note with satisfaction of the declaration made by His hajesty'a Government that .*©^ are ready to take action with a view to tn# adoption a system cf narking arms and to exercise their influence in this parti cular case to obtain f“om the Sultan and tfro nakhoca a r^co - the waters of Fafun ulon© more than 126 dhows were searched n i t i o nnition of the legality of V H* measure© taken by the Italian Authoritie* in regard to the fihow. Inasmuch as ©uch a recog nition co^reapcndB entirely to the condition stipulated by ua laat July for an understanding and it is further desired to furnish yet another proof of the friendly spirit felt by Italy for the Sultan of Muscat, the Pcyal Govern ont f being unable to auapend the course of justice, again declare t.emaelves pre pared, as an exceptional ^neaeure, to suspend the execution of ffU &lt;run*JLA* the sentence, provided that the Sultan himae ^an d t he n akh o da of the dhoe accept at once the procedure proposed last July, ai ning the required declaration in conclusion of that agree ment . With regard to the ciemanu for compensation for the Sultan and for the no&amp;hoda for the expenses incurred, the British Government must now recognise that it appeal® to be in open contradiction with the declaration mace by them that they are prepared to take action with a view to obtaining a recognition of the legality of ail that had occurred. And indeed, admitting, as is implicitly admitted by tne British Government, that the Italian Authorities have acted fully within their rirhtu, it is difficult to uncerstand what ^r * round there cun be for m-h r^.ir-tn.rh pensation. We are confident tha^ with the influence which the Bri tish Government have declared themselves disposed to exercise, the Sultan of Muscat and the nakhoda will be ready to accept the solution which in a road-minded and benevolent spirit has been prop- aed by the Royal Government in friendly defe ence to the views of the British Government. Should the required declarations not be forthcoming, the Poyal Goveirnment will fine themselves constrained to carry out in full the sentences which may be pronounced by the judicial Authority as the outcome of the prcceodinga already initiated.mNFIDm iAL.

BRITISH AGENCY AND CONSULATE, Muscat, 27th September 1909. slr , rOu'tH) In continuation of my telegram No. 1032, dated the 27th September 1909, on the subject of the seizure of Muscat dhows by the Italian authorities at Hafun, I hare the honour to forward herewith copies of the letter and su:.imonses which Monsieur Omar transmitted to the Sultan through me and of the Sultans reply to Monsieur Omar. 2. M. Omar proposed at first, to communicate direct with the Sultan on the subject, but after discussion with me decided to s act through my agency. I advised His Highness to reply in the terms already reported so that the Italian Government could have no ground for alleging that the Sultan had treated them with discourtesy, and also because it seemed a suitable opportunity for him to intimate to the Italian Government that the British Government are acting on his behalf in ohis master.3. The ITajchodas of the two dhows would of course never have consented to attend the Court and indeed had they been willing to do so the proximity of the date fixed for the trial would h rendered it very difficult for them to reach Assab in time. Further, if the Sultan had attested to serve the summonses on k® trial would have suinmonses on the two Naihodas it would have aggravated the situation at Sur. 4. The Italian Government were clearly inclined, when the capture of the 'Kadra' was first reported, to repudiate the action of their subordinate and to release the dhow without conditions. I am informed by U. Omar that while they were in this frame of mind, they recalled the overzealous officer and sent instructions that less stringent methods were to be employed future. Their subsequent change of front is perhaps due to the fact that they desire to avoid admitting publicly that the action of their subordinate was improper, but presumably they still recognise that the seizures, even if legally valid, were illadvised and entailed undeserved hardship on the owners and crews of the ships. If so, they might perhaps be willing to effect some compromise with the Sultan in order to close the incident. I would suggest for consideration that if His Majesty^ Government think proper, an arrangement should be proposed whereby the Italian Government should return the dhow and its contents and should give some compensation to the owner and the Sultan for expenses&lt;axparises incurrcsclj th.e Sultan on th.e other hand acknowledging tne technical legality of the seizures and undertaking to insti- tute a marking system for arras for which passes are granted in future. If this could he arranged, the sultan would doubtless be content without a formal assurance regarding the respect due to his flag. If howwver there is no likelihood of a compromise, I would enquire v/hetfcer it would be possible to get the whole matter referred to the Hague Tribunal. 5. It may be noted, with reference to paragraph 5 of my telegr No. 960, dated the 8th September 1909, that in the summons addressed to the Nakhoda Mubarak bin Kharais, by the Assab Tribunal, there is no mention of any breach of parole by him. 6. A copy of this letter has been forwarded direct to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla, in accordance with your general instructions. I have etc., (Sd). H. E. HOLLAND, Political Agent le H. B. M*s Consul,Translation of a lettar dated fr«m the Italian Agent, Muacat, to His Hiphness the Sultan of Muscat. After Compliments. I wanted to come to you with a view to inform you that the 'Takhodas TCUharak bin Khamis and Juma bin Hamid, residents of Sur, carried fire-arms to Assab without permission and that a Committee is to be held there on 11th Showal 1327 (27th October 1909) to enquire into the matter, but I did not venture to do so thinking that I may be giving trouble in calling upon you in the month of Ramzan. Now I have written letters to the said Nakhodas and have handed over to the Consul Mr. Holland with a request that the letters may be given to you. You will see these letters (notices) which I hope you will be good enough to serve upon the said TTakhodas and return them to me when served.

(39435) 1. First, as regards the treatment of the flag. The Nakhoda's statement of 12 th iiarc’n, 1909, para. 1. Makhoda affirmed before His Majesty’s Consul at Muscat that tne Italian official wno visited the dhow in Hafun Harbour at once took the flag and tore it, the flag being the Sul- Italian Mote, tan’s flag and flown at the stem. His Majesty’s G-ovemment take note of the statement of the Italian C-ovemment that page 1 . 'proper information having been laid before the Boyal Con sulate at Aden and before the Officer in command of the 'Squadron, the episode of the offence committed against the 'Muscat flag has proved to be absolutely non-existent'. They may, however, be permitted to observe that tne com plaint as regards the treatment Ox tne 'Kadra’s' tlag did not stand alone . Tne treatment of the flags of other dhows was tne subiect of comment in the Mote addressed to Count de Hosdari on the 19tn March last, and in point oi lact complaints as to the treatment oi Muscat flags were simul taneously made before His Britannic Majesty’s consuls no Zanzibar and Muscat, as well as to the bultan nimself . 2. In the Italian Government’s Note the comment is madeItalian Note, lage 2 . ff n Kakhoda’s statement of 12 March, 1909 para. 1 . Italian Note, page 2 . made that the British Government omitted in their Note to menw tion the fact that the Nakhoda was unable to account for the absence of the 4 other rifles specified in the licence is sued to him. As to this, His Majesty’s Government would observe that the Fakhoda explained to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Muscat that the four rifles in question had been landed at Sur before he proceeded to Hafun . They have fur- tner received telegraphic information that statements made to the Consul at Muscat by three respectable witnesses con clusively prove tnia assertion to be correct. j ) 3. The view which His Majesty’s Government would suggest to the Italian Government is that the discovery of the single rifle on board the dhow, so far from proving any intention to import rifles into the Italian Protectorate, affords evidence of a distinctly contrary character. For not only has the rifle in question been pronounced at Aden to be one _ which has seen hard wear for about 1 C years, and likely therefore to fetch a very low price, but it seems reasonable to suppose that any dhow really bent on the illicit importa tion of rifles would attempt to import more than one rifle, or even five rifles, on any single voyage. No evidence nas been nroduced to give colour to a suspicion tnat tne ivak- hoda’sNakhoaa’s daow was habitually eng^ed in the illicit traffic of arms in her voyages to the Italian Protectorate. 4. In their Note the Italian Government draw attention to the facL that his ha jest y' s Government have admitted, with regard to the Suit an of huscat, the application in Italian territorial waters of trie Instructions prepared for the guid ance oi havai Officers in 1904. His haiesty’s Government would point out that it was possible to ma^e those instruc tions applicable to native vessels of the Sultan of Muscat in virtue oi a notification issued by the bultan himself on the 17th October 1903, prohibiting Pnportation of arms into the Italian Protectorate and granting authority to Italian ships of war to search suspected Muscat vessels in territorial wat ers or on the high seas. But as observed in the British note of the 18tu June 1909, tne bultan v;as not a signatory of the Brussels Act and its provisions cannot, therefore, be regard ed as binding on aim. b. His Majesty's Government note, uowever, that the action of whica complaint is made is saia to have been taken , which would nave required the dhow to have been taken to Ber- bera and delivered to the first British warship) , but on x not under the Instructions above referred to (Article 12 of authority x Copy annexed.authority derived from the right of high territorial sover eignty exercised independently of international obligations, tiie dhow having actually been anchored upon Italian soil, bven bo, His L-aiesty’s G-ovemiiient would earnestly represent equitable point oi view a penalty out of all proportion to wuatever offence had been committed . 6 . His majesty’s Government note the statement that the~~ hakhoda failed to surrender himself to the Italian authorit ies after giving a written declaration by which he recog corne the absolute property of the Italian Government. The j Nakhoda’s i Statement of Kakhoda has. however, statea that he remained in Hafun for 12 March, 1909, the date on which x,he Acting Consul General for Italy wrote to the Italian lieutenant to release the dhow (see his let ter to the First Assistant to tne Political Resident at Aden, Ho.215, 14th February 1909) . Loreover, the Nakhoda’s conduct in quitting the Italian Protectorate after so con siderable a stay r if not legally defensible, would appear tnat trie seizure oi the dhow and its cargo was from any nised that, in the event of such failure, the dhow would be para. 3. 1 month and 18 aays after the boarding of his dhow (i.e. to 8 th February) . He, therefore, left Hafun five days after . at any rate to be open to some excuse. It seems to His Majesty^s Government that in any case the condition in the declarationdeclaration as to the forfeiture of the dhow was unduly onerous, and need hardly have been accepted by the hakhoda, if he rightly appreciated its significance, except under serious protest. 7 . In the preceding paragraph it has been stated that the Acting Consul General for Italy wrote to the jj'irst As sistant to the Political Resident at Aden that the dhow was to be released. Prom that and later letters, Nos.324 and 327 dated the 14th and 16th March, also referring to the de livery of the dhow, it was understood that the dhow would be surrendered without conditions (except that in the letter of the 14th March deduction was mentioned of the expense of sending the passengers to Zanzibar^ . It was, therefore, a matter of surprise to the British authorities to learn at a later stage that conditions oi an important nature were to be attached to the surrender of the dhow, and that exper.se had been incurred to no purpose in tae seeding of a crew to Auen to taKe delivery of tne daow, when nanaed over. 8 . Tne reference in the concluding paragraph o: tne Italian Note to tae recognition by the British local author ities of the propriety of tne Italian proceedings is not | fully understood by His Majesty’s Government. The Acting PoliticalPolitical Peal dent at Aden did indeed at one time suggest to the Political Agent at Muscat that the Pakhoda might be in duced to settle the matter as desired by the Italian Consul General, but the Acting Resident was not primarily respons ible for dealing with the case, and it is understood that the suggestion referred to was only made on the hypothesis that trie presentment of the case by the Italian Consul General would be accepted by the British authorities having cogiis- r ance of the facts . 9. His Majesty's Government have very carefully consid- ered the statements made in the Italian Government's Note, but looking at the matter from the broadest point 01 view, they have been unable to avoid the conclusion that in this particular instance there has been an misapprehension ox the business in which the boatmen were engaged, and that Mae en- forcement of measures whica might be necessary for the sup- pression ox the arms traffic w r as not iustilied in this case. The special need for prudence and caution in exercising the right of search in the case of vessels under a ioreign xlag was emphasised in Article 9 ox the Instructions laid down in 1904 for Naval Officers. Though those instructions may not havehave been applicable in the present case, the Italian Govern ment vrould have no doubt desired that the same spirit of moderation should have regulated the action of tne Rafiai authorities in dealing with the dhow in Hafun harbour as tnat prescribed lor haval Officers . 1C. his Majesty’s Government appreciate fully, however, the friendly spirit in which trie Italian Government's Note is written, and they are gratified to learn that the Italian Government recoppise, as they do themselves, the importance of the common interests of the two Governments in the sup pression of the traffic in ar is cn the coast of Gomaliland. far.Wyndham to [Italian ; .F.A. As observed in iir. tyndham’s Gote of the IQth June last tne U 8 June 1909 . Sultan of Muscat has it in his power to no small degree to further or impede their common policy, and the most recent information in the possession of His Majesty's Government shows that His Highness’s mind has been deeply stirred by the incident now complained of. He has also oeen urgently pressed by his subjects to defend their interests ana has only succeeded with difficulty in exercising on them a res- : I training influence . JI i 1 11. His Majesty's Government trust that in the event of any adverse decision being arrived at by the tribunal atAssab in the case of the 'Kadra”, the Italian Government will be pleased to issue orders to the local authorities to refrain from giving it effect, pending the result of nego tiations between the two Ooverncients . They would further earnestly ask that the dhow should be returned with its contents and that some compensation should he granted to the owner and the Sultan of iduscat for the expenses which have been incurred. They are willing moreover to use their influence with the .Sultan to induce him to acknowledge the technical legality of the seizure and to undertake to in stitute in the future a system of marking arms. 12. Such a settlement, if accepted by the Italian Gov ernment, would presumably also apply to another cihow, the 'Tarak”, as to the confiscation of which His Majesty's Gov ernment are at present without lull details.{12 ] In any tun.her communica tion on this subject, please quote The Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents ,1 r Ins compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop y of the under-mentioned paper.

Moreover, the Nakhoda's conduct in quitting the Italian Protectorate after so con- siderable a stay, if not legally defensible, would appear at any rate to be open to some excuse. It seems to His Majesty's Government that in any case the condition in the declarationdeclaration as to the forfeiture of the dhow was unduly onerous, and need hardly have been accepted by the Nakhoda, if he rightly appreciated its significance, except under serious protest . 7 . In the preceding paragraph it has been stated that the Acting Consul General for Italy wrote to the First As sistant to the Political Resident at Aden that the dhow was to be released. From that and later letters, Nos.324 and 327 dated the 14th and 16th March, also referring to the de livery of the dhow, it was understood that the dhow would be surrendered without conditions (except that in the letter of the 14th March deduction was mentioned of the expense of sending the passengers to Zanzibar). It was, therefore, a matter of surnrise to the British authorities to learn at a later stage that conditions of an important nature were to be attached to the surrender of the dhow, and that expense had been incurred to no purpose in the sending of a crew to Aden to take delivery of trie dhow, when handed over. 8 . The reference in the concluding paragraph of the Italian Note to the recognition by the British local author ities of the propriety of the Italian proceedings is not fully understood by His Majesty’s Government. The Acting PoliticalPolitical resident at Aden did indeed at one time suggest to tne Political Agent at Muscat that the Nakhoda might be in- duceu to settle tne matter as desired by the Italian Consul General, but the Acting Resident was not primarily respons ible for dealing with the case, and it is understood that the sjggcstion referred to was only made on the hypothesis that the presentment of the case by the Italian Consul General would be accepted by the British authorities having cognis ance of the facts. 9. His Majesty’s Government have very carefully consid ered ufie statements made in the Italian Government’s Note, out looking at the matter from the broadest point of view, they have been unable to avoid the conclusion that in this particular instance tnere has been a misapprehension of the business in which the boatmen were engaged, and that the en- lorceraent of measures wnich might be necessary for the sup pression of the arms traffic was not justified in this case. Trie special need for.prudence and caution in exercising the right of search in the case of vessels under a foreign flag was emphasised in Article 9 of the Instructions laid down in 1904 lor Naval Officers. Though those instructions may not havehave been applicable in the present case, the Italian Govern ment would have no doubt desired that the same spirit of moderation should have regulated the action of the Hafun authorities in dealing with the dhow in Hafun harbour as that prescribed for Naval Officers . 10. ms Majesty's Government appreciate fully, however, t.ie xrienaly spirit in which the Italian Government's Note is written, and they are gratified to learn that the Italian Government recognise, as they do themselves, the importance 01 the common interests of the two Governments in the suo- pression of the traffic in arms on the coast of Somaliland. ir Jyndham to 190 9 A ' AS observed in Mr - hyndham's Note of the 18th June last the Sultan of Muscat has it in his power to no small degree to further or impede their common policy, and the most recent information in the possession of His Majesty's Government snows that His Highness’s mind has been deeply stirred by the incident now complained of. He has also been urgently pressed by his subjects to defend their interests and has only succeeded with difficulty in exercising on them a res- training influence. 11. His Majesty's Government trust that in the event of any adverse decision being arrived at by the tribunal at As sab« Assab in the case of the “Kadra”, the Italian Government will be pleased to issue orders to the local authorities to refrain from giving it effect, pending the result of nego tiations between the tv/o Governments. They would further earnestly ask that the dhow should be returned with its contents and that some compensation should be granted to the owner and the Sultan of Muscat for the expenses which have been incurred. They are willing moreover to use their influence with the Sultan to induce him to acknowledge the technical legality of the seizure and to undertake oo in stitute in the future a system of marking arms. 12. Such a settlement, if accepted by the Italian Gov ernment, would presumably also apply to another dhow, the M Tarak\ as to the confiscation of which His Majesty's Gov. emment are at present witnout full details.Minute Paper.

Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before Viscount Morley, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s /• Ambassador at Rome on the subject. Lord Morley will observe that Sir R. Rodd requests instructions as to the position which His Majesty's Gov ernment claim to occupy as representing the foreign in terests of the Sultan of Muscat towards third Powers. Sir E.

He considers therefore that the action ta- -40G| :o 09 f Oi hiGj£ I ken by His Majesty's Government should be defended if necessary Secretary of State, India Office.(35834/09) necessary on the ground that it Is of paramount import ance to the policy pursued hy the two Governments in regard to the ams traffic to maintain the Sultan's goodwill and that in the instance of the dhow 'El Khadra' the proceedings of the Italian Authorities ap peared to His Majesty's Government prejudicial to this common policy.

Secret Department. From Viceroy, 5th October 1909. 1 Foreign Secret. Hafun incident. Your telegram of the llth A.ua us t Following telegram, dated 27th September, received from Political' Went' Muscat:— &gt; Omar has sent through me a process to the Sultan summoning the captains of two confiscated dhows—Tarak and Kadra—to appear on the 25th October before the Court of Inquiry at Assab. The Sultan replied on my advice, that he is pleased to hear matter at issue will be inquired into judicially, and ho hopes that result of this will be a complete vindication of his subjects; regretting that he is unable to send the captains to Assab, and and intimating that he has requested British Government to act for him in the matter.” Case has been referred to judicial authorities presumably under Italian municipal law. Holland anticipates that dhows will certainly be condemned As regards Italian note. Destruction of flags was reported simultaneously to Consuls, Zanzibar and Muscat, and to Sultan, and was not denied by Italians in first instance. Fact that rifle discovered was ten years old is opposed to presumption that illegal traffic was intended. Evidence can probably be procured to prove nakhoda’s statement that four rifles were landed at Sur. Little importance attaches to written declaration signed bv nakhoda under pressure when he wanted to get away. Decision to refuse delivery of dhows appears to have been due to claim to compensation, as Italians were originally ready to restore dhows. The statement that Aden authorities were convinced of legality of seizure and recognised forbearance N of Italian Government is incorrect—see Resident’s letter of the 24th July, f /2^[ 0 ^ ' copy forwarded with Secretary’s letter of the 19th August. But Acting ^ Resident did tell Consul-General that he had suggested to Political Agent, Muscat, to induce nakhoda to settle matter as desired by Consul-General,’ and asked him to delay submission of case pending Political Agent’s reply! It is important that support given to Sultan in this case should not result in establishment of Italian Consulate at Muscat. We think decision of Italian tribunal should now be awaited, and that Sultan should be warned that case may be prejudiced by non-attendance of &gt;/ / captains. Meanwhile, importance of loyal adherence of Sultan to^ffiotification L °f 1903 and possible effect on Sheikhs of Sur (Holland’s letter of tl#14th (F&gt; August) may perhaps usefully be impressed on Italian Government, who might be asked to issue orders to local authorities that any adverse decision of tribunal should not be carried out pending result of negotiations between two Governments. 4 /c-0 t. y ■ © O' 0and address— ^ \ /T^he Under-Secretary ot State, ;ion on No. In any further connnumca- on this subject, please quote ' Foreign Office Ixmdon.

I have the honour to forward the translation of a Notification issued by the Sultan prohibiting the export of arms to the Somali Coast, as desired in Foreign Department Letter No. 2373 E.-A., dated 6th October, and your subsequent telegram of 15th idem to my address. 2. As there are now Somali dhows in harbour, I have made it applicable to British subjects by a brief parallel notice as in previous cases.2 Translated purport of a Notification issued by His Highness the Sultan on 17th October 1903. To all whom it may concern— Be it known that, in pursuance of an understanding come to by the Governments of Great Britain and Italy, the importation of arms and warlike stores to those portions of the African coast and islands (including Socotra) lying to the north of Has Aseer {i.e.. Cape Guardafui), which are under the British Protectorate, and also to those parts of the African Coast, which are under the Italian Protectorate, has been prohibited. Accordingly, at the request of the British Government pursuant to her understanding with the Government of Italy, I hereby notify the said prohibition. Be it, therefore, known that any native craft transporting arms or warlike stores to the localities in question will incur the risk of confiscation, and that I have granted the authority to British men-of-war to search, on my behalf, vessels which there is reason to suspect in this connection in Maskat and Oman waters, and similarly to search Maskat craft on the high seas if reason exists for suspecting them. Furthermore, I hereby grant authority to Italian ships of war also to search suspected Maskat vessels either in territorial waters or on the high seas. Notification.

I have replied to His Highness counselling patience and asking for further information about the recently caotured dhow I am doubtful whether suen information m || VW ■ i| x / : will be procurable because the Sur people have lost confidence in ipy ability to help them since the failure of the Italian authorities to hand ever the 'Hadra' at Aden. Bui I will try ^c ice. get hold of the Hakhcda and examine him. 3. His Highness the Sultan, although grateful for the assist-1 ^ 0 paraL^I^ 1 fay letter :329 dated 'A ril 1^09. assistance which the British Government are rendering him, is greatly worried by the situation at Sur. The Shaikhs are very excited about the whole matter because if Suri dhows continue to he liable to seizure and confiscation by Italians, the trade of the place 7/ill rapidly be extinguished. In view of the Italian threats, the Sur dhow owners are very anxious about the fate of their vessels if they despatch them to the African Coast this season, ana the; recently sent a message to the Sultan to the effect that they proposed to come to Thus cat in force in order to ascertain what the real nature of the difficulty is. They also intimated that if something was not dene scon they would take the law into their own hands and deal harshly with an^ dhows flying the Italian flag which appear in Oman waters. 4. The Sultan at once sent off Saiyid Taimur in the n hur-ul- 3ahar n with instructions to dissuade the dhow owners from their intention and to pacify the local exjLtement as d far as possible He lias just returned and his efforts, backed up by largesse,have been temporarily successful. But the trouble will go on growing until something decisive happens and I trust that the efforts being made on the Sultan's behalf by His Majesty's Government will seen produce a satisfactory result. t.

I am very sorry that all our efforts for revolving the question in an amicable way and quite favourable to the nakhoda of the 'Kadra' (guilty, however of hiding anas) have been unsuccessful.

He desires that 1 should receive the Baghla at Massowah and 500 gunnies (bags) and one bundle of 31,000 and that I should forego all other claims. I have not accepted the terms as I am afraid that he is indulging in tricks. Where is Massowah from Aden ? It is about half a month’s journey by sailing vessel. The season is over and all the Baghlas have left. This is the stormy season and I have there fore allowed the khallasis to go. They left by the Baghla of Wald Belal on the 1 st Jemadi-ul-Awwal 1327 ( 21 st May 1909 ). It may also be known to you that I have no money to speed the cause.

I have received this letter from the Nakhoda in reply to my telegram ask ing him to take charge of the Baghla.

Major Merewether forwards a further communication from the Italian Consul-General in which he attempts to justify the seizure of the dhow and its continued retention. The statements now made by M. Piacentini are inconsistent, in the follow ing respects, with those made in his previous letters :— (a) M. Piacentini now says that the Nakhoda did not produce the permit authorising him to carry 5 rifles until after the secreted rifle had been found. But in his letter No. 213, dated February 14th, M. Piacentini distinctly implied that the permit was produced with the dhow’s papers on its arrival, before the search took place. (b) M. Piacentini now says that arrangements were made by the Italian Government in February for the restoration of the dhow r , subject to the conditions that the Nakhoda should recognise the lawful ness of the seizure of the rifle, and of the temporary seizure of the dhow, and that he would bear all consequent expenses. But in the last paragraph of his letter No. 213, dated February 14th, the Consul-General intimated that the Italian Government had concurred in his proposals for the immediate release of the dhow with its Nakhoda and crew. Nothing was said about conditions. A'ain, in his letter No. 324, dated March 14th, M. Piacentini said that D he had a second time, instructed the Italian officers at Hafun to deliver the dhow * Kadra * to its Nakhoda, with its cargo and the money found on it, merely deducting from the latter any expenses that had been incurred for sending the dhow’s pas sengers to Zanzibar. Finally, in his letter No. 337, dated March 16th, written after receipt of my telegraphic intimation to the Resident regarding the Sultan’s claim for damages, M. Piacentini not only said nothing about the withdrawal of his unconditional offer of surrender of the dhow, but reiterated his assurance that the dhow would be at Aden by the middle of April.2 * 866 paragraph 1 of Italian Consul-General’s letter dated February 14th. t See his statement. (e) The Consul-General novr complains that the Nakhoda ran away from Hafun. The dhow was seized on December 22 nd*. The Nakhoda remained at Hafun -n * i -rr « f° r oncf month and 18 davs He therefore left Hafun on February 8 th, six days after the ,° r i e l S o£ the Italian Government or the release of the dhow and Nakhoda. j / In his letter No. 324 dated March 14th. M. Piacentini referred to the return of the Nakhoda to Maskat, but made no complaint that the man had exhibited had faith by so doing. dn fact it was in view of the Nakhoda’s absence from Hafun that M. riacentini volunteered to deliver the dhow at Aden. . , S - Th ^ ™ (lf!on anxiet y °l tte Italian authorities to retain the dhow, in violation of their promise to deliver it, seems to shew that they realise the weakness of their position. The release of the dhow in accordance with the offei pieviously made, could be effected without prejudice to the disposal by the usual tribunals of the Sultans claim for damages, and if the Italian Govern- tion the?? ^ ^ the seizure to be justifiable under the Brussels Oonven- tion they might be expected to adopt this course. t( r ? 0 S ? c ^ n . onI y h .

Iso. A.-1293, dated Aden Residency, the 25th May 1909. From— Major J. W. B. Merewbther, Acting Political Resident, Aden, To—The Political Agent, Maskat. I have the honour to inform you that on receipt of your letter No. 412 of the 21st April 1909, which was presented to me by one Abdullah-bin-Hilal and not, as stated by you, by Hashid-bin-Khamis the brother of the Nakhoda of the dhow 4 Kadra ’, I asked the Consul-General for Italy to arrano-e for the delivery of the dhow to Abdullah and his crew. It appears that Abdullah had no power to come to any settlement and it is not possible, therefore, for me to do anything further i^the matter at present. I attach for your inform ation copy of a letter No. 570 of the 20th instant which the Italian Consul has addressed me. If the tacts stated by him are correct, the conduct of the Nakhoda stems to have been rather suspicious and the Italian authorities no doubt felt themselves justified in seizing the dhow. As one of the contracting paiiiesto the Druxelles Conference we cannot with propriety be too censorious of the action of the Italian authorities j and it would he well if you could induce the Nakhoda to settle the matter amicably. Otherwise the case is likely to drag on in the Italian courts with much expense and doubtful results to the Nakhoda. I am asking the Italian Consul not to submit the case to the court pending receipt of your reply.No. 570, Oggette, dated Aden, the 20th May 1909. From—-E,, Piacentini, Acting Consul-General for Italy, Aden, To—Tke First Assistant Resident, Aden, Acting Political Resident, Aden. With reference to the daw * Kadra ’ matter and how things have passed, 1 beg to make the following statement:— On last month of December 1908, the Commander of the R. Daws became aware that on board of the “ Kadra ” moored in Hafun there was a rifle. An accurated searching which owing to the quantity of merchandise and the large size of the daw, lasted two days, remained fruitless. The Nakhoda duly examined persisted denying the existence of arms of any kind. However the rifle was discovered hidden between a mat and the stretcher where a woman was lying pretending to he unable to rise up owing to her being in a family way. As soon as the rifle was discovered, the Nakhoda exhibited a document in force of which he was authorised to carry five rifles and 500 cartridges and the woman did not find any more necessary to be in family way and to lie on the stretcher. The rifle as you have seen did not bear the mark prescribed by the Bru^elle 5 Act. Considering the importance of the cargo and the size of the daw, the Italian Government choosed to be lenient and therefore dispositions were given for the restoring of the daw provided the Nakhoda will recognise the lawfulness of the definitive seizure of the rifle, of the temporary seizure of the daw and that he will bear all arising expenses. While this Consulate was dealing the matter with the Italian Government, through the Sultan Othman Mahmood intercession, the Nakhoda was left free but delivered to the said Sultan who held himself responsible for him. The Nakhoda however with evident bad faith ran away and claimed to the Sultan of Maskat who through the British Agent advanced exorbitant pretentions. Notwithstanding this the Italian Government made the proposal of a friendly settlement. It was not the Nakhoda himself who called here but a messenger from the Sultan who had no authority whatever neither from the Sultan nor from the owner of the daw, as on the telegraphing to the Sultan whether he gives authority to accept the Italian Government proposal, the Sultan replied intimating that nothing had to be accepted before his orders were heard. Now it is evident that the Sultan of Maskat and the British Agent who very likely were misinformed by the Nakhoda, are not, so far, persuaded of the two principal facts— ( 1 ) Of the perfect lawfulness not only of the rifles seizure but also of the daw. (So the Italian Government will have all advantages if a case will take place in the court). (2) Of the Italian Government lenience in all the matter, lenience that that was addressed towards a British protege. I shall feel therefore much obliged by your making the Sultan and the British Agent at Maskat understand all this and by your informing them that if they do not intend to accept the Italian Government proposal of settlement, I, after ten days, shall forward to the court of Asmara all necessary documents and papers where the Government have already given orders for the initiating of the case. P. S'.—The Nakhoda Abdullah Hilal is still in Aden, waiting for the orders of the Sultan of Maskat.* Enclosure 2. No. 1326, dated Bushire, the 5th (received Hth) June 1909. From— Major P. Z.

Holland, I.C.S., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, I have the honour to refer to the las 1 ; sentence of paragraph 6 of my letter No. 319, dated 2nd April 1909, on the subject of the seizure of a Maskat dhow by Italian authorities. 2. The Sultan informed me on April 13th that Mubarak bin Khnmis, the Nakhoda of the captured vessel had refused to so to Aden to remove his dhow and that there was much discontent at Sur regarding the destruction of the Oman flags. As the French Consul had announced his intention of proceeding shortly to Sur, and as I feared that the malcontents might appeal to him for the grant of French flags I went to Sur myself on Wednesday 14th April in H. M. S. “ Redbreast ’* and returned on April 16th. 3, I found Mubarak bin Khamis sulking in his house and had considerable difficulty in getting him to come and see me. lie said that he had lost all his money and that the Sultan would not help him, and that he could not go to Aden as t&gt;m season was too advanced. I persuaded him finally to collect a nucleus crew and to come back with me in II. M. S. ‘ Redbreast » and I have since induced His Highness the Sultan to see enclosure i. advance a sufficient sum (Rs. 1,331-6) to Mubarak to cover the passage and expenses of a crew of 15 men by steamer to Aden. The party left on April 21st by See enclosure 2 . s i ow mail for Bombay en route for Aden and I furnished them with a letter to the Resident at Aden of which a copy is enclosed. 4. I hare promised His Highness to recommend that the sum advanced by him should be included in the claim to be presented to the Italian Government and 1 hope you will be able to support tbs strongly. _ pm expenditure seems to be absolutely necessary because according to my information the contra^ winds at this season do not permit of a sailing vessel going to Aden, and if th recovery of the dhow is postponed till next season the claim for the detcntio will naturally increase. 5 The Jennebeh Sheikhs at Sur made some pungent remarks about the superior advantages of a French flag in view of what had peurred, and seemed to tliink that it was useless to expect assistance from His Highness the Sultan. I assured them that His Highness was doing his best to vindicate his rights and said that I was assisting him in the matter. I added that I had no doubt that the Oman flag would be respected by the Italian ^ iu when carried by vessels engaged in lawful avocations. I trust that you will approve my action. 6 . With reference to paragraph 9 of my letter No. 339, dated 2 nd Apnl 1 qrtq t r»n V a now discovered that Mubarak bin Khamis, the Nakhoda ot the dhow “ Kadra ” formerly possessed a French flag which he exchange no on &amp; ago for an Oman flag.21 Statement showing the amounts paid by His Highness the Sultan of MosJcat to the Nakhoda and crew proceeding to Aden to bring back the dhow ' Kadra ”, Ks.

I have with great difficulty induced Mubarak bin Khamis, the Nakhoda of the dhow, to collect a nucleus crew and have despatched them to Aden by steamer for the purpose of removing the dhow. The hearer of this letter is Rashid bin Khamis, the brother of Mubarak, who is unable to go himself. I should be greatly obliged if you would assist him in every way possible in the recovery of the dhow from the Italian author ities, so that the ship may return to Sur before the south-west monsoon sets in. 3. I would suggest that the statement of any member of the crew who is capable of identifying the rifle seized should be taken by you, so that we may know whether the weapon was in reality an old one as alleged. I should be grateful if you could recover from the vessel and forward to me by post the original permit for the possession of five rifles, which Mubarak says he had when the dhow was seized.

According to report, dated 2nd April, subsequently received from Political Agent, Maskat, which corroborates facts as regards seizure of dhow “ Kadra,’ complaints have been received by Sultan that Italian authorities at Hafun have also confiscated flags of about thirty Maskat vessels. Orders were issued by Italian Government on 2nd February for immediate release of dhow which is beino* brought to Aden. Action of Italian authorities, and disrespect shown to his flag, have much annoved Sultan, who has applied for our assistance m securin' formal reparation from Italian Government and claims 8,528 dollars damages and Its. 1,331 which under advice of Political Agent ho advanced to Nakhoda of dhow to take crew to Aden. Sultan fears that his subjects will a^ain resort to use of French and other flags if his own flag affords no protec tion. Sheikhs commented on superior advantages of French flag on occasion of Holland’s recent visit to Sur in consequence of French Consuls visit to that place. Action of Italian authorities is regarded by Cox and Holland as un justifiable, and they urge that we should give effective support to Sultan and make a representation with a to view obtaining reparation from Italian Govern ment.

In continuation of telegram from Maskar^SoT 449 of 29th ultimo. Yesterday Umberto Omar, Italian Agent at Maskat, received a telegram in reference to capture of dhow Kadra from Italian Consul-General at° Aden. This morning he attempted to approach Sultan of Maskat direct, but His Highness refused to discuss the question with him since, firstly, British Consul was already assisting him in his claim for damages against Italians, and, secondly, because so far he, Umberto Omar, had not brought any letter from his Government authorising him to act in a Consular capacity. Umberto came to see me subsequently and explained what had been said to him by Sultan of Maskat and (asked) for my good offices to press His Highness to agree immediately to the following proposals of Italian Government. “ Dhow Kadra will be returned to Abdulla Hilal (Sultan of Maskat’s representative at Aden) by Italian Consul-General at Aden, subject to the following conditions:— Firstly .—His Highness to instruct Abdulla Hilal by telegraph to sign an agreement in Sultan of MaskaPs name recognising legality of the seizure. Secondly .—Abdulla Hilal to renounce all his claim to his 1,000 dollars which was on board of dhow at the time of seizure, because (a) this sum has been spent by Italian Government in sending to Zanzibar passengers found on board of dhow, and (b) in sending dhow to Massowah and Aden from Hafun. Thirdly .—That Abdulla Hilal undertakes, in Sultan of Maskat’s name, in name of the master of the dhow, and in the name of everybody else who claims an interest in the dhow, to resign all and every claim for compensation on account of seizure of dhow. Fourthly .—That Abdulla Hilal agrees that the rifle found on board remains confiscate ”. Terms of the agreement end. Umberto went on to say that Italian Government will return dhow only on these conditions. Further, that matter will be referred to prize court if Sultan of Maskat does not agree. He continued his remarks by saying that if pro posals are agreed to at once by Sultan of Maskat an amicable precedent between himself and the Italian Government will be established. Umberto thereby hopes that Sultan of Maskat will then be shown every consideration by Italian Government, and an apology for the destruction of his flag will be offered bv them. Umberto personally promised his utmost exertions to see Sultan of Maskat should have satisfaction in this matter. Failing this, Umberto declared to me that he would have to telegraph to his Government for authority accrediting and appointing him Consular Agent here, so that he may per sonally be able to treat with Sultan of Maskat directly about matter. He expressed himself as unwilling to do this and asked for my especial assistance to press Sultan of Maskat at once over this affair on the grounds of friendship between English and Italian Governments. Sultan of Maskat indignantly repudiates what he considers injustice of proposals. He asks for your special support and that of Government of India to protect him in matter. As Umberto is pressing for a reply at once from Sultan of Maskat, please send mo fullest instructions by telegraph as to how you wish me to deal with incident. Ends.

Following telegram sent to Political Agent, Maskat -.—Begins. Please see your telegram No. 496 of 12th instant. Italian Agent may be informed2 verbally by you that Sultan of Maskat requested British Government some months ago to represent his interests in this case and to communicate his protest and claim for damages to Italian Government. Remind Agent that we have received specific instructions that his position in Maskat is merely that of informer in connection with arms traffic, and inform him that you cannot without definite instructions from Government, to whom present proposals oL^ Italian Consul-General and remarks of Mons. Omer are being communicated? ^ discuss present case with him, nor tender any advice to Sultan in the sense V desired. After verification from file, you might remind Mons.

In continuation of my letter No. 723 of 21st March and telegram No. 335 of 1st April, i have the honour to forward a copy of a further communication from Maskat Agency No. 339 of and April &gt;909. the Political Agent Maskat, on the subject of the treatment of Maskat dhows by the Italian authorities on the Benadir Coast. 2. I feel sure that His Highness the Sultan will have the effective support of His Majesty’s Government in this matter, for it is patent that the truculent action of the Italian officials has a very prejudicial bearing on questions closely affecting our own interests as well as those of the Sultan. 3. Government are well aware that the chief reason always paraded by the French Flag Holders at Sur, for taking the French Flag, a practice which after being a constant thorn in our side for 20 years, has recently been satisfactorily suppressed after an immensity of trouble, was the fact that as long as they flew the mere Arab flag, they had no peace while at sea from the inconvenient atten tions of Men-of*war, while the adoption of French colours brought them absolute immunity. Having practically dictated the Sultan’s conduct all through the tedious steps which led up to the Hague award, it is incumbent upon us to give him all possible support in the present difficulty, in which it would appear from the list of Nakhodas whose flags have been seized by the Italians, that several families which, formerly included French Flag Holders, are affected. 4. There is one point of view, however, from which the action of the Italian authorities may not prove an altogether unmitigated evil. In the past, in connection with the same French Flag question, we have repeatedly endeavoured to induce His Highness to adopt for his^subjects a dis tinctive flag or a distinctive superficial device, which w^ould distinguish the craft of his subjects, on near inspection, from those of all and sundry who sail under the plain red flag of Islam. 5. Hitherto Sir Seyyid Faisal has proved obdurate in his refusal or profes sed inability to introduce such a change, his arguments being, that the Arab flag is an independent flag ; that his subjects have flown it from time immemorial, and that any change however inconsiderable would rightly or wrongly be inter preted by his subjects as subversive of their and his independent status, and would consequently not be tolerated by them. 6 We have been met by the same difficulty in connection with the endea vour t induce the Truci/Sheikhs to fly the correct Trucial Treaty Flag especially in the case of the Sheikh of Abu Thabi who however has often stated to me that if Seyyid Faisal changed his flag, he (Sheikh Zaeed) would no longe object to doing the same. ^ . I suggest that the present incident might be made use of to revive the nuestion of a distinctive flag for Maskat; we intimating to His Highness after obtainine redress for him in the present instance, that he must now surely realise that our previous advice to him on this subject, was given him :n the real interest of himself and his subjects j and that the fact is that so much contraband traffic is carried on indifferent localities under the red flag that_until he can bring him self to formally adopt some distinctive device as now again recommended, it will be verv difficult for His Highness or ourselves to rest assured that the vessels of hfs seagoing subjects will always be treated with the degree of consideration due to the status of their overlord as an independent Ruler. v In any case pending an expression of the views of Government, nothing will be lost by the Political Agent using the opportunities of friendly persona! intercourse in connection with the present proceedings of the Italian authorities to influence His Highness in the right direction.2 1 wwi in m No. 339, dated Maskat, 2nd April 1909. From R.E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, iVi 3.S K clt j • See my telegram Nos. 334 - 5 ,dated 31 st March and further papers enclosed. To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to address you in continuation of my letter No. 2^ dated 6ih March 1909, on the subject of the seizure of a Maskat dhow at Hafun by Italian authorities. 2. Since my last letter His Highness the Sultan has received further com plaints* from his subjects to the effect that the Italian authorities at Hafun have con- . , , . , fiscated the flags of about thirty Maskat vessels, and have seized a badan. In view of these complaints and having regard to the fact that the Italian Consul-General at Aden does not f admit that the t See Major Merewether’s letter No. 702 -A., Nakhoda of the dhow Kadra ’’ has any dated 20 th March 1909 , copy enclosed. ’ right to damages, His Highness now f . . desires to ask the assistance of the Govern ment 01 India in securing formal reparation from the Italian Government. As the t m. Omar, the Italian Agent here, is simply a Sultan has no{ means of approaching the 'No'.XZ'daf.? It ^ ian Government direct, and as it is our , . . . pohcy to lend him reasonable support in his relations with foreign powers, I trust that his request may be granted, in accord ance with the recommendation already made in your letter No. 723 dated 21st March 1909, to the Government of India. 3* The following is a brief prdcis of the facts. On 22nd December 1908 M. Fiore, the Italian Lieutenant at Hafun, search ed a Maskat dhow named f ‘ Kadra ” on its arrival at that port. He found one See Italian Consul-General’s letter t 0 Resident rifle in the boat, hidden under a carnet and at Aden, No. 213 , dated 14th February 1900 . r-k’ * . . U ... , , y he re £ ar ded this discovery as justifying him m seizing the dhow, partly because the rifle had not on its stock the marks required by article IX, paragraph 5 of the Brussels Convention, and partly because the Nakhuda of the boat, although possessing a written license from the Copy enclosed. Suitan of Maskat to carry five rifles for , , . ._ , protection, had assured the Lieutenant that he had no rifles on board. 4 . As regards the question of marks, I do not see that the Article of the Brussels Convention, quoted by the Italian Consul-General, applies to the case at all. The weapon had not been imported into any of the prohibited territories mentioned in Article VIII of the General Act, and there was no evidence to show that importation was contemplated. The possession of the rifle by the Nakhoda w f c°v er ed by the license which he held from the Sultan of Maskat countersign ed by the British Consul, and the Lieutenant’s disregard of the document appears to constitute an affront not only to His Highness but to the British Government whose officer countersigned it. The Nakhoda explains that he assured the Lieut enant that there were no rifles on board because he had ordered all the rifles to be landed at Sur, before leaving Oman territory, doubtless in anticipation of some such difficulty as has arisen. One of the crew, however, retained on board an old rifle which he had had for 15 years and which had been given to him by the Sultan of Maskat. I see no reason to doubt the truth of this statement, but in spection of the rifle seized would afford a valuable test, if there were no doubt of its identity. I have asked the Resident at Aden to try and get hold of it. 5. For the above reasons I venture to think that the seizure of the dhow was an unjustifiable act, and that the Italian Government should be held respon sible for any loss or damage that may have resulted from it. The Italian Government appear to have recognised the unpropriety of their 5 See Italian Consul-General’s letter to Resident subordinate’s action by giving orders^ on .«Aden, dated MthFebnnr, ., 09 . 2nd February for the immediate release or the dhow and its crew,6. The Nakhoda assessed* his losses at $10,008 provided that the dhow • See hi&lt;? statement before m«. were returned to him with all its contents fj $1,450 half the total of advances to crew, in good condition. TheSultanonscruti- which should be recoverable locally. r ,, , • , .. __ A , a. $30 overcharge for boat hire to Mokala. ® Claim reduced it tO $8,528 by Sub' /Ck Total 1,480. stracting the items! shown in the margin, ~ but His Highness informed me that in his opinion the Nakhoda ought, in fairness, to be granted a free passage for himself and a new crew by steamer from Bombay to Aden as the winds are contrary for sailing boats now. I venture to think that the above claim is a reasonable one and that the Italian Government should be pressed to pay the money. As the Italian Consul-General is having the dhow brought to Aden, I am suggesting to His Highness that the Nakhoda should be sent at once to Aden by steamer with a crew to take possession of it. 7. But His Highness the Sultan desires not only to press his subject’s claim for material damages, but also to secure reparation for the insults that appear to have been wantonly offered to his flag by the Italian authorities on this and other occasions. In his deposition before me, the Nakhoda of the dhow stated positively that as soon as the Italian officer boarded the dhow he seized the Sultan’s flag, which was flown at the stern of the boat, and tore it. If this story is true, and there seems no reason ito doubt it, a very serious breach of international courtesy was committed. Apparently the flag was destroyed before the Italian officer had any reason to suppose that search would reveal illicit rifles, but even if the boat had been found to be full of contraband cargo I imagine that the destruction of the flag would not have been an act justified by international practice. 8. However, from the further complaints of destruction of flags which the Sultan has just received, it seems likely that the Italian authorities at Hafun regard the Maskat flag as the private ensign of the illict arms runner. If the complainants’ stories are true, the Italians have not only confiscated the flags of This is how the Sultan interprets the petitions of more than thirty Maskat boats in Spite of which copies are enclosed. the fact that no arms were found in the boats but have also threatened the Nakhodas with the severest penalties if they return again to the Somali Coast without English, French, Italian or German flags. I venture to think that if the facts are as alleged, the matter is very serious indeed. 9. The Sultan is naturally very much upset not only on account of the personal insult to himself but because he fears that his subjects on being forcibly convinced that his flag is no protection will cast about to procure foreign flags and grave difficulties similar to those recently settled in the French flag case will then arise. The Sultan is now anxiously enquiring whether any of the dhows whose flags w r ere seized formerly carried the French flag. If so, he will be stultified m the eves of his subjects. In any case, unless speedy and satisfactory assurance is given that the Sultan’s flag will be respected in future when borne by Maskat dhows engaged in lawful avocations, the Oman sea borne trade with the African Coast will suffer severely in the coming season. 10 It is hardly neressarv to point out the extreme gravity of the flag question to ourselves. We have just settled the French flag case with an infinite expenditure of time, labour and money, but if the Italians are alloued to persist in their present course, our efforts will have been largely in vain. I therefore venture to recommend that the strongest representations should be made to the Italian Government to secure damage for the losses sustaine y the Nakhoda of the “ Kadra,” reparation for the insults to the Sultan s flag and an immediate assurance that proper respect will in future be accorded io flat* His Highness leaves it to the Government of India to decide v\ hat tor reparation for the insults should take if they find it possible to press his claim. 11. As a matter of tactics the Italian policy appears to be particularly shortsighted. The Sultan has always shown himself ready to co-operate in4 preventing the export of arms to the African sea board. He issued a proclama tion on 17th October 1903 by which the export of arms and ammunition to the Italian possession in Africa is forbidden, and he rendered us willing assistance in the action which we took last year to prevent the shipment of arms by Italian Somali dhows. He is not likely to continue this assistance if he is insulted the Italian authorities, nor can he be expected to facilitate the work of thtr* newly arrived Italian informer, M. Omar. 12. The fact is that there is hardly any inducement for arms merchants here to send their goods to the African Coast which is adequately and more cheaply supplied from Djibouti. I believe that M. Omar, the Italian informer here, is now convinced of this fact. List of enclosures to Maskat letter No. 339, dated the 2nd April 1909. 1.

Please see correspondence regarding seizure of Muscat dhow by local Italian authorities forwarded with Secretary’s letter No. 17 M, dated 22nd April. According to subsequent report from Political Agent at Muscat, dated 2nd April, which corroborates facts as regards seizure of dhow ‘ Kadra,’ Sultan (? sent in) complaint that Italian authorities of Hafun have also confiscated flags of about thirty Muscat vessels. Italian Government gave orders on 2nd February for immediate release of dhow, which is being brought to Aden. Sultan, who is much annoyed at action of Italian authorities and disrespect shown to his flag, has applied for our assistance in securing formal reparation from Italian Government, and claims 8,528 dollars damages, and Rs. 1,331 which, under nakhoda of dhow to take crew to Aden. Holland’s advice, he advanced to Sultan fears that, if his flag affords no protection, his subjects will again resort to use of French and other flags. When Holland recently visited Sur in consequence of French Consul’s visit to that place, Sheikhs commented on superior advantages of French flag. Cox and Holland regard action of Italian authorities as unjustifiable, and urge that effective support may be given to Sultan, and representations made with a view to obtain reparation from Italian Government. We have now received following telegrams, dated 15th May, from Cox :— (1.) “No. 1000. Following from Muscat:—‘No. 496, dated 12 th May. ‘ In continuation of Muscat telegram No. 449, 29th April.

His Highness to telegraph to Hilal to sign 4 an agreement in Sultan of Muscat’s name recognising legality of 4 the seizure; (2.) Abdulla Hilal to renounce all his claim to his 4 thousand dollars which was on board dhow at the time of seizure, 4 because (a) Italian Government has spent this sum in sending to 4 Zanzibar passengers found on board of dhow, and (b) in sending 4 dhow from Hafun to Massowah and Aden; (3.)

Remind Agent that we have been specifically instructed that his position in Muscat is simply that of informer in connection with arms traffic, and inform him that you cannot discuss present case with him, nor tender any advice to Sultan of Muscat in the sense desired, without definite instructions from Government, to whom present proposals of Italian Consul- General and remarks of Monsieur Omar are being communicated. “ You might remind latter, after verification from files, that Italian Consul- General received instructions in January last to release the dhow, and that the crew have been sent from Muscat to Aden by Sultan of Muscat at considerable expense on the express understanding, conveyed in letter from Italian Consul-General to Resident at Aden, that dhow would be ready for delivery on their arrival. Also point out to him that il dhow is detained until after monsoon owners claim for damages will be considerably augmented. “ Inform Sultan of Muscat verbally of purport of your reply to Italian Agent, and advise His Highness to maintain the present attitude pending the receipt of the views of the British Government. Addressed to Muscat; repeated to Foreign.” (3.) “No. 1002. My immediately preceding telegram. Question regarding rifle and dollars can be discussed at leisure ; but it is most important that dhow should reach Sur before monsoon has commenced. It required considerable persuasion to induce Sultan of Muscat to provide 1,200 rupees for despatch of crew to Aden, and he did so on the under-/ standing that dhow was at owners’ disposal. French Consul now at Sur, and failure on our part to obtain adequate reparation for Sultan will be most harmful to our interests in Oman. Addressed to Foreign and repeated to Muscat.” We consider that action of Italian authorities was calculated to prejudice success of attempt to obtain co-operation of Sultan in suppression of arms traffic, and may lead to Sultan’s subjects reviving use of foreign flags, a practice which it is to the interests of both Governments to prevent. We trust that, in view of the friendly desire to co-operate hitherto evinced by Italian Government, representations to them may result in obtaining reparation for Sultan, and compensation for his losses.

The sultan of Maskat has received complaints from his subjects from Mombasa that flags of roughly about thirty Maskat vessels seized have been confiscated by local authorities at Hafun. Italians searched vessels without finding any arms and Wakhodas have boon warned not to return to somali Coast Protectorate in future without English, German, Italian or French flags, on pain of capital punishment. I should be glad to receive full information. What are the facts? The sultan of Maskat naturally much vexed, and, apart from the question of redress if information may be relied on, is anxious for assurance that his flag will be respected in future when flown by Maskat vessels engaged in lawful trade.

Even on their own showing (vide the letter of 14th February from the Acting Consul for Italy at Aden) the local Italian authorities concerned have, I venture to consider, acted with most unjustifiable severity, and I trust that if the necessity arises the Government of India will feel able to recommend His Majesty’s Government to accord the Sultan of Maskat their fullest support in obtaining the reparation that seems fairly to be called for. It is to be hoped, however, that the Italian Government will not be slow to realise that such an incident could hardly have taken place at a more completely inopportune time than the present, they having only just sent an Agent to Maskat who is entirely dependent on our countenance and good offices for a friendly reception, or even toleration by His Highness the Sultan.

Italian authorities have released Maskat dhow. Letter follows. Translated purport of a letter dated the ** ^ from His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. I have received a letter from some of my subjects regarding a boat which plys between Africa and Maskat, informing me that they have suffered a lot from the 896 F.D.hands of the Italians who have acted very much against rules, and that they do not trouble any one flyi g any other flag. I request you to kindly investigate into the matter and let me know the result of your enquiries. I am forwarding the petition addressed to me by my subjects. Translated purport of a letter dated the ^f. V ^ urru ' n from Suleiman Khamis, SO'n Ja-xuary 190 c) Mohommed bin Ali, Ali Khalfan and the residents of Bani Bu Ali to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. On arrival of a boat near Hafun an Italian steamer approached and stopped the boat, ordered the boatmen to take down the flag and then they tore it into pieces and also confiscated a rifle belonging to one of the boatmen. wKich has been in his possession since the last fifteen years and which was given to him by You* Highness. We the subjects of Your Highness request you to kindly write a letter and have it signed by the British Consul and forward it to us. The boat and the rifle was taken to Hafun by the men of the steamer. The Commander of the vessel was told that the boat belonged to one of Your Highness' subjects, but he in reply said that Saiyid Faisal had no subjects and neither any flag, and that the Bagla is the property of the Bani Bu Ali who are residents of Batineh. The boatmen told the officer that all the people of Bani Bu Ali are the subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat and so had every right of flying his flan. We are Your Highness’ subjects and when we sail flying your flag we are put to great trouble. We beg to inform you that the vessel captured by the Italians is still in their possession. The boat was captured on her way from Mokalla to Sohail with a lot of passengers and goods on board. A thing like this happening without any cause is very bad. We request you to investigate into the matter. We first used to fly the French flag and row that we fly Your Highness’ flag we are put into such trouble. Any boat flying any other flag is never molested. This Bagla was captured on the 6 th dDilhijar (1326) and up to now they have not released it. We are Your Highness’ subjects and the Bagla captured is the property of Mubarak bin Khamis bin Rashid wald Aboti Tammi, a subject of Your Highness.

Copy of a letter No, di prot, 213, da ted the^lith February 1909, from the Acting Consul-General for Italy at Aden, to the First Assistant to the Political Resi dent, Aden, With reference to your letter No. C,-37 of 1909, of 12th instant, I have the nonour to inform you that on the 22nd December 1908 a dhow named Kadra with Maskat colours was efiectively seized by the Italian authorities at Ras Hafun. The dhow had its regular papers, and was authorised by the Sultan of Maskat to carry five (5) rifles and 500 cartridges for the protection of his boat. When the dhow arrived to Hafun the Italian Lieutenant, M. Fiore, Com mander of His Majesty’s dhow, went on board of Kadra for the regular search. But he did not find neither the rifles nor the cartridges. After many investiga tions he found hid under a carpet one rifle just when the Nakhoda assured that no rifle at all was in his boat. Besides the rifle so found had not on its stock the marks required by the Act of Bruxelles, Article IX, paragraph 5.V rt-.c © For these reasons, the Lieutenant seized the dhow, and sent to this Con sulate his report. I wrote to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in Rome, explaining the case and suggesting to give orders to deliver immediately the dhow Kadra. In fact, on the 2 nd instant, I received the answrer from the Minister, w ith the order according my proposals^—to write to M. Fiore to release the dhow with bs Nakhoda and other men of the crew. W hat I did on the 3rd instant sending to M. Fiore an official note, with the S.S. Tuna which expressly stopped at Hafun. No. 287, dated Maskat, the 13th March 1900. From—R. E.

Nak’noda’s statement of losses. 2. The Nakhoda of the captured boat appeared here, and I examined him at the Sultan's requestinorder to ascertain particulars of his claim. He assessed his losses at $10,008 on the assumption that the dhow with its contents wmuld be returned to him in good condition. This figure was reduced by His Highness, after scrutiny of the items, to $8,528. 3. In order that His Highness might be in possession of all information available before proceeding, I despatched the telegram of which a copy is en closed, to the Resident at Aden. On receipt of his reply I will again address you. 4 At the request of M. Umberto Omar, Italian Agent here, I am providing him wdth a copy of the Nakhoda’s statement. I also arranged that M. Omar should have an opportunity of personnally questioning the Nakhoda about the matter. Copy of statement made on the 12th day of March K09, hy Mubarak bin Khamis el Alawi el Walad, Nakhoda of the dhow “ El Khadra”, before R. E. Holland, Esq. y Polit 'cal Agent and His Britannic Majesty*s Consul at Maskat. I am Nakhoda and owner of the El Khadra. I took the dhow from Basreh to Sur where we anchored ten days. It was about the 3rd Shawwa From Sur we went to Mokalla to sell the dates we brought from Basreh We left Sur on 12th Shawwal. On the 2nd Elka Ir we reached Mokalla. We sold all our dates there, except a few which we kept for eating. We took oOO bags of chunam. I had taken 6 boxes of dry grapes from Sur. I had $1,000 the payment for carriage of the dates and $300 as present. I had also 14 bags of rice and 35 bundles of dates and one parcel of amber sent with me by merchant. I do not know the price of it. From Mokalla I took 174 passengers for Mombassa. The rate agreed on was W for a man and $8 for a woman. A deposit of $2 was taken from each. I eft Mokalla on 17th Elkadr. I reached Hafun on Elkadr 25th. Then a lmien came Italian neople in it Then one Italian man and one tofangchi with him came iTto my boat P Immediately he arrived in the boat hewent and took the Sag and tore it^ The flag was the Sultan’s flag. It was flown at the stern. They took til buvaalow to the bunder. Then a boat containing four soldiers came from a W hucfalow belonging to the Italians. Then all the passengers were kept ashore. Then the Italian man examined the buggalow. When I left Mr skat I had five rifles and I had a written pe-mission from the Sultan to carry them. When I was at Sur I ordered all the five rifles to be landed and four were landed, but ope of i , r . np r ifl e unknown to me. There were no cartridges kept vith it. The ^b k^e^hef theTuigalow for rifles. He found the one rifle. The rifle Son d“ck underneath bedding. I said I had got a pass from the Sultan of M. skat4 for the rifle and also a letter from the British Consul. The Italian man then took me and the rifle and the papers all ashore. Then an Italian officer on shore asked me whohad written the papers I said the Sultan of Maskat and the British Political Agent, M skat The Italian officer asked if I had given some present to the British Political Agent for this writing. I said no. The Somalis there came and asked the Italian officer to let me go with my buggalow. The Italian officer next day sent the passengers—174 in all—to Mombassa in another boat. I did not take passage money from them. I kept the $2 from each passenger. It was only $300. There were 32 women and 142 men. The total passage money from them would have been $1,108. I therfore lost 808 dollars. After 12 days the Italians sent the crew of the buggalow with their belongings to Sawahil. The crew were 22. I had given them $1,800 as advance for the journey.. They were to trade with it for themselves. I asked the Italian not to send them I away because they had had this money from me. I alone remained in Hafun one month and 18 days. Every day the Italian said an officer would come and give orders, but it did not come. I paid $130 for a boat to Mokalla. The Somali Sultan helped. The Italian officer give me a receipt for the $1,000 taken from buggalow. There were also mats and carpets and other things in the buggalow. The passengers stole from my wife $180 gold ornaments. I hid them in a package when the Italians came, because I thought they would steal them. The passengers stole them. From Mikalla I took a small boat to Merbat and from Merbat came to Sur. From Sur I came here with letters from Jaalan and Sur to the Sultan and to the British Consul. I left Hafun to go to Mokalla on 8th Muharram. I have heard that the Italians have given the buggalow back. Now I have got no crew and nothing at all. The buggalow was properly sealed when I left. I claim compensation as follows :— (1) $1,000. The Italians counted this; it is in the bag. They took it when I first came to Hafun. The Italians have it now. (2) Goods in the buggalow— (a) Six cases dried grapes $48. (b) 500 bags of chunam $1,550. I bought this at Mokalla and paid $100 per 100 bags. I also paid $50 as duty at Mokalla for export on each 100 bags, in all $250. The empty bags cost $14 a hundred, in all $70 for 500. The cooly was $11 for 100 bags, $55. The freight for each 100 bags from Mokalla to Swahli was $37. I should have sold each bag at Swahli for Rs. 5, so that I should have got Rs. 2,500. I have, however, only put my loss at $1,550 (c) 35 bundles of dates $290. I got these dates from Basreh and Bami. These were for eating for the crew and a few for presents (d) 14 bags of rice $168. These we bought at Mokalla. Between Mokalla and Hafun we ate 3 bags of rice out of 17 and had 14 left. (e) Dried fish to amount of $70. I took this from Merbat. Some of this was for eating and some was for profit. (/) Amber $300. This I got from Sur. The total of these items is $2,426. (3) $808, the balance of the passage money which I should have received from passengers to Mombassa. (4) $1,800. I gave this sum as advance to the crew. I gave it them as advance for the last voyage but one. For this voyage I gave advance of $1,100. The rule is that these advances are given each voyage and are not repaid unless the men wish to leave the boat and go to some other Nakhoda. Then they have to pay half the money given. Now my crew have gone and I have lost all the advances. The total is $2,900.(5) 8 bundles of canvas, value $80. Part was for the sail and pair for trade. ( 6 ) Personal effects, carpets, clothes, cooking pots, $300. (7) Value of my wife's gold ornaments stolen $180. ( 8 ) Loss on trade which I should have done by purchasing cows, ghee and salt at Hafun for Sawahil and the Gulf of Zanzibar and by taking passengers $ 2 , 000 . I get this’ profit every year. (9) Paid for Badan from Hafun to Mokalla $130. (10) $3,500 loss on passage money, freight and trading on cargo wdiich I should have brought from African coast to Mokalla, Sur and the Persian Gulf. The goods are copra, semsem and timber. Also passengers. The total is $13,524. I do not know how to get my buggalow back here. It would cost $2,000 or $3,000. I should have to collect a new crew here and take them there. Now is not the time for sailing to Hafun, the wind and sea is against it. Only a steamer could go. If I get the $13,524 I will myself bear the loss of collecting a new crew and going to Hafun to take away the buggalow. If I get the $13,524 then the things mentioned in the list as being in the buggalow shall be for the Italians. Only the buggalow I want. The value of that is $6,000. If the buggalow is handed back to me with all its contents in good condition, namely as follows :— $ Cash • • • • .. .. 1,000 Dried grapes .. •. .. 48 Chunam (cost price and freight) — .. .. 1,060 Dates .. .. .. 290 Rice • • .. .. 168 Fish .. .. .. 70 Amber .. .. .. 300 Canvas • • ... .. 80 Personal effects • • ... .. 500 Total .. 3,516 Then I will reduce my claim to $10,008. I came to Mokalla in a little boat as I said. My nephew brought me from Mokalla to Sur, seeing that I had become poor. As I paid nothing for this, I have not made any claim for this for compensation.
