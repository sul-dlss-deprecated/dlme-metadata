The Reuter and other early Con cessions. t For an account of the Reuter Con cession, si's Dol'd Curzon s l ersia, 1S92, Vol. I., pp. 480-483. 1 . Hie preparation of this Memorandum was suggested by the submission by a Russian “ Con sortium ” of a scheme for the connection of the European and Indian railway systems by a line across Persia.* There are, however, other railways in Persia of which the construction, or “ ear marking ” has been or may shortly have to be considered. The Memorandum, therefore, deals with Persian railways generally. The early history of Persian railway projects has special interest at the present moment, since with the expiry in 1910 of the Russian prohibition of railway construction in Persia the r position has reverted to some extent to what it was before the end of 1890 when that prohibition took formal and definite shape (see paragraph 10 below). The idea, it may be mentioned, of railway connection with India by way of Persia is very old. The Select Committee of the House of Commons that reported in 1872 on the Euphrates Valley Railway mentioned the idea only to reject it:— “ As regards the terminus on the Persian Gulf, “ your Committee are decidedly of opinion that it “ would be better to carry the line to some point “ where it might be brought into communication “ with the steam vessels which are now under “ Government subvention to carry the mails, and “ which ply from the Indian ports to Basra, than “ to continue it along the coast to Karachi by a “ very expensive, and probably unremunerative “ route.” 2. Although then 1 had been other concessions for railways in Persia, the first of which mention need be made is that embodied in the Reuter Concession of 1872, a concession which, besides surrendering into foreign hands the entire indus trial resources of the country, conferred upon Baron de Reuter for the space of 70 yearsf an absolute S. 47. Amonopoly of railway and tramway construction in Persia. The concession was impracticable, and it was afterwards revoked. There followed the Falckenhagen Concession in 1874-75 for a line from Julfa to Tabriz, the Alleon Concession in 1878 for a line from Resht to Teheran, a plan for an American Concession, and one for an English Concession lor a line to I ehcran from the Upper Karun. In 1882 a M. Boital obtained a 'roup of railway concessions which resulted in the opening in 1888 of a railway about six miles long from Teheran to the shrine of Shah Abdul Azim. A second railway, about 12 miles long, from Mahmudabad on the Caspian to the town of A mol, was later constructed by native enterpiise, but this railway iell into disuse, and the insigni ficant Shah Abdul Azim railway is the only railway that Persia now possesses. 3. A few years later a Russian named Palash- kovskv had plans for joining the Trans-Caucasian Railway with Tehran,and at the beginning oi 1888 a draft concession was under discussion between the British and Persian Ciovernments foi &lt;i railway in the south from Mohanimerah to'Tehran.t A line from Tehran to Bagdad via Kermanshah was also spoken of, but no progress was made towards railway construction in Persia, and the year 1888 was marked by acute rivalry between Great Britain and Russia. The position ol Great Britain is clear from the instructions given in September to Sir H. Drummond Wolff, the British Minister, to the effect that he could not impress too strongly on the Shah that the only means ol enabling us to give him effectual support was to improve means ol communication with the 1 ersian Gulf. The Shah, however, in the previous year, had given an undertaking to Prince Dolgorouki, the Russian Minister at Tehran, in the following terms:— “ Whereas it is our sincere inclination to further “ demonstrate our confidence and trust in His “ Majesty the Emperor, who has always and on “ every occasion proved his sincere inclination and “ affection towards us, and inasmuch as it is our “ inclination to be always in entire affection and “ friendship with llis Majesty the Emperor, we have “ decided not to give orders or permission to con- “ struct railways or waterways to companies ol “ foreign nations before consulting with llis “Majesty the Emperor; and this advice and “ consultation will meet with our consideration, “ inasmuch as, should those concessions contain an “ article or clause detrimental to Persian interests, “ we can utilize the Emperor’s consultation “ and advice in order to avoid it, and protect “ ourselves against that detriment.

The position of Her Majesty’s Government was greatly complicated by this undertaking, and, in the end, alter lengthy negotiations, an assurance was given on the 24th October 1888, by Sir H. Drummond Wolff to the Amin-es-Sultan, with the approval of Her Majesty’s Government, to the following effect:— “ In the event of any Power making an attack without just cause or provocation on Persia, or attempting to take possession of*Persian territory against the will of the Persian Government, Her Majesty s Government engage to make earnest representations against such proceedings, and to “ lake such steps as may in their judgment be best “ calculated to prevent any infringement of the “ integrity of Persia. “It is understood that, in order to enable Her Majesty’s Government to carry out this engage ment, the Persian Government will give Her “ Majesty’s Government immediate notice of any “ demand threatening to the integrity of Persia which may be made upon them by any foreign “ Power.” The river Karim was then declared by the Shah to be open to the navigation of all countries. Mr. Clergue’s railway from Alexan- dretta to India. Russian projects for railways in North Persia, and from Caspian to Persian Gulf. Sir H. D. Wolff’s Despatch No. 5, 13th January 1889. (P. 59.) Lord Salisbury's Telegram No. 17, dated 4th February 1889. (P- 38.) Memorandum of Intelligence Depart ment, 7th March 1889. (P. 185.) 4. The next year (1889) was marked by the discussion of various more or less inchoate proposals lor railways in Persia, among them one by an American, Mr. Clergue, as to whom Sir H. D. Wolff reported in January in the following terms :— “ Mr. CTergue’s wish is to make a line from “ Alexandretta by Bagdad and Dizful to Tehran with a branch to iMohammerah, and to continue “ it later to join the Indian system by such a route “ as the Indian Government might select. A direct “ line would thus be found from the Mediterranean “ to the Persian Gulf and to India. He estimates “ the cost of the proposed railways at 6 , 000 £, a “ mile.” There was also some apprehension as to Russian projects in the north of Persia, and on the 4 th February 1889 Lord Salisbury instructed Sir H. D. Wolff that “ broadly speaking, the eastern districts “ of Khorasan are the highway for Russian flank “ attack on Afghanistan, and we should do our best “ to prevent Russian advances in this direction.” On the i th March 1889, the Intelligence Department of the War Office examined in a memorandum, under the four heads of ( 1 ) practi cability, (2) cost, (3) commercial value, and (4) military value, the projects above referred to, including lines from Askhabad to Meshed, and Sarakhs to Nasirabad, and in forwarding the memorandum to the Foreign Office, Sir H. Bracken- bury, the Director of Military Intelligence, made the following observations :— “ There is one point which I wish to emphasize. Khorasan is not only the base from which serious “ operations against India will be undertaken, if A 24 “ ever they should be attempted, but its possession is essential to Russia even for sustained opera tions in Western Afghanistan. This is clearly set forth in important Russian secret official “ papers. “ Even if we admit that sooner or later Khorasan must become a Russian province, and that Herat “ and Northern Afghanistan must fall to Russia, it “ is desirable to postpone the evil day as long as possible. Nothing would so hasten its arrival as “ the construction of such railways as are here contemplated, and nothing would so greatly add to Russia’s power for still further advance. “ The absorption of Khorasan into the Russian Empire, or even its control by means of railways in Russian hands, will compel India to add to her already heavy military burdens.” On the 15th Maich a further memorandum was prepared by the Intelligence Department on a projected Russian line of railway either from Resht or Baku, through Tehran, Kashan, Yezd, Kerman, and Bampur, to Charbar on the Persian Gulf, it was pointed out that, possessed of this line and established in Khorasan, Russia would control the whole of the Persian kingdom, and gain a position on the Indian Ocean that would necessitate an increase of British naval forces in Indian waters, and add to our already heavy burdens “ To sum up, the cost of the enterprise is very large, but the commercial results to be ultimately obtained (i.e. by Russia) may possibly be worth the outlay, while the strategical position to be attained, “ owing to the additional menace which it would involve to our position in North-Western India, might possibly be deemed sufficient to justify so “ large an undertaking.” 5. On the 20tli March 1889 Sir H. 1). W olff forwarded the following important engagement 0 given by the Shah with respect to railways m Persia, and with special relation to those in the south : - The Shah to the Munster for Foreign Affairs. “ (Translation).

Dated Ibth September 1\S. —And it is clear that in Persia nobody will be granted permission to construct railways, “ except it be solely commercial ones. We say so now that they may know it.” In subsequent despatches Sir 11. 1). Wolff in formed the Foreign Office of the conclusion of an agreement between the Shah and the Russian Government, the concluding portion of which ran as follows :— b. The Persian Government accepts that it should grant to a Russian Company the con struction in Persia of railways to anywhere where it may be advantageous to the commercial interests of both Governments, and the conditions of the Act of Concession are to be suitable and to the satisfaction of both parties, and for the discussion of this question the aforesaid Company is granted five years grace, within which period of five years no other company shall be granted permission to construct railways. After the ex piration of this term, or the signature of the “ Concession, the Persian Government is at liberty “ to grant permission to any Company to construct “ railways in any direction. If during these five “ years Russian companies do not wish to construct railways, the Persian Government is entirely “ freed from this its promise and agreement. “ In view of the acceptance of the aforesaid ” matters, the promise and agreement given to His “ Majesty the Emperor on the 14th Zi Hejjeh 1304, “ concerning waters and railways, is cancelled “ (literally, loses its credit.) “ Signed on the (sic) Rejeb, 1306, the year of the (sic). “ Given to His Excellency Prince Dolgorouki, “ Minister Plenipotentiary of the Russian Govern- “ ment. “ It is correct. “ (Sgd.)

(P. 1.) 6 . On the :2nd January 1890 Sir R. Morier telegraphed from St. Petersburg that a Commission presided over by M. A baza had been appointed to examine the scheme of a Syndicate largely sup ported by Russian capitalists, as well as by Germans and other foreigners, to construct a railway from Resht to Tehran, and on to the Persian Gulf. A 3Lord Salisbury thereupon suggested to Sir II. I). Wolff that “ it might be the best course not to “ oppose this scheme altogether, but to insist that “it should be an international one, in which “ English capitalists should have a share, that the “ Company should be domiciled in Persia and “ subject to Persian law, and all security taken “ against differential rates.” A few days later Sir 11. I). Wolff became pos sessed of a draft concession presented to the Persian Government by Russian applicants, the result of which would have been a practical monopoly to such applicants of all railways in Persia. On instruc tions from Lord Salisbury the following note was, thereupon, presented to the Persian Govern ment :— Lord Salisbury’s Telegram No. 3, 3rd January 1890. (P. 2). Sir H. 1J. Wolff's Telegram No. 32, 1st February 1890. (P. 26.) Sir H. 1). Wolff’s Despatch No. 35, 5th February 1890. (P. 49.) “ M. le Ministre, 1 st February 1890. “ As it is generally reported that applica tions are being addressed by foreign contrac tors to II is Majesty the Shah for concessions of “ railways in Persia, 1 venture to recall to the “ recollection of Your Excellency the gracious “ promise contained in the autograph of His “ Majesty the Shah, dated the 10th March . 0 By “ this document IIis Majesty was pleased to convey “ to me the solemn assurance:— “ 1. That whenever a railway concession may “ be given anywhere in Persia, a similar concession “ shall be granted to an English Company for a “ line from Tehran to the Persian Gulf. “ 2. That no concession of any kind will be “ given for a railway from Tehran to the south “ except in agreement with this Legation. “Her Majesty’s Government have charged me “ to remind Your Excellency of these engagements “ merely with the view of avoiding the possibility “ of any conflict of interests which may be caused “ by the applications at present submitted to Mis “ Majesty by others.” 7. About this time Sir H. D. Wolff laid stress Advocacy by Sir H. D. Wolff of a on the great hardship under which the trade of railway from the Caspian to Moham- Persia laboured from the cost and difficulty of mera h* transport, and he expressed the belief that aline D ’ VV ^J fts I)e 8 P atch No - 49 &gt; through Enzeli, Tehran, and Mohammerah, com- 1 * ebruarj 18 ^; bined with sea-transport from Mohammerah to ( ■ •) Karachi, would prove of the greatest commercial advantage to Russia, Persia, and India, lie advo cated an understanding between Russia, the Shah, and Great Britain under three heads: — “1. A declaration that the railway is to be (P.61.) “ considered neutral, much on the same lines as the “ neutrality of the Suez Canal. “ 2. The railway to be made under a Persian “ charter by an International Company in which the “ three Governments should be officially represented. “ 3. The ‘ Cahier des Charges 1 to be approved “ by the three Governments.”/ iro (P. 61.) Sir H. D. Wolff’s Despatch No. 261, 8th August 1890. (P. 48.) He considered that a minimum guarantee of 4 per cent, might be provided by ( 1 ) the increase oi me Customs consequent on the new traffic, (2) a low transit due to be raised per ton on all goods going through the country by the line, and his Despatch concluded with the following words “ ^ 1 cann ? t llel P thinking that the formation of ( the Committee in Russia is a proof of the desire u the commercial classes in that country to avail themselves of trade routes which cannot be overlooked. „ “ fhe Government of Russia might perhaps be „ P ers Haded to see the advantages to lie derived &lt;t trom thls hue of railway, which would be very u great on her side, and the course to be taken u woul&lt;l he such as to preclude the idea of stra tegical rather than trade purposes.” In a subsequent despatch Sir II I). Wolff forwarded a report by Mr. Macqueen, Civil engineer, on the suggested railway between Cnzeli and Mohammerah. Views of Her Majesty’s Government as to Russian Railways in Persia. Sir H. I). Wolff’s Despatch No. 137. 21st April 1890. (P. 45.) Lord Salisbury’s Telegram, 19th May 1890. J (P. 51.) 8 . In April of the same year a report was made by Sir II. I). Wollf to the effect that the A baza Commitiee were said to have in contemplation a Ime from Tiflis to Tabriz, Tehran, and Bunder Abbas. ^ On the 19th May the views of Her Majesty’s Oovernment were explained to him in a comprehensive telegram of which the following is a paraphrase :— „ ' dli reference to your despatches and other correspondence on the subject of railway con- cessions in Persia, there are tliree possible contingencies to be considered : — In the first place, it is by no means improbable u tiiat . the Russians will attempt to construct a line u P^ssmg through Khorasan in the direction of t&lt; H&lt;uat. I hey may employ Government funds t( U P 011 sucl1 a n enterprise. In this case 1 can only instruct you to offer the most strenous resistance, although L feel some doubt as to whether you will u Anothei line which the Russians may wish to u aiake is that from their own frontier to the Persian capital. It is not necessary that you “ should oppose it, but merely insist that a similar “ concession should be granted to us in the south, ‘ which should correspond in value and importance “ w,tl1 liic Russian line, and should be decided on “m consultation with Her Majesty’s Legation. The Russian Government would hardly be willing “ defray the expense of construction in this t instance, and it is very doubtful whether the money could be raised in other quarters. f&lt; I here remains, as the third contingency, the ^ Imc which you have mentioned, running across Persia from the Caspian to Bunder Abbas on the ^ ^ ersian Gulf. I feel certain that the Russian “ Government would not devote public funds to “the construction of such a line; it would be“ necessary to have recourse to foreign capitalists, “ and the success of an appeal to the public market “ would entirely depend on the attitude ol hnglanc “ towards the enterprise. If Her Majesty’s Govern- “ m ent were to announce that the construction o “ this railway would be regarded as an act of “ hostility towards England, and that they would not “ undertake, in the case oi any luture distuibances, “ to respect the property of the shareholders, or of “ any one connected with the line, it would be “ impossible to raise the necessary capital on any “ Stock Exchange in Europe. “ For the present, at all events, it is better to “ maintain a defensive attitude in regard to all “ projects of railway construction. Personally I “ I cannot think that we shall be called upon to “ decide as to the line of railway to be undertaken “ in Southern Persia until the Indian Government “ have extended their line troin Ohaman through “Baluchistan and Seistan. d here is, l believe, “ much divergence of opinion at Calcutta on this “ particular question ; but when once tbe Indian “ line is in working order up to Chaman, I feel convinced that, in spite of the reluctance now “expressed, the Government of India will feel it “ impossible to stop at that point, and will be “ obliged to face the necessity of a further “ extension. “ Jt seems scarcely probable that lor some time “ to come any line will be made from the 1 eisian “ Gulf to Tehran by English capital, on whatever “ terms a Concession for the purpose may be “ offered.” ( .i. It may here be observed that the opposition of Her Majesty’s Government to a Russian railway through Khorasan was throughout ol a determined character. In duly 1890 the instructions sent to Tehran on this subject were to the following effect : — “ l n the event of Russia endeavouring to force “ Persian Government to agree to a railway line “ through Khorasan, you should act on my telegram “of the 19th May.-' “ If the Shah asks how r far he can count upon “ the support of this country in resisting such a “ demand, you should renew the assurance given “ to His Majesty on the 21th October 1888.”t Opposition of Hor Majesty’s Govern ment to Russian Line through Khora san.

B“As Her Majesty’s Government must have ‘ gathered from all the correspondence, Khorasan ‘ practically belongs to hu^sia. * it i , ® ‘ pletion of the road from Askhabad to Meshed, thr ‘ stete of actual though not of titular possession is ‘ also completed. As regards Khorasan, I ersia is “ positively at the mercy of Russia, and with tie “ possession of that province, the whole of the “ north of Afghanistan is also menaced. The line was advocated by Sir H. Drummond Wolff also on commercial grounds, since beistan was a fertile district, of which development could be carried still further by a system of irrigation : ~ “ The price of grain,” moreover, “ and other com “ modities in Khorasan is so remarkably cheap “ that the province would provide a granary tor “portions of India, as well as it now ( ® es () ^ “ Traus-Oaspia, and in the same proportion the sale “ 0 f our goods in Persia must necessarily progress. “ if t,] ie Trans-Caspian Railway pays, the ic “ is no reason why a line fn&gt;m Quetta to Seistan, “one of the most fertile provinces m Persia “ should not prove e(|ually remunerative. At “ all events, it would give us access to l ersia “ all d her vast resources, and show that we were “ not deficient in developing progress^and in our “ intention to defend our own interests. 12 The views of Sir 11 D. Wolff were not shared by Sir H. Brae ken bury, the Director of Military Intelligence. In his opinion the important thing was that a line should be constructed froni Moham- merah to Tehran via Shuster, Bala-rud, Burujird, and Kum. It would tap the commerce of 1 ersia from the south, and in time branches might be thrown out from Burujird north-west to herman- shah and south-east to Ispahan, the latter being ultimately prolonged to Ve/d, and possibly, even, after a lapse of time to Kerman. “ All these towns are of commercial importance, “ and although the country, in its present condition, “ may not be able to support a railway, still, it ie “ development above hinted at be realized, such “a line might ultimately prove a paying concern “ Looking some distance ahead, it is possible that “ our Indian Empire may absorb and develop the “ whole of Baluchistan and possibly incorporate “ Seistan within its frontier. In that case our “ railway system might join with the Persian net “ work at Kerman, and it would then be certainly “ of advantage to have the line from Kerman via “Ispahan and Burujird in English hands: we “ should thus have a direct railway route from “ India to the Persian capital. But this is not all. “ for it is stated (by Colonel Mark Bell) that a “ railwav might be constructed readily from “ Kermanshah to Bagdad, and if this should turn “ ou t to be the case, it would certainly be of value “ to us to have the line from Bagdad via kerman- “ shah, Ispahan, Kerman, on to the Indian frontier, . , ’ .1 Whpn the Euphrates Views of Sir H.

Bracken bury, 2nd October 1890. Pol. 929/90. To the line from Quetta to Seistan Sir H. Brackenbury was opposed, because its construction “ would be a direct incentive to Russia to push “ forward railways into Khorasan. It would “ strengthen the hands of the Russian military “ party, which is anxious to make such railways “ for purposes of aggrandisement, against the “ Finance Minister, who, from motives of economy, “ as pointed out by Sir R. Morier in his Despatch “ of the 13th November 1869. desires to prevent “ their being made, and any possible advantage- ‘‘ that our Indian trade might derive from it would, “ in my opinion, be far more than counterbalam e “ by the advance of Russian railways, which would “ hasten on that evil day when, with an advanced “ and improved base of operations, Russia &gt; . be “ in a position to threaten our Indian frontier/ * • * * Minute of Sir H. Brackenbury, 8th October 1889. (P. 6.) * It should bo mentioned, as regards Sir H. Brackenbury’s views, that in a note written bv him as M.litary Member in India, on the 27th April 1891, he explained that he had only objected to a Seistan Railway so long as the Russians did not extend their railways south of the 1 rans- Caspian line: vide paragraph 25 of Lord Curzon’s Minute, printed as Appendix I. “ The safety ot our Indian Empire from any “ attack by Russia lies iu the distance which “ separates the Russian base on the Trans-t 'aspian “ Railway from the Indian frontier, combined with »- “ the difficulties of supply and transport throughout “ that distance which render it impossible tor large “ forces to be employed against India. Every mile “ of railway which Russia uiakes southward into “ Khorasan or along the Perso-Afghan frontier “ diminishes pro tanto those difficulties. “ Convinced that all idea of an invasion of “ India by Russia from her present base may be “ safely dismissed, I am equally convinced that “ at some future day, when Khurasan and Northern “ Afghanistan have been pierced by Russian “ railways anti turned into granaries for Russian “ armies, unless an unforeseen convulsion has “ broken up the Russian Empire, Great Britain “ will be confronted with this fearfully difficult “ problem -how to defend her Indian frontiers “ against the masses which Russia will then be “ able to employ. Commercially, every rood of “ Eastern ground that comes under Russian “ influence is so much lost to British trade; and 1 “ hold, therefore, that it is little short of treason to “ every interest of our Empire to connive at, or “ assist in any way, the promotion of Russian “ railways in the north of Persia.” Sir 11. Brackenbury denied the strategic im portance of the Quetta-Seistan railway, and also questioned the prospect of its commercial success :— “ The greater part of the line would pass through a “ desert, and it could not possibly pay cornmer- “ cially unless Seistan were greatly developed.”^ b aAt the close of the controversy, Lord Salisbury recorded the following minute : — “ if Russia makes her railway through Khorasan, “ the north of Persia is hopelessly lost. W ill the “ south of Persia--the region which stretches south “ of the desert, and includes Sinister, Ispahan, “ and Seistan—be lost also ? “ The answer to that question largely depends “ on some such line as that under consideration. “ Xf it is not made, Southern Persia must fall too “ Afghanistan so embraced, must be indefensible “ the advanced Russian posts will be on the “ Helm and. I should, however, myself, prefer a “ railway to Seistati from the sea.’' 13. No such railway as that suggested by Lord Salisbury was proceeded with, nor were railways m Persia generally any more discussed during the next few years. Mention may, however, be made at this point of a suggestion brought forward orally by the Russian Government in LSDS lor the joining of their Merv-Kushk Pailway to the Indian svstem by a line passing, not through Persia, but through Afghanistan The suggestion was made to Sir N. O’Conor who had previously enquired of the Russian Goveinment ns to da truth of a report that material was stored at Kushk for the extension oi the Russian railway, in case of necessity, to Herat. The report was admitted to be true, and it was not denied that the Merv- Kushk Railway existed solely for strategic reasons. The Indian railways—observed M Witte—had been pushed on to the Afghan frontier for much the same reasons, but by the linking of the Russian and Indian systems the mutual commercial interests of the tw r o countries would be so closely knit “ that an aggressive policy on the part oi either “ country would be rendered well-nigh impossible.” He further said that “the railway, being a com- k ‘ mercial project, it ought to be stipulated that “ it should not be used for the transport of troops.” Sir N. O’Conor rejoined that it wamld probably be extremely difficult to obtain the consent of the Amir of Afghanistan to the suggested railway, and that, since the railway would be constructed with British capital, and we had also a political Protec torate over Afghanistan, there would be insuperable objections to any stipulation forbidding the transport ot British troops over the railway :—“ Such a stipu- “ lation would be tantamount to allowing Russian “ troops to be moved freely almost to the gates of “ Herat, while Her Majesty’s forces were kept at the “ other extremity of the country under their Pro- “ tectorate.” 1 he Ambassador also questioned M. Witte as to tariffs on the Caucasian line, and observed that, if he imposed prohibitive import duties or heavy transit dues, all commercial advan tage to us would be lost. M. Witte admitted this, and said that, of course, there were many points of this kind that would have to be studied and worked out. Pol. 929/90.

These rumours need not presumably be treated very seriously. The Russian proposal was not followed up, and indeed it may be said of all proposals for railways through Afghanistan that they have been mentioned only to be excluded for the reason referred to in the present case, viz., the diiliculty of securing the Amir’s consent. There is not only himself, but his subjects, to be reckoned with.' ::: ‘ Renewal of rumours as to Rus sian Railway projects in Persia. M. Rittich’s pamphlet. Sir C. Scott 8 DeKpatch No. 93, 4th April 1900. (P. 13.) Sir C. Scott’s Despatch No. 93. 4th April 1900. Sir C. Scott’s Despatch No. 116, 2nd May 1900. (Pp. 12 and 39.) 14. About the end of the 10 years’ period for which the Russian Agreement of 1890 was to be in force, there was a renewal of rumours as to Uussian radway projects in Persia, and the activity of Russian engineers in different parts of the country. The anxiety of Russia may, perhaps, be in part explained by the fact, reported in a despatch from the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, that “ M. Witte was much disturbed by the grant of the “ concession to Germany for the Constantinople- “ Bagdad line, and by the idea of this line “ being possibly connected through Persian ter- “ ritory with Indian railways, and thus forming “ a direct trade route to Asia, which would seriously “ injure the prospects of the Trans-Siberian and “ other projected Russian lines. The Ambassador also sent home about this time a summary of a Chauvinistic pamphlet on “Railways m Persia’ by a Russian officer (M. Rittich), who described Great Britain, then involved in South Africa, as the “ Modern Carthage,” and declared that Russia should push forward lines from Tabriz through Tehran to Bunder Abbas, with a branch from Tehran to Kushk. He also indicated two Russian lines through Afghanistan, one from Kushk to Kandahar r/d Herat, and the other from Chardjui to Peshawar passing to the north-east of Kabul. “ The defence of India,” he wrote, “ on the side of “ Baluchistan is weak, and acting on this side we “ may achieve the highest results. Every plan for “ the defence of India is centralised in the north, “ where two-thirds of the whole army are con- “ centrated, where the passes are very difficult and “ the fortifications powerful. Leaving the Turkes- “ tan army on the Hank of Afghanistan, in order to “ make a demonstration and for active operations, “ we can throw the other Turkestan and Caucasian “ armies into Seistan, Baluchistan, and Central ‘ India. There will be no impediment and no “ opposition to our forces. The English railway “ across Nushki will be useful to us for the “ conveyance of stores, and if the English connect “ it with Meshed, we shall have a direct line “ of communications with the Caucasus and “ Turkestan.” In commenting on this pamphlet, Mr. C. (now Lord) llardinge observed The strategical con- “ si derations put forward by the author are of no “ great value, since it is evident that, so long as the British fleet is able to command the Persian “ Gulf, an advance on India through Seistan and “ Baluchistan would be exposed to a flank attack “by a British force acting from the south upon B 3 %.'y» ; »p.v«L •' ' ' * + ' - •«;-» ^ * •' r £■ I 14 the Russian line of communications at a great distance from the Russian base. The warlike “ Bakhtiari and Kashgai tribes and the Lurs of Luristan would under such circumstances become “ important factors in the struggle.” 15. Some three years later Mr. (now Sir C.) Spring-Rice, Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, commu nicated further information regarding M. Rittich, who had, it appeared, been specially sent to Persia and Persian Baluchistan in 1900 by the Russian Government to investigate as to railways, and economic, political and military conditions. The information included two lengthy confidential reports from that officer, and their gist may be gathered from the following extracts from Mr. Spring-Rice’s despatch:— “4. The various routes to the south have been subjected to a close examination. The Russian ‘ report strongly recommends the route via Yezd Kerman, Bam, to Charbar, outside the Persian “ Gulf, and giving direct access to the ocean. This route is recommended in consequence of the “ great difficulties attending the construction of a line to Bunder Abbas or Bushire, the naval predominance of England on the Gull, and the “ alleged unsuitableness of these ports for a naval “ station. It is suggested that a branch should be “ constructed from Bam to Seistan, which ‘ un- “ ‘ doubtedly might serve as a place d'armea for a “ ‘ movement on Kandahar, and through Nushki to “‘Quetta.’ The writer adds that ‘the English have already facilitated our operations in this “ ‘ direction by constructing a caravan road and “ digging wells.’ ” “ 5. With regard to the question of the con- “ struct ion of a railroad by the English, the writer “ alludes to the experience gained by Russia in “ Manchuria, which shows with what ease and “ celerity a railway once made can be repaired, “ however complete its destruction. ‘ Erom a “ military point of view, he remarks, ‘ it would “ absolutely play into our hands.’ “ b. Colonel Napier (Military Attache at “ St. Petc'rsburg) points out that in making an “ attack upon India the main difficulty which “ Russia would have to encounter would be trans- “ port. If, therefore, Russia has a line through “ Persia to bring up her troops, as well as the “ Trans-Caspian and Orenburg-Tashkenr lines, the “ attack would be greatly facilitated “ 8 . With regard to the cost of the line from “ Trans-Caucasia via Resht and Tehran to Chakh- “ i-bahr (Charbar) the Russian report estimates “ it at 19,095,000/., allowing 1,575,000/. for the “ construction and armament of a port. The “ distance is given as 2,290 versts (1,500 miles). “ The estimate allows 8,500/. per verst . 0 it is to “ be observed that the Siberian Railway cost “ 12,285/. per verst, and the Manchurian 17,850/., Further information as to views of M. Rittich. Mr. Spring-Rice's Despatch No. 396, 23rd November 1903. (P. 184.) * One verst = -62 miles.15 Mr. Spring-Rice’s Despatch from St. Petei*sburg, No. 239, 12th May 1904. (P. 61.)

Provisions for guarding the line with “ detachments of Russian troops are also considered “ in detail. A force of about 4,000 men is “ considered sufficient. “ 10. The cost of the line and port, which even “ according to the estimate is nearly 20 , 000 , 000 ^., “ must act as an effectual deterrent for some time “ to come. “ The construction of a through railway to the Persian Gulf was a favourite scheme of M. Witte’s, “ and the removal of that Minister from ths Treasury as well as the unfortunate experience “ gained by Russia in Manchuria, will probably act as deterrents to the commencement of railway “ enterprise in Persia. “ The general ideas underlying the proposed “ scheme appear to be two:— “(1.) To facilitate an attack upon India; and “ (2.) To construct a through route by rail to “ the Indian Ocean. “ It is pointed out, however, that in the “ latter case a line through Persia to the south “ ‘ will only be profitable on condition that Russia “ ‘ has the right to impose customs duties, as in “ ‘ the contrary case this route, while facilitating “‘access for foreign goods, will injure Russian “ ‘ trade, not only in Central, but in Northern “ ‘ Persia.’ “ This, of course, implies the practical annexation “ of Persia.” The interest of M. Rittich’s writings for the purposes of this memorandum consists in their exemplification of Russian forward policy, as ex pounded by the extreme military party. It only remains to add that there were at the beginning of 1904 rumours of the lease of Charbar to Russia. The truth of the rumours was doubted, but Colonel Napier, Military Attache at St. Petersburg, re ported :—“ f rom conversations that 1 have had “ with Russian officers, I am convinced that they “ want a port outside the Persian Gulf, and I “ believe that Charbar is the particular port they “ have in view.” 16. It had previously been decided—in April 1900 to remind the Shah and the Persian Govern ment of the late Shah’s autograph promise to the British Government as to railways in Persia (see paragraph 5). 17. To return to the project for a Quetta-Seistan Railway, the discussion of which was brought to an end, as mentioned in paragraph 11 , by the “steril ising” Agreement of 1890. The discussion was resumed some 10 years later, when the whole question of British policy was under consideration and “ the strategic importance of Seistan was once more emphasised, as well as the dangers to be appre-headed from the advanee of Russia to the Persian Gulf. In a minute by the Viceroy (Lord Curzon), dated the 4th September 1899, enclosed in Foreign Department letter (Secret), of the Government of India, No. 175, 21st September 1899,* the question of Seistan was fully dealt with, and its importance, economically and strategically, summed up in the following words : — “ 12. It will be seen from what I have written “ that Seistan is, by virtue of its position and its “ features, an object of much interest both to Russia “ and Great Britain Situated at the point of “ junction of the frontiers of Persia, Afghanistan, “ and Baluchistan, its future affects the destinies of “ all three countries. Lying, as it does, almost “ midway between Meshed and the Persian Gulf, “ no advance can be made from Khorassan to the “ sea except through Seistan. Its position upon “ the exposed flank of Afghanistan would render “ its occupation of great value to any Power con- “ tern plating either a move against that country or “ an advance upon Kandahar. Nor will it be “ denied that the Kandahar-1 lerat line could not be “ held with safety by India, nor the Valley of the “ Helmand defended, were a hostile Power in “ possession of Seistan. Furthermore, the grain- “ producing capabilities of the district, to the “ bygone richness of which eloquent testimony is “ borne by the immense number of ruined cities “ encumbering the soil, and which could, without “ serious difficulty, be revived by a scientific “ employment of the waters of the Helmand, render “ Seistan of much value, as a possible granary, “ either to a Power engaged upon a forward “ advance or to a Power interested in commercial “ and industrial expansion.” In the same minute the, project was discussed of railway connection between Quetta and Seistan, and the controversy reviewed that had taken place between Sir II 1). Wolff and Sir 11. Brackenbury on that subject. The conclusion arrived at was that a Quetta-Seistan Railway was rightly condemned if it was only intended as an offensive and strategical scheme ; its real object, however, was something different, viz., to save Southern Persia from falling into the grasp of Russia. It was, properly speaking, a protective, not an offensive, measure, but Lord Curzon considered that lor the time being, especially if we could come to an agreement with Russia, it woidd be better to postpone consideration of the scheme, though, except with regard to water, it offered no engineering difliculties.

Pol. 1376(a)/01. of the Government of India of the 7th November 1001 , in which attention was drawn to the dis tinction between “commercial pleas and political ambitions,” and the view was expressed that, if only the object of Russia were commercial, there was no reason why she should not establish railway con nection across Persia, from north to south, with the Persian Gulf. “ The argument ” so ran the minute (paragraph 2) —“ that Russia can safely be “ permitted to secure a maritime outlet for herself in the Persian Gulf, and that it is desirable that Great Britain should assist, or at least not with- “ stand, her in that consummation rests upon a “ fundamental confusion of ideas. Those who “ employ it fail altogether to discriminate between “ commercial pleas and political ambitions. It may be urged that, whereas Russian manufacturers in their attempt to gain access to the K as tern “ markets, are at present compelled to make the “ long and circuitous journey by the Black Sea, “ the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Red “ Sea, before they can reach the Indian Ocean, it “ would be an advantage could they be transported “ by railroads either from the &lt; ’aueasus, or from the “Caspian, to the Persian Gulf; although the “ apparent value of such a gain would probably be “ a good deal discounted in practice by the com- “ paratively limited trade of Russia (which, however, “ may admit of a considerable development in the “ future), still more by the superior cost of land “ carriage over sea carriage. In so far as these are “ the ambitions of Russia, it is not probable that “ any one would seriously resist cheir satisfaction. “ They can be accomplished —provided the money “ be forthcoming - by amicable arrangements with “ Persia and with Great Britain. 1 am not, myself. “ a believer in the paying capacities of a Trans- “ Persian line for many years to come. T he country “ itself is poor, and cannot furnish either the capital “ or the traffic. Were the line, however, an open “ line, it might conceivably attract the Russian “ trade from one end, and the Indian trade from “ the other, which w'ould enable it to subsist. It “ is also conceivable that capitalists might be willing “ to come forward and construct it -though were “la capitalist, I should not be found among “ their number and arrangements might be made “ by which, while the line remained Persian “ property, the construction and maintenance of “ the northern portion might be entrusted to Russia, “ and those of the southern portion to Great Britain, “ a joint guarantee of the three Governments being “ applied to the whole. The railway might termi- “ nate on the Gulf in a Persian port, open to the “ commerce of all nations, but subject to the import “ and export dues prescribed by the Persian tariff. “ I should, myself, regard such a venture as pre- “ mature and as speculative in the highest degree, “ but I do not see anything in it that need neces- “ sarily arouse political jealousy or international “ complications.18 Lord Curzon went on to explain that, what Russia really desired, was not a commercial rail way, but one “ built exclusively by Russian capital, “ managed and officered entirely by Russian agents, “ constructed not for commercial but for political “ and strategical objects, and terminating in a “ Russian, as distinct from a Persian, port, that “ would presently be converted not merely into a “ coaling station, but into a fortified naval base on “ the Indian Ocean.” The remainder of the minute dwelt on the serious commercial, political, and strategical consequences that would follow from the establishment of Russia in such a commanding position. British trade would be extinguished, and the possession of Seistan which would be conferred by a Russian railway would enable Russia to menace the entire western flank of Afghanistan, and exercise on the tribes of Baluchistan and Mekran a disturbing and anti-British influence. There would be similar objections to a Russian “ political ” railway terminating at any port of the Persian Gulf, whether Mohammerah, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, or Charbar. (Paragraphs \ 2 to end of the minute are printed as Appendix 11.) The discussion of policy closed with the com munication to the Shah of Lord Lansdowne’s Despatch No. 2, dated the 6 th January 1902, to the British Minister at Tehran, from which the following is an extract : — “ As regards railways, 1 may remind you that “ in March 1889 the late Shah of Persia gave a “ distinct promise in writing that Great Britain “ should have priority in the construction of a “ southern railway to Tehran ; that if concessions “ for railways were given to others in the north a “ similar concession should be granted to an “ English Company in the south; and that no “ southern railway concession should be granted “ to any foreign Company without consultation “ with the British Government. This pledge was “ brought to the notice of the present Shah in April “ 1900,and was acknowledged by His Majesty to be “ of continued and binding validity. “ As regards Seistan, I have quite recently, in “ my Despatch of the 9th July 1901, directed you “ to call the attention of the Persian Government to the interest which this district has for Great “ Britain on account of its proximity to India and “ its position on an important trade route between “ India and Persia, and to state that we regard it “ as of the utmost importance that it should remain “ free from the intrusion of foreign authority in any “ shape.” Lord Lansdowne's Despatch No. 2, 6th January 1902.

In the following year, on the 5th May, Lord Lansdowne made in the I louse of Lords the decla rationthat “ we should regard the establishment of “ a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian “ Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace “ to British interests, and we should certainly resist “ it with all the means at our disposal.” lie added Lord Lansdowne’s Declaration of 5th May 1903. * Parliamentary Debates, Fourth Sexies, Vol. 121, pp. 1348 and 1350.19 Lord Lansdowne s Despatch No. 112, 6th May 1903. (P. 130.) later in the speech, as regards railways: “ The “ position in which we stand is this, that, whenever “ railway construction takes place in Persia, we have a right to construct, or procure the con struction of railways in the southern part of that “ country. Persia will then be opened, not only “ to the capital and enterprise of other countries, but to the capital and enterprise of this country “ as well ; and, though that arrangement may not be recorded in any very formal manner, we are | satisfied that it is a binding engagement on the ‘‘ part of the Persian Government, and we should “ certainly maintain that that is its character. “ Closely connected with the subject of railways is “ the subject of roads,” &amp;c. In the course of a conversation with the Russian Ambassador on the subject of this declaration, Lord Lansdowne observed : — W e m this country recognised the prepon- “ derance of Russia in north Persia. On the other “ hand we had special interests in the Gulf, in the “ south ports, and also in Seistau. With regard to the latter we should certainly regard with serious “ apprehension any attempt on the part of Russia “ to construct a railway from the north so as to “ threaten the frontiers of India on the Baluchistan Renewal of the Russian Railway Agreement of 1890.

The Russian Railway Agreement of 1890, as explained in paragraph 10 , was intended to run for 10 years. Towards the end of that time there was much uncertainty for what period the Agreement had been renewed, but in December 1904 Sir A. Hardinge forwarded from Tehran, together with an authentic copy of the 1890 Agreement, a Memo randum* communicated by Count Mouravieff to the Persian Minister at St. Petersburg in 1899, in which it was laid down as one of tliree conditions of the Russian loan, which was granted in the following year, that “ the Persian Government will renew “ the previous engagement and undertake that, for “ another 10 years, excepting the Russian Govern- “ ment, no other Government will be given a con- “ cession to build railways in Persia.” To the Memorandum was appended an autograph order of the Shah to the Sadr Azam, in which it was said : “ 1 have agreed to the three conditions.” In a later Despatch, however, Sir A. Hardinge reported that the question of the term for which the Agree ment had been rendered was still not altogether free from doubt, since the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had declared his belief that the term of renewal by the Shah had been five, not ten years. Ultimately, it was ascertained that the period of the Agreement in fact expired in 1910. Some remarks may here be quoted of Sir A Hardinge, in a report written by him in December 1905, on relinquishing the post of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran :— “From our own point of view, we need not, 1 “ think, be eager to hasten the advent of the c 2“ railway era in Persia. Different views will, no “ doubt, be taken of this question, according as we “ assign the chief importance to commercial or to “ military considerations. • The opening of Persia “ to railways would undoubtedly be most advan- “ tageous to our trade, and might enable us to “ recapture many markets in the northern and “ central parts of the country, from which we have “ been driven by Russia, or in which we are feebly “ struggling to compete with her. On the other “ hand, it would mean sooner or later the linking up of the Russian and Indian railway systems, “ and, even without that, it would give Russia a “ very great advantage in any offensive operations “ which she might undertake against us or against “ Afghanistan, through Persia.” 21. With the signature, on the .‘list August 1907, of the Anglo-Russian Convention embodying an “Arrangement concerning Persia” (Appendix 111.), the question oi railways in Persia entered upon a new phase. \\ ith regard to Article 111 ot the Arrangement, enquiry was made by the Government of India as to its effect on the pledges concerning railways in Southern Persia given by former Shahs on the 16th September 1888 (paragraph 5), and the 11th April 1900 (paragraph 16) The reply elicited from the Foreign Otlice was to the following effect:— “ The Arrangement would clearly prevent His “ Majesty’s Covernment from constructing a rail- “ way line as far as Tehran, but, in Sir P. Greys “ opinion, the wording of the pledge given by “ Nasr-ed-Din Shah in 1888 would justify them in “ asking to be allowed to construct a line in “ Southern Persia, should they desire to do so, “ in the event of the Russian Government obtaining “ a concession to construct one in the north. “ The Government of India will doubtless not “ overlook the fact that the Russian Government “ have undertaken, by the new Arrangement, not “ to oppose concessions supported by His Majesty s “ Government in the British sphere, nor, without “previous discussion with His Majesty’s Govern- “ ment, in the neutral zone either, and that the “ position of Great Britain is therefore stronger in “ this respect at present than it was before the “ signature of the Convention.” This letter was followed by another, dated the 25th September, in which the Foreign Otlioe laid stress, in connection with the Anglo-Russian Con vention, on the desirability of considering the question of railway construction in Persia, and, in particular, whether a British concession would be advantageous for a railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz, with possible continuation to Ahwaz, and a junction with the Bagdad Railway. 22. In the year following the Convention Mr. Rees, M.P., forwarded to the Foreign Office a memorandum urging the advancement of British interests in Southern Persia, and mentioning, Anglo-Russian Convention of 31st August 1907.

In a letter to the boreign Office the India Office remarked that the points raised had been covered by the inquiries of the Persian Sub-Committee of the (Committee of Imperial Defence.t Mr. Marling also forwarded from Tehran a note by Mr. Loraine, commenting on the same memorandum, and expressing a strong preference for railways rather than roads Incidentally Mr. Loraine observed :—“ It is hardly doubtful that “ the line from Mohammerah to Tehran md the Diz “ Valley is of primary importance. It is apparently “ the line of least resistance from the seaboard “ to the Iranian plateau ; it is the shortest route, it “ traverses good country, it debouches at what is, “ for the Persian Gulf, a good port, and not an open “ roadstead like Bushire. 23. In replying to Mr. Mailing’s despatch, Sir L. Grey wrote as follows, describing what had taken place during the King’s visit to the Lmperor of Russia at Reval: — “Sir 0. Hardinge informed M. Isvolsky on that occasion that His Majesty’s Government “ would approve of a line passing through Persia “ and ending in the Gulf at Mohammerah, and “ pointed out the advantages of this route from a “ Russian point of view. “ His Excellency studied the proposed route on “ the map with evident interest, and observed that, “ although it would have the undoubted advantage “ of neutralising the Bagdad Railway, he feared “ that it would be economically disadvantageous to “ Russia, as it would facilitate the competition of “ foreign seaborne trade with that of Russian “ goods brought by rail. “ Sir C. Hardinge having observed that such “ would be the effect of all railways whithersoever “ they might lead, his Excellency said that the “ matter was one which would require careful “ study, and that he would inform me later of his “ views.” On the 28th July 1908 His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires reported from St. Petersburg that the Russian Government were ready to accept in principle a line from Julfa (the terminus of the Russian railway) to Mohammerah. The India Office recognised fully the political and material advantages of securing the concession for such a line, but expressed misgiving regarding the financial aspect of the question and the possible liabilities into which India might be drawn. 24. The views of the Russian Government on railways in Persia were next stated in an aidc- mcTiioive of the 15th August 1908, of which a uopy is printed as Appendix I\ . The Russian Govern ment agreed in principle to a line from Julfa to Mohammerah, and, being unable to furnish the capital themselves, were ready to settle the financial side of the question with Great Britain , the} also c 39o wished to arrange simultaneously the question of a r n ® x, ? r n i al Persian loan. They proposed that the Ju fa-Mohammerah line should be joined with lehran and, further, that Tehran should be linked up with Resht and Enzeli. The necessity of constructing a line from Askhahad to Meshed' had also to be considered. In order to preserve Russian commercial interests in the north, it would pro- . a . ^ necessary to examine the question of treight rates on the Moharnmerah line. As a basis f 01 ^ 11 interchange of views, a copy was annexed to the Memorandum of a confidential letter from F &lt; A ' - ^ oltf to M de Staal, dated London, the the 20th January 1900. in which the former had advocated as part of an evte??te between Great J hi tain and Hussia a line from Enzeli to Moham- nierah, with certain transit dues, levied at each end, as security lor a loan to be guaranteed by Russia Great Britain, and Persia. 25. The views of the India Office on the Russian (tide-meiwfire were asked for in a letter from the roreign Ollice dated the 17th September 11)08 In reply it was explained that, in Urd Worley’s opinion, the paramount difficulty was that of tinauce and that the Indian Exchequer wonld be unable to provide funds for any scheme of railway construction way 618111 le ettel C0IM ' 1 ' lle&lt;i in the following &lt;( .“ 7 - J here is the further difficulty to be con- fe' fy , 111 conuec t&gt;on with the railway question _ that It has not yet been ascertained for certain that the construction of the proposed line (i.e„ „ -'tehiiminerah Julia) is practicable from the .. ^'giHeering point of view.

Isvolsky on the 14th idem, of which the text is printed as Appendix V. In this it was explained that His Majesty’s Government had con templated not the actual construction of railways, but rather the ear-marking of concessions, and- apart from the uncertainty of the political situation- attention was drawn to the absence of surveys, the doubt as to the ultimate constitution of the Bagdad Railway Company, and the doubt as to the con struction of a branch line from Bagdad to Khanikin as factors which, in the opinion of liis Majesty’s Government, rendered impracticable in existing circumstances any definite scheme of railway development in Persia. A railway from Julia to Mohammerah could not therefore be built with adequate prospects of commercial success, and His Majesty’s Government would not feel justified in guaranteeing a minimum rate of interest for railways in Persia. 1 he finances of Persia should be set in order before such railways were constructed, but vjifdt I &gt;1 itain and Russia would be fully justified “ i n informing the Persian Government that, in the ‘‘ event of railway communications being established ‘ m Persia, they would expect to have the refusal, “ npon terms equally favourable to any offered by thud paities, of all concessions which might be “ ^ contemplation.” Besides the southern section of a Julfa-Mohaminerah line, the concessions most closely concerning His Majesty’s Government were for lines from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz, with option loi a port at Khor Musa. It would be well nigh impossible for Great Britain to assent to anything like a discrimination of tariff rates in favour of Russian goods on the Mohammerah railway. A hope was expressed that the Askhabad-Meshed project might remain in abeyance. Views of Sir G. Barclay on the Russian Aide-Memoire. Sir (1. Barclay’s Despatch No. 288, 4th November 1908. ' (P. 132.) Pol. 4161/08. 2i. After the Russian aide-memoire had been answered, a despatch was received from Sir G. Barclay, dated the 4th November 1908, which specially dealt with the question of differential rates on the Mohammerah-Julfa line : — “1 do not know whether any decision has “ been taken as regards the alignment of the pro- “ posed railway, but I presume that it will pass “ through Tabreez, Kazvin, Hamadan, Burujird, “ Khoremabad, Dizfuh Shuster, and Ahwaz. Our “ existing commercial interests, which would be “ directly affected by such a line, lie almost “ entirely within the Russian zone. Our trade, which now passes from the head of the Persian “ Gulf through Bagdad and Khanikin to Kerman- “ shah and Hamadan, shows an increase during the c 424 “ last four years of from 700,COOL to 1,092,000/. “ Besides this, British goods to the value of about “ 150,000/. enter the Russian zone by Trebizond to “ Tabriz. Both these branches of British trade “ would evidently be diverted to the Mohammerah- “ Julia railway when built, and both, if given a “ fair chance, would then doubtless show consider- “ able development; but, if the principle of differ- “ ential treatment throughout the Russian zone is “ admitted, they are sure to be handicapped out of “ existence, which will be all the easier when “ Vladikavkas is linked up with Tifhs, and through “ traffic established from the districts north of “ the Caucasus. “ Against this we might, 1 presume, count on “ an increase of trade in the neutral zone, resulting “ as time goes on from the development of the “ regions through which the line passes, but, “ though some of these possess no doubt great “ potential wealth, their development seems at pre- “ sent very remote. They are thinly populated, “ and a great part of the line will run through the “ most lawless districts in Persia. In any case we “ already monopolize such trade as there is in these “ parts, and our only gain would accrue from the “ expansion of trade already in our hands. In u short, we should gain nothing at Russia’s expense, “ whereas she would gain much at ours. On the “ other hand, it must be admitted that a railway “ from Mohammerah to Julia, run on the purely “‘open-door’ principle, would probably result in “ disaster for Russian vested interests. Possibly a “ workable arrangement might be devised by which “ the differential tariff could be restricted to the “ regions north of those fed from Kermanshah and “ Ramadan.” Sir G. Barclay also dwelt on the advantage of mil- ways to Persia herself, since “ their existence would “ put a powerful weapon in the hands of the Central “Government . . . in regions where their a nth o- “ rity is to-day a mere shadow, and can be set at “ nought with impunity.” lie further touched on the question of the effect of a railway through his coun try on the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. 28. In another despatch of the same date Sir G. Barclay represented the desirability urged by Major Cox, of the examination by a reconnoitring party of the country between Dizful and Khoremabad, as a necessary preliminary of its opening up by road or railway.“It would of course greatly injure our “ commercial prospects if, for instance, Ramadan “ were connected by rail with Julfa, while the “ Mohammerah section was still en Vair at “ Dizful.” 29. In the autumn of 1909 a proposal was laid before the India Office, recommended by the Indo- European Telegraph Company, by certain gentle men, including Sir F. Mowattand Mr. 11. F. B.

I hey expressed a preference for a cart road that might be converted into a railway, and remarked that the right to police the road in some form would presumably be included in the concession, hey added that they could only contemplate the pioject if His Majesty’s Government were satisfied that a corresponding movement on the part of Russia towards Meshed would not be the conse quence Lord Morley, in forwarding the telegram reminded the Foreign Office of the views he had already expressed as to an Askhabad-Meshed lino (paragraph 25 end), and the Foreign Office in icply undertook to repeat their request to the Russian (lovernment that a line should not be built from Askhabad to Meshed; they further pointed out that financial considerations would probably exclude it. Sir A. Nicolson, it may be added, shortly afterwards expressed doubt whether an Askhabad-Meshed line would be likely to be enter tained by Russia as a serious project for some time to come, and he did not think that a cart road from Bunder Abbas to Kerman would awaken any anxiety in Russia. Sir G. Barclay concurred in the view that the project of a Bunder Abbas-Kerman road merited in principle the support of His Majesty’s Government, hut held out no very confident hope that the Medjliss would grant a concession, and added that the country was too unsafe to allow a survey to be undertaken without a strong escort. After consulting the India Office, the Foreign Office infoimed Mr. Stratford Andrews, who was acting on behalf of the gentlemen named, that their request was being carefully considered, but that the Persian Government were in no position at the moment to supply the escort that would be necessary. Prof osed examination by Lieutenant Wilson of a connection between Bushire and the Bunder Abb ^s-Shiraz route. LetU r of India Office to Foreign Office, 28th Oct &gt;ber 1909. (P. 58.) Pol. 1388/09. 30. A short time previously the India Office had asked the views of the Foreign Office as to a proposal of the Government of India that Lieu tenant A. T. Wilson, after leaving Mohammerah, should be retained in Persia, at the joint charge of the British and Indian exchequers, in order to examine the question of affecting a connection between Bushire and some point on the Jahrum- S. 47. nAliabad-Firuzabad section of the Bunder Abbas- Lar-Jahrum-Shiraz route. It was observed in their letter that the question oi communications between Bushire and Shiraz had been touched upon in the evidencebefore the Sub-C omuiittee oi Imperial Defence. After some correspondence the 1 reasury agreed to share equally the expenditure involved, viz., Rs. 2,000 (133J. 6s. 8 d.) for contingent expenses, and Us. 753 annas 12 a month (6031. a year) for Lieutenant Wilson’s salary, and the Secretary ol State informed the (loverument oi India that their proposal had been sanctioned. Lieutenant Wilson, it may here be explained, had before tins prepared a memorandum, dated the 10 th August 1907, on a proposed railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. The following extract from the memorandum may be of interest:— “ The general considerations governing the “ construction of a line from Bunder Abbas to “ Shiraz are touched on by Lord Curzon in his book “ 1 Persia and the Persian Question,’ Vol. L, pages “ 029-636. At page 636 the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz “ line is actually mentioned. “ Bunder Abbas is even now a fairly good “ harbour, and could easily be greatly improved. “ R i tf the port to which all goods lor Kerman and the districts served from it are consigned. “ Lor this reason a Bunder Abbas-Kerman “ railway via Bam has been exhaustively discussed by the Government of India in a Secret Memo- “ random, which is probably available in the India “ Ollice.t Such a line would no doubt attract a “ large trade of bulk goods, and also of pilgrims ; “ the physical difficulties are, however, considerable. “ Bushire now attracts the whole import and “ export trade of districts served by Shiraz, and “ also to a large extent Ispahan and \ ezd. Pilgrims “ are also a great feature of the port. “ A line bringing Shiraz within twenty-four “ hours oi Bunder Abbas would certainly absorb “ the greater part of the traffic now carried on by “ caravan. Lingah likewise lias a growing import “ and export trade with the interior, Lar being an “ important mart only six days’ march from Lingah, “ as against about ten days from Bunder Abbas. “ A line serving Lar would attract almost all this “ traffic. “It is clear, there lore, that there is a large “ bulk of goods, both import and export, which “ would be consigned by rail between the sea coast “ and the interior. J Assuming Shiraz to be the “ northern end of the line, where could the southem “end join the sea? At Bushire? No. . The “ physical difficulties involved by the crossing of “ lofty mountain chains separated by deep valleys “ are insuperable, although a better cavavan track “ v id Firuzabad is available as a substitute for the “ difficult route now in use. The greater length, “ however, of the latterjireveuts its adoption. At * Questions 517, 556, 937, ami 1130. Letter of Treasury to Foreign Office, 20th December 1909. (P. 182.) Pol. 4388/09.

Towards the end of the year 1909 corre spondence was resumed as to the general question of railway construction in Persia in a letter addressed by the Foreign Office to this Office, enclosing copies of despatches from Sir G. Barclay ( 8 th November) and Sir A. Nicolson (1st December). Sir G. Barclay, after personal consultation with Major Cox, concurred in the view that had been expressed in a Foreign Office memorandum of the 29th September 1908, written while our reply to the Russian aide-memoire was under consideration, as to the disastrous effect upon British trade in Persia of a Julfa-Mohammerah railway on the lines proposed by the Russian Government, and he emphasised the need for simultaneous construction of the railway from north and south, and for the exclusion of differ ential rates. He accepted the list of the lines mentioned to the Russian Government as those of special importance to British interests, with the addition of the link to join Bushire via Aliabad with the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line. Sir A. Nicolson’s despatch reported a conversation in which M. Isvolsky had mentioned the visit to London of the Duma deputies and their desire that through communication with India should be established. This would, M. Isvolsky thought, serve as a set-off to any detriment or risks which Russian interests might suffer by the construction of the Bagdad Railway, but he knew that it was yet too early for the project to be realised. In their letter the Foreign Office expressed general concurrence in the views of Sir G. Barclay and Major Cox, but considered that it would be better not to await a settlement with the Russian Government as to the Moh am me rah-J ulfa line before making a demand on the Persian Govern ment for preferential rights to construct the Mohammerah-Julfa and other lines. Their letter continued as follows :— “ Turning now to Sir A Nicolson’s despatch “ Lord Morley will observe that M. Isvolsky is D 228 “ especially anxious that His Majesty’s Government “should not refuse to consider the question of “ joining the Russian and Indian railway “ systems. “ As regards this question, Sir E. Grey fully “ recognises that, though this junction will doubt- “ less be effected at some future date, the moment “ is still remote when such an enterprise could be “ carried into effect. He would, however, submit, “ for Lord Morley’s consideration, that the remote- “ ness of the time when the project can be realised “ affords no adequate reason for refusing to demand “ from the Persian Government at once the pre- “ ferential right to construct the line when it may “ suit His Majesty’s Government to link up the “ Indian railway system with those of Persia and “ Europe by a line from Nushki to Kerman, “ Tehran, and Julfa. Such a demand in no way “ implies any obligation or intention to begin the “ construction of the line immediately, while “ neglect to take this opportunity of making it “ might be punished by the grant of a similar “ privilege to a third Power, which might, for “ example, secure permission to build a line from “ Tehran to the south, with branches to Seistan “ and elsewhere. It is clear that the construction “ in Persia of lines in which Great Britain had no “ part would be far more detrimental to British “ interests than their construction with the parti- “ cipation and under the partial control of His “ Majesty’s Government. “ There is at the same time no fear that the “ Russian Government would themselves imme- “ diately begin the construction of the line of “ junction, since, as was admitted in M. isvolsky s “ memorandum of the 15th August 1908, they have “ no funds available for such a purpose. “ An additional reason for pressing this demand is to be found in the obvious anxiety of M. Isvol sky that the question should not be treated as outside the range of practical politics. I he concession to His Excellency s wishes involved in admitting it to consideration would, as clearly appears from His Excellency’s observations to Sir A. Nicolson, go far to reconcile him and public opinion in Russia generally to British participation in the construction of the Bagdad Railway, which is a matter of the highest importance. “ It is therefore in Sir E. Grey’s opinion essen tial, from a political point of view, that this demand should be made without delay, while from a commercial standpoint there would appear to be no objection to the line which, if con structed, would help Indian trade to compete with Russian. “ To resume, Sir E. Grey would suggest that, ; as a first step, the two Powers should, when the Persian Government approaches them with a [ request for pecuniary assistance, make it a con- 1 dition of their consent to an advance that the29 preferential right as against other Powers to “ construct certain railways should be reserved “ to them, that these railways should include “ one from Julfa to Mohainmerah by way of “ Tehran, and one connecting the Caucasian rail ways with the Indian system by way of Tehran, Kerman, and Nushki, and that His Majesty’s “ Government, for their part, should also demand “ the right to construct lines from— “ 1. Bunder Abbas to Kerman ; “ 2. Bunder Abbas to Ahwaz by way of Shiraz, “ with the option of building a port at “ Khor Musa ; and “3.

In reply the India Office dwelt on the disadvantage to which llis Majesty’s Government would be exposed in the negotiations if they were committed in advance to the construction of the Mohammerah-Julfa line, and, as regards the linking of the Russian and Indian Railways, on the risk of yielding to M. Isvolsky's wishes to treat the question as not outside the range of practical politics, even though the route suggested were •I ulfa-Tehran-Kerman, and not one by way of Meshed and Seistan : —“ From the point of view' “ of local political relations it (the Julfa-Tehran- “ Kerman line) is so far less objectionable than “ the other (Meshed-Seistan) that it avoids the “ eastern frontier of Afghanistan. But, strate- “ gically, the objections to it appear to be equally “ insuperable whether, after leaving Kerman, it “ proceeds via Nushki to Quetta, or, descending to “ the Gulf at Charbar, runs along the coast to “ Karachi.” As regards the other three lines, it was pointed out that the construction of lines in the south might lead to corresponding movements by Russia in the north, and doubts were cast on the probable benefit from such lines to British, or in any case Indian, trade. A preference w r as, in conclusion, expressed for * an extension of the existing “ ‘sterilising’ agreement for a further term of “ years,” which would give time for other factors, such as the fate of the Bagdad Railway, to become known. Rejoinder of Foreign Office to India Office. Letter ;&gt;f Foreign Office to India Office, 19tli January 1910. (P. 51.) Pol. 2872/10. 33. On the 19th January the Foreign Office replied at length to the arguments of this Office. They pointed out that the earmarking of the Mohammerah-Julfa line would not commit the British Government to construction work at Russia’s dictation, and that, if His Majesty’s Go vernment were to refrain from earmarking the southern portion, this would not prevent commence- D 330 ment of the northern half. Russia was unlikely, it was said, to defer railway construction in the north of Persia, whatever we might do in the south, and the argument was questioned that Indian trade would not profit by the construction of southern lines. A “ sterilising ” agreement would be im practicable and reactionary. As regards the linking up of the Russian and Indian railways, what had been feared by Sir E. Grey was that a Trans-Persian railway might be carried out by a third Power, but Sir E. Grey was now prepared to inform the Russian Government that the Government of India were unwilling to consider the question of a through railway, and to ask them not to press it. “It will not, however,” it was added, “ be possible to prevent the Russian “ Government from acquiring a concession from “ Julia via Tehran to the frontier of their sphere “ or beyond it, if they wish to do so. In Sir E. “ Grey’s opinion it would be safer for His Majesty’s “ Government to earmark a line from Yezd, or a “ point just outside the Russian sphere, to the “ frontier of India, so as to prevent another Power “ from acquiring it, or an endeavour might be made “ to obtain an undertaking from the Persian “ Government that they would give the line to no “ other Power.” 34. About the time when ibis correspondence was proceeding, proposals were being made lor the offer by Great Britain and Russia of a joint advance to the Persian Government of 4O0,OO0L The offer was made on the 18th February 1910, in a note, dated the 16th idem, and among the conditions of the advance was one as to Persian railways in the following terms: — “ 4. La Perse s’engage a ne donner aucune “ concession pour la construction de chemins de “ fer en Perse availt d’en offrir Poption aux Gouvernements de Grandr-Bretagne et de Russie. “ Ce droit d’option ne sera pas exerce dans le cas “ oil il s’agirait d’une concession a accorder a un “ subjet persan dans le but de construire et “ d’exploiter une ligne de chemin de fer avec des “ capitaux exclusivement persans, pourvu qu’il “ soit prouve a la satisfaction des Gouvernements “ de Grande-Bretagne et de Russie que ces “ capitaux sont reellement indigenes.” The note aroused the apprehensions of the German Government, and on the 17th March the Russian Ambassador communicated to the Foreign Office copy of a memorandum addressed by Germany to his Government, in which it was ob served that the reserve Germany had hither shown in Persian matters “ ne saurait aller jusqu a empecher “ toute tentative des milieux commerciaux et tinan- “ ciers allemands de chercher en Perse un terrain “ d’activite.” The German Ambassador made repre sentations to Sir E. Grey on the same subject, and, in reply, it was explained to him that the conditions Condition, in offer of Anglo-Russian Advance to Persian Government, as to Persian Railways.

As regards the conditions relating to railways, the following is an extract from a despatch addressed by Sir E. Grey to His Majesty's Ambassador in Berlin : — “ Count Metternich remarked upon our option “ upon railway concessions, saying that it seemed to exclude all foreign enterprise. “ I replied that this was not the intention of the “ condition. As a matter of fact, we had no great k ‘ desire to make railways ourselves in Persia at the “ moment, but we wished to guard against the possibility of waking up some morning to find that the Persians had placed some railway con cessions under foreign control for making railways “ where they would be damaging to our political “ interests, or strategically menacing to our fron- “ tiers. We desired, therefore, to have the option “ of making railways of this sort ourselves, and so rendering them unobjectionable, if the Persians “ decided to have them made by foreigners.” From this time onward the question of Persian railways becomes closely connected with that of the Bagdad Railway, and, therefore, also with German interests. It is not here proposed to enter fully into this larger question, it will be suflicient to refer briefly to the main issues, so far as they affect the discussion of Persian railways.

The negotiations referred to in the pre ceding paragraph for a joint Anglo-Russian advance made little progress, and the Persian Government seemed likely instead to borrow from other sources. In a Joint Anglo-Russian Note, dated the 7th April 1910, they were infonned of the conditions on which the two Governments would assent to such borrowing, and the Note concluded in the following way :— “ En outre, nous avons Phonneur de vous faire “ savoir que V \ngleterre et la Russie, tout en ne “ pas entravant les droits des nationaux d’autres “ Puissances aux enterprises purement commer- “ ciales en Perse, ne peuvent en aucun cas admettre “ qu’il soit accorde aux nationaux d’autres Puis- “ sauces etrangeres des concessions qui puissent “ porter atteinte a leurs interets politiques ou “ strategiques en Perse.” In a Note dated the 7th May 1910, the Persian Government took exception to the ambiguity of this passage and asked for an explanation of the word “concessions.” In a further Joint Note, dated the 20th May 1910, they were informed as follows : — “ Vu la difficulte de specifier les concessions “ qui pourraient porter atteinte a leurs interets “ politiques ou strategiques, les deux Puissances “ s’attendent a ce qu’avant de delivrer des con- “ cessions quelconques de voies de communication, “ de telegraphes et de ports a un sujet etranger, le “ Gouvernement persan entre dans un echange dc32 vues avec elles afin que les interets politiques ou strategiques des deux Puissances puissent etre dument sauvegardes. 'Pout acte qui se trouverait en contradiction avec ce principe serait considere comme contraire a Famitie traditionnelle qui existe si heureusement entre la Perse, la Russie, et la Grande Bretagne.” The Persian Government were urged by the British and Russian Ministers to make no reply to this further Note, but in opposition to this advice, returned a reply on the 3rd September, in which it was said that they had “ at present ” no thought of granting to foreigners the kind of concessions referred to in the Joint Note. Their reply was returned to them on the 4th September. Sir G. Barclay’s Despatch No. 169, 6th September 1910. Pol. 4023-6/10. 3f). Meanwhile, the India Otlice, in a letter dated the 9th May 1910, had replied to the Foreign Office letter of the 19th January 1910 (see para graph 33). Lord Morley accepted the view that sterilisation was not feasible, and concurred in the desirability of earmarking agreements to exclude the intervention of a third Power. He again expressed the view that India ought not to participate financially in the work of railway construction in Persia, and the letter also contained the following passage: — “As regards the line which it is understood the Russian Government are contemplating towards “ Yezd and the British frontier in Baluchistan, Lord Morley, as at present advised, agrees with the view “ in your letter that a line from that frontier, whether “ at Charbar (or Guattar) or Robat, in the direction of the Russian sphere, should be ‘ earmarked ' as “ the subject of a British concession, but he would “ suggest that the purpose in view would be suffi- “ ciently met if it stopped at Kerman, and he would “ propose that two concessions, viz., Kerman-Robat “and Kerman-Charbar (or Guattar), should be “ applied for. “It follows from the objection of the British “ Government to a junction of the Indian and “ Russian systems that they should not, in existing “ circumstances, be prepared to undertake the “ construction of the lines.” The India Office letter further enclosed copy of a telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 3 rd May 1910, which ran as follows (paraphrase):- “ Your telegram dated the 11th April* as to “ railway concessions in Persia. Securing of “ British position at the head of the Persian Gulf “ is of greatest strategical importance. The first “ step, consequently, is to get converted into a “ definite concession the option held by us for the “ southern section of the line from Julfa to Moham- “ inerah up to the southern limit of the Russian “ sphere.

On the 26th July 1910, Sir A. Nicolson reported that M. Isvolsky had mentioned to him, in conversation, the preparation of a project by M. Homyakoff, late President of the Duma, and some substantial Russian financial houses, for con necting the Indian and Russian railway systems by ivay of 1 ersia. Sir A. Nicolson having expressed doubts whether Biutish public opinion was leady for the scheme, “ M. Isvolsky observed that in Russia also there was opposition to such schemes, but chiefly in Russian commercial elides. At the same time a line traversing ‘| Persia and connecting the Russian and Indian railway systems would effectually compete with, if not kill, the Bagdad Railway.

Pol. 3990/10. + Enclosure No. I in Secretary of State’s Secret Despatch to Government of India, No. 32, 4th November 1910. 38. On the 9th August 1910, Professor Pares of Liverpool University communicated to the Foreign Office extracts from a Memorandum} drawn up by a Russian Consortium explaining in detail the scheme referred to in the foregoingparagraph : “As to direction,” it was said, “we couhl hardly expect the English to agree to the continuation “ of our line from Kushk, which would also be “ opposed by Afghanistan. The same partly “ applies to the construction of a line from Merv to “ Meshed, which would be strategically rather “ dangerous for the English.” For this and other reasons, the line proposed was one by way of Rostoff,§ Baku, Tehran, and Nushki, § On the Don, near the Sea of Azov.and the length of the journey from London to Bombay was taken as 5,156 miles (8,250 versts'--*), the time to be occupied varying from 8 days 6 hours (at 26 miles an hour) to 7 days (at 31 miles an hour). 60,000 first-class passengers were reckoned on, and 20,000 second-class, the prices of the single journey tickets from London to Bombay being 41L 6s. and 24i. 12s., respectively. Daily, instead of weekly, mails were contemplated. The cost of making the railway was estimated at about 13,500L per mile (85,000 roubles per verst), and, together with interest on capital during construction, amounted to 21,850,000L (207,000,000 roubles).! The project was described as “ a great “ economic undertaking not requiring any special “ sacrifice from the Russian Imperial Exchequer, and the enterprise was to be Anglo-1 ranco-Russian. It was calculated that the line would yield a net revenue of 1 1 , 800,000 roubles! (say 1,250,000Z.), a sum sufficient to pay 4 per cent, on ‘ an ordinary “ capital of 23,300,0001. (220,000,000 roubles), “ realised at 85,” and leave a profit of 15 per cent, on “subscribed capital,” amounting to 2,111,1111. (20,000,000 roubles). 39. Consulted by the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade pronounced the scheme to be “ of a very “ speculative character and put forward mainly in “ Russian interests.” The estimate of revenue was largely conjectural, and, while Russian trade would probably be considerably benefited “and possibly “ Indian trade also in a less degiee Uni tec Kingdom trade would probably not be benefited to any material extent, at any rate for a long time after the opening of the line, and might even suffer from the expansion of Russian trade in the interioi of Persia. The transport of passengers would pro bably form the bulk of the business of the line. While doubting whether the scheme would attract the investor, without the guarantee of a minimum return, the Board were of opinion that His Majesty’s Government might adopt “ an attitude “ of benevolent neutrality ” towards it if two con ditions were fulfilled—(1) the construction of a line from Kerman to the Gulf in which British influence should predominate; (2) the grant of “equal “ facilities for all throughout the whole railway. A memorandum by the Director of Commercial Intelligence (Mr. Worthington) accompanied the Board of Trade letter, giving statistics of Uussian trade with Persia, Uuited Kingdom trade with Persia, British India trade with Persia, and Russian trade with India. These incidentally showed that Russian trade by the Gulf is a negligible quantity, and that the bulk of British India trade is by the Gulf route ^ , .

The Despatch of the Secretary of State regarding the Trans-Persian Railway had not been long in the hands of the Government of India when news was received of an important agreement in course of negotiation between the Russian and German Governments as the result of the visit of M. Sazonow to Potsdam, providing (1) that the Bagdad Railway should not be opposed by Russia; (2) that Russia should link up Khanikin and Tehran with the Sadijah-Khanikin Railway; (3) that Germany should not build lines between the Bagdad Railway and the Persian frontier north of Khanikin* ; and (4) that Germany should recognise Russia’s special interests in the north of Persia, and not seek concessions for railways, roads, navigation, or telegraphs in the Russian sphere. The information was telegraphed to the Govern ment of India on the 30th December, and they were further informed that (according to a statement made by M. Sazonow to Sir G. Buchanan) the Russian promoters of the Trans-Persian Railway were now favouring an alignment by way of Tehran, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman, though the Russian Government themselves preferred a route from Tehran south-east to Kerman “ to avoid possible “ risk of eventual German line intersecting at “ Ispahan,” a prospect that had not been con templated by His Majesty’s Government. Provis'ons as to Russian sphere in Draft Ru iso-German Agreement. Secretary of State’s telegram to Vice roy, 141 h January 1911. Pol. 2840/11. 41. On the 14th January a further telegram was addressed to the Government of India informing them that for the purposes of the draft Russo- German Agreement the southern limit of the Russian sphere had been made to run from Kakh to the Afghan frontier at the latitude of Gazik, and that the draft Agreement had been modified in the sense that Germany would not seek concessions in the Russian sphere without first coming to an under standing with Russia. The iesult was practically to hand over the whole of the neutral section of the Afghan frontier to Russia and Germany. In reply the Government of India expressed the view that the extension of the Russian zone, in the manner above described, was an advantage rather than the reverse, inasmuch as we should have the £ 2right to demand of Russia that she should not come to an understanding against our interests. The Viceroy’s telegram concluded as follows (para phrase) :— “ It is an indisputable fact that in the rest of “ the neutral zone, Germany has the right to seek “ concessions. In order to prevent disadvantageous “ effects to our political and strategic interests in “ Southern Persia, the only course open to us is to “ remind Germany of the assurances* given by her “ to His Majesty’s Government, and when occasion “ arises to repeat to the Persian Government our “ warning^ against granting any concessions by “ which our political and strategic interests in “ Persia may be prejudiced, and to threaten, if “ necessary, that steps to safeguard our interests “ will be taken.” Viceroy's telegram, 18th January 1911.

On the 14th February 1911 a telegram was addressed to Sir G. Barclay, asking inter alia for his views on a proposal to remind the Persian Government of the Shah’s rescript of the 16th September 1888 (paragraph 5), and adding that the lines to which His Majesty’s Government attached most importance were (1) Mohammerah to Kho- remabad, with a branch at Khor Musa, and (2) Bunder Abbas to Kerman, the others in order of merit being (3) Bushire via AHabad to some point on (4) Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz. In a second telegram, dated the 2Jst February 1911, he was asked his opinion of the importance of the Mohammerah line, in relation to the rest. The Government of India also were consulted as to the general question, and especially as to the propriety of a railway guarantee to be shared with the Treasury. Sir G. Barclay was in favour of reminding the Persian Government of the Shah’s undertaking, as soon as the Regent should be firmly established, and, as regards particular lines of railway, his reply of the 27th February ran as follows (para phrase) :— “ Railways. Reference to your telegram No. 54, “ dated the 21st February. “ Of the proposed railways in Southern Persia, British trade would, I think, benefit the most by the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line. Develop ments in Bagdad Railway and in Russian railway construction in the north would, of course, determine the degree of its usefulness. A direct route would be provided to the dis trict, of which the distributing centre is Hamadan, “ from where 40 per cent, of British imports into “ Persia are distributed. This current of British trade now passes via Bagdad, and if this market “is to survive, it would appear essential, in view “ of the scheme to link up the Bagdad Railway “ with Hamadan, that the Mohammerah line should “ be constructed, unless we can be sure that the Views of Sir G.

Also, it would not seem desirable to abandon to the enterprise of third Powers the important south-west corner of “ Persia. In the event of Russia linking up her railway “ system in the north with Khoremabad and “ allowing British goods fair play, the usefulness of the line would, of course, greatly increase. “ This prospect is, however, unlikely, as such a “ link would be very disadvantageous to Russian “ interests, but even so with the Mohammerah- “ Khoremabad line we should be better placed to “ defend our trade against Russian commercial “ invasion, should Russia begin to construct south- “ wards from Julia. “ If His Majesty’s Government decide for any “ reason to postpone for the present the prosecution of this scheme, Colonel Cox is of opinion that “ we should have recourse to a line from Ahwaz “ or Mohammerah to Shiraz and Bunder Abbas “ via Khor Musa, Bushire being linked up by a “ branch.

Green way, Managing Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a partner in the firm of Lloyd, Scott, &amp; Co., and a Director of the imperial Bank of Persia, was also strongly in favour of such a line, and wrote in a letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 7th January 1911 :— “ I have come to the conclusion that the con struction of a railway from Ahwaz on the Karun, “ via Shustar, Dizful, and Burujird to, say, Sultana- bad, which would give easy road communication to Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, and Tehran, 44 would probably be the most effective and econo- 44 mical means of protecting British interests in the 44 Gulf, and at the same time be the most complete 44 block to German aggression via the Bagdad 44 Railway. 44 Such a railway would not be costly. I have 44 not maps or figures before me, but the cost 4 * would certainly not be more than 2,000,000£. to 44 3,000,000L, and I am assured by officials and “ others who are well acquainted with the country E 3(1) that it would not only tap practically the whole of the trade now carried between Persia and Bagdad (i.e., practically nullify the objec tive of the proposed Russo-German Khanikin line), but also open up a large and new export trade in cereals from the districts around Burujird, Kermanshah, and Ramadan, which is now quite impracticable owing to the prohibitive cost ol transport, and which would not even be open to the suggested Khanikin-Bagdad route because of the high river freight from Bagdad to the Gulf, added to the rail and/or road freight to Bagdad ; (2) that it would, in all probability, be highly remunerative ; and (3) that it would practically ensure to the British sphere the whole of the trade of central and northern Persia not secured by the G 1 aspian, and also open up in competition with Russia a large amount of trade in British cotton goods and other manufactures. “ The capital for this railway, however good its prospects may be, cannot, of course, be obtained from ordinary channels without a guarantee &lt; &gt;f some sort, because of the insecurity of the country.” 44. 'The Secretary of State’s despatch of the 4th November 191U as to the Trans-Persian Rail way was answered in a letter of the Government of India, dated the 23rd February lllll, enclosing, together with a convenient index map, memoranda, &amp;c., by various officers, and the Report of an inter-departmental Committee, consisting of Mr. W. II. Clark (Member of Council), Sir 1) Haig (Chief of tiie General Stall), Sir T. Wynne (President of the Railway Board), and Mr. J. B. W ood (Foreign Department). It may be useful to summarise briefly the opinions that were expressed, though such a summary is necessarily somewhat imperfect. (1) The Political Resident in the Persian Golf (Colonel Cox) favoured an alignment from Kerman via Bam, Regan, Bampur, Serbaz, Kej to Karachi or Hyderabad, as less open to strategical objection than a Kerman-Nushki route, more useful through its tapping of better country, and more useful for checking the Mekran arms traffic. He thought that, as a condition of our co-operation with Russia in promoting the through route, she should join with His Majesty’s Government in obtaining a concession for a Mohammerah-Julfa line, and in commencing the Mohammerah-Hamadan section when the Khanikin branch of the Bagdad Railway was about to be linked with the Russian system via Kermanshah. He favoured concessions, for blocking purposes, of branch lines (1) from Mohammerah via KhorMusa, Behbehan, and Shiraz to Kerman, and (2) from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz, and the actual construction of a line from Bunder Abbas to the through line at Bam.

Noel Paton, McMahon) summarised his arguments and main conclusions in the following words :— “It is unwise to expect that the present isolation “ of Persia can longer continue, or that we can “ indefinitely maintain freedom for India from inter- “ communication by rail from the West. “ The present proposal offers opportunities of a “ mutual arrangement on favourable terms, and, if “ we decline to take advantage of it, we may be “ compelled hereafter to seek similar inter-railway “ connection under less favourable conditions. “ The proposed railway must benefit Russian “ trade in much larger proportion than British “ trade, but it will benefit Indian trade, and largely “ increase the bulk of both British and Indian “ trade by the opening up of Persia. “ It will increase the receipts of Indian railways, “ and thereby benefit Indian revenues. “The military or political disadvantages of “ inter-railway communication are less than might “ at first sight be supposed, and are largely counter- “ acted by the access afforded by the line to “ Seistan. “ These conclusions are arrived at on the “ assumption that our efforts are directed to pre- “ venting the line destroying the autonomy of 44 Persia. ^ 44 On the above grounds the proposal merits 44 favourable reception, but in order to minimize 44 the preliminary advantages of Russia, to assist “ British trade, prevent Russia getting an undue 44 start of British and Indian trade, and for strategic 44 purposes it is absolutely esssential: - “(l.) To construct a line under British control 44 from Bunder Abbas or other Oulf poit to 44 the central line. “(2.) That the Indian railway system be ex- 44 tended to the Indo-Persian border by the 44 easiest and quickest route, i.e., from Nushki. “ (3.) That work on (1) and also from the ludo- 44 Persian border westwards should commence 44 simultaneously with that at the Russian end. “ (4.) That work on (2) be pushed on with speed 44 without necessarily waiting for the com- 44 mencement of the Persian line. “ (5.) That a line be constructed in due course “ from Karachi to meet the central line within 44 British limits. . - (6 1 That no time be lost m commencing the “ necessary railway surveys for all the above 44 lines.” (3 ) The Director-General of Commercial Intel- Uaence (Mr. V. Noel Paton) emphasised the dlthcu1 ^ oi determining to what extent India s present trade ? nr^ Seistm and northwards might grow under rtflu nceof a railway. He agreed generally m he view of the Board of Trade as to the value of he stress or, th. civili.i.g40 that follow from railway construction, and on the assimilation of that part of Persia nearest our borders that a railway might bring about. (5.) The President of the Railway Board (Sir T. Wynne) dwelt on the essential differences between the proposed line and the 'Trans-Siberian Railway, which “ connects Europe by a short route with a “ large cosmopolitan population in the Far East, “ and opens up a cheaper route than the sea-route “ for trade commodities.” He referred to the reduction in steamer fares that the proposed line would probably have to face, and considered that the possibility of goods traffic being carried between England and India was quite out of the question. But, apart fiom its commercial and financial aspect, the project had to lie considered in relation to the political situation, and he suggested “that the “ attitude of India towards this matter should “ be— “yl.) To cordially accept and support the pro- “ posal that an international line should be made “ from Seistan to Baku. “ (2.) To assist in this project India would build “ at once, with its own funds, the line from Nushki “ to Seistan and include it in her railway system. “ The gauge of this line at the present time to be “ left to India to decide, but it should be made an “ essential point that a break of gauge should “ occur at Seistan junction. “ (3.) The sole right to make railways in Persia “ should be secured by the concessionaires of the “ international line, and all branches should be “ built internationally. “ (4.) The basis on which railway rates are to “ be charged should be a matter for future con- “ sideration and agreement. “ (5.) Detailed surveys of the Nushki-Seistan “ line should be put in hand at once.” He also urged the desirability of actual con struction by Indian officers of the railways from Bunder Abbas to Kerman and Bushire to Ispahan. 4 (4.) The Chief of the General Staff (Sir D. Haig) dwelt on the advantages of India’s present isolation and on the largely increased forces that Russia might develop on the North-W est Frontier of India and Afghanistan, if the proposed line were completed. At the same time he recognised that other factors might enter into the question, and argued from this point of view, in favour of an alignment via Yezd to Bunder Abbas (direct) and thence along the sea-coast to Karachi, Bunder Abbas itself to be fortified and held by troops. No connection between this line and either Afghan istan or northern Baluchistan to be permitted, and the extension of Russian or Persian railways through Afghanistan to be more strongly resisted than ever.

A\ ith regard to the merits of the enterprise from the commercial point of view, they agreed generally with the Board of Trade. They did not, moreover, think that the gross earnings of the line would be more than one-fifth of the figure assumed in the Consor tium’s estimate, and they believed that the cost of construction would be at least 50 per cent, higher than that allowed for.‘ : ‘' Proceeding to examine the different routes suggested for the main line^ they decided against a line from Yezd to Xushki via Kerman and Seistan (about 810 miles), from apprehension of its effect upon the mind of the Amir and his advisers, and also on strategical grounds, described in the following words : — “ The adoption of this route would give to Russia “ a railway leading directly to the frontier of “ Afghanistan, and would enable her, in the event “ of war, to turn the Kandahar and Quetta positions. It would also facilitate the transportation by “ Russia of a very large army across two almost waterless deserts—a task which, under present “ conditions and without the help of a rail- “ way, may be regarded as practically impossible “ of accomplishment. As against this, India would “ receive no compensating strategical advantages. “ A line to Seistan from Nushki might to some “ extent assist India to control Western Afghanistan, “ but no point is offered from which a force from “ India could undertake offensive operations against “ Russia ; while the extension of our line to Seistan “ would make it difficult to resist a claim on the “ part of Russia to connect the Trans-Caspian Rail- “ way with the proposed route, in which case she “ would be able to concentrate from two directions. “ Finally, the adoption of the Seistan-Nushki align- “ ment would, owing to its distance from the sea- “ coast, completely neutralise the strategical ad- “ vantage which Great Britain possesses in her “ naval supremacy.” Comparing next the Yezd-Kerman-Bam-Bampur- Kej-Karachi and Yezd-Bunder Abbas-Karachi align ments (about 1,147 and 1,341 miles respectively), the Committee expressed a preference for the latter as being cheaper, further removed from the Afghan border, and more accessible for sea- defence, and they summarised their conclusions, as a whole, by recommending that the Government of India should accept the proposals of the Russian S. 47. F42 Consortium in principle, subject to the following modifications and conditions:— “ (a) that the point of junction of the main “ through route with the Indian railway “ system be at Karachi, and not at Nushki; “ (6) that the route from Yezd to Karachi be “ via Bunder Abbas and thence along the sea- “ coast, subject to reconsideration as the “ residt of actual survey ; “ (c) that concessions be obtained for branch “ lines— “ (i.) from Bunder Abbas or Charbar to “ Regan, Bam, and Kerman ; “ (ii.) from Mohammerah to Ramadan ; “ (iii.) from Mohammerah to Bunder Abbas “ via Khor Musa, Behbehan, and Shiraz ; “ (iv.) from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan ; “ (d) that both the main and the branch lines “ in Persian territory be international, Russia “ and Great Britain holding a preponderating “ share and Persia being admitted to “ participate ; “ (e) that the gauge of the line passing through “ British territory and the British zone be “ different from that of the line in the Russian “ zone, and that the break of gauge be at “ Bunder Abbas on the limit of the British “ zone; “ (/) that in return for our co-operation in the “ main project, Russia should pledge herself “ not to entertain or support, without coming “ to an understanding with Great Britain, any “ proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of “ the Perso-Afghan border within the Russian “ or neutral zones.” 46. The Government of India concurred gene rally in the Committee’s conclusions, except on the following points :— (1.) They saw no reason to treat as inter national any branch lines constructed by Russia or Great Britain in their respective zones, and wished to treat the proposed branch line from Bunder Abbas or Charbar to Kerman as a purely British project. (2.) They were opposed to a line from Bushire to Shiraz, and thought a line from Shiraz to Ispahan would only be useful if the Trans-Persian Railway were to avoid the latter place. (3.) They considered that, if the Trans-Persian Railway was to be the counterpoise to the Bagdad Railway, the concession for a Mohammerah-Hamadan line should be obtained merely for ear-marking purposes, and not with a view to actual construc tion. If, however—they telegraphed later—the Trans-Persian Railway were to fall through, a Mohammerah-Khoremabad line would become of primary importance.

They reserved judgment as to the relative advantages of the Yezd-Kerinan-Bam-Bampur- Kej-Karachi, and the Yezd-Bunder Abbas-Karachi alignments, until the routes should have been examined locally by a railway engineer. In conclusion, they recommended that, if made at all, the Trans-Persian Railway should be com menced as soon as possible, any financial respon sibility to be equally shared between the British and Indian Exchequers. 47. \\ hile the letter of the Government of India was under consideration, the Foreign Office for warded to this Office copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Huth Jackson on the 10th March by two members of the Russian group interested in the project for the Trans-Persian Railway. The fol lowing extract from their letter explains the attitude of the Russian Government as officially communicated to the group* :— “ The (Cabinet is sympathetic to the idea of “ establishing a railway communication from “ Western Europe to India through Russia and “ Persia, and it has nothing against the for- “ mation of a Societe d’Etudes for that purpose; “ but it must indicate that the execution of the “ project must conform itself to the economical “ interests of the Empire, and not be prejudicial to “ the interests of the Exchequer.^ Such is the “ attitude of the Cabinet as regards the question in “ its substance ; as to the details they will have to “ be the object of a special deliberation after the “ Societe d’Etudes shall have submitted the result “ cf its investigations. “ In its very cautious answer the Cabinet has “ taken into consideration a hostile current to the “ project that manifested itself in certain Moscovite “ circles which tried to prove that the opening up “ of Persia to railway enterprises would oblige the “ Russian Government to admit the transit of goods “ thereto which, in its turn, would completely oust “ Russian trade in manufactured goods out of Persia. “ That opinion is not generally received in Moscow. “ For instance, M. Gootchcoff, the Lord Mayor of “ Moscow, and his brother, M. A. Gootchcoff, the “ Speaker of the Duma, sympathise with the “ project. In view of the Moscovite objections, the “ Cabinet instructed the President of the Board of “ Trade to call a meeting for the purpose of inves- “ tigating to what extent the Russian commercial “ interests might be impaired by the construction “ of railways in Persia, and of finding out the best “ eventual compensations. The meeting took place “ in January, and the results were reported to the “ Cabinet bv M. Timasheff. “ The Cabinet, after mature deliberation of this 4&lt; report, pronounced itself, as above mentioned, “ favourable to the project. . . “It is perfectly evident that in its official “ answer, addressed to the promoters of the enter- “ p r i S e, the Cabinet could not give more substantial 1 ’ F 2“ promises, and had to put back all details to the time “ when a Societe d’Etudes would be able to submit “ a scheme, developed on sound bases. But, in “ conversations with Messrs. Bunge and Petch- “ covsky, the Minister of Finance admitted that he “ saw no drawbacks to allotting the surplus of “ income on the Russian railways net coming from “ transit goods and travellers over the Russian “ railway system to and from India to a special “ fund that might serve as a guarantee to the “ debentures of the new line.” In forwarding this letter the Foreign Office expressed a hope “that it maybe found possible “ for His Majesty’s Government to express them- “ selves as favourably towards the scheme as the “ Russian Government have done.” Copy was also received here of the following Despatch addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg :— “ Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. “ (No. 78.) Foreign Office, “ Sir, 14th March 1911. “ Count BenckendorfT reminded me to-day “ that the Russian Government had expressed “ sympathy with the Trans-Persian railway proposal, “ and had said that they could not express a more “ definite opinion before having a project put “ before them by a “ Comite d’Etudes,” and Count “ Benckendorff pressed me as to whether the British “ Government could not say something sympathetic. “ I asked whether the “ Comite d’Etudes ” would “ expect a guarantee. “ Count Benckendorff replied that the idea was “ that the Russian Government should promise “ them the profit on the transit through Russia of “ all goods for the Trans-Persian railway. This “ railway would bring increased traffic to the “ Russian lines in Russia, and the profit on this “ increase would amount to about 4,500,000 roubles' :i: ' * 475,000/., a sum representing rathei “ a year. This was something to begin with. more than 2 P er cent - on tlie cost of con ‘ “ 1 observed that, since M. Sazonow had been so ^ eferred t0 in P ara ^ a P h 38 &gt; “ positive that no guarantee could be given by the Russian Government for any Persian railway, I had assumed that the project could not make / much progress. But, nevertheless, we had lost ‘ no time in communicating with the Government “ of India. I would now' look into wdiat had passed “‘andlet him have a reply. “He reminded me that the Emperor took great “ interest in the question. “ I am, &amp;c., “ E. Grey.” 48. The views of the India Office on the whole matter w T ere communicated to the Foreign Office in a letter dated the 6th April 1911, which is printed as Appendix VI. The letter raised the question—“Why should “ India sacrifice all the strategical advantages of “ her geographical isolation in order to encourage “ a scheme which, wffiatever prospect of profit it “ may offer to her commercial rival, offers none to Views of the India Office.

Pol. 3203/11.45 l ' herself.” The answer was held to be that, with the advent of other Powers in Persia, the geo graphical isolation of India was necessarily doomed, but certain corollaries seemed to follow from it:— (1.) I hat a I rans-Persian railway must “enter “ the British sphere at Bunder Abbas and not at Kerman, and run along the coast to Karachi; and there must be a break of gauge at Bunder “ Abbas.” (-•) I hat “ the actual construction and working of the section in the British sphere must be “ entirely in British hands.” (3.) I hat British capitalists would not entertain the scheme “ unless there is a Government guarantee in some form or another. ’ A decision on this point might be deferred, but it was observed that, if the frontiers of India were made more vulnerable by a scheme of railway construction, her claims upon the Imperial Exchequer would be strong. Subject to these remarks the Secretary of State agreed with the Government of India, and suggested that the assent of His Majesty’s Government should be given to the scheme of the Trans-Persian Rail way in principle, and that application should be made for concessions for blocking purposes as soon as the situation in Persia should permit. It was not thought that the scheme for a Trans- Persian Railway would survive an examination by experts. Further particulars as to scheme for Trans-Persian Railway. Sir G. Buchanan’s Despatch No. 112, 18th April 1911. Pol. 3467/11. 49. Shortly after the issue of this letter, Sir G. Buchanan reported, on the 18th April, that two of the promoters of the Trans-Persian line had informed him that the Russian group was now constituted, and had given him a confidential state ment, embodying the result of further investigations by engineers and others, in which the length of the railway across Persia was calculated at 1,400 miles, the building expenditure (including rolling stock), at 18,700,0001., or even at so low a figure as 15,000,000h, and the annual net revenue at 709.0001. The surplus net revenues that would be gained by Russian railways from the freights brought them by the new railway were valued at 460.0001. a year, and these, together with similar revenues from Indian railways, would, it was hoped, be available for the purposes of an indirect guarantee that would be more than sufficient to make up the difference between the sum of 709,0001. above-mentioned, and the sum of 1,200,0001., which would be required to satisfy the interest of the share and bond holders. Further investigations, it was said, ought to be carried on by a special company or syndicate (societe d'etudes), the formation of which would be the next step, dependent on the British attitude. Some further observations were added as to the general, and political advantages of the line, and inter alia, it F 34(3 was observed that it would strongly compete with a Khanikin-Tehran railway. 50. On the 10th May 1911, the Foreign Office addressed a despatch to Sir G. Buchanan, instructing him to inform the Russian Government that Bis Majesty’s Government were ready to assent in principle to a Trans-Persian Railway, and to agree to the initiation of negotiations between its pro moters in this country and in Russia, subject to the following conditions :— “ 1. The line shall enter the British sphere “ at Bunder Abbas instead of at Kerman, subject “ to reconsideration as the result of actual survey, “ and shall in any case join the Indian railway “ system at Karachi and not at Nushki. “ 2. There shall be a break of gauge at Bunder “ Abbas, or wherever the line enters the British “ sphere of influence in Persia. “3. In return for the co-operation of Great “ Britain in the project, which examination has “ shown to be likely to benefit Russia far more “ than Great Britain or India, Russia shall pledge “ herself not to entertain or support, without “ coming to an understanding with Great Britain, “ any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of “ the Perso-Afghan frontier within the Russian or “ neutral sphere in Persia. “ 4. Russia shall support demands made by “ Great Britain of the Persian Government for “ concessions of the following branch lines “ connected with the proposed Trans-Persian “ Railway : — “ (a) From Mohammerah to Khoremabad, with “ a branch to port to be constructed at “ Khor Musa. “ (6) From Bunder Abbas or Charbar, via Regan “ and Bam to Kerman. “ (c) From Bushire, via Aliabad, to some point “ on a line— “ (d) From Bunder Abbas, via Shiraz, to “ Ahwaz. “ 5. The main line and those of the above “ branches which lie in the neutral sphere— i.e., (a), “ (c), and (d )—shall be internationalised; but the “ branch which lies entirely in the British sphere— “ i.e., (b) —shall be a purely British project. “ 0. Absolute equality of treatment in all respects shall be guaranteed to British and British-Indian “ trade passing over the line and its branches.” Sir G. Buchanan was to be at liberty to explain frankly that the first three of these conditions were dictated by strategic considerations, and had been inserted in the interest of India. He could further make it clear that His Majesty’s Government expressed no opinion as to the commercial or financial aspects of the question. In a note dated the 23rd May, Mr. Huth-Jackson was informed of the main heads of the instructions issued to Sir G. Buchanan. Instructions to Sir G. Buchanan as to proposed Trans-Persian Railway.

Before the issue of the despatch to Sir G. Buchanan the War Office had forwarded to the Foreign Office a memorandum by General Sir W. Nicholson, Chief of the General Staff,’ dated the 26th April 1011, in which he expressed doubt as to the commercial advantage of railway construction in Southern Persia, a country consisting to a large extent of mountains and deserts. Sea-carriage would, he remarked, be always cheaper than car riage by land, and the climate of the Gulf and coast was a serious obstacle to railway communi cation. The protection of the railway between Bunder Abbas and Karachi would necessitate an increase in our naval force in the Gulf and the distribution of a military force along the line. The suggested construction of a fortress and the em ployment of warships to guard a railway were matters that were open to argument. From a naval and military point of view he considered that it would be folly to add to our responsibilities with the object of benefiting and tranquilising Southern Persia. In reply the Foreign Office remarked that the commercial value of a line debouching at Bunder Abbas seemed to have been somewhat underrated by Sir W. Nicholson. Tiiey refrained from dis cussing the measures that might become necessary for defending the line, if built, and explained that the reasons that had weighed in their consent to refer the question of the Trans-Persian Railway to a “ Comite d’etudes ” were that the construction of such a line could not be indefinitely resisted, and that, if constructed, it should follow the route preferred by the Indian Government.

As regards the Trans-Persian Railway, there is, at the time of writing, nothing more to be added to this memorandum. It remains to describe what action has been taken by His Majesty’s Government so far as concerns a concession for a line from Mohammerah to the north. The importance of our obtaining such a con cession was strongly represented to the Russian Government, and Sir G. Buchanan explained on one occasion to the Acting Foreign Minister that, now that Russia was about to admit German goods to the very heart of her zone, it was hardly fair not to allow British goods even to reach its gates,— the new line would only serve to carry goods that now passed into Persia by the Bagdad route, the value of which was about 1,000,000L The Russian Government at first demurred and in conversation with Sir G. Buchanan, the head of the Persian Department informed him that Russia wanted a railway from Julfa to labnz on strate gical as well as commercial grounds, but did not desire its immediate prolongation to Khoiemabad si nee the southern portion would be open to Tur kish attack. In the end the Russian Government withdrew their objection to our applying for an option to construct the Mohammerah-Khoremabad48 line, with, a port at Khor Musa, taking act at the same time of the declaration of His Majesty’s Government that at present it was only a question of securing a concession, and that before proceeding with the construction of the line it wns proposed to enter into a friendly exchange of views with the 1 Russian Government.

Barclay on the 25th April 1911, and ran as follows :— “ (After compliments.) “ Of course British Government will not lose sight of definite wording of Nasr-ed-Din Shah’s “ autograph letter,j' which is as follows :— ‘ Permission will never be granted to anyone “ ‘ to construct any other than a purely commercial ‘ railway in Persia.’ “ Although benefits and advantages of railway “ construction are in no way concealed to Persian “ Government, it is precisely from this point of “ view that Persian Government considers that it “ is excused from granting this option. “ Having, however, earnestly in view develop- “ ment of the two countries, Persian Government’s “ wish is that it may be able to arrange for a “ railway in its own country, which will safeguard l&lt; its political and economic interests, and to study “ question wdth regard to construction of a coni- “ mercial railway which would be in accordance “ with interests of the country. “It is hoped that British Government, whose “ good relations and friendly feelings towards this “ Government have always been highly appreciated, “ will be in agreement with this legitimate aim of “ Persian Government, and will show their good- “ will.” Sir G. Barclay, on receipt of this reply, asked the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs why the enterprise should be supposed to have other than a commercial character, and was informed that the Persian Government would be prepared to take into consideration proposals from a British group for general railway construction in the country. Ihe good offices of His Majesty’s Government would, it was hoped, be exerted to encourage a syndicate to come forward. Reply of the Persian Government to application for concession. Sir G.

As regards what was said ot a scheme for general railway construction in Persia, it may here be explained that a proposal for a scheme of this kind (of which the Trans-Persian Railway should form a part) had already been suggested by the Regent in conversation with Mr. Greenway and in a confidential message to His Majesty’s Minister, in which it was added that, to be palatable to the Persians, any railway scheme had better be of an international character, for example Russo-British- French. In a telegram of the 24th March, Sir G. Barclay similarly reported that, though the Persians realised the necessity for railway con struction, they were haunted by the fear that a railway concession might eventually give a pretext for foreign intervention. In reply to the Regent’s message above referred to, Sir G. Barclay informed him of his readiness to enter on a joint discussion with His Highness and the Russian Minister on the subject of railway construction in Persia.

On receipt of the Persian Government’s note (paragraph 54), it was decided, in consultation with Sir G. Barclay, to inform them that His Majesty Government, appreciated their point of view in not wishing to give to a foreign Government an option for a railway in Persia, but at the same time to ask for a written assurance that the Persian Government would negotiate with a private British syndicate when they wished to construct the Mohammerah, or any other southern line. “His Majesty’s Government would entirely stand aside.” It was explained to Sir G. Barclay that Mr. Greenway, the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Persian Transport Company would be informed that the field was clear for them to negotiate. Sir G. Buchanan was instructed on the 9th May to inform the Russian Government of the substance of the Persian reply to our application, as well as of the rejoinder made to them. This he did on the 10th idem.50 57. The Persian Transport Company, it may here be observed, had some little time previously expressed concern at reported negotiations of the oil syndicate in regard to a railway in South western Persia, and recalled the assurances they themselves held from the British Government for preferential treatment. They were told, in reply, that, while His Majesty’s Government depre cated for the moment applications for railway con cessions by the Company, or anyone else, they would not lose sight of the assurances given* On the 10th May 1911 the Company reminded the Foreign Office of the reply that had been made to them, and forwarded copy of a telegram received from their Agent at Tehran, to the effect that the International Oriental Syndicate were about to offer to construct a railway to Khoremabad from Mohammerah, a loan for the purpose to be secured on the railway, and no consideration to be given by the Persian Government to other offers. 58. In reply to an enquiry from the Foreign Office, Sir G. Barclay telegraphed that commu nications had in fact been passing between the Persian Government and Mr. Osborne’s syndicate for the construction of a Julfa-Mohammerah line, and that he had reminded the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Osborne that the scheme proposed would be impossible without Russian consent. His language was approved by Sir E. Grey, who considered that matters should be allowed to take their course and that he (Sir G. Barclay) should stand aside, in view of the under taking to the Persian Transport Company. 59. In a later telegram Sir G. Barclay further reported that the Russian Minister at lehran had been approached by Colonel Bed does on behalf of Messrs. Seligman, as to the construction of a Julfa- Mohammerah line by an Anglo-Franco-Russian syndicate or some syndicate acceptable to Russia and Great Britain. 60. Meanwhile, so far as concerns the British Govermr hit’s desire for a Mohammerah-Khorema- bad line, arrangements had been made for a survey by Lieutenant A. 1. Wilson of the country between Dizful and. Khoremabad, through which the railway would pass, and the Russian Government have offered no objection to Lieutenant Wilson visiting Burujird (in the Russian sphere) as an ordinary traveller after his survey is completed. The Treasury have agreed to bear a moiety (1) of the estimated cost of Lieutenant Wilsons survey, viz., 600L for six months, and (2) of the pay and allowances of the soldier surveyor who will accompany him, estimated at an additional sum of 43?, 6s. Sd. for the period of the survey. It should be added that the Mohammerah- Dizful section of the proposed railway has been Position of Persian Transport Company.

Pol. 3003/11. 51 described in a memorandum by Lieutenant Wilson, dated the 21st September last. By the route he recommends this section would be 1G4 miles long and would cost about 5U0,000Z. 61. For the sake of completeness mention may here be made of a scheme advocated by Mr. Chick, Commercial Adviser to His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire, in a memorandum on the subject of trade routes in Southern Persia, for a Motor Transport service between Bushire and Shiraz by the Firuzabad route. Colonel Cox was disposed to favour the suggestion, but a necessary preliminary to carrying it out was to have a survey made of the route, and no action in this direction was at first taken. The Foreign Office, however expressed the view that the project was wor f of examination, and the Government of India we asked for their opinion. They replied on the IGtl June to the effect that they preferred to defer a decision regarding the survey until more advance had been made in the general question of railways in Persia. Colonel Cox is inclined to think that the Bushire-Shiraz trade artery and the harbour at Bushire may remain of some importance. Mr. Chick’s idea was that the service might be undertaken by the group supported by the Indo- European Telegraph Company, who have proposed to obtain a similar concession for the Bunder A bbas-Kennan road (jee paragraph 29). G2. It remains to supplement in certain respects what has been said in this Memorandum recrardinsr the attitude of the Russian Government towards raihvay construction in Persia. The important negotiations referred to in paragraph 40, as to a junction at Khanikin, the attitude of Germany, Ac., were interrupted by M. Sazonow’s illness, and were reported by His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg (31st May) to be still unfinished. It is known, however, that the provisions of the draft Russo-German Agreement have undergone modification in certain particulars. The efforts of His Majesty’s Government mean while have been directed towards urging the Russian Government not to part with their control of a line from Khanikin towards Tehran, or, in the alternative, to arrange for its internationalisation. The appre hension has, on more than one occasion, beer expressed by Sir E. Grey lest such a line migh -1 used by the Turks for aggressive purposes. 63. The Russian Government have throng been greatly handicapped by the financial difficu. The Duma, it was explained by M. Sazonow on or occasion, will never sanction a guarantee for rail ways in Persia, while they are so much needed in the interior of Russia, and the Russian Government have consequently been very anxious to secure British capital for their lines of railway in the north of Persia. The difficulty of inducing British capital to invest in Persian railways without some guarantee G 2/ 52 lias been pointed out to them, and emphasis lias been laid on the impossibility of inducing such capital to do for Russian trade in the north what we cannot induce it to do for British t: de in the south. His Majesty’s Government have, however, given the Russian Government an assurance that, in the event of Russia making a line from Julfa to join the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway, they will consider how far it would be possible to encourage British capital to share in the enterprise. The Russian Government ha\u? also been told that, if they can interest British capital in a line they desire to construct from Enzeli to Tehran, there would not be any objection on the part of His Majesty’s ‘ Government,—indeed, on the understanding that Russian Government would not oppose a line m Mohammerah to Khoremabad, His Majesty’s overnment would give every encouragement to such a project. Besides the Enzeli-Tehran line, the Russians have in contemplation a line from Julfa to Tabreez. They desire this for strategical, as well as com mercial, reasons. 64. In conclusion, attention is called to the published opinions, summarised in Appendix IX., of certain authorities on the questions dealt with in this ^Memorandum, viz. : — (1.) Lord Curzon, especially as to the difficulty of a line between Bushire and Shiraz, the favourable prospects of a Mohammerah-Burujird-Tehran line, and his description of the track Bagdad, Kerman- shah, Burujird, Ispahan, Yezd, Kerman, and Seistan, as the true line of Trans-Persian railway communication.

Extract (paragraph 2^ to end) from Minute on Seistan by the Viceroy (Lord Curzon), dated 4th September 189-h enclosed in Foreign Department, Seciet, Letter of the (government of India. No. 175, 21st September 1899. Pol. 927/99. 22. There remains only to he considered the question of a possible railway connection between India and Seistan. This question has been discussed at intervals dm mg the past 12 years, and the history of the discussion is not without its lessons for the future. Ihe first idea of some such railway appears to have originated with the late Sir J. Browne, who, as early as 1884, advocated a line from the neighbour hood of Quetta via Nushki, not to Seistan, hut to Safar, on the Helmand. This proposal was put forward, without any reference to Persia, for strategical reasons, namely, in order to prevent, at any future period, a Russian advance upon Kandahar. It is interesting to me to learn from a study of the papers what I did not know before, viz., that five years later, when I was travelling in Persia, and was first writing about this question, it had just been raised both in India and in Persia b\ a report from Colonel Bell, at that time Head of the Intelligence Department in India, who, in the autumn of 1888, marched from India by Kharan and Mashkel to Seistan, and strongly recommended the construction of a railway and a lease in perpetuity of Seistan from the Persian Government, with a view to the grant of a great irrigation concession to Reuter or to some other Company. The suggestion was eagerly taken up by Sir H. I). Wolff, whose imagination was at that time suffused with halcyon dreams of a regeneration of Persia by universal railways, and was recommended by him both tc the Government of India and to Lord Salisbury. Lord Lansdowne’s Government, in a telegram dated the 20th January 1889, said that “ railway extension through Baluchistan was regarded by the military autho- “ rities as a most valuable adjunct to the defences of India, and as deserving of the utmost encouragement. ’ Sir H. \\ olff’s proposals did not make much advance, but were reiterated by him in despatches to the Foreign Office, dated the 2oth July and 19th August 1890. Unfortunately in these, as in his original despatch of the 19th February 1889, Sir. H. Wolff rested his defence of the scheme upon extremely contentious and entirely unacceptable grounds. He advocated it for two reasons ; as a menace to the Transcaspian Railway of Russia, and as the saving of a long land march in the event of our desiring to take the offensive against that power. This line of argument was completely riddled in a memorandum, dated the 2nd October 1890, by General Brackenbury, at that time Head of the Intelligence Department at home. He pointed out that a single line to a remote corner of Persia could not counterbalance the position of Russia in that country, would not help us in the least on the Afghan border or in Afghan-Turkestan, and would be of no use for assuming the offensive. He concluded by saying: “ By far the more important task is not the “ construction of a new line to Seistan, but the consolidation of our power there by ' bringing the frontier tribes under our influence, and by developing Baluchistan and converting it into a fertile base of operations. When this has been done, it will be time to push forward into Persia.’’ 23. General Brackenbury s criticism was destructive of the proposal viewed as an offensive and strategical scheme. But a corresponding flaw in his own argument was at once pointed out by Lord Salisbury, who noted that the real object of. a54 Seistan railway would be not to attack Russia in Northern Persia, but to save Southern Persia from falling into her grasp, which could be done either by a line from Quetta, or, as he would himself prefer, by a line from the sea. 24. General Brackenbu^-’s criticism was sent out to the Government of India, and was thus noted upon by Sir G. Chesney on the 13th January 1891: “ Tim “ railway can only be regarded as a work of military precaution. From this point of view it appears to me that the time cannot be far distant when it will be deemed “ necessary. Still more important is a railway from the Persian Gulf north to “ Seistan, but the connecting link between this line and the Quetta railway system “ will also be found necessary.” 25. A little later Sir H. Braekenbury, now Military Member in India, again noted upon the scheme, and it is interesting to read his remarks in the light of his former opinion. He now explained (27th April 1891) that he had only objected to a Seistan railway so long as the Russian railway did not extend south of the Trans caspian line, and because to construct a railway to Seistan would compel her to make extensions. “ But if circumstances should change, and if Russia should take the lead in making railways southward, then it may become necessary for us to ” follow her lead. We ought to be able to keep pace with her.” 26. These conditions had not yet been realised, and the Government of India decided to proceed no further with the scheme. The question of a more southerly line from the sea was at the same time considered in connection with Sir R. Sandeman’s proposals to take over Kej and Panjgur—a project which was revived in 1894 by his successor, Sir J. Browne. On both occasions, however (as again at a later date), the proposal to assume administrative responsibility for Makran was negatived by the Government of India, and with it the idea of a Makran railway from the sea to Seistan was dropped also. Since then the question has not been revived. 27. It will be clear from the above narrative, firstly, that the idea of a Seistan railway does not appear to have ever been considered by the Government of India from the only point of view in which, in my opinion, it ought to be regarded, viz., as a protective, and not an offensive, measure. The reason perhaps is that, at that time, Russia had not given such unmistakable evidence of her intention to move southward from Meshed, and to draw Seistan within the radius of her political influence. The railway was accordingly discussed and condemned, as a means of attacking Russia in Northern Persia, not as a means of keeping Russia out of Southern Persia. Moreover, at that time, the Quetta-Seistan trade route not having yet been opened, the possible commercial value of the line was not taken into account at all. Secondly, it will be noticed that the conditions postulated by Sir H. Brackenbury in London as precedent to any idea of railway construction in this quarter have since been realised. Baluchistan is rapidly being developed, the frontier tribes have passed completely under our control, a permanent line of communication with Seistan has been opened, while the very conditions which he said, when in India, might compel a change of attitude on our part, viz., Russian initiative in the process of southerly extension from her existing railway system, have been fulfilled by the construction on her part, without provocation or incentive from us, of the Merv-Kushk line, it is clear, therefore, that the question stands on a different footing from any that it has previously occupied, and that the facts and arguments which weighed with our predecessors are inapplicable to the present situation. 28. As regards the physical and engineering difficulties by which such a line might be confronted,^ I may cite the following opinion from the Report in 1897 of Lieutenant Webb Ware: “No one who has traversed this country can fail to be “ struck with the marvellous facilities which the country between Nushki and “ Seistan offers for the construction of a railway. Scarcely a single material obstacle ‘‘exists to bar the road; throughout the gradient is exceedingly gentle; bands of sand can as a rule be avoided ; of fuel there is an abundance ; while not a bridge “ of more than one span, or engineering work of any magnitude, is requisite. Added “ to this, the mineral wealth of the Koh-i-Sultan and the hills to the west, at present “ lying untouched, is so considerable as in itself to offer very great inducements to “ railway enterprise. Such a railway would place the trade of Eastern Persia and “ Seistan at our feet, unlock such Central Asian markets as are now closed, give us a “ preponderating influence in Eastern Persia, and open to India the rich grain fields “ of Seistan.”55 2'.). It would appear, therefore, that so far as gradients, water-crossings, and fuel are concerned, little or no difficulty would be met with in laying a line across the 400 and odd miles that intervene between Nushki and Seistan. On the other hand, I am inclined to think that at present a very serious obstacle would present itself in the complete dearth of water over long stretches of this route, and in the problem of the shifting sands. Both of these difficulties have been overcome b} r Russia, though only at great expense, and with the aid of a large permanent staff, upon her 1 ranscaspian Railway. She has had, moreover, the assistance of a settled population and the advantage of numerous inhabited sites along the railway line. These advantages would, at any rate, at the start be wanting in the case of a Quetta-Seistan railway. For some time the trade by such a line, though it would probably develop with great rapidity, would not be remunerative ; while the railway would have no other immediate use, inasmuch as it would not be a line of connection between important centres of population, industry, or arms, but would, so to speak, end in the air.^ If it stopped at the Anglo-Persian border, it would still be 90 miles distant from Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan. The chances of prolongation to the latter would appear to be problematical in view of the engagements against the introduction of railways which Persia has allowed to be imposed upon her by Russia. The question of the military protection of the line, if constructed, is one upon which expert opinion would be required to pronounce, although, in the yearlv increasing tranquillity of the districts which it would traverse, I do not conceive that any serious difficulty would thereby be caused. 30. The Government of India have in the accompanying despatch suggested the desirability of coming to an understanding with Russia concerning spheres of interest in Persia, which would leave Seistan within the British zone. In such a case there might be no necessity, at any rate for the present, for a Quetta-Seistan railway. We could then devote ourselves to the diligent promotion of the resuscitated caravan route, an:! look forward to the day when, the Helmand being in our hands, we might convert Seistan into a flourishing outpost on the flanks of British India that would call for railway connection with the lines and resources of the interior. ul. E\en in the event of such an understanding being declared impracticable while I hold firmly to the opinion that we should then be bound to adopt such measures for the protection of Southern Persia and of our interests in that quarter as we might deem desirable, and while I concur with Lord Salisbury in thinking that a Quetta-Seistan railway might be found to be one of these, I am yet in favour of consolidating our position in the interim, of fostering the incipient trade, of acquiring further information about the tracts to be traversed, and of familiarising the Perso- Baluch border lands, and Seistan in particular, with our presence and influence before we decide upon such a forward move. It would at any time be a comparatively easy task to connect Quetta by railroad with Nushki (90 miles), and such an extension would afford no inconsiderable relief to the Persian caravans, who now have to proceed with their camels to Quetta, where there is no camel-grazing, and where the prices for fodder are high, instead of returning at once, after a few days’ rest, from Nushki. But 1 should like to see Nushki also developed, as I believe it is likely to be, by an interval of settled British administration, and by the measures which I am recommending, in connection with the trade route before I advocate even this advance. In a few years’ time we shall be in a better position to pronounce upon ideas, the execution of which would for the present be somewhat in the nature of an experiment. APPENDIX II. {Referred to in paragraph 18.) RUSSIA AND THE PERSIAN GULF. Extract (paragraph 12 to end) from Minute by the Viceroy (Lord Curzon), dated 28th October 1901, enclosed in Foreign Department, Secret, Letter of the Government of India, No. 183, 7th November 1901. (P. 176) Pol. 1376/01. 12. The subject is two-fold, commercial and political. By the efforts of our traders during the past century we have built up a commerce (in the main from India) with the ports of the Persian Gulf and with the cities of Southern and Central and even of Northern Persia, which possesses an annual value of several millions G 456 sterling. It is not too much to say that we have created this market, and that in the southern zone we still monopolise it. The political absorption of Persia by Russia means the certain proscription and the ultimate extinction of this trade—at least in every article in which Russia can compete with India or Great Britain. Where now is the Indian or the British trade with Tiflis, Bokhara, and Samarkand? Persia would follow suit; and a system of carefully differentiated tariffs would, in a short time, deprive India of one of her best and most lucrative markets. 13. These considerations are sufficiently serious. The political ones are more so the Russian Railway to Kushk (where the materials are stored for the 70 miles prolongation to Herat) already places that fortress within the grasp of Russia, should she at any time care to run the risk of a casus belli with Great Britain But the Russian railway about to be constructed to Meshed if prolonged, as is the intention to Seistan, and ultimately to the Gulf, will dispense Russia from the necessity of crossing the Afghan frontier on the Herat side. From Persian territory she will menace the entire western dank of Afghanistan. She will command the Herat- Kandahar road and will render insecure any future British occupation of Kandahar Lower down, m the unsettled tracts of Baluchistan and Makran, which we have at present only imperfectly brought under our control, there would be limitless scope foi frontier disturbance and local intrigue. We should be compelled, at the cost of a gi eat expenditure of money and of a serious addition to our responsibilities, to invest our authority over those regions with a more concrete character, and to maintain posts and garrisons to guard what would then have become a vulnerable though it is now a negligible, section of the Indian border. j- 14 ' 7r e ^ Iil ? ute ' vllic}l I wrote on 4th September 1899, and sent home to the India Office with the Government of India’s Hespatch of 21st September 1899, sufficiently indicated the extreme strategical importance to India of Seistan The success that has attended the efforts which we have since made to develop the trade loute from India to that part of Persia the value of the trade having risen in two years from 7} to 15 lakhs —has tended to increase both our interest and our influence in that portion of the Shah’s dominions, and has encouraged us to project the earlv construction of a railway from Quetta to Nushki, i.e,, over the first 90 miles of the route. A Russian railway through Seistan to the Gulf—followed as it must be bv the political absorption of Seistan would not merely kill this promising enterprise and close the one remaining overland trade route (that to Yarkand and Kashgar is already nearly dead) that still remains open to Indian commerce, but it would have the following further and even more serious consequences. It would place Russia m control of a district ethnographically connected with Baluchistan, would pro foundly affect our prestige both with Afghan and Baluch, and would greatly enhance the difficulties that we already experience in managing the cognate tribes on the Indian side of the border. If Great Britain is ever called upon to advance to Kandahar, as she will probably one day be compelled to do, an intolerable state of iriction would arise between the Powers that would then control the upper and the lower waters of the Helmund. Moreover, while Seistan, if it ever fell under British influence, coidd, owing to the protecting floods upon the north, be easily defended against Russian attack from the direction of Meshed, our present frontier (should Seistan pass into the hands of Russia), being entirely exposed, would enjoy no similar immunity. 1 might easily enlarge at greater length upon the strategical importance to India of Seistan. But as 1 believe it to be now generally recognized both here and in England, it will be sufficient to say that a Russian railway through Eastern Persia to the Persian Gulf means neither more nor less than the final loss to Great Britain of Seistan : and that the recent declarations of the British Government as to our interests in that quarter forbid me to believe that they would acquiesce in any such calamity. For my own part, if Persia were to hypothecate to Russia the revenues ol Seistan (a move which has recently been under contemplation, but vhich l should regard as not less insulting to ourselves than would be to Russia the hypothecation of the revenues of Meshed to Great Britain), or to cede to Russia a commanding political position on that section of the border, I should not hesitate to advise that the Persian Government be compelled to cancel the arrangement. Such a peril can, hov ever, be more opportunely averted by a plain declaration of our views and intentions in advance, than by threats or military movements afterwards. 15. Should a Russian naval port be constructed in the Gulf, and should a Russian fleet (most likely in connection with the French) be called into existence in ihe Indian Ocean, it is impossible, either for the protection of our trade, or for57 ?;Z { 7'f Tml'T' 8l T 8 ' tha ‘ we f 0ul , d remain cunten t with the existing strength cotsts oMnV 8 ff dr r We , 8ho,,1,i liave t0 p |ace the ports on the eastern mUi£ rv m . a 8 6 , o 1 ' 6 fi ' isl * C&lt;l defence than is at Pre^nt the case.

As I have previously argued, a commercial port, as the terminus of a commercial railway, may be rendered equally innocuous anywhere in the Gulf. But if it is to be a political port, and the terminus of a political railway, then it is equally objectionable wherever it be placed, and the mere geographical distance of a few hundred miles, or one or two days steam ma es no difference in the situation, Political control over Southern Persia can equally be disseminated from lines terminating at Mohammerah, Bushire, Bunder Ablias, or Charbar. Whichever be the naval base, the ships that lie there can equally menace Indian commerce, Indian shipping, and Indian interests. Moreover, wlnle at the near end of the Gulf a Russian railway to the sea would have the drawbacks already mentioned of invading the British sphere of interest in Seistan and Persian Baluchistan, of destroying British influence in those regions, and of directly menacing the British-protected territories of the Khan of Kalat—a Russian railway to the upper end, ea?., to Mohammerah on the Karun, would similarly traverse a region (that inhabited by the Lur and Bakhtiari tribes) in which British influence has hitherto remained uncontested, and where British enterprise has establised an adventurous and successful foothold, and would terminate in a port which is owned by an Arab Sheikh whose family has been uniformly friendly to the British power, and which commands the main channel of the Shat-el-Arab or combined estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates. 'To concede such a position to Russia would place the approach to Baghdad within her power, and would extinguish the influence of Great Britain in Turkish Arabia. IS. The international aspect of the acquisition by Russia of a port at either end of the Persian Gulf cannot be ignored. Such an incident could not possibly stand alone. ( nder instructions from the Home Government we have recently submitted to them plans for counter-action in such a contingency, involving the seizure of certain Persian islands or harbours, in self-protection and retaliation, by ourselves. But neither would the action be confined to Russia and Great Britain. France and Germany would unquestionably appear upon the scene. The disastrous contagion of Kiao-chow would lie reproduced ; and the Persian Gulf—for 100 years, so far as political predominance is concerned, a British lake—would become a second Gulf of Pechili, to be quarrelled over and parcelled out by the greed of rival Powers, rids is no fanciful picture of the imagination. It is an indisputable deduction from th 1 circumstances of the case. 19. Finally, let me contemplate the effect that would be produced by the concession of a Persian railway and a Persian port to Russia upon the general problem of Indian defence. A glance at the map will show that India would then be surrounded in a ring fence by Russia and her ally. Following this line from West to East I have already shown the position at which Russia aims as threatening the entire western borders of Baluchistan and Afghanistan from the Persian Gulf to Herat. Herat itself could lie taken by the Russians in less than three weeks. From Herat to the O.xus the Afghan frontier is it the mercy of the Russian forces. The course of the &lt; )xus from Charjui to the Pamirs is now under their control. They can cross it at any point at any time without our knowledge and without the possibility of interruption. We are obliged even now to keep a close watch upon the northern passes of the Hindu Kush. East of the Pamirs, the Russians have already taken up a position in the Taghdumbash Pamir, which will presently make their frontier adjacent to our own on the Mustagh Range. 'The fall of Kashgar and Chinese Turkistan is absolutely certain and cannot very much longer be delayed. S. 47. HTibet will still intervene between Russian territory and our own on the north ; but already rumours of a Russian Protectorate have been heard, and a mission from Lhasa has been received by the Tsar. On the extreme east of British territory in Burma, we encounter the rival ambitions and expanding influence of France, whose aspirations do not fall short of the complete absorption of the kingdom of Siam. It is far from improbable that within twenty, perhaps within twelve, years from the present time, the metaphor previously employed will have been justified, and the Indian Empire, along the complete length of its land frontiers, will be coterminous with the territories, and confronted with the ambitions, of Powers whose interests are on the whole inimical to its own. In such a case—and it is no idle dream of fancy, as the future will show—we shall not be able to move, to strike, to advance, in any part of the world where French or Russian interests are involved, because of the menace that will stand perpetually at our Indian doors. Of the strain upon Indian finances, I do not at present speak : but it would be altogether in excess of our means. In this ring fence there are at present three gaps : the still independent kingdom of Siam on the east, the portion of whose territories lying nearest to the Indian frontier has been guaranteed by a Convention between Great Britain and France ; on the north the upland wilds of Tibet, as yet impervious to alien intrusion ; and on the west the dominions of the Shah. These are the sole remaining buffers that separate the Asiatic possessions of Great Britain from her European rivals. It rests with British statesmanship to retain all three intact. But it will sacrifice the most important of their number if it knowingly concedes to Russia that gratification of her ambition in Eastern Persia, the consequences of which to the British Empire it has been been the object of this Minute to expose.

APPENDIX (Referred to in paragraph 26.) Memorandum dated the 9th October 1908, in reply to Russian Aide-Memoire of 15th August 1908. (P. 18.) Pol. 3970/08. His Majesty’s Government have examined with much interest and careful attention the aide-memoire communicated by the Russian Government to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg on the 2nd (15th) August on the subject of railway construction in Persia. Some misapprehension appears to have arisen in regard to the precise nature of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, who, in approaching the Russian Government, contemplated not actual construction, but rather timely co-operation in ear-marking Concessions which otherwise might be exploited to the detriment of Great Britain and Russia. His Majesty’s Government attach the highest importance to a complete under standing with the Russian Government on this question. They consider, however, for reasons which will be indicated forthwith, that any Convention now concluded by the two Powers with the Persian Government should be of a protective character, and calculated to assure to Great Britain and Russia a secure position as regards enterprises involving political issues whenever the time is ripe for construction. Apart from the uncertainty of the political situation, there are many factors, now unknown quantities, which, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, render impracticable, in existing circumstanees, any definite scheme of railway development in Persia, such, for instance, as ihe absence, at any rate in Southern Persia, of all surveys, even of a preliminary character, as the ultimate constitution of the Bagdad Railway Company, and as the question of whether or not a bfttnch line is constructed from Bagdad to Khanikin. Many developments of this nature' must be awaited before a railway from Julia to Mohammerah can he built with adequate prospects of commercial success. Moreover, the principal obstacle to railway construction in the immediate future is undoubtedly to be found in the governing consideration of cost, and in the difficulty of securing the necessary capital. The Russian aide-memoire emphasizes the inability of the Persian Government to meet the requisite expenditure, and the reluctance of the Russian Ministry of Finance to afford pecuniary assistance for this purpose. His Majesty’s Government on their part are fully persuaded that no projects of railway enterprise in Persia in the present economic and political condition of the country would be sufficiently attractive to induce Butish capitalists to select them as a field for investment ■ while His Majesty’s Government would not feel justified in guaranteeing a minimum rate of interest where the risk involved would be difficult to estimate, but undoubtedly considerable. J His Majesty’s Government find some difficulty in appreciating the full inwardness of the suggestion contained in the Russian aide-memoire that the question of an important external loan is intimately connected with that of a Railway Concession, and should be dealt with simultaneously. If it is considered that a loan should be made to Persia on more favourable terms than would otherwise be the case, in return for the grant ol a Railway Concession, then an addition must be made pro tanto to the cost of constructing the railway. His Majesty’s Government are not convinced that such procedure would be financially expedient, and they incline to the beliefthat it would tend to simplicity if these distinctive operations were to be considered upon their respective merits. As regards the question of an external loan, a comprehensive despatch, of which the substance will shortly be communicated to the Russian Government by His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, has recently been received from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran on the subject of the actual financial position of the Persian Government. Mr. Marling, after reviewing the principal aspects of the question, arrives at the conclusion that the resources of the Persian State are, if properly administered, amply sufficient to enable necessary expenditure to be covered by existing revenue, ami he expresses his conviction that any large advance made to the Persian Govern ment from abroad might, in the long run, aggravate rather than effectually relieve the present financial stress. His Majesty’s Government consider that the efforts of Great Britain and Russia should be directed to impressing upon the Persian Government that the real interests of the State imperatively demand a policy of retrenchment and financial reform ; that such reform must constitute the bed-rock of all economic progress and commercial prosperity ; and that, as a preliminary step in the desired direction, the Persian authorities should make it their first aim to afford the Financial Inspector full support and loyal co-operation. It is, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, only upon the establishment of financial equilibrium in the Persian Budget that the question of actual railway consti notion in the country can be faced with due regard to the elementary principles of commercial prudence. This construction should, they consider, be carried out under such conditions that a minimum rate of interest upon the capital involved would be secured, without the risk of defalcation, by the Persian Government. His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that, in view of the important political interests at issue, Great Britain and Russia would be fully justified in informing the Persian Government that, in the event of railway communications being established in Persia, they would expect to have the refusal, upon terms equally favourable to any offered by third parties, of all Concesssions which might be in contemplation. His Majesty’s Government are well aware of the existence of the Russo-Persian understanding which precludes the grant of any Railway Concession in Persia before November 1910. A somewhat similar arrangement is in force between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government whereby, in the event of railway construction being undertaken north of Tehran, a Concession for a railway in the south would forthwith be accorded to a British Company. His Majesty’s Government would suggest that these Agreements might well be made the basis of a further communication to the Persian Government, and at the same time the British and Russian Governments might intimate the lines to which they respectively attach especial importance. The Russian Government have already acquainted His Majesty’s Government with their views on this aspect of the question. His Majesty’s Government, on their part, besides the southern section of a line which may be built from Julia to Mohammerah, would specify, as the Concessions which most closely concern them, the lines Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and Bunder Abbas, via Shiraz, to Ahwaz, with the option to construct a port at Khor Musa. It is stated in the Russian aide-memoire that the lines in the Russian sphere should serve to maintain and develop Russian interests (a) by the chronological order in which they are built, and (6) by adjustment of Tariff rates on the Moham merah Railway. His Majesty’s Government consider that the drawbacks, in existing circumstances, of entering into detail as to the adjustment of Tariff rates, the allotment of shares, or the constitution of the Board of Control, are obvious, and they submit that any attempt to settle these matters would be premature and likely to lead to future embarrassment. However far they might be prepared to meet the Russian Govern ment in regard to the order in which the several lines may be built (a point which may well be reserved for subsequent consideration), they cannot but feel that it would be well-nigh impossible, if the Mohammerah Railway is to be worked on a commercial basis, to assent to anything that could be regarded as a discrimination of Tariff rates in favour of Russian goods. In conclusion, His Majesty's Government, animated by a spirit of sincere friend ship towards the Russian Government, and impressed with the importance of H 464 avoiding any action which may prejudice the beneficial development of commercial and political relations between the two countries, venture to express the hope that the question of connecting Askhabad with Meshed by rail may be allowed, for the present, to remain in abeyance. They are apprehensive lest, in the existing state of political feeling in Afghanistan, an additional element of unrest might be intro duced into a situation which is already not devoid of difliculty if this question were to be prematurely brought into prominence. Foreign Office, 9th October 1908. APPENDIX VI. (Referred to in paragraph 48). Letter of India Office to Foreign Office, dated the 6th April 1911, as to the Trans-Persian Railway. Pol. 3203/11. India Office, Sir, 6th April 1911. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, marked confidential, of the 20th instant, regarding the proposed Trans-Persian Railway, and to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter, No. IS. Secret, dated 23rd February 1911, and enclosures, that has been received from the Government of India on the same subject. The communication from the Russian promoters appears to add nothing to the information conveyed in Sir G. Buchanan’s Despatch No. 29, of 31st January last, except the fact that they seem to think themselves justified by the attitude of the Russian Government in proceeding with the scheme. That attitude is described by the Russian Government themselves as follows: — “ The council was generally favourable to the proposal brought forward by the promoters of the enterprise that a special commission (‘ societe d’etudes ’) should be instituted for a preliminary study of the question on the under standing, however, that the realisation of the scheme shall not involve loss to the Russian Treasury or damage the economic interests of Russia. “ The decision of the Council of Ministers on this subject will take final shape as soon as the Ministries interested have arrived at an agreement.” And it has been added in conversation that the only financial support that the enterprise would receive from the Russian Government would be a certain share in any surplus profits that might accrue to the State railways from increased receipts due to the transit traffic in goods and passengers through Russia. Sir E. Grey expresses the hope that it maybe possible for His Majesty’s Government to adopt an attitude towards the scheme not less favourable than that of the Russian Government. It will be seen from the Government of India’s letter and the papers enclosed therein that from the point of view of through traffic, whether of goods or passengers, a Tians-Persian railway such as that proposed is thought to have no prospects of financial success, and, further, that India can hope to derive from the development of local traffic no commercial advantage at all commensurate with that which Russia may expect. If this view is sound—and I am to say that Viscount Morley concurs generally in it— the question arises Why should India sacrifice all the strategical advantages of her geographical isolation in order to encourage a scheme which, whatever prospect of profit it may offer to her commercial rival, offers none to herself ? An indirect answer may perhaps be given to this question. It may be pointed out that with the advent of other Powers in Persia, seeking spheres of commercial if not of political expansion, the geographical isolation of India is necessarily doomed, and that it behoves those who are responsible for her interests to be foremost in the race for concessions, so as to ensure that such at least as may be strategically and politically essential to her security shall be in her own hands. One or more of these concessions would be for railway lines which, though their immediate purpose would be different, might, without disadvantage, form connecting links in a Trans- Persian railway.► 12*1 65 Lord Morley thinks that this is, on the whole, a reasonable answer. But certain corollaries appear to follow from it:— Whatever the alignment of the rest of the line, it is essential that that part of it which will be in the British sphere shall be determined solely with a view to Indian interests. The line must therefore, in Lord Morley’s opinion, enter the British sphere at Bunder Abbas, and not at Kerman, and run along the coast at Karachi; and there must be a break of gauge at Bunder Abbas. (2.) W Idle the through line may be international as regards the financial interests admitted (and in this connection I am to observe that it will be neither possible nor desirable to exclude German capital), it is essential that the actual .construction and working of the section in the British sphere should be entirely in British hands ; but there would be no objection to placing abroad contracts for a certain proportion of the materials and rolling stock. (3.) It is practically certain that British capitalists will not entertain the scheme unless there is a Government guarantee in some form or another. And this raises a very important and difficult question of principle. Before dealing with that I am to observe, on a point of detail, that the proposed Russian guarantee appears to be illusory. It is true that in Sir E. Grey’s Despatch, No. 78, to Sir G. Buchanan, dated 14th March, Count Benckendorff is reported to estimate the profit on increased traffic on Russian' railways at 4,500,000 roubles (about 475,0001.) a year. Lord Morley is unable to conjecture upon what data this estimate is based ; but it is obvious that, if the view taken above be correct, and the through traffic be not likely to pay, the increase of traffic in Russia itself must be of modest dimensions ; and if the Government of India’s Committee are correct in thinking that the Consortium have enormously over-estimated the gross earnings of the through line, the Russian Government’s “ guarantee fund ” will manifestly be inadequate. But whatever view Russian financiers may take of it, British financiers are likely to require from their own Government some more substantial consideration. Lord Morley is not aware what are Sir E. Grey’s views upon this subject, but it will be seen that the Government of India recommend that any financial responsibility undertaken by Great Britain should be equally shared between the Indian and British exchequers. This recommendation will call for serious consideration in view of the heavy expenditure already borne by India in providing for the defence of her frontiers. If those frontiers are made more vulnerable by a scheme of railway extension, which Imperial policy and the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the European Powers force upon the acceptance of India, her claims upon the Imperial Exchequer will be strong. But at present the railway project is only under examination, and it is reasonable to defer a decision in regard to the guarantee until the conclusions of the experts have been received. Subject to these remarks his Lordship agrees with the Government of India, and would suggest that the assent of His Majesty’s Government should be given to the scheme in principle, and that application should be made for the concessions for blocking purposes, as soon as the situation in Persia permits. The project can then be examined in detail by an expert body similar to the Russian societc d'etudes. 1 am to add that Lord Morley is of opinion that it will not survive such an examination. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State, R.

M. le Ministre, SlsOfarTmi. It will doubtless not have escaped the memory of the Persian Government that in a rescript addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 16th September 1888, His Imperial Majesty Nasreddin Shah gave priority to His Majesty’s Government over others for the construction of a southern railroad and a positive assurance that no southern railway would be granted to any foreign company without consultation with His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s (Government feel that the essential need for railway construction in Southern Persia, not only for the development of British trade with Persia but also for the prosperity of Persia herself, must be evident to the Persian Government. In particular it would seem of the first importance to establish a port at Khor Musa and railway communication from that place northwards, and His Majesty’s Govern ment are therefore desirous of obtaining a concession for this enterprise. 1 am accordingly as a first step towards the realisation of the project in question instructed by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to apply on behalf of His Majesty’s Government for an option from the Persian Government for a concession for a port at Khor Musa and for a railway northwards as far as Khoremabad with branch to Mohammerah, if found desirable. 1 feel confident that Your Excellency will realise that His Majesty’s Government, in making this application, are actuated as much by motives of friendship towards Persia as by concern for the interests of British trade, and that the Persian Govern ment will give it their favourable consideration, bearing in mind that the present application is for an option only, and that the details of the concession can be discussed subsequently.

Lord Ourzon, Persia and the Persian Question (1892), Vol. L, Oh. 18, pp. 613-639* also Oh. 9, pp. 235 -244 (Seistan). To some extent what is here said, especially as to Seistan, should no doubt be considered as superseded by the later official minutes, Ac., of Ix)rd Curzon, to which reference is made in the Memorandum. Attention may, however, be called to one or two passages of special interest. On the general geographical position Lord Ourzon wrote (p. 613; : “ Every railway “ from the coast must perforce climb from the sea level to that of the elevated “ plateau, varying from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height, which constitutes the bulk of “ Persia, and upon which all the great cities are placed. The passes conducting to68 “ this plateau are commonly of great altitude and steepness, ranging from 4,000 to “ 8,000 feet in height, and being as a rule so precipitous that even mule traffic upon “ them is not unattended with danger. Herein lies a preliminary obstacle, con- “ querable indeed by engineers, but only at a hazardous cost to the pocket either “ of Government or of shareholders.” The following lines of railway were then considered :—(1) Tiflis-Tabriz-Tehran (p. 625), (2) Baku-Lenkoran-Reslit-Tehran (p. 626), (3) Meshed-i-Ser-Tehran (p. 626), (4) Gurgan Valley, i.e., Gez to Bujnurd and Kuchan (p. 626), (5) Askhabad-Kuchan- Meshed (p. 627), (6) 1)ushak-Sarakhs-Meshed (p. 627), '7) Tehran-Meshed (p. 628), (8) Seistan Railway (p. 628), (9) Trans-Persian Line (p. 629), (10) Buslii re-Teh ran (p. 629), (11) Mohammerah-Burujird-Tehran (p. 630), and (12) Bagdad-Tehran (p. 631); lastly, the Indo-Mediterranean railways. As regards (10), Lord Curzon did not think that the project of uniting Bushire with Tehran via Shiraz would ever be realised, owing to the enormous difficulties of the country between Shiraz and the sea, though a line from Ispahan to Tehran was quite feasible. Of the prospects of (11), a Mohammerah-Burujird-Tehran line, he was much more sanguine, pointing out that there was a consensus of opinion that it was the railway most likely to pay in Persia. Of (11), the Bagdad-Tehran Railway, he wrote : ” This line might be expected to do a considerable business, though it “ would be a costly one to construct, the ascent from the Chaldaean plains to the Persian plateau being very steep and difficult. But neither in goods nor in passenger traffic could it compete with the line last sketched, nor would it tap the ” resources of so extensive a country, nor be so easily reached from the sea.” His conclusion as regards a Euphrates Valley railway, approaching Bagdad from the Mediterranean, was that it “did not for the present at any rate lie within the domain ol practical politics.’ This opinion was based on physical, political, military, and economic grounds. A continuation of the line from the head of the Gull byway of Mohainmerah, Bushire, Lingah, Bunder Abbas, d ask, and Gwadur to Karachi, would fail, he said, even more conspicuously on the four-fold test :—” It ” would be costly, absolutely unremunerative to Persia, and perilous to health.” Ol a line from Bagdad along the Euphrates or Tigris Valley, and then via Shuster, Shiraz, and Bunder Abbas, along the Mekran Coast to Karachi he had no high opinion. The true line of Trans-Persian railway communication would, he thought, be more to the north, uniting the great agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial cities ol Persia. “ Such a line is more likely to be found along the track Baghdad, Kermanshah, Burujird, Isfahan, Yezd, Kerman, which I believe to be the ultimate route of through communication by rail, in the far distant days when such a development becomes possible. \\ hat I have elsewhere said with reference to a Seistan railway will show how this scheme might connect with the Indian railways, and how it would possess the further advantage, if ever ” constructed and brought into communication with Europe, of depositing the British soldier, not merely at Karachi, but on the Afghan frontier itself, and at “ the probable theatre of war.” II this line were ever realised, he thought connection with the Mediterranean would be effected by already existing railways in Asia Minor.

't ate commented on the general desire of Russian officers in Central Asia to connect the Trans-Caspian Railway with the Indian railways at Herat. He did not himself see how such a line would pay or what goods would travel by it. Passengers would prefer the sea route via Marseilles. He did not see that India would gain anything except quicker mails. (HD Colonel Sir F. H. Holdich, K.C.M.G., Ac., The Indian Borderland (1901) pp. 219-224. Sir T. Holdich considered that a coast line from Basra and Bushire along the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf and the northern shores of the Arabian Sea toI 3 Karachi and Sind must be relegated to the category of the “ improbable (if not impossible),” and this “ not so much on account of the natural obstacles (which are “ formidable enough to render the cost of the line prohibitive), as the insufferable “ nature of the climate.” Between Bushire and Bunder Abbas the line could run either on the coast or—better, but more expensive—by the highlands via Jam and Hormuz. From Bunder Abbas to Jask, and onward by Charbar and Pasni to Karachi, the full heat of the sun would be encountered. Sir T. Holdich pointed out that the line described--not less than 1,600 miles long, from Basra to Karachi— would tap no considerable area of productive country,.and that the traffic along it would be unable to compete with traffic borne by sea. There was, however in his view, an inland line passing through highly developed and promising districts and entering into no local competition with sea traffic which was the only line in the country likely to be worth construction, viz., one that should run by Tehran, Kashan, Yezd, and Kerman, thence either to Kalat and Quetta, running easily though at high altitudes, or to Las Bela and Karachi. As regards a Russian railway from Trans-Caspia to the Persian Gulf, Sir T Holdich observed that such a line via Meshed, Turbat-i-Haidari and Kerman to Bunder Abbas would probably be 1,000 miles long (direct measurement —750 miles) and would cost five or six times as much as any other thousand miles of Russian railway in Asia. It would be easier to direct the line to Charbar instead of Bunder Abbas, but it would then lie strategically weak through exposure towards the Afghan frontier. “ It is improbable,” he wrote, “that Russia (even if she possessed a free “ hand) would commit herself to such a doubtful financial undertaking as the opening up of a I ersian Gulf post for purposes of trade only by means of a railway across the width of Persia.’ The construction by Russia of a naval station at Bunder Abbas would be a difficult and costly undertaking. The Gabes of India (1910), pages 318-324. In this work Sir T. Holdich says that the shortest line and the easiest through Persia to Karachi or Bombay is by way of Yezd, Kerman, Bam, Regan, Bampur, Ranjgur, and Las Bela. This would be commanded and protected from the sea. (IV.) Sir H. Norman, M.P., All the Russian (1902), pp. 217-8, 254-271, 412-448. Writing (1902) before the progress of the Bagdad Railway, and the Russo- Japanese War, Sir H. Norman said (page 256&lt;: “It is an absolutely determined “ part of her (i.e. Russia’s) policy to have an outlet on the Persian Gulf—to carry “ her south-western frontier to the warm water. With her present railway system, “ however, she does not feel strong enough to meet the opposition that this step— “ practically the annexation of Persia—might provoke.” Again (page 257) : “ Russia is extremely anxious to extend her railway system “ in Central Asia, (1) to bring her military centres into direct connection with the “ Afghan and Persian frontiers, in view of possible hostilities with England; (2) to “ secure for herself the future railway trade-route between Europe and India, by “ offering a shorter and cheaper line before the alternative route via Bagdad is “ constructed ; (3) by thus rendering the construction of this latter railway an “ unprofitable undertaking, to remove the one fatal obstacle to an ultimate port for “ h Tself upon the Persian Gulf; (4) to develop further her own Central Asian “ territories. From a Russian point of view the reasons are certainly convincing.” He next discussed a railway across Afghanistan from Merv and the Kushkinski post to New Chaman, and observed as follows (page 270):—“ In the first place, such “ a junction is absolutely certain to come some day, but the time may be far off. “ Second, if Russia were successful in a war against England, it would assuredly be “ one of her conditions of peace. Third, a railway would give little advantage to “ Russia that it would not give to England, for if it would enable Russia to hurry “ troops toward India, it would equally enable England to hurry Indian troops “ t jward Central Asia, and the final advantage would thus be, as it always is in war, “ t &gt; the quickest to act. Fourth, it would do much to remove international “ misunderstan ling, for it would bring intelligent and commercial Russians into “ India, and a similar class of English and Anglo-Indians into Russia. Finally, will “ not the moment soon come, when two civilised nations will refuse to allow an “ uncivilised regime, friendly at heart to neither and only friendly in action to one “ of them so long as self-interest dictates such a course, 0 to stand in the way of one * * This was written before the death of the late Amir of Afghanistan.70 of those great advances of intercommunication, which are the chief signs and promoters of civilisation? In view of these considerations, it can hardly be thought unreasonable for Russia to plan her Central Asian communications with a view to their ultimate extension to Central India.” lie believed (page dl8) that, though much secrecy is observed upon the matter, the railway which Russia hopes to lay through Persia to the sea, the route of ” which has already been roughly surveyed, is intended to start on the frontier at l( * V , l ’ an( V un T ’ m&lt;l A,,ar ’ to Tabriz &gt; Tehran, Isfahan, and Yezd, and past Bunder Abbas to the Indian Ocean.” .Again (page 401), he wrote ol the determination of Russia to secure at any cost the control of I'ersia and a naval and maritime outlet upon the Persian Gulf” and (page 440) he stated his views in the following passage “ 1 8eo no reason in British interests why Russia should not develop Persia as a market for her surplus manufactures, why she should not bring her goods and passengers to the sea through Persia, why she should not have a naval base in the ersian Gulf. But I see excellent reasons why she should not comedown to the I ersian Gulf and immediately extinguish British and Indian trade there, as she has virtually done in Centra! Asia, by the imposition* of absolutely prohibitive duties II sue would bind herself, by formal treaty, to admit all foreign goods to Persia and tianspoit lliein upon I ersian railways on precisely the same terms as Russian goods, she might, in my opinion, have Persia to-morrow, with all the vast advantage its possession would confer upon her.” Lieutenant-Colonel A. C. ^ ate, 77/e Proposed Persian Trans-Indian Railway. G’aper read before the Central Asian Society, 8th February 1911). Colonel Ante thinks that in process of time three railway systems will be ,’ompleted :—(1) Constantinople to Koweit, via Konia, Adana, and Bagdad; (2) Baku, across Persia and Baluchis an to the North-Western State Railwavof India- (o) Russian Turkestan through Afghanistan to the North-Western Frontier of India. As regards (3), he considers that Afghanistan will in the long run have to reconsider its attitude towards railways, and that, if the Trans-Persian rail wav is constructed, Meshed and Herat, as well as Kerman and Kandahar, will ultimately l&gt;e connected by rail. As (-) he prefers the name “ Indo-European ” to “ Trans-Persian.” He thinks it important that the ' internationality ' of the line and its branches should be rigidly safe guarded, and strongly criticises the Russian attitude in objecting on strategiesI grounds to a Turkish railway from Trebizond to Erzeroum, and thence to labm, and to the special negotiations undertaken by Russia with regard to the Khanikin-1 ehran line. He thinks there is something to be said for holding an international conference at which the Amir might be represented. As regards the lirwe of the Trans-Persian line, the country from Tehran to Kerman is not diiheult, but from Kerman to Nushki the line would pass through the desert known as I&gt;asht-i-Lut. and another to the west of Kharan ; also there are steep gradients from Nushki to Quetta, and again from Quetta to Sibi Colonel &gt;ato prefers, therefore, the line indicated in Sir T. Holdich’s book 'The Gates of India, from Kerman rm Bampur to Paujgur. From Panjgur the line would pass through Quetta, Hindu Bagh, and the Gonial Pass to Lahore, if Calcutta is to beits objective; and a branch might also l&gt;e made from Panjgur to Karachi. ..

Chapman supported the idea of a conference at which the Amir should he represented. Sir J. D.

Mr. G. Lloyd, M.P., spoke in favour of our supporting a railway from Damascus to Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. Mr. Chiral pointed out, as regards the Trehizond-Tabriz line, that it might he made by a French company with Russian consent. He thought a Damascus Persian Gulf line, supported by us, impracticable. Colonel C. E. Yate, M.P., dwelt on the importance to us of the Nudijeh Khanikin line. Mr.H. F.B. Lynch thought that the* prospects of the Trans Persian line were remote, since investors would require a Russo-British guarantee, and this the Russian Government would not give. Captain Macaulay pointer] out that there would have to be a break of gauge since the Russian gauge was f&gt; feet and the Indian standard gauge was &amp; ft &lt;} ms. The further north the break of gauge the better for us. “There could be no “ question that strategically it would be a great advantage for us for the line to run ‘‘ from Kerman vui Bampur. Phis route would have the great value of being ‘ within the influence of our sea-power, and also not have the same flunking effect ‘ on our North-Western Frontier jiosition that a Nushki line would have We “ should certainly stipulate that this should be the route of approach to India in the event of the Trans-Persian scheme materializing, and that we should also stipulate ‘‘ for construaction and control of any branch lines connecting the Tran* Persian Railway and the Persian Gulf. This would also be exnnmercially advantageous. 1 as it would give an opportunity of combining the longest sea-transport, and “ shortest land-transport.” Colonel A. C. Yate, in summing up, said tlmt he was a strong advocate of strengthening the British naval force in Indian seas. (VI.) Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, Railway* in tioe Middle Ea*t. (Paper read 1st March Pdl I before &lt; entrai Asian Society). Air. Lynch treats the Trans-Persian Railway as part of the wider system of railways in the Middle East. Like Colonel A. 0. Yate, lie thinks we should have access to any such line by way of Trebizond ami Er/eroum, and also die Persian Gulf- As regards the latter, he rejects a Bunder Abbas-Kerman line, at die threshold of the Gulf, in favour of one dirough the Karun Valley, which might l*e carried on to Ispahan. iieaJjng with the Bagdad Railway, lie emphasises die strategical aspect of die line, quoting from a German writer, Or. Rohrbach, to prove that Turkey is being used by Germany as an instrujnewt against Great Britain, lie thinks that we should concentrate to obtain equal treatment for British g&lt;x&gt;ds on the Sadijeh-Khanikin line, a route already traversed by more than wo/th of British merchajidise. Commercially, a railway between Jiagdad and the Gulf would, lie thinks, be of comparatively little use, and would even prejudice our trade if built with the proceeds of a 4 per cent, increase in the Customs duties. In die discusrion that followed, Mr. Lynch’s view's as to the unimportance of die Bag lad-Basra branch were called in question by LofnJ Ronaidshay, Mr. ihoyd, H P,, and others, but his views as to the Sadijek-Kdianikin branch received eupj&gt;&lt;;n. Air. lloyd advocated a line Rom Kut, below Bagdad, to the Pvisj&amp;jj. froiitier. Colonel A. C. Yate adhered to his opinion tliat the Trans-Persian Railway was very likely to be built, and he thought it would be strategically safe. Captain Macaulay spoke in favour of Indian isolation. ii(VII.) . Captain J. H. F. Lakin,- 92nd Punjabis, British Relations with Persia and with Russia in that Country, and the Possibilities of Railway Develoj)- rnent on Persian Soil. (Journal of the United Service Institution of India, July 1910), pp. 379-90 (with Map). The author gives a useful historical account, with dates, of relations between Great Britain and Persia, and then goes on to a discussion of railways. Russian Lines .—He thinks that for many reasons a line from Julfa through Tabriz and Kasvin to the capital will be the first line to be constructed in Persia under Russian auspices. It would connect with the mercantile capital of Persia (Tabriz), open up Ajarbaizan, strengthen Russia’s grasp on the northern provinces, and be the first step towards the connection of the Trans-Caucasian and Trans- Caspian systems. A corollary to this line would be one from Baku to Tehran via Lenkoran, Astara, and Resht, with a junction at Kazvin, to be continued to Meshed via Bander-i-Gez, Astarabad, the Gurgan Valley. Bujnurd, and Kuchan, with a branch from Kuehan to Askhabad on the Central Asian Railway. Other lines that have been proposed are : — (i.) Dushak, on Central Asian Railway via Sarakhs and Pul-i-Khatun to Meshed, with branches to Kushk Post and to Kariz via Zulfikar. (ii.) Tehran to Meshed via Shahrud. (Hi.) Bagdad to Tehran via Kermanshah and Hamadan. (iv.) Tehran to Yezd via Kum, Kashan, and Ispahan, or Kum, Gulpaigan, and Ispahan. (v.) Kermanshah-Burujird-Gulpaigan. The line Julfa-Tabriz-Tehran-lspahan-Yezd might become “ the nucleus of the “ Trans-Persian line which has been the dream of more than one railway concession hunter.” British Lines .—Captain Lakin enumerates, in order of importance— (i.) Mohammerah-Shushtar, with a possible extension through Dizful to Khoremabad. (ii.) Nushki-Seistan. (Hi.) Chahbar-Kerman via Regan and Bam. In the event of the Trans-Persian line being seriously considered, we should obtain control over the Yezd-Kerman section in the neutral zone. On the ground of physical difficulties he dismisses the idea of direct connection between th®Bagdad Railway and the Indian system. There is much in favour of the connection of Bushire with Shiraz and Kerman, but the work would be very difficult.

This includes discussion of the potential advantages/disadvantages (both commercial and political) for the British in the construction of railways in Southern Persia, and the potential threat posed by the expansion of Russian railways in Northern Persia towards British India, Afghanistan, and the Persian Gulf. Proposals for various schemes are included, from those limited to internal routes within Persia, to schemes designed to link the rail networks of India and Russia via a Trans-Persian link. Consideration is also given to British and Russian efforts to maintain their spheres of influence in Persia, and their joint desire to resist any encroachment by Germany.The memorandum is signed by John Edward Ferard, India Office.The appendix (folios 123-132) contains supporting extracts from various papers (aide-mémoires, correspondence, memoranda, minutes, and published writings). This includes the following:an extract from a minute by George Nathaniel Curzon, Viceroy of India, dated 4 September 1899, respecting the importance of Seistan [Sīstān] to the maintenance of British influence in Southern Persia (ff 123-124);an extract from a minute by the Viceroy of India, dated 28 October 1901, respecting the potential threat of increasing Russian influence in Persia to Britain's strategic and commercial interests in the Persian Gulf (ff 124-125v);an extract from the Anglo-Persian Agreement (31 August 1907) respecting Persia (ff 125v-126);various communications between British, Persian, and Russian authorities on the topic of railway construction in Persia (ff 126-130);extracts from various published sources on the subject of railways in Persia (ff 130-132).An index to the memorandum can be found on folios 134-136.
